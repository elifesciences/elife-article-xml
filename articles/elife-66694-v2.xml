These diseases account for extensive morbidity and mortality as there are no approved therapies. SARM1 has recently emerged as a promising therapeutic target for diseases associated with axonal degeneration because SARM1 knockdown or knockout prevents axonal degeneration and disease pathology (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Geisler et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Henninger et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Loring and Thompson, 2020</xref>).</p><p>SARM1 was originally identified in a screen that selected for mutants that suppress injury–induced axonal degeneration (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Osterloh et al., 2012</xref>). However, it was unknown how SARM1 loss prevented neurodegeneration post–injury. Subsequently, SARM1 was shown to possess enzymatic activity and catalyze the hydrolysis of NAD<sup>+</sup> (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1A</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Essuman et al., 2017</xref>). Depletion of the NAD<sup>+</sup> pool promotes degeneration, whereas inactive variants of SARM1 or supplementation with NAD<sup>+</sup> precursors and minimizing NMN accumulation prevent degeneration after injury (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Essuman et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Gerdts et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib40">Wang et al., 2015</xref>).</p><fig id="fig1" position="float"><label>Figure 1.</label><caption><title>SARM1 reaction and domain structure.</title><p>(<bold>A</bold>) SARM1-mediated hydrolysis of NAD<sup>+</sup> results in the production of nicotinamide and a mixture of ADPR and cADPR.

The TIR domain contains a BB loop (Residues 594–605), which is thought to promote self–association, and a SARM1–specific (SS) loop (Residues 622–635), which is a characteristic feature of catalytically active TIR domains; TIR domains lacking this loop do not possess enzymatic activity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Carlsson et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Horsefield et al., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Loring and Thompson, 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">Summers et al., 2016</xref>). Additionally, E642 (within the TIR domain and adjacent to the SS loop) is thought to be a key catalytic residue based on structural alignments with other nucleotide hydrolases and mutagenesis studies (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Essuman et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Gerdts et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Gerdts et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Loring and Thompson, 2020</xref>). In the absence of disease, the ARM domain is thought to inhibit catalysis via an intramolecular interaction with the TIR domain as deletion of this domain results in constitutively active SARM1 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Chuang and Bargmann, 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Gerdts et al., 2013</xref>). This hypothesis is supported by recent cryoEM structures of the inactive enzyme, which show that SARM1 exists as an octamer with the ARM domain binding to the TIR domain (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Bratkowski et al., 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Jiang et al., 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">Sporny et al., 2020</xref>). Mutations that disrupt the TIR–ARM interface or delete the ARM domain entirely, however, only activate SARM1 by ~1.8- to 2.4-fold (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Jiang et al., 2020</xref>). Thus, the fully active conformation/state of the TIR domains remains to be determined.</p><p>Although SARM1 inhibitors hold therapeutic promise, efforts to study the purified enzyme have been complicated by the fact that SARM1 appears to lose activity during purification and only shows measurable NAD<sup>+</sup> hydrolase activity when assayed at a final enzyme concentration of ≥ 20 µM (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Horsefield et al., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Loring et al., 2020a</xref>). By contrast, enzymatic activity is 800-fold higher in lysates or when activity is measured on–bead (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Essuman et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Horsefield et al., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Loring et al., 2020a</xref>). These data indicate that the pure protein does not fully recapitulate all features of SARM1 catalysis. Herein, we report that macroviscogens induce a phase transition that increases in vitro SARM1 activity by &gt;2000-fold. By exploiting this finding, we report the first detailed studies of SARM1 catalysis. Additionally, we demonstrate that a point mutation which reduces multimerization and precipitation in vitro, also disrupts this phase transition in cell culture. We further show that citrate induces axonal degeneration in <italic>C. elegans</italic> that is dependent on the <italic>C. elegans</italic> orthologue of SARM1 (i.e. TIR–1). Notably, citrate induces the formation of larger puncta indicating that TIR–1/SARM1 undergoes a phase transition that is essential for degeneration in vivo. In total, these findings will aid efforts to therapeutically target SARM1 to treat neurodegenerative diseases as they improve our understanding of SARM1 activation and its role as a critical switch in the degenerative process resulting in catastrophic axonal fragmentation.</p></sec><sec id="s2" sec-type="results|discussion"><title>Results and discussion</title><p>We previously established that SARM1 loses activity during purification and is essentially inactive unless purified to high micromolar concentrations (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2A</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Loring et al., 2020a</xref>). We initially hypothesized that the lack of activity could be explained by the loss of an essential element during enzyme purification. However, the addition of purified SARM1 to cell lysates did not activate the enzyme (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2B</xref>). We then hypothesized that pure SARM1 adopts an inactive conformation. To investigate this hypothesis, we evaluated the effect of enzyme concentration (5–35 µM) on the rates of catalysis. Notably, the concentration dependence has parabolic character, increasing with upward curvature, as opposed to linearly, suggesting the formation of a more active oligomer (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2C</xref>). The fact that pure SARM1 regains activity upon concentration, is inconsistent with the loss of an essential cofactor during purification. To investigate the oligomerization status of the SARM1 TIR domain, we next performed analytical ultracentrifugation (AUC). SARM1 was largely monomeric (~90%), as indicated by an S-value of 1.9–2.0S (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2D</xref>). A smaller peak at ~3.9–4.2S, which showed rightward tailing indicates that the remaining ~10% exists as a trimer or tetramer (~71–88 kDa) with a smaller fraction in higher ordered forms. Similar oligomerization levels were observed at the two different SARM1 concentrations tested (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2D</xref>).</p><fig-group><fig id="fig2" position="float"><label>Figure 2.</label><caption><title>Effect of crowding agents on activity.</title><p>(<bold>A</bold>) Activity of crude lysate, clarified lysate, and elution during SARM1 purification (n=2).

To test this hypothesis, we measured the activity of SARM1 in the presence of several macroviscogens (i.e. PEG 8000, 3350, 1500, 400, and Dextran) and microviscogens (i.e. Sucrose and Glycerol). Microviscogens are often used as protein stabilizers and affect the ability of small molecules to diffuse in solution, whereas macroviscogens alter the free volume available for a molecule to move within a solution with little effect on diffusion (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Blacklow et al., 1988</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Gadda and Sobrado, 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Hagen, 2010</xref>). Therefore, microviscogens can reveal effects on diffusional processes, whereas macroviscogens affect molecular crowding (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Gadda and Sobrado, 2018</xref>). Notably, we found that all the macroviscogens tested increased activity, whereas the microviscogens had negligible effects (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2E</xref>). Specifically, PEGs 8000, 3350, 1500, and 400 increased activity by 1500, 2000, 1900, and 200–fold, respectively. By contrast, dextran (36–50 kDa) only increased activity by 14–fold (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2E</xref>). To better visualize the effect of PEG 3350 on the rate of the reaction, representative progress curves are shown at 20 µM SARM1 with and without PEG (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2F</xref>). The 20 µM reaction with PEG 3350 plateaus after ~ 350 s, whereas the fluorescence of the reaction without PEG increases at a much slower rate. In total, these data indicate that a subset of macroviscogens dramatically increase SARM1 activity by up to 2000–fold.</p><p>To determine how macroviscogens increase SARM1 catalysis, the activity of SARM1 (10 µM final) was next measured at 0, 10, 20, and 30% w/v of the macroviscogens and glycerol. Consistent with our hypothesis, we observed a dose–dependent increase in activity for all the macroviscogens tested (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2G</xref>). Notably, activity increases according to macroviscogen size until a critical point is reached where PEG 1500 and PEG 3350 have similar effects (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2G</xref>). Note that the effect on activity is not purely due to a change in viscosity, as the enhancement in activity shows a poor correlation (R<sup>2</sup>=0.46) with viscosity (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2H</xref>). For example, when dextran and PEG 3350 are assayed at similar relative viscosities, the fold activation is dramatically different (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2H–I</xref>). Additionally, when the viscosity of glycerol was compared to that of PEG 3350, we found that glycerol did not enhance activity to the same degree as PEG 3350, despite having a similar relative viscosity (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s1">Figure 2—figure supplement 1A–B</xref>).</p><p>As PEG 3350 showed the greatest ability to enhance activity, we proceeded to investigate its effect on SARM1 activity further. Initially, we evaluated the effect of enzyme concentration on activity in the presence and absence of PEG 3350 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2J</xref>). SARM1 concentration was varied from 300 nM to 20 µM with 25% w/v PEG 3350 and from 5 to 35 µM in the absence of PEG 3350. Our data show that the addition of 25% w/v PEG 3350 accelerates the rate of reaction 7700-fold at 5 µM, 1400-fold at 10 µM, and ~280-fold at 20 µM of SARM1 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2J</xref>). These data indicate that the effect of PEG 3350 is dependent on enzyme concentration. Furthermore, SARM1 activity appears to increase almost linearly with respect to concentration in the presence of PEG after a slight lag phase, but parabolically in its absence (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2J</xref>). This trend suggests that in the absence of PEG, there is a gradual build up in activity as the concentration of SARM1 increases, until the concentration surpasses a critical threshold allowing for increased transient interactions and a consequent large increase in activity (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2J</xref>). By contrast, the addition of PEG reduces the concentration of enzyme needed to reach this threshold. One potential explanation is that PEG induces molecular crowding by excluding water from the protein surfaces, thereby promoting multimerization and catalysis. Along these lines, we note that in the absence of PEG the Hill coefficient is 3.8, indicating a high degree of cooperativity, whereas in the presence of PEG (0–25%) the Hill coefficient decreases to 1.3, suggesting that PEG decreases the dependence on the cooperative formation of an active multimer (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s1">Figure 2—figure supplement 1C–D</xref>).</p><p>Next, we evaluated the potency of several metals that were previously shown to inhibit SARM1 when assayed in lysates (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Loring et al., 2020a</xref>). Notably, NiCl<sub>2</sub> and ZnCl<sub>2</sub> completely eliminated activity in the presence of PEG (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s2">Figure 2—figure supplement 2A</xref>). This result is consistent with our previous data (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Loring et al., 2020a</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Loring et al., 2020b</xref>). Expanding on these studies, we also evaluated several other metal ions including CaCl<sub>2</sub>, CdCl<sub>2</sub>, CoCl<sub>2</sub>, CuCl<sub>2</sub>, MgCl<sub>2</sub>, and MnCl<sub>2</sub> (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s2">Figure 2—figure supplement 2A</xref>). Of note, CdCl<sub>2</sub>, CoCl<sub>2</sub>, and CuCl<sub>2</sub>, decreased activity in the presence of the pure protein but not in lysates. This inconsistency could be due to elements in the lysate preferentially sequestering these metals and thereby preventing their ability to act on SARM1. Given the high potency of CdCl<sub>2</sub> and CuCl<sub>2</sub>, we used these inhibitors to titrate the enzyme and determine the percentage of active enzyme (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s2">Figure 2—figure supplement 2B</xref>). Based on these data, all the enzyme appears to be active. Although speculative, the fact that thiophilic metals (i.e. CdCl<sub>2</sub>, CoCl<sub>2</sub>, CuCl<sub>2</sub>, NiCl<sub>2</sub>, and ZnCl<sub>2</sub>) inhibit SARM1 suggests the presence of a catalytically important thiol. Along these lines, we previously showed that C629 and C635, which are present in the SARM1 specific loop, are critical for activity in the absence of PEG (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Loring et al., 2020b</xref>).</p><p>We next determined an IC<sub>50</sub> value for ZnCl<sub>2</sub> as this compound was previously shown to potently inhibit the SARM1 TIR domain assayed in lysates. Consistent with our prior data, the IC<sub>50</sub> value obtained in the presence of PEG is 10 ± 1 µM, which is very similar to that in lysates (10 ± 3 µM) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Loring et al., 2020a</xref>), and with purified protein without PEG (10 ± 1 µM) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Loring et al., 2020b</xref>; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2K</xref>, <xref ref-type="table" rid="table1">Table 1</xref>). To further confirm that the addition of PEG 3350 was not introducing any confounding variables, we repeated the mechanism of inhibition studies with ZnCl<sub>2</sub>. As before, we found that ZnCl<sub>2</sub> inhibits SARM1 noncompetitively with a <italic>K</italic><sub>i</sub> value of 1.0 ± 0.1 µM.

Berberine chloride inhibited SARM1 in the presence of PEG with an IC<sub>50</sub> value of 140 ± 30 µM. This value is quite similar to its potency in lysates (140 ± 20 µM) and when assayed with purified SARM1 without PEG 3350 (140 ± 20 µM) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2M</xref> and <xref ref-type="table" rid="table1">Table 1</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Loring et al., 2020b</xref>). As before, we found that berberine chloride inhibits SARM1 noncompetitively in the presence of PEG 3350 with a <italic>K</italic><sub>i</sub> value of 120 ± 10 µM.

Since PEGs are typically used as precipitants, we hypothesized that PEG3350 was precipitating and activating SARM1. Consistent with this hypothesis, we found that the addition of PEG 3350 (25% w/v) results in the formation of an active precipitate, whereas the protein in buffer without PEG remains soluble (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3A</xref>). These data indicate that the observed rate enhancement is driven by a phase transition. Next, we evaluated the effect of protein and PEG concentration on this phase transition. We found that both enzyme (5–20 µM) and PEG (0–25%) concentration enhanced precipitate formation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3B–C</xref>). As the concentration of SARM1 in the supernatant decreases, the precipitate concentration increases with a corresponding increase in enzyme activity. This effect is evident by the absence of a pellet for 0% PEG, a faint band at 10% PEG, and darker bands at 17.5% and 25% PEG at 5, 10, and 20 µM SARM1, and the inverse trend for the supernatant (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3C</xref>). To determine whether other precipitants increase SARM1 activity, we screened several common precipitants and found that citrate both precipitated and acted as a second highly potent activator of SARM1 activity (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s1">Figure 3—figure supplement 1A</xref>).</p><fig-group><fig id="fig3" position="float"><label>Figure 3.</label><caption><title>PEG 3350 induces a phase transition.</title><p>(<bold>A</bold>) Activity of pre-centrifugation, supernatant, and precipitate fractions obtained before and after treatment of 20 µM SARM1 with and without 25% PEG 3350.

We found that while 1,6–hexanediol inhibited the activity of pure protein alone, it did not substantially affect the activity of SARM1 in the presence of PEG or sodium citrate (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3D–E</xref>). These data suggests that the activity of the pure protein is dominated by weak hydrophobic interactions or a liquid-to-liquid phase separation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3D</xref>). On the other hand, the fact that 1,6-hexanediol does not eliminate the activity of pure protein in the presence of PEG or sodium citrate, supports SARM1 undergoing a liquid-to-solid phase transition in these cases (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3E</xref>). To confirm that precipitate formation is reversible, we performed the centrifugation experiment in the presence of PEG or sodium citrate and tested the activity of the fractions (pre-centrifugation, supernatant, precipitate resuspended in buffer, and precipitate resuspended with buffer plus additive) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s1">Figure 3—figure supplement 1B</xref>). The lack of both a precipitate and activity in the precipitate resuspended in buffer confirm that precipitation is reversible. To see if select additives/inhibitors affect precipitation of SARM1, we quantified the precipitation percentage with PEG or citrate in the presence of Zn, NMN, Ca, and berberine and found that none of these additives affected precipitation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s1">Figure 3—figure supplement 1C–D</xref>).</p><p>Having established that both PEG 3350 and sodium citrate enhance SARM1-mediated NAD<sup>+</sup> hydrolysis via a phase transition, we next sought to investigate how this phase transition enhances activity. To that end, we performed negative stain EM in the absence and presence of sodium citrate (500 mM) to determine how the precipitant affects activity and oligomeric state (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3F–G</xref>). Surprisingly, we were able to detect the SARM1 TIR domain even in the absence of additive, which suggests the TIR domain alone is forming a higher ordered oligomer. The median diameter of the particles is ~8 nm or ~80 Å, which closely aligns with the diameter predicted for an octameric ring of the TIR domain; recent crystal and cryoEM structures of the SAM domains and full-length protein, respectively, show that SARM1 forms an octameric ring (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Bratkowski et al., 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">Sporny et al., 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">Sporny et al., 2019</xref>). In the presence of sodium citrate, the SARM1 TIR domain forms significantly larger ring–like structures, potentially by wrapping around on itself (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3G</xref>, p&lt;0.00001). Notably, the mean area is 172 nm<sup>2</sup> (SEM = 5.2, n=100) in the presence of citrate compared to 66 nm<sup>2</sup> (SEM = 1.9, n = 100) without additive (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3H</xref>). These data suggest that precipitants like PEG 3350 and sodium citrate enhance SARM1 activity by inducing the formation of a higher ordered oligomer and facilitating inter–TIR domain contacts necessary for NAD<sup>+</sup> hydrolysis.</p><p>We next sought to exploit the additive–induced rate enhancement to perform the first detailed analysis of SARM1 catalysis. First, we determined how pH affects activity and precipitate formation. We found that the catalytic efficiency (<italic>k</italic><sub>cat</sub>/<italic>K</italic><sub>m</sub>) peaks from pH 6–8, which is primarily due to an effect on <italic>k</italic><sub>cat</sub>, as the <italic>K</italic><sub>m</sub> value remains nearly constant across the range tested (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3I</xref>). Furthermore, the effect of pH on activity appears to be independent of precipitation as the precipitate percentage varies by only 10% across the range tested. Notably, the pH profile for <italic>k</italic><sub>cat</sub> is bell-shaped with p<italic>K</italic><sub>a</sub> values of 4.9 ± 0.2 and 8.8 ± 0.2 for the ascending and descending limbs, respectively. The p<italic>K</italic><sub>a</sub> value for the ascending limb is consistent with the previous suggestion that a glutamate, likely E642, acts as a key catalytic residue (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Essuman et al., 2017</xref>).</p><p>We next evaluated the effect of PEG on the steady state kinetic parameters in the presence of 10 µM SARM1. In the presence of 25% PEG, the <italic>K</italic><sub>m</sub> decreases 3.3-fold, whereas <italic>k</italic><sub>cat</sub> and <italic>k</italic><sub>cat</sub>/<italic>K</italic><sub>m</sub> increase by 2000- and 7000-fold, respectively (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4A</xref>). The fact that the increase in <italic>k</italic><sub>cat</sub>/<italic>K</italic><sub>m</sub> is dominated by an increase in <italic>k</italic><sub>cat</sub>, suggests that PEG promotes multimerization and activity via precipitate formation. To further interrogate how PEG impacts the activity of SARM1, we performed detailed steady state kinetic experiments at various PEG concentrations from 0 to 25% (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4B</xref>). We found that increasing concentrations of PEG 3350 cause the <italic>K</italic><sub>m</sub> value to decrease and level off at ~500 µM (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4C</xref>) and the <italic>k</italic><sub>cat</sub> to increase almost linearly (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4D</xref>).

Of particular note is the fact that PEG makes kinetic studies feasible at 500 nM of SARM1, which is near the concentration studied in lysates (300 nM) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Loring et al., 2020a</xref>). Specifically, at 500 nM of SARM1 with PEG, the <italic>K</italic><sub>m</sub> is 1600 µM, the <italic>k</italic><sub>cat</sub> is 0.24 s<sup>–1</sup>, and the catalytic efficiency is 150 M<sup>–1</sup>s<sup>–1</sup> (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4F–J</xref>, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="supp1">Supplementary file 1b</xref>). Notably, the <italic>K</italic><sub>m</sub> value at 500 nM with PEG is similar to that at 20 µM SARM1 without PEG (1200 µM); however, the <italic>k</italic><sub>cat</sub> is ~100-fold greater in the presence of PEG (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4F–J</xref>, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="supp1">Supplementary file 1b</xref>). These data suggest that by inducing a phase transition, PEG drastically enhances enzymatic turnover, but has little effect on substrate binding. Although the <italic>K</italic><sub>m</sub> value slightly decreases as SARM1 or PEG concentration increases, it remains much higher than the lysate value of 40 ± 10 µM (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Loring et al., 2020a</xref>), indicating that PEG/SARM1 concentration does not completely recapitulate SARM1 activity in the lysate or on-bead (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4</xref>, <xref ref-type="table" rid="table2">Table 2</xref>). The similarities in <italic>k</italic><sub>cat</sub>/<italic>K</italic><sub>m</sub>, however, suggest compensation (i.e. alterations in rate limiting steps) between these two parameters. Moreover, the fact that <italic>k</italic><sub>cat</sub> is directly correlated with enzyme and PEG concentration, suggests that turnover rate is largely dependent on the multimeric state and the formation of an ordered oligomer. While the <italic>k</italic><sub>cat</sub>/<italic>K</italic><sub>m</sub> values obtained for SARM1 (~2000 M-1s-1) are not particularly robust, they are in-line with other eukaryotic enzymes that we have studied (e.g. the protein arginine deiminases, protein arginine methyltransferases, and nicotinamide N-methyltransferase <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Knuckley et al., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Knuckley et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Loring and Thompson, 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Osborne et al., 2007</xref>), and the slow kinetics likely relate to the fact that degeneration occurs on the hour time scale (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Mack et al., 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Osterloh et al., 2012</xref>).</p><p>Next, we evaluated the product specificity of SARM1 with PEG and sodium citrate using an orthogonal LC-MS-based assay. We found that the addition of PEG or citrate led to a time-dependent decrease in NAD<sup>+</sup> levels that coincided with increased levels of nicotinamide and a mixture of ADPR and cADPR (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5A–B</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5s1">Figure 5—figure supplement 1A–B</xref>). Of note, the ADPR to cADPR ratios are consistent over time under each condition (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5C</xref>), indicating that cADPR is a poor substrate relative to NAD<sup>+</sup>. Interestingly, the addition of PEG increases the production of ADPR relative to cADPR from a ratio of 10 ± 2 to a ratio of 16 ± 1. This ratio is further increased in the presence of citrate to 23 ± 3 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5D</xref>). We hypothesize that this could be due to the multimeric state of the enzyme constraining NAD<sup>+</sup> in such a position that it favors hydrolysis by water as compared to reaction with the N1 of the adenosine, which is required for cyclization. We also evaluated whether SARM1 could cleave cADPR in the presence or absence of additive (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5s2">Figure 5—figure supplement 2A–C</xref>). Consistent with our prior finding that SARM1 follows an ordered uni–bi kinetic mechanism instead of a sequential intermediate mechanism, SARM1 is unable to cleave cADPR in the absence of additive and in the presence of sodium citrate (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Loring et al., 2020a</xref>; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5s2">Figure 5—figure supplement 2A–C</xref>). Further support comes from a single turnover experiment where SARM1 concentration exceeded the NAD<sup>+</sup> concentration and the ADPR/cADPR ratio remains nearly constant over the time range observed, indicating that SARM1 does not cleave cADPR under these conditions (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5s3">Figure 5—figure supplement 3A–B</xref>). Interestingly, however, SARM1 slowly cleaves cADPR in the presence of PEG, resulting in the time-dependent production of ADPR (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5s3">Figure 5—figure supplement 3C–D</xref>). Additionally, we found that cADPR inhibits SARM1 in the presence of PEG with an IC<sub>50</sub> of 100 ± 10 µM and a competitive inhibition pattern, supporting its role as a poor substrate under these conditions (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5s3">Figure 5—figure supplement 3E–F</xref>).</p><fig-group><fig id="fig5" position="float"><label>Figure 5.</label><caption><title>SARM1 reaction products and mutagenesis.</title><p>(<bold>A</bold>) Representative time course of SARM1 with PEG, depicting the A<sub>254</sub> nm for ADPR, cADPR, nicotinamide, and NAD<sup>+</sup> (n=3).

Notably, we found that adenosine substitutions are well tolerated as etheno–NAD (ENAD), nicotinamide guanine dinucleotide (NGD) and nicotinamide hypoxanthine dinucleotide (NHD) are all processed by SARM1. By contrast, SARM1 does not cleave NADH or NHDH, the reduced forms of NAD<sup>+</sup> and NHD, in the absence or presence of PEG. This finding likely relates to nicotinamide being a better leaving group than its reduced form, and/or conformational preferences; nicotinamide is planar whereas the reduced form adopts a puckered conformation. Along these lines, SARM1 can still cleave nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide phosphate (NADP<sup>+</sup>) but cannot accommodate the flavin substitution for nicotinamide in flavin adenine dinucleotide (FAD). SARM1 can also cleave thionicotinamide adenine dinucleotide (sNAD), which has a thiol substitution for the carbonyl. Interestingly, low level cleavage was observed for nicotinamide mononucleotide (NMN), but not for nicotinic acid mononucleotide (NaMN) nor nicotinic acid adenine dinucleotide (NaAD), suggesting that SARM1 cannot accommodate a carboxylic acid substitution at this position. However, SARM1 can accommodate a methyl substitution at the same site as it will cleave 3-acetylpyridine adenine dinucleotide (3apAD). Adenosine triphosphate (ATP), adenosine diphosphate (ADP), guanosine triphosphate (GTP) and ara-F-NAD<sup>+</sup> were also not cleaved by SARM1, nor did they inhibit SARM1 cleavage of NAD<sup>+</sup>. Ara-F-NAD<sup>+</sup> has a fluorine substitution for a hydroxyl with opposite stereochemistry, which likely interferes with coordination to the active site as no cleavage or inhibition was evident.</p><p>Next, we generated mutant constructs to understand how specific residues contribute to catalysis and multimerization. Residues were selected based on their proposed roles in multimerization, catalysis, or location in the SARM1 specific loop (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5E</xref>). All the mutants examined showed a marked reduction in catalytic efficiency, <italic>k</italic><sub>cat</sub>/<italic>K</italic><sub>m</sub>, ranging from 100- to 2000-fold (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5F</xref>). Interestingly, the most extreme effect was observed for the E642A mutant, which has previously been suggested to be a key catalytic residue based on structural alignments with other glycohydrolases (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Essuman et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5F</xref>). Consistent with a role in multimerization the Y568, G601, H640, and H685 mutants showed reduced precipitation, suggesting that the loss in activity observed upon their mutation is due in part to a reduction in multimer formation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5G</xref>).</p><p>While <italic>k</italic><sub>cat</sub> values were reduced by ~100- to 400-fold for all mutants examined, a subset showed a &gt;4–fold increase in <italic>K</italic><sub>m</sub>, including residues thought to be involved in multimerization, that is, Y568, G601, W638, H640, and E686, and possible catalytic residues, K628 and E642. Several of these mutants have been previously characterized in the context of the purified protein and degenerating axons (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Horsefield et al., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">Summers et al., 2016</xref>). Consistent with our results, they also found that TIR domain mutants E642A, Y568A, H685A, and BB loop mutations (D594A and G601P) reduce NAD<sup>+</sup> hydrolase activity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Horsefield et al., 2019</xref>). Moreover, several of these mutations, including G601P, D627K, K628D, and C629S, were sufficient to prevent axonal degeneration post–axotomy, indicating that they render SARM1 non-functional (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">Summers et al., 2016</xref>).</p><p>To investigate the multimeric state of SARM1 in cells, we transfected HEK293T cells with a GFP-tagged SAMTIR–E642A construct; this mutant construct should multimerize like wild-type SARM1 without exhibiting toxicity due to the rapid depletion of NAD<sup>+</sup> (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6A–B</xref>). We found that this GFP tagged SARM1 SAMTIR construct forms puncta in cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6A–B</xref>). To demonstrate that these puncta are due to SARM1 oligomerization we transfected cells with a construct encoding GFP–tagged SAMTIR-E642A plus an additional G601P mutation. G601 has been previously implicated as an association interface for TIR domains during SARM1 activation, and we demonstrated that the BB loop mutation G601P, reduces both activity and precipitation in vitro (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5F–G</xref>). Moreover, the G601P mutation has previously been shown to block axon degeneration in cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Gerdts et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">Sporny et al., 2019</xref>). Notably, the G601P point mutation also reduces SARM1 puncta formation in HEK293T cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6A–C</xref>). Based on spot counts, the IDEAS software spot count wizard identified buckets of distinct sub–populations (0–28; R1 and R2). Specifically, cells expressing the E642A mutant show a higher frequency of puncta (34.4% of cells) whereas the majority of cells expressing the E642A/G601P double mutant were classified into the R1 or baseline fluorescence group (96.3%), with a smaller percentage exhibiting puncta characterized as the R2 group (3.7%) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6A–C</xref>). Since the SAM domains are involved in octamerization, which is not impacted by the G601P mutation, these data indicate that puncta formation is largely driven by the TIR domain.</p><fig-group><fig id="fig6" position="float"><label>Figure 6.</label><caption><title>G601P disrupts SARM1 puncta formation in HEK293T cells and citrate induces the formation of larger puncta in <italic>C.elegans</italic>.</title><p>(<bold>A</bold>) Normalized frequency of GFP-positive 7AAD-negative HEK293T cells expressing either GFP–tagged E642A (20,927 cells) or GFP–tagged E642A G601P (9895 cells) in the context of a SAMTIR construct.

To this end, we opted to study the SARM1 orthologue, TIR-1 in the GABA motor nervous system of <italic>C. elegans. C. elegans</italic> encodes several TIR-1 splice variants including TIR-1b and TIR-1d which lack the ARM domain (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6s1">Figure 6—figure supplement 1A</xref>) but contain the tandem SAM domains essential for octamer formation. Since TIR-1b was used in our in vivo studies (see below), we expressed and purified an MBP-tagged ceSAMTIR expression construct as a mimic of TIR-1b and evaluated whether citrate activates this construct. As a control, we also evaluated the effect of citrate on the <italic>C. elegans</italic> TIR domain (ceTIR). Like the human TIR domain, the NAD<sup>+</sup> hydrolase activity of both ceTIR and ceSAMTIR was greater with citrate, where ceTIR and ceSAMTIR activity were enhanced 22-fold and 1.4-fold respectively (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6s1">Figure 6—figure supplement 1B</xref>). While citrate does not activate the ceSAMTIR construct to the same extent as the ceTIR domain alone, mutations that disrupt the TIR–ARM interface or deletion of the ARM domain activate SARM1 to a similar extent (i.e. 1.8- to 2.4-fold) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Jiang et al., 2020</xref>).</p><p>Having demonstrated that ceSAMTIR activity is enhanced by citrate, we sought to determine whether ceSAMTIR undergoes a phase transition. To do this, we incubated ceSAMTIR with increasing concentrations of citrate, centrifuged the samples, removed the soluble fraction, and resuspended the insoluble pelleted fraction. All fractions were analyzed by SDS-PAGE for the presence of ceSAMTIR. At citrate concentrations 250 mM and below, ceSAMTIR was predominantly located in the supernatant. By contrast, at citrate concentrations of 500 mM and above, the protein was increasingly found in the pellet, such that at 1000 mM citrate, ceSAMTIR was primarily located in the pellet. Moreover, enzymatic activity in the fractions correlated with the location of ceSAMTIR (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6s1">Figure 6—figure supplement 1C</xref>). These data are consistent with the hypothesis that longer versions of SARM1/TIR-1 also undergo a phase transition that correlates with enzyme activation.</p><p>The <italic>C. elegans</italic> GABA motor nervous system is composed of neurons that have cell bodies along the ventral nerve cord and extend axon commissures circumferentially around the body of the worm to the dorsal nerve cord. We visualized the GABA motor nervous system and TIR-1 using a transgenic strain that expresses cytosolic GFP and mScarlet::TIR-1b specifically in GABA motor neurons (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6D</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Julian and Byrne, 2020</xref>). Consistent with our cell culture studies, TIR-1 forms puncta in axons under basal conditions (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6D</xref>). Given our demonstration that citrate activates SARM1 in vitro, we sought to determine whether citrate could alter TIR-1 expression and puncta formation in vivo. For these studies, L4 stage worms were exposed to 8 mM citrate and imaged 2–3 hr and 24 hr later. After 2–3 hr, no difference was observed in the mean number of puncta between untreated control worms and worms that were exposed to citrate (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6E</xref>). However, there was a significant increase in mean puncta area seen in citrate treated worms (mean=84.83, SEM=4.03, n=902) compared to untreated control animals (mean=58.42, SEM=3.45, n=739) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6F–G</xref>). Note that the increase in puncta size was not a secondary consequence of gross axon morphology as the presence and size of mScarlet puncta does not coincide with the expression pattern of cytosolic GFP (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6H</xref>). Together these data support that citrate treatment not only enhances the activity of SARM1 by inducing oligomerization in vitro but also facilitates multimerization in vivo as evidenced by the formation of larger puncta in <italic>C. elegans</italic> axons.</p><p>Given that citrate induces the formation of larger TIR-1 puncta in <italic>C. elegans</italic> axons, we determined whether this translates into downstream axonal degeneration. To this end, axons were analyzed at 2–3 hr and again at 24 hr post-citrate treatment. Axon commissures that were broken or fragmented, truncated, or missing were counted as damaged (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6I</xref>). No significant change in the percentage of damaged axons was observed in the citrate treated animals 2–3 hr post-treatment (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6I</xref>). However, when the same animals were analyzed 24 hr post-treatment, there was a significant increase in the percentage of damaged axons in citrate treated animals compared to untreated controls (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6I</xref>). Note the fact that axons are significantly fragmented or degraded at 24 hr precludes quantification of puncta number and area at this time point. To confirm that citrate-induced damage was dependent on TIR-1 function, we exposed <italic>tir–1(qd4)</italic> mutant animals, which have a null mutation in <italic>tir–1</italic>, to citrate for 24 hr and quantified axon damage (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6J</xref>). We found that 98% of axons remain intact while only 2% were damaged, indicating that citrate exposure induces TIR-1-dependent axonal damage (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6K</xref>). In total, these findings indicate that citrate induces TIR-1 multimerization and axonal degeneration in <italic>C. elegans</italic>.</p><sec id="s2-1"><title>Conclusions</title><p>Our data demonstrate that SARM1 activity is largely dependent on concentration and crowding alone and that as SARM1 multimerizes it becomes more active. Moreover, we show that SARM1 activity is enhanced by a phase transition in vitro. These data are consistent with cellular and in vivo data showing that SARM1 forms puncta and that puncta size increases in response to neuronal injury. These findings are notable because SARM1 was previously thought to function as a dimer. The formation of a higher ordered multimer is, however, consistent with recent structural studies showing that the SAM domains in isolation and in the context of the full-length enzyme form octamers (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Bratkowski et al., 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Gerdts et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Horsefield et al., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Jiang et al., 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">Sporny et al., 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">Summers et al., 2016</xref>). However, the resolution of these structures was not sufficient to determine the active conformation of the TIR domains (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Bratkowski et al., 2020</xref>), and it is unclear whether the TIR domains form dimers, tetramers, octamers, or larger multimers via two or more octameric rings interacting with one another (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Bratkowski et al., 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">Sporny et al., 2020</xref>). Our data suggests that TIR domain multimerization is required to upregulate SARM1 activity.</p><p>Significant cellular and biochemical data supports the notion that the ARM domain interacts with and inhibits the TIR domain. However, mutations that disrupt this interaction cause subtle increases (~2-fold) in SARM1 activity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Bratkowski et al., 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Jiang et al., 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">Sporny et al., 2020</xref>). By contrast, our data demonstrates that SARM1 multimerization increases catalytic efficiency and turnover rate by &gt;2000-fold. Pre-organization of the TIR domains within the context of the octameric structure likely increases the effective concentration of the TIR domain such that multimerization can occur more readily. This conclusion is supported by our finding that our MBP-tagged ceSAMTIR expression construct has a higher basal level of activity that can be further increased by the addition of citrate. Moreover, the data suggest that the ARM domain prevents TIR domain multimerization and limits full activation of the enzyme.</p><p>Our observation that SARM1 becomes progressively more active as it undergoes a phase transition and forms higher ordered multimers, is analogous to other systems including purine biosynthesis where higher ordered oligomers, known as purinosomes, form under certain conditions to enhance purine synthesis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">An et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Chan et al., 2015</xref>). Moreover, SARM1 multimerization is reminiscent of the structures that are formed by inflammasomes and apoptosomes during an immune response or apoptosis. Interestingly, other TIR domain–containing proteins (e.g. MAL) form insoluble fibrils (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">Ve et al., 2017</xref>).</p><p>Supporting the notion that SARM1 multimerizes, we also show that SARM1 forms puncta in cells and that mutations in the BB loop interface (i.e. G601P) is sufficient to disrupt puncta formation. Notably, punctate expression of SARM1 in neurons (both soma and dendrites) has been observed in numerous studies (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Chen et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Osterloh et al., 2012</xref>), further confirming that SARM1 can form higher ordered structures. In the context of a degenerating axon, TIR domain multimerization, could translate into a feed-forward mechanism to induce degeneration. In fact, we demonstrate that increasing TIR–1/SARM1 multimerization in <italic>C. elegans</italic> via citrate treatment is sufficient to induce axonal degeneration. Furthermore, SARM1 protein levels have been documented to increase significantly in response to injury prior to Wallerian degeneration (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Massoll et al., 2013</xref>), which is consistent with our data demonstrating that increasing SARM1 concentration enhances activity and inducing multimerization in vivo causes axonal degeneration. These data are also consistent with a prior report showing that upregulation of SARM1 is sufficient to induce axonal degeneration (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Gerdts et al., 2013</xref>).</p><p>Based on these studies, we propose a model whereby, increasing SARM1 protein levels induces TIR domain multimerization that enhances SARM1 activity via a phase transition and that this process is mimicked by PEG 3350 and sodium citrate (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7</xref>). We hypothesize that the enhanced activity associated with this phase transition is due to the formation of a higher ordered oligomer as we see larger multimers by negative stain, formation of puncta in HEK293T cells, and induction of larger puncta with citrate treatment in <italic>C. elegans</italic>. We expect that the formation of larger puncta facilitates increased inter-TIR domain contacts that allow for enhanced NAD<sup>+</sup> hydrolysis and subsequent axonal degeneration. Similar phase transitions have been observed in multiple signaling pathways. For example, the liquid phase condensation of cyclic GMP–AMP synthase (cGAS) activates innate immune signaling (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Du and Chen, 2018</xref>) and liquid-to-solid phase transitions have been reported for FUS and huntingtin, during the formation of aggregates associated with ALS and Huntington’s disease (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">Patel et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">Peskett et al., 2018</xref>). Given that citrate is a mitochondrial metabolite, it is tempting to speculate that citrate, either from stressed mitochondria or from inhibition of the cytosolic enzyme ATP-citrate lyase, might promote a similar phase transition in vivo. However, the concentrations of citrate in plasma and cerebrospinal fluid are on the order of 0.1–0.4 mM (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Costello and Franklin, 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib41">Westergaard et al., 2017</xref>) versus the mM levels of citrate required to activate SARM1 in vitro. Perhaps in the context of a living cell a lower threshold of citrate could promote this phase transition. Consistent with the latter possibility is our demonstration that lower amounts of citrate promote puncta formation and degeneration in vivo. Further research is needed to fully address this possibility.</p><fig id="fig7" position="float"><label>Figure 7.</label><caption><title>Model for precipitant-mediated enhancement in SARM1 activity and subsequent axonal fragmentation.</title></caption><graphic mime-subtype="tiff" mimetype="image" xlink:href="elife-66694-fig7-v2.tif"/></fig><p>In summary, we show that SARM1 catalytic activity is enhanced by TIR domain multimerization and a phase transition reminiscent of that documented with other neurodegenerative disease-causing proteins. Therefore, inhibiting multimerization or this phase transition could be a target for future therapeutic development for SARM1-associated diseases. In the context of a degenerating axon, we rationalize this phase transition as SARM1 exhibiting gradual NAD<sup>+</sup> hydrolase activity upon initial activation (which is demonstrated by in vitro ARM domain mutations relieving inter-TIR ARM domain contacts) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Bratkowski et al., 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Jiang et al., 2020</xref>) until a critical threshold is reached whereby SARM1 levels increase allowing SARM1 to multimerize and form larger puncta. We anticipate that higher ordered multimerization translates into increased activity and rapid depletion of NAD<sup>+</sup>, which further relieves autoinhibition by NAD<sup>+</sup> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Jiang et al., 2020</xref>) and causes the axon to undergo catastrophic fragmentation and granular disintegration. This could shed light on a built–in protective mechanism to control the toxic effects of SARM1; thus, ensuring the neuron has ample time to circumvent the degenerative path, but when committed to it, degeneration is executed in a positive feed-forward mechanism resulting in abrupt fragmentation and granular disintegration during the latter stages of Wallerian degeneration.</p></sec><sec id="s2-2"><title>Experimental section</title><sec id="s2-2-1"><title>Recombinant protein expression and purification</title><p>A recombinant human SARM1 TIR domain construct was bacterially expressed and purified as previously described (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Loring et al., 2020a</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Loring et al., 2020b</xref>).

Proteins were separated by SDS–PAGE in duplicate and band intensities were quantified with ImageJ and percent precipitation plotted in GraphPad Prism.</p></sec><sec id="s2-24"><title>Creation of mammalian GFP SAMTIR mutants</title><p>A GFP-tagged SARM1 SAMTIR DNA construct (Residues 412–724, Uniprot) in a pcDNA3.1(+) vector was ordered by custom synthesis from GenScript (Appendix 1). Site directed mutagenesis was performed as described above for the TIR domain mutants with the primers listed in Appendix 1. Mutations were confirmed by Genewiz Sanger Sequencing using T7 and BGHR primers.</p></sec><sec id="s2-25"><title>Transient transfection of HEK293T cells</title><p>Mycoplasma negative HEK293T cells purchased from the ATCC were grown to 60% confluency prior to transfection. Cells tested negative for mycoplasma contamination. 10 µg of E642A and E642A/G601P GFP-tagged SAMTIR DNA was diluted into 500 µL of OPTIMEM Reduced serum media. At the same time, 30 µL of lipofectamine 2000 was added to 470 µL of OPTIMEM Reduced serum media and incubated for 3–5 min at RT. Next, the DNA mix was added to the lipofectamine mix and this solution was incubated for 20 min at RT. At which point, 9 mL of OPTIMEM was added to the DNA lipofectamine mix and applied to replace the cell culture media. After a 6 hr incubation at 37°C in a CO<sub>2</sub> incubator, the media was removed and replaced with fresh DMEM media with 10% FBS and 1% Pen/Strep. The cells were incubated for another 18 hr prior to collection for FACS.</p></sec><sec id="s2-26"><title>Fluorescence-activated cell sorting</title><p>E642A and E642A/G601P GFP–SAMTIR cells were collected by washing with PBS, and then adding 3 mL trypsin for 3 min and quenching the reaction with 7 mL DMEM. Cells were resuspended in media and spun down at 3000 x<italic>g</italic> for 3 min to remove the trypsin. Cells were next resuspended in PBS with 1% FBS for FACS. 7AAD (1 µL) was added for a 30 min incubation on ice to stain the dead cells prior to FACS. Cells were sorted by the flow cytometry core at UMass Medical School. Specifically, GFP-positive 7AAD-negative singlet transfected cells were sorted via 85 micron, 47.5 frequency, four–way purity on the BD FACS Aria II Cell Sorter with a purity mask of 32, plates voltage of 4500, and sheath pressure of 45. Cells were collected in PBS and then imaged using Amnis FlowSight Imaging Cytometer.</p></sec><sec id="s2-27"><title>Amnis FlowSight imaging studies</title><p>Images were acquired by the Flow Cytometry Core at UMass Medical School using the Amnis FlowSight Imaging Cytometer (EMD Millipore) with IDEAS software (EMD Millipore). 20,927 images were acquired for E642A and 9895 images were obtained for E642A/G601P GFP–tagged SAMTIR. Channel 1 (430–480 nm) and channel 2 (505–560 nm) images were obtained for bright field and GFP, respectively. All cells were GFP positive and 7AAD negative as expected due to the FACS selection. Gates were applied to prioritize images that were in focus and taken of cells as singlets, and the intensity of these were obtained (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6s2">Figure 6—figure supplement 2</xref>). These cells were analyzed by the IDEAS spot count wizard to bucket the cells according to number of puncta. R1 and R2 designate distinct subpopulations where R1 resembles baseline fluorescence and R2 has higher puncta than baseline.</p></sec><sec id="s2-28"><title><italic>C. elegans</italic> strains and culture</title><p>Unless otherwise noted, all <italic>C. elegans</italic> strains were grown and maintained at 20°C on standard nematode growth media (NGM) plates seeded with <italic>Escherichia coli</italic> OP50 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">Sulston and Hodgkin, 1988</xref>).

Defined intensity threshold values were acquired from control experiments for each fluorescent marker. The ‘analyze particles’ function of Fiji was used to determine the number of puncta and the area of each individual puncta in a given region of interest (ROI) along the ventral nerve cord. Cell bodies were excluded from analysis. The mean number of puncta was determined by dividing the total number of puncta in all ROIs by the total number of ROIs analyzed. The mean puncta area represents the total puncta area divided by the number of puncta. Statistical analysis was performed with GraphPad Prism software.</p></sec><sec id="s2-32"><title>Damage and TIR-1 localization analysis</title><p>Axon integrity was quantified by counting broken, truncated, and absent axons.

revisions, shown below. We also include an acceptance summary that explains what the editors found interesting or important about the work.</p></boxed-text><p><bold>Acceptance summary:</bold></p><p>This manuscript describes an interesting regulatory mechanism that activates SARM1, an enzyme that degrade NAD+ and promote axon degeneration. Previous structural and biochemical studies mostly focus on how SARM1 is auto-inhibited at basal conditions and this manuscript provides evidences supporting that phase transition could promote its activity, thus providing new insights about its in vivo regulatory mechanism. The finding also enables in vitro assays to be carried out more easily and thus could facilitate the development of small molecule modulators of SARM1 for therapeutics purposes.</p><p><bold>Decision letter after peer review:</bold></p><p>Thank you for submitting your article &quot;A Phase Transition Enhances the Catalytic Activity of SARM1&quot; for consideration by <italic>eLife</italic>. Your article has been reviewed by 3 peer reviewers, including Hening Lin as the Reviewing Editor and Reviewer #1, and the evaluation has been overseen by Cynthia Wolberger as the Senior Editor. The following individual involved in review of your submission has agreed to reveal their identity: Charlie Brenner (Reviewer #2).</p><p>The reviewers have discussed their reviews with one another, and the Reviewing Editor has drafted this to help you prepare a revised submission.</p><p>Essential revisions:</p><p>1) Test the phase transition behavior of full length SARM1 (could be either human or worm SARM1) to see whether the phase transition and activity enhancement also happen to full length SARM1. If the result is positive, it will further enhance the manuscript. If the result is negative, please tone down the claim and discuss this accordingly.</p><p><italic>Reviewer #1 (Recommendations for the authors):</italic></p><p>A few key experiments, including the in vitro activation by PEG or citrate, and the puncta formation in HEK293T cells, should be replicated using the full length SARM1. If similar results are obtained with the full length SARM1, the conclusion will be more strongly supported and further enhance the connection to physiology/pathophysiology. Given that the in vivo data is obtained using <italic>C. elegans</italic>, the <italic>C. elegans</italic> full length SARM1 could be used for such study.</p><p>The observation that citrate promotes axon degeneration in <italic>C. elegans</italic> is interesting. The manuscript may use a little more discussion on this topic. For example, it would be interesting to discuss whether there are connections between citrate and axon degermation reported in the literature and whether citrate could be a physiological/pathophysiological trigger for axon degeneration in mammals.</p><p><italic>Reviewer #3 (Recommendations for the authors):</italic></p><p>This study of SARM1 builds on past information and extends it into a more complete picture of the conversion between inactive and active enzyme forms. A biological advance comes from the discovery that citrate can activate the enzyme. Citrate is then used in <italic>C. elegans</italic> to cause in vivo activation of the enzyme with subsequent neuronal damage. There is much to appreciate in this work as it advances the understanding of SARM1 activity and its role in neuronal degradation. There are some questions and areas of improvements to be made, summarized in the comments below. Once these are addressed, the manuscript should be published.</p><p>An excellent TOC figure, it is worth more than the proverbial 1000 words.</p><p>The title needs to include the catalytic function, perhaps &quot;A Phase Transition Enhances the Catalytic Activity of SARM1, an NAD+ glycohydolase'.</p><p>Figure 1 legend should explain proposed domain function.</p><p>Table 1 and the description &quot;As before, we found that ZnCl2 inhibits SARM1 noncompetitively with a Ki value of 1.0 ± 0.1 μM.&quot; Do not appear to match.</p><p>&quot;we found that berberine chloride inhibits SARM1 noncompetitively in the presence of PEG 3350 with a Ki value of 120 ± 10 μM.&quot; What is it? A Zn-chelator? Why is it being compared to Zn?</p><p>Throughout, the units of uM/sec are ambiguous without knowing the enzyme concentration, requiring a search through the methods/legends. In contrast a rate in the traditional enzymatic units of turnovers / sec (simply s<sup>-1</sup>) seem more descriptive and are used in several critical places, eg. Figure 3 l. The reviewer is reluctant to ask the authors to make all the changes, but include as a note for future reports.</p><p>Even in its most active form SARM1 has a k<sub>cat</sub>/K<sub>m</sub> around 103 s<sup>-1</sup>M<sup>-1</sup>s<sup>-1</sup>, making it a sleepy enzyme, the authors should compare with other known NAD glycohydrolases, and comment as to this difference and how much SARM1 there is in neuronal bodies (300 nM is cited) relative to an ability to deplete NAD pools.</p><p>“…cADPR inhibits SARM1 in the presence of PEG with an IC<sub>50</sub> of 100 ± 10 μM and a competitive inhibition pattern…” What is the mechanism? If both cADPR and ADPR are competitive, it supports a rapid-equilibrium random release of products.</p><p>The statement &quot;Although the percentage of damaged axons in the citrate treated animals 2-3 h post-treatment is higher than untreated controls the data are not significant (Figure 6I).&quot; is an obvious logical error. Not significant means not significant and the statement should be that there is no significant change in damaged axons at 2-3 h.</p><p>The studies with <italic>C. elegans</italic>, citrate activation and axonal damage are a valuable addition. I was waiting for the NAD analysis to follow… – can the authors measure NAD in control vs untreated C.e.?</p><p>A comment needs to address the 500 mM citrate effects on SARM1 versus the 8 mM citrate effect on the <italic>C. elegans</italic> homologue of SARM1.</p></body></sub-article><sub-article article-type="reply" id="sa2"><front-stub><article-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.66694.sa2</article-id><title-group><article-title>Author response</article-title></title-group></front-stub><body><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Essential revisions:</p><p>1) Test the phase transition behavior of full length SARM1 (could be either human or worm SARM1) to see whether the phase transition and activity enhancement also happen to full length SARM1.

To address this issue, we used TIR-1, the <italic>Caenorhabditis elegans</italic> ortholog of SARM1. Like SARM1, TIR-1 also possesses NAD<sup>+</sup> hydrolase activity. Notably, <italic>C. elegans</italic> encodes several TIR-1 splice variants including TIR-1b and TIR-1d which lack the ARM domain (Figure S5A ) but contain the tandem SAM domains essential for octamer formation. Since TIR-1b was used in our in vivo studies, we expressed and purified an MBP tagged ceSAMTIR expression construct as a mimic of TIR-1b and evaluated whether citrate activates this construct. As a control, we also evaluated the effect of citrate on the <italic>C. elegans</italic> TIR domain (ceTIR). Like the human TIR domain, the NAD<sup>+</sup> hydrolase activity of both ceTIR and ceSAMTIR was greater in citrate, where ceTIR and ceSAMTIR activity were enhanced 22-fold and 1.4-fold respectively (Figure S5B). While citrate does not activate the ceSAMTIR construct to the same extent as the ceTIR domain alone, mutations that disrupt the TIR–ARM interface or deletion of the ARM domain activate SARM1 to a similar extent (i.e., 1.8– 2.4–fold) (Jiang et al., 2020).</p><p>Having demonstrated that ceSAMTIR activity is enhanced in citrate, we next sought to determine whether ceSAMTIR undergoes a phase transition. To do this, we incubated ceSAMTIR with increasing concentrations of citrate, centrifuged the samples, removed the soluble fraction, and resuspended the insoluble pelleted fraction. All fractions were analyzed by SDS-PAGE for the presence of ceSAMTIR. At citrate concentrations 250 mM and below, ceSAMTIR was predominantly located in the supernatant. By contrast, at citrate concentrations of 500 mM and above, the protein was increasingly found in the pellet, such that at 1000 mM citrate, ceSAMTIR was primarily located in the pellet.</p><p>Moreover, enzymatic activity in the fractions correlated with the location of ceSAMTIR (Figure S5C). These data are consistent with the hypothesis that longer versions of SARM1/TIR-1 also undergo a phase transition.</p><p>These findings have been included in the manuscript. The additional text reads:</p><p>“To this end, we opted to study the SARM1 orthologue, TIR–1 in the GABA motor nervous system of <italic>C. elegans</italic>. <italic>C. elegans</italic> encodes several TIR-1 splice variants including TIR-1b and TIR-1d which lack the ARM domain (Figure S5A ), but contain the tandem SAM domains essential for octamer formation. […] These data are consistent with the hypothesis that longer versions of SARM1/TIR-1 also undergo a phase transition that correlates with enzyme activation.”</p><p>We also edited the conclusions section by modifying an existing paragraph.</p><p>“Significant cellular and biochemical data supports the notion that the ARM domain interacts with and inhibits the TIR domain. […] Moreover, the data suggest that the ARM domain prevents TIR domain multimerization and limits full activation of the enzyme.”</p><p>Finally, we did tone down our final conclusions by replacing ‘…translates into an exponential increase in activity…’ to ‘…translates into increased activity …’</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Reviewer #1 (Recommendations for the authors):</p><p>A few key experiments, including the in vitro activation by PEG or citrate, and the puncta formation in HEK293T cells, should be replicated using the full length SARM1. If similar results are obtained with the full length SARM1, the conclusion will be more strongly supported and further enhance the connection to physiology/pathophysiology. Given that the in vivo data is obtained using <italic>C. elegans</italic>, the <italic>C. elegans</italic> full length SARM1 could be used for such study.</p></disp-quote><p>As described above in our response to essential revisions, we have demonstrated that citrate also activates TIR1b, a <italic>C. elegans</italic> isoform of SARM1 (see above). We believe that the puncta formation studies in HEK293T cells are beyond the scope of the manuscript, especially since we showed that puncta formation occurs in vivo. Additionally, constructs encoding full length human SARM1 are unstable due to their high GC content and this issue has presented a technical challenge to completing those studies. As such, we elected to proceed without those studies.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>The observation that citrate promotes axon degeneration in C. elegans is interesting. The manuscript may use a little more discussion on this topic. For example, it would be interesting to discuss whether there are connections between citrate and axon degermation reported in the literature and whether citrate could be a physiological/pathophysiological trigger for axon degeneration in mammals.</p></disp-quote><p>We have added additional discussion of this phenomenon to the discussion. Reviewers 2 and 3 made a similar request. The additional text reads:</p><p><bold>“</bold>Given that citrate is a mitochondrial metabolite, it is tempting to speculate that citrate, either from stressed mitochondria or from inhibition of the cytosolic enzyme ATP-citrate lyase, might promote a similar phase transition in vivo. […] Further research is needed to fully address this possibility.”</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Reviewer #3 (Recommendations for the authors):</p><p>This study of SARM1 builds on past information and extends it into a more complete picture of the conversion between inactive and active enzyme forms. A biological advance comes from the discovery that citrate can activate the enzyme. Citrate is then used in C. elegans to cause in vivo activation of the enzyme with subsequent neuronal damage. There is much to appreciate in this work as it advances the understanding of SARM1 activity and its role in neuronal degradation. There are some questions and areas of improvements to be made, summarized in the comments below. Once these are addressed, the manuscript should be published.</p><p>An excellent TOC figure, it is worth more than the proverbial 1000 words.</p></disp-quote><p>We thank the reviewer for their kind words.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>The title needs to include the catalytic function, perhaps &quot;A Phase Transition Enhances the Catalytic Activity of SARM1, an NAD+ glycohydolase'.</p></disp-quote><p>We have changed the title to: “A Phase Transition Enhances the Catalytic Activity of SARM1, an NAD+ glycohydrolase involved in neurodegeneration”.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Figure 1 legend should explain proposed domain function.</p></disp-quote><p>We have modified the figure legend as requested. It now reads:</p><p>“Figure 1. SARM1 Reaction and Domain Structure. […] SARM1 consists of three domains: an autoinhibitory HEAT/armadillo (ARM) domain, two tandem sterile α motif (SAM) domains that promote octamerization, and a C–terminal toll interleukin receptor (TIR) domain that catalyzes NAD<sup>+</sup> hydrolysis.”</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Table 1 and the description &quot;As before, we found that ZnCl2 inhibits SARM1 noncompetitively with a Ki value of 1.0 ± 0.1 μM.&quot; Do not appear to match.</p><p>&quot;we found that berberine chloride inhibits SARM1 noncompetitively in the presence of PEG 3350 with a Ki value of 120 ± 10 μM.&quot; What is it? A Zn-chelator? Why is it being compared to Zn?</p></disp-quote><p>We apologize for the confusion. ZnCl2 and Berberine chloride are two separate inhibitors that were discovered by the Thompson lab. We evaluated their IC<sub>50</sub> and mechanism of inhibition in the presence of PEG and compared those to previously established values obtained from lysates to establish that PEG was not influencing their inhibition properties, i.e. potency and mechanism of inhibition. We additionally performed similar experiments with pure protein in absence of PEG. We hope that this information clarifies the issue for the reviewer. To avoid confusion for other readers, we have noted in the manuscript that berberine chloride is a second independent inhibitor. The modified text reads:</p><p><bold>“</bold>For a secondary confirmation that PEG does not impact the in vitro properties of SARM1, we tested a different inhibitor, berberine chloride that was previously identified from a high throughput screen (Loring et al., 2020b).”</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Throughout, the units of uM/sec are ambiguous without knowing the enzyme concentration, requiring a search through the methods/legends. In contrast a rate in the traditional enzymatic units of turnovers / sec (simply s<sup>-1</sup>) seem more descriptive and are used in several critical places, eg. Figure 3 l. The reviewer is reluctant to ask the authors to make all the changes, but include as a note for future reports.</p></disp-quote><p>We thank the reviewer for the suggestion and will make use v/[E] values in future reports.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Even in its most active form SARM1 has a k<sub>cat</sub>/K<sub>m</sub> around 103 s<sup>-1</sup>M<sup>-1</sup>s<sup>-1</sup>, making it a sleepy enzyme, the authors should compare with other known NAD glycohydrolases, and comment as to this difference and how much SARM1 there is in neuronal bodies (300 nM is cited) relative to an ability to deplete NAD pools.</p></disp-quote><p>We thank the reviewer for the suggestion and agree that the k<sub>cat</sub>/K<sub>m</sub> values obtained for SARM1 (~2000 s<sup>-1</sup>M<sup>-1</sup>s<sup>-1</sup>) are not particularly robust, however, they are inline with other eukaryotic enzymes that we have studied including the protein arginine deiminases, protein arginine methyltransferases, and nicotinamide N-methyltransferase <sup>5-8</sup>. Nonetheless, we have noted this issue in the results and suggested that the slow kinetics correlates with the fact that degeneration occurs on the hour time scale. Here is the additional text:</p><p>“While the <italic>k</italic><sub>cat</sub>/<italic>K</italic><sub>m</sub> values obtained for SARM1 (~2000 s<sup>-1</sup>M<sup>-1</sup>s<sup>-1</sup>) are not particularly robust, they are in-line with other eukaryotic enzymes that we have studied e.g., the protein arginine deiminases, protein arginine methyltransferases, and nicotinamide Nmethyltransferase (Knuckley et al., 2007; Knuckley et al., 2010; Loring and Thompson, 2018; Osborne et al., 2007), and the slow kinetics likely relate to the fact that degeneration occurs on the hour time scale (Mack et al., 2001; Osterloh et al., 2012).”</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>“…cADPR inhibits SARM1 in the presence of PEG with an IC<sub>50</sub> of 100 ± 10 μM and a competitive inhibition pattern…” What is the mechanism? If both cADPR and ADPR are competitive, it supports a rapid-equilibrium random release of products.</p></disp-quote><p>Respectfully, we previously showed that SARM1 hydrolyzes NAD+ via an ordered uni-bi reaction in which nicotinamide is released prior to ADPR <sup>4</sup>. Since ADPR is released last, regenerating the free enzyme, competitive inhibition with respect to NAD+ is expected. cADPR is also expected to act as a competitive inhibitor because cADPR is a minor alternative product and not an obligate intermediate as demonstrated by our current product specificity ratio data and single turnover data. Moreover, this conclusion is consistent with our prior demonstration that ENAD is efficiently hydrolyzed by SARM1; the etheno bridge in ENAD blocks the N1 position, which was previously shown to be the site of cyclization <sup>4</sup>. We hope that are explanation clarifies the issue for the reviewer.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>The statement &quot;Although the percentage of damaged axons in the citrate treated animals 2-3 h post-treatment is higher than untreated controls the data are not significant (Figure 6I).&quot; is an obvious logical error. Not significant means not significant and the statement should be that there is no significant change in damaged axons at 2-3 h.</p></disp-quote><p>We apologize for the error. We have modified the sentence so that it now reads: “No significant change in the percentage of damaged axons was observed in the citrate treated animals 2–3 h post–treatment (Figure 6I).</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>The studies with C. elegans, citrate activation and axonal damage are a valuable addition.
