involves their increased electrotonic attenuation at distal dendrites, which can be counterbalanced by the increased synaptic receptor density. However, during network activity, the influence of individual synapses depends on their release fidelity, the dendritic distribution of which remains poorly understood. Here, we employed classical optical quantal analyses and a genetically encoded optical glutamate sensor in acute hippocampal slices of rats and mice to monitor glutamate release at CA3-CA1 synapses. We find that their release probability increases with greater distances from the soma. Similar-fidelity synapses tend to group together, whereas release probability shows no trends regarding the branch ends. Simulations with a realistic CA1 pyramidal cell hosting stochastic synapses suggest that the observed trends boost signal transfer fidelity, particularly at higher input frequencies. Because high-frequency bursting has been associated with learning, the release probability pattern we have found may play a key role in memory trace formation.</p></abstract><kwd-group kwd-group-type="author-keywords"><kwd>hippocampus</kwd><kwd>synaptic terminals</kwd><kwd>dendritic spines</kwd><kwd>neurotransmitter release</kwd><kwd>release probability</kwd><kwd>dendritic integration</kwd></kwd-group><kwd-group kwd-group-type="research-organism"><title>Research organism</title><kwd>Mouse</kwd><kwd>Rat</kwd></kwd-group><funding-group><award-group id="fund1"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100004440</institution-id><institution>Wellcome Trust</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>212251_Z_18_Z</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Rusakov</surname><given-names>Dmitri A</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund2"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100000781</institution-id><institution>European Research Council</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>323113</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Rusakov</surname><given-names>Dmitri A</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund3"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100000780</institution-id><institution>European Commission</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>857562</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Rusakov</surname><given-names>Dmitri A</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><funding-statement>The funders had no role in study design, data collection and interpretation, or the decision to submit the work for publication.</funding-statement></funding-group><custom-meta-group><custom-meta specific-use="meta-only"><meta-name>Author impact statement</meta-name><meta-value>Excitatory synapses that occur further away from the postsynaptic cell soma exhibit greater neurotransmitter release probability, which appears to improve signal transfer fidelity for high-frequency afferent firing.</meta-value></custom-meta></custom-meta-group></article-meta></front><body><sec id="s1" sec-type="intro"><title>Introduction</title><p>Information processing in brain circuits relies on dendritic integration of excitatory inputs that occur at varied distances from the soma. Whilst the cable impedance of dendrites attenuates electric signals arriving from distal synapses, some nerve cells appear well equipped to counter this trend. In hippocampal CA1 pyramidal neurons, synaptic receptor numbers increase monotonically with the synapse-soma distance (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Andrasfalvy and Magee, 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">Nicholson et al., 2006</xref>). This, combined with the regenerative properties of local ion channels (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Cash and Yuste, 1999</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Magee, 1999</xref>), can provide efficient, relatively homogeneous summation of synaptic inputs across the dendritic tree of these cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Cash and Yuste, 1999</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Magee, 2000</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Magee and Cook, 2000</xref>). In contrast, distal synapses on cortical L5 pyramidal neurons appear relatively ineffective in somatic excitation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib45">Williams and Stuart, 2002</xref>). A combination of 3D electron microscopy with biophysical modelling of CA1 pyramidal cells has also argued that the greater occurrence of excitatory synapses towards the dendritic branch origin helps to normalise input efficacy along the dendrites (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Katz et al., 2009</xref>). However, it remains largely unknown whether the other fundamental synaptic property, neurotransmitter release probability (P<sub>r</sub>) remains constant along the dendrites. Because P<sub>r</sub> defines how much information synaptic connections transmit over time (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib46">Zador, 1998</xref>), its distribution pattern is critical to the rules of dendritic input integration.</p><p>A recent elegant study has combined electron microscopy with extracellular (paired-pulse) afferent activation of multiple synapses in basal dendrites of CA1 pyramidal cells, to find the average P<sub>r</sub> values decreasing towards the cell periphery (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Grillo et al., 2018</xref>). Thus, a few proximal connections appear to have a greater impact on the cell output than more numerous synapses occurring distally. This observation raised the question of the synaptic connectome efficiency, suggesting that, during continued afferent spiking, distal inputs are weakened. Although highly supra-linear local events, such as dendritic spikes could, in principle, compensate for this trend (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Larkum and Nevian, 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Branco and Häusser, 2009</xref>), how prevalent such events are remains debatable. Furthermore, if P<sub>r</sub> tends to decrease towards more distal apical dendrites in CA1 pyramidal cells, the suggested input summation rules in these cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Magee, 2000</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Magee and Cook, 2000</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Branco and Häusser, 2011</xref>), and at least in some other principal neurons (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Araya et al., 2006</xref>), would be broken during sustained network activity.</p><p>Methodologically, paired-pulse recordings of multi-synaptic responses (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Grillo et al., 2018</xref>), while revealing the trend, do not provide direct readout of either P<sub>r</sub>, paired-pulse ratios (PPRs), or the P<sub>r</sub> distribution among individual connections. This makes it difficult to evaluate how these properties of P<sub>r</sub> affect dendritic integration. To address these challenges, here we monitored P<sub>r</sub> in individual CA3-CA1 synapses, by systematically employing single-synapse optical quantal analyses (OQA) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">Oertner et al., 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Emptage et al., 2003</xref>), based on Ca<sup>2+</sup> imaging in individual dendritic spines, as established previously (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib42">Sylantyev et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Boddum et al., 2016</xref>). In a complementary approach, we employed the genetically encoded optical glutamate sensor iGluSnFR, as established earlier (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Jensen et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Jensen et al., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Henneberger et al., 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Kopach et al., 2020</xref>), to document a spatial trend of P<sub>r</sub> values across the <italic>s. radiatrum</italic>. Exploring the results with a realistic biophysical model of the CA1 pyramidal cell (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">Migliore et al., 1999</xref>) equipped with multiple stochastic synaptic inputs, revealed how the observed trends in the P<sub>r</sub> pattern along dendrites could affect synaptic input integration in CA1 pyramidal cells.</p></sec><sec id="s2" sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><sec id="s2-1"><title>Monitoring release probability with optical quantal analysis</title><p>We used 300–350 µm transverse hippocampal slices of 3- to 4-week-old rats (Materials and methods). First, we held CA1 pyramidal cells in whole-cell (V<sub>m</sub> = −65 mV) and dialysed them with the red morphological tracer Alexa Fluor 594 (50 µM) and Ca<sup>2+</sup>-sensitive indicators as detailed in Materials and methods and described previously (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib42">Sylantyev et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib47">Zheng et al., 2015</xref>). We visualised cell morphology with two-photon excitation (λ<sub>x</sub><sup>2p </sup>= 800 nm), and placed the extracellular stimulating pipette in the 10–20 µm proximity of apical dendrites (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1A</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1A</xref>). The system was focused on individual dendritic spines that responded to paired-pulse stimuli (50 ms apart) with localised Ca<sup>2+</sup> transients in a stochastic manner (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1B</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1B</xref>). Because individual dendritic spines of CA1 pyramidal cells host almost exclusively only one CA3-CA1 synapse (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Harris and Stevens, 1989</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Bloss et al., 2018</xref>), the first-pulse Ca<sup>2+</sup> signal success counts over 14–30 trials provided direct readout of P<sub>r</sub> at individual synapses (P1 in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1B</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1C</xref>), as we showed earlier (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib42">Sylantyev et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Boddum et al., 2016</xref>). In these tests, the amplitudes of successful first-pulse release signals were consistently above two standard deviations of the average signal during release failures (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1D</xref>), enabling us to readily calculate P<sub>r</sub> = P1. The second-pulse release probability was estimated using two complementary methods (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2B</xref>): one in which all trials were assessed for 1st and 2nd release successes and failures (P2), and one in which trials with the first successful response were ignored (P2*). The latter method eliminates false-positive detection of the second-pulse success, at the expense of reduced trial numbers. The curvilinear distance from the spine of interest to the cell soma was subsequently recorded (Materials and methods).</p><fig-group><fig id="fig1" position="float"><label>Figure 1.</label><caption><title>Optical quantal analysis at individual CA3-CA1 synapses reports higher release probability towards distant dendrites.</title><p>(<bold>A</bold>) CA1 pyramidal cell held in whole-cell mode (acute hippocampal slice), dialysed with 50 µM AF 594 and 300 µM Fluo-8 (75 µm z-stack average, <italic>λ</italic><sub>x</sub><sup>2p</sup> = 800 nm; AF 594 channel).

The linear regression for the data suggested a rise in average P<sub>r</sub> from ~0.2 at 50 µm to ~0.5 at 300 µm (range 0.05–0.7; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1C</xref>). Over this distance range, the PPR of release probabilities decreased, on average, from ~3 to ~1.1, for either P2 or P2* counts (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1D–E</xref>; experiments with no reliable 2nd response detection and no 'failure-success' responses were not included). While these relationships show relatively low values of correlation coefficient, the interpretation of Pearson's r that is commonly adopted for a specimen-centred design is irrelevant in the present context (see Discussion).</p><p>There observations appear at variance with an elegant earlier report which detected no distance-dependent P<sub>r</sub> trends along apical dendrites of CA1 pyramidal cells, based on the use-dependent blockade of NMDARs by MK801 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib40">Smith et al., 2003</xref>). However, the MK801-based approach is sensitive to local glutamate spillover (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">Scimemi et al., 2004</xref>) and, in that case, involved a Mg<sup>2+</sup>-free solution, both of which could mask the P<sub>r</sub> trend. Intriguingly, that study documented 15–50% lower average PPR values in distal compared to proximal synapses, consistently over 25–200 ms paired-pulse intervals, albeit without reaching statistical significance in a six-cell sample (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib40">Smith et al., 2003</xref>).</p><p>The centrifugal trend in P<sub>r</sub> values remained significant when the distance was measured from the primary apical dendrites (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2A</xref>), suggesting that this trend applies to oblique branches rather than simply reflecting a position along the main dendrite. Interestingly, the analysis of P<sub>r</sub> values recorded in pairs of synapses located on the same dendrite has revealed that the connections with similar P<sub>r</sub> tend to occur close to one another (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2B</xref>). Thus, 'homogenisation' of P<sub>r</sub> among local synapses, which was detected previously in cultured neurons (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Branco et al., 2008</xref>), is likely to occur in ex vivo brain tissue. At the same time, we found no trends in P<sub>r</sub> values with respect to the synapse position relative to the local dendrite branching point (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2C</xref>; the centrifugal P<sub>r</sub> trend in these data does not reach statistical significance because branch length is much smaller than the overall dendritic length, thus providing much reduced statistical power). The prevalence of larger, more densely packed spines near the dendritic branch origins was earlier reported to reflect normalisation of synaptic signals integrated at the soma (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Katz et al., 2009</xref>). In this context, no gradient in P<sub>r</sub> values within a branch (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2C</xref>) suggests that the above normalisation should still be valid during sustained afferent activity.</p><p>Because higher P<sub>r</sub> are normally associated with lower PPRs (as in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1D</xref>), the probability of both stimuli initiating successful release showed only a barely detectable increase with the spine-soma distance (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2D</xref>), whereas the second-release P<sub>r</sub> values were evenly spread along the dendrites (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s1">Figure 2—figure supplement 1A</xref>). However, the longitudinal density of optically identifiable dendritic spines increased towards distal dendrites (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2E</xref>), also showing positive correlation with the P<sub>r</sub> (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2F</xref>), but no correlation with the PPR values (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s1">Figure 2—figure supplement 1B</xref>).</p></sec><sec id="s2-2"><title>Monitoring glutamate release at CA3-CA1 synapses with an optical sensor</title><p>We have previously shown (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Jensen et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Jensen et al., 2019</xref>) that the patterns of release probability at CA3-CA1 synapses can be successfully gauged by monitoring presynaptic glutamate release with the genetically encoded optical sensor iGluSnFR (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">Marvin et al., 2018</xref>).

This has a simple explanation. In the hippocampal neuropil, released glutamate molecules can travel for up to ~2 μm from the synapse (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Armbruster et al., 2020</xref>), not necessarily entering other synaptic clefts (see Discussion). Given the density of glutamatergic connections in area CA1 of ~2.0 μm<sup>−2</sup> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">Rusakov and Kullmann, 1998</xref>), individual synapses have &gt;60 neighbours within the 2 μm proximity (i.e. within the spherical volume of ~33 μm<sup>3</sup>). Furthermore, two-photon excitation imaging collects emission signal integrated over a ~ 1-μm-thick focal plane. Thus, extracellular stimulation is likely to generate an iGluSnFR fluorescence transient due to glutamate spillover even if only a small fraction of local axons gets excited. This implies that the iGluSnFR signals reported here reflect release activity of several local synapses, which makes this approach suitable for PPR measurements rather than for direct P<sub>r</sub> estimates.</p><p>Measuring the amplitudes of paired-pulse iGluSnFR signal transients thus revealed a clear trend towards lower PPR, hence higher P<sub>r</sub> values, with greater distances from the <italic>s. pyramidale</italic> (PPR mean ± SEM: 1.49 ± 0.01, n = 33; regression at p&lt;0.001; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3C</xref>). This observation was qualitatively consistent with the PPR data obtained with the OQA of Ca<sup>2+</sup> signals (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1D-E</xref>) . In contrast, the first iGluSnFR response amplitude on its own showed no distance dependence (<italic>ΔF/F</italic><sub>0,</sub> mean ± SEM: 37 ± 0.5%; range 0.18–0.81; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3D</xref>). The latter was expected because, in addition to P<sub>r</sub> per se, the iGluSnFR signal amplitude depends on several poorly controlled local concomitants, such as the degree of glutamate spillover (which in turn depends on the local expression of iGluSnFR and glutamate transporters) and/or density of activated axons.</p><p>In a complementary approach, we recorded iGluSnFR responses to a short burst of five afferent stimuli (at 20 Hz), in an attempt to relate their use-dependent release properties to their location with respect to the <italic>s. pyramidale</italic>.

While such recordings have relatively low temporal resolution, the underlying (fast) fluorescence kinetics could be reconstructed using a straightforward fitting procedure (Materials and methods; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s1">Figure 3—figure supplement 1B</xref>).

Therefore, in the second test, we simulated a Poisson process of stochastic synaptic discharges, across the physiological range of frequencies, and monitored the postsynaptic cell output. Experimental attempts to explore stochastic input to principal neurons have often employed synchronous (extracellular) activation of multiple afferent fibres, which is unlikely to happen in an intact brain where individual inputs can generate independent spike series. Thus, relatively intense synaptic input activity seen in pyramidal cells in vivo could correspond to a relatively low spiking frequency at the individual multiple afferents converging onto these cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Bähner et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Kowalski et al., 2016</xref>). These considerations suggest that short-term plasticity, if any, of intense synaptic input is actually driven mainly by the evolution of P<sub>r</sub> values over low or moderate spiking frequencies at individual axons.</p><p>To understand whether and how the distance dependence of P<sub>r</sub> influences spiking output of the postsynaptic pyramidal cell, we first compared the case of uniform P<sub>r</sub> values (P<sub>r</sub> = 0.36), with that of the P<sub>r</sub> trend (the spine density trend was ignored as it had a negligible effect on EPSCs; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4B</xref>). The outcome shows that having the P<sub>r</sub> trend provides a clear advantage for signal transfer fidelity, which is particularly prominent at higher input frequencies (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4C</xref>). However, in these simulations we assumed no use-dependent changes in the transmission efficacy as set by P<sub>r</sub>. In fact, a recent study of the CA3-CA1 circuitry has established the time-dependent degree of (presynaptic) short-term plasticity (STP) during afferent bursts, over a wide range of firing frequencies (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Mukunda and Narayanan, 2017</xref>). In brief, during repetitive presynaptic activity, P<sub>r</sub> undergoes prominent facilitation and depression within the first 2–4 discharges, followed by a near-constant P<sub>r</sub> value that depends on the average input frequency (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Mukunda and Narayanan, 2017</xref>). We have incorporated this STP algorithm (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s1">Figure 4—figure supplement 1C</xref>) and successfully validated it in our model by comparing simulated and recorded outcomes of the fixed-frequency afferent bursts (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s1">Figure 4—figure supplement 1D–F</xref>). Equipped with this STP mechanism, we generated Poisson-process afferent input in our model and found, once again, that the P<sub>r</sub> trend improves signal transfer, with the effect monotonically increasing with higher frequencies of afferent firing (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4D</xref>).</p></sec></sec><sec id="s3" sec-type="discussion"><title>Discussion</title><p>The way information is handled and stored by brain circuits depends largely on the rules of synaptic signal integration by principal neurons. Passive electric properties of neuronal dendrites impose distance-dependent attenuation of synaptic receptor current. Thus, distal synapses should have a progressively weaker influence on somatic spike generation. If true, this would mean that neurons with large dendritic trees possess a highly inefficient synaptic connectome. However, studies in hippocampal CA1 pyramidal cells have found that synaptic receptor numbers increase with the synapse-soma distance (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Andrasfalvy and Magee, 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">Nicholson et al., 2006</xref>) and that ion channel properties at distal dendrites enable local regenerative events (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Cash and Yuste, 1999</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Magee, 1999</xref>). These features seem to underpin near-linear summation of synaptic inputs across the entire tree (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Cash and Yuste, 1999</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Magee, 2000</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Magee and Cook, 2000</xref>), thus rescuing the efficiency of dendritic signal integration. However, equal contribution of individual axo-dendritic synapses to somatic signal assumes that their average discharge rates are similar. This in turn directly depends on P<sub>r</sub> and its use-dependent plasticity at individual synapses (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib45">Williams and Stuart, 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib44">Williams and Atkinson, 2007</xref>). It was therefore a surprising discovery that the P<sub>r</sub> values at the basal dendrites of CA1 pyramidal cells showed a centrifugal decrease, at least in conditions of synchronous, multi-synaptic paired-pulse stimuli (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Grillo et al., 2018</xref>). If common, this trend, again, would question the efficiency of synaptic connectome: it seems wasteful to make so many distal synaptic connections that have so little impact.</p><sec id="s3-1"><title>Assessing P<sub>r</sub> using optical quantal analysis and paired-pulse ratios</title><p>Here, we used OQAs to measure P<sub>r</sub> at individual synapses in apical dendrites of CA1 pyramidal cells and found the opposite: P<sub>r</sub> values were increasing with the synapse-soma distance along the dendrites. There are certain advantages of the OQA over electrophysiological PPR measurements. Firstly, OQA requires only single-pulse stimulation and establishes absolute, rather than relative, P<sub>r</sub> values and their distribution pattern along the dendrites. Secondly, OQA deals with confirmed afferent activation of individual synapses and thus avoids the potential dependence between excitability of an axon and P<sub>r</sub> value at its synapses, which would be masked in multiple-fibre stimulation. Thirdly, intrinsic differences in the short-term plasticity kinetics among different synaptic populations may contribute to the variation in PPRs. As for the P<sub>r</sub> assessment based on the use-dependent NMDA receptor blocker MK-801, the progressive blockade of the NMDAR current may involve a degree of local inter-synaptic NMDAR activation via glutamate spillover (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">Scimemi et al., 2004</xref>). The latter should have a much smaller effect on the postsynaptic optical Ca<sup>2+</sup> signal which, classically, displays S-shape sensitivity to the underlying NMDAR current, so, it is virtually insensitive to small current increments near the bottom (release failure) and near the top (release success) of the scale. Indeed, multiple studies involving classical OQA or single-synapse LTP induction have indicated that, under suitable protocols, postsynaptic Ca<sup>2+</sup> signals elicited either by local afferent stimuli or by glutamate uncaging, do not spread to neighbouring spines (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">Oertner et al., 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Emptage et al., 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Boddum et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Henneberger et al., 2020</xref>).</p><p>The technically strenuous OQA has its own limitations, of which the main one is the low signal-to-noise ratio, at least at some connections. In addition, the high-affinity (slowly unbinding) Ca<sup>2+</sup> indicators required to detect dendritic spine signals tend to saturate rapidly, thus preventing reliable P<sub>r</sub> readout for more than ~2 successive stimuli. We therefore, firstly, focused on synapses that showed a clear distinction between failures and successes (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1B</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1C,D</xref>), noting that this sampling still safely included the P<sub>r</sub> range from 0.1 to 0.9 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1D</xref>). Secondly, we used two PPR readouts as a gauge for P<sub>r</sub> variations, with the adjusted PPR measure avoiding any uncertainty about second-pulse detection of successes or failures (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1E</xref>). Both PPR measures pointed to a clear centrifugal trend for P<sub>r</sub> values (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1D–E</xref>).</p><p>To further address a potential bias in selecting dendritic spines, we employed an alternative experimental design, in which P<sub>r</sub> trends were assessed in the bulk of synapses in area CA1 by imaging evoked glutamate release with the genetically encoded optical sensor iGluSnFR. Similar to the earlier method (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Grillo et al., 2018</xref>), we used PPR values to assess position-dependent variations in P<sub>r</sub>. While the earlier method referred to the position of the stimulation electrode with respect to the patched postsynaptic cell morphology, the present approach provided an exact spatial reference to the site of glutamate release in the <italic>s. radiatum</italic>. As explained in the Results, iGluSnFR signals registered here under extracellular stimuli are most likely to reflect release of glutamate from several local synapses. This makes such an approach suitable for PPR measurements rather than for direct P<sub>r</sub> estimates. The outcome of these experiments was consistent with the OQA data.</p><p>In the P<sub>r</sub>-related data scatters presented here, Pearson's correlation r was relatively low (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figures 1</xref>–<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">2</xref>). Indeed, the unexplained variance in the scatters, which is (1−r<sup>2</sup>), reflects large biological variability of P<sub>r</sub> among synapses, as expected. Classically, low Pearson's r between variables <italic>x</italic> and <italic>y</italic> is interpreted as 'weak' correlation, because in such cases sampling a certain <italic>x</italic> value provides poor prediction for the corresponding <italic>y</italic> value, and vice versa. This prediction power could be critical, for instance, in a clinical setting where measurement <italic>x</italic> from an individual is used to gauge where this individual is on the <italic>y</italic> scale. However, in establishing the significance of a population-average trend such prediction power is often irrelevant because the uncertainty about the trend will diminish with sampling (which would effectively cancel out the symmetrical noise around the trend). For instance, pooling and averaging P<sub>r</sub> values over 25 μm distance bins in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1C</xref> data will increase Pearson's r to 0.80 although this would represent the same P<sub>r</sub> dataset. In the pooling exercise, we could sample 'groups of synapses' rather than individual synapses because multi-synapse recording is allowed by the context, as in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3</xref> data or in earlier studies (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Grillo et al., 2018</xref>). Thus, we must consider the statistical significance of the trend (p value for the non-zero slope) as a factor of prevailing importance, in the present context.</p></sec><sec id="s3-2"><title>Possible implications for dendritic signal integration</title><p>We have thus found that both classical OQA and the iGluSnFR approach point to the centrifugal increase of P<sub>r</sub> in apical dendrites of CA1 pyramidal cells. Intriguingly, an earlier study has found that at CA3-CA1 synapses release probability detected with OQA varies with the size of synaptic contacts (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Holderith et al., 2012</xref>). This finding, combined with the evidence for greater AMPAR receptor numbers at more distal synapses (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Andrasfalvy and Magee, 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">Nicholson et al., 2006</xref>), is fully consistent with the notion of P<sub>r</sub> increasing with the distance to the soma in these cells. Such data lend support to the idea that synaptic organisation can powerfully compensate for the 'electrotonic weakness' of synapses in distal dendrites. The effects found here are similar to the location-dependent features of synaptic inputs revealed with paired recordings between L2/3 and L5 pyramidal neurons in the neocortex (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib45">Williams and Stuart, 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib44">Williams and Atkinson, 2007</xref>). Clearly, the occurrence of the higher-efficacy synapses at distal dendrites must boost temporal summation of local CA3-CA1 inputs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib41">Stuart and Spruston, 2015</xref>). This is consistent with the observation that LTP induction there involves local sodium spikes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Kim et al., 2015</xref>). Furthermore, it has recently been found that individual CA3-CA1 axons make multiple synapses in distal (rather than proximal) dendrites of CA1 pyramidal cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Bloss et al., 2018</xref>). This further argues for added efficiency of distal synaptic connections, and is in line with the relatively high dendritic spine density found here. Because the spine density estimate could be affected by limited resolution of two-photon excitation imaging (which may not necessarily detect smallest or thinnest spines), it would be prudent to assume that here we refer mainly to larger, mushroom-type dendritic spines.</p><p>Notwithstanding methodological differences, comparing the present results with the earlier findings (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Grillo et al., 2018</xref>) suggests that the dendritic integration traits at basal and apical inputs in CA1 pyramidal cells are starkly different. Excitatory inputs to basal dendrites in the <italic>s. oriens</italic> include axons of other pyramidal cells, septal fibre, and commissural axons from the contralateral hippocampus. Interestingly, the spine density here increases almost twofold away from the soma (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Bannister and Larkman, 1995</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Ballesteros-Yáñez et al., 2006</xref>). Whether and how these different inputs cluster within different parts of the basal dendrites, and how their spiking activities differ, might shed light on the adaptive role of the apparently 'inefficient' P<sub>r</sub> pattern there. For instance, biophysical modelling of a simplified neuron suggested that the P<sub>r</sub> and PPR trends in basal dendrites help to facilitate supra-linear summation of local generative events such as dendritic spikes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Grillo et al., 2018</xref>). Indeed, such events have long been considered as a key mechanism of distal dendritic signalling (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Larkum and Nevian, 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Branco and Häusser, 2009</xref>).</p><p>In the present study, we explored a realistic model of a CA1 pyramidal cell (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">Migliore et al., 1999</xref>) hosting excitatory synapses that incorporated varied P<sub>r</sub> values, and were scattered across the apical dendrites, in accord with our experimentally observed trends. Simulations suggested that having the centrifugal P<sub>r</sub> trend boosts synaptic signal transfer across the physiological frequency range, with the effect monotonically increasing with higher firing frequencies. Importantly, in an intact rat brain, CA1 pyramidal cells tend to fire in short, high-frequency bursts (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Bähner et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Kowalski et al., 2016</xref>) associated with sharp-wave ripple complexes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Bähner et al., 2011</xref>). The latter type of synchronised neuronal activity is thought to represent a powerful mechanism of memory consolidation in the hippocampus (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Gruart et al., 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Buzsáki, 2015</xref>). In fact, short bursts of activity have long been considered as a key unit of information transfer by stochastic synapses (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Lisman, 1997</xref>). Thus, the P<sub>r</sub> trend found here in apical dendrites must play an essential role in supporting and enhancing the cellular underpinning of learning and memory in the brain.</p></sec></sec><sec

United Kingdom Home Office (Scientific Procedures) Act of 1986. Male Sprague Dawley rats (P20-P28) were sacriﬁced using an overdose of isoﬂurane. Animals were kept in groups (5–8 per cage) under standard housing conditions with 12 hr light–dark cycle and free access to food pellets and drinking water. Following decapitation brains were rapidly removed, hippocampi dissected out and transverse slices (350 µm thick) were prepared on a Leica VT1200S vibratome. The slicing was performed in ice-cold slicing solution that contained (in mM): 60 NaCl, 105 sucrose, 26 NaHCO<sub>3</sub>, 2.5 KCl, 1.25 NaH<sub>2</sub>PO<sub>4</sub>, 7 MgCl<sub>2</sub>, 0.5 CaCl<sub>2</sub>, 11 glucose, 1.3 ascorbic acid, and three sodium pyruvate. Alternatively, slices were cut in an ice-cold slicing solution that contained (in mM): 64 NaCl, 2.5 KCl, 1.25 NaH<sub>2</sub>PO<sub>4</sub>, 0.5 CaCl<sub>2</sub>, 7 MgCl<sub>2</sub>, 25 NaHCO<sub>3</sub>, 10 D-glucose, and 120 sucrose. All solutions were bubbled with 95% O<sub>2</sub> plus 5% CO<sub>2</sub>, pH adjusted to 7.4. Once cut, slices were incubated in the oxygenated slicing solution at 34°C for 15 min and then allowed to equilibrate to room temperature for 15 min following which they were transferred to either a continuously oxygenated humid interface chamber, or a submersion chamber. Both chamber types contained an oxygenated artiﬁcial cerebrospinal ﬂuid (aCSF) solution containing (in mM): 120 NaCl, 10 glucose, 2.5 KCl, 1.3 MgSO<sub>4</sub>, 1 NaH<sub>2</sub>PO<sub>4</sub>, 25 NaHCO<sub>3</sub>, 1.3 MgCl<sub>2</sub>, 2 CaCl<sub>2</sub>, with an osmolality of ~300 mOsm.

Cell-impermeable Ca<sup>2+</sup> dyes detailed below and the Ca<sup>2+</sup> insensitive morphological tracer Alexa Fluor 594 hydrazide (50 μM) were routinely added to the intracellular solution. Throughout recordings cells were held in voltage clamp at −65 mV, and the aCSF routinely supplemented with 100 µM Picrotoxin (Tocris Bioscience) and 30 µM D-Serine. Electrophysiological recordings were carried out by using a set of remotely controlled micromanipulators and XY-translation stage (Luigs and Neumann) with a Multiclamp 700B amplifier (Molecular Devices). Signals were digitised at 10 kHz and stored for off-line analysis using WinWCP V4.1.5–4.7 (John Dempster, University of Strathcyde) or PClamp 10.4–10.5 (Molecular Devices).</p></sec><sec id="s4-3"><title>Two-photon excitation imaging: optical quantal analysis</title><p>We used a Radiance 2100 imaging system (Zeiss–Bio-Rad; 60x Olympus objective, NA0.9) or a Femtonics Femto3D-RC imaging system (25x Olympus objective, NA1.05) both optically linked to two femtosecond pulse lasers MaiTai SpectraPhysics-Newport and integrated with patch-clamp electrophysiology.</p><p>Intracellular Ca<sup>2+</sup> responses were routinely imaged in the Ca<sup>2+</sup>-sensitive (green) emission channel filtered to the bandwidth of 500–550 nm, with either of the Ca<sup>2+</sup> sensitive dyes Oregon Green BAPTA-1 (250 μM, Invitrogen), Fluo-4 (400 μM, Invitrogen) or Fluo-8 (300 µM, Stratech Scientific). For optical quantal analysis, synaptically evoked responses in dendritic spines were triggered by minimal electrical stimulation using a monopolar glass stimulating electrode filled with aCSF and placed 10–20 µm from the dendritic branch targeted. To identify active synapses relatively fast (10 Hz) frame scans of the local dendrites were viewed whilst three 100 μs square pulses of 2–10 V were delivered with a 25 ms inter-stimulus interval using a constant voltage isolated stimulator (model DS2A-mkII, Digitimer Ltd, Welwyn Garden City, UK). This protocol was repeated until a Ca<sup>2+</sup> response confined to a spine head was observed, then 400–700 ms line scans of the active spine were then recorded at a line scan rate of 500 Hz. In order to reduce the inherent bias toward high release probability synapses, a dual stimulus protocol (50 ms inter-stimulus interval) was employed to ensure response stability at synapses with low initial release probability. Line scans were repeated once every 30 s with 14-26 trials to assess release probability while correcting manually for focus fluctuations in the Alexa (red) channel. Line scan profiles were extracted using ImageJ 1.x (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">Schneider et al., 2012</xref>) or Femtonics MES six and routinely documented as <italic>ΔG/R</italic> where <italic>ΔG</italic> = <italic>G - G<sub>0</sub></italic> stands for the fluorescence signal in the green channel <italic>G</italic> with the baseline fluorescence <italic>G<sub>0</sub></italic> (averaged over the baseline time window) subtracted, and <italic>R</italic> stands for the Alexa fluorescence in the red channel (corrected for photobleaching, if any). Where recordings of synaptic responses were made at two sites along a single dendritic branch (distal and proximal to the branch point), equal numbers of recordings, first proximal–distal and distal–proximal, were obtained to remove bias in the temporal order by which the recordings were carried out. Experiments were excluded if the synapse became non-responsive, if spine morphology visibly changed during recording or if significant drift of the stimulation electrode occurred. Release probability (P<sub>r</sub>) was defined as the probability of success on the first stimulus, as shown as P1 in figures: sum of successful trials / total number of trials, or {(1,0) + (1,1)} / (all); here brackets indicate counts of successes (1), failures (0), and all paired-stimulus trials (all). Where a second response was clearly visible over the first, P2 was also measured and defined as the sum of responses to the second stimulus + responses to both stimuli / total number of trials, or {(0,1) + (1,1)} / (all). PPR was defined as P2/P1 = P2/P<sub>r</sub>. To account for some uncertainty over the identification of (1,1) trials (because of Ca<sup>2+</sup> signal saturation upon the second stimulus), we also calculated adjusted PPR* = P2*/P1 where P2* = (0,1) / {(0,0) + (0,1)}, so that (1,1) counts were ignored.</p></sec><sec id="s4-4"><title>Two-photon excitation imaging: morphological measurements</title><p>For morphological tracing purposes, wide-field high-resolution images of the apical dendritic tree (&gt;75 µm<sup>2</sup>) were acquired at the maximal optical resolution as a series of individual 3-D stacks (50–100 μm deep each) in the Alexa emission channel (550–650 bandwidth; λ<sub>x</sub><sup>2p</sup> = 800 nm), collected in image frame mode (Biorad: 512 × 512 pixels, 8-bit; Femto3D &gt; 512×512 pixels, 16-bit) at 1.5–2.5 µm steps. These images were used to determine the location of the individual synapses in relation to the CA1 pyramidal cell soma, first the averaged Alexa 594 image stack was used to form a template defining the two-dimensional x-y path (along the dendrite) between soma and spine of interest. The start point of the distance measurement was defined as the centre of an oval shaped to fit the edges of the imaged soma, from this point the segmented line function in ImageJ was used to trace the path along the dendritic tree between the soma and the spine of interest ending at the base of the spines shaft. This line was then saved as a region of interest and then overlaid onto the original 3D image stack. The 'reslice' function in ImageJ was then used to form a two-dimensional y-z image in which the y-axis represents the length of the template line and the z-axis representing the deviation in the depth of the slice thus enabling simple measurement of distance from soma to synapse also accounting for z-plane deviation. With this method, the distances from the origin of and to the end of the parent dendrite were also obtained. Higher magnification images of the same resolution were also acquired and the density of spines local to the synapse estimated by counting the total number of visible protrusions along a 10 µm portion of dendrite centred on the synapse of interest.</p></sec><sec id="s4-5"><title>Viral transduction for labelling Schaffer collateral axonal boutons</title><p>For ex vivo imaging of axonal boutons, viral transduction in vivo via neonatal intracerebroventricular (ICV) injections in both male and female C57BL/6J mice (Charles River Laboratories) were used, as we detailed earlier (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Henneberger et al., 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Kopach et al., 2020</xref>). Briefly, an AAV virus expressing the neuronal optical glutamate sensor, AAV9.hSynap.iGluSnFR.WPRE.SV40 (supplied by Penn Vector Core, PA) was injected into the cerebral ventricles of neonates (P0-P1) during aseptic surgery. The viral particles were injected at 2 µl per hemisphere (2.5–5 × 10<sup>9</sup> genomic copies in total), at a rate not exceeding of 0.2 µl/s, 2 mm deep, guided to a location approximately 250 µm lateral to the sagittal suture and 500–750 µm rostral to the neonatal coronary suture. After animals received AAV injections, they were returned to the mother in their home cage; they were systematically kept as a group of litters and monitored for days thereafter, to ensure that no detrimental side effects appear. Satisfactory transduction of iGluSnFR in vivo occurred within 3–4 weeks.</p><p>Two-photon excitation (2PE) imaging of glutamate release with iGluSnFR iGluSnFR fluorescence was recorded in the green emission channel under 2PE at λ<sub>x</sub><sup>2P</sup>=910 nm, using a Femtonics Femto3D-RC imaging system or an Olympus FV10MP imaging system, both optically linked to a Ti:Sapphire MaiTai femtosecond-pulse laser (SpectraPhysics-Newport), equipped with galvo scanners, and integrated with patch-clamp electrophysiology. In the <italic>s.radiatum,</italic> we focused on individual axonal boutons that could be visualised by iGluSnFR expression and showed a consistent optical response to electric stimuli applied to Schaffer collaterals. To minimise photodamage, only a single focal section through the region of interest (ROI) containing selected axonal fragments was imaged, at laser power not exceeding 3–6 mW under the objective. The focal plane was regularly adjusted, to account for specimen drift. To record optical signals with high spatiotemporal resolution while minimising photodamage, we employed the scanning mode of spiral ('tornado') linescans centred at the bouton of interest, as detailed previously (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Jensen et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Jensen et al., 2019</xref>).

This approach was chosen because regions of interest had to be selected off-line post hoc, based on their overall morphological stability: burst stimulation could lead to microscopic focal drifts or tissue changes in some areas, which had to be avoided.

Simulations were performed using a variable time step <italic>dt</italic>; the cell axial-specific resistance <italic>R<sub>a</sub></italic> and capacitance C<sub>m</sub> were set at <italic>R<sub>a</sub></italic> = 90 Om·cm, and <italic>C<sub>m</sub></italic> = 1 mF/cm<sup>2</sup>, throughout simulations. Fifty synapses were distributed over the dendritic apical tree, between 40 and 350 µm from the soma, either uniformly randomly or scattered randomly in accord with the experimental statistical trend, as specified. Computation tests for any set of parameters routinely consisted of 100 runs (trials). To avoid any bias arising from a particular (fixed) distribution of synapses along the dendrites, this distribution was generated anew at each trial, albeit with the same probability density function. However, in the tests where non-uniform and uniform distributions of P<sub>r</sub> were compared, the random generator seed was kept unchanged.</p><p>At individual synapses, excitatory synaptic conductance <italic>g<sub>s</sub>(t)</italic> was modelled using the dual-exponential formalism realised in the NEURON function Exp2Syn. The dynamics models synaptic activation as a change in synaptic conductance with a time course given by: <inline-formula><mml:math id="inf3"><mml:mrow><mml:msub><mml:mi>g</mml:mi><mml:mi>s</mml:mi></mml:msub><mml:mo>=</mml:mo><mml:msub><mml:mi>G</mml:mi><mml:mi>m</mml:mi></mml:msub><mml:mrow><mml:mo>(</mml:mo><mml:mrow><mml:mi>exp</mml:mi><mml:mo>(</mml:mo><mml:mo>−</mml:mo><mml:mi>t</mml:mi><mml:mo>/</mml:mo><mml:msub><mml:mi>τ</mml:mi><mml:mn>1</mml:mn></mml:msub><mml:mo>)</mml:mo><mml:mo>−</mml:mo><mml:mi>exp</mml:mi><mml:mo>(</mml:mo><mml:mo>−</mml:mo><mml:mi>t</mml:mi><mml:mo>/</mml:mo><mml:msub><mml:mi>τ</mml:mi><mml:mn>2</mml:mn></mml:msub><mml:mo>)</mml:mo></mml:mrow><mml:mo>)</mml:mo></mml:mrow></mml:mrow></mml:math></inline-formula> where <italic>τ<sub>1</sub></italic> and <italic>τ<sub>2</sub></italic> are the rise and decay time constants, respectively, and <italic>G<sub>m</sub></italic> is the factor defined by the peak synaptic conductance. The reverse potential of excitatory synapses was zero, in line with that for AMPA and NMDA receptor types. In line with the data reporting that synaptic strength increases centrifugally in apical dendrites of CA1 pyramidal cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Andrasfalvy and Magee, 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">Nicholson et al., 2006</xref>), <italic>G<sub>m</sub></italic> values were set proportional to the function <italic>f(x)</italic> = <italic>A·</italic>(0.51 + 0.002<italic>x</italic>) where <italic>x</italic> is the synapse-soma distance, and <italic>A</italic> is scaling factor (NEURON NetCon object), which in our case sets single-synapse conductance <italic>G<sub>m</sub></italic> (in µS). In simulations exploring subthreshold postsynaptic excitation, <italic>A</italic> was set at 0.002 µS, and in tests exploring the spiking input - output relationship <italic>A</italic> was set at 0.06 µS.</p><p>To replicate our experimental observations of release probability, the average P<sub>r</sub> (P1) was set at 0.36, and P2 at 0.77. These values remained constant throughout the synaptic population in the case of the uniform P<sub>r</sub> distribution. In the case of the experimental (centrifugal) P<sub>r</sub> trend, the P<sub>r</sub> (P1) and P2 values were set as a function of the synapse-soma distance <italic>x</italic>: P1 = (0.18 + 0.0012<italic>x</italic>), and P2 = (0.18 + 0.0012<italic>x</italic>) ∙ (3.31–0.0074<italic>x</italic>), reflecting experimental regressions, with the average P<sub>r</sub> value kept at 0.36 throughout, to ensure the unchanged overall efficacy of integrated synaptic input. Calculations started 300 ms following full stabilisation of the NEURON model.</p></sec><sec id="s4-7"><title>Sampling and statistics</title><p>The present study contained no longitudinal experiments or biological hypotheses based on multiple comparisons or experimental samples involving bootstrapping. Dendritic spines or axonal boutons were sampled in an arbitrary manner, as they appeared in the focal plane showing distinct morphology and clear (above two standard deviations of the no-response noise) stimulus-induced fluorescence responses. No exclusion criteria were applied to animals or slices, experiment sessions were discarded if the dendritic spine or axonal bouton became non-responsive, or if a significant drift of the stimulation electrode or preparation occurred. Blinding was not applicable to experimental manipulations during live recording sessions.</p><p>In real-time experiments, the statistical units were either individual dendritic spines, individual axonal boutons, or groups of axonal boutons where applicable, with the effect of experimental manipulation being the only factor of interest. In OQA experiments, 1–2 dendritic spines were successfully recorded from individual CA1 pyramidal cells, 1–2 cells were recorded per slice / animal. In iGluSnFR experiments, axonal boutons or group of boutons were sampled as explained in the text. The paired 'baseline-effect' comparison was therefore employed in all such experiments, in accord with the convention of electrophysiological experiments. The sample size was not predetermined because the variability of measured parameters - be it the variance for mean estimates or the unexplained Pearson's variance for regression estimates - was not known a priori, and there was no known restriction or bias in the cohort sampling. No repeated measures were included in testing biological hypotheses. Experimental readout involved live recording sessions carried out once per statistical unit.</p><p>Statistical data were routinely presented as mean ± SEM and sample size. Testing statistical significance of correlation / linear regression, involved a standard <italic>t</italic>-test for the slope parameter (equivalent to the correlation test), and included Pearson's r. Shapiro-Wilks tests for normality produced varied results across raw data samples. Accordingly, we used either the paired-sample <italic>t</italic>-test, or the paired-sample non-parametric Wilcoxon Signed Ranks test, where indicated.

First, because many researchers have temporarily lost access to the labs, we will give authors as much time as they need to submit revised manuscripts. We are also offering, if you choose, to post the manuscript to bioRxiv (if it is not already there) along with this decision letter and a formal designation that the manuscript is &quot;in revision at <italic>eLife</italic>&quot;. Please let us know if you would like to pursue this option. (If your work is more suitable for medRxiv, you will need to post the preprint yourself, as the mechanisms for us to do so are still in development.)</p><p>Summary:</p><p>Prior work has established that neuronal sensitivity to released transmitter scales with distance from the axon so as to mitigate limitations of integrating more distal synapses. Here, the authors show for the first time that presynaptic release of glutamate is also &quot;scaled&quot; with distance. This is an important finding that potentially changes how we think about synaptic integration in these well studied hippocampal neurons, but reviewers raise concerns over aspects of the analyses that need to be addressed. Acceptability of the manuscript will be assessed after it is clearer whether or not the reanalysis supports the central claims of the paper.</p><p>Title: It is <italic>eLife</italic> policy that the title should make clear the biological system under investigation.

They find a trend towards higher release probabilities and less facilitation at distal synapses. Synapses that are close together (&lt; 40 um) had similar release probabilities. It is reassuring to see a similar distance-dependent decrease of paired-pulse ratios using two very different parameters, single spine calcium and local glutamate (pooled from several synapses). Opposite gradients have been described for synapses on the proximal dendrites of CA1 neurons (Grillo, 2018), which makes this study interesting and controversial. The authors then use a Neuron model to compare synaptic inputs with uniform properties to inputs that reflect the detected trend to higher Pr at distal inputs. Higher frequencies are indeed better transmitted in the model with a gradient in Pr. This seems to be a good way to test the intuition about the impact of the scaling effect, but I have some questions about the simulated scenarios (below).</p><p>While the spine calcium imaging experiments are performed with a local stimulation electrode positioned close to each responding spine, the glutamate experiments use a single stimulation electrode position in stratum radiatum, but read-out in different layers. Although GluSnFR expression is punctate, the optical measurements represent bulk extracellular glutamate and not individual synapses. Therefore, the distance from the simulation electrode is likely the key parameter determining max df/f at different positions. The paired pulse ratio is the only parameter that can be extracted from the glu imaging experiments.</p><p>1) The discussion of correlations is focused on their p-values (which indicate that the slope of a linear regression is not zero). Biologically more interesting are the correlation coefficients, which indicate (after squaring) that only a small part of the total variability in Pr is determined by synapse position. Correlations with R squared = 0.18 (Figure 1C) or 0.14 (Figure 2A) are considered &quot;very weak&quot;, which is not necessarily what you expect given the title of the manuscript. As all data points are shown, readers will form their own opinion and realize that synapse position has only a weak impact on presynaptic properties. Still, I recommend showing the numerical value of r (or r squared) on all panels with linear fits (and relegate &quot;n&quot; to the figure legends).</p><p>2) Figure 3C shows strong facilitation at proximal synapses, linear behavior at distal synapses, which the authors take as supporting evidence that Pr is higher at distal synapses. However, the first pulse amplitude is similar (Figure 3D, averaging failures and successes), which the authors explain away by saying these measurements average glutamate from at least 60 synapses, some of which might not be stimulated. In other words, given the position of the stimulation electrode distal from the cell body layer, the fraction of activated axons is likely higher at distal ROIs, compensating for their lower Pr. This argument (from the authors!) renders the burst experiments moot (Figure 3—figure supplement 1), as the read-out is df/f (measured in large ROIs), which is mainly a function of the density of active axons. Thus, the burst response slope is expected to be steepest close to the tip of the stimulation electrode. Indeed, ROIs close to the cell body layer (80-100 μm from soma layer) showed no response at all in these experiments (Figure 3—figure supplement 1C)! The burst experiments should therefore be removed unless there is a possibility to normalize the data to the 1st pulse responses (as in PPR analysis).</p><p>3) Modeling (subsection “A realistic biophysical model explains the role of the release probability trend”), &quot;with the Pr values distributed in accord with our data (Figure 1C)&quot;. According to the Materials and methods, you used the slope of the linear fit, which is not the same as the distribution of the measured Pr values (which are much more variable). This has to be clear in the text. In Figure 1C, some synapses have distances &gt; 300 um, but the most distal synapses in the model seem to be just 150 μm from the soma. Is there a reason why you did not place synapses on the distal apical dendrite of the model? Given you put only proximal synapses in your model, was the average release probability and the PPR in the &quot;Pr trend&quot; simulation identical to the average from the measurements? The comparison of the different model scenarios only makes sense if the average Pr and facilitation was identical in all scenarios. Please show the distribution of synaptic properties for all scenarios. If the gradients really matter, I would also expect a comparison of the frequency response to proximal vs distal inputs (as in Grillo, 2018).</p></body></sub-article><sub-article article-type="reply" id="sa2"><front-stub><article-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.62588.sa2</article-id><title-group><article-title>Author response</article-title></title-group></front-stub><body><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Essential revisions:</p><p>The full reviews are included below to help clarify the concerns.

To gauge release probability along the dendritic tree, Smith et al., used an MK801-based approach (their Figure 8A) while recording NMDAR responses in a Mg-free solution and 2.5 mM Ca<sup>2+</sup>. While they detected no significant difference between proximal and distal synapses, the removal of Mg<sup>2+</sup> might have had a significant, possibly heterogeneous, effect on P<sub>r</sub> across synaptic populations. In addition, the MK801-based approach is sensitive to the extent of local extrasynaptic glutamate escape (spillover) (Scimemi et al., 2004), which could bias comparative analyses of P<sub>r</sub>.</p><p>Intriguingly, Smith et al' s own data show 15-50% lower average PPR values (consistently over 25-200 ms paired-pulse intervals) in distal compared to proximal synapses (their Figure 8Biii).

To follow the Reviewer's request, here we have measured the first-response amplitudes of successes and failures (over the same sampling interval post-pulse) in all trials throughout; the plot of average values (per spine, mean ± SD) has been added to Figure 1—figure supplement 1D. These data show that the success amplitude was consistently above 2SD of the failure signal fluctuations, and that there were no distance-dependent trends. The text has been expanded accordingly (subsection “Monitoring release probability with optical quantal analysis”).</p><p>iGluSnFR and OQA: Our previous work detailed a robust OQA approach for the iGluSnFR signals recorded in a single axon in response to action potentials elicited in one presynaptic cell (Jensen et al., 2017; 2019). However, attempts to employ a similar method under local extracellular stimulation turned out to be much less straightforward because in most cases it was not possible to separate out a glutamate spillover signal originating from neighbouring synapses. There are good reasons for that. In the hippocampal neuropil, released glutamate molecules can travel for up to ~2 μm (e.g., Armbuster et al., 2020) whereas individual synapses are likely to have &gt;60 neighbours within the 2 μm proximity radius (sphere volume of ~33 μm<sup>3</sup> at synaptic density of ~2 μm<sup>-2</sup>). Furthermore, 2PE imaging integrates fluorescent signal collected over an ~1 μm thick focal plane. Thus, local extracellular stimulation is likely to generate a glutamate spillover signal even if it excites only a small fraction of local axons. The iGluSnFR signals induced by local extracellular stimuli tend to report, therefore, release activity of a small group of local synapses, which makes this approach usable for PPR measurements rather than for direct P<sub>r</sub> estimates. We have added the corresponding discussion (subsection “Monitoring glutamate release at CA3-CA1 synapses with an optical sensor”).</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>3) As the senior author and colleagues proposed 14 years ago PPR can be release-independent (Volynski et al., 2006) and therefore makes a poor predictor of release probability.

I think the authors should at least make sure that this is not a simple technical issue (e.g. location and intensity of stimulation etc.).</p></disp-quote><p>Indeed, in the past we were able to detect a release-independent component of PPR at paired-pulse intervals of 5 ms (Volynski et al., 2006), but it has long been argued that such phenomena fade away at 50 ms intervals. Nonetheless, we have added an alternative PPR measure, which was suggested by reviewer #3 and which deals precisely with the release-independent probability of the second release (Figure 1E). This addition had no effect on our conclusions.</p><p>As explained above, 2PE iGluSnFR imaging under extracellular stimulation is likely to pick up glutamate spillover signals originating at numerous neighbouring synapses. However, the overwhelming numbers of high-affinity glutamate transporters (with or without iGluSnFR present) normally ensure that such spillover can produce only a tiny NMDAR current at neighbouring synapses (e.g., Armbuster et al., 2020). Given the classical non-linear and saturating (S-shaped) sensitivity of postsynaptic Ca<sup>2+</sup> fluorescence to NMDAR current, spillover should have little effect on OQA readout near the bottom (release failure) and near the top (release success) of the scale. Indeed, multiple studies involving classical OQA or single-synapse LTP induction have indicated that, under suitable protocols, postsynaptic Ca<sup>2+</sup> signals elicited either by local afferent stimuli or by glutamate uncaging, do not spread to neighbouring spines. We have added the corresponding explanations (subsection “Assessing Pr using optical quantal analysis and paired-pulse ratios”).</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Reviewer #3:</p><p>I am not able to assess the manuscript in its current form, as I have doubts about the extraction of quantal parameters from the fluorescence traces.

In fact, all the success-failure scores and all related data, for all spines, could be found in the Source data file supplied with the manuscript (Figure 1—source data 1).

In our case, the unexplained variance (1-r<sup>2</sup>) reflects inherent biological variability of P<sub>r</sub> among individual synapses, which is a well acknowledged phenomenon. The central effect we see is not small, it is rather large (P<sub>r</sub> changes from ~0.2 at proximal to ~0.5 at distal synapses), but it is the large P<sub>r</sub> variability that leads to a relatively low r. The reviewer correctly points out that low r values imply poor predictability of the regression trend based on an individual specimen: thus, high Pearson's r could be critical in clinical studies that seek to classify an individual's condition. But this is irrelevant to our quest because we are not interested in the action of individual synapses. As nerve cells are incessantly bombarded by synaptic discharges, our focus is on the overall trend (that transpires over virtually unlimited sampling), rather than on the symmetric variability / noise around this trend. In this context, high P<sub>r</sub> variability is effectively cancelled out as we observe the average trend: the latter, in turn, has a significant effect on signal integration, as shown by our simulations.</p><p>To illustrate our point further, here we pooled and averaged all individual P<sub>r</sub> values over the respective 25 μm distance bins. This narrowed down the P<sub>r</sub> scatter along the regression line and thus increased Pearson's r to a 'strong' ~0.80. This synapsepooling exercise is somewhat representative of the case of multi-synaptic responses, as our iGluSnFR recordings or in Grillo et al., 2018. Judging by Pearson's r, the effect here appears much 'stronger' than we had with individual P<sub>r</sub> values (r ~0.41), but in reality, it represents exactly the same P<sub>r</sub> data set. We would therefore argue against overinterpreting Pearson's r as an indicator of the effect 'strength' of ‘weakness', in the present context.</p><p>We have expanded our explanations as a discussion point (subsection “Monitoring release probability with optical quantal analysis”, subsection “Possible implications for dendritic signal integration”) and revised figure labelling as suggested.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>2) The analysis of the burst experiments should be revised along the lines suggested below, or these experiments should be removed or the concern raised adequately rebutted.</p></disp-quote><p>The corresponding reviewer's critique reads <italic>&quot;</italic>Thus, the burst response slope is expected to be steepest close to the tip of the stimulation electrode.

It is this regression slope (between first - fifth response peaks) that was close to zero in Figure 3—figure supplement 1C whereas the ΔF/F amplitudes were equally large at proximal and distal sites, as shown in Figure 3D.

As nerve cells are incessantly bombarded by synaptic discharges, our focus is on the overall trend (that transpires over virtually unlimited sampling), rather than on the symmetric variability / noise around this trend. In this context, high P<sub>r</sub> variability is effectively cancelled out as we observe the average trend: the latter, in turn, has a significant effect on signal integration, as shown by our simulations.</p><p>To illustrate our point further, here we pooled and averaged all individual P<sub>r</sub> values over the respective 25 μm distance bins. This narrowed down the P<sub>r</sub> scatter along the regression line and thus increased Pearson's r to a 'strong' ~0.80. This synapsepooling exercise is somewhat representative of the case of multi-synaptic responses, as our iGluSnFR recordings or in Grillo et al., 2018. Judging by Pearson's r, the effect here appears much 'stronger' than we had with individual P<sub>r</sub> values (r ~0.41), but in reality, it represents exactly the same P<sub>r</sub> data set.

However, the first pulse amplitude is similar (Figure 3D, averaging failures and successes), which the authors explain away by saying these measurements average glutamate from at least 60 synapses, some of which might not be stimulated. In other words, given the position of the stimulation electrode distal from the cell body layer, the fraction of activated axons is likely higher at distal ROIs, compensating for their lower Pr. This argument (from the authors!) renders the burst experiments moot (Figure 3 supplement 1), as the read-out is df/f (measured in large ROIs), which is mainly a function of the density of active axons.</p></disp-quote><p>We note here that the ΔF/F amplitude generated under extracellular stimulation is a poor predictor of P<sub>r</sub> because of multiple, poorly-controlled factors affecting the optical glutamate spillover signal, such as: varied local synaptic density or inter-synaptic distance (e.g., a sharp increase in the occurrence of multi-synapse axonal boutons along the s. radiatum – s. lacunosum moleculare direction has been reported, Bloss et al., 2018), varied axonal density or axonal excitability under the stimulating electrode, varied expression ratio for iGluSnFR vs GLT-1 transporters that would have a complex effect on glutamate escape per se as well as on the detected optical signal, etc. These issues have been discussed in the text.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Thus, the burst response slope is expected to be steepest close to the tip of the stimulation electrode. Indeed, ROIs close to the cell body layer (80-100 μm from soma layer) showed no response at all in these experiments (Figure 3—figure supplement 1C)! The burst experiments should therefore be removed unless there is a possibility to normalize the data to the 1st pulse responses (as in PPR analysis).</p></disp-quote><p>There must have been some confusion here. The data in question (Figure 3—figure supplement 1) deal with the regression slope between first - fifth ΔF/F response peaks, which we employed as a crude short-term plasticity indicator during the burst. This slope indicator (in %ΔF/F s<sup>-1</sup> units) has nothing to do with the absolute ΔF/F amplitudes, hence little to do with the synaptic density or electrode position. It is this regression slope (between first - fifth response peaks) that was close to zero in Figure 3—figure supplement 1C whereas the ΔF/F amplitudes were equally large at proximal and distal sites, as shown in Figure 3D. We have clarified this further (subsection “Monitoring glutamate release at CA3-CA1 synapses with an optical sensor”; Figure 3—figure supplement 1C legend).</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>3) Modeling (subsection “A realistic biophysical model explains the role of the release probability trend”), &quot;with the Pr values distributed in accord with our data (Figure 1C)&quot;.
