transmembrane precursors that are released by proteolytic cleavage (‘shedding’) from the cell surface. ADAM17, a membrane-tethered metalloprotease, is the primary shedding enzyme responsible for the release of the inflammatory cytokine TNFα and several EGF receptor ligands. ADAM17 exists in complex with the rhomboid-like iRhom proteins, which act as cofactors that regulate ADAM17 substrate shedding. Here we report that the poorly characterised FERM domain-containing protein FRMD8 is a new component of the iRhom2/ADAM17 sheddase complex. FRMD8 binds to the cytoplasmic N-terminus of iRhoms and is necessary to stabilise iRhoms and ADAM17 at the cell surface. In the absence of FRMD8, iRhom2 and ADAM17 are degraded via the endolysosomal pathway, resulting in the reduction of ADAM17-mediated shedding. We have confirmed the pathophysiological significance of FRMD8 in iPSC-derived human macrophages and mouse tissues, thus demonstrating its role in the regulated release of multiple cytokine and growth factor signals.</p></abstract><abstract abstract-type="executive-summary"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.35012.002</object-id><title>eLife digest</title><p>Cells in the human body communicate with one another for many different reasons, including to help organs develop correctly and to produce a healthy reponse to injury and infection. Signalling proteins, such as growth factors and cytokines, form the main language of this communication.</p><p>Initially, many growth factors and cytokines remain attached to the surface of the cell that made them. When cells need to send a message to another one, an enzyme called ADAM17 acts like a pair of scissors to release the proteins from the cell surface, allowing them to travel towards other cells. This process must be carefully controlled because releasing too many growth factors or cytokines (or releasing them at inappropriate times) can lead to cancer and inflammatory diseases such as rheumatoid arthritis.</p><p>Another group of proteins called iRhoms bind to ADAM17 to regulate the enzyme’s activity. But what controls the activity of the iRhom proteins themselves? To find out, Künzel et al. used a technique called a proteomic screen that can identify which proteins bind to each other. This revealed that a protein called FRMD8 binds to iRhoms. Further experiments in human cells and mice revealed that FRMD8 maintains adequate levels of both ADAM17 and iRhoms at the surface of the cell. Cells that lack FRMD8 break down ADAM17 and iRhom proteins and release fewer growth factors and cytokines.</p><p>Further work could help us to learn whether stopping FRMD8 from interacting with iRhoms could reduce cell communication. This, in turn, might reduce inflammation or cell growth. If so, then developing drugs that prevent FRMD8 from binding to iRhoms could lead to new treatments for inflammatory diseases and cancer.</p></abstract><kwd-group kwd-group-type="author-keywords"><kwd>iRhom</kwd><kwd>rhomboid</kwd><kwd>inflammation</kwd><kwd>ADAM17</kwd></kwd-group><kwd-group kwd-group-type="research-organism"><title>Research organism</title><kwd>Human</kwd><kwd>Mouse</kwd></kwd-group><funding-group><award-group id="fund1"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100004440</institution-id><institution>Wellcome</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>101035/Z/13/Z</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Freeman</surname><given-names>Matthew</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund2"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100000265</institution-id><institution>Medical Research Council</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>1374214</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Künzel</surname><given-names>Ulrike</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund3"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100001645</institution-id><institution>Boehringer Ingelheim Fonds</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>PhD Fellowship</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Künzel</surname><given-names>Ulrike</given-names></name><name><surname>Sieber</surname><given-names>Boris</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund4"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100010661</institution-id><institution>Horizon 2020 Framework Programme</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>659166</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Grieve</surname><given-names>Adam Graham</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund5"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100000265</institution-id><institution>Medical Research Council</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>MC_EX_MR/N50192X/1</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Cowley</surname><given-names>Sally A</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund6"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100004440</institution-id><institution>Wellcome</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>Oxford Wellcome Institutional Strategic Support Fund 121302</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Cowley</surname><given-names>Sally A</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><funding-statement>The funders had no role in study design, data collection and interpretation, or the decision to submit the work for publication.</funding-statement></funding-group><custom-meta-group><custom-meta specific-use="meta-only"><meta-name>Author impact statement</meta-name><meta-value>The protein FRMD8 binds to iRhom and thereby stabilises the iRhom/ADAM17 complex, which is the primary trigger of inflammatory signalling.</meta-value></custom-meta></custom-meta-group></article-meta></front><body><sec id="s1" sec-type="intro"><title>Introduction</title><p>The cell surface protease ADAM17 (also called TACE) mediates the release of many important signalling molecules by ‘shedding’ their extracellular ligand domains from transmembrane precursors. A prominent example is the role of ADAM17 in releasing tumour necrosis factor alpha (TNFα) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Black et al., 1997</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Moss et al., 1997</xref>), a primary cytokine involved in the inflammatory responses to infection and tissue damage (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Kalliolias and Ivashkiv, 2016</xref>). In addition, ADAM17 is the principal sheddase of the epidermal growth factor (EGF) receptor ligands amphiregulin (AREG), transforming growth factor alpha (TGFα), heparin-binding EGF (HB-EGF), epigen, and epiregulin (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">Sahin et al., 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">Sahin and Blobel, 2007</xref>). The control of ADAM17 activity has therefore been the focus of much fundamental and pharmaceutical research (reviewed in [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">Rose-John, 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib44">Zunke and Rose-John, 2017</xref>]). We and others have previously reported that the rhomboid-like iRhom proteins have a specific and extensive regulatory relationship with ADAM17, to the extent that iRhoms can effectively be considered as regulatory subunits of the protease (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Grieve et al., 2017</xref>). iRhoms are members of a wider family of evolutionarily related multi-pass membrane proteins, called the rhomboid-like superfamily (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Freeman, 2014</xref>). The family is named after the rhomboids, intramembrane serine proteases that cleave substrate transmembrane domains (TMDs), but many members, including iRhoms, have lost protease activity during evolution. iRhom1 and its paralogue iRhom2 (encoded by the genes <italic>RHBDF1</italic> and <italic>RHBDF2</italic>) show redundancy in regulating ADAM17 maturation, but differ in their tissue expression (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Christova et al., 2013</xref>). Many cell types express both iRhoms, so the loss of one can be compensated by the other (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Christova et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Li et al., 2015</xref>). Macrophages are, however, an exception: iRhom1 is not expressed, so iRhom2 alone regulates ADAM17 and therefore TNFα inflammatory signalling in macrophages (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Adrain et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">McIlwain et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Issuree et al., 2013</xref>). iRhoms control ADAM17 activity in multiple ways. First, they bind to the catalytically immature pro-form of ADAM17 (proADAM17) in the endoplasmic reticulum (ER), and are required for its trafficking from the ER to the Golgi apparatus (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Adrain et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">McIlwain et al., 2012</xref>). Once proADAM17 reaches the Golgi, it is matured by the removal of its inhibitory pro-domain by pro-protein convertases (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">Schlöndorff et al., 2000</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Endres et al., 2003</xref>) and is further trafficked to the plasma membrane. iRhoms have further regulatory functions beyond this step of ADAM17 maturation. Still bound to each other, iRhom2 prevents the lysosomal degradation of ADAM17 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Grieve et al., 2017</xref>). Later, iRhom2 controls the activation of ADAM17: the phosphorylation of the iRhom2 cytoplasmic tail promotes the recruitment of 14-3-3 proteins, which promote the shedding activity of ADAM17, thereby releasing TNFα from the cell surface in response to inflammatory triggers (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Grieve et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Cavadas et al., 2017</xref>). Finally, iRhoms are also reported to contribute to ADAM17 substrate specificity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Maretzky et al., 2013</xref>). This intimate regulatory role of iRhoms make them essential players in ADAM17-mediated signalling and thus new targets for manipulating inflammatory signalling. The significance of this potential is underlined by the fact that anti-TNFα therapies, used to treat rheumatoid arthritis and other inflammatory diseases, are currently the biggest grossing drugs in the world (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Monaco et al., 2015</xref>).</p><p>Despite the role of the iRhom/ADAM17 shedding complex in controlling signalling, much is yet to be understood about the molecular mechanisms that control this inflammatory trigger. To identify the wider machinery by which iRhoms regulate ADAM17, we report here a proteomic screen to identify their binding partners. We have identified the poorly characterised FERM domain-containing protein 8 (FRMD8) as having a strong and specific interaction with the cytoplasmic N-terminus of iRhoms. The functional significance of this interaction is demonstrated by loss of FRMD8 causing a similar phenotype to iRhom deficiency in cells: loss of mature ADAM17 and severely reduced shedding of ADAM17 substrates from the cell surface. We show that loss of FRMD8 leads to lysosomal degradation of mature ADAM17 and iRhom2, indicating that its function is to stabilise the iRhom/ADAM17 sheddase complex once it reaches the plasma membrane. Overall, our results imply that FRMD8 is an essential component of the inflammatory signalling machinery. To test this proposal <italic>in vivo</italic> we deleted the <italic>FRMD8</italic> gene in human induced pluripotent stem cells (iPSCs) and differentiated them into macrophages. Consistent with our biochemical data, these mutant macrophages were defective in their ability to release TNFα in response to lipopolysaccharide (LPS) stimulation, demonstrating the pathophysiological importance of FRMD8 in the normal inflammatory response by human macrophages. The <italic>in vivo</italic> significance of FRMD8 in regulating the stability of the iRhom/ADAM17 shedding complex was further reinforced by our observation that mature ADAM17 and iRhom2 protein levels are strongly reduced in tissues of FRMD8-deficent mice.</p></sec><sec id="s2" sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><sec id="s2-1"><title>FRMD8 is a novel interaction partner of iRhom1 and iRhom2</title><p>To investigate the molecular mechanisms that underlie iRhom2 functions, we performed a mass spectrometry-based screen to identify new proteins that interact with human iRhom2. iRhom2-3xHA was stably expressed in human embryonic kidney (HEK) 293T cells and immunoprecipitated. The bead eluates containing immunoprecipitated iRhom2 and its interacting proteins were analysed by label-free mass spectrometry. As a negative control, we did the same analysis in parallel with 3xHA-tagged UNC93B1, an unrelated polytopic protein that, like iRhom2, is predominantly located in the ER (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Koehn et al., 2007</xref>) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1A</xref>). Quantitative protein abundance data from three biological replicates of iRhom2 and UNC93B1 co-immunoprecipitations were statistically analysed using the Perseus software platform (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib41">Tyanova et al., 2016</xref>). Validating the overall approach, we detected ADAM17, the known iRhom2 interacting protein (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Adrain et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">McIlwain et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Christova et al., 2013</xref>) as a statistically significant hit (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1A</xref>, <xref ref-type="table" rid="table1">Table 1</xref>). Among the hits were several 14-3-3 proteins (eta, epsilon, gamma, sigma, theta, zeta/delta) and MAPK1/3 (<xref ref-type="table" rid="table1">Table 1</xref>), which we have previously reported to participate in the regulation of inflammatory signalling by phosphorylation of iRhom2 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Grieve et al., 2017</xref>).

Together these results identify FRMD8 as a bona fide binding partner of iRhom1 and iRhom2 in human cells.</p></sec><sec id="s2-2"><title>FRMD8 is required for iRhom function</title><p>As its name indicates, FRMD8 is a FERM (4.1/ezrin/radixin/moesin) domain-containing protein.

To investigate the functional significance of FRMD8 binding to iRhoms, we examined the effects of loss of FRMD8 on iRhom function in HEK293T cells, using both siRNA and CRISPR/Cas9-mediated gene deletion (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2A,B</xref>). In both cases, loss of FRMD8 drastically reduced the protein levels of mature ADAM17 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2A,B</xref>). This effect was specific to ADAM17, as the maturation of its closest homologue, ADAM10, was unaffected by loss of FRMD8 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2B</xref>). Moreover, mature ADAM17 levels were rescued by expression of FRMD8-V5 in FRMD8 knockout HEK293T cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2C</xref>), confirming that the phenotype was caused by FRMD8 loss. Finally, in addition to this reduction of mature ADAM17 caused by FRMD8 loss, we found a striking loss of ADAM17, but not ADAM10, on the cell surface (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2D</xref>).

To exclude the possibility that the defect in FRMD8 knockout cells is an inability to respond to PMA, we measured both PMA-stimulated and unstimulated, constitutive shedding of AP-tagged TGFα, another major EGFR ligand. Again, FRMD8 knockout cells released significantly less AP-TGFα compared to wild-type cells, both after stimulation but also after 20 hr of constitutive shedding (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2F</xref>), implying that mutant cells had fundamental defects in their ability to shed ADAM17 ligands, regardless of PMA stimulation. To demonstrate that the release of ligands was indeed caused by metalloprotease shedding and not simply an indication of leakage caused by cell death, we showed that it was sensitive to the ADAM10/17 inhibitor GW280264X (GW) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2E,F</xref>). Overall, as with ADAM17 maturation, the shedding defects in FRMD8-deficient cells resemble those caused by the loss of iRhoms.</p></sec><sec id="s2-3"><title>FRMD8 binds to the cytoplasmic iRhom2 N-terminus and regulates mature ADAM17 levels</title><p>As described above, iRhoms regulate ADAM17 function at multiple stages: from ER-to-Golgi trafficking, to the activation of the sheddase at the cell surface. To address where FRMD8 fits in this long-term relationship between iRhoms and ADAM17, we started by analysing the FRMD8 binding site within iRhom2. As a cytoplasmic protein, FRMD8 was likely to bind to the only substantial cytoplasmic region of iRhom2, its N-terminus. We therefore made a set of iRhom2-3xHA N-terminal deletion constructs (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3A</xref>) to locate the binding site. Deletion of the first 200 amino acids in the N-terminus of iRhom2 (iRhom2<sup>∆200</sup>) did not disrupt FRMD8 binding, but no interaction was detected in mutants greater than ∆300 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3B</xref>), implying that the region between 200 and 300 amino acids was necessary for FRMD8 binding. An internal deletion of amino acids 201–300 within iRhom2 (iRhom2<sup>∆201-300</sup>) led to the loss of exogenous FRMD8 binding (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3C</xref>), confirming that the FRMD8 binding site lies within this region. In line with this, an iRhom1/2 DKO cell line reconstituted with iRhom2<sup>∆201-300</sup> showed a similar deficiency to FRMD8 KO cells in ADAM17-mediated shedding of AREG (compare <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figures 3D</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">2E</xref>). This reduction in shedding correlates with a reduction in the level of mature ADAM17 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3E</xref>). Overall, this makes the iRhom2<sup>∆201-300</sup> mutant a useful tool to study the loss of FRMD8 binding to iRhom2 and highlights that FRMD8 binding affects levels of mature ADAM17, presumably either through controlling ADAM17 maturation or stability. Interestingly, the FRMD8 binding site is also absent in a mouse iRhom2 mutant called <italic>curly-bare (cub)</italic>, which lacks residues 1–268 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Hosur et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib40">Siggs et al., 2014</xref>). Sequence alignment shows that the deletion of 268 amino acids in mouse iRhom2 corresponds to the loss of residues 1–298 in the human protein (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s1">Figure 3—figure supplement 1A</xref>). Consistent with this mapping data, we found that whereas full-length mouse iRhom2 bound human FRMD8, the <italic>cub</italic> mutant cannot (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s1">Figure 3—figure supplement 1B</xref>).

Previous work has shown a strong interaction between iRhom2 and ADAM17 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Adrain et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">McIlwain et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Grieve et al., 2017</xref>), yet how FRMD8 intersects with this complex is not known. When performing an immunoprecipitation of FRMD8, we found both immature and mature ADAM17 as well as iRhom2 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4A</xref>). This indicates that FRMD8 does indeed form a tripartite complex with ADAM17 and iRhom2. To test this further, we performed a series of pairwise co-immunoprecipitations in the absence of FRMD8, ADAM17 or iRhoms. First we tested the requirement for ADAM17 in the iRhom2/FRMD8 interaction. We found that exogenous FRMD8 and iRhom2 co-immunoprecipitated with each other in ADAM17 knockout cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4B</xref>). In turn, iRhom2 and ADAM17 were still able to interact with each other in FRMD8 knockout cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4C</xref>), showing that FRMD8 is not essential for the iRhom/ADAM17 sheddase complex to form. In contrast, FRMD8 did not pull down ADAM17 in cells mutant for both iRhoms (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4D</xref>). This demonstrated that there is no direct link between FRMD8 and ADAM17; instead both bind simultaneously to iRhom2. Supporting this, FRMD8 co-immunoprecipitated with pro- or mature ADAM17 in iRhom1/2 DKO cells reconstituted with iRhom2<sup>WT</sup>, but not with iRhom2<sup>∆201-300</sup> (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4D</xref>), the mutant that does not bind to FRMD8 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3C</xref>).

Taken together, these data suggest that FRMD8 binding to iRhom2 stabilises the iRhom2 pool in the late secretory pathway and increases the cell surface localisation of the iRhom2/ADAM17 sheddase complex.</p></sec><sec id="s2-6"><title>FRMD8 recruitment protects iRhom2/ADAM17 from lysosomal degradation</title><p>Previous studies have shown that the cytoplasmic N-terminal region of iRhom2 is required to prevent lysosomal degradation of ADAM17 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Grieve et al., 2017</xref>). Therefore, we questioned whether the absence of FRMD8 recruitment to the iRhom2 N-terminus led to delivery of iRhom and ADAM17 to lysosomes. By immunofluorescence microscopy, iRhom2<sup>WT</sup> localisation is indistinguishable from iRhom2<sup>∆300</sup> (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6A,B</xref>) within the endoplasmic reticulum (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1A</xref>). However, upon treatment with the lysosomal degradation inhibitor, bafilomycin A1, both proteins accumulated in LAMP1-positive lysosomal puncta (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6C,D</xref>). This suggests that there is a constant turnover of iRhom2 through the endo-lysosomal pathway, with iRhoms presumably cycling via the plasma membrane, before being degraded. Interestingly, unlike the partial colocalisation between LAMP1 and iRhom2<sup>WT</sup> (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6C</xref>), iRhom2<sup>∆300</sup> overlapped completely with LAMP1 (indicated by the arrows in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6D</xref>). This confirmed that in the absence of FRMD8 recruitment, iRhom2 is constitutively sent to lysosomes. Importantly, this lysosomal pool of iRhom2<sup>∆300</sup> also colocalised with ADAM17-V5 after bafilomycin treatment (highlighted with arrows in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6F</xref>). All these data together indicate that the iRhom2/ADAM17 complex follow the same fate in the absence of FRMD8 recruitment (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6E,F</xref>). Using a complementary approach, we tested the stability of ADAM17 in FRMD8 knockout cells.

Most tagged iRhom2 is ER-localised (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1A</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6A</xref>) and the cell surface fraction is relatively small (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Maney et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Grieve et al., 2017</xref>). Therefore, we used cell surface immunostaining of iRhom2 followed by flow cytometry to measure specifically the pool of iRhom2 at the cell surface. In the absence of FRMD8 we detected a significant loss of cell surface iRhom2 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7A</xref>). In line with our observation that cell surface iRhom2 represents only a small fraction of the total pool, a reduction of total iRhom2 levels was not detectable (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7B</xref>). This further supports our observations that FRMD8 binding to iRhoms is required to stabilise the cell surface pool of iRhoms. Consistent with our conclusion that FRMD8 primarily functions late in the iRhom2/ADAM17 relationship, we detected no defects in the ER-based iRhom2/proADAM17 interaction in FRMD8 knockout cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4C</xref>), nor in the trafficking of iRhom2 from the ER to the Golgi (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7s1">Figure 7—figure supplement 1C</xref>).</p><p>Our results show that by binding to iRhom2, FRMD8 stabilises both iRhom2 and mature ADAM17, protecting them from degradation. A more direct demonstration of this stabilising function is provided by overexpressing FRMD8, which leads to increased levels of tagged iRhom2 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7C</xref>), as well as iRhom1 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7s1">Figure 7—figure supplement 1D</xref>). Note that the 50 kDa N-terminally truncated fragment of iRhoms detected in western blots (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Nakagawa et al., 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Adrain et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Maney et al., 2015</xref>) is not stabilised by FRMD8 expression (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7C</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7s1">Figure 7—figure supplement 1D</xref>). This iRhom fragment lacks the cytoplasmic tail, and therefore the binding site for FRMD8, so its insensitivity to FRMD8 is consistent with our model. Intriguingly, the stabilisation of iRhom2 and FRMD8 is mutual: overexpression of iRhom2 consistently led to the stabilisation of endogenous FRMD8 protein (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7D</xref>) without affecting FRMD8 mRNA levels (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7E</xref>). This indicates that the iRhom2-FRMD8 interaction leads to mutual stabilisation of both proteins as well as mutual effects on plasma membrane localisation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5A</xref>).</p><p>To ensure that our conclusion that FRMD8 stabilises iRhoms was not distorted by our use of overexpressed proteins, and in the absence of a usable antibody against human iRhom2, we used CRISPR/Cas9 to insert a triple HA tag into the <italic>RHBDF2</italic> locus to express endogenously C-terminally tagged iRhom2. siRNA-mediated knockdown of iRhom2 confirmed that this editing was successful (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8">Figure 8A</xref>).

Its regulation has therefore received much attention, both from the perspective of fundamental cell biology and because of the proven therapeutic significance of blocking TNFα (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Monaco et al., 2015</xref>). Here we report that FRMD8 is a new component of the regulatory machinery that controls the release of ADAM17 substrates, including TNFα. We identified FRMD8 as a prominent binding partner of iRhoms, which are rhomboid-like proteins that act as regulatory cofactors of ADAM17. Our subsequent experiments demonstrate that although FRMD8 binds to iRhoms throughout their life cycle, its function appears to be confined to the later stages of their role in regulating ADAM17. FRMD8 stabilises the iRhom2/ADAM17 complex at the cell surface, ensuring it is available to shed TNFα and growth factors. We took advantage of iPSC technology to generate human FRMD8 knockout macrophages, allowing us to confirm that the mechanistic conclusions derived mostly from HEK293T cell models were indeed relevant to the human cells that provide the primary inflammatory response. Finally, tissues from FRMD8 knockout mice demonstrate the physiological importance of FRMD8 in a whole organism, and confirm that it stabilises the iRhom/mature ADAM17 complex <italic>in vivo</italic>.</p><p>Bringing together all our results, we propose the following model of FRMD8 function in ADAM17-dependent signalling: FRMD8 binds to the cytoplasmic domain of iRhoms throughout the secretory pathway, forming a tripartite complex when iRhoms are also bound to ADAM17. Despite this long-term relationship, we have found no evidence for a functional role for FRMD8 in ER-to-Golgi trafficking or ADAM17 maturation. Instead, FRMD8 acts later, to prevent the endolysosomal degradation of the iRhom/ADAM17 complex (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig10">Figure 10</xref>). The exact molecular detail of FRMD8 action on the iRhom2/ADAM17 sheddase complex is unclear. It is possible that FRMD8 increases the delivery of the iRhom2/ADAM17 sheddase complex from the Golgi apparatus to the cell surface, stabilises the complex by preventing its internalisation, or promotes the endosomal retrieval to the cell surface. In all cases, it is likely that the recruitment of additional proteins is required. Therefore, understanding the molecular interactions of FRMD8, as well as the FRMD8/iRhom2/mature ADAM17 complex at the cell surface, will shed light into the molecular mechanism.</p><fig-group><fig id="fig10" position="float"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.35012.018</object-id><label>Figure 10.</label><caption><title>FRMD8 stabilises the iRhom2/ADAM17 sheddase complex at the cell surface.</title><p>Schematic representation of the role of FRMD8 in the iRhom2/ADAM17 pathway: under wild-type conditions ADAM17 and iRhom2 are stabilised by FRMD8 and thereby protected from degradation through the endolysosmal pathway.</p></caption><graphic mime-subtype="x-tiff" mimetype="image" xlink:href="elife-35012-fig10-v2"/></fig><fig id="fig10s1" position="float" specific-use="child-fig"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.35012.019</object-id><label>Figure 10—figure supplement 1.</label><caption><title>Lysates and anti-HA immunoprecipitation (HA-IP) from HEK293T cells transiently transfected with human FRMD8-V5 and mouse iRhom2<sup>WT</sup> (WT) or iRhom2<sup>pDEAD</sup> (pDEAD) were immunoblotted for V5 and HA.</title><p>Where indicated cells have been stimulated with 200 nM PMA for 30 min.</p></caption><graphic mime-subtype="x-tiff" mimetype="image" xlink:href="elife-35012-fig10-figsupp1-v2"/></fig></fig-group><p>As we have previously reported, it is the iRhom2/ADAM17 complex that is responsible for shedding ADAM17 substrates including TNFα. Without FRMD8, iRhoms and mature ADAM17 are destabilised and the cell cannot shed TNFα in response to an inflammatory challenge. Combined with our previous studies (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Grieve et al., 2017</xref>), this work has changed our perspective on ADAM17, the central enzyme in cytokine and growth factor shedding. Our evidence implies that it would be more appropriate to consider it as the active subunit of a regulatory complex at the cell surface, where iRhoms provide regulatory functions (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Maney et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Cavadas et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Grieve et al., 2017</xref>), and FRMD8 maintains the stability of the iRhom/ADAM17 complex post-ADAM17 maturation. It is essential that a pool of the sheddase is available on the cell surface to execute, for example, rapid cytokine release in response to inflammatory signals induced by bacterial infection.</p><p>In the only other paper about FRMD8 function, it was reported that FRMD8 (named Bili, after the Drosophila mutation) negatively regulates Wnt signalling by binding to the LRP6 co-receptor, thereby preventing the recruitment of the signal transduction protein axin (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Kategaya et al., 2009</xref>). Although the signalling event being regulated is different, there is the obvious parallel that in both cases FRMD8 binds to the cytoplasmic tail of a transmembrane protein. In the case of Wnt signalling, this prevents the recruitment of axin; in the case of iRhom function, we do not yet know what the next step in the molecular chain of events is, but the cellular consequence is to prevent recruitment of iRhoms into the endolysosomal degradation system.</p><p>Our results extend an important theme to emerge from a number of studies, namely the significance of the iRhom cytoplasmic N-terminal region in regulating iRhom/ADAM17 function. Several reports indicate that N-terminal mutations in iRhoms cause complex phenotypes that combine aspects of gain and loss of iRhom function, which is consistent with a regulatory function for this region. First, the <italic>cub</italic> mutation, an N-terminal deletion in mouse iRhom2, does not abolish protein function but instead modulates it in complex ways that are still poorly understood (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Hosur et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib40">Siggs et al., 2014</xref>). <italic>cub</italic> was described as a gain-of-function mutation that leads to constitutively elevated release of amphiregulin, but is also reported to be defective in releasing TNFα (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Hosur et al., 2014</xref>). Second, specific point mutations in the N-terminus of human iRhom2 are the cause of a rare genetic disorder called tylosis with oesophageal cancer (TOC) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Blaydon et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Saarinen et al., 2012</xref>). TOC mutations, as well as truncation of parts of the N-terminus have been reported to enhance the activity of ADAM17 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Maney et al., 2015</xref>), leading to the conclusion that parts of the N-terminus have inhibitory functions on ADAM17 function. Third, phosphorylation of specific sites in the iRhom2 N-terminus result in 14-3-3 binding and consequent activation of substrate shedding by associated ADAM17 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Grieve et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Cavadas et al., 2017</xref>), demonstrating that the N-terminus of iRhom2 also positively regulates ADAM17. The FRMD8 binding region does not overlap with these sites required for phosphorylation-dependent 14-3-3 binding, however it is formally possible that there is some functional overlap between them. We could not detect major changes in the interaction of FRMD8 with iRhom2 upon PMA stimulation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig10s1">Figure 10—figure supplement 1</xref>), which leads to the phosphorylation of iRhoms (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Grieve et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Cavadas et al., 2017</xref>). Moreover, an iRhom2 mutant, in which 15 conserved phosphorylation sites have been mutated to alanine (iRhom2<sup>pDEAD</sup>; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s1">Figure 3—figure supplement 1A</xref>) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Grieve et al., 2017</xref>), did not abolish the interaction with FRMD8 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig10s1">Figure 10—figure supplement 1</xref>). This conclusively demonstrates that the binding of FRMD8 to iRhom2 does not require phosphorylation of iRhom2. However, it is still formally possible that phosphorylation of iRhom2 affects FRMD8 binding specifically at the cell surface. This change cannot be detected by analysing the entire iRhom2 pool, which is primarily localised in the early secretory pathway. Therefore, we cannot exclude that the phosphorylation state of the relatively small cell surface pool of iRhom2 regulates the interaction with FRMD8.</p><p>Consistent with our current results, we reported previously that iRhom2 lacking the entire N-terminus is not sufficient to support ADAM17-mediated shedding in iRhom1/2-deficient cells, although it can promote ER-to-Golgi trafficking of ADAM17 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Grieve et al., 2017</xref>). Complementary to the conclusion that iRhom N-termini are regulatory, the core TMD binding function of iRhoms depends on their membrane-embedded region (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Grieve et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Cavadas et al., 2017</xref>). A picture therefore begins to emerge of iRhoms having a modular structure, with a core, highly conserved TMD recognition domain in the membrane (and perhaps the lumen), regulated by a more variable N-terminal domain that can integrate cytoplasmic signals.</p><p>In light of the growing value of therapeutics that block TNFα signalling, and the wider potential of modulating a wide range of ADAM17 substrates, it is tempting to speculate that the cytoplasmic N-termini of iRhoms could provide potential new drug target opportunities. For example, the limited expression of iRhom2 makes it a theoretically attractive anti-inflammatory target (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Issuree et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Lichtenthaler, 2013</xref>). iRhom2 knockout mice are broadly healthy, beyond defects in TNFα and type I interferon signalling that are only apparent upon challenge by bacterial and viral infections (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">McIlwain et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Luo et al., 2016</xref>). Our work now implies that the interface between FRMD8 and iRhoms might be a useful target. This is supported, at least in principle, by our observation that even in cells with complete loss of FRMD8, there is still a low level of mature ADAM17 at the cell surface, and consequently residual TNFα shedding. Even very efficient pharmacological blocking of the FRMD8/iRhom interaction would not, therefore, fully abolish inflammatory responses, potentially reducing side effects. Consistent with this idea, mice with a hypomorphic mutation in ADAM17 (termed ADAM17<sup>ex/ex</sup>) show that even only 5% of normal ADAM17 expression is sufficient to rescue many aspects of the loss of function phenotype (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Chalaris et al., 2010</xref>). Moreover, a recent study has shown that reducing ADAM17 levels has great pharmaceutical potential: reduced levels of ADAM17 in the <italic>Adam17<sup>ex/ex</sup></italic> mouse limits colorectal cancer formation and any residual tumours are low-grade dysplasias (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">Schmidt et al., 2018</xref>).</p><p>In conclusion, our work demonstrates the cellular and physiological significance of FRMD8 binding to iRhoms, and how it stabilises the iRhom/ADAM17 sheddase complex at the cell surface. It also reinforces the picture that has begun to emerge of ADAM17 not acting alone but instead being supported by at least two other regulatory proteins that act as subunits of what is effectively an enzyme complex. This concept would help to explain how the activity of such a powerful and versatile – and therefore potentially dangerous – shedding enzyme is controlled with necessary precision. The next steps in fully revealing the role of FRMD8 will be to analyse the phenotypic consequences of its loss in mice, which should allow us to understand how the roles of FRMD8 in ADAM17 activation, Wnt signalling, and any other potential functions, are integrated. Notwithstanding these physiological questions, the work described here already provides a basis for beginning to investigate the potential of targeting the FRMD8/iRhom interface for modulating the release of ADAM17 substrates.</p></sec><sec id="s4" sec-type="materials|methods"><title>Materials and methods</title><table-wrap id="keyresource" position="anchor"><label>Key resources

Your article has been reviewed by 3 peer reviewers, including Christopher G Burd as the Reviewing Editor, and the evaluation has been overseen by Ivan Dikic as the Senior Editor.</p><p>The reviewers have discussed the reviews with one another and the Reviewing Editor has drafted this decision to help you prepare a revised submission.</p><p>Summary:</p><p>In this study, Kunzel et al. identify FRMD8 as a previously unrecognized regulator of ADAM17 TNF shedding activity. It is shown that FRMD8 associates with ADAM17 and iRhom2 to form what appears to be a tripartite complex. Loss of FRMD8 by siRNA or genome editing results in a reduction in the level of mature ADAM17 and this can be rescued by Bafilomycin and NH4Cl. Physiological studies using human iPSC-derived macrophages and mice indicate that physiological ADAM17-mediated shedding is impaired by loss FRMD8. Overall, this is a superb study that will make an important contribution to the understanding of ADAM17 function in inflammatory signaling.</p><p>Essential revisions:</p><p>1) The reviewers feel that the functional relevance of a ternary complex of FRMD8, iRhom, and ADAM17 has not been adequately demonstrated. The experiments make a strong case showing that interaction between FRMD8 and iRhoms is essential for mutual stabilization of each protein, but the relevance to ADAM17 is less directly shown. It is shown that over-expression of FRMD8 or iRhom leads to an increase in the amount of the other protein, but the effect on ADAM17 level and processing/activation were not addressed. Does the amount of mature ADAM17 increase by overexpression of FRMD8, iRhom, or both together? The reviewers felt that this is important to bolster the nature of and functional relevance of the complex.</p><p>2) The conclusion that FRMD8 prevents lysosome-mediated degradation of mature ADAM17 is inferred from the recovery of mature ADAM17 protein level by bafilomycin and NH4Cl, but it is never directly demonstrated that ADAM17 (or iRhom) is delivered to the lysosome. This could be easily addressed by comparing immunofluorescence patterns of ADAM17 and a lysosome resident in treated cells.</p><p>3) Please add a statement (1-2 sentences) about the phenotype of the FRMD8 knock-out mice: if the phenotype differs from ADAM17-/- or iRhom2-/- mice it becomes clear that FRMD8 has additional functions.</p></body></sub-article><sub-article article-type="reply" id="SA2"><front-stub><article-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.35012.024</article-id><title-group><article-title>Author response</article-title></title-group></front-stub><body><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>1) The reviewers feel that the functional relevance of a ternary complex of FRMD8, iRhom, and ADAM17 has not been adequately demonstrated.

Below, we describe the experiments performed:</p><p>- We used our genetic KO cell lines to perform a series of pairwise interaction assays and show that 1) iRhom2 and FRMD8 can bind to each other in ADAM17 KO cells, 2) ADAM17 and iRhom2 bind one another in FRMD8 KO cells, but 3) there is no interaction between ADAM17 and FRMD8 in iRhom1/2 DKO cells. Overall, this shows that the recruitment of FRMD8 to the iRhom2 N-terminus is independent of ADAM17 binding (new Figure 4).</p><p>- Moreover, we have now mapped the specific region within iRhom2 for FRMD8 binding (Figure 3C) and found it to be between amino acids 201 and 300 in the N-terminus of iRhom2.</p><p>- Using this specific FRMD8 binding mutant (iRhom2<sup>∆201-300</sup>), we investigated the functional relevance of FRMD8 binding to iRhom2 and to ADAM17 – and show that the loss of FRMD8 binding to iRhom2 inhibits ADAM17-dependent shedding and also fails to rescue levels of mature ADAM17 in iRhom1/2 DKO cells (Figure 3D, E).</p><p>- In addition, we performed experiments that show the overexpression of FRMD8 leads to increased localisation of iRhom2 at the plasma membrane. This is direct, as an iRhom2 mutant that cannot bind to FRMD8 does not display enhanced localisation at the cell surface (Figure 5A, B).</p><p>- Importantly, these FRMD8 overexpression data highlighted that FRMD8 may stabilise iRhom2/ADAM17 at the cell surface. To test this, we directly fused FRMD8 to iRhom2 – and analysed both its localisation and the localisation of ADAM17. In doing so, we found that the localisation of iRhom2 and ADAM17 closely follow one another, in a FRMD8-dependent manner (Figure 5C-E). More specifically, constitutive recruitment of FRMD8 to iRhom2 led to increased cell surface levels of ADAM17. These new data nicely complement our previous data that show reduced cell surface levels of ADAM17 (Figure 2D/9D, E) and iRhom2 (Figure 7A/8B/9D, E) in various FRMD8 KO contexts.</p><p>- We have also shown that constitutive recruitment of FRMD8 leads to increased stability of iRhom2; these data were mirrored by the observation that lack of FRMD8 binding decreased iRhom2 stability (Figure 7—figure supplement 1). The functional relevance to ADAM17 is demonstrated by the new data that show the specific lack of FRMD8 binding causes ADAM17 instability (Figure 3E), leading to lysosomal delivery and degradation (Figure 6F, G).</p><p>- As requested, we performed shedding assays to analyse the effect of FRMD8 overexpression of the activity of ADAM17. Unexpectedly, the overexpression of FRMD8 led to a decrease in ADAM17-dependent shedding of EGFR ligands, relative to wild-type (see <xref ref-type="fig" rid="respfig1">Author response image 1</xref>). We have an explanation for this but have decided not to include it in the revised manuscript. Our previous work has shown iRhoms can promote the degradation of EGFR ligands (Zettl et al., 2011, Cell). Our ADAM17 shedding assays rely on the overexpression of AP-tagged EGFR ligands. As FRMD8 increases the total level of iRhoms (shown throughout this manuscript), this will also trigger degradation of the AP-tagged EGFR ligands, confounding this assay. Further experiments are currently underway to address this delicate balance between iRhom-driven EGFR ligand degradation vs. shedding by iRhom2/ADAM17, but this additional complexity needs further study and will also confuse readers, given that the separate degradation function of iRhoms (which we are extensively studying) is much less appreciated.</p><fig id="respfig1"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.35012.022</object-id><label>Author response image 1.</label><caption/><graphic mime-subtype="jpeg" mimetype="image" xlink:href="elife-35012-resp-fig1-v2"/></fig><p>- Overall, the data described thus far strengthen our conclusion that iRhom2 is a regulatory subunit of ADAM17 – and that FRMD8 regulates ADAM17's cell surface localisation and stability (this conclusion is further strengthened by the additional data submitted in response to reviewer comment #2).</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>2) The conclusion that FRMD8 prevents lysosome-mediated degradation of mature ADAM17 is inferred from the recovery of mature ADAM17 protein level by bafilomycin and NH4Cl, but it is never directly demonstrated that ADAM17 (or iRhom) is delivered to the lysosome. This could be easily addressed by comparing immunofluorescence patterns of ADAM17 and a lysosome resident in treated cells.</p></disp-quote><p>We include new data that clearly demonstrate the delivery of iRhom2/ADAM17 to LAMP1-positive lysosomal structures in the absence of FRMD8 recruitment. These data now form a new Figure 6 that also includes the bafilomycin/NH<sub>4</sub>Cl data.</p><p>- First, we have shown that upon treatment with bafilomycin, a substantial pool of wild-type iRhom2 accumulates in lysosomes (Figure 6A, C).</p><p>- The lack of FRMD8 recruitment to iRhoms enhances their level in LAMP1-positive lysosomes (Figure 6B, D).</p><p>- Under the same conditions, ADAM17 also appears to be delivered to lysosomes (Figure 6F).</p><p>- Overall, these data clearly demonstrate enhanced lysosomal delivery of the iRhom/ADAM17 sheddase complex in the absence of FRMD8 recruitment. Complementing this, additional imaging data show FRMD8 recruitment enhances the cell surface localisation of iRhom/ADAM17 (new Figure 5) as described in the response to reviewer comment #1.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>3) Please add a statement (1-2 sentences) about the phenotype of the FRMD8 knock-out mice: if the phenotype differs from ADAM17-/- or iRhom2-/- mice it becomes clear that FRMD8 has additional functions.</p></disp-quote><p>We have now further described our FRMD8 KO mice in terms of viability, fertility and quantified effects of FRMD8 KO in mice on ADAM17/iRhoms level. The phenotype of FRMD8 KO mice is weaker than the complete loss of ADAM17 or both iRhoms. A detailed physiological and pathological characterisation of FRMD8 KO mice is on-going and we consider it to be beyond the scope of this manuscript. We now compare the FRMD8 KO to the ADAM17ex/ex mouse in the discussion, and comment on their similar phenotypes. If the similarity in phenotype is true, it interestingly places FRMD8 as a potential regulator of colorectal cancer formation.</p></body></sub-article></article>
