mechanisms remain unclear. Since its advent, three major theories have been proposed: (1) DBS inhibits the STN and basal ganglia output; (2) DBS antidromically activates motor cortex; and (3) DBS disrupts firing dynamics within the STN. Previously, stimulation-related electrical artifacts limited mechanistic investigations using electrophysiology. We used electrical artifact-free GCaMP fiber photometry to investigate activity in basal ganglia nuclei during STN DBS in parkinsonian mice. To test whether the observed changes in activity were sufficient to relieve motor symptoms, we then combined electrophysiological recording with targeted optical DBS protocols. Our findings suggest that STN DBS exerts its therapeutic effect through the disruption of movement-related STN activity, rather than inhibition or antidromic activation. These results provide insight into optimizing PD treatments and establish an approach for investigating DBS in other neuropsychiatric conditions.</p></abstract><kwd-group kwd-group-type="author-keywords"><kwd>Parkinson's disease</kwd><kwd>basal ganglia</kwd><kwd>electrophysiology</kwd><kwd>calcium imaging</kwd><kwd>deep brain stimulation</kwd><kwd>subthalamic nucleus</kwd></kwd-group><kwd-group kwd-group-type="research-organism"><title>Research organism</title><kwd>Mouse</kwd></kwd-group><funding-group><award-group id="fund1"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution>Aligning Science Across Parkinson's</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>ASAP-020529</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Nelson</surname><given-names>Alexandra B</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund2"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000002</institution-id><institution>National Institutes of Health</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>F31 NS110329</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Schor</surname><given-names>Jonathan S</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund3"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000002</institution-id><institution>National Institutes of Health</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>K08 NS081001</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Nelson</surname><given-names>Alexandra B</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund4"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000002</institution-id><institution>National Institutes of Health</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>R01NS101354</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Nelson</surname><given-names>Alexandra B</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><funding-statement>The funders had no role in study design, data collection and interpretation, or the decision to submit the work for publication.</funding-statement></funding-group><custom-meta-group><custom-meta specific-use="meta-only"><meta-name>Author impact statement</meta-name><meta-value>In a mouse model of Parkinson's disease, deep brain stimulation of the subthalamic nucleus disrupts movement-related neural activity in parallel with relieving motor symptoms.</meta-value></custom-meta></custom-meta-group></article-meta></front><body><sec id="s1" sec-type="intro"><title>Introduction</title><p>The basal ganglia are a group of interconnected subcortical structures long believed to control movement through modulation of neuronal firing. This rate-based model posits that reductions in basal ganglia output (globus pallidus interna [GPi] and substantia nigra pars reticulata [SNr]) facilitate movement. According to this model, the loss of dopaminergic input to the basal ganglia in Parkinson’s disease (PD) leads to pathological increases in GPi/SNr firing and impaired movement. Dopamine replacement therapies, such as with dopamine agonists or the dopamine precursor levodopa, reduce GPi/SNr firing in both PD patients and animal models (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Hutchinson et al., 1997</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">Levy et al., 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">Lozano et al., 2000</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib46">Papa et al., 1999</xref>), suggesting they may act by restoring normal firing rates. Given these findings and the rate model, it may seem paradoxical that deep brain stimulation (DBS) of the subthalamic nucleus (STN), an intrinsic basal ganglia nucleus with predominantly excitatory projections to GPi/SNr, is one of the most effective treatments for PD (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Hickey and Stacy, 2016</xref>).</p><p>Investigations into how STN DBS impacts STN, GPi, and SNr activity have yielded conflicting results, and thus, how STN DBS exerts its therapeutic effects remains unclear. However, three major theories have been suggested (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Chiken and Nambu, 2014</xref>): (1) STN DBS <italic>inhibits</italic> STN activity, consistent with the rate model; (2) STN DBS bypasses basal ganglia output by antidromically <italic>exciting</italic> cortical neurons projecting to the STN; or (3) STN DBS <italic>disrupts</italic> movement-related activity in the STN. Supporting (1), focal STN lesions relieve motor symptoms of PD (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Andy et al., 1963</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Bergman et al., 1990</xref>), and some groups have observed inhibition of STN, GPi, or SNr firing during DBS (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Filali et al., 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib41">Moran et al., 2011</xref>). However, other groups have observed excitation in these structures (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Hashimoto et al., 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib48">Reese et al., 2011</xref>). Supporting (2), antidromic activation of primary motor cortex (M1) during STN DBS has been observed in rodents and in humans (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">Li et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib40">Miocinovic et al., 2018</xref>), and optical stimulation of hyperdirect M1 neurons relieves motor symptoms in parkinsonian mice (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Gradinaru et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib51">Sanders and Jaeger, 2016</xref>). However, recent evidence in nonhuman primates (NHPs) shows antidromic M1 activation during electrical STN DBS to be both variable and transient, suggesting this pathway may not be the primary mechanism of STN DBS (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Johnson et al., 2020</xref>). Supporting (3), correlations have been found between parkinsonian motor symptoms and signals such as local field potential (LFP) oscillations (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Kühn et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib55">Stein and Bar-Gad, 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib63">Wingeier et al., 2006</xref>) and bursting (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib45">Pan et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib66">Zhuang et al., 2018</xref>). Despite these observations, it has been difficult to distinguish between these possible mechanisms using electrophysiology, or to causally link observed changes in pattern and rhythm with improvements in behavior, in part due to large DBS-related electrical artifacts in recordings near the DBS site.</p><p>Here, we used the genetically encoded calcium indicator GCaMP to enable region- and cell type-specific (and electrical artifact-free) optical recording of neural activity in three basal ganglia circuit nodes (STN, SNr, and M1) in a mouse model of STN DBS for PD. Surprisingly, we found that STN DBS <italic>increased</italic> activity in the STN and the SNr (in conflict with the rate model), and though DBS also altered hyperdirect pathway M1 activity, these changes did not correlate strongly with motor improvement. Furthermore, M1 lesions did not eliminate the therapeutic benefit of STN DBS. Finally, we found that DBS abolished stereotyped patterns of STN activity around movement onset. An optical stimulation protocol that similarly attenuated this activity pattern was sufficient to improve movement, suggesting that disruption of movement-related STN activity may be a core therapeutic mechanism of STN DBS. Together, our results suggest that STN DBS causes specific disruptions in motor signals at the level of the STN, broadening our understanding of how the basal ganglia mediates motor control.</p></sec><sec id="s2" sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><sec id="s2-1"><title>STN GCaMP signals correlate with spiking measured by electrophysiology</title><p>To test whether DBS inhibits, excites, or disrupts its target neurons, we used fiber photometry to measure bulk fluorescence signals from the genetically encoded calcium indicator GCaMP6s. To validate this approach, we first sought to determine whether STN calcium signals could serve as proxy for neural activity. We injected the STN of VGlut2-Cre mice with AAVs encoding Cre-dependent GCaMP6s, limiting expression to glutamatergic STN neurons. We then performed simultaneous whole-cell current-clamp recordings and fluorescence imaging of STN neurons in ex vivo slices to compare firing rate and intracellular calcium signals (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1A–C</xref>). Neurons were driven to spike with intracellular current pulses at frequencies ranging from 10 to 200 Hz in 1 min epochs, which evoked rhythmic spiking at these frequencies (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1D–E</xref>). Calcium, as measured by changes in GCaMP6s fluorescence, similarly increased during firing at 10–200 Hz (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1F–G</xref>). In a subset of recordings, we assessed GCaMP6s signals in response to a range of lower firing frequencies (10–60 Hz) or higher frequencies (up to 200 Hz). Again, STN neurons showed rhythmic spiking that matched the frequency of pulsatile stimulation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1E</xref>, insets), and calcium signals correlated with firing rates up to about 100 Hz, and were variable between 100 and 200 Hz (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1G</xref>, inset). As some groups have speculated that high-frequency DBS may cause some neurons to enter depolarization block, we also tested the firing and calcium signals associated with constant current (‘square wave’) stimulation. During such stimulation, STN neurons fired only transiently, appearing to enter depolarization block (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1D–E</xref>). Under these circumstances, evoked calcium signals fell between those associated with 10 and 50–60 Hz spiking (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1F–G</xref>). These experiments suggest that the relationship between spiking and GCaMP calcium signals may break down at very high firing frequencies, or under conditions of forced depolarization block. However, at more moderate firing frequencies, GCaMP calcium signals correlate with STN firing.</p><fig-group><fig id="fig1" position="float"><label>Figure 1.</label><caption><title>Subthalamic nucleus (STN) GCaMP signals correlate with spiking measured by electrophysiology.</title><p>(<bold>A–G</bold>) Combined ex vivo electrophysiological and calcium imaging recordings in STN neurons.

To address this question, we recorded neural activity in vivo in two sets of parkinsonian animals, using either electrophysiology or GCaMP fiber photometry. We rendered mice parkinsonian through unilateral injection of 6-hydroxydopamine (6-OHDA) in the medial forebrain bundle (MFB, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1A</xref>). In one group of parkinsonian mice, we implanted a 16-channel electrode array in the ipsilateral STN (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1H</xref>). In a second group of parkinsonian VGlut2-Cre mice, we injected Cre-dependent GCaMP6s and implanted an optical fiber in the ipsilateral STN (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1I</xref>). As observed in prior studies (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Bové and Perier, 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Campos et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Carvalho et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib59">Ungerstedt, 1968</xref>), 6-OHDA-treated mice showed both decreased movement velocity (1.3±0.1 cm/s parkinsonian vs. 3.1±0.4 cm/s healthy, p=8.23 × 10<sup>–5</sup>) and an ipsilesional rotational bias (p=1.40 × 10<sup>–3</sup>) when compared to healthy mice (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1B</xref>). Additionally, movement velocity and rotation bias did not differ significantly between parkinsonian mice with and without STN implants (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1B</xref>, p=0.66 for velocity, p=0.97 for rotation), suggesting that local, implant-related STN tissue disturbance did not alter gross movement parameters. We then aligned single-unit spiking activity and fiber photometry signal to movement starts (defined as a transition from velocity &lt;0.5 to &gt;2 cm/s) in both sets of mice (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1K–L</xref>). STN single units showed baseline firing rates of approximately 5–10 spikes/s (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1K</xref>), well within the linear range for GCaMP6s (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1G</xref>, inset). The firing of STN units showed a marked change in firing rate around movement onset, increasing just prior to, and peaking just following movement initiation (approximately 1 spike/s over the baseline rate). Population calcium signals showed a similar increase around movement onset, but lagged the rise in single-unit firing rate by ~1 s, likely due to the slower kinetics of GCaMP6s (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">Markowitz et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1L</xref>). To determine whether this movement-related activity was also present in the STN of healthy animals, we used a similar fiber photometry approach, targeting GCaMP to STN glutamatergic neurons (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1J</xref>). Healthy animals tended to move at greater average velocity, but using the same event selection criteria, we aligned STN calcium signals to movement onset. As in parkinsonian mice, we found that in healthy animals, STN GCaMP signals increased around movement onset (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1M</xref>). Thus, STN calcium signals and electrophysiology appear to capture a slightly time-shifted, but qualitatively similar increase in activity when aligned to behavior. Together, these ex vivo and in vivo experiments show a correlation between spiking and GCaMP6s signal, and therefore support the utility of fiber photometry as a proxy for neuronal activity in the context of STN DBS.</p></sec><sec id="s2-2"><title>STN DBS consistently increases STN activity</title><p>The direct impact of STN DBS on STN neural activity remains unclear: some studies indicate that STN DBS decreases STN firing rates, while recordings in downstream nuclei indicate STN activity may increase. To address whether STN DBS increases or decreases overall STN activity, we injected parkinsonian VGlut2-Cre mice with Cre-dependent GCaMP6s and implanted them with both an STN DBS device and an optical fiber (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2A–B</xref>; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s1">Figure 2—figure supplements 1A</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s2">2A</xref>). We applied DBS using 12 different parameter sets, holding pulse width and amplitude constant (60 µs and 200 µA, respectively) and varying frequency (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="supp1">Supplementary file 1</xref>, table 2). Consistent with our previous findings in the same mouse model (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib52">Schor and Nelson, 2019</xref>), many different parameter sets were effective, across a broad frequency range. Grouping these parameter sets by stimulation frequency, we found that average movement velocity was increased by low- (5–40 Hz), medium- (60–100 Hz), and high-frequency (120–180 Hz) STN DBS (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s2">Figure 2—figure supplement 2</xref>; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s1">Figure 3—figure supplement 1</xref>; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s1">Figure 4—figure supplement 1</xref>). We found that 60–100 and 120–180 Hz DBS produced similar benefits in movement velocity, so focused on 60 and 100 Hz stimulation for subsequent analyses; 60 or 100 Hz stimulation improved multiple movement metrics (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s1">Figure 2—figure supplement 1B-K</xref>).

We subsequently used movement velocity as the primary behavioral outcome measure for STN DBS. We then measured changes in STN activity in vivo in response to treatment with STN DBS. Surprisingly, in parallel with its impact on movement velocity (p=7.11 × 10<sup>–9</sup>), STN DBS at 60 Hz caused a significant increase in STN calcium signals (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2C–D</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s2">Figure 2—figure supplement 2B</xref>; p=1.19 × 10<sup>–7</sup>).

To directly compare STN DBS and dopamine replacement therapy using the same readout of STN activity, we administered levodopa in the same set of mice.

In these sessions, though all mice showed improvements in movement (p=1.66 × 10<sup>–3</sup> for velocity, p=3.91 × 10<sup>–3</sup> for rotation bias), changes in STN calcium were variable (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2G–H</xref>; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s2">Figure 2—figure supplement 2D</xref>). In some mice, STN activity decreased, while in others it increased: STN activity was not significantly changed across the entire group (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2H</xref>; p=0.90). Injection with saline did not improve movement parameters, nor did it produce significant changes in STN activity (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s2">Figure 2—figure supplement 2E-F</xref>; p=0.084). As levodopa does not produce electrical artifacts like DBS, we were able to directly compare its effects on calcium signals and the gold standard measure of neural activity, single-unit electrophysiology. In parallel with its impact on movement (p=3.13 × 10<sup>–4</sup> for velocity, p=9.77 × 10<sup>–4</sup> for rotation bias), levodopa caused a modest, though significant, decrease in STN firing rates (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2I–J</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s2">Figure 2—figure supplement 2G</xref>; p=0.029).

In addition, STN DBS is likely to cause changes in the activity of nearby axons, and thus may have complex downstream effects. Therefore, while we did not observe inhibition at the level of the STN during STN DBS, we wondered if it might still produce inhibition at the level of the primary basal ganglia output nucleus in rodents, the SNr. To determine how SNr activity responds to STN DBS, we injected either VGAT-Cre mice with Cre-dependent GCaMP6s in the SNr (N=6 mice) or wild-type (WT) mice with synapsin- GCaMP6s in the SNr (N=2 mice) and implanted them with an STN DBS device and an optical fiber in the SNr (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3A</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s1">Figure 3—figure supplement 1A</xref>).

To assess whether STN DBS increases activity of hyperdirect M1 neurons, we imaged hyperdirect pathway neurons using a retrograde viral strategy. We injected the STN of parkinsonian mice with one of two retrograde viruses encoding Cre recombinase (CAV2-Cre or rAAV2-Cre-mCherry), and injected M1 with Cre-dependent GCaMP6s (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4A</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s1">Figure 4—figure supplement 1A-B</xref>).

We then implanted an optical fiber in M1 and a DBS device in the STN.

Despite the consistent therapeutic effects of 60 Hz STN DBS (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4C</xref>, top), hyperdirect M1 calcium responses were surprisingly variable: some mice showed increases, while the calcium signal in other mice decreased or did not change (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4C</xref>, bottom; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s1">Figure 4—figure supplement 1C</xref>; p=0.084).

Given the observed lag between electrophysiology and bulk GCaMP signals seen by other groups (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">Markowitz et al., 2018</xref>), and in our own data (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1</xref>), we expected that changes in calcium signals might appear to lag the behavior itself. Across all STN DBS conditions, movement velocity increased with a rise time of 2.8±0.6 s after stimulation commenced. For each condition, we calculated the difference in rise time between the calcium signal and movement velocity as an indicator of whether these two signals changed on a similar timescale. STN calcium signals during 60 or 100 Hz STN DBS lagged movement velocity by 2.6±1.1 s. We observed a relatively similar lag comparing SNr calcium signals to the corresponding movement velocity traces (3.7±1.8 s). However, the lag in hyperdirect M1 activity was markedly longer (17.3±3.1 s). These kinetics indicate STN and SNr activity evolve on a timescale similar to the movement benefits of STN DBS, while hyperdirect M1 activity, as measured by fiber photometry, evolves more slowly.</p></sec><sec id="s2-5"><title>Surgical removal of M1 does not abolish therapeutic benefit of STN DBS</title><p>Though overall hyperdirect pathway activity was not a strong predictor of the therapeutic effects of STN DBS, these findings do not exclude the possibility that the hyperdirect pathway mediates motor benefits. We next asked if M1 was required for the therapeutic effects of STN DBS on movement.

As previously noted, in parkinsonian mice, STN activity increases around movement initiation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6A</xref>, left), consistent with the idea that STN neurons encode some aspects of movement. To determine whether this encoding was altered during DBS, we aligned neural activity to movement starts during stimulation epochs.

To test these possibilities, we chose 13 parameter combinations (varying in current amplitude, frequency, and pulse width, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="supp1">Supplementary file 1</xref>, table 3) from a set that we had used previously to evaluate the impact of STN DBS parameters on behavioral benefit in the mouse model (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib52">Schor and Nelson, 2019</xref>). In the same mice, we measured locomotor activity and calcium signals while delivering STN DBS at each of these 13 parameter combinations. Behavioral responses were divided into two groups, depending on whether the DBS-induced movement velocity averaged greater or less than 1 cm/s (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6B</xref>). We labeled the first group ‘high effect’ stimulation (8 combinations) and the second group ‘low effect’ stimulation (5 combinations). We then assessed STN movement-related activity during each stimulation type, as measured by the peak-to-trough deflection of the movement-aligned STN photometry signal (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6C</xref>, shaded inset). Interestingly, across 13 stimulation parameter sets, this neural activity metric showed a bimodal distribution. With low effect stimulation parameters, STN calcium signals increased around movement onset, as they did during baseline (no stimulation) periods. This resulted in a peak-to-trough change in calcium that was &gt;1 (z-scored dF/F; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6C</xref>). However, during high effect stimulation, STN calcium signals changed minimally around movement onset, with a peak-to-trough change of &lt;1 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6C</xref>). When comparing STN activity across all high effect vs. all low effect stimulation parameters rather than individually, the normal movement-related increase in STN activity was strongly suppressed only during highly effective stimulation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6D</xref>; p=1.48 × 10<sup>–11</sup> for pre vs. high, p=0.54 for pre vs. low).

However, it remains critical to determine which changes in neural activity causally contribute to the therapeutic mechanism(s) of STN DBS. In our experiments using electrical STN DBS, we observed changes in overall STN activity <underline>and</underline> activity around movement initiation, making it difficult to determine which change is more likely to mediate the benefit. To disentangle the behavioral impacts of changing STN rate vs. timing, we replaced electrical DBS/optical recording with optical DBS/electrical recording techniques.

We then assessed STN single-unit firing during two optical stimulation paradigms in freely moving parkinsonian mice: ‘constant’ and ‘pulsatile’ (50 Hz) blue light stimulation (both 3 mW). As has been observed previously in anesthetized STN recordings in rats (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib65">Yu et al., 2020</xref>), STN neurons showed both excitatory and inhibitory responses to optical stimulation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7B–E</xref>; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7s1">Figure 7—figure supplement 1B-C</xref>).

During cell-attached patch-clamp recordings of STN in ex vivo slices (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7s1">Figure 7—figure supplement 1D</xref>), pulsatile (50 Hz) blue light stimulation increased STN firing fairly consistently (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7s1">Figure 7—figure supplement 1E-F</xref>; p=0.033), while constant illumination evoked more variable changes in spiking (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7s1">Figure 7—figure supplement 1G-H</xref>; p=0.63).

In different test sessions, we stimulated with either constant or pulsatile blue light in 1 min epochs. We predicted that continuous stimulation, which did not alter the trajectory of STN firing around movement initiation, would not produce benefits, while pulsatile stimulation, which greatly attenuated STN these dynamics, would increase movement velocity. During constant illumination, neither STN-ChR2 nor STN-eYFP mice showed a significant increase in movement velocity or other metrics such as percent time moving or change in rotation bias (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7H–I</xref>; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7s1">Figure 7—figure supplement 1I-K</xref>; p=0.30 for ChR2 movement velocity, p=0.66 for eYFP movement velocity).

STN-eYFP mice did not show a significant change in movement velocity during 50 Hz stimulation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7s1">Figure 7—figure supplement 1N</xref>; p=0.81). These results demonstrate that although therapeutic electrical and optical STN DBS produce quite distinct changes on the rate of STN activity, they both disrupt movement-related STN dynamics. Moreover, they suggest that disrupting movement-related STN dynamics is sufficient to ameliorate parkinsonian motor deficits, making it a candidate mechanism for electrical STN DBS.</p></sec></sec><sec id="s3" sec-type="discussion"><title>Discussion</title><p>We combined a recently developed mouse model of electrical STN DBS for PD with electrical artifact-free GCaMP fiber photometry to investigate three major theories surrounding the mechanism of electrical STN DBS: (1) STN DBS inhibits STN and SNr activity; (2) STN DBS acts through antidromic activation of hyperdirect M1 neurons; and (3) STN DBS acts through disrupting neuronal activity patterns within the STN. Using bulk calcium signals as a surrogate marker for neural activity, we found that STN DBS increases rather than decreases STN and SNr activity, and M1 activation does not seem to be necessary for therapeutic STN DBS, rendering the first two theories less likely. In support of the third theory, we observed that therapeutic electrical stimulation abolished patterned STN activity around movement onset and used optical manipulations to demonstrate that attenuating STN dynamics may be causal in the motor benefits of DBS.</p><p>In this study, we used fiber photometry with GCaMP6s to examine how neural activity changes during STN DBS. A recent study demonstrated technical feasibility of using in vivo calcium imaging with electrical STN DBS (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib58">Trevathan et al., 2021</xref>), but ours is the first to use this approach to link DBS-mediated physiological changes to behavior in freely moving parkinsonian animals. Moreover, our study is one of the first to use fiber photometry in deep basal ganglia nuclei, and to compare these signals with in vivo single-unit electrophysiology. This approach had several advantages, as well as limitations. The key advantage was the ability to obtain recordings free from electrical artifacts. Artifacts had been a major obstacle in prior electrophysiological studies, particularly in studying the effect of DBS on neurons in the target structure, such as the STN or GPi. A second advantage was the ability to use cell type- or projection-specific techniques. For example, the use of retrograde viruses allowed us to target the direct projections from primary motor cortex to STN (hyperdirect pathway), a population of significant interest in PD and DBS. Though STN and SNr are relatively homogeneous structures, with regard to major neurotransmitters (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib54">Smith and Parent, 1988</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib60">Walaas and Fonnum, 1979</xref>), future studies could use GCaMP and genetics to target either specific STN/SNr projections or novel cell types within them (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Kita and Kitai, 1987</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">Liu et al., 2020</xref>). There are several limitations of our approach over electrophysiology, however. One is its temporal resolution. While traditional single-unit electrophysiology can detect individual action potentials, measuring calcium with GCaMP provides an integrated signal arising from multiple spikes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Chen et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib50">Sabatini, 2019</xref>). Fiber photometry further averages signals across a population of neurons, and from multiple neuronal compartments (dendrites and somata), bringing additional caveats. Fiber photometry signals may increase in response to greater firing in the population as a whole, or in response to increased synchronization across the population. Recent work comparing neuronal firing and fiber photometry (with simultaneous multi-unit electrophysiology and fiber photometry) in the striatum suggests that while an initial phase of calcium signal correlates well with firing, fiber photometry signals are also more prolonged, which may represent dendritic calcium influx associated with backpropagation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Legaria et al., 2021</xref>). For a combination of reasons, fiber photometry signals are slow and often lag changes in spiking. Given this temporal lag, it is difficult to establish whether DBS-associated changes in GCaMP signal arise directly from electrical stimulation, network activation, sensory feedback, or all of the above. Nonetheless, our activity measurements with photometry showed striking similarities to activity measurements using single-unit electrophysiology, over both short (movement-aligned activity) and long (responses to systemic levodopa administration) timescales. There thus appears to be some correspondence between the two recording techniques. In the future, voltage indicators with high signal-to-noise that are compatible with deep imaging, as well as miniscope imaging of many single neurons simultaneously, may allow detection of single spikes and help increase the information obtained in optical recordings during DBS.</p><p>Our observation that therapeutic STN DBS increases activity at the level of the STN and SNr, rather than inhibiting it, is at odds with traditional rate-based models of basal ganglia function. In fact, previous STN DBS electrophysiological studies in parkinsonian primates have had conflicting results: some show increased basal ganglia output activity during STN DBS, while others observe local STN inhibition (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Filali et al., 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib41">Moran et al., 2011</xref>). Single-unit data in rodents is more limited, but analyses of pattern at both the single-unit and LFP level in one study suggest that the therapeutic benefit of STN DBS may be independent from overall changes in STN firing rate (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib66">Zhuang et al., 2018</xref>). Thus, it is possible that treatments that increase (e.g. DBS) or decrease STN firing (e.g. optical inhibition [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib64">Yoon et al., 2014</xref>] or levodopa) may be therapeutic. Some discrepancies in existing physiological data may arise from the imperfect process of removing STN DBS artifacts from electrophysiological recordings, especially in structures like STN and SNr that have high spontaneous firing rates. Others may relate to differences among animal models of PD.</p><p>Electrical STN DBS may increase the activity of STN neurons via several physiological mechanisms. As electrical stimulation has previously been suggested to preferentially recruit axons (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">McIntyre et al., 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">McIntyre and Grill, 1999</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib44">Nowak and Bullier, 1998</xref>), DBS may drive antidromic spiking of STN neurons via stimulation of efferent STN axons, as well as drive STN spiking via activation of incoming excitatory axons. Depending on the proximity of the electrode to neural elements, it may drive STN activity through local activation of dendrites or cell bodies, as well. Increased SNr spiking may be driven by orthodromic activation of STN to SNr excitatory axons, or potentially by more complex network effects. The time resolution of fiber photometry and the time lag between STN and SNr activation (on average about 1 s) with this method cannot exclude polysynaptic effects. It is important to note that fluorescence GCaMP signals are correlative, and the behavior of mice during therapeutic STN DBS changes markedly. The change in movement may itself drive changes in STN and SNr activity, for example through sensory feedback to the basal ganglia. The recorded signals in the STN and SNr may therefore be both a cause and/or an effect of increased movement.</p><p>Though we observed modulation of hyperdirect M1 neurons during STN DBS, this modulation did not correlate well with therapeutic effects. While this is suggestive that the hyperdirect pathway is less important for the therapeutic effect of STN DBS, differences in the physiological properties of M1 projection neurons, as compared to STN and SNr neurons, might have contributed to the late-developing changes in M1. The spatial relationship of the DBS electrodes to the M1-STN projection, and the targeting of GCaMP to the hyperdirect pathway are likely to vary across animals, which may have also contributed to variability in hyperdirect pathway signals during DBS. In addition, antidromic activation of hyperdirect pathway neurons may have more complex polysynaptic effects, via local interneurons or collaterals to different areas, such as the zona incerta (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Kita and Kita, 2012</xref>). However, removal of M1 did not abolish the therapeutic benefit of STN DBS, leading us to conclude that hyperdirect M1 activation may not play a central role. The discrepancy between our conclusions and those of previous studies has a number of potential explanations. While past mouse studies have used optogenetic stimulation as a proxy for electrical STN DBS (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Gradinaru et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib51">Sanders and Jaeger, 2016</xref>), we used electrical stimulation in an effort to more closely model what is observed in PD patients (our eventual use of optogenetic stimulation was directly informed by our observations during electrical stimulation). The former approach identifies manipulations that are sufficient to relieve parkinsonian motor symptoms, while the latter identifies changes that correlate with a specific therapy. Thus, while optogenetic stimulation may reveal that changing neural activity in a variety of ways can relieve parkinsonism in mice, it is difficult to extrapolate which of these changes actually occur during electrical STN DBS. In other words, two therapies that have similar behavioral effects may not have the same mechanism of action. In addition, while hyperdirect pathway neurons did not seem to be crucial for the benefits of STN DBS in mice, they may play a more important role in other species, particularly given differences in the connectivity of motor cortical areas and STN in primate species (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Devergnas and Wichmann, 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib40">Miocinovic et al., 2018</xref>). Indeed, it is important to note that animal models of PD, such as the 6-OHDA model, are different from PD, and caution is required in extrapolating our results to DBS in PD patients. Additionally, STN DBS relieves both gross and fine motor symptoms in PD, but here we have only assessed gross motor outcomes. It is possible that hyperdirect pathway modulation contributes more strongly to fine motor benefits of STN DBS.</p><p>In the absence of therapeutic manipulations, we found that STN neurons in parkinsonian mice show an increase in activity around movement initiation, as measured with single-unit electrophysiology or bulk calcium imaging with GCaMP fiber photometry. Using electrophysiological methods, similar observations have been made in the STN of healthy NHPs and cats (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Cheruel et al., 1996</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib61">Wichmann et al., 1994</xref>). Less is known about what drives this increase, though candidates include excitatory input from hyperdirect M1 neurons (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib47">Polyakova et al., 2020</xref>), inhibitory input from the globus pallidus pars externa (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Chu et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Kovaleski et al., 2020</xref>), and/or increased synchronization among STN neurons. As we found that disruption of STN movement-related activity may play a role in alleviating parkinsonian symptoms, identifying the physiological sources of this signal will likely be an important task in future research.</p><p>Our observation that movement-related STN activity patterns are altered during STN DBS may relate to previous work showing changes in firing patterns or network synchrony during STN DBS. It has previously been postulated that rate-independent aspects of neural activity, such as within-neuron firing pattern or between-neuron synchronization, may drive PD symptoms and represent key markers of therapeutic interventions (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Hammond et al., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Little and Brown, 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib62">Wichmann, 2019</xref>). Many other groups have observed increased oscillations throughout the basal ganglia in parkinsonian animal models and in humans, which may resolve with therapeutic treatment (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">de Hemptinne et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Halje et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib42">Moran et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib53">Shimamoto et al., 2013</xref>). In fact, one group studying healthy NHPs has even observed positive modulation during movement in pallidal cells, similar to what we observed during movement starts in STN neurons, and which was similarly interrupted in a subset of pallidal neurons during STN DBS (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib67">Zimnik et al., 2015</xref>). The difficulty, though, has been in establishing a causal link between changes in these patterns during DBS and improvement in behavior. Our ability to not only observe but also to trigger these changes through optogenetic manipulation helps fill this critical gap. Additional causal links might be investigated further in the future using a combination of optical and electrical methods, building on the approach introduced here.</p><p>Though it facilitated our use of cell type-specific methods and GCaMP, a key potential caveat of our study is the mouse model of PD. First, the 6-OHDA model causes focal, rapid, and in this case nearly complete loss of dopaminergic neurons and their projections. In contrast, PD causes neurodegenerative changes in multiple brain areas over many years. Though many key physiological features of PD are similar in toxin-based models of parkinsonism (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Bové and Perier, 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Campos et al., 2013</xref>), others may be distinct based on the pattern and tempo of neurodegeneration. In addition, electrical stimulation may have different impacts in the small mouse brain as compared to the human brain. Though electrical stimulation is unlikely to respect the borders of brain nuclei in either species, the small size of the target region (STN) in the mouse brain increases the likelihood that fibers in adjacent areas are recruited by DBS. Comfortingly, our observation that the therapeutic effects of electrical STN DBS in the mouse fall off rapidly below the average current amplitude (200 µA) and vary according to the STN region targeted (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib52">Schor and Nelson, 2019</xref>) match well with human data and suggest some specificity in the volume of tissue activated (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Greenhouse et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib57">Tommasi et al., 2008</xref>).</p><p>For practical reasons, in order to test the physiological and behavioral effects of a wide variety of stimulation parameters (both subtherapeutic and therapeutic), we delivered short (1 min) epochs of stimulation. These short epochs may not capture the longer term changes in neural activity expected in PD patients, where continuous high-frequency stimulation is the current clinical standard. Reducing this concern, many DBS benefits indeed evolve rapidly in PD patients, as in the mouse model (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Hristova et al., 2000</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib56">Temperli et al., 2003</xref>), and our previous work demonstrates consistent behavioral improvement in the model even across longer timescales (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib52">Schor and Nelson, 2019</xref>).</p><p>Excitingly, our observation that non-canonical changes in STN activity confer therapeutic benefit in a mouse model of PD suggests a wider therapeutic space for the treatment of PD. Many therapeutic approaches to PD have been predicated on the idea that inhibition of hyperactive basal ganglia nuclei is required for therapeutic benefit, but our findings, as well as recent work using closed-loop DBS (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Bouthour et al., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Johnson et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib49">Rosin et al., 2011</xref>) indicate non-rate-based alterations in activity can improve movement. In addition, our work linking neural activity to behavior in STN DBS for PD may inform the application of DBS to other neuropsychiatric disorders. To rationally apply DBS to other conditions, such as addiction or Tourette’s syndrome, it is critical to know how electrical stimulation might impact the underlying neural circuitry of disease. We hope that our work will promote future inquiries into the therapeutic potential of DBS.</p></sec><sec id="s4" sec-type="materials|methods"><title>Materials and methods</title><table-wrap id="keyresource" position="anchor"><label>Key resources table</label><table frame="hsides" rules="groups"><thead><tr><th align="left" valign="bottom">Reagent type (species) or resource</th><th align="left" valign="bottom">Designation</th><th align="left" valign="bottom">Source or reference</th><th align="left" valign="bottom">Identifiers</th><th align="left" valign="bottom">Additional information</th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td align="left" valign="bottom">Genetic reagent (<italic>Mus musculus</italic>, C57Bl/6)</td><td align="left" valign="bottom">VGluT2-Cre</td><td align="left" valign="bottom">JAX</td><td align="left" valign="bottom">RRID IMSR_JAX:028863</td><td align="left" valign="bottom">Hemizygous</td></tr><tr><td align="left" valign="bottom">Genetic reagent (<italic>Mus musculus</italic>, C57Bl/6)</td><td align="left" valign="bottom">VGAT-Cre</td><td align="left" valign="bottom">JAX</td><td align="left" valign="bottom">RRID IMSR_JAX:016962</td><td align="left" valign="bottom">Hemizygous</td></tr><tr><td align="left" valign="bottom">Strain, strain background (<italic>Mus musculus</italic>, C57Bl/6)</td><td align="left" valign="bottom">C57Bl/6J</td><td align="left" valign="bottom">JAX</td><td align="left" valign="bottom">RRID IMSR_JAX:000664</td><td align="left" valign="bottom">Wild-type</td></tr><tr><td align="left" valign="bottom">Genetic reagent (AAV)</td><td align="left" valign="bottom">AAV1-Syn-Flex-GCaMP6s-WPRE-SV40</td><td align="left" valign="bottom">Addgene</td><td align="left" valign="bottom">RRID:<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://identifiers.org/RRID/RRID:Addgene_100845">Addgene_100845</ext-link></td><td align="left" valign="bottom">Diluted 1:8 in normal saline</td></tr><tr><td align="left" valign="bottom">Genetic reagent (AAV)</td><td align="left" valign="bottom">AAV2<sub>retro</sub>-Cre-mCherry</td><td align="left" valign="bottom">Addgene</td><td align="left" valign="bottom">RRID:<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://identifiers.org/RRID/RRID:Addgene_55632">Addgene_55632</ext-link></td><td align="left" valign="bottom">Undiluted</td></tr><tr><td align="left" valign="bottom">Genetic reagent (CAV)</td><td align="left" valign="bottom">CAV-Cre</td><td align="left" valign="bottom">Montpellier</td><td align="left" valign="bottom">CAV-Cre</td><td align="left" valign="bottom">Undiluted</td></tr><tr><td align="left" valign="bottom">Genetic reagent (AAV)</td><td align="left" valign="bottom">AAV5-DIO-ChR2-eYFP</td><td align="left" valign="bottom">Addgene</td><td align="left" valign="bottom">RRID:<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://identifiers.org/RRID/RRID:Addgene_20298">Addgene_20298</ext-link></td><td align="left" valign="bottom">Diluted 1:2 in normal saline</td></tr><tr><td align="left" valign="bottom">Genetic reagent (AAV)</td><td align="left" valign="bottom">AAV5-DIO-eYFP</td><td align="left" valign="bottom">UNC Vector Core</td><td align="left" valign="bottom">No. order # available</td><td align="left" valign="bottom">Undiluted</td></tr><tr><td align="left" valign="bottom">Other</td><td align="left" valign="bottom">16-Channel 7 mm fixed electrode array</td><td align="left" valign="bottom">Innovative Neurophysiology</td><td align="left" valign="bottom">No. catalog #</td><td align="left" valign="bottom">Tungsten microwire array</td></tr><tr><td align="left" valign="bottom">Other</td><td align="left" valign="bottom">Master8</td><td align="left" valign="bottom">AMPI</td><td align="left" valign="bottom">RRID:<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://identifiers.org/RRID/RRID:SCR_018889">SCR_018889</ext-link></td><td align="left" valign="bottom">Stimulus pattern generator</td></tr><tr><td align="left" valign="bottom">Antibody</td><td align="left" valign="bottom">Anti-tyrosine hydroxylase (rabbit polyclonal)</td><td align="left" valign="bottom">Pel-Freez</td><td align="left" valign="bottom">Order # P40101-150<break/>RRID:<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://identifiers.org/RRID/RRID:AB_2617184">AB_2617184</ext-link></td><td align="left" valign="bottom">lot #: AJ0818B;

LED intensity was adjusted to yield an output of 3 mW at the slice. Light was delivered in 1 min epochs, at 50 Hz, 3 ms pulse width or continuously. Stimulation lasted for 1 min and was preceded and followed by 30 s of recording without stimulation.</p><p>For simultaneous electrophysiology and GCaMP6s imaging, current-clamped neurons were stimulated (0.5–1 nA) to elicit action potentials. Stimulation occurred at 10, 20, 40, 50 or 60, and 100 or 120 Hz (100 μs pulse-width); or was delivered as a long single square wave of constant current for 1 min, preceded and followed by 30 s without stimulation. During the duration of each 2 min trial GCaMP fluorescence was either acquired through one-photon or two-photon microscopy. One-photon experiments used a 473 nm light (TTL-controlled LED, Olympus, paired with GFP filter, Chroma) delivered to the slice at &lt;1 mW, with GCaMP6s fluorescence captured using an imaging camera attached to the microscope (QI Retiga Electro). For two-photon microscopy, a two-photon source (Coherent Ultra II) was tuned to 810 nm to identify GCaMP expressing neurons and tuned to 940 nm for calcium imaging. Epi- and transfluorescence signals were captured through a 40×, 0.8 NA objective paired with a 1.4 NA oil immersion condenser (Olympus) to photomultiplier tubes (H10770PA-40 PMTs, Hamamatsu). Data were collected in line scan mode (2–2.4 ms/line, including mirror flyback).</p><p>All ex vivo electrical recordings were passed through a 1 Hz high-pass filter to remove slow electrical drift and spikes were extracted using the findpeaks function in Matlab. All ex vivo optical recordings were first collapsed into a one-dimensional fluorescence time series by averaging the fluorescence of pixels within a defined region-of-interest. In one-photon recordings, this signal was further processed by fitting a double exponential and subtracting it to remove effects of signal bleaching.</p></sec><sec id="s4-10"><title>Optogenetic manipulations</title><p>A detailed protocol for optogenetic manipulations can be found at <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://doi.org/10.17504/protocols.io.4r3l2oybxv1y/v1">https://doi.org/10.17504/protocols.io.4r3l2oybxv1y/v1</ext-link>. Prior to optical stimulation experiments, animals were habituated to tethering with custom lightweight patch cables (Precision Fiber Products and ThorLabs) coupled to an optical commutator (Doric Lenses) in the open field for 30 min per day, over 1–2 days. Optical stimulation sessions consisted of five 1 min stimulation periods, each preceded and followed by 1 min of no stimulation, for a total of 11 min. TTL-controlled (Master8, A.M.P.I.) blue laser light (488 nm, 3 mW, Shanghai Laser and Optics Century) was delivered in pulse trains (3 ms, 50 Hz) or continuously. Behavior was rated by an observer blinded to the injected construct (ChR2-eYFP or eYFP).</p></sec><sec id="s4-11"><title>Histology and microscopy</title><p>A protocol for immunohistochemistry can be found here: <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://doi.org/10.17504/protocols.io.14egn7nezv5d/v1">https://doi.org/10.17504/protocols.io.14egn7nezv5d/v1</ext-link>. Mice were terminally anesthetized with IP ketamine (200 mg/kg) and xylazine (40 mg/kg). For mice with an implanted STN DBS device or multielectrode array, the site of stimulation or recording was marked with a solid state, direct current Lesion Maker (Ugo Basile). Mice were then transcardially perfused with 4% paraformaldyde (PFA), the brain was dissected from the skull and fixed overnight in 4% PFA, and then was placed in 30% sucrose at 4°C for 2–3 days. Brains were then cut into 50 μm sagittal sections on a freezing microtome (Leica). To confirm dopamine depletion, tissue was immunostained for tyrosine hydroxylase (TH). Stitched multi-channel fluorescence images were taken on a Nikon 6D conventional widefield microscope at 4–10×, using custom software (UCSF Nikon Imaging Center) to confirm virus expression, fiber placement, and STN DBS placement.</p></sec><sec id="s4-12"><title>Group allocation and blinding</title><p>The order in which each mouse received electrical stimulation during optical recording experiments was randomized daily, as was the type of stimulation administered. Mouse order and stimulation type was also randomized during optogenetic experiments. For optical manipulations, VGluT-Cre-positive littermates were randomized to eYFP or ChR2-eYFP injection. The experimenter was blinded to experimental group (eYFP vs ChR2-eYFP) during behavioral experiments.</p></sec><sec id="s4-13"><title>Inclusion/exclusion criteria</title><p>If the number of ipsilesional TH-positive SNc neurons were &gt;5% of the contralateral (unlesioned) side, the animal was excluded from all analyses. Animals that did not show strong virus expression, proper optical fiber placement (within target structure or &lt;0.2 mm above), and/or proper STN DBS device placement (within STN) were excluded from further analysis. If DBS leads developed a short, further DBS experiments were terminated, but levodopa experiments were continued.</p><p>A short developed in one mouse in the STN DBS/SNr fiber photometry cohort, such that only levodopa experiments could be performed. We failed to deliver 1 of the 30 DBS parameter combinations in one mouse from the STN DBS/M1 hyperdirect fiber photometry cohort, so no 100 Hz DBS data were included for this mouse. Across all photometry cohorts, 4 mice were excluded due to insufficient GCaMP expression and/or improper targeting of the optical fiber, resulting in no detectable GCaMP signal (4 of 30 mice). Across optical stimulation cohorts, 2 mice were excluded due to insufficient eYFP or ChR2-eYFP expression (2 of 22 optical stimulation mice). One mouse in the STN in vivo electrophysiology cohort (1 of 4) and 1 mouse from the SNr in vivo electrophysiology cohort (1 of 4) were excluded due to a lack of clearly isolated single units.</p></sec><sec id="s4-14"><title>Sample size determination, quantification, statistical analysis, and replication</title><p>For in vivo fiber photometry experiments, no similar studies had been performed by which to estimate effect size. We performed small pilot experiments in each recorded brain region to determine the mean and standard deviation of GCaMP signals in these regions. Effect sizes were estimated from these pilots, or from similarly designed and published electrophysiological studies. The sample size was calculated using 0.90 power to detect a significant difference, two-sided nonparametric comparisons, and alpha of 0.05. Sample sizes for ex vivo experiments, in vivo electrophysiology, and in vivo optical stimulation were calculated using a similar approach, but based on variance and effect sizes from previous experiments conducted in the lab using similar methods as well as published studies from other laboratories.</p><p>All data are expressed as mean ± standard error of the mean (SEM). For all bar graphs for electrical stimulation, optogenetic, and slice experiments, the ‘stim’ or ‘laser’ bar was calculated by averaging all 1 min stimulation periods for each trial. The ‘pre’ and ‘post’ bars were calculated by averaging the 30 s before and 30 s after each stimulation period, respectively. For all bar graphs involving levodopa or saline, the ‘LD’ or ‘saline’ bar was calculated by averaging the 10 min between 30 and 40 min post injection for each trial. The ‘pre’ and ‘post’ bars were calculated by averaging the time period between 15 and 5 min before injection and between 125 and 135 min post injection, respectively, for each trial. Correlation between photometry signal and velocity (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s1">Figure 4—figure supplement 1E</xref>) was calculated using <italic>fitlm</italic> in Matlab. Rise time of velocity and calcium signals was calculated as the time it took from the onset of stimulation for the signal to first reach the mean value for that stimulation epoch. Movement starts were defined as events when the mouse’s movement velocity changed from less than 0.5 cm/s (maintained for at least 1 s) to more than 2 cm/s. Change in photometry signal or firing rate around movement starts (insets in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6D</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7F–G</xref>) was calculated by subtracting the average fiber signal or firing rate during 1 s preceding movement start from the average fiber signal or firing rate during 1 s following movement start.</p><p>All data on which a repeated measures one-way ANOVA (rmANOVA) was performed were tested for normality using a Kolmogorov-Smirnov test. Nonparametric tests (Friedman test, Wilcoxon signed-rank, Wilcoxon rank-sum) were used in all other cases (see <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="supp1">Supplementary file 1</xref>, table 1 for full details). For rmANOVAs and Friedman tests, a Tukey HSD post hoc analysis was applied to correct for multiple comparisons. Data was considered statistically significant for p&lt;0.05.</p><p>Multiple cohorts were used in each experiment, and findings were reliably reproduced among all subjects. In vivo optical recordings for each brain region were conducted using at least three cohorts of animals. Optogenetic experiments were conducted with three cohorts of animals. Electrophysiology experiments were conducted with at least two cohorts of animals. M1 lesion experiments were conducted with two cohorts of animals.</p></sec></sec></body><back><sec sec-type="additional-information" id="s5"><title>Additional information</title><fn-group content-type="competing-interest"><title>Competing interests</title><fn fn-type="COI-statement" id="conf1"><p>No competing interests declared</p></fn></fn-group><fn-group content-type="author-contribution"><title>Author contributions</title><fn fn-type="con" id="con1"><p>Conceptualization, Data curation, Formal analysis, Funding acquisition, Investigation, Methodology, Validation, Visualization, Writing - original draft, Writing - review and editing</p></fn><fn fn-type="con" id="con2"><p>Investigation</p></fn><fn fn-type="con" id="con3"><p>Investigation, Methodology, Visualization</p></fn><fn fn-type="con" id="con4"><p>Investigation</p></fn><fn fn-type="con" id="con5"><p>Investigation</p></fn><fn fn-type="con" id="con6"><p>Investigation</p></fn><fn fn-type="con" id="con7"><p>Conceptualization, Investigation, Methodology, Writing - review and editing</p></fn><fn fn-type="con" id="con8"><p>Conceptualization, Funding acquisition, Investigation, Project administration, Resources, Supervision, Validation, Writing - review and editing</p></fn></fn-group><fn-group content-type="ethics-information"><title>Ethics</title><fn fn-type="other"><p>This study was performed in accordance with the recommendations in the Guide for the Care and Use of Laboratory Animals of the National Institutes of Health.

Your article has been reviewed by 3 peer reviewers, and the evaluation has been overseen by a Reviewing Editor and John Huguenard as the Senior Editor. The following individual involved in review of your submission has agreed to reveal their identity: Dieter Jaeger (Reviewer #3).</p><p>The reviewers have discussed their reviews with one another, and the Reviewing Editor has drafted this to help you prepare a revised submission.</p><p>Essential revisions:</p><p>The reviewers have a good consensus that this paper has many strengths and was thoughtfully done, a few major concerns need to be addressed:</p><p>1) it is well-known that clinical DBS employed at least 120 Hz stimulation. But the present study utilized suboptimal frequencies (60 and 100Hz only) to address the mechanism. The loss of correspondence between spiking and calcium at the highest stimulation frequencies produces concern regarding the interpretation of the calcium signals with the &quot;high effect stim&quot; which includes multiple stim protocols with frequency &gt; 100Hz. Added controls with higher frequency stimulation could improve the interpretability of the GCaMP signals for DBS at higher frequencies</p><p>2) In addition to establishing baseline firing dynamics in the STN in parkinsonian mice, identification of the movement-related calcium activity in a healthy control mouse would establish whether therapeutic DBS shifts the activity in the direction of healthy STN firing activity (Figure 1B). This could enhance the relevance of the finding that the movement-related neural dynamics in the STN are abolished with DBS.</p><p>3) Both Reviewers 1 and 3 suggested employing a miniscope approach to identify the spatial patterns of STN neuronal activities. However, both reviewers also indicated that this would be a whole new study from scratch. Therefore, please take this into consideration when you extend the discussion on the limitation of using fiber photometry.</p><p>4) The reviewers also made suggestions on how to enhance the clarity of the paper. In addition, the limitation of fiber photometry should be thoroughly discussed.</p><p><italic>Reviewer #1 (Recommendations for the authors):</italic></p><p>With reference to the comments described in the public review, the authors are recommended to:</p><p>1) Replace CGaMP fibre photometry approach by mini-endoscopy technique that could provide single cell level calcium activity. Only using such an approach can provide good enough temporal resolution at single neuron level in reporting firing pattern and synchrony of neurons and their correlation with behavioral effect of DBS while at the same time avoid electrical stimulation artefacts.</p><p>2) Report the difference between healthy control and PD mice with respect to calcium activities (preferably via miniscope rather than fibre photometry) in the target areas (STN, SNr, M1) studied, to provide a clear picture of what normal calcium activities in healthy animals are what pathological changes are PD animals.</p><p>3) Apply clinically relevant DBS frequency (120Hz or above) in addressing the mechanisms of DBS.</p><p>4) Provide videos of the STN stimulation protocol such that readers have a good idea how the animals behave before and after 6-OHDA lesion and under DBS (and preferably in control animals too). The reason for this is that the short (1 min) and robust triggering of movement under DBS gives an impression that the animals were driven to move involuntarily rather than facilitating their natural voluntary movements. If so, the DBS cannot be regarded as therapeutic. Given that only a single parameter was used in this study and other motor abilities are not reported (of which the authors should also include as much as possible), this is considered an important point.</p><p>5) In relation to 4) above, what was the effect of removing M1 on the general motor ability of the animal? Would the effect in any way compromise the interpretation of the study of M1 removal in arguing against the antidromic hypothesis?</p><p><italic>Reviewer #2 (Recommendations for the authors):</italic></p><p>In the abstract and introduction, the 3 theories include one as &quot;inhibits STN output&quot; and the other as &quot;disrupts firing dynamics within the STN&quot;. The terminology of the latter could be made more specific to avoid overlap between these two.

But the present study utilized suboptimal frequencies (60 and 100Hz only) to address the mechanism.</p></disp-quote><p>We thank the reviewer for bringing up these important points, which may not have been clear from the manuscript. First of all, though DBS has traditionally been targeted to higher frequencies (120-200 Hz), accumulating clinical evidence suggests that lower frequencies can be quite effective, particularly if the pulse width and/or amplitude are increased to compensate for the lower frequency of stimulation (Blumenfeld et al., 2017; Conway et al., 2021; Khoo et al., 2014; Moreau et al., 2008; Xie et al., 2015). Some studies suggest lower frequency stimulation (eg 60 Hz) might be particularly helpful for freezing of gait and other “axial” symptoms. For this reason, we think lower DBS frequencies are clinically relevant.</p><p>In the mouse model of STN DBS for Parkinson’s Disease, we previously showed that when pulse width and amplitude are fixed, therapeutic increases in movement velocity tended to increase with stimulation frequency from 15-120 Hz, but that low frequency stimulation could be as effective when paired with higher pulse width and/or amplitude (Schor and Nelson, 2019). In this same manuscript, we re-plotted previously published data on finger tapping in Parkinson’s Disease patients during DBS (Moro et al., 2002), and saw a similar effect. Together, these results suggest that DBS at moderate frequencies, such as 50-60 or 100 Hz, is clinically relevant in PD patients and therapeutic in the mouse model.</p><p>Based on our previous findings that moderate (60-100 Hz) frequency DBS was effective in the mouse model, and our plan to use optical tools, such as ChR2, which is known from ex vivo studies to have reduced spike fidelity starting around 60 Hz, but certainly above 100 Hz, we decided to highlight 50-60 (optical and electrical experiments, respectively) and 100 Hz DBS in the main figures. However, in the revised manuscript, we have included experiments using STN DBS with 12 different stimulation parameter sets, over a range of frequencies, while holding amplitude and pulse width fixed, including the higher frequencies that the reviewer points out are more commonly used in PD patients (Supplementary File 1b). As in our original paper on the STN DBS model, we found that many parameter combinations were effective, including some at lower frequencies. We have now included those data in new supplements: Figure 2—figure supplement 2D, Figure 3—figure supplement 1D, and Figure 4—figure supplement 1E. We have separated trials into three groups by DBS frequency: “Low” (5-40Hz), “Medium” (60-100 Hz) and “High” (120-180 Hz) for the analysis. In the supplementary figures, the behavioral effect of DBS on movement velocity is shown for each of these groups alongside the physiological effects on STN (Figure 2—figure supplement 2D), SNr (Figure 3—figure supplement 1D), and hyperdirect pathway activity (Figure 4—figure supplement 1D). The effects are qualitatively and quantitatively quite similar for “Medium” and “High” frequency stimulation. “Low” frequency stimulation produced clear, but more modest effects on movement velocity and neural activity, consistent with our previously published work in this model.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>(1b) The loss of correspondence between spiking and calcium at the highest stimulation frequencies produces concern regarding the interpretation of the calcium signals with the &quot;high effect stim&quot; which includes multiple stim protocols with frequency &gt; 100Hz. Added controls with higher frequency stimulation could improve the interpretability of the GCaMP signals for DBS at higher frequencies.</p></disp-quote><p>The reviewer brings up an excellent point. First, we want to clarify that the ex vivo GCaMP/whole-cell electrophysiology experiments performed in Figure 1A-G were meant to validate that STN neuron GCaMP fluorescence increases with higher rates of STN neuron spiking activity, rather than directly test how GCaMP fluorescence reflects different stimulation frequencies of DBS. In the ex vivo experiments, intracellular current pulses were applied to drive STN neurons at specific firing rates. These experiments did not deliver extracellular pulses like DBS, which presumably recruits many different circuit elements as well as cellular compartments. We do not know the frequencies of spiking that are elicited by different frequencies of electrical stimulation in vivo, as we have performed optical recordings in vivo. It is quite possible that 100 Hz electrical stimulation does not evoke 100 Hz spiking in vivo, and so on. We apologize for the confusion and have tried to clarify in the Results text the intent and methodology for the ex vivo experiments.</p><p>However, the reviewer makes an excellent suggestion to test the relationship of STN GCaMP fluorescence to STN spiking at higher firing rates. We have now performed additional combination ex vivo whole-cell electrophysiology/calcium imaging experiments, included in Figure 1E, G. First, we found that individual STN neurons can be driven with high frequency intracellular current injections to fire at correspondingly high firing rates (up to 200 Hz, Figure 1E inset). Second, in this group of neurons driven to fire at very high firing rates, there is increasing GCaMP fluorescence with higher firing rates up to 100 Hz (consistent with the data shown in the original manuscript), but in most cells there is a more modest increase in STN neuron GCaMP fluorescence between 100-200 Hz spiking.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>2) In addition to establishing baseline firing dynamics in the STN in parkinsonian mice, identification of the movement-related calcium activity in a healthy control mouse would establish whether therapeutic DBS shifts the activity in the direction of healthy STN firing activity (Figure 1B). This could enhance the relevance of the finding that the movement-related neural dynamics in the STN are abolished with DBS.</p></disp-quote><p>In response to the reviewer’s suggestion, we have performed additional in vivo STN GCaMP fiber photometry experiments in healthy mice (Figure 1J, M; N=5). These animals, as expected, move at higher average velocities than do 6-OHDA treated animals. In healthy mice, as in the 6-OHDA-treated mice, we observed an increase in STN calcium signal (Figure 1M, top) when aligned to movement starts (Figure 1M, bottom). This observation is in line with several published papers, in other species and with other methodologies, showing movement-related increases in STN activity in healthy animals (eg Cheruel et al., 1996; Wichmann et al., 1994).</p><p>The reviewer was interested in the possibility that DBS might shift activity in the direction of “healthy” STN activity. For this possibility to be considered with calcium signals (as the reviewer suggested), there must be a difference between movement-related STN calcium signals in healthy vs 6-OHDA treated mice. Comparing the average normalized STN GCaMP fiber photometry signals in Figure 1L and 1M qualitatively, the 6-OHDA group shows a dip in STN activity just before movement starts, which was not seen in healthy animals. The duration of the increase in STN signal after movement starts also appears to be longer in healthy animals. However, we are reluctant to make any direct comparisons between these groups, for several reasons. As the absolute value of the GCaMP signal varies from mouse to mouse, based on GCaMP viral expression, precise fiber placement, among other factors, it is challenging, even with normalization, to make direct comparisons across mice. In addition, though we have aligned to movement starts in both healthy and 6-OHDA treated animals, movement kinematics are likely to differ between healthy and 6-OHDA-treated animals. Even the overall velocity trajectory is quite different, as seen in the bottom panels of Figure 1L and 1M. This could contribute to the different shapes of the fiber photometry signal, as well. We suspect that in future work, to determine how the movement-related STN activity might differ between healthy and parkinsonian animals, it would be best to perform STN single-unit electrophysiology, in which an absolute value (firing rate/pattern) can be determined and permits cross-animal comparisons. The interpretation of such findings would also benefit from comparison of similar movement trajectories in the two groups, either through a more fine-grained analysis of spontaneous movement, or even use of a trained behavior. Based on the findings we have now included in the paper, however, we do not believe we can make a strong argument that STN DBS is restoring a “healthy” pattern of movement-related STN activation, just that STN DBS suppresses movement-related STN activity as measured by GCaMP.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>3) Both Reviewers 1 and 3 suggested employing a miniscope approach to identify the spatial patterns of STN neuronal activities. However, both reviewers also indicated that this would be a whole new study from scratch. Therefore, please take this into consideration when you extend the discussion on the limitation of using fiber photometry.</p></disp-quote><p>We appreciate the reviewers’ suggestions regarding the use of miniscope calcium imaging to address questions related to those we examined. We thank the reviewers for agreeing that though such an approach provides the opportunity to examine individual cellular Ca signals and is likely to be quite interesting, such experiments would entail a brand new study and would not be feasible to develop in our lab on a reasonable timescale. We have, in keeping with many of the suggestions by reviewers, devoted additional space to discussing the limitations of fiber photometry, above and beyond those associated with GCaMP, and the potential benefits of future single-cell resolution calcium imaging in conjunction with DBS.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>4) The reviewers also made suggestions on how to enhance the clarity of the paper. In addition, the limitation of fiber photometry should be thoroughly discussed.</p></disp-quote><p>As noted above, in the revised manuscript we have devoted more space in the Discussion to the caveats of GCaMP and fiber photometry. We appreciate the reviewers’ additional suggestions and they are noted in response to each specific critique/suggestion below.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Reviewer #1 (Recommendations for the authors):</p><p>With reference to the comments described in the public review, the authors are recommended to:</p><p>1) Replace CGaMP fibre photometry approach by mini-endoscopy technique that could provide single cell level calcium activity. Only using such an approach can provide good enough temporal resolution at single neuron level in reporting firing pattern and synchrony of neurons and their correlation with behavioral effect of DBS while at the same time avoid electrical stimulation artefacts.</p></disp-quote><p>We agree with the Reviewer that single-cell calcium imaging, in addition to its ability to resolve individual cells, could provide additional information about the spatial and temporal features of STN calcium responses to electrical DBS. We appreciate this suggestion, but as noted above, repeating all the experiments with a miniscope approach would essentially entail a brand-new study. It would require optimizing this technique with electrical DBS, developing computational analysis of these signals, and running scores of additional animals and analyzing their data (we are not currently performing miniscope recordings in our lab). Even if a new trainee with expertise in this area were available, we estimate it would take us 2+ years to gather the requisite data. Finally, current GCaMP indicators combined with miniscope techniques in freely moving animals have single-cell resolution, and are likely to reduce or eliminate some of the confounds associated with collecting calcium signals from the entire cell https://www.biorxiv.org/content/10.1101/2021.01.20.427525v1, but to our knowledge still cannot achieve single-spike resolution, particularly in a tonically active nucleus such as the STN. This approach would certainly offer higher temporal resolution than fiber photometry, but still not at the level of spikes with current technology. We hope that in the future, improvements in calcium and/or voltage indicators usable in deep structures like the STN in freely moving animals will permit a closer approximation to the information in electrophysiology, as this would truly get to some of the Reviewer’s critical questions regarding neural patterning and synchrony.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>2) Report the difference between healthy control and PD mice with respect to calcium activities (preferably via miniscope rather than fibre photometry) in the target areas (STN, SNr, M1) studied, to provide a clear picture of what normal calcium activities in healthy animals are what pathological changes are PD animals.</p></disp-quote><p>We share the reviewer’s interest in the differences between healthy and 6-OHDA treated animals in the target areas. There are limitations in comparing the absolute value of calcium signals across animals, but we have now performed STN GCaMP fiber photometry in healthy animals and see a rise in normalized GCaMP signals at movement onset (Figure 1M) roughly similar to that in 6-OHDA treated mice. This observation mirrors the increase in firing rate (as measured with electrophysiology) at movement initiation we observed in parkinsonian mice (Figure 1K) and has been reported in other species (Cheruel et al., 1996; Wichmann et al., 1994).</p><p>To the specific question of what is different in the physiology of basal ganglia neurons between healthy and parkinsonian states (independent of DBS), we think that single-unit electrophysiology is likely the most sensitive and interpretable approach, as it gives single-cell and spike-level resolution, and provides an absolute activity level (firing rate). There are a large number of careful electrophysiological studies in nonhuman primates, rats, and increasingly, mice, that have provided these comparisons in the STN, SNr and M1, though mostly with the one-cell-at-a-time approach. In the future, we anticipate high density electrophysiological probes can give an even better sense of the differences in single-cell and ensemble basal ganglia activity between healthy and parkinsonian animals.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>3) Apply clinically relevant DBS frequency (120Hz or above) in addressing the mechanisms of DBS.</p></disp-quote><p>The Reviewer makes an excellent point, in that most clinical DBS in Parkinson’s Disease is performed at high frequencies. However, there is accumulating evidence that lower frequencies of DBS can be clinically effective (see comments under Essential Revisions/Critique 1a).</p><p>In response to the Reviewer’s suggestion, we have now included data from STN, SNr, M1 GCaMP fiber photometry in parkinsonian mice with DBS at 12 different parameter combinations, ranging from 5 Hz to 180 Hz in stimulation frequency. We observed qualitatively similar findings in terms of fiber photometry signal across these combinations. We have now included analyses of different frequencies in this range with fixed pulse width and amplitude (Figure 2—figure supplement 2D, Figure 3—figure supplement 1D, and Figure 4—figure supplement 1E). See details under Essential Revisions/Critique 1a.</p><p>Though the frequency of stimulation in DBS does not necessarily match the frequency of STN firing, we have also performed additional ex vivo GCaMP validation experiments, up to a firing rate of 200 Hz (Figure 1E, G, insets). See details under Essential Revisions/Critique 1b.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>4) Provide videos of the STN stimulation protocol such that readers have a good idea how the animals behave before and after 6-OHDA lesion and under DBS (and preferably in control animals too). The reason for this is that the short (1 min) and robust triggering of movement under DBS gives an impression that the animals were driven to move involuntarily rather than facilitating their natural voluntary movements. If so, the DBS cannot be regarded as therapeutic. Given that only a single parameter was used in this study and other motor abilities are not reported (of which the authors should also include as much as possible), this is considered an important point.</p></disp-quote><p>We thank the reviewer for this comment and suggestion. We agree very large increases in movement could be pathological. Therapeutic DBS in human patients doesn’t make movement obligatory, but does increase spontaneous movement, and makes it more fluid and normal in speed when voluntarily initiated. Though we cannot easily distinguish voluntary versus involuntary movements in mice, we do observe that in a given mouse, during a single session of DBS (see <xref ref-type="fig" rid="sa2fig1">Author response image 1</xref>) some stimulation epochs are associated with substantial increases in movement velocity, others with modest increases (upper trace, arrowhead), and others with essentially no change (bottom trace, arrowheads). If a mouse wants to sit, DBS doesn’t seem to prevent that. [The dotted lines represent 2 SD above the mean velocity for that session.] We do not have paired videos from the same mouse before 6-OHDA treatment, after 6-OHDA treatment, and during DBS. We have collected videos shot from above the mouse during DBS sessions, including ON and OFF stimulation. However, we point the Reviewer to a video (shot from the side) associated with our previously published manuscript characterizing the mouse model of STN DBS for PD, which includes baseline, ON, and OFF periods. We used the identical DBS approach as used in this manuscript. <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://www.jci.org/articles/view/122390/sd/2">https://www.jci.org/articles/view/122390/sd/2</ext-link></p><fig id="sa2fig1" position="float"><label>Author response image 1.</label><graphic mimetype="image" mime-subtype="tiff" xlink:href="elife-75253-sa2-fig1-v2.tif"/></fig><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>5) In relation to 4) above, what was the effect of removing M1 on the general motor ability of the animal? Would the effect in any way compromise the interpretation of the study of M1 removal in arguing against the antidromic hypothesis?</p></disp-quote><p>The reviewer brings up an excellent point. Is motor function overall suppressed in parkinsonian animals after M1 lesions? Our primary metric, average locomotor velocity, ranged from 0.5-1 cm/sec across parkinsonian imaging cohorts shown in Figures 2 and 3, and baseline velocity was on the lower end of this range (approximately 0.5 cm/sec) in parkinsonian animals after M1 lesion (Figure 4). Despite baseline velocities on the lower end of what was seen in other cohorts, M1-lesioned mice showed improvement with STN DBS, supporting the idea that the hyperdirect pathway is not the only or primary pathway involved in the therapeutic effects of STN DBS in parkinsonian mice.</p><p>We did not perform assays of fine motor control in this study, so cannot address whether electrical STN DBS remediates fine motor control in 6-OHDA treated mice, nor whether our M1 lesions produced deficits in fine motor control. STN DBS in PD patients produces a number of benefits, including improvements in gross and fine motor control. First, it is possible that though M1 is not required for the gross motor benefits we observed in 6-OHDA treated mice, it would be required for improvements (if present) in fine motor assays. Second, the mouse brain is not the same as the human brain, and the 6-OHDA model is the not the same as Parkinson’s Disease; it remains quite possible that the hyperdirect pathway plays a more significant part in the therapeutic benefits of STN DBS in PD patients than in the mouse model. We appreciate the Reviewer raising these issues and have now expanded our discussion on the hyperdirect pathway and limitations in the interpretation of our results.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Reviewer #2 (Recommendations for the authors):</p><p>In the abstract and introduction, the 3 theories include one as &quot;inhibits STN output&quot; and the other as &quot;disrupts firing dynamics within the STN&quot;. The terminology of the latter could be made more specific to avoid overlap between these two. Maybe something like &quot;movement-related activity&quot; instead of &quot;firing dynamics&quot;.</p></disp-quote><p>We appreciate the Reviewer’s suggestion and agree that “firing dynamics” in this context is a little confusing, and have changed the Title to “Therapeutic Deep Brain Stimulation Disrupts Movement-Related Subthalamic Nucleus Activity in Parkinsonian Mice”. It is challenging to come up with a unifying phrase to encompass theories that STN DBS changes “dynamics”, as published work on this topic includes many papers using local field potential (LFP) as a readout, and mostly without aligning neural activity to motor output. However, we understand the concern, and have attempted to clarify the way we describe our own findings, which are specific to movement-related STN activity, as the Reviewer notes.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>The movement-related signal with in vivo electrophysiology and calcium imaging in 1J and 1K is described to be qualitatively similar due to the peak, but the time-course of the recovery from the peak is not addressed. This could affect further interpretability of the duration of changes in the calcium signals.</p></disp-quote><p>We appreciate the reviewer’s comment and have expanded our discussion of the temporal features of GCaMP/fiber photometry versus electrophysiological signals, as well as the movement-aligned increase in STN activity, in the Discussion. The decay of the movement-related increases in firing rate and calcium signal in (revised) Figures 1K and 1L are relatively similar (reaching baseline around 3 seconds later). However, as we now highlight in the discussion, recent work in the striatum using simultaneous multi-unit electrophysiology and GCaMP fiber photometry indicate that photometry signals can outlive spiking by a considerable period, perhaps due to calcium signals derived from the dendrites https://www.biorxiv.org/content/10.1101/2021.01.20.427525v1. This type of experiment has not been performed in the STN, but a similar phenomenon might be expected in most, if not all brain areas due to calcium influx in the dendritic arbors as a result of backpropagation.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>In making the claim that DBS and levodopa both improve movement, but affect the overall activity differentially, the firing activity response to levodopa is compared to the calcium signal in response to the DBS. This comparison across techniques seems weak, given the differential sensitivity discussed and potentially different mechanisms measured by the two techniques (Figure 2F, J).</p></disp-quote><p>At the time we designed our experiments, there were no similar experiments using in vivo calcium imaging in structures like the STN and SNr in parkinsonian mice, but there were numerous similar studies using single-unit electrophysiological recordings in parkinsonian nonhuman primates and rodents. We felt that given the very well-established effects of levodopa on firing rate/pattern in different basal ganglia nuclei, it would be helpful to show how GCaMP signals changed in response to this extensively studied manipulation. We reasoned the levodopa experiments would provide an additional layer of validation of the technique. However, we agree with the Reviewer that DBS and levodopa are likely to have different impacts on basal ganglia activity, and to relieve parkinsonian symptoms in different ways. In the revised manuscript, we have tried to clarify what can and cannot be compared between these two interventions.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>M1 lesion experiment, velocity scale reduced to 1cm/s (Figure 5B).

We chose 50 Hz because this was likely to be close to the ceiling light stimulation frequency that could be used with ChR2, based on ex vivo studies (see Figure 7—figure supplement 1D-H), but was relatively close to a highly effective electrical DBS frequency based on our previous work. We were not trying to achieve a specific STN firing rate or pattern with this frequency. We suspect there is nothing particularly special about 50 Hz, and indeed 50 Hz ChR2 stimulation achieves a wide variety of actual firing rates in STN neurons in vivo (Figure 7E, 7C).</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>The opposing effects of therapeutic electrical and optical DBS on the STN firing rate could be further explained with potential cell-type specific mechanisms of action.</p></disp-quote><p>We thank the reviewer for this comment. To clarify, we cannot measure the firing rate of STN neurons with any GCaMP methodology, and moreover fiber photometry reads out calcium signals across a population of neurons, including both their somata and dendrites. Despite some nonlinearities, based on ex vivo and in vivo validation experiments (Figure 1) we suspect that in some ranges of firing, there is a correlation between the two methodologies. The reviewer brings up an excellent point that we found electrical DBS tended to increase STN activity (as assayed with fiber photometry) while optical DBS tended (on average) to decrease STN activity. We interpret this to mean that the average rate of activity is not the unifying mechanism of action. Indeed, as the reviewer notes, these stimulation methods would be expected to recruit different circuit elements. Electrical stimulation preferentially recruits axons over dendrites and cell bodies, for example, and thus when applied to the STN would be expected to activate incoming and outgoing axons, as well as fibers of passage. In turn, such recruitment of axons could cause antidromic spiking in STN input regions (M1 cortex, GPe, etc), orthodromic activation of STN targets (SNr, GPe, GPi, etc), or effects in areas connected to the fibers of passage. Optical stimulation of ChR2-expressing glutamatergic STN cells, on the other hand, would be expected to specifically modulate the activity of cell bodies (as we have validated here with single-unit electrophysiology). By virtue of action potential propagation and synaptic release, optical stimulation would also be expected to modulate activity in the monosynaptic targets of glutamatergic STN neurons (SNr, GPe, GPi, etc), but should not (directly at least) regulate the activity of other regions sending inputs into or through the STN region. The differences in STN activity under these two distinct stimulation methods, thus, may reflect the differences in the cellular elements they recruit.</p></body></sub-article></article>
