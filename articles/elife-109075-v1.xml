response to changes in their environment. This phenomenon, termed fungal morphogenesis, is critical for fungi to survive and colonize diverse ecological niches and establish infections in a variety of hosts. Despite significant advancements in the field with respect to understanding the gene regulatory networks that control these transitions, the metabolic determinants of fungal morphogenesis remain poorly characterized. In this study, we uncover a previously uncharacterized, conserved dependency between central carbon metabolism and de novo biosynthesis of sulfur-containing amino acids that is critical for fungal morphogenesis in two key fungal species. Using a multidisciplinary approach, we demonstrate that glycolytic flux is crucial to drive fungal morphogenesis in a cAMP-independent manner and perturbation of this pathway leads to a significant downregulation in the expression of genes involved in de novo biosynthesis of sulfur-containing amino acids. Remarkably, exogenous supplementation of sulfur-containing amino acids robustly rescues the morphogenesis defect induced by the perturbation of glycolysis in both <italic>Saccharomyces cerevisiae</italic> and <italic>Candida albicans</italic>, underscoring the pivotal role of de novo biosynthesis of sulfur-containing amino acids as a downstream effector of morphogenesis. Furthermore, a <italic>C. albicans</italic> mutant lacking the glycolytic enzyme, phosphofructokinase-1 (Pfk1), exhibited significantly reduced survival within murine macrophages and attenuated virulence in a murine model of systemic candidiasis. Overall, our work elucidates a previously uncharacterized coupling between glycolysis and sulfur metabolism that is critical for driving fungal morphogenesis, contributing to our understanding of this conserved phenomenon.</p></abstract><abstract abstract-type="plain-language-summary"><title>eLife digest</title><p>Growing extra arms or tentacles, changing skin colour or texture – what sounds like the premise of a horror story is actually a common occurrence in nature. Many microscopic fungi can modify their shape to infect hosts and evade their immune defences. These organisms do not simply grow – they can alter their physical form depending on their environment. One moment, they are harmless, yeast-like cells, quietly living in the human gut; the next, they transform into long, thread-like filaments called hyphae that penetrate tissues and cause infections in animals and crops. Scientists call this extraordinary shape-shifting ability ‘fungal morphogenesis’.</p><p>While scientists have identified the genes involved in this process, the role of cellular metabolism has been less well established. Previous research suggests that the presence of glucose is important for fungal morphogenesis. But how this sugar influences this shape-shifting behaviour was not completely understood. Understanding what truly controls this process could uncover new ways to prevent harmful fungi from causing diseases in plants and animals.</p><p>To determine whether glucose merely supports fungal morphogenesis or truly drives this change, Shah et al. used baker’s yeast and a pathogenic yeast that causes thrush in humans. Both yeast species were grown under nitrogen-limited conditions, a known factor to trigger fungal morphogenesis. When glycolysis - the process that breaks down sugar molecules into energy - was blocked, neither species could shape-shift.</p><p>More detailed experiments showed that this was due to the need for glycolysis to produce sulfur-containing building blocks, such as amino acids, that support this transition. When these sulfur-containing building blocks were supplied from the outside, the fungi regained their ability to change shape – even under conditions compromising their ability to perform glycolysis.</p><p>This effect was observed in both yeast species, highlighting that this process must be conserved in potentially many yeast species. Blocking glycolysis disarms the pathogen, compromising its morphogenesis and rendering it vulnerable to host defence. This metabolic interference paves the way for a new class of precision antimicrobials that are both more potent in combating infections and less toxic to the infected host. Moreover, fungal morphogenesis has been implicated in causing resistance to existing antifungals. Therefore, targeting glycolysis will support the development of effective therapeutic strategies to increase the efficacy of existing antifungals.</p></abstract><kwd-group kwd-group-type="author-keywords"><kwd>fungal forphogenesis</kwd><kwd>glycolysis</kwd><kwd><italic>Saccharomyces cerevisiae</italic></kwd><kwd><italic>Candida albicans</italic></kwd><kwd>virulence</kwd></kwd-group><kwd-group kwd-group-type="research-organism"><title>Research organism</title><kwd><italic>S. cerevisiae</italic></kwd><kwd><italic>C. albicans</italic></kwd></kwd-group><funding-group><award-group id="fund1"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="ror">https://ror.org/0492wrx28</institution-id><institution>Indian Council of Medical Research</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>IIRPSG-2024-01-02717</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Varahan</surname><given-names>Sriram</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund2"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution>Anusandhan National Research Foundation</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>SRG/2023/000470</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Varahan</surname><given-names>Sriram</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund3"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="ror">https://ror.org/021wm7p51</institution-id><institution>Council of Scientific and Industrial Research</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>FTT070505</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Varahan</surname><given-names>Sriram</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund4"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="ror">https://ror.org/04reqzt68</institution-id><institution>DBT-Wellcome Trust India Alliance</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>IA/E/16/1/502996</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Varahan</surname><given-names>Sriram</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><funding-statement>The funders had no role in study design, data collection and interpretation, or the decision to submit the work for publication.

This inherent ability to rapidly adapt to the changes in their environment is essential for their survival and allows them to colonize diverse ecological niches, including various host organisms (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Gow et al., 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib42">Lin et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib60">Naranjo-Ortiz and Gabaldón, 2019</xref>). This conserved phenomenon of fungal morphogenesis encompasses a plethora of morphological forms, including pseudohyphae, hyphae, appressoria, and fruiting bodies to name a few (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib42">Lin et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib71">Riquelme et al., 2018</xref>). Importantly, these morphological transitions in various pathogenic fungal species significantly influence their interaction with the respective host, impacting their overall ability to cause persistent infections (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib56">Min et al., 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib93">Wang and Lin, 2012</xref>). Fungal morphogenesis is conserved across a plethora of fungal species and has profound implications with respect to fungal ecology, anti-fungal drug resistance, and pathogenicity across a spectrum of hosts (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Christensen, 1989</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib68">Puumala et al., 2024</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib79">Sexton and Howlett, 2006</xref>). Consequently, it has been a central focus of intense scientific investigation over the last several years (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib42">Lin et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib71">Riquelme et al., 2018</xref>). During dimorphic transitions in fungi, changes in cell shape is accompanied by changes in cell polarity, cell size, and cell-cell adhesion, and these changes are regulated by two major signaling pathways: the cAMP-PKA pathway and MAP kinase (MAPK) pathways. Both pathways are crucial for morphogenesis in fungal model systems, including <italic>Saccharomyces cerevisiae</italic> and <italic>Candida albicans</italic>. In <italic>S. cerevisiae</italic>, the cAMP-PKA pathway is a critical regulatory cascade that controls cellular differentiation, such as pseudohyphal growth, in response to glucose availability. The glucose signal is transduced through two parallel mechanisms: the G-protein-coupled receptor (GPCR) Gpr1-Gpa2 system and the intracellular Ras system. The activation of Ras is triggered by high glycolytic flux, which is directly controlled by the Hxt (Hexose Transporter) family dictating the precise rate of glucose import into the cell. Both the Gpr1-Gpa2 and Ras pathways activate the adenylate cyclase (Cyr1), leading to elevated intracellular cAMP levels. This cAMP binds to the regulatory subunit Bcy1, releasing and activating the catalytic Tpk subunits of Protein Kinase A (PKA). This PKA activation, driven primarily by Tpk2, promotes the shift to a filamentous morphology by inducing the expression of necessary genes required for pseudohyphal differentiation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Colombo et al., 1998</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib48">Lorenz et al., 2000</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib98">Xue et al., 1998</xref>)<italic>.</italic> Similarly, this pathway drives the essential yeast to hyphal transition in <italic>C. albicans</italic>, often via the regulator Efg1 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib49">Maidan et al., 2005</xref>). Concurrently, the MAPK (Mitogen-Activated Protein Kinase) pathway operates in parallel to the cAMP-PKA cascade and coordinates fungal morphogenesis in response to extracellular stress and nutrient signals. In <italic>S. cerevisiae</italic>, the Kss1 cascade is the key effector that drives pseudohyphal growth, predominantly activating under nitrogen-limiting conditions (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib47">Lorenz and Heitman, 1998</xref>). In the opportunistic fungal pathogen <italic>C. albicans</italic>, the homologous Cek1 pathway is indispensable for coordinating the complex hyphal development. Cek1 acts as a multifaceted sensor, by processing external morphogenetic cues and often engaging directly with the cell wall integrity system to ensure structural stability during the rapid yeast to hyphal transition. This pathway is a critical determinant of virulence, as its activation promotes the expression of adherence factors and ensures the formation of biofilms, enabling the fungus to colonize host tissues and resist immune response (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Csank et al., 1998</xref>). The cAMP-PKA and MAPK pathways function in a parallel manner, engaging in significant crosstalk to integrate diverse environmental signals and coordinate a precise morphological response (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Biswas et al., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">Kumar, 2021</xref>). While significant progress has been made in elucidating the intricate gene regulatory networks that govern these morphological transitions (e.g. Genetic networks that orchestrate yeast to pseudohyphal differentiation in <italic>S. cerevisiae</italic> and yeast to hyphal differentiation in <italic>C. albicans</italic> have been well characterized [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib59">Nantel et al., 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib74">Ryan et al., 2012</xref>]), a critical knowledge gap persists regarding the underlying metabolic determinants of fungal morphogenesis. Despite the recognized influence of nutrient availability on fungal morphogenesis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Broach, 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Fleck et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">Kumar, 2021</xref>), our understanding of the specific metabolic networks and their regulatory influence on morphogenetic switching in fungi remains incompletely characterized<italic>.</italic></p><p>In this study, we employed <italic>S. cerevisiae</italic> and the human fungal pathogen, <italic>C. albicans,</italic> to dissect the metabolic underpinnings of fungal morphogenesis under nitrogen-limiting conditions, a known trigger for morphogenetic switching in these fungi (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Csank et al., 1998</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Gimeno et al., 1992</xref>). Our findings reveal a critical role for central carbon metabolism, particularly glycolysis, in facilitating the yeast to pseudohyphal transition in <italic>S. cerevisiae</italic> in a cAMP-PKA-independent manner and the yeast to hyphal transition in <italic>C. albicans</italic>, both of which have been shown to be crucial for their nutrient foraging ability in diverse niches and the ability of <italic>C. albicans</italic> to successfully infect a host (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib63">Palková and Váchová, 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib90">Thompson et al., 2011</xref>). Comparative transcriptomic analysis identified a conserved metabolic network crucial for these morphogenetic switching events under nitrogen-limiting conditions. Importantly, we observed that perturbations in glycolytic flux using pharmacological and genetic means negatively impact the expression of genes involved in sulfur metabolism. Furthermore, our functional studies demonstrated that supplementation with sulfur-containing amino acids (cysteine or methionine) effectively rescued the morphogenetic defects resulting from glycolytic impairment, establishing a novel metabolic axis linking glycolysis and sulfur metabolism in the regulation of fungal morphogenesis. Finally, we investigated the implications of this glycolysis-dependent sulfur metabolism on the virulence of <italic>C. albicans</italic>. Our data demonstrate that a <italic>C. albicans</italic> mutant lacking genes that encode for a crucial glycolytic enzyme, phosphofructokinase-1 (Pfk1), exhibits reduced survival within macrophages and severely attenuated virulence in an in vivo murine model of systemic candidiasis, which is rescued in response to sulfur supplementation to the host.</p><p>Collectively, our research, for the first time, identifies a previously uncharacterized metabolic axis linking glycolysis and sulfur metabolism under conditions that induce fungal morphogenesis and underscores the importance of this metabolic network in regulating fungal morphogenesis across two key fungal species and the ability of the human fungal pathogen, <italic>C. albicans,</italic> to establish infection in a host. These findings address a fundamental knowledge gap in the field and contribute significantly to our understanding of a broadly conserved phenomenon that exists across a plethora of fungal species.</p></sec><sec id="s2" sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><sec id="s2-1"><title>Glycolysis is critical for pseudohyphal differentiation in a cAMP-PKA-independent manner in <italic>S. cerevisiae</italic></title><p>Nitrogen limitation is essential for yeast to pseudohyphal transition in <italic>S. cerevisiae</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Gimeno et al., 1992</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib64">Pan et al., 2000</xref>)<italic>.</italic> However, the influence of carbon sources on this phenomenon is not completely understood. It has been observed that fermentable carbon sources (sucrose, maltose, glucose, etc.) are important for inducing pseudohyphal differentiation under nitrogen-limiting conditions (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib92">Van de Velde and Thevelein, 2008</xref>). Conversely, when these were replaced with non-fermentable carbon sources, there was a significant reduction in pseudohyphal differentiation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib86">Strudwick et al., 2010</xref>). This indicates that the presence of fermentable carbon sources is critical for pseudohyphal differentiation in <italic>S. cerevisiae.</italic> Crabtree-positive organisms like <italic>S. cerevisiae</italic> metabolize glucose primarily via glycolysis to meet their growth and energy demands (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Barford and Hall, 1979</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">De Deken, 1966</xref>). In order to determine whether the ability of <italic>S. cerevisiae</italic> to metabolize glucose via glycolysis is critical for pseudohyphal differentiation under nitrogen-limiting conditions, we spotted <italic>S. cerevisiae</italic> wild-type ∑1278b on nitrogen-limiting media containing 2% (w/v) glucose (SLAD) with and without sub-inhibitory concentrations of 2-Deoxy-D-Glucose (2DG) and sodium citrate (NaCi), which are well-characterized glycolysis inhibitors (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Cramer and Woodward, 1952</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Evans and Ratledge, 1985</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib100">Yoshino and Murakami, 1982</xref>) and monitored pseudohyphal differentiation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1A</xref>). Our data demonstrate that sub-inhibitory concentrations of 2DG and NaCi significantly attenuated the ability of <italic>S. cerevisiae</italic> to undergo pseudohyphal differentiation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1B</xref>). We then isolated cells from these colonies and quantified the percentage of pseudohyphal cells (cells with a length/width ratio of 2 or more[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib77">Schröder et al., 2000</xref>]) in these colonies.

While nitrogen limitation is a well-established and essential trigger for the yeast to pseudohyphae transition in <italic>S. cerevisiae</italic>, the specific influence of carbon sources on this process has not been completely understood. Studies have shown that fermentable carbon sources are critical for inducing pseudohyphal differentiation under nitrogen-limiting conditions (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib92">Van de Velde and Thevelein, 2008</xref>). Conversely, when these fermentable sugars are replaced with non-fermentable carbon sources, a significant reduction in pseudohyphal differentiation is observed (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib86">Strudwick et al., 2010</xref>). These findings collectively suggest that the presence of fermentable carbon sources, and by extension their metabolism, is a critical requirement for inducing fungal morphogenesis in <italic>S. cerevisiae</italic>. Glucose in the extracellular environment can be sensed by <italic>S. cerevisiae</italic> using multiple proteins. One such protein is the well-characterized G-protein-coupled receptor (GPCR), Gpr1. Binding of glucose to Gpr1 activates a downstream signalling cascade, resulting in the production of cAMP which activates Protein Kinase A (PKA) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">Kraakman et al., 1999</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib101">Yun et al., 1997</xref>). This glucose-dependent cAMP-PKA pathway has been shown to be essential for pseudohyphal differentiation under nitrogen-limiting conditions (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib48">Lorenz et al., 2000</xref>). Additionally, a key glycolytic intermediate, fructose-1,6-bisphosphate (FBP), is also known to activate the cAMP-PKA pathway via activation of Ras proteins, further linking glucose metabolism to this crucial signalling cascade (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib66">Peeters et al., 2017</xref>). However, the role of glucose as a metabolite in the context of pseudohyphal differentiation is not known. Building upon previous data that fermentable carbon sources that are metabolized via glycolysis are able to induce fungal morphogenesis, we asked whether the ability of these cells to undergo active glycolysis is critical for fungal morphogenesis. We took a two-pronged approach which involved pharmacological or genetic perturbation of glycolysis to address this question. Our findings clearly demonstrated that active glycolysis is essential for fungal morphogenesis under nitrogen-limiting conditions. To understand whether the pseudohyphal differentiation defects we observed due to glycolysis perturbation were solely due to the inability of glucose to activate glucose-dependent cAMP-PKA pathway, we performed cAMP add-back assays and interestingly, exogenous supplementation of cAMP failed to rescue pseudohyphal differentiation defects caused by the perturbation of glycolysis (through inhibitors (2DG and NaCi) or through genetic knockout strains (<italic>∆∆pfk1</italic> and <italic>∆∆adh1</italic>)). Our results clearly demonstrate that the ability of <italic>S. cerevisiae</italic> to efficiently metabolize glucose via glycolysis is critical for pseudohyphal differentiation under nitrogen-limiting conditions, in a cAMP-PKA-independent manner. This implies that glycolysis may be parallelly regulating other cellular mechanisms essential for this morphological transition. It is plausible that the glycolytic flux, or a yet-to-be-identified downstream intermediate, acts as a distinct metabolic signal that is parallelly important for pseudohyphal differentiation along with the cAMP-PKA pathway. This uncovers a previously unrecognized layer of regulatory complexity in the interplay between central carbon metabolism and fungal morphogenesis.</p><p>To gain deeper insights underlying the glycolysis-mediated regulation of fungal morphogenesis in a cAMP-PKA-independent manner, we performed comparative transcriptomics on <italic>S. cerevisiae</italic> wild-type cells grown under nitrogen-limiting conditions with and without the glycolysis inhibitor, 2DG (which had the strongest inhibitory effect on pseudohyphal differentiation). As anticipated, genes involved in amino acid biosynthesis and transport were upregulated in the 2DG-treated cells, consistent with a feedback response that cells exhibit when glycolysis is perturbed under nitrogen-limiting conditions, as various intermediates of glycolysis are known to serve as precursors for the biosynthesis of several amino acids under these conditions (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Dikicioglu et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib51">Martíez-Force and Benítez, 1992</xref>). Remarkably, we observed a striking and unexpected downregulation of multiple genes specifically involved in the biosynthesis and transport of sulfur-containing amino acids, cysteine and methionine, in the 2DG-treated cells at both early and late time points of pseudohyphal development. This transcriptional downregulation was further validated at the protein level for key proteins involved in the sulfur assimilation pathway (Met4, Met32, Met16, Met10, Cys4, and Cys3), clearly demonstrating the dependence of sulfur metabolism on active glycolysis during fungal morphogenesis. This unexpected link between central carbon metabolism and sulfur metabolism is not restricted to conditions that induce fungal morphogenesis, i.e<italic>.,</italic> in surface-attached colonies grown in nitrogen-limiting conditions, since even in liquid cultures that have limiting levels of nitrogen, wherein <italic>S. cerevisiae</italic> cells do not undergo pseudohyphal differentiation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Gancedo, 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Gimeno et al., 1992</xref>), perturbation of glycolysis with 2DG results in significantly reduced expression of proteins involved in the sulfur assimilation pathway (Met32, Met16, Met10, and Cys3).</p><p>Given that multiple genes that encode for proteins involved in de novo biosynthesis of sulfur-containing amino acids were downregulated in the presence of 2DG, which strongly inhibits fungal morphogenesis, we wanted to explore the possibility that perturbation of sulfur metabolism is causal for the attenuation of fungal morphogenesis in the presence of 2DG. We tested the functional relevance of this glycolysis-dependent regulation of sulfur metabolism in fungal morphogenesis directly through exogenous supplementation of sulfur sources. Interestingly, cysteine specifically rescued the pseudohyphal differentiation defect exhibited by <italic>S. cerevisiae</italic> in the presence of 2DG. However, methionine was unable to rescue the pseudohyphal differentiation defect in the presence of 2DG even at various different concentrations (50 µM, 100 µM, 200 µM, and 500 µM). The observed differential rescue effects of cysteine and methionine could be due to the distinct amino acid transport systems used by <italic>S. cerevisiae</italic> to transport these amino acids. <italic>S. cerevisiae</italic> primarily uses multiple, low-affinity permeases (Gap1, Bap2, Bap3, Tat1, Tat2, Agp1, Gnp1, and Yct1) for cysteine transport, while relying on a limited set of high-affinity transporters (like Mup1) for methionine transport, with the added complexity that its methionine transporters can also transport cysteine (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Düring-Olsen et al., 1999</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">Huang et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">Kosugi et al., 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib55">Menant et al., 2006</xref>). Hence, it is likely that cysteine uptake could be happening at a higher efficiency in <italic>S. cerevisiae</italic> compared to methionine uptake. Therefore, to achieve a comparable functional rescue by exogenous supplementation of methionine, it is necessary to use a higher concentration of methionine. When we performed our rescue experiments using higher concentrations of methionine, we did not see any rescue of pseudohyphal differentiation in the presence of 2DG, and in fact, we noticed that, at higher concentrations of methionine, the wild-type strain failed to undergo pseudohyphal differentiation even in the absence of 2DG. This is likely due to the fact that increasing the methionine concentration raises the overall nitrogen content of the medium, thereby making the medium less nitrogen-starved. This presents a major experimental constraint, as pseudohyphal differentiation is strictly dependent on nitrogen limitation, and the elevated nitrogen resulting from the higher methionine concentration can inhibit pseudohyphal differentiation. Similarly, gene expression analysis using RT-qPCR revealed a significant downregulation of multiple genes involved in the biosynthesis of sulfur-containing amino acids (<italic>met32</italic>, <italic>met3, met5,</italic> and <italic>met17)</italic> in <italic>∆∆pfk1</italic> and <italic>∆∆adh1</italic> strains and the pseudohyphal differentiation defects observed in these strains were completely rescued by the addition of cysteine or methionine. These findings strongly implicate that de novo biosynthesis of sulfur-containing amino acids is a critical downstream effector of glycolytic activity in promoting pseudohyphal differentiation under nitrogen limitation. To directly assess the role of sulfur metabolism in fungal morphogenesis, we generated and characterized the <italic>met32</italic> deletion strain. This particular strain was critical for our investigation because, unlike other <italic>MET</italic> gene deletions, <italic>met32</italic> deletion does not result in auxotrophy for methionine or cysteine. This unique characteristic is attributed to the functional redundancy provided by its paralog, <italic>met31</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Blaiseau et al., 1997</xref>). The deletion of <italic>met32</italic> resulted in substantial defects in pseudohyphal differentiation under nitrogen-limiting conditions, directly implicating the role of sulfur metabolism in regulating fungal morphogenesis. Our sulfur add-back experiments demonstrated that cysteine or methionine rescued the morphogenetic defects exhibited by the <italic>met32</italic> knockout strain, further solidifying the direct involvement of sulfur metabolism in this morphogenetic switching process. How active sulfur metabolism contributes towards fungal morphogenesis is not yet understood, but given its critical requirement during this phenomenon, it would be an important question to explore and will further our overall understanding of this important biological phenomenon.</p><p>It is interesting to note that the expression of Met4, the principal transcriptional regulator of the de novo biosynthesis of sulfur-containing amino acids in <italic>S. cerevisiae,</italic> along with Met32, one of its cognate DNA-binding cofactors (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Blaiseau et al., 1997</xref>), are significantly downregulated when glycolysis is perturbed. Given the obligate requirement of Met4 interaction with DNA-binding proteins, such as Met28, Met32, or Met31, to elicit transcriptional activation of the genes involved in the de novo biosynthesis of sulfur-containing amino acids (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Blaiseau and Thomas, 1998</xref>), the observed downregulation in both Met4 and Met32 levels likely compromises the overall biosynthesis of sulfur-containing amino acids. This concurrent downregulation could explain the attenuated expression of downstream genes involved in the synthesis of methionine and cysteine. This suggests a novel regulatory mechanism wherein the expression of Met4/Met32 is coupled to glycolytic activity under nitrogen-limiting conditions. Given that sulfur metabolism is coupled to glycolysis in <italic>C. albicans</italic> as well and contributes towards fungal morphogenesis, it is likely that this conserved regulatory axis might be critical for fungal morphogenesis in a broad range of fungal species. Interestingly, Met4 regulation is directly dependent on Met30 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib73">Rouillon et al., 2000</xref>). Met30 functions as a molecular switch for Met4, the master regulator of the <italic>MET</italic> gene network. Under sulfur-replete conditions, Met30 ensures that Met4 remains inactive through ubiquitination and proteasomal degradation. Conversely, a reduction in sulfur availability diminishes Met30 activity, thereby de-repressing Met4 and allowing it to induce the expression of genes necessary for sulfur amino acid biosynthesis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib73">Rouillon et al., 2000</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib84">Smothers et al., 2000</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib89">Thomas and Surdin-Kerjan, 1997</xref>). Given this regulatory mechanism, we investigated the expression of proteins involved in the sulfur assimilation pathway (Met4, Met32, Met16, and Cys3), in a viable <italic>Δmet30</italic> deletion strain, under conditions where glycolysis was perturbed using 2DG. We observed no difference in protein levels of Met4, Met32, Met16, and Cys3, between 2DG-treated and untreated cells. This indicates that, in the heterozygous deletion strain of <italic>met30</italic> (<italic>∆met30</italic>), Met4 is not degraded even when glycolysis is perturbed, supporting the hypothesis that perturbing active glycolysis with inhibitors like 2DG increases Met30 activity, which in turn leads to the increased degradation of Met4, which would then negatively affect <italic>MET</italic> gene transcription, subsequently attenuating pseudohyphal differentiation. However, a surprising finding emerged when we examined Met30 levels in the presence of 2DG. There was no increase in the levels of Met30 in 2DG-treated cells compared to untreated cells. This suggests that glycolysis influences Met30 activity through a post-translational mechanism, rather than by altering its protein abundance. Studies have shown that under cadmium stress, Met4 activity is upregulated by reducing the activity of Met30 through post-translational events, specifically by inducing the dissociation of Met30 from the core SCF (Skp1/Cullin1/F-box) complex without affecting Met30 protein levels (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">Lauinger et al., 2024</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib99">Yen et al., 2005</xref>). This well-established paradigm provides a compelling framework for our observation, suggesting that active glycolytic flux, similar to cadmium stress, might rapidly modulate the activity of Met30 by decreasing its association with the SCF complex to control Met4 activity, rather than through changes in protein synthesis or degradation. Future studies will be needed to delineate the precise post-translational modifications or regulatory interactions that modulate Met30 activity in response to glycolytic flux.</p><p>Intriguingly, our work extended these findings to the pathogenic fungus <italic>C. albicans</italic>, revealing a conserved role for glycolysis-mediated sulfur metabolism in hyphal differentiation, a key virulence attribute in this species (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Gow et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib58">Moyes et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib94">Wilson et al., 2016</xref>). Similar to our observations in <italic>S. cerevisiae</italic>, <italic>C. albicans</italic> exhibited glycolysis-dependent hyphal formation under nitrogen limitation in a cAMP-PKA-independent manner. Perturbation of glycolysis (either by 2DG addition or the deletion of <italic>pfk1</italic>) resulted in the significant downregulation of genes involved in de novo biosynthesis of sulfur-containing amino acids (<italic>met32</italic>, <italic>met3, met5</italic> (<italic>ecm17</italic>), <italic>met10</italic> and <italic>met17</italic> (<italic>met15</italic>)) and the hyphal differentiation defects that occur in response to glycolysis perturbation could be rescued by the exogenous supplementation of cysteine or methionine, whereas the exogenous addition of cAMP failed to rescue the hyphal defects caused by the addition of 2DG or the deletion of <italic>pfk1</italic>. These results clearly demonstrate that de novo biosynthesis of sulfur-containing amino acids is a critical downstream effector of glycolytic activity in promoting hyphal differentiation under nitrogen-limiting conditions in <italic>C. albicans</italic> as well. Given that central carbon metabolic pathways like glycolysis and sulfur assimilation pathway are broadly conserved metabolic processes across a plethora of fungal species, it is possible that this novel regulatory axis might play a crucial role in modulating fungal morphogenesis in multiple fungal species, and further studies are warranted to explore this. Finally, given the established link between hyphal differentiation and <italic>C. albicans</italic> virulence, we explored the impact of glycolytic perturbation on the pathogenicity of this fungus. Interestingly, RT-qPCR analysis revealed a significant downregulation of genes involved in hyphal differentiation and virulence (<italic>als3, ece1, hwp1, hyr1, ihd1, rbt1,</italic> and <italic>sap6</italic>) upon 2DG treatment and in the <italic>∆∆pfk1</italic> strain. Interestingly, deletions of sugar kinases or transcription factors regulating the expression of glycolysis genes or <italic>adh1</italic> in <italic>C. albicans</italic> leads to filamentation defects and downregulation of filamentation/virulence-specific genes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Askew et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">Laurian et al., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib85">Song et al., 2019</xref>). Our data, showing transcriptional downregulation of hyphal differentiation and virulence genes following glycolytic perturbation via the deletion of <italic>pfk1</italic>, strongly corroborate these previous findings. This collectively positions glycolysis as a central metabolic nexus, rather than merely a catabolic process, profoundly influencing the pathogenic ability of <italic>C. albicans</italic> by intricately linking cellular metabolism, morphogenetic transitions, and the expression of its virulence factors. Furthermore, the <italic>∆∆pfk1</italic> strain displayed significantly reduced survival within murine macrophages and attenuated virulence in a murine model of systemic candidiasis, as evidenced by increased host survival, lower kidney fungal burden, and reduced tissue colonization. Remarkably, exogenous sulfur supplementation (N-acetyl cysteine (NAC)) to mice rescued the attenuated virulence exhibited by <italic>ΔΔpfk1</italic>. It is important to note that, in the context of certain bacterial pathogens, NAC has been reported to augment cellular respiration, subsequently increasing reactive oxygen species (ROS) generation, which contributes to pathogen clearance (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib81">Shee et al., 2022</xref>). Interestingly, in our study, NAC supplementation to the mice was given prior to the infection and maintained continuously throughout the duration of the experiment. This continuous supply of NAC likely contributes to the rescue of virulence defects exhibited by the <italic>∆∆pfk1</italic> strain. Essentially, NAC likely allows the mutant to fully activate its essential virulence strategies (including morphological switching) to cause a successful infection in the host. These findings underscore the critical role of glycolysis, and by extension, glycolysis-dependent sulfur metabolism, in the virulence of <italic>C. albicans</italic>.</p><p>In conclusion, our study unveils a conserved metabolic network that orchestrates fungal morphogenesis in response to nutrient availability. We demonstrate that active glycolysis, fueled by fermentable carbon sources in a cAMP-PKA-independent manner, plays a crucial role in regulating the de novo biosynthesis of sulfur-containing amino acids in Met30-dependent manner, which in turn are essential for the morphological transitions in both <italic>S. cerevisiae</italic> and <italic>C. albicans</italic> (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6</xref>). The attenuation of <italic>C. albicans</italic> virulence upon disruption of this pathway highlights the potential of targeting specific fungal metabolic networks as a novel antifungal strategy. Future research in our laboratory will focus on elucidating the precise molecular mechanisms by which glycolytic intermediates or downstream signals regulate the expression of sulfur metabolism pathway and how sulfur-containing amino acids contribute to the cellular processes underlying fungal morphogenesis.</p><fig id="fig6" position="float"><label>Figure 6.</label><caption><title>Glycolysis-dependent sulfur metabolism orchestrates morphological transitions and virulence in fungi.</title><p>Active glycolysis plays a key regulatory role in the de novo biosynthesis of sulfur-containing amino acids by modulating the activity of SCF<sup>Met30</sup> complex (SCF<sup>Met30</sup> complex includes Met30, Skp1, Cdc53, Hrt1, and Cdc34) which in turn affects the expression of genes involved in this process (In <italic>S. cerevisiae</italic>, <italic>MET</italic> transcription complex includes Met4, Met28, Cbf1, Met31, and Met32, whereas in <italic>C. albicans</italic>, the characterized components of this complex include Met4, Cbf1, and Met32.

More clarity is needed on how this mechanism is mechanistically distinct from the metabolic control - whether cAMP acts in parallel or downstream to sulfur-containing amino acids biosynthesis has to be characterized.

How does Cysteine/Methionine rescue morphogenesis? The author's response figure 1 shows that there are no significant transcriptional changes in the expression of cAMP-PKA pathway-associated genes, which alone could not completely explain the role of gpa2 in morphogenesis, because exogenous cAMP can restore pseudohyphal differentiation in the ΔΔgpa2 background (Revised Fig. 1L). This implies that gpa2's function in morphogenesis is an additional, or possibly a metabolic or post-transcriptional, layer of regulation, and its connection to sulfur-containing amino acids remains to be elucidated.</p></body></sub-article><sub-article article-type="author-comment" id="sa4"><front-stub><article-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.109075.3.sa4</article-id><title-group><article-title>Author response</article-title></title-group><contrib-group><contrib contrib-type="author"><name><surname>Shah</surname><given-names>Dhrumi</given-names></name><role specific-use="author">Author</role></contrib><contrib contrib-type="author"><name><surname>Rewatkar</surname><given-names>Nikita</given-names></name><role specific-use="author">Author</role></contrib><contrib contrib-type="author"><name><surname>M</surname><given-names>Adishree</given-names></name><role specific-use="author">Author</role></contrib><contrib contrib-type="author"><name><surname>Gupta</surname><given-names>Siddhi</given-names></name><role specific-use="author">Author</role></contrib><contrib contrib-type="author"><name><surname>Mathivathanan</surname><given-names>Sudharsan</given-names></name><role specific-use="author">Author</role></contrib><contrib contrib-type="author"><name><surname>Biswas</surname><given-names>Sayantani</given-names></name><role specific-use="author">Author</role></contrib><contrib contrib-type="author"><name><surname>Varahan</surname><given-names>Sriram</given-names></name><role specific-use="author">Author</role></contrib></contrib-group></front-stub><body><p>The following is the authors’ response to the original reviews.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p><bold>Public Reviews:</bold></p><p><bold>Reviewer #1 (Public review):</bold></p><p>Summary:</p><p>Fungal survival and pathogenicity rely on the ability to undergo reversible morphological transitions, which are often linked to nutrient availability.

Firstly, the striking transcriptomic changes observed upon 2DG treatment should be analyzed in <italic>S. cerevisiae</italic> adh1 and pfk1 deletion strains, for instance, through qPCR or western blot analyses of sulfur metabolism genes, to confirm that observed changes in 2DG conditions mirror those seen in genetic mutants. Secondly, differences between methionine and cysteine in their ability to rescue the mutant phenotype in both species are not mentioned, nor discussed in more detail. This is especially important as there seem to be differences between <italic>S. cerevisiae</italic> and <italic>C. albicans</italic>, which might point to subtle but specific metabolic adaptations.</p><p>The authors are also encouraged to refine several figure elements for clarity and comparability (e.g., harmonized axes in bar plots), condense the discussion to emphasize the conceptual advances over a summary of the results, and shorten figure legends.</p></disp-quote><p>We are grateful for this valuable and constructive feedback, and we agree with the reviewer on the necessity of performing RT-qPCR analysis of sulfur metabolism genes in ∆∆pfk1 and ∆∆adh1 strains of <italic>S. cerevisiae</italic> to validate our RNA-Seq results using 2DG. We have performed this experiment, and our results show that several genes involved in the de novo biosynthesis of sulfur-containing amino acids are downregulated in both the ∆∆pfk1 and ∆∆adh1 strains, corroborating the downregulation of sulfur metabolism genes in the 2DG treated samples. This new data is now included in the revised manuscript as Supplementary Figure 2C.</p><p>Furthermore, we acknowledge the reviewer’s point regarding the significance of comparing the differences in the ability of methionine and cysteine to rescue filamentation defects exhibited by the mutants, between <italic>S. cerevisiae</italic> and <italic>C. albicans</italic>. The observed differences between <italic>S. cerevisiae</italic> and C. albicans likely highlight species-specific metabolic adaptations within the sulfur assimilation pathway. While both yeasts employ the transsulfuration pathway to interconvert these sulfur-containing amino acids, the precise regulatory points including the specific enzymes, their compartmentalization, and transcriptional control are not identical. For instance, differences in the feedback inhibition mechanisms or the expression levels of key transsulfuration enzymes between <italic>S. cerevisiae</italic> and C. albicans could explain the variations in the phenotypic rescue experiments (Chebaro et al., 2017; Lombardi et al., 2024; Rouillon et al., 2000; Shrivastava et al., 2021; Thomas and Surdin-Kerjan, 1997). Furthermore, the species-specific differences in amino acid transport systems (permeases) adds another layer of complexity. <italic>S. cerevisiae</italic> primarily uses multiple, low-affinity permeases for cysteine transport (Gap1, Bap2, Bap3, Tat1, Tat2, Agp1, Gnp1, Yct1), while relying on a limited set of high-affinity transporters (like Mup1) for methionine transport, with the added complexity that its methionine transporters can also transport cysteine (Düring-Olsen et al., 1999; Huang et al., 2017; Kosugi et al., 2001; Menant et al., 2006). In contrast, <italic>C. albicans</italic> utilizes a high-affinity transporters for the uptake of both amino acids, employing Cyn1 specifically for cysteine and Mup1 for methionine, indicating a greater reliance on dedicated transport mechanisms for these sulfur-containing molecules in the pathogenic yeast (Schrevens et al., 2018; Yadav and Bachhawat, 2011). A combination of the aforesaid factors could be the potential reason for the differences in the ability of cysteine and methionine to rescue filamentation in <italic>S. cerevisiae</italic> and <italic>C. albicans</italic>.</p><p>Finally, we have enhanced the quantitative rigor and clarity of the data presentation in the revised manuscript by implementing Y-axis uniformity across all relevant bar graphs to facilitate a more robust and direct comparative analysis. We have also condensed the discussion to emphasize the conceptual advances and have shortened the figure legends as per the reviewer suggestions</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p><bold>Reviewer #2 (Public review):</bold></p><p>Summary:</p><p>This manuscript investigates the interplay between glycolysis and sulfur metabolism in regulating fungal morphogenesis and virulence.

The activity of the SCF<sup>Met30</sup> E3 ubiquitin ligase, mediated by the F box protein Met30, is dynamically regulated through both proteolytic degradation and its dissociation from the SCF complex, to coordinate sulfur metabolism and cell cycle progression (Smothers et al., 2000; Yen et al., 2005). Our transcriptomic (RNA-seq analysis) and protein expression analysis (Fig. 3J) confirms that Met30 expression is not differentially regulated in the presence of 2DG, effectively eliminating changes in synthesis or SCF<sup>Met30</sup> proteasomal degradation as the dominant regulatory mechanism. This observation is consistent with the established paradigm wherein stress signals, such as cadmium (Cd<sup>2+</sup>) exposure, rapidly inactivates the SCF<sup>Met30</sup> E3 ubiquitin ligase via the dissociation of Met30 from the Skp1 subunit of the SCF complex (Lauinger et al., 2024; Yen et al., 2005). We therefore propose that active glycolytic flux modulates SCF<sup>Met30</sup> activity post-translationally, specifically by triggering Met30 detachment from the SCF complex. This mechanism would stabilize the primary substrate, the transcription factor Met4, thus promoting the biosynthesis of sulfur-containing amino acids. Mechanistic validation of this hypothesis, particularly the assessment of Met30 dissociation from the SCF<sup>Met30</sup> complex via immunoprecipitation (IP), is technically challenging. Since these experiments will involve isolation of cells from colonies undergoing pseudohyphal differentiation, on solid media (given that pseudohyphal differentiation does not occur in liquid media that is limiting for nitrogen (Gancedo, 2001; Gimeno et al., 1992)), current cell yields (OD<sub>600</sub>≈1 from ≈80-100 colonies) are significantly below the amount of cells that is needed to obtain the required amount of total protein concentration, for standard pull down assays (OD<sub>600</sub>≈600-800 is required to achieve 1-2 mg/ml of total protein which is the standard requirement for pull down protocols in <italic>S. cerevisiae</italic> (Lauinger et al., 2024)).</p><p>Given that the primary objective of our study is to establish the novel regulatory link between glycolysis and sulfur metabolism in the context of fungal morphogenesis, we would like to explore these crucial mechanistic details, in depth, in a subsequent study.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p><bold>Reviewer #3 (Public review):</bold></p><p>This study investigates the connection between glycolysis and the biosynthesis of sulfur-containing amino acids in controlling fungal morphogenesis, using <italic>Saccharomyces cerevisiae</italic> and C. albicans as model organisms. The authors identify a conserved metabolic axis that integrates glycolysis with cysteine/methionine biosynthetic pathways to influence morphological transitions. This work broadens the current understanding of fungal morphogenesis, which has largely focused on gene regulatory networks and cAMP-dependent signaling pathways, by emphasizing the contribution of metabolic control mechanisms. However, despite the novel conceptual framework, the study provides limited mechanistic characterization of how the sulfur metabolism and glycolysis blockade directly drive morphological outcomes. In particular, the rationale for selecting specific gene deletions, such as Met32 (and not Met4), or the Met30 deletion used to probe this pathway, is not clearly explained, making it difficult to assess whether these targets comprehensively represent the metabolic nodes proposed to be critical.

For example, what are the expression and protein levels of Met30 in the initial analysis from Figure 2? How specific is this effect on Met30 in anaerobic versus aerobic glycolysis, especially when the pentose phosphate pathway is involved in the growth of the cells when glycolysis is perturbed ?</p></disp-quote><p>We are grateful for the insightful feedback provided by the reviewer. <italic>S. cerevisiae</italic> is a Crabtree positive organism that primarily uses anaerobic glycolysis to metabolize glucose, under glucose-replete conditions (Barford and Hall, 1979; De Deken, 1966) and our pseudohyphal differentiation assays are performed in glucose-rich conditions (Gimeno et al., 1992). Furthermore, perturbation of glycolysis is known to induce compensatory upregulation of the Pentose Phosphate Pathway (PPP) (Ralser et al., 2007) and we have also observed the upregulation of the gene that encodes for transketolase-1 (Tkl1), a key enzyme in the PPP, in our RNA-seq data. Importantly, our transcriptomic (RNA-seq analysis) and protein expression analysis (Fig. 3J) confirms that Met30 expression is not differentially regulated in the presence of 2DG, effectively eliminating changes in synthesis or SCF<sup>Met30</sup> proteasomal degradation as the dominant regulatory mechanism. This aligns with the established paradigm wherein stress signals, such as cadmium (Cd<sup>2+</sup>) exposure, rapidly inactivates SCF<sup>Met30</sup> E3 ubiquitin ligase via Met30 dissociation from the Skp1 subunit of the complex (Lauinger et al., 2024; Yen et al., 2005).

This mechanism would stabilize the primary substrate, the transcription factor Met4, thus promoting the biosynthesis of sulfur-containing amino acids.

Although the changes incorporated in the recent version of the article improved the illustration of the hypothesis in Figure 6, which connects glycolysis to Sulfur metabolism, the gene expression and protein levels of all genes involved in the illustrated hypothesis are not consistently shown. For example, in some cases, the Met4 expression is not shown (Figure 4), and the Met30 expression is not shown during profiling (gene expression or protein levels) throughout the manuscript. Lack of consistency in profiling the same set of key genes makes understanding more complicated.</p></disp-quote><p>We thank the reviewer for this feedback which helps us to clarify the scope of our transcriptomic analysis. Our decision to focus our RT-qPCR experiments on downstream targets, while excluding met4 and met30 from the RT-qPCR analysis, is based on their known regulatory mechanisms. Met4 activity is predominantly regulated by post-translational ubiquitination by the SCFMet30 complex followed by its degradation (Rouillon et al., 2000; Shrivastava et al., 2021; Smothers et al., 2000) while Met30 activity is primarily regulated by its auto-degradation or its dissociation from the SCFMet30 complex (Lauinger et al., 2024; Smothers et al., 2000; Yen et al., 2005). Consistent with this, our RNA-Seq results indicate that neither met4 nor met30 transcripts are differentially expressed, in response to 2DG addition. For all our RT-qPCR analysis in <italic>S. cerevisiae</italic> and <italic>C. albicans</italic>, we have consistently used the same set of sulfur metabolism genes and these include met32, met3, met5, met10 and met17. Our data on protein expression analysis of Met30 in <italic>S. cerevisiae</italic> (Fig. 3J) confirms that Met30 expression is not differentially regulated in the presence of 2DG, effectively eliminating changes in synthesis or SCFMet30 proteasomal degradation as the dominant regulatory mechanism.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>(4) The demonstrated link between glycolysis and sulfur amino acid biosynthesis, along with its implications for virulence in C. albicans, is important for understanding fungal adaptation, as mentioned in the article; however, the Met4 activation was not fully characterized, nor were the data presented when virulence was assessed in Figure 4. Why is Met4 not included in Figure 4D and I? Especially, according to Figure 6, Met4 activation is crucial and guides the differences between glycolysis-active and inactive conditions.</p></disp-quote><p>We thank the reviewer for their input. As the Met4 transcription factor in C. albicans is primarily regulated post-translationally through its degradation and inactivation by the SCFMet30 E3 ubiquitin ligase complex (Shrivastava et al., 2021), we opted to monitor the transcriptional status of downstream targets of Met4 (i.e., genes directly regulated by Met4), as these are the genes that exhibit the most direct and functionally relevant transcriptional changes in response to the altered Met4 levels.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>(5) Similarly, the rationale behind selecting Met32 for characterizing sulfur metabolism is unclear. Deletion of Met32 resulted in a significant reduction in pseudohyphal differentiation; why is this attributed only to Met32? What happens if Met4 is deleted? It is not justified why Met32, rather than Met4, was chosen. Figure 6 clearly hypothesizes that Met4 activation is the key to the mechanism.</p></disp-quote><p>We sincerely thank the reviewer for this insightful query regarding our selection of the met32 for our gene deletion experiments. The choice of ∆∆met32 strain was strategically motivated by its unique phenotypic properties within the de novo biosynthesis of sulfur-containing amino acids pathway. While deletions of most the genes that encode for proteins involved in the de novo biosynthesis of sulfurcontaining amino acids, result in auxotrophy for methionine or cysteine, ∆∆met32 strain does not exhibit this phenotype (Blaiseau et al., 1997). This key distinction is attributed to the functional redundancy provided by the paralogous gene, met31 (Blaiseau et al., 1997). Crucially, given that the deletion of the central transcriptional regulator, met4, results in cysteine/methionine auxotrophy, the use of the ∆∆met32 strain provides an essential, viable experimental model for investigating the role of sulfur metabolism during pseudohyphal differentiation in <italic>S. cerevisiae</italic>.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>(6) The comparative RT-qPCR in Figure 5 did not account for sulfur metabolism genes, whereas it was focused only on virulence and hyphal differentiation.

We wish to respectfully clarify that the data pertaining to expression of sulfur metabolism genes in the presence of 2DG or in the ∆∆pfk1 strain in C. albicans are already included and discussed within the manuscript. These results can be found in Figure 4, panels D and I, respectively.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>(7) To validate the proposed interlink between sulfur metabolism and virulence, it is recommended that the gene sets (illustrated in Figure 6) be consistently included across all comparative data included throughout the comparisons. Excluding sulfur metabolism genes in Figure 5 prevents the experiment from demonstrating the coordinated role of glycolysis perturbation → sulfur metabolism → virulence. The same is true for other comparisons, where the lack of data on Met30, Met4, etc., makes it hard.to connect the hypothesis. It is also recommended to check the gene expression of other genes related to the cAMP pathway and report them to confirm the cAMP-independent mechanism. For example, gap2 deletion was used to confirm the effects of cAMP supplementation, but the expression of this gene was not assessed in the RNA-seq analysis in Figure 2. It would be beneficial to show the expression of cAMP-related genes to completely confirm that they do not play a role in the claims in Figure 2.</p></disp-quote><p>We thank the reviewer for this valuable feedback.

Is there a difference in the uptake of cysteine vs. methionine in the two species or consumption rates?</p></disp-quote><p>We thank the reviewer for their detailed and constructive feedback. We believe this phenotypic difference can be due to the distinct metabolic prioritization of sulfur amino acids in C. albicans. Methionine is a known trigger for hyphal differentiation in C. albicans and serves as the immediate precursor for the universal methyl donor, S-adenosylmethionine (SAM) (Schrevens et al., 2018). (Kraidlova et al., 2016). The morphological transition to hyphae involves a complex regulatory cascade which requires high rates of methylation, and this requires a rapid and direct conversion of methionine into SAM (Kraidlova et al., 2016; Schrevens et al., 2018). Cysteine, however, must first be converted into methionine via the transsulfuration pathway to produce SAM, making it metabolically less efficient for these aforesaid processes.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p><bold>Reviewer #2 (Recommendations for the authors):</bold></p></disp-quote><p>The study's comprehensive experimental approach with integrating pharmacological inhibition, genetic manipulation, transcriptomics, and infection animal model, provides strong evidence for a conserved mechanism, though some aspects need further clarification.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Major Comments:</p><p>(1) While the data suggest that glycolysis affects Met30 activity post-translationally, the underlying mechanism remains speculative.

While we acknowledge that 2DG may induce secondary cellular stress, we are confident that the observed phenotypes are robustly attributed to glycolytic inhibition based on our complementary genetic evidence. Specifically, the deletion strains ∆∆pfk1 and ∆∆adh1, which genetically perturb distinct steps in glycolysis, recapitulate the phenotypic results observed with 2DG treatment. Given this strong congruence between chemical inhibition and specific genetic deletions of key glycolytic enzymes, we are confident that our observed phenotypes are predominantly driven by the perturbation of the glycolytic pathway by 2DG.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>(3) The differential rescue effects (cysteine-only in inhibitor assays vs. both cysteine and methionine in genetic mutants) require further explanation. The authors should discuss potential differences in metabolic interconversion or amino acid transport that may account for this observation.</p></disp-quote><p>We thank the reviewer for their valuable feedback. One explanation for the observed differential rescue effects of cysteine and methionine can be due to the distinct amino acid transport systems used by <italic>S. cerevisiae</italic> to transport these amino acids. <italic>S. cerevisiae</italic> primarily uses multiple, lowaffinity permeases (Gap1, Bap2, Bap3, Tat1, Tat2, Agp1, Gnp1, Yct1) for cysteine transport, while relying on a limited set of high-affinity transporters (like Mup1) for methionine transport, with the added complexity that its methionine transporters can also transport cysteine (Düring-Olsen et al., 1999; Huang et al., 2017; Kosugi et al., 2001; Menant et al., 2006). Hence, it is likely that cysteine uptake could be happening at a higher efficiency in <italic>S. cerevisiae</italic> compared to methionine uptake. Therefore, to achieve a comparable functional rescue by exogenous supplementation of methionine, it is necessary to use a higher concentration of methionine. When we performed our rescue experiments using higher concentrations of methionine, we did not see any rescue of pseudohyphal differentiation in the presence of 2DG and in fact we noticed that, at higher concentrations of methionine, the wild-type strain failed to undergo pseudohyphal differentiation even in the absence of 2DG. This is likely due to the fact that increasing the methionine concentration raises the overall nitrogen content of the medium, thereby making the medium less nitrogen-starved. This presents a major experimental constraint, as pseudohyphal differentiation is strictly dependent on nitrogen limitation, and the elevated nitrogen resulting from the higher methionine concentration can inhibit pseudohyphal differentiation.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>(4) NAC may influence host redox balance or immune responses. The discussion should consider whether the observed virulence rescue could partly result from host-directed effects.</p></disp-quote><p>We thank the reviewer for this valuable feedback. We acknowledge the role of NAC in host directed immune response. It is important to note that, in the context of certain bacterial pathogens, NAC has been reported to augment cellular respiration, subsequently increasing Reactive Oxygen Species (ROS) generation, which contributes to pathogen clearance (Shee et al., 2022). Interestingly, in our study, NAC supplementation to the mice was given prior to the infection and maintained continuously throughout the duration of the experiment. This continuous supply of NAC likely contributes to the rescue of virulence defects exhibited by the ∆∆pfk1 strain (Fig. 5I and J). Essentially, NAC likely allows the mutant to fully activate its essential virulence strategies (including morphological switching), to cause a successful infection in the host. As per the reviewer suggestion, this has been included in the discussion section of the manuscript.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p><bold>Reviewer #3 (Recommendations for the authors):</bold></p><p>Most of the comments related to improving the manuscript have been provided in the public review.
