We analyzed immunoglobulins (Ig) in explanted livers from SAH patients (n=45) undergoing liver transplantation and tissues from corresponding healthy donors (HD, n=10) and found massive deposition of IgG and IgA isotype antibodies associated with complement fragment C3d and C4d staining in ballooned hepatocytes in SAH livers. Ig extracted from SAH livers, but not patient serum exhibited hepatocyte killing efficacy. Employing human and <italic>Escherichia coli</italic> K12 proteome arrays, we profiled the antibodies extracted from explanted SAH, livers with other diseases, and HD livers. Compared with their counterparts extracted from livers with other diseases and HD, antibodies of IgG and IgA isotypes were highly accumulated in SAH and recognized a unique set of human proteins and <italic>E. coli</italic> antigens. Further, both Ig- and <italic>E. coli</italic>-captured Ig from SAH livers recognized common autoantigens enriched in several cellular components including cytosol and cytoplasm (IgG and IgA), nucleus, mitochondrion, and focal adhesion (IgG). Except IgM from primary biliary cholangitis livers, no common autoantigen was recognized by Ig- and <italic>E. coli</italic>-captured Ig from livers with other diseases.

It carries a particularly poor prognosis with a 28-day mortality ranging from 30% to 50% (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Dugum et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Thursz and Morgan, 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Sehrawat et al., 2020</xref>). Unfortunately, there is little to offer medically to such critically ill patients beyond supportive care with steroids, which improves survival in only a minority.</p><p>Studies have established connections between alcohol abuse, disruption of gut microbial homeostasis, and alcoholic liver disease (ALD). It has been speculated for over four decades that antibodies targeting intestinal microbes might play a role in pathogenesis of ALD (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Bjorneboe et al., 1972</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Simjee et al., 1975</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Kanagasundaram et al., 1977</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Kater et al., 1979</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Trevisan et al., 1983</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Koskinas et al., 1992</xref>). For example, the presence of IgA and IgG on the cell membrane of hepatocytes was detected by direct immunofluorescence in patients with ALD, and the percentage of IgG-positive hepatocytes correlated with transaminase levels, independently of the histological findings (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Trevisan et al., 1983</xref>).</p><p>Although a number of studies demonstrated liver IgA deposition in ALD in the 1980s, other reports concluded that IgA deposition in the liver was not specific for ALD but might reflect the reduced metabolism of the damaged livers (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">van de Wiel et al., 1987</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Amano et al., 1988</xref>) or the clearance of excess IgA from the circulation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Nagura et al., 1989</xref>). A recent study (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Moro-Sibilot et al., 2016</xref>) confirmed that human livers contained IgA-secreting cells originating from Peyer’s patches and directed against intestinal antigens. Interestingly, livers from mice with ethanol-induced injury contain increased numbers of IgA-secreting cells and have IgA deposits in sinusoids (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Moro-Sibilot et al., 2016</xref>).</p><p>The primary aim of this study was to determine if there was antibody deposition in SAH livers and whether antibodies extracted from SAH livers exhibited hepatocyte killing efficacy. The second aim was to determine if antibodies deposited in the liver were cross-reactive antibodies against both bacterial antigens and human proteins and whether the cross-reactive antibodies were presented uniquely in SAH livers.</p></sec><sec id="s2" sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><sec id="s2-1"><title>Immunoglobulins in ballooned hepatocytes in SAH patients</title><p>To determine whether antibodies deposit in SAH livers, we collected explanted liver tissues from SAH patients during liver transplantation at Johns Hopkins. Liver tissue sections with H&amp;E staining from SAH patients showed histologic features of SAH including macrovesicular steatosis, neutrophilic lobular inflammation, ballooning hepatocyte degeneration, Mallory-Denk bodies, and portal and pericellular fibrosis (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1A</xref>). Immunohistochemistry (IHC) staining by using anti-human immunoglobulin (Ig) antibodies demonstrated massive IgA and IgG deposition in ballooned hepatocytes in SAH livers, while none of the hepatocytes were stained with anti-human Ig antibodies in liver tissue sections from healthy donors (HD) except for positive staining in some hepatic sinusoid cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1B and C</xref>). To further confirm the deposition of Ig in SAH livers, the presence of Ig in liver tissue homogenates form SAH (n=7) or HD (n=7) was assessed by western blot analysis and ELISA assays. Western blot analysis demonstrated that the levels of IgA and IgG were dramatically increased in all SAH livers as compared with the donor livers (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1D and E</xref>). The IgM but not the IgE level was also significantly increased in SAH livers. The increase of IgA, IgG, and IgM levels in SAH liver tissue homogenates was further confirmed by ELISA. IgA and IgG isotypes were major Ig in SAH livers (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1F</xref>). Further analysis of IgG subclasses demonstrated that the IgG subclass levels – predominantly IgG1 – were significantly higher in SAH livers than that in HD (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1G</xref>). On the basis of these findings, we performed IHC staining for human IgG in SAH livers from 45 patients with liver transplantation and 10 donor livers in a clinical pathology lab at Johns Hopkins in a double-blind manner. The IgG+ hepatocytes in scanned slides of stained tissues sections were analyzed by using HALO Image Analysis Software. Positive cells were reported as percentage stained surface area of total annotated area by digital analysis (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1</xref>). Few IgG+ hepatocytes were identified in donor livers. In contrast, on average ~40% of the hepatocytes (ranging from 4% to 80%) were IgG positive in the SAH livers (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1H</xref>). These findings demonstrated the deposition of Ig antibodies in ballooned hepatocytes in SAH livers.</p><fig-group><fig id="fig1" position="float"><label>Figure 1.</label><caption><title>Immunoglobulin (Ig) deposition in ballooned hepatocytes of explanted livers from severe alcoholic hepatitis (SAH) patients.</title><p>(<bold>A</bold>) Liver tissue sections with H&amp;E staining showed histologic features of SAH.

Double staining for IgG and complement fragments C3d or C4d showed IgG co-stained with C3d or C4d in ballooning hepatocytes (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2C and D</xref>). These results indicated that IgG deposition in hepatocytes was associated with activation of complement. Furthermore, complement activation including the presence of C3d and C4d in SAH liver was confirmed by western blot analysis (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2E and F</xref>). Finally, we asked whether antibodies (Ig) extracted from SAH livers exhibit hepatocyte killing efficacy in an antibody-dependent cell-mediated cytotoxicity (ADCC) assay. Compared to isotype control human Ig from HD, no increased hepatocyte killing was observed when peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs) (effector cells) from HD were added into cultured human hepatocytes (target cells) in the presence of serum Ig from SAH patients. However, the hepatocyte killing efficacy was significantly increased when the same levels of Ig extracted from SAH livers were added into the hepatocytes/PBMCs co-culture system (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2G</xref>). These results demonstrated that Ig antibodies deposited in hepatocytes of SAH livers could induce activation of complement but more importantly, exhibited antibody-dependent cellular cytotoxicity of hepatocytes. Therefore, deposition of Ig antibodies may contribute to the hepatocyte ballooning degeneration and necrotic damage in SAH.</p><fig id="fig2" position="float"><label>Figure 2.</label><caption><title>Immunoglobulin (Ig) deposition is associated with activation of complement in ballooned hepatocytes and Ig extracted from severe alcoholic hepatitis (SAH) livers exhibits hepatocyte killing efficacy in vitro.</title><p>To determine if immunoglobulin in ballooning hepatocytes induces activation of complement, complement fragments C3d and C4d were analyzed in SAH livers.

Unique anti-<italic>E. coli</italic> IgG or IgA antibodies are identified in alcoholic livers, but not other liver diseases (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="fig4sdata2">Figure 4—source data 2</xref>), suggesting the impact of excessive alcohol drinking on translocation of anti-bacterial antibodies to the liver. Interestingly, few anti-bacterial antibodies in AC livers cross-reacted with human antigens (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s4">Figure 4—figure supplement 4</xref>), while a large number of anti-bacterial antibodies in SAH livers also recognized human antigens. The differing gut microbiota between actively drinking patients with cirrhosis and those with alcoholic hepatitis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Llopis et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Llorente et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Duan et al., 2019</xref>) supports the notion that alcohol-induced changes of gut microbiota composition may contribute to the development of anti-bacterial antibodies that cross-reacted with human antigens. SAH is an acute-on-chronic liver failure. Cross-reacting anti-bacterial autoantibodies translocated to the liver may determine the progress from chronic liver disease toward acute hepatitis.</p><p>Coincidentally, we found a significant number of unique IgA autoantibodies in HBV and unique IgG autoantibodies in HCV livers (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="fig4sdata1">Figure 4—source data 1</xref>), suggesting these IgA or IgG autoantibodies deposited in the liver might be derived from systemic autoimmune process which is ongoing in HBV- or HCV-infected patients (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Lin et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Gonzàlez-Quintela et al., 2003</xref>). Previous studies have clearly established the co-occurrence of certain autoantibodies in patients with chronic HBV or HCV infection and the autoantibody positivity was common in HBV and HCV patients. A strong association between increasing serum IgA level and disease progressing in patients with chronic HBV infection has been reported (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Lin et al., 2016</xref>). Similarly, serum IgG was increased in patients with chronic hepatitis C with respect to both alcoholics and healthy controls (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Gonzàlez-Quintela et al., 2003</xref>). No unique anti-<italic>E. coli</italic> protein IgA or IgG antibody was identified in HBV or HCV livers, indicating autoantibody production was related to the virus rather than bacterial infection.</p><p>The presence of cross-reacting IgM antibodies against <italic>E. coli</italic> and human antigens in the PBC livers is worth noting. Current data suggest that PBC is an autoimmune disease (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Bogdanos et al., 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Kikuchi et al., 2005</xref>) and an infectious etiology as trigger for development of PBC has been postulated. Antibodies reacting against the mitochondrial human pyruvate dehydrogenase complex which are the serologic hallmark of PBC cross-react with the <italic>E. coli</italic> pyruvate dehydrogenase complex, implicating <italic>E. coli</italic> infection in the pathogenesis of PBC (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">Wang et al., 2014</xref>). Interestingly, patients with PBC had a much higher number of inducible IgM-producing B cells in peripheral blood and each B cell produced a greater quantity of IgM protein compared with control (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Kikuchi et al., 2005</xref>). A large number of unique human and <italic>E. coli</italic> antigens were recognized specifically by IgM from the PBC livers, supporting the theory of bacterial infection-related IgM production in pathogenesis of PBC.</p><p>Our findings suggest that SAH may be an antibody-mediated disease due to intrahepatic etiology. Unlike antibody-mediated autoimmune disease where systemic B cells produce autoantibodies against self-antigens and unlike the fact that autoimmune diseases can be transferred from an affected patient to a normal individual by the transfer of patient-derived serum (or Ig), serum from SAH patients did not show hepatocyte killing efficacy in vitro. Importantly, no antibody-mediated rejection was observed in SAH patients following liver transplantation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">Weeks et al., 2018</xref>). It is perhaps more likely that gut-derived plasma cells were resident in SAH livers, and these plasma cells produce anti-bacteria antibodies which strongly cross-react with hepatocyte antigens. The diseased liver absorbs these gut-derived and locally produced antibodies without releasing them to the circulation. With the functional deposition of antibodies in the SAH liver (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2</xref>), activation of complement through the classical pathway which has been reported previously (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Shen et al., 2014</xref>) leads to ballooning degeneration of hepatocytes which is the predominant mode of injury in alcoholic hepatitis and untreatable inflammation. When antibody is deposited, it may also impair a number of important biological process in hepatocytes (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6</xref>). This pathophysiology implies severe damage from short-lived leaky gut due to a transient interval of high alcohol intake with ongoing residual continued damage due to the antibody production that continues only within the liver to be replaced. Therefore, it is reassuring that the new transplanted liver will not be damaged because the pathogenesis, involving the consequences of leaky gut pathology, will end quickly as long as the recipient remains abstinent, by which the new liver is not threatened by the SAH process.</p><p>The main limitations of the present study are the limited sample size, the lack of whole gut bacterial-proteome microarrays, and the lack of animal models of SAH. Nevertheless, identifying the presence of anti-bacterial autoantibodies in SAH livers provides a new insight into pathogenesis of SAH. Future studies utilizing needle biopsy samples from mild and moderate alcoholic hepatitis patients could assess infiltration of B and plasma cells and a likely correlation between antibody deposition and severity of hepatitis. For example, infiltration of plasma cells and antibody deposition may predict the progression toward SAH.</p><p>This may be a new therapeutic strategy in alcoholic hepatitis patients. First, preventing gut leakiness caused by alcohol drinking may prevent SAH. Second, eliminating antibody-producing B/plasma cells in the liver by using anti-CD20 may serve. Finally, a trial using complement inhibitors such as eculizumab may be worth considering.</p></sec><sec id="s4" sec-type="methods"><title>Methods</title><sec id="s4-1"><title>Collection of liver tissue samples</title><p>Explanted liver tissues and blood were collected from patients with SAH or AC who were referred for liver transplantation at Johns Hopkins Hospital after informed consent to study, share, and publish the research data derived from their specimens (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">Weeks et al., 2018</xref>).

Immune cell (NK) mediated ADCC is mainly triggered by IgG (binding to antigens of hepatocytes) through the interaction between IgG Fc fragment and Fc-receptors (FcγRs) of NK cells. If IgG deposition in the SAH liver were mainly due to non-specific Fc receptor-mediated binding to hepatocytes, we would expect IgG binding to FcγRs of hepatocytes and no activation of NK cells.
