combinations is limited, in part by insufficient understanding of how the transcriptional response of two monotherapies results in that of their combination. We analyzed matched time course RNAseq profiling of cells treated with single drugs and their combinations and found that the transcriptional signature of the synergistic combination was unique relative to that of either constituent monotherapy. The sequential activation of transcription factors in time in the gene regulatory network was implicated. The nature of this transcriptional cascade suggests that drug synergy may ensue when the transcriptional responses elicited by two unrelated individual drugs are correlated. We used these results as the basis of a simple prediction algorithm attaining an AUROC of 0.77 in the prediction of synergistic drug combinations in an independent dataset.</p></abstract><kwd-group kwd-group-type="author-keywords"><kwd>MCF7</kwd><kwd>LNCaP</kwd><kwd>cancer biology</kwd><kwd>drug synergy</kwd><kwd>transcriptomics</kwd><kwd>rna-seq</kwd></kwd-group><kwd-group kwd-group-type="research-organism"><title>Research organism</title><kwd>Human</kwd></kwd-group><funding-group><award-group id="fund1"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100004316</institution-id><institution>IBM</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>IBM Research</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Diaz</surname><given-names>Jennifer EL</given-names></name><name><surname>Ahsen</surname><given-names>Mehmet Eren</given-names></name><name><surname>Schaffter</surname><given-names>Thomas</given-names></name><name><surname>Stolovitzky</surname><given-names>Gustavo</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund2"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000002</institution-id><institution>National Institutes of Health</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>NIH T32 GM007280</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Diaz</surname><given-names>Jennifer EL</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund3"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000002</institution-id><institution>National Institutes of Health</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>NIH-U54OD020353</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Diaz</surname><given-names>Jennifer EL</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund4"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000054</institution-id><institution>National Cancer Institute</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>U54 CA209997 (Cancer Systems Biology Consortium)</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Califano</surname><given-names>Andrea</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund5"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000002</institution-id><institution>National Institutes of Health</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>S10OD012351 and S10OD021764 (NIH instrumentation grants)</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Califano</surname><given-names>Andrea</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund6"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100007277</institution-id><institution>Icahn School of Medicine at Mount Sinai</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Diaz</surname><given-names>Jennifer EL</given-names></name><name><surname>Ahsen</surname><given-names>Mehmet Eren</given-names></name><name><surname>Chen</surname><given-names>Xintong</given-names></name><name><surname>Losic</surname><given-names>Bojan</given-names></name><name><surname>Stolovitzky</surname><given-names>Gustavo</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><funding-statement>The funders had no role in study design, data collection and interpretation, or the decision to submit the work for publication.</funding-statement></funding-group><custom-meta-group><custom-meta specific-use="meta-only"><meta-name>Author impact statement</meta-name><meta-value>The transcriptomic profiles of the constituent monotherapies of synergistic drug pairs tend to be correlated and result in novel gene expression in the combinations.</meta-value></custom-meta></custom-meta-group></article-meta></front><body><sec id="s1" sec-type="intro"><title>Introduction</title><p>Combination therapy has become increasingly relevant in cancer treatment (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Al-Lazikani et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Ellegaard et al., 2016</xref>). The complexity of patient-to-patient heterogeneity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib70">Palmer and Sorger, 2017</xref>), intratumoral heterogeneity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Gerlinger et al., 2012</xref>), and intracellular pathway dysregulation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib40">Hyman et al., 2017</xref>) provides opportunities for combining drugs to induce responses that cannot be achieved with monotherapy. Effective combinations may target multiple pathways (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib47">Larkin et al., 2015</xref>) or the same pathway (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Baselga et al., 2012</xref>). They may also reduce the dose of individual drugs, thereby reducing toxicity, or target molecular mechanisms of resistance, thereby prolonging the effective duration of treatment (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Al-Lazikani et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">Greco et al., 1996</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib58">LoRusso et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib51">Lehár et al., 2009</xref>).</p><p>Drug combinations are said to be synergistic if their activity exceeds their expected additive or independent response (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib70">Palmer and Sorger, 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">Greco et al., 1995</xref>). Synergistic behavior is difficult to predict, so rational combinations may not validate experimentally (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib100">Wolff et al., 2013</xref>). Hypothesis-driven studies of the mechanisms of synergy and antagonism have focused on a limited set of candidate targets (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Bollenbach et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib41">Jiang et al., 2018</xref>). Alternatively, unbiased high-throughput screening assays (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib64">Mott et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib60">Mathews Griner et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Borisy et al., 2003</xref>) can identify synergistic compounds in a systematic way by assessing cell viability reduction by individual drugs and their combinations. Unfortunately, screening all possible drug-pairs in a panel of N drugs with N<sub>C</sub> cell lines at N<sub>D</sub> doses requires a large number (½ N (N-1) N<sub>D</sub><sup>2</sup> N<sub>C</sub>) of experiments, resulting in high costs that limit the practical reach of this approach. Computational methods to predict synergistic combination candidates are needed to improve the experimental cost-benefit ratio (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Fitzgerald et al., 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Bansal et al., 2014</xref>).</p><p>To address this need, the DREAM (Dialogue on Reverse Engineering Assessment and Methods) Challenges consortium (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib79">Saez-Rodriguez et al., 2016</xref>) conducted two community-wide competitions (the NCI-DREAM Drug Synergy Prediction Challenge, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Bansal et al., 2014</xref>; and the Astra Zenca-Sanger Drug Combination Prediction DREAM Challenge, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">AstraZeneca-Sanger Drug Combination DREAM Consortium et al., 2019</xref>) that fostered the development and benchmarking of algorithms for drug synergy prediction. In the the NCI-DREAM Drug Synergy Prediction Challenge, the organizers provided post-treatment transcriptomics data for each of 14 drugs administered to a lymphoma cell line, and asked participants to predict which of the 91 pairwise combinations would be synergistic (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Bansal et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib94">Sun et al., 2015</xref>). One of the key outcomes of the Challenge and other studies was that synergistic drug combinations could be partially predicted from the transcriptomics of the monotherapies (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib94">Sun et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib67">Niepel et al., 2017</xref>). The two best-performing teams based their algorithms on the assumption that a concordance of gene expression signatures in drugs with different mechanisms of action often yield synergistic interactions (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib103">Yang et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Goswami et al., 2015</xref>). This assumption, while plausible, has little experimental support beyond winning the Challenge. Further, the mechanism behind this phenomenon cannot be ascertained without transcriptomics data from the combination therapy, which was not provided in the Challenge due to cost. We therefore pose a fundamental question that can only be answered with matched monotherapy-combination transcriptomics data: <italic>How do two different transcriptomics profiles in cells treated with two different drugs combine to give a new transcriptomics profile when the drugs are applied together?</italic> If the combinatorial pattern of two gene expression profiles are different in synergistic versus additive drug combinations, then learning to recognize these patterns may enable us to predict synergistic combinations from the gene expression of monotherapies.</p><p>In this paper, we explore the relationship between the transcriptional landscape of drug combinations in relation to the profiles of the individual drugs. We performed a systematic, genome-wide analysis of matched time courses of gene expression following perturbation with individual compounds and with their combinations. Deliberately sacrificing breadth for depth, we studied the transcriptional temporal response of an empirically chosen synergistic drug combination, tamoxifen and mefloquine, in breast cancer and prostate cancer cells and compared it to that of additive combinations of withaferin with either tamoxifen or mefloquine. Rather than elucidating specific mechanisms of action for drugs and their combinations, we attempt to examine the transcriptome for molecular indicators of synergy. Our analysis shows that molecular synergy (measured by the number of genes whose expression changes significantly only in the combination), correlates with the Excess Over Bliss independence, a measure of the observed effect of a combination that is greater than the expected effect based on the Bliss model of additivity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">Greco et al., 1995</xref>) and increases with time. We used network-based analyses to trace the transcriptional cascade as it unfolds in time in the synergistic combination. We found that transcription factors simultaneously activated by both drugs dominate the cascade. We propose that a pair of drugs with correlated expression signatures is likely to trigger a synergistic effect, even when they target different pathways. We contrast this effect with the correlated, but additive, effect of increasing dose of one drug. Correlation of monotherapies predicted synergistic drug interaction with relatively high accuracy (AUROC = 0.77) using the independent DREAM dataset. This study represents a matched monotherapy-combination transcriptomic analysis of synergy, advancing both our understanding of synergy and ability to predict it.</p><p>The paper is organized as follows: First, we describe why we chose the monotherapies and combinations used in this paper and identify patterns of gene expression across synergistic and additive combinations. We analyze how those molecular patterns relate to phenotypic synergy and explore synergistic effects on biological processes over time with drug treatment. We then describe our exploration of synergistic effects on gene splicing as an alternative mediator of drug combination effect. Returning to gene expression, we study the mechanism of synergistic gene expression changes by identifying differentially active transcription factors through a transcriptional network and tracing the impact of these transcription factors in a temporal activation cascade. Then, we use an independent microarray dataset to verify the hypothesis that correlation between gene expression profiles of monotherapies can be used as an indicator of synergy. Finally, we discuss the structure of the synergistic transcriptional cascade and a plausible conceptual framework for the molecular underpinnings of synergy.</p></sec><sec id="s2" sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><sec id="s2-1"><title>Finding reproducible synergistic and additive combinations</title><p>To identify drug-pairs for the detailed time course RNA-seq analysis, we leveraged a pre-existing LINCS drug combination dataset collected at Columbia University (Califano’s lab) in the MCF7 cell line, a breast cancer line that is ERα positive (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib49">Lee et al., 2015</xref>), and the LNCaP cell line, a prostate cancer cell line that is ERβ positive (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib95">Takahashi et al., 2007</xref>). This dataset had information on all combinations of 99 drugs against 10 different drugs, each combination assessed in a matrix of 4 by 4 doses at 48 hr after drug application. Among these 990 drug combinations, we found 39 synergistic combinations with a maximum Excess Over Bliss (EOB) independence over the 4 × 4 matrix of more than 30%. From these 39, to select synergistic combinations in which both monotherapies played an important role in eliciting synergy, we chose 13 combinations whose constituent monotherapies showed a variety of combinatorial behaviors across the combinations (antagonism, additivity, and synergy in different combinations) for further testing. We re-assessed the synergy of these 13 pairs using a 6 × 6 dose response matrix and found that 9 of the 13 combinations remained synergistic, while four exhibited additive or antagonistic responses, which we removed from further study. Tamoxifen appeared in the greatest number (four) of these nine combinations. Given this data and the known clinical utility of Tamoxifen in ER+ breast cancer (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Davies et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Early Breast Cancer Trialists' Collaborative Group (EBCTCG), 2015</xref>), we focused on these four combinations. Of those 4, we sub-selected the two drug pairs with the highest EOB values, Tamoxifen (T) + Mefloquine (M) and T + Withaferin A (W) (EOB = 49 and 43, respectively). We then further measured viability (using the high-throughput Cell Titer Glo) and EOB in triplicate experiments using a 10 × 10 dose matrix at 12 hr, 24 hr and 48 hr (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="supp1">Supplementary files 1</xref>–<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="supp2">2</xref>) after drug treatment, obtaining results that were consistent with the previously found synergy. Note that these two combinations were tested in at least three independent sets of experiments at this point (99 × 10 screen, 13 combinations, and 2 combinations).</p><p>We noted differences in viability, consistent with recent concerns regarding the lack of reproducibility in cell line viability experiments in response to drugs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Haibe-Kains et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Ben-David et al., 2018</xref>), and yet TM remained consistently synergistic despite changes in the viability of its constituent monotherapies. In addition, we noted hormetic dose curves in response to the monotherapies, especially for W (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib62">Mattson and Calabrese, 2010</xref>). These hormetic responses are evidenced by a non-monotonic dose response, with more than 100% viability with respect to control for small doses (about 3 uM for W; <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="supp2">Supplementary file 2</xref>) or at short times after drug application (T and M at 3 hr, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1C–E</xref>). Many factors could contribute to hormesis. For example, it has been observed that efficient use of energetic processes in complex stress responses require biological resources to be deployed by the cell in a timely fashion (temporal hormesis) and at relatively low-doses (dose hormesis) to elicit a protective response (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib53">Li et al., 2019a</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib61">Mattson, 2008</xref>). The elucidation of these hormetic responses in the context of synergistic interactions could be a fruitful line of research, but goes beyond the scope of this paper.</p><fig-group><fig id="fig1" position="float"><label>Figure 1.</label><caption><title>The transcriptomics of drug combinations mirror their phenotypic characteristics.</title><p>(<bold>A</bold>) Monotherapies and drug combinations used in the study.

For completeness, we included the combination MW in subsequent studies.</p><p>We focused the rest of the study on these three drugs and their combinations (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1A</xref>), in an effort to understand how synergy operates at a transcriptomic level (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1B</xref>). We studied MCF7 and LNCaP cells under DMSO (vehicle control), T, M and W, and their combinations TM, TW and MW over a 48 hr time course (0, 3, 6, 9, 12, 24 and 48 hr) using nuclei counts as a direct readout of cell viability in relation to DMSO (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1C–H</xref>). At these doses, TM (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1C,F</xref>) synergistically reduced viability as early as 6 hr, with little effect from T and M individually in MCF7 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1C</xref>) and moderate effect in LNCaP (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1F</xref>). The synergistic effect of TW and MW was very small compared to TM in MCF7 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1D,E</xref>) and negligible in LNCaP (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1G,H</xref>). In relation to TM, we therefore consider the effects of TW and MW to be additive and dominated by W (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="supp2">Supplementary files 2</xref>, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="supp5">5</xref>).</p><p>Finally, we studied the effect of drug dose on viability, as a combination treatment exposes the cells to more drug than a monotherapy, and this could mimic the effect of increasing drug dose. Additionally, M has been shown to inhibit the function of MDR1, a multi-drug efflux pump (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib75">Riffkin et al., 1996</xref>) and its effect could therefore be simply to increase the intracellular tamoxifen concentration. We analyzed dose curves of T and M as monotherapies (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1B</xref>). We measured the effect of T alone at 5, 10, 20, 25, and 30 μM, and M alone at 2.5, 5, 10, and 15 μM at 24 hr in MCF7 cells. Viability in 25 and 30 μM T (37.1% and 13.7%) was similar to TM (23%), while viability of cells treated with M at 15 μM was 63.3%. We continued to observe some inter-experiment variability in the efficacy of monotherapies (e.g. T at 20 μM at 24 hr in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1C</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1B</xref>, the latter measured about 2 years after the former one). Interpreting 25 μM T as a ‘sham’ combination of 5 and 20 μM T (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1B</xref>), 30 μM T as a ‘sham’ combination of 10 and 20 μM T, and 15 μM M as a ‘sham’ combination of 5 and 10 μM M, we observed EOBs of 31.5, 53.1, and 17.5, respectively (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="supp6">Supplementary file 6</xref>), far lower than the EOB of about 103.9 in TM (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1C</xref>). Consistent with the synergistic Combination Index in TM (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1A</xref>), this suggests that the synergy we observed is a phenomenon distinct from dose response. To study the transcriptional mechanisms of drug combinations, we collected RNA from the same cultures from which we measured viability at each treatment for RNAseq (except 30 μM T, which caused too much cell death for RNA collection).</p></sec><sec id="s2-2"><title>Gene expression of drug combinations in relation to monotherapies</title><p>For each treatment (in doses and combinations listed above) and time point up to 24 hr, we collected samples in triplicate and performed RNAseq studies (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="supp7">Supplementary files 7</xref>–<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="supp8">8</xref>). The RNAseq data was reliable, with replicates showing a very high concordance and technical noise considerably smaller than the changes in expression observed under different conditions (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s2">Figure 1—figure supplement 2A–B</xref>). We first examined the gene expression over all treatments and time points in combination experiments (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1I</xref>) and variable doses used for the ‘sham’ combinations (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s2">Figure 1—figure supplement 2C</xref>) in MCF7, and combination experiments in LNCaP (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s2">Figure 1—figure supplement 2D</xref>). The transcriptional profiles for the monotherapies T and M were more similar to DMSO than TM. The transcriptional profiles for W, TW, and MW on the other hand, were similar to each other but different from T, M, TM, and DMSO over time. However, gene expression profiles from different doses of the same monotherapy were quite similar, with changes evolving gradually with increasing dose (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s2">Figure 1—figure supplement 2C</xref>). This pattern mirrors the phenotypic viability profiles (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1C–H</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1B</xref>). <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1J</xref> shows a two-dimensional principal component analysis (PCA) of the transcriptional data from the combination and dose experiments in MCF7. The data for T and M monotherapies, from both the combination experiments and the dose experiments, localize slightly but distinctly above DMSO. However, their TM combination is farther from DMSO than T or M but in the same vertical direction. The PCA representation of W progresses in an almost horizontal direction, with TW and MW co-localizing with W, which dominates the combination. Therefore, the two-dimensional PCA representation of the transcriptomes after treatment suggests orthogonal synergistic and additive directions. The PCA representation of the gene expression from treated LNCaP cells indicates very similar dynamics in this distinct cell line (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s2">Figure 1—figure supplement 2E</xref>).</p><p>We next examined differential expression relative to DMSO. The high concordance of replicates allowed for clear detection of differentially expressed genes (DEGs) in different conditions (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s1">Figure 2—figure supplement 1A</xref>). To determine DEGs in MCF7, we selected a false discovery rate (FDR) cutoff at which the only DEGs at time 0 (~30 min post-treatment; see Materials and methods) over all treatments are well-known immediate early genes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib81">Sas-Chen et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib98">Tullai et al., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="table" rid="table1">Table 1</xref>). We then used this cutoff across all time points and treatments of the fixed dose experiments. To achieve consistency in our treatment of the variable dose experiments which were done separately and with fewer replicates, we chose an FDR cutoff resulting in approximately the same number of DEGs in M 10 μM and T 20 μM (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s1">Figure 2—figure supplement 1B</xref>; see Materials and methods). In LNCaP, we selected anFDR cutoff at which there were no DEGs at time 0, as we noticed no differentially expressed immediate early genes in this case (see Materials and methods). We then quantified and examined the properties of DEGs in monotherapies and their combinations. The number of DEGs in MCF7 cells treated with TM, W, MW, and TW were 1 to 2 orders of magnitude greater than that of treatments with T and M (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2A–C</xref>). We evaluated the presence of <italic>synergistically expressed genes (SEGs)</italic>, which we define as <italic>genes that are differentially expressed in the combination therapy but not in either of the constituent monotherapies</italic>. Approximately 90% of DEGs in MCF7 cells treated with TM are synergistic, and not differentially expressed in either T or M alone (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2A</xref>) at any time point. To test for artifacts related to the chosen FDR cutoff, we calculated the percentage of SEGs over different FDR thresholds and observed that the general trend is independent of the specific cutoff (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s1">Figure 2—figure supplement 1C–D</xref>). In contrast, most DEGs in treatments TW and MW were also differentially expressed in W (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2B–C</xref>). These molecular signatures parallel the effect of these drugs on viability (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1C–E</xref>), reflecting the overall synergistic character of TM, and a mostly additive dominant effect of W. In LNCaP cells, we observed a similar effect of TM: more than 75% of DEGs are SEGs at any time point (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s2">Figure 2—figure supplement 2A</xref>). However, we observed that when LNCaP cells were treated with TW or MW, more than a quarter of DEGs were SEGs at any time point, and more than half at 12 and 24 hr (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s2">Figure 2—figure supplement 2B–C</xref>); in comparison, in MCF7 cells treated with MW or TW, less than a quarter of DEGs were SEGs at nearly every time point (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2B–C</xref>). This highlights the ability of different cells to respond differently to drugs, and we explore it further in the next section. Interestingly, across both cell lines and including the pairs in our dose experiments, the number of SEGs correlates well with EOB for all treatments and time points, (Pearson r = 0.63, p=0.000044; Spearman r<sub>s</sub> = 0.59, p=0.00013; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2D</xref>). The number of SEGs and the EOB of T 25 μM and M 15 μM are similar to TW and MW and considerably smaller than TM, consistent with the interpretations that behavior of TW and MW represent additivity, and that the molecular and phenotypic synergy of TM transcends the expected behavior of a simple increase in dose.</p><fig-group><fig id="fig2" position="float"><label>Figure 2.</label><caption><title>Synergistically expressed genes and correlated monotherapies are associated with synergy.</title><p>(<bold>A-C</bold>) Number of DEGs over time in MCF7.

Conversely, the monotherapy pairs from our dose experiments (i.e. T 5 and 20 μM, M 5 and 10 μM) had high correlation as expected, but low EOB. For this reason, when including the dose experiments, the direct correlation between EOB and the correlation of transcriptional profiles (see Materials and methods) is not significant (Pearson r = 0.31, p=0.068; Spearman r<sub>s</sub> = 0.28, p=0.097). When we removed these sham combination pairs from the dose experiments, we observed a significant relationship between EOB and correlation of transcriptional profiles (Pearson r = 0.59, p=0.00064; Spearman r<sub>s</sub> = 0.54, p=0.019). This result suggests that correlated transcriptional profiles of two distinct drugs may be important in defining synergy. Further study in other contexts would be necessary to generalize this hypothesis. The possible nature of correlation as a necessary but not sufficient condition for synergy will be discussed further in a later section.</p></sec><sec id="s2-3"><title>Critical cancer pathways are synergistically enriched</title><p>We checked for enrichment of gene sets associated with specific biological processes.

The W-enriched gene sets included two main classes: (1) cholesterol biosynthesis and metabolism was only synergistically upregulated in MW and (2) rRNA and ncRNA processing was synergistically upregulated only in TW at 24 hr, while tRNA and mitochondrial RNA processing was synergistically downregulated at some time points in both TW and MW. TM-enriched gene sets fell into three classes: (1) temporal differences: endoplasmic reticulum stress was upregulated at earlier time points in TM than in the monotherapies, whereas it was similarly enriched in W, TW, and MW at all time points except 24 hr, and intrinsic apoptosis in response to ER stress was upregulated initially in W, TW, and MW followed by normalization over time, whereas in TM it was synergistically upregulated in an increasing manner over time; (2) certain metabolic processes (generation of precursor metabolites and energy, cofactors, amino acids, and sulfur) were synergistically downregulated only in TM; and (3) genes that are repressed by estrogen receptor were synergistically upregulated only in TM. We hypothesize that the W-enriched classes represent mechanisms by which LNCaP cells counter the effects of the drug combinations and evade cell death, whereas TM-enriched gene sets, particularly class 2, may represent gene sets that function as harbingers of phenotypic synergy, distinguishing synergistic drug combinations from combinations whose effects can be resisted by cells.</p><p>Finally, we assessed for enrichment in phospholipidosis (PLD) in both cell lines. Research has shown that drugs that induce lysosomal stress and lipid accumulation (phospholipidosis), including T and M, tend to exhibit similar transcriptional profiles (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib92">Sirci et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib68">Nioi et al., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib66">Nadanaciva et al., 2011</xref>). We quantified enrichment in several types of gene sets with a focus on PLD (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib92">Sirci et al., 2017</xref>; see Materials and methods): cellular components, including in the top 20 gene ontology gene sets associated with PLD; a PLD gene signature (provided by authors of <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib92">Sirci et al., 2017</xref>); and a set of the gene targets of two transcription factors (TFE3 and TFEB) shown to be involved in lysosomal stress. We found that some PLD-associated cellular components are synergistically affected in TM, including the lysosome, Golgi, mitochondrion, nucleus, and nucleolus. PLD was highly enriched in all treatments in both cell lines (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s2">Figure 3—figure supplement 2</xref>), indicating generalized toxicity-associated effects of treatment. We studied the role that PLD might play in the high correlation between monotherapies in our experiments. We found that the relationship between correlation and EOB (excluding dose experiments) holds even when PLD genes were removed (r = 0.59, p=0.00068; Spearman r<sub>s</sub> = 0.55, p=0.0017). Furthermore, we found that genes in the PLD signature accounted for a small proportion of DEGs in all treatments (data not shown), and as a result the correlation between monotherapies is nearly identical whether we include or exclude the PLD signature genes. (A plot of the correlation between monotherapies including the PLD signature genes vs the correlation between monotherapies excluding the PLD signature genes yielded an almost perfect identity line with: r = 0.9999, p=1e-65; Spearman r<sub>s</sub> = 0.9995, p=2e-52.) Finally, enrichment of the PLD signature gene set in TM was only slightly greater than in TUM (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s2">Figure 3—figure supplement 2A</xref> for MCF7, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s2">Figure 3—figure supplement 2C</xref> for LNCaP), indicating at best mild synergy in PLD signature genes. These results show that PLD plays a role in the treatments considered here and that some transcriptional similarity between the monotherapies may be associated with PLD. However, PLD is one of many cellular processes triggered by the drug treatments, and it accounts only in a small part for the transcriptional correlation and synergistic gene expression we observed.</p></sec><sec id="s2-4"><title>Co-expressed genes show a synergistic temporal pattern</title><p>We studied temporal patterns of drug response in MCF7. We used k-means clustering (see Materials and methods) to identify co-expressed genes with similar time evolution in T, M, and TM (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="sdata7">Source data 7</xref>). This unsupervised clustering method identified four distinct temporal patterns (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4A</xref>): (1) upregulated in TM (2253 genes), (2) strongly upregulated in TM (421 genes), (3) downregulated in TM (1709 genes), (4) strongly downregulated in TM (718 genes). In each cluster, the average differential expression observed in the combination TM was significantly stronger than that in T + M, in which the (log) expression in T and M are added. The trajectory over time for most genes is monotonic and saturates at 9 hr. However, we also tested for genes whose trajectories were significantly different in TM than T and M (data not shown). A minority of genes in each cluster exhibited unique temporal profiles in TM, including mixed transient and monotonic behavior, suggesting the existence of temporal synergy (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4B</xref>).</p><fig id="fig4" position="float"><label>Figure 4.</label><caption><title>Differentially expressed genes have different time courses.</title><p>(<bold>A</bold>) Mean and standard deviation of gene expression in four clusters identified according to their similarity in expression in T, M, and TM in MCF7 cells.

Consistent with enrichment of these processes at each time point (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3</xref>), upregulated genes were enriched in endoplasmic reticulum stress (clusters 1–2), and downregulated genes were enriched in cell cycle and metabolic processes (clusters 3–4). In addition, apoptosis and downregulated targets of estrogen were enriched in genes strongly upregulated in TM (cluster 2), highlighting synergistic properties. Metabolic processes and the cell cycle were distinguished by clusters 3 and 4, highlighting the biological significance of the degree of downregulation. Finally, the genes with significantly different trajectories in TM account for a small but distinct subset of these synergistic biological processes (data not shown). Together, these data indicate that monotonic dysregulation dominates gene behavior and triggers important biological processes, which implies that the early transcriptional responses might be sufficient to predict synergy.</p></sec><sec id="s2-5"><title>Synergistically spliced and expressed genes are different</title><p>We studied splicing by examining the relative exon usage for each gene focusing on MCF7 cells.

Because activity of a TF may be affected in many ways, including post-translational modification, co-factor binding, and cellular localization, this approach is a more robust measure of activity beyond simply measuring expression of the TF itself. We utilized a conservative method for this analysis that distinguishes positive effector and negative effector (repressor) functions of a TF (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7s1">Figure 7—figure supplement 1</xref>; see Materials and methods). Of the 1101 TFs studied, most of the differentially active (DA) ones were uniquely active as a positive effector, suggesting that much of the response to these drugs is the result of upregulation of genes, and positive TF-gene interactions (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7s2">Figure 7—figure supplement 2A–B</xref>).</p><p>Similarly to the differential expression and differential splicing results, most differentially active transcription factors (DATFs) in TM were not DA in the monotherapies T and M (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7A</xref>).

First, <italic>distinct</italic> DATFs in each monotherapy may converge as regulators of other TFs when the two monotherapies are combined.

This dose enhancement mechanism in the combination will be called the ‘double-down’ model. We also assessed TFs that are linked through the MCF7 transcriptional network to those explained by these AND and double-down models in the same time point, as multiple rounds of transcriptional effects could occur within 3 hr (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig9s1">Figure 9—figure supplement 1</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib57">López-Maury et al., 2008</xref>).</p><p>We examined the potential effect of these two mechanisms on synergistic TFs and SEGs (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig9">Figure 9</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig9s1">Figure 9—figure supplement 1</xref>). At each time point, we identified the synergistic TFs that could have resulted from the AND mechanism (converging red and blue arrows in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig9">Figure 9</xref>), and the double-down mechanism (magenta arrows). At time 3 hr, for example, there are two TFs that are active in T, M, and TM: <italic>MYC</italic> and <italic>KLF10</italic>. These TFs are connected through the network to 9 TFs (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig9">Figure 9</xref>) active in TM (but not in T or M).

Correlation outperforms DIGRE in AUROC (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig10">Figure 10C</xref>) and AUPR (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig10">Figure 10D</xref>), with Bayes factors (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Berger and Pericchi, 2014</xref>) of 3.79 and 34.71, indicating statistical significance with Bayes factors &gt; 3 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib43">Kass and Raftery, 1995</xref>). It is interesting that simply computing the correlation coefficient between the transcriptomic response of cells to each of a pair of drugs produces a robust predictor of the synergy of the combination.</p></sec></sec><sec id="s3" sec-type="discussion"><title>Discussion</title><p>In this paper, we studied gene expression data taken from cells after treatment with monotherapies and their combinations in a detailed time course analysis, to elucidate the transcriptional mechanisms underlying synergistic drug interactions. We studied three drug combinations on MCF7 breast cancer cells and LNCaP prostate cancer cells: tamoxifen and mefloquine (TM), tamoxifen and withaferin (TW), and mefloquine and withaferin (MW). Of these three combinations, TM was dramatically synergistic (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1C,F</xref>). A mechanistic rationale for its efficacy is not obvious from the known target processes of T (estrogen signaling; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib87">Shiau et al., 1998</xref>) and M (autophagy; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib86">Sharma et al., 2012</xref>). However, the effect of M on estrogen receptor target gene sets (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3</xref> for MCF7, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s1">Figure 3—figure supplement 1B</xref> for LNCaP) indicates a moderate anti-estrogen effect, akin to the effect of recently developed novel quinolone derivative estrogen receptor antagonists (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib97">Tang et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib54">Li et al., 2019b</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib96">Tang et al., 2014</xref>). This suggests an unexpected overlap in the targets of T and M, even if estrogen receptor represents an ‘off-target’ of M, rather than a primary target, and may contribute in part to the high gene expression correlation we observed. Although these data, the <italic>in vitro</italic> synergy of TM, and mouse <italic>in vivo</italic> response to chloroquine and tamoxifen (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Cook et al., 2014</xref>) make this combination an attractive candidate for further study, we are not aware of clinical studies on it in cancer. The experiments required to validate the targets and synergistic mechanisms of TM and its <italic>in vivo</italic> effect would be beyond the scope of this study. Our aim was to shed light on the transcriptional response of the combination in terms of the monotherapies.</p><p>We have explored the regulation of synergy in MCF7 by integrating our gene expression data with an MCF7-specific transcriptional network, which allowed us to estimate the differential activation of TFs. Possibly due to overlapping target sets of T and M, we find that TF activity is remarkably correlated between T and M treatments at all time points, resulting in a considerably higher correlation in gene expression for this drug pair than the other two drug pairs we examined. This correlated TF activation in response to T and M results in a ‘double-down’ effect in the combination, where a TF activated by both drugs is reinforced in its activation in the combination at early time points, beginning with early response TFs MYC and KLF10 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib98">Tullai et al., 2007</xref>). <italic>MYC</italic> is a proto-oncogene present in a low-level amplification in MCF7 cells, likely functioning as an oncogene (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib78">Rummukainen et al., 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib88">Shimada et al., 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib84">Shadeo and Lam, 2006</xref>). It has been implicated in regulating the unfolded protein response after prolonged tamoxifen treatment (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib85">Shajahan-Haq et al., 2014</xref>), suggesting it may play a role in the ER stress we observed in response to tamoxifen treatment. Conversely, <italic>KLF10</italic> is a tumor suppressor that represses <italic>MYC</italic> expression in healthy cells and is involved in repressing proliferation and inducing apoptosis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Ellenrieder, 2008</xref>). It may therefore act to check unregulated <italic>MYC</italic> expression and facilitate the induction of apoptosis.</p><p>The action of these TFs triggers a transcriptional cascade that expands over time and results in the emergence of a massive number of SEGs (DEGs in the combination but not in either monotherapy) not recapitulated by increasing monotherapy dose. We found that a high number of SEGs is strongly associated with the synergistic combination in MCF7, whereas all combinations produced SEGs in LNCaP, only one of which resulted in phenotypic synergy (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2D</xref>). The data suggest that SEGs are a sensitive, but not specific, molecular indicator of synergistic processes in the combination, which in the case of TM includes pro-cell death processes. This phenomenon is distinct from the relationship between differential expression and cell death, which can reflect processes triggered by single agents, unrelated to the behavior of combinations.</p><p>The SEGs resulting from this cascade contribute to specific biological processes that are likely responsible for the killing effect of the combination TM, including activation of intrinsic apoptosis in response to endoplasmic reticulum stress and cell cycle arrest. While T promotes apoptosis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Chen et al., 1996</xref>), cells are rescued in part by the pro-survival activation of autophagy (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib80">Samaddar et al., 2008</xref>), which degrades and recycles metabolites and other cellular constituents including depolarizing mitochondria (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib44">Klionsky and Emr, 2000</xref>). Autophagy is enriched in T treated cells, likely in response to the unfolded protein response triggered by ER stress (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib44">Klionsky and Emr, 2000</xref>; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s1">Figure 3—figure supplement 1B</xref>), and perhaps accounting for the poor efficacy of T in the first 24 hr (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1C,F</xref>). Research indicates that treatment with M (an antimalarial agent) alters regulation of autophagy in a cell-type specific manner (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib86">Sharma et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib90">Shin et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib89">Shin et al., 2012</xref>). This effect may compromise mitochondrial recycling resulting in lower ATP levels (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib99">Wang et al., 2011</xref>).</p><p>When treating cells with T and M simultaneously, we expect that the pro-survival effects of the autophagy pathway will be abrogated by M, leading to a synergistic shutdown of metabolic processes, and cell death by apoptosis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Boya et al., 2005</xref>). Indeed, we observed synergistic changes in apoptosis and autophagy in both cell lines upon TM treatment (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s1">Figure 3—figure supplement 1B</xref>). The large numbers of SEGs we observed in all combinations in LNCaP cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2D</xref>) allowed us to study the distinction between SEGs in combinations with phenotypic synergy and those without. W, TW, and MW all quickly downregulated biogenesis of RNA and protein, TW upregulated RNA metabolism, and MW upregulated cholesterol metabolism, which may be physiologic responses to ER stress (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Faust and Kovacs, 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Christian and Su, 2014</xref>), whereas cells in TM regulated these processes more slowly. Perhaps through the combined protective effects of synergistically upregulating autophagy and downregulating biogenesis, cells treated with the W combinations were able to recover from an initial upregulation of intrinsic apoptosis in response to ER stress. In TM, however, the upregulation of autophagy and downregulation of biogenesis were not as robust, and cells gradually and synergistically downregulated metabolism and upregulated intrinsic apoptosis in response to ER stress (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s1">Figure 3—figure supplement 1A</xref>). These data indicate that drug combinations can induce SEGs that represent either protective responses or cell death, only the latter of which results in phenotypic synergy. This suggests SEGs are a necessary, but not sufficient, condition for synergy.</p><p>In MCF7, cell competition induced by varying levels of the synergistically active TF MYC may activate the synergistically upregulated <italic>IRAK2</italic> and its NFkB effectors (<italic>NFKB1</italic>, <italic>CASP8</italic>, and <italic>NFKBIA</italic> are upregulated in TM), triggering apoptosis in the less fit cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib63">Meyer et al., 2014</xref>). Cells that are dying or undergoing ER stress produce damage-associated molecular patterns (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib82">Schaefer, 2014</xref>), which activate <italic>TLR3</italic> signaling through a <italic>MYD88</italic>-independent (<italic>MYD88</italic> and its adaptor <italic>IRAK1</italic> are synergistically downregulated in TM) and <italic>TRIF</italic>-mediated pathway leading to the activation pro-inflammatory NFkB signaling (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib72">Pandey et al., 2015</xref>). All these biological processes (<italic>TLR3</italic> signaling, <italic>MYD88</italic>-independent and <italic>TRIF</italic>-dependent regulation of cytokines, NFkB signaling) are synergistically enriched in TM. The crosstalk between cellular stress response and innate immune signaling likely accounts for the enrichment of immunity functional classes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib65">Muralidharan and Mandrekar, 2013</xref>). The emergence of these synergistic functional gene classes was not recapitulated by increasing monotherapy dose (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3</xref>). Rather, they are unique to the combination. This suggests that a focus on known targets of monotherapies is insufficient to predict the effects of combinations.</p><p>The utilization of RNAseq technology allowed us to examine synergistic effects on RNA splicing, an approach not previously available to studies of synergy that used microarrays. Splicing may alter the proteomic function by adding or deleting a key regulatory protein domain (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Chen et al., 2017</xref>). We found considerable activation of alternatively spliced genes in MCF7 cells in the combination TM but not in either monotherapy. It is of interest that these alternatively spliced genes typically were not differentially expressed themselves. We found that like synergistic gene expression, synergistic splicing was dramatically higher in TM than TW and MW. This likely represents a distinct molecular mechanism of synergy (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6</xref>), consistent with previous work on transcription and alternative splicing (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib71">Pan et al., 2004</xref>). Exploring this preliminary evidence further, for example with long-read technology (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Chen et al., 2017</xref>), may reveal a stronger role for isoform switching in drug response than previously thought.</p><p>While some previous research has indicated that synergy is context-specific (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib51">Lehár et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">Holbeck et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">Held et al., 2013</xref>), the DREAM Challenge results suggested that similarity of monotherapies is associated with synergy. We observed this phenomenon in the present study in an independent context, measuring similarity by transcriptome correlation, and validated the finding in the DREAM dataset (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig10">Figure 10A</xref>). We also examined the role of the previously identified relationship between PLD and similarity of monotherapy transcriptomes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib92">Sirci et al., 2017</xref>), validating this relationship but finding that it does not appear to mediate the effect of correlation on synergy.</p><p>Our findings have led us to hypothesize about general features of synergy. Our analysis indicates that while all synergistic combinations have correlated monotherapies, the converse is not necessarily true: some drug pairs are correlated in gene expression, but do not generate a synergistic effect. Indeed, when we combine two doses of the same drug (sham combination), whose gene expression profiles are by nature correlated, this does not result in appreciably high EOB (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2E</xref>). This suggests that the mechanism whereby synergy ensues from transcriptionally correlated but not identical drugs has to include the AND type of activation even if the double-down mechanism is dominant, as was the case in the transcriptional cascade of TM (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig9">Figure 9</xref>). Correlated monotherapies and SEGs appear to be related phenomena that are required for synergy, but insufficient to generate it in all cases. We propose a conceptual framework for the relationship between monotherapy correlation, number of synergistically expressed and spliced genes and the activation of key pathways to account for these findings in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig10">Figure 10B</xref>. In this framework, correlated monotherapies can act through the ‘double-down’ mechanism generating a transcriptional cascade resulting in expression of many SEGs. We hypothesize that where SEGs are enriched in pro-cell death genes as in our MCF7 data (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3</xref>), this leads to phenotypic synergy. However, there may exist correlated drug pairs that generate only additive gene expression in biological processes such as PLD, or where SEGs appear but represent pro-survival programs or processes unrelated to cell viability, such as in LNCaP cells treated with TW or MW (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s2">Figure 3—figure supplement 2C</xref>). Under these conditions, correlated monotherapies would not result in a synergistic combination. Further studies on this theory in other contexts are necessary. However to our knowledge, only the data presented here, and the DREAM dataset we used, have matched post-treatment expression and viability data, limiting our ability to validate our findings regarding the gene expression patterns associated with synergy.</p><p>We have shown that gene expression correlation can be used to predict synergy with higher accuracy than the best performing algorithm in the DREAM Challenge (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig10">Figure 10C–D</xref>). As the DREAM dataset consists of microarrays in a lymphoma cell line, the importance of correlation appears to be independent of both cell type and gene expression measurement technology. Additionally, the monotonicity of our gene expression time course in the combination (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4A</xref>) indicates gene expression at later time points can be predicted from earlier ones, and synergy can therefore be predicted from a single time point. These rules of synergy could therefore be used as the basis for <italic>in silico</italic> screening of drug pairs for synergy using existing gene expression datasets. This approach may be an efficient and cost-effective precursor to preclinical studies of drug synergy.</p></sec><sec id="s4" sec-type="materials|methods"><title>Materials and methods</title><table-wrap id="keyresource" position="anchor"><label>Key resources table</label><table frame="hsides" rules="groups"><thead><tr><th>Reagent type <break/>(species) or resource</th><th>Designation</th><th>Source or reference</th><th>Identifiers</th><th>Additional <break/>information</th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td valign="top">Cell line (<italic>Homo sapiens</italic>)</td><td>MCF7</td><td>American Type Culture Collection</td><td>Cat No. HTB-22</td><td>RRID:<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://scicrunch.org/resolver/CVCL_0031">CVCL_0031</ext-link></td></tr><tr><td valign="top">Cell line (<italic>Homo sapiens</italic>)</td><td>LNCaP</td><td>American Type Culture Collection</td><td>Cat No. CRL-1740</td><td>RRID:<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://scicrunch.org/resolver/CVCL_1379">CVCL_1379</ext-link></td></tr><tr><td valign="top">Chemical compound, drug</td><td>Withaferin A</td><td>Enzo Life Sciences</td><td>Cat No. BML-CT104-0010</td><td/></tr><tr><td valign="top">Chemical compound, drug</td><td>Mefloquine hydrochloride</td><td>Sigma-Aldrich</td><td>Cat No. M2319-100MG</td><td/></tr><tr><td valign="top">Chemical compound, drug</td><td>Tamoxifen citrate</td><td>Tocris Bioscience</td><td>Cat No. 0999</td><td/></tr></tbody></table></table-wrap><sec id="s4-1"><title>Cell culture</title><p>MCF7 (ATCC HTB-22) cells were obtained from ATCC.

We then applied the Benjamini/Hochberg FDR adjustment to all the resulting p-values over all time points for the treatment.</p><p>We used an FDR cutoff of 0.05 to determine differential activity, and we determined the direction of differential activity of each regulon type (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7s1">Figure 7—figure supplement 1</xref>) as follows:</p><list list-type="order"><list-item><p>Positively regulated targets of TF enriched in upregulated genes → positive effector function activated</p></list-item><list-item><p>Positively regulated targets of TF enriched in downregulated genes → positive effector function inactivated</p></list-item><list-item><p>Negatively regulated targets of TF enriched in upregulated genes → negative effector function inactivated</p></list-item><list-item><p>Negatively regulated targets of TF enriched in downregulated genes → negative effector function activated</p></list-item></list><p>We then analyzed each set of two FDR values for the same transcription factor, treatment and time point. If positive and negative effector functions were both activated or both inactivated, the transcription factor was labeled concordant. If one effector function was activated and the other inactivated, the transcription factor was labeled discordant. If only one effector function was differentially active, the transcription factor was labeled unique. For 33 transcription factors in 142 cases across all treatments and time points, the same effector function was found to be both activated and inactivated by the above criteria. These nonsensical results were removed from further analysis, and may be due to transcription factors with an unusually large number of targets.</p><p>For each of 1101 transcription factors (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib101">Woo et al., 2015</xref>), we identified positively regulated targets and negatively regulated targets using an MCF7-specific transcriptional regulatory network generated by the ARACNe network inference algorithm (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib59">Margolin et al., 2006</xref>). These two sets represent the distinct targets of each TF’s positive effector function and negative effector function. We then assessed the enrichment of each set of targets in the lists of upregulated and downregulated genes in each treatment with respect to DMSO. These enrichment results were used to determine whether transcription factors were activated or inactivated with respect to DMSO (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7s1">Figure 7—figure supplement 1</xref>). Most transcription factors were uniquely differentially active in their positive effector or negative effector functions, but not both (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7s2">Figure 7—figure supplement 2A–B</xref>).</p><p>To account for some transcription factors having very similar sets of targets, we performed Fisher’s exact test as above for all possible pairs of transcription factor target sets among those that were significant at each treatment and time point. We then applied the Benjamini/Hochberg FDR adjustment to all the resulting p-values. For each case where the FDR was significant, we then performed Fisher’s exact test to assess enrichment of the relevant dysregulated genes in each of three sets: the intersection of the two transcription factor target sets, and each of the target sets individually with the intersection excluded. We then applied the Benjamini/Hochberg FDR adjustment to all the resulting p-values over all cases. Finally, where one effector target set was significantly enriched but the other was not, with their intersection excluded, the significant target set was retained as differentially active, using the original FDR values. All the rest were removed from further analysis.</p></sec><sec id="s4-13"><title>Graphical representation of the transcriptional cascade</title><p><xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig9">Figure 9</xref> shows the evolution of the active transcriptional network after introducing the two drugs T and M. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig9s1">Figure 9—figure supplement 1</xref> provides a more detailed representation of the mechanisms responsible for the activation of the synergistic TFs. In <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig9s1">Figure 9—figure supplement 1</xref>, each oval represents the set of TFs that are activated under T, M, and/or TM (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="sdata10">Source data 10</xref>): (101) indicates the set of TFs active in T and TM but not in M, (011) indicates the set of TFs active in M and TM but not in T, (111) indicates the set of TF active in T, M, and TM. Finally, (001) are TF active in TM but not in T or M. The number next to each oval indicates the number of TFs in that set. In this way we can keep track of the activation of synergistic TFs (001) in TM in terms of the activation of a pair of parent TFs, one in T (101) and one in M (011), or of one parent TF active also in T and M (111), and doing so at each time point. For example, for the time point at 3 hr (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig9s1">Figure 9—figure supplement 1</xref>), there 2 TFs active in T, M, and TM that belong to set (111), 2 TFs active only in M and TM that belong to set (011), and no TF active in T and TM but not in M (101). The middle layer of this representation contains three sets of synergistic TFs that are only active in TM, but not in T or M (001) (grey ovals). Each of these three sets include TFs whose regulators (i.e, their own TFs) are at least one TF in (111) (TF activated through the double-down mechanism: left grey oval in the middle layer), or has two or more parents with one in (101) and the other in (011) (TF activated through the AND mechanism: right grey oval in the middle layer), or has three or more parents from sets (101), (111) and (011) (TFs activated through both double down and AND mechanisms: middle grey oval in the middle layer). At 3 hr only the double-down mechanism can explain nine synergistic TFS, which in turn are parents and can explain the activation of 16 additional synergistic TFs, as indicated in the third layer of (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig9s1">Figure 9—figure supplement 1</xref>). To the right of the construct we just discussed, there are two more pairs of ovals. The first pair of contains an oval with dashed border, indicating the synergistic TFs that were active at the previous time point (t = 0 for 3 hr) and the arrow points to the grey oval that indicates how many synergistic TF ative at 3 hr can be ascribed to the activation of its regulators in the earlier time point. At 3 hr, both sets are empty. In the rightmost pair of ovals, the bottom one represents the set of TFs whose activation cannot be explained using any of the above mechanisms. Finally, the diagrams for 12 and 24 hr show additional sets of ovals representing TFs that belong to set (101), (011) and (111) at the previous time point, and that are needed to explain some of the synergistic TFs at the current time point, and whose numbers are indicated in italics in the middle layer of the diagram.</p></sec><sec id="s4-14"><title>Drug synergy prediction in the DREAM dataset</title><p>The DREAM expression matrix was downloaded from Synapse (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://www.synapse.org/#!Synapse:syn2785787">https://www.synapse.org/#!Synapse:syn2785787</ext-link>). To assess PLD in the DREAM data, we used the aforementioned limma (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib76">Ritchie et al., 2015</xref>) pipeline to calculate differential expression in each treatment compared to DMSO. Then we calculated enrichment of the 500 PLD genes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib92">Sirci et al., 2017</xref>; see above) in the genes with FDR &lt;0.05 in either monotherapy for each drug pair, using Fisher’s exact test as described above. For the correlation-based classifier, for each monotherapy pair, we calculated the Pearson correlation between expression of genes that are differentially expressed in either monotherapy (FDR &lt; 0.1) in the NCI-DREAM data. We ranked the resulting correlations in descending order to calculate a ranking of drug synergy. To test performance by the same measures as the NCI-DREAM challenge, we used the AUROC and AUPR for synergistic drug combination. For the AUC analysis, we used the same criteria as in the dream challenge for the definition of phenotypic synergy resulting in 16 synergistic drug pairs out of the total 91 pairs. To compare our method to DIGRE, we computed the Bayes factor (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Berger and Pericchi, 2014</xref>), a bootstrapped performance distribution between two classifiers. A Bayes factor of 2, for example, means that the first classifier outperformed the second at a 2-to-1 ratio. Two methods that have a Bayes factor &lt;3 may be considered statistically indistinguishable (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib43">Kass and Raftery, 1995</xref>).</p></sec></sec></body><back><ack id="ack"><title>Acknowledgements</title><p>We thank Mukesh Bansal, James Bieker, Ross Cagan, Jing He, and Carlos Villacorta for useful discussions.

support of the correlation between transcriptional profiles induced by drugs as predictor of drug synergies.

Based on these ideas an initial drug synergy prediction algorithm is proposed.</p><p><bold>Decision letter after peer review:</bold></p><p>Thank you for sending your article entitled &quot;The transcriptomic response of cells to a drug combination is more than the sum of the responses to the monotherapies&quot; for peer review at <italic>eLife</italic>.

The authors take on an important and unanswered scientific challenge in trying to predict and understand drug synergies from single drug transcriptomic observations. While I do have some comments to the manuscript I'm overall positive to the undertaking and the manuscript.</p><p>My only major concern is that data and source code is not available for peer review.

Efforts are made to predict drug synergy and efforts are made to show that their ideas generalize to other datasets; both of these efforts strengthen the paper.</p><p>I had trouble with the flow of the paper (the structure globally, not the writing locally), and how different components of the study were introduced. Overall I felt that the order of discussion points in the Introduction and early Results sections led to alternating ideas of what the paper contained. I had to read nearly half the paper before sorting it out. For example, you start by saying many general things that imply the study encompasses many drug combinations, then you discuss how you sacrifice breadth for depth and focus on M, T, and W, then you discuss correlations and results on larger datasets. All of this fits together, but a more compact summary/guide to the structure of the paper very early in Introduction could help guide the more casual reader (as even this detail oriented reader got a bit confused).</p><p>You introduce the study with much unneeded text about being first. Just focus on findings. Language about timeline linked to order does not last (as new studies emerge), change this language to date-linked and prior-study linked statements. This reviewer is not worried about novelty or being first for such an important topic that could well tolerate comparative studies and replication of results.</p><p>A lot rests on Figure 7A, but I do not find the relationship all that convincing.</p><p>Although Figure 2E has many data points it is based on your limited set of drugs and essentially one synergistic combination. This seems underpowered.</p><p>Is there a mix up in labeling Figure 1C, if not I am missing something, as the predictions don't seem to line up with what I expect given the text.</p><p><italic>Reviewer #3:</italic></p><p>The manuscript addresses an open and important problem in the field of pharmacology that is how to predict synergistic drug combinations and what are the mechanisms behind the synergy. The authors decided to focus on three drugs: Tamoxifen, Mefloquine and Withaferin and tested dose response of these drugs either alone or in pair-wise combinations and performed in depth transcriptomics studies at different time points. One of the main conclusions of the manuscript is that drugs with transcriptional responses that are correlated tend to be synergistic. Mechanistically the authors try to explain synergy as a caused by transcription factor cascades that are activated only in synergistic drug combinations.</p><p>My major concern is that two of the three drugs used, that is Tamoxifen and Mefloquine are well-known lysosomotropic drugs (see references below) that accumulate in lysosomes, especially at the very high concentrations as the ones used in this study, inducing large transcriptional changes. Also, it has been already reported that lysosomotropic drugs, including mefloquine, tend to have correlated expression profiles (Sirci et al., 2017). Also, somewhat troubling is that the only consistently synergistic combination was TM that is two lysosomotropic drugs at large dosages. The authors never mention property such as lysosomotropism and phospholipidosis but they really need to address this point and refer to the relevant literature (see below for some suggestions).</p><p>The authors try to address the problem that the synergistic effect they observed may be due to a dosage issue and not to the drug combination, so they treated the 25μM concentration of T in cells as synergistic of 5μM and 20μM and they indeed observed an EOB of 31.5 but not that high as the TM combination with EOB of 99.3. The TM combination, however, is 20μM T and 10μM M (if I understood correctly) so the total dosage is 30μM and it would have been nice to see the effect of T monotherapy to this concentration (and not to 25μM).</p><p>Unfortunately, despite the important problem and in depth analyses, the use of these two lysosomotropic drugs at this very large dosages makes the whole work less generic and a less appealing.</p><p>Also the overall conclusion that correlated transcriptional responses are a good predictor of synergy, is not that original as the authors themselves stated in the Introduction, similar conclusions were drawn in the DREAM challenge.</p><p>Useful references that should be cited in the manuscript:</p><p>Nioi et al., 2007; Ellegaard et al., 2016; Nadanaciva et al., 2011; Sirci et al., 2017; Petersen et al., 2013.</p></body></sub-article><sub-article article-type="reply" id="sa2"><front-stub><article-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.52707.sa2</article-id><title-group><article-title>Author response</article-title></title-group></front-stub><body><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>The general concept of in-depth analysis of drug combination effect on expression in a few cell lines for a few drug is interesting and offers an alternative to large shallow studies with multiple drugs in many cell lines.

Even if the concentrations appear to be high, drugs can vary from one batch to another, and cell lines can vary with passage and technique. Based on our results, at the doses we used, the <italic>effects</italic> of the drugs as monotherapies are highly unlikely to be supraphysiologic.</p><p>2) We analyzed phospholipidosis (PLD, an important response elicited by lysosomotropic drugs) in several ways on both our own data and the DREAM dataset. Interestingly, we observed weak but synergistic effects on lysosome biology at the molecular (transcriptomics) level. On the other hand, we found that PLD was highly enriched but weakly synergistic or​ additive (at the molecular level) ​in our data, and was associated with monotherapy correlation in the DREAM dataset but not associated with phenotypic synergy. We conclude that while PLD is associated with monotherapy similarity (confirming Sirci et al. results), it does not explain molecular or phenotypic synergy. Furthermore, even where synergistic effects on lysosome biology or PLD appear, research by Ellegaard et al., 2016,​ referred to us by reviewer #3 below) would suggest that this may actually be beneficial in cancer combination treatment.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>I have to add, that the journal's principles are against asking to include additional drugs, with more precise molecular mechanisms of action and well characterised off target profiles. in the study, since even if it will be an obvious solution will represent an amount of work beyond what is reasonable to ask in a revision.</p></disp-quote><p>Unfortunately adding more drugs and their time-resolved transcriptional profiles would not be feasible for this revision. However, we want to highlight that one of the important messages of the paper is the statement that “The transcriptomic response of cells to a drug combination is​ more than the sum of the responses to the monotherapies” as the title of the manuscript indicates. In that, we believe that the value of our paper adds considerably to the literature.</p><p>Having said that, if lysosomotropism were one of the important reasons for similar gene expression (as mentioned above, this is not what we found), then the conclusion would be that what we are observing is an additive effect. But this was addressed in our estimation of the Combination Index (CI), which quantifies synergy factoring out the dose effects. The CI of Mefloquine and Tamoxifen is 0.61 at 24 hours and 0.23 at 48 hours (as shown in Figure 1—figure supplement 1A).</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Therefore, before taking a decision I would like to read your rebuttal to the issues raised above: drugs used in toxic concentrations and mechanisms of action related with unspecific lysosomal toxicity.</p><p>At the same time it will be good to hear your response to the rest of the questions below, including software accessibility.</p></disp-quote><p>We apologize for the delay, motivated by the COVID-19 crises and related disruptions.

We started taking a data driven approach. As one of our cell lines was MCF7, an ER+ mammary cancer cell line, we decided to use Tamoxifen because it has been extensively studied as an inhibitor of the estrogen receptor pathway, and because it is clinically the standard of care for ER+ breast cancer. The other drugs were chosen based on the robustness of phenotypic synergy with Tamoxifen, as observed in several replicate experiments. (See subsection “Finding reproducible synergistic and additive combinations” in the Results section.).</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>– Code for reproducing analyses should be provided.</p></disp-quote><p>Code used in this paper is now available on GitHub.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>– How would the authors explain the contradictory observation that drug with somewhat similar gene expression profiles tend to act synergistically, while drugs with very similar gene expression profiles (e.g. two doses of the same drug) tend to not act synergistically, according to the bliss criterion?</p></disp-quote><p>This is an interesting point. “Self-synergy”, that is the positive excess over Bliss additivity (EOB) that results when two doses of the same drug are administered as in our “sham” combinations (in terminology suggested by reviewer #2), is a synergy that results by perturbing the cell twice in identical directions of transcriptomic response, what we had called in the paper, the double-down mechanism. When a cell culture is treated with two drugs, even when the gene expression is similar, the direction of transcriptomics response is not identical (see response to reviewer 3 for an example of differences in the master regulator MYC, for example), which can give rise to a richer repertoire of cellular response by the AND mechanism.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Reviewer #2:</p><p>[…]</p><p>I had trouble with the flow of the paper (the structure globally, not the writing locally), and how different components of the study were introduced.

However, in our study both Tamoxifen (T) and Mefloquine (M) were used at empirically chosen concentrations that didn't affect survival when used as monotherapies. Indeed, Figure 1C shows that the viability of MCF7 cells when treated with T and M independently is close to 100% at all time points up to 48 hours. Figure 1F shows the same is true for LNCaP cells up to 24 hours. Furthermore, there were less than 100 genes differentially expressed by either T or M at 24 hours in MCF7 (Figure 2A) indicating that the transcriptional response to the monotherapies at the doses considered here was at best mild. Another way to see this is in Figure 1I, which shows the heat map of the transcriptional response to DMSO, T and M. It can be seen that at the doses used, the transcriptional profile of T and M is more similar to DMSO than to TM.</p><p>The apparent discordance of the fact that other labs may have found that 20 μM of T or 10 μM of M elicits a strong effect can be accounted for, at least in part, by the fact that different viability assays can be difficult to compare even if using the “same” drugs and the same “cell types” as used in other laboratories. The paper “Genetic and transcriptional evolution alters cancer cell​ line drug response”​ by Ben-David, et al.​​ in Todd Golub’s lab (cited in the subsection “Finding reproducible synergistic and additive combinations”) showed a wide variety of genetic profiles and gene expression among 27 different versions of MCF7 cells. In addition, their drug experiments seem to indicate that just 7 passages are enough to cause noticeable differences in drug response, including abrogating some drug responses and inducing responses where there were none. The authors argue that this “cannot be explained by irreproducibility of the assay.”</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Also it has been already reported that lysosomotropic drugs, including mefloquine, tend to have correlated expression profiles (Sirci et al., 2017).</p></disp-quote><p>We thank the reviewer for bringing the interesting Sirci et al.​​’s paper by Diego di Bernardo’s lab to our attention. There are a number of discoveries in Sirci et al​. ​. that are relevant to our paper. The authors discover that amongst the most “transcriptionally close” and “structurally distant” drug pairs there was an enrichment of lysosomotropic drugs and drugs inducing PLD. They then studied 36 cationic amphiphilic drugs (CAD) drugs that are known to induce PLD, and did a Drug Set Enrichment Analysis (DSEA) analysis, to find that in aggregate these 36 drugs have</p><p>“lysosome” as the top enriched GO cellular component. They then compiled the PLD consensus transcriptional signature and found that 50% of the compounds induced PLD at high concentrations. All this suggests that lysosomotropic drugs induce a transcriptional response associated with PLD.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Also somewhat troubling is that the only consistently synergistic combination was TM that is two lysosomotropic drugs at large dosages. The authors never mention property such as lysosomotropism and phospholipidosis but they really need to address this point and refer to the relevant literature (see below for some suggestions).</p></disp-quote><p>We appreciate the reviewer pointing us to literature on PLD. This represents an interesting mechanistic insight into drug toxicity. We reviewed Sirci et al.’s paper in detail. Sirci et al. showed that two lysosomotropic drugs that induce PLD elicit a cellular response characterized by a shared transcriptomics signature of about 500 genes. Because of its relevance to our study, we studied the PLD signature effect as well as other possible transcriptional processes enriched in our experiments, and studied the degree to which the PLD signature contributes to the similarity between the transcriptional responses of the cell to the two drugs.</p><p>In this revision, we introduced a new set of analyses on phospholipidosis enrichment in our data. We assessed several gene sets based on Sirci, et al.’s data, including the PLD gene signature they derived, kindly provided by Diego di Bernardo upon our request, the top 20 Gene Ontology gene sets they found associated with PLD (which all happen to be cellular components, likely because they did not assess biological processes separately), and the transcriptional targets of two master regulators of PLD they identify, based on our MCF7 network. Our results are described throughout the paper (subsection “Critical cancer pathways are synergistically enriched” and Discussion), and the important new paragraphs are colored in blue in the revision. We further assessed enrichment in the PLD signature in all the drug pairs in the datasets used in the DREAM Challenge and compared it to correlation and synergy (491-507). Taken together, we find:</p><p>1) Validation of Sirci, et al.’s findings in independent contexts, in that PLD is highly enriched in tamoxifen and mefloquine treated cells in our data, and monotherapy correlation is associated with PLD enrichment in the DREAM data.</p><p>2) PLD appears to be an insufficient mechanism to explain correlated monotherapies. In both our data and the DREAM data, monotherapy correlation was still associated with EOB when we removed the 500 PLD genes from the calculation. In addition, while the</p><p>TFEB/TFE3 target set was weakly but synergistically enriched in TM (Figure 3—figure supplement 2B), only TFE3 is activated in the cascade of TFs we analyzed that trigger SEG expression in MCF7, and it only appears at 24 hours (Figure 3—figure supplement 2). Finally, a number of diverse biological processes are synergistically enriched in TM (Figure 2F) that are unlikely to all be explained mechanistically by PLD.</p><p>3) We previously noted that correlated monotherapies must in some cases result in additive gene expression, or synergistic gene expression that does not lead to phenotypic synergy (Figure 7B). In the DREAM data, we found that enrichment in PLD is not associated with EOB. We therefore propose that some of the correlated but additive drug pairs may exhibit PLD. In other words, the data suggest that correlated monotherapies are associated with both PLD and synergy, but apparently by different mechanisms, as PLD and synergy are not associated with each other.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>The authors try to address the problem that the synergistic effect they observed may be due to a dosage issue and not to the drug combination, so they treated the 25μM concentration of T in cells as synergistic of 5μM and 20μM and they indeed observed an EOB of 31.5 but not that high as the TM combination with EOB of 99.3. The TM combination, however, is 20 μM T and 10μM M (if I understood correctly) so the total dosage is 30μM and it would have been nice to see the effect of T monotherapy to this concentration (and not to 25μM).</p></disp-quote><p>The viability at 30μM was measured to be 13.7% but not reported in the previous version of the manuscript because at those low viabilities we couldn’t extract sufficient amounts of good quality RNA from the cell culture for the RNAseq experiments. However, as requested by the reviewer, we are happy to report it in this revision. As shown in Figure 1—figure supplement 1B, the viability after treatment with T at 30 μM was 13.7%. The Excess over Bliss corresponding to the sham combinations at 30 μM (assuming a combination of 10μM + 20μM) was 53.1%, considerably smaller than the EOB of ~100% for TM at comparable doses, and comparable final Viability (subsection “Finding reproducible synergistic and additive combinations”). For the discussion of the transcriptomics of sham combinations we used the RNA extracted from the cell culture treated with T at 25 μM.</p><p>Another indication that the reduction of viability in TM is due to synergy and not to dose effect is the Combination Index (CI), which quantifies synergy factoring out the dose effects. CI for Mefloquine and Tamoxifen is 0.61 at 24 hours and 0.23 at 48 hours (as shown in Figure 1—figure supplement 1A). A CI &lt; 1 indicates synergy.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Unfortunately, despite the important problem and in depth analyses, the use of these two lysosomotropic drugs at this very large dosages makes the whole work less generic and a less appealing.</p></disp-quote><p>We believe that the above discussion justifies that the dosages are not large enough to obfuscate the MOA of the individual drugs. Our new analyses show that the PLD response is not the only process at play in the response of the cells. We substantially rewrote some parts of the paper to reflect the presence of a PLD enrichment in the transcriptional response to drugs like those we studied, as suggested in Sirci et al.​ ​ (subsection “Critical cancer pathways are synergistically enriched”).</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Also the overall conclusion that correlated transcriptional responses are a good predictor of synergy, is not that original as the authors themselves stated in the Introduction, similar conclusions were drawn in the DREAM challenge.</p></disp-quote><p>The reviewer is correct. In the DREAM Challenge there were many hypotheses as to what is the transcriptomic response of a combination given the individual responses. Some of the best performing algorithms hypothesized that similar monotherapy transcriptomes would result in synergy. In this paper we can answer this question at least for a small subset of drugs. We directly demonstrate that correlated monotherapy transcriptomes are associated with synergy, and suggest that the “double down” mechanism seems to drive this effect. We use DREAM as a secondary validation of the simplest version of this association. We have clarified these relationships between our work and the DREAM challenge (Discussion).</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Useful references that should be cited in the manuscript:</p><p>Nioi et al., 2007; Ellegaard et al., 2016; Nadanaciva et al., 2011; Sirci et al., 2017; Petersen et al., 2013.</p></disp-quote><p>We thank the reviewer for pointing out this literature and have added the citations.</p></body></sub-article></article>
