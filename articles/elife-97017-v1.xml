Nipah virus (NiV) attachment protein (G) binds to ephrinB2 or -B3 receptors, and fusion protein (F) mediates membrane fusion. NiV-F is a class I fusion protein and is activated by endosomal cleavage. The crystal structure of a soluble GCN4-decorated NiV-F shows a hexamer-of-trimer assembly. Here, we used single-molecule localization microscopy to quantify the NiV-F distribution and organization on cell and virus-like particle membranes at a nanometer precision. We found that NiV-F on biological membranes forms distinctive clusters that are independent of endosomal cleavage or expression levels. The sequestration of NiV-F into dense clusters favors membrane fusion triggering. The nano-distribution and organization of NiV-F are susceptible to mutations at the hexamer-of-trimer interface, and the putative oligomerization motif on the transmembrane domain. We also show that NiV-F nanoclusters are maintained by NiV-F–AP-2 interactions and the clathrin coat assembly. We propose that the organization of NiV-F into nanoclusters facilitates membrane fusion triggering by a mixed population of NiV-F molecules with varied degrees of cleavage and opportunities for interacting with the NiV-G/receptor complex. These observations provide insights into the in situ organization and activation mechanisms of the NiV fusion machinery.</p></abstract><kwd-group kwd-group-type="author-keywords"><kwd>membrane fusion</kwd><kwd>single-molecule localization microscopy</kwd><kwd>paramyxovirus</kwd></kwd-group><kwd-group kwd-group-type="research-organism"><title>Research organism</title><kwd>Viruses</kwd></kwd-group><funding-group><award-group id="fund1"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100000024</institution-id><institution>Canadian Institutes of Health Research</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>183861</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Liu</surname><given-names>Qian</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund2"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100000024</institution-id><institution>Canadian Institutes of Health Research</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>175622</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Liu</surname><given-names>Qian</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><funding-statement>The funders had no role in study design, data collection and interpretation, or the decision to submit the work for publication.</funding-statement></funding-group><custom-meta-group><custom-meta specific-use="meta-only"><meta-name>Author impact statement</meta-name><meta-value>Single-molecule localization imaging shows that the Nipah virus fusion protein forms nanoscale clusters on cell and viral membranes that favor membrane fusion activation.</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta specific-use="meta-only"><meta-name>publishing-route</meta-name><meta-value>prc</meta-value></custom-meta></custom-meta-group></article-meta></front><body><sec id="s1" sec-type="intro"><title>Introduction</title><p>The family of <italic>Paramyxoviridae</italic> contains many clinically important viruses, such as human parainfluenza virus 1–3, measles virus, and Nipah virus (NiV). Paramyxoviruses code for two glycoproteins on the viral membranes for virus–cell membrane fusion. The receptor-binding proteins (RBP, HN/H/G) engage the host receptors and activate the refolding of the fusion protein (F) that merges the virus and cell membranes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Navaratnarajah et al., 2020</xref>). Paramyxovirus-F is a class I fusion protein, along with human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) envelope, influenza virus hemagglutinin, and severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus-2 (SARS-CoV-2) spike (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Navaratnarajah et al., 2020</xref>). Paramyxovirus-F is a trimeric transmembrane protein with a ‘tree-like’ structure at its prefusion conformation. Upon triggering by the RBP/receptor complex, paramyxovirus-F mediates fusion by inserting its N-terminal fusion peptides into the target membrane and undergoes a conformational change from pre- to post-fusion conformations, similar to other class I fusion proteins. The refolding of the paramyxovirus-F overcomes the energy barrier for membrane fusion and leads to virus–cell and cell–cell membrane fusion.</p><p>NiV is a well-studied paramyxovirus due to its capability of human–human and human–animal transmissions, high mortality, and morbidity rates, and the unavailability of vaccines or therapeutics for human use (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Haas and Lee, 2023</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">Shariff, 2019</xref>). NiV is closely related to Hendra virus, Cedar virus, and the newly identified Langya virus (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">Thibault et al., 2017</xref>). NiV-F is expressed on the cell surface as an fusion-inactive form, activated in the endosome by cathepsin B and L cleavage, and exocytosed to the cell surface as a fusion-active form (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Diederich et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Diederich et al., 2005</xref>). NiV-G binds to ephrinB2 and/or -B3 receptors in host cells and triggers the refolding of F that leads to virus–cell membrane fusion (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Negrete et al., 2005</xref>). Three complementary models of the NiV fusion activation mechanism have been proposed in the past. <italic>In the first model</italic>, the NiV-G and F form a complex before receptor engagement. The F/G interaction maintains F at a prefusion conformation. The receptor binding to G induces conformational changes in G, leading to the release and refolding of F. This model is supported by co-immunoprecipitation and conformational antibody-binding assays (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Liu et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Liu et al., 2013</xref>). <italic>In the second model</italic>, NiV-F exists as hexamer-of-trimers, and the fusion peptides are sequestered at the hexameric interface. The activation of one single trimer by the NiV-G/ephrinB2 complex can be transmitted to all six trimers via the interfaces of the hexamer-of-trimers, leading to efficient F triggering and fusion pore formation. This model is supported by the crystal structure of a GCN4-decorated NiV-F ectodomain and mutagenesis analysis of key amino acid residues at the hexameric interfaces (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib42">Xu et al., 2015</xref>). <italic>In a third model</italic>, NiV-F and G do not form a complex before receptor binding. The NiV-G/ephrinB2 engagement clusters ephrinB2 and triggers F. F triggering leads to reduced mobility of a portion of F molecules that potentially contributes to fusion pore formation. This model is supported by the nanoscale distribution of NiV-F and G on cell membranes resolved by super-resolution microscopy and a single-particle tracking assay of NiV fusion protein at the interface between supported lipid bilayer and live cell membranes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Liu et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib41">Wong et al., 2021</xref>). Although these models explain the NiV membrane fusion mechanisms from different perspectives, a link between the molecular structure and the fusion machinery on biological membranes remains unclear.</p><p>We attempted to address this link by analyzing the nano-organization of NiV-F at the prefusion state on biological membranes using single-molecule localization microscopy (SMLM) and mutagenesis analyses. We have shown that NiV-F forms clusters on biological membranes that are isolated from NiV-G (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Liu et al., 2018</xref>). Here, we show that NiV-F forms regular-sized nanoclusters on cell membranes regardless of the expression level or endosomal cleavage. The estimated size of NiV-F clusters on cell membrane is similar to that of the hexamer-of-trimer assemblies formed by the GCN4-decorated soluble NiV-F. The NiV-F nano-organization is altered by mutations at the hexameric interface and the putative oligomerization motifs at the transmembrane domain (TMD). NiV-F molecules enriched in nanoclusters favor membrane fusion activation. The NiV-F nanoclusters are stabilized by the interactions between NiV-F, the endocytosis adaptor complex AP-2, and the clathrin coat at the cell membranes. In summary, our study reveals the NiV-F nano-organization on the biological membranes and provides novel insights into the NiV fusion machinery in situ.</p></sec><sec id="s2" sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><sec id="s2-1"><title>NiV-F forms regular-sized clusters that are not affected by the surface expression level</title><p>We recently published that NiV-F formed distinctive nanoclusters on the plasma membrane regardless of the presence of NiV-G or ephrinB2 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Liu et al., 2018</xref>). To investigate the determinants of the NiV-F nano-organization, we used a custom-built SMLM to probe the NiV-F at various conditions at a 10-nm precision (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1A</xref>). SMLM generates super-resolution images by localizing spatially far-apart fluorophores with nanometer precision (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Coelho et al., 2020</xref>). PK13 cells have a flat morphology that is suitable for SMLM imaging. PK13 cells express little endogenous ephrinB2 and -B3 receptors for NiV and thus can eliminate any potential receptor-dependent clustering. Cell surface NiV-F was detected using an FLAG tag in its extracellular domain (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Liu et al., 2018</xref>). The FLAG tags were employed to detect NiV-F because of the availability of high affinity and specificity anti-FLAG antibodies for a high labeling density, which is vital for the reconstruction accuracy of SMLM images (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Dempsey et al., 2011</xref>). To rule out the effect of the FLAG tag on NiV-F clustering, we compared NiV-F clusters formed by NiV-F-FLAG to that of a NiV-F-HA construct. Both HA and FLAG tags were inserted after amino acid residue 104, right before the fusion peptide (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1B</xref>). Visual examination of the SMLM images reveals that NiV-F-FLAG and NiV-F-HA form similar clusters (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1C</xref>). The clustering tendency, indicated by Hopkins’ index, is comparable between NiV-F-HA and NiV-F-FLAG (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1D</xref>), suggesting that NiV-F clustering is not affected by specific epitope tags. To test whether the FLAG tag affects the function of NiV-F, we pseudotyped NiV-G-HA and NiV-F-FLAG or untagged NiV-F on the recombinant vesicular stomatitis virus (VSV) with glycoprotein (G) replaced by a <italic>Renilla</italic> luciferase gene (VSV-ΔG-rluc) and determined the viral entry levels (VSV/NiV pseudoviruses). The virus entry induced by NiV-F-FLAG is comparable to that of untagged NiV-F (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1E</xref>), verifying that the FLAG tag has minimal effect on the membrane fusion activity of NiV-F.</p><p>Next, we investigated whether the nano-organization of NiV-F depends on the cell surface expression (CSE) levels. The total CSE level of NiV-F in a selected cell was measured before the cell was subjected to SMLM imaging. The SMLM images show that NiV-F forms similar nanoclusters in both high- and low-expression cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1A, B</xref>). Our data show that the clustering tendency of NiV-F is independent of its CSE in individual cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1C</xref>). To gain a quantitative understanding of NiV-F nanoscale organization, we used a cluster identification method DBSCAN (Density-Based Spatial Clustering of Applications with Noise) that links the closely situated localizations in a propagative manner. We created cluster and density maps using Clus-DoC for representative high- and low-expression cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1D, E</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Pageon et al., 2016</xref>). Our data show that the estimated diameter of the NiV-F clusters ranges from 20 to 34 nm, with a peak at 24 nm (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1F</xref>). Nonetheless, the precise values of the cluster diameter are indicative rather than definite in SMLM as it could be affected by the labeling complex and the blinking property of the fluorophore. The distribution of the cluster diameter shows that ~60% of NiV-F clusters have similar sizes, indicating that NiV-F clusters maintain a quite uniform appearance. Interestingly, we noticed that the size of the clusters (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1G</xref>) and localization density (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1H</xref>) in clusters were similar between high- and low-expression cells, suggesting that the NiV-F organization in nanoclusters is not affected by the expression levels. Moreover, our data show that the high-expression cells have more clusters than the low-expression cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1I</xref>). These results suggest that changes in CSE may affect the number of NiV-F clusters on the plasma membrane (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1I</xref>), but not the clustering tendency of NiV-F (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1C</xref>), the size of the clusters (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1G</xref>), or the localization density within clusters (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1H</xref>). These data imply that the distribution and nano-organization of NiV-F are tightly regulated and may be important for membrane fusion activation. We also analyzed NiV-F distribution in different cell lines. HeLa cells express ephrinB2 and -B3, and thus are NiV permissive cells. The overall NiV-F nano-organization seems quite similar on PK13 and HeLa cells, agreeing with our previous results (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s2">Figure 1—figure supplement 2A</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Liu et al., 2018</xref>). The Hopkins’ indices are also similar for NiV-F on PK13 and HeLa cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s2">Figure 1—figure supplement 2B</xref>). The DBSCAN analysis shows that the percentage localizations in clusters (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s2">Figure 1—figure supplement 2C</xref>), the relative density defined as the ratio of the localization density in clusters to the total localization density in the selected region (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s2">Figure 1—figure supplement 2D</xref>), and cluster diameters (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s2">Figure 1—figure supplement 2E</xref>) are comparable for NiV-F on PK13 and HeLa cells. These results suggest that NiV-F clusters are minimally affected by the cell lines of expression or the presence of the ephrinB2 and/or -B3.</p><fig-group><fig id="fig1" position="float"><label>Figure 1.</label><caption><title>NiV-F forms regular-sized clusters that are not affected by the surface expression level.</title><p>Cross-section (Δ<italic>z</italic> = 600 nm) of single-molecule localization microscopy (SMLM) images of NiV-F in high-expression (<bold>A</bold>) and low-expression (<bold>B</bold>) PK13 cells.

The F<sub>1</sub>–F<sub>2</sub> is subsequently recycled to the cell surface to induce cell–cell fusion and incorporated into virus particles. We hypothesized that the F<sub>0</sub> precursor and the F<sub>1</sub>–F<sub>2</sub> active forms co-existed in the same clusters on the cell surface. To test this hypothesis, we used a pan-cysteine cathepsin inhibitor E64d to inhibit the NiV-F cleavage. E64d inhibited the cell–cell fusion induced by NiV-F and NiV-G in HeLa cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s1">Figure 2—figure supplement 1</xref>), agreeing with the previous fusion inhibitory effects in Vero and MDCK (Madin-Darby canine kidney) cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Diederich et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Diederich et al., 2005</xref>).

Our data show that clusters formed by non-cleaved NiV-F in cells treated by E64d are similar to those formed by a mixture of cleaved and non-cleaved NiV-F in the control cells, suggesting that F cleavage does not alter F clustering on the cell membrane.

Next, we investigated whether NiV-F clusters were stabilized by the hexameric interface. As reported, L53D and V108D mutants destabilize the hexameric interface and demonstrate decreased membrane fusion ability; Q393L stabilizes the hexameric interface and demonstrates increased fusion ability (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib42">Xu et al., 2015</xref>). We inserted the FLAG tag into the ectodomains of these mutants at the same position as that of the NiV-F. We verified that the relative fusion ability to their F-WT counterpart was comparable between the FLAG-tagged and untagged mutants (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s1">Figure 3—figure supplement 1A, B</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib42">Xu et al., 2015</xref>). The FLAG-tagged mutants showed similar CSE levels to NiV-F (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s1">Figure 3—figure supplement 1C</xref>). All mutants showed some levels of processing, although the cleavage of L53D was the least efficient compared to F-WT and other mutants (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s1">Figure 3—figure supplement 1D</xref>). Additionally, the FLAG-tagged NiV-F mutants showed a similar trend in virus entry as that of cell–cell fusion when pseudotyped to a recombinant VSV virus (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s1">Figure 3—figure supplement 1E, F</xref>), agreeing with the previous results obtained using the NiV-F constructs with a C-terminal AU1 tag (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib42">Xu et al., 2015</xref>). We also generated VLPs (virus-like particles) expressing NiV-M-β-lactamase (NiV-M-Bla), NiV-G-HA, and NiV-F-FLAG or mutants for an entry kinetics assay. The entry kinetics was measured in real-time by conversion of green to blue fluorescence resulting from CCF2-AM dye cleavage by the β-lactamase upon the entry of VLPs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib40">Wolf et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Landowski et al., 2014</xref>). Our results show that the hyperfusogenic mutant Q393L shows more efficient VLP entry than that of WT, while VLPs bearing the hypofusogenic mutant L53D and V108D are less efficient in entry than that of the WT (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s1">Figure 3—figure supplement 1G, H</xref>). It is noteworthy that the incorporation of NiV-G seems to be impacted by the expression of L53D in both VSV/NiV pseudovirions and VLPs (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s1">Figure 3—figure supplement 1F, H</xref>), and the deficient virus entry induced by L53D may be partly due to the decreased attachment to the target cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s1">Figure 3—figure supplement 1E, G</xref>). Nonetheless, the level of L53D on the pseudovirions and VLPs seems comparable to that of the WT (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s1">Figure 3—figure supplement 1F, H</xref>). These data support that mutations at the hexameric interface significantly impact the fusion activity of NiV-F on both cell and virus surface.</p><p>NiV-F mutants L53D, V108D, and Q393L were expressed on PK13 cells and subjected to SMLM imaging. The images show that clusters formed by L53D and V108D are smaller and more dispersed than those of the F-WT and Q393L (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3A</xref>). The Hopkin’s index for Q393L is significantly higher than that of F-WT, while the Hopkin’s indices for L53D and V108D are slightly lower than that of F-WT (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3B</xref>). Consistently, a lower percentage of L53D and V108D localizations are segregated into clusters than that of F-WT, while a similar percentage of Q393L and F-WT localizations form clusters (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3C</xref>). In addition, clusters of L53D and V108D are less packed than that of F-WT, with 48-, 49-, and 55-fold denser than the total localization density in the region, respectively (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3D</xref>). The clusters of Q393L are not significantly denser than that of F-WT (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3D</xref>). Our analysis also shows that L53D and V108D form smaller clusters compared to the F-WT (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3E</xref>). The Q393L clusters are of a similar size to that of F-WT (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3E</xref>). The total density of localizations and the total CSE levels for all constructs are comparable (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3F</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s1">Figure 3—figure supplement 1C</xref>), suggesting that differences in clustering are not due to variable numbers of localizations or levels of expression. Collectively, these data show that the mutations destabilizing the hexameric interface (L53D and V108D) make NiV-F localizations more dispersed and form smaller and less packed clusters. Q393L that stabilizes the hexameric interface promotes the clustering of NiV-F localizations (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3B</xref>) but does not significantly alter the organization and morphology of individual clusters (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3C–F</xref>). These data suggest that the NiV-F clusters are susceptible to mutations at the hexameric interface. Considering that the uniformed cluster size is similar to the assemblies formed by the soluble GCN4-NiV-F, we propose that NiV-F may organize into hexamer-of-trimer on the plasma membrane.</p><fig-group><fig id="fig3" position="float"><label>Figure 3.</label><caption><title>Mutations at the NiV-F hexameric interface affect its nano-organization.</title><p>(<bold>A</bold>) First column: Cross-section (Δ<italic>z</italic> = 600 nm) of single-molecule localization microscopy (SMLM) images of the FLAG-tagged NiV-F-WT (WT), L53D, V108D, and Q393L on PK13 cell membrane.

This agrees with their distributions on the plasma membrane (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3A</xref>). To gain a quantitative insight into the distribution of the F constructs on the three-dimensional (3D) VLPs, we used an algorithm named OPTICS (Ordering Points To Identify Clustering Structure) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Ankerst et al., 1999</xref>). To identify clusters<italic>,</italic> the OPTICS algorithm sorts out the localizations by calculating the reachability distance between two adjacent localizations in a propagative manner and generates a sequence of the ordered localizations (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Ankerst et al., 1999</xref>). In the plot of reachability distance vs. the sequence of ordered localizations, a sudden increase in the reachability distance marks the cutoff of a cluster (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s1">Figure 4—figure supplement 1A</xref>). The shade between neighboring peaks represents localizations that are classified in one cluster (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s1">Figure 4—figure supplement 1A</xref>). OPTICS can identify sub-clusters on a 3D VLP that may not be recognized by DBSCAN that uses one fixed parameter for the entire dataset (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s1">Figure 4—figure supplement 1B</xref>) shows the OPTICS plots of the localizations of F-WT and mutants on representative VLPs (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4B</xref>). The noticeable kinks suggest that F-WT and Q393L form distinctive clusters on VLPs, while the irregular, small kinks indicate that L53D and V108D are more dispersed and form smaller clusters on VLPs (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4B</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s1">Figure 4—figure supplement 1B</xref>). To gain a population insight on the nano-organization of the F constructs on VLPs, we developed a one-dimensional convolutional neural network (1D CNN) to classify the ordered sequence of reachability distances of the NiV-F localizations obtained by the OPTICS algorithm (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Kiranyaz et al., 2021</xref>). The distribution patterns of the localizations of the F-WT and Q393L partition into one category, and L53D and V108D in another (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4C</xref>). These results indicate that L53D and V108D form smaller and more dispersed clusters than F-WT and Q393L on the VLP membranes, agreeing with that of the plasma membrane (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3</xref>). Our results indicate that the trimer-trimer interaction at the hexameric interface is key in stabilizing the nano-organization of NiV-F on both cell and viral membranes, and NiV-F do not seem to rearrange during the incorporation into VLPs. Nonetheless, our data do not rule out the possibility that the association of nucleocapsids with the plasma membrane during assembly may reorganize NiV-F on the authentic virus membranes. Since the incorporation levels of NiV-M and -G varies among mutants, the nano-organization of NiV-F is likely associated with the virion incorporation or budding.</p></sec><sec id="s2-5"><title>The NiV-F clusters are dispersed upon the disruption of the interactions between TMDs</title><p>Evidence shows that TMD of class I fusion protein can self-associate in the absence of the rest of the protein and is important for membrane fusion (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Barrett and Dutch, 2020</xref>).

As the TMD domains of the NiV- and HeV-F demonstrate a 94% similarity, we mutated leucine (488 and 509) and isoleucine (495 and 502) residues of the LI zipper in NiV-F TMD to alanine (LI4A) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5s1">Figure 5—figure supplement 1A</xref>). Similar to their counterparts of HeV-F, the NiV-F-LI4A showed a decreased F processing (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5s1">Figure 5—figure supplement 1B</xref>), cell–cell fusion activity (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5s1">Figure 5—figure supplement 1C, D</xref>), and CSE levels (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5s1">Figure 5—figure supplement 1E</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">Webb et al., 2017</xref>).

Visual inspection of the images suggests that LI4A forms bigger clusters than F-WT (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5A</xref>). However, the LI4A seems less likely to cluster than F-WT, indicated by a lower Hopkin’s index (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5B</xref>). Similarly, the portion of LI4A localizations partitioned into clusters is slightly lower than that of WT (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5C</xref>). Interestingly, we noticed that clusters formed by LI4A are significantly bigger (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5D</xref>) than that of F-WT and with a similar localization density within the clusters (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5E</xref>). The data suggest that interactions between TMDs of NiV-F monomers play a role in stabilizing its nano-organization. Dissociation of TMDs by mutations may result in increased space between F monomers and thus leads to bigger clusters on the cell membrane.</p><fig-group><fig id="fig5" position="float"><label>Figure 5.</label><caption><title>Mutations in the LI zipper of the NiV-F transmembrane domain disturb the NiV-F distribution.</title><p>(<bold>A</bold>) First column: Cross-section (Δ<italic>z</italic> = 600 nm) of single-molecule localization microscopy (SMLM) images of the FLAG-tagged NiV-F-WT (WT) and NiV-F-LI4A (LI4A) mutant on PK13 cell membrane.

We hypothesize that the clustering of NiV-F is promoted by the assembly of the clathrin coat via the NiV-F–AP-2 interactions. As suggested by a yeast two-hybrid analysis, NiV-F interacts with μ1, μ2, μ3, and μ4 subunits of the AP complexes AP-1, AP-2, AP-3, and AP-4, and mutations of Y525, Y542, and Y543 almost completely abolished the interaction between AP-2 and NiV-F (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Mattera et al., 2014</xref>). Indeed, the co-immunoprecipitation assay shows that less AP2μ2 is pulled down by F-YA than that of F-WT, suggesting that F-YA has a reduced interaction with AP-2 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6s1">Figure 6—figure supplement 1H</xref>). Next, we examined the NiV-F clusters in HeLa cells treated by the endocytosis inhibitor pitstop2. Pitstop2 blocks clathrin-mediated endocytosis by obstructing the binding of the accessory protein (e.g. AP-2) and the clathrin terminal domain, and potentially preventing the assembly of the clathrin coat (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">von Kleist et al., 2011</xref>). The SMLM images (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6G</xref>) show that the NiV-F localizations are more dispersed upon pitstop2 treatment, agreeing with the lower Hopkin’s index (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6H</xref>) and a smaller percentage of localizations in clusters (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6I</xref>) in pitstop2 treated group compared to that of the control group. Interestingly, we noticed that the NiV-F clusters in pitstop2 treated cells were larger than the control cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6J</xref>), although with similar densities (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6K</xref>). The total density is consistent between the pitstop2 treated and control groups (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6L</xref>). The overall dispersed NiV-F distribution upon pitstop2 treatment may potentially be caused by the disrupted assembly of clathrin coat. In combination, these results suggest that the enrichment of NiV-F by AP-2 and the subsequent assembly of the clathrin-coated endosomes are important in stabilizing the F clusters on cell membranes. We envision that the endocytosis components may also facilitate the NiV-F clustering in virus particles as previous proteomic studies show the presence of endocytosis related proteins, such as clathrin, AP-2, and dynamin in NiV VLPs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Johnston et al., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Pentecost et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">Vera-Velasco et al., 2018</xref>).</p></sec></sec><sec id="s3" sec-type="discussion"><title>Discussion</title><p>Here, we used SMLM to resolve the arrangement and organization of NiV-F on the biological membranes at a precision of 10 nm. Our data support the following conclusions: (1) NiV-F is organized into nanoclusters on the biological membranes and this organization is independent of the protein expression level or endosomal cleavage; (2) the NiV-F nano-organization is susceptible to mutations at the trimer interface on the NiV-F ectodomain and the putative oligomerization motif on the TMD; (3) NiV-F sequestered in nanoclusters favors membrane fusion activation; (4) the interactions among NiV-F, the AP-2 complex, and the clathrin coat assembly stabilize the NiV-F clusters. We propose that the NiV-F nanoclusters are the fundamental unit of the NiV fusion machinery, and this organization facilitates membrane fusion triggering by a mixed population of NiV-F molecules with varied degrees of cleavage and opportunities of interacting with NiV-G/receptor complex.</p><p>The nano-organization of NiV-F informs the coordinated membrane fusion triggering by a mixed population of NiV-F. This notion is supported by the following observations from this and previous studies: (1) NiV-F molecules form distinctive, regular-sized nanoclusters on the cell and virus membranes (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1A–E</xref>); (2) the cleaved, active F co-exist with the non-cleaved, inactive F in a nanocluster, as suggested by that the NiV-F nanoclusters are resistant to the cathepsin inhibitor, E64d (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2</xref>); (3) the NiV-F and G are segregated into different clusters (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Liu et al., 2018</xref>); and (4) the full-length NiV-F and -G proteins do not show stable interactions either before or after ephrinB2 activation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib41">Wong et al., 2021</xref>). These observations indicate that the NiV-F triggering may be a result of transient interactions between the F molecules at the edge of the clusters with the adjacent ephrinB2/G complex. Moreover, we observed that the NiV-F sequestering into clusters is favorable for membrane fusion activation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figures 3</xref>—<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">5</xref>), highlighting the importance of the spatial arrangement of NiV-F in its fusion activity. Therefore, it is likely that the triggered, fusion-active NiV-F at the cluster peripheral can facilitate other F molecules in the same cluster to fulfill the conformational changes, and thus maximize the energy to merge the opposing membranes. In contrast, the correlation between the clustering pattern of NiV-F and its incorporation into virions is not obvious. Although the YA and LI4A mutants that showed aberrant clusters cannot incorporate into VSV/NiV pseudovirions (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5s1">Figure 5—figure supplement 1F</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6s1">Figure 6—figure supplement 1F</xref>), the clustering-deficient hexameric interface mutants L53D and V108D were incorporated into VLPs (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4A</xref>) and VSV/NiV pseudovirisons (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s1">Figure 3—figure supplement 1F</xref>), comparable to that of NiV-F-WT. Therefore, the significance of NiV-F clustering for assembly and budding of the virions may be context dependent.</p><p>A previous study revealed a hexamer-of-trimer assembly of soluble, GCN4-decorated, prefusion NiV-F. Using SMLM, we estimated that the NiV-F clusters on the cell plasma membrane had a diameter between 24 and 26 nm (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1F</xref>). This estimation agrees with the size of the hexameric soluble NiV-F-GCN4 assemblies (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib42">Xu et al., 2015</xref>). Notably, the density of clusters (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1I</xref>), but not the size and localization density of individual clusters (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1G, H</xref>), is affected by the surface expression levels of NiV-F, implying that the NiV-F clusters are highly regulated. A collaborative effort of multiple copies of viral envelope proteins is favorable for receptor binding and overcoming the energy barrier for membrane fusion. Nanoclusters formed by viral glycoproteins have been observed for HIV-1 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Chojnacki and Eggeling, 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Muranyi et al., 2013</xref>), Herpes virus (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Laine et al., 2018</xref>), and influenza virus (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">McMahon et al., 2023</xref>). The viral restriction factor, serine incorporator protein 5 (SERINC5), inhibits HIV-1 fusion by disrupting the HIV env nanoclusters, highlighting the importance of the nanoclusters in the function of the viral glycoproteins (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Chen et al., 2020</xref>). More interestingly, the NiV-F distribution becomes more dispersed, characterized by smaller and less dense clusters, upon the mutation of two key residues, L53 and V108, at the hexameric interface, suggesting that the NiV-F clusters are likely to be the hexamer-of-trimer assemblies on the cell and viral membranes (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figures 3</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">4</xref>).</p><p>The hexamer-of-trimer NiV-F is observed on the VLP surface by electron tomography (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib42">Xu et al., 2015</xref>). The NiV-F hexamer-of-trimers are arranged into a soccer ball-like structure, with one trimer being part of multiple hexamer-of-trimers. Nonetheless, the hexagonal lattice has been reported for heamagglutinin-esterase-fusion (HEF) proteins on the surface of the influenza C virus (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Halldorsson et al., 2021</xref>) and Env glycoprotein on the Foamy virus (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Effantin et al., 2016</xref>). The sharing of one trimer among hexamer-of-trimers and conformational arrangements in the ectodomain of viral glycoproteins were shown to stabilize the contacts for lattice formation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib42">Xu et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Halldorsson et al., 2021</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Effantin et al., 2016</xref>). In our study, the NiV-F clusters observed on the cell plasma membrane are more likely to be individual hexamer-of-trimers estimated by size (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1</xref>). We speculate that the formation of the hexagonal lattice may be a result of increased concentration of NiV-F on VLP membrane. A study on measles virus shows only limited high order of MeV-F assemblies at some virus assembly sites in recMeV-(H-118 ∇41×) cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Ke et al., 2018</xref>), however, we have not observed increased NiV-F localizations at NiV-M-positive membrane domains on the cell body of NiV-M, F, and G co-expression PK13 cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Liu et al., 2015</xref>). Therefore, the formation of NiV-F lattice on the VLP membrane may occur either at a late stage of virus assembly or after budding. Additionally, cellular factors may also play a role in maintaining individual NiV-F hexamer-of-trimers on the plasma membrane, as a proteomic analysis reveals that NiV-F is an interacting partner of many vesicular trafficking and actin cytoskeleton factors (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Johnston et al., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">Vera-Velasco et al., 2018</xref>).</p><p>We also identified that the endosomal components as key host factors in maintaining the NiV-F nano-organization on the cell membrane. Our data suggest that both the disruption of the F/AP-2 interaction and the inhibition of clathrin assembly by pitstop2 result in dispersed NiV-F distribution. AP-2 is the key adaptor of clathrin-mediated endocytosis. It binds cargo and PtdIns(4,5)P<sub>2</sub>-containing membrane via multiple interface, and undergoes conformational changes to append to the clathrin lattice (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">von Kleist et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Kovtun et al., 2020</xref>). Our data indicate that AP-2-NiV-F interaction can enrich and strengthen the F nanoclusters (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6A–F</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6s1">Figure 6—figure supplement 1H</xref>), and potentially facilitate the uptake of NiV-F by endocytosis for endosomal cleavage and activation. It is reported that the clustering of CD44, modulated by <italic>N</italic>-glycosylations, facilitates the uptake of CD44 by endocytosis. Furthermore, the assembly of the clathrin coat at the plasma membrane may also strengthen the F clusters, because pitstop2 that inhibits the clathrin-coat assembly by blocking the clathrin terminal domain (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">von Kleist et al., 2011</xref>) prevents the cluster formation of NiV-F. It is plausible that both clathrin and AP-2 facilitate NiV-F clustering on cell and virus membranes because of the similar organization of F on virus and cell membranes and the presence of clathrin and AP-2 in VLPs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Johnston et al., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">Vera-Velasco et al., 2018</xref>).</p><p>In conclusion, our observations provide direct evidence on the nano-organization and distribution of NiV-F on the cell and viral membranes and shed lights to the fusion activation mechanisms. Therefore, it would be critical to elucidate host factors that maintain NiV-F clusters and the interacting motif in NiV-F, which may represent a new therapeutic strategy for NiV infections. It would also be interesting to analyze the reorganization of the NiV-F clusters upon triggering by the NiV-G/receptor complex on live cell membranes by combining single-molecule imaging and the supported lipid bilayer technologies (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib41">Wong et al., 2021</xref>). Additionally, a precise stoichiometry of individual NiV-F clusters on the cell and virus membranes could facilitate the vaccine design.</p></sec><sec id="s4" sec-type="materials|methods"><title>Materials and methods</title><table-wrap id="keyresource" position="anchor"><label>Key resources table</label><table frame="hsides" rules="groups"><thead><tr><th align="left" valign="bottom">Reagent type (species) or resource</th><th align="left" valign="bottom">Designation</th><th align="left" valign="bottom">Source or reference</th><th align="left" valign="bottom">Identifiers</th><th align="left" valign="bottom">Additional information</th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td align="left" valign="bottom">Cell line (<italic>Homo sapiens</italic>)</td><td align="left" valign="bottom">HEK293T</td><td align="left" valign="bottom">ATCC</td><td align="left" valign="bottom">CRL-3216</td><td align="left" valign="bottom"/></tr><tr><td align="left" valign="bottom">Cell line (<italic>Sus scrofa</italic>, pig)</td><td align="left" valign="bottom">PK13</td><td align="left" valign="bottom">ATCC</td><td align="left" valign="bottom">CRL-6489</td><td align="left" valign="bottom"/></tr><tr><td align="left" valign="bottom">Cell line (<italic>Homo sapiens</italic>)</td><td align="left" valign="bottom">HeLa</td><td align="left" valign="bottom">ATCC</td><td align="left" valign="bottom">CCL-2</td><td align="left" valign="bottom"/></tr><tr><td align="left" valign="bottom">Cell line (<italic>Cercopithecus aethiops</italic>)</td><td align="left" valign="bottom">Vero</td><td align="left" valign="bottom">ATCC</td><td align="left" valign="bottom">CCL-81</td><td align="left" valign="bottom"/></tr><tr><td align="left" valign="bottom">Recombinant DNA reagent</td><td align="left" valign="bottom">pcDNA 3 plasmids containing cDNA for NiV-F-FLAG and mutants</td><td align="left" valign="bottom">This paper</td><td align="left" valign="bottom"/><td align="left" valign="bottom">The FLAG tag was inserted after residue 104 of the codon-optimized NiV-F (GenBank accession no.

Imaging was performed on a custom-built SMLM. Briefly, the microscope was built upon an apochromatic TIRF oil-immersion objective lens (Nikon, 60×; numerical aperture 1.49). Four lasers were used for excitation: a 639-nm laser (MRL-FN-639, 500 mW) for exciting Alexa Fluor 647, a 532-nm laser (MGL-III-532-300 mW) for exciting cy3B, a 488-nm laser (MBL-F-473-300 mW) for exciting GFP, and a 405 nm laser (MDL-III-405-100 mW) for reactivating Alexa Fluor 647 and cy3B. For SMLM imaging, the exciting and reactivating lasers were combined into a single path using dichroic mirrors and then expanded and collimated using a beam expander. The incident light beam was focused on the back focal plane of the objective lens. A translation stage allowed the beam to be shifted between the center and edge of the objective lens so that the incident light emerging from the objective lens reaches the sample at various angles. For SMLM imaging of NiV-F at the cell and virus membranes at the cell-coverslip contact, the incident angle of the illumination light was adjusted to near or greater than the critical angle of the water–glass interface to allow total internal reflection and ensure low background fluorescence for single fluorophore detection (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Bates et al., 2013</xref>). The emission fluorescence was separated using appropriate dichroic mirrors and filters (Semrock) and detected by electron-multiplying charge-coupled devices (Ixon, Andor). The full width at half maxima of the image of the point spread function was magnified in size to ~3 camera pixels (106 nm per pixel), ensuring the optimal fluorophore localization (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Bates et al., 2013</xref>). A feedback loop, composed of a tracking camera (Andor Zyla SCOMS camera) and a computer-controlled piezo stage (Thorlabs 3-Axis NanoMax 300), was employed to control the sample drift to &lt;1 nm laterally and 2.5 nm axially (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Tafteh et al., 2016</xref>.)</p><p>Before SMLM imaging, fluorescence beads (Life technologies, F8799) were added to samples as fiducial markers for drift control. Samples were immersed in imaging buffer [TN buffer (50 mM Tris (pH 8.0) and 10 mM NaCl), 0.5 mg/ml glucose oxidase, 40 μg/ml catalase, 10% glucose, and 50 mM mercaptoethylamine] (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Dempsey et al., 2011</xref>). The expression level of the protein of interest in individual cells was determined by measuring the average emission fluorescence intensity of an area of 27 × 27 μm<sup>2</sup>. To ensure sample stability during SMLM, a fiducial marker was continuously tracked by the tracking camera. A brief procedure for SMLM imaging is described as follows: (1) the sample was exposed to the imaging light beam [639 nm laser (1 kW/cm<sup>2</sup>)] at a 90° incident angle to cause a subset of the fluorophores to switch to the fluorescent state; (2) the incident light angle was adjusted close to or at the critical angle at the water–glass interface to achieve total internal reflection; (3) a low density of activated fluorophores were recorded to avoid fluorophore overlap; (4) another subset of fluorophores was stochastically activated by exposure to the activation light (405 nm). This process was repeated until 40,000 images were acquired. Custom-written software in MATLAB (Mathworks) was used to identify activated fluorophores in each image, determine their precise locations by Gaussian fitting, and reconstruct SMLM images (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Bates et al., 2013</xref>). Briefly, each image was first convolved with a Gaussian kernel to remove noise and background, and thresholded to search for local maxima. Next, two fitting steps were applied to determine the peak center position, the amplitude, and the width. Then, filtering and trail generation were combined to remove erroneous peaks and group multiple peaks originating from one activated fluorophore. Lastly, a list of fluorophore positions was reconstructed into an SMLM image. Clusters of NiV-F localizations on cell surface resolved by SMLM were identified and characterized using ClusDoC (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Pageon et al., 2016</xref>).

At 48 hr posttransfection, the supernatant of the cell culture was collected and subjected to ultracentrifugation on a 20% sucrose cushion at 125, 392 rcf for 90 min. The VLP-containing pellets were resuspended in 5% sucrose-NTE buffer. VLPs were bound to 2.5 μg fibronectin-coated 18 mm coverslips at 4°C overnight, followed by fixation using PBS containing 4% PFA and 0.2% glutaraldehyde. The protocols of immunofluorescence, SMLM setup, and SMLM imaging for cells were followed to stain and image NiV-F-FLAG and mutants on VLPs using SMLM. A widefield image of GFP was acquired and superimposed on the SMLM image of NiV-F. VLPs were identified as GFP-positive particles. The distribution of NiV-F localizations on VLPs was analyzed by using a custom-written OPTICS algorithm based on C++ and Point Cloud Library. Briefly, OPTICS segregates closely situated data points into clusters from a 3D SMLM dataset (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Ankerst et al., 1999</xref>).

If the number of neighbors of point A is larger than the user-defined minPts (set at 10), the algorithm outputs point A without a reachability-distance value. Next, OPTICS obtains point A’s nearest neighbor (point B) and outputs the B–A reachability-distance value. Point B is the new starting point. OPTICS recalculates the reachability distance of all unprocessed neighbors of point B and selects the next point to process, as described above. This process repeats until all points in the dataset have been visited. The final output of OPTICS is a sequence of reachability distances for each point.</p><p>The classification of the ordered sequence of reachability distances was performed by using custom-written 1D CNN based on Python and Tensorflow. Briefly, CNN extracts features from OPTICS output dataset by using convolutional layers for subsequent classification of the space information hidden in the OPTICS datasets. The convolutional layers use a 1D sliding window to slide along the sequence data (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib43">Yu et al., 2014</xref>). Each sliding window captures local information and passes it to the next layer. Multiple CNN layers work sequentially to build a high-dimensional representation of the dataset. A fully connected layer that transforms high-dimensional features into classification results is achieved by CNN convolution. We use t-SNE (t-distributed stochastic neighbor embedding) to reduce dimensionality on a trained neural network layer for visualization in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4C</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Kobak and Berens, 2019</xref>.</p></sec><sec id="s4-5"><title>Sodium dodecyl sulfate–polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis and western blot analysis and co-immunoprecipitation</title><p>For western blot analysis to confirm the expression of NiV-F-FLAG and mutants, HEK293T cells were seeded in 6-well plate and transfected with 2.5 μg pcDNA3.1 empty vector, NiV-F-FLAG, or mutants.

The use of a FLAG tag in the extracellular domain should be validated and compared with the unlabelled WT NiV-F when expressed in functional pseudoviruses (for example HIV-1 based particles decorated with NiV-F). This experiment should also be carried out for both infection and fusion (including BlaM-Vpr as a readout for fusion). I would also suggest to run a time-of-addition BlaM experiment to understand how this particular labelling strategy affects single virion fusion as compared to the the WT.</p></disp-quote><p>We thank reviewer #2 for this suggestion. We have made various efforts to validate the expression and function of FLAG-tagged NiV-F. The NiV-F-FLAG shows comparable cell surface expression levels and induces similar cell-cell fusion levels in 293T cells as that of untagged NiV-F 1. The NiV-F-FLAG also showed similar levels of virus entry as untagged NiV-F when both were pseudotyped on a recombinant Vesicular Stomatitis Virus (VSV) with the VSV glycoprotein replaced by a <italic>Renilla</italic> luciferase reporter gene (VSV-ΔG-rLuc; Fig. S1D). We also performed a virus entry kinetics assay using NiV VLPs expressing NiV-M-βlactamase (NiV-M-Bla), NiV-G-HA, and NiV-F-FLAG, NiV-F-AU1 or untagged NiV-F. The intracellular AU1 tag is located at the C-terminus of NiV-F (Genbank accession no. AY816748.1). However, we detected different levels of NiV-M-Bla in equal volume of VLPs, suggesting that the tags in NiV-F affect the budding of the VLPs (Author response image 2A). Therefore, we performed fusion kinetics assay by using VLPs expressing the same levels of NiV-M-Bla. Among them, the NiV-F-FLAG on VLPs shows the most efficient fusion between VLP and HEK293T cell membranes (Author response image 2B), significantly more efficient than that of untagged NiV-F and NiV-FAU1. However, we cannot attribute the enhanced fusion activity to the FLAG tag, because the readout of this assay relies on both the levels of β-lactamase (introduced by NiV-M-Bla in VLPs) and the NiV-F constructs. The tags in NiV-F could affect both the budding of VLPs and the stoichiometry of F and M in individual VLPs. We did not use the HIV-based pseudovirus system because the incorporation of NiV-F into HIV pseudoviruses requires a C-terminal deletion 2,3.</p><p>In summary, the FLAG tag does not affect cell-cell fusion 1 and virus entry when pseudotyped to the recombinant VSV-ΔG-rLuc viruses (Fig. S1D). Given that we do not observe any difference in clustering between an HA- and FLAG-tagged NiV-F constructs on PK13 cell surface (Fig. S1A-C), we conclude that the FLAG tag has minimal effect on both the fusion activity and the nanoscale distribution of NiV-F.</p><fig id="sa4fig2" position="float"><label>Author response image 2.</label><caption><title>Viral entry is not affected by labeling of NiV-F.</title><p>(A) Western blot analysis of NiV-M-Bla in NiV-VLPs generated by HEK293T cells expressing NiV-M-Bla, NiV-G-HA and NiV-F-FLAG, untagged NiV-F, or NiV-F-AU1.

Only cell-cell fusion assays are shown in supplementary figures and clearly, single virus entry and fusion cannot be compared with the biophysics of cell-cell fusion. Not only the environment is completely different, membrane curvature and the number of NiV-F drastically varies also. Therefore, specific fusion assays (either single virus tracking and/or time-of-addition BlaM kinetics with functional pseudoviruses) are needed to substantiate this claim.</p></disp-quote><p>We thank Reviewer 2 for the suggestion. To support the link between F clustering and viruscell membrane fusion, we conducted pseudotyped virus entry and VLP fusion kinetics assays, as shown in revised Figure S4. The viral entry results (Fig. S4 E and F) corroborate that of the cell-cell fusion assay (Fig. S4A and B) and previously published data 4. The fusion kinetics confirmed that the real-time fusion kinetics was affected by mutations at the hexameric interface, with the hypo-fusogenic mutants L53D and V108D exhibited reduced entry efficiency while the hyper-fusogenic mutant Q393L showed increased efficiency (Fig. S4G and H). The results were described in detail in the revised manuscript.</p><p>Additionally, we performed a pseudotyped virus entry assay on the LI4A (Fig. S6F and G) and YA (Fig. S7F and G) mutants to verify the function of these mutants on viruses in revised Supplemental Figures. Neither LI4A nor YA incorporated into the VSV/NiV pseudotyped viruses as shown by the Western blot analyses of the pseudovirions (Fig. S6F and S7F), and thus did not induce virus entry, consisting with the cell-cell fusion results (Fig. S6C, D and Fig. S7C, D). We did not perform the entry kinetic assay of these two mutants as they do not incorporate into VLPs or pseudovirions.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>The authors also claim they could not characterize the number of NiV-F particles per cluster. Another technique such as number and brightness (Digman et al., 2008) could support current SMLM data and identify the number of single molecules per cluster. Also, this technology does not require complex microscopy apparatus. I suggest they perform either confocal fluorescence fluctuation spectroscopy or TIRF-based nandb to validate the clusters and identify how many molecule are present in these clusters.</p></disp-quote><p>We thank reviewer 2 for this suggestion. Determining the true copy number of NiV-F in individual clusters could verify whether the F clusters on the plasma membrane are hexamer-of-trimer assemblies. Regardless, it does not affect our conclusion that the organization of NiV-F into nanoclusters affects the membrane fusion triggering ability. The confocal fluorescence fluctuation spectroscopy (FFS) and TIRF-based analyses are accessible tools for quantifying fluorophore copy numbers and/or stoichiometry based on fluorescence fluctuation or photobleaching. However, these methods are unable to quantify the number of proteins in individual clusters because they analyze fluorophores either in the entire cell (as in wide-field epifluorescence microscopy coupled with FFS and TIRF-coupled photobleaching) 5–7 or within a large excitation volume (confocal laser scanning microscopycoupled FFS) 8. Both of these volumes are significantly larger than a single NiV-F cluster, which has an average diameter of 24-26 nm (Fig. 1F).</p><p>The current SMLM setup is useful for characterizing the protein distribution and organization. However, quantifying the true protein copy number within a nanocluster is challenging because of the stochasticity of fluorophore blinking and the unknown labeling stoichiometry 9–11. To address the challenge in fluorophore blinking, quantitative DNA-PAINT (qDNA-PAINT) may be used because the on-off frequency of the fluorophores is tied to the well-defined kinetic constants of DNA binding and the influx rate of the imager strands, rather than the stochasticity of fluorophore blinking. Thus, the frequency of blinks can be translated to protein counting 12. To address the challenge in unknown labeling stoichiometry, DNA origami can be used as a calibration standard 11. DNA origami supports handles at a regular space with several to tens of nanometers apart, and the handles can be conjugated with a certain number of proteins of interest. The copy number of protein interest in the experimental group can be determined by comparing the SMLM localization distribution of the sample to that of the DNA origami calibration standard. Given the requirement of a more sophisticated SMLM setup and a high-precision calibration tool, we will explore the quantification of NiV-F copy numbers in nanoclusters in a future project.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Also, it is not clear how many cells the authors employ for their statistics at least 30-50 cells should be employed and not consider the number of events blinking events. I hope the authors are not considering only a single cell to run their stats... The differences between the mutants and the NiV-F is minor even if their statistical analyses give a difference (they should average the number and size of the clusters per cell for a total of 30-50 cells with experiments performed at least in three different cells following the same protocol). Overall, it seems that the authors have only evaluated a very low number of cells.</p></disp-quote><p>We disagree with this comment from Reviewer #2.

We showed that the organization of NiV envelope proteins on the VLP membrane is similar in the presence or absence of NiV-M by direct visualization 27, suggesting that the effect of NiV-M on F-WT clustering on VLPs is minimal. We also show comparable incorporation of NiV-F among the NiV-F hexamer-oftrimer mutants (Fig. 4A). Therefore, we did not test the F clustering at different F, M, and G combinations in this paper.

We did not focus on the role of NiV-F clusters for budding in the current manuscript, although this is an interesting topic to pursue. In this manuscript, we observed that NiV VLP budding is decreased for some cluster-disrupting mutants, such as F-YA, and F-LI4A. however, F-V108D showed increased budding compared to F-WT (Fig. 4A). We also observed that VLPs and VSV/NiV pseudoviruses expressing L53D have little NiV-G (Fig. 4A, Fig. S4F and S4H), although the incorporation level of L53D is comparable to that of wt F in both VLPs and pseudovirions (Fig. 4A and Fig. S4F). L53D is a hypofusogenic mutant with decreased clustering ability. Therefore, our current data do not show a clear link between F clustering and NiV VLP budding or glycoprotein incorporation.</p><p>We reported that both NiV-F and -M form clusters at the plasma membrane although NiV-F clusters are not enriched at the NiV-M positive membrane domains 1. This result indicates that NiV-M is the major driving force for assembly and budding, while NiV-F is passively incorporated into the assembly sites. The central role of NiV-M in budding is also supported by a recent study showing that NiV-M induces membrane curvature by binding to PI(4,5)P2 in the inner leaflet of the plasma membrane 28. However, the expression of NiV-F alone induces the production of vesicles bearing NiV-F 29 and NiV-F recruits vesicular trafficking and actin cytoskeleton factors to VLPs either alone or in combination with NiV-G and -M, indicating a potential autonomous role in budding 30. Additionally, several electron microscopy studies show that the paramyxovirus F forms 2D lattice interspersed above the M lattice, suggesting the participation of F in virus assembly and budding. Nonetheless, the evidence above suggests that NiV-F may play a role in budding, but our data cannot correlate NiV-F clustering to budding.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Assuming that the clusters are important for entry, hexameric clusters are not unique to Nipah virus F. Similar hexameric clusters have been described for the HEF on influenza virus C particles (Halldorsson et al 2021) and env organization on Foamy virus particles (Effantin et al 2016), both with specific interactions between trimers. What is the organization of F on Nipah virus particles? If F requires to be hexameric for entry, this should be easily imaged by EM on infectious or inactivated virus particles.</p></disp-quote><p>We thank reviewer #3 for this suggestion. The hexamer-of-trimer NiV-F is observed on the VLP surface by electron tomography 4. The NiV-F hexamer-of-trimers are arranged into a soccer ball-like structure, with one trimer being part of multiple hexamer-of-trimers. The implication of NiV-F clusters in virus entry and the potential mechanism for NiV-F higherorder structure formation are discussed in the revised manuscripts.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>AP stabilization of the F clusters is curious if the clusters are solely required for entry? Virus entry does not recruit the clathrin machinery. Is it possible that F clusters are endocytosed in the absence of budding?</p></disp-quote><p>We thank reviewer #3 for this question. The evidence from the current study does not exclude the role of NiV-F clustering in virus budding. NiV-F is known to be endocytosed in the virus-producing cells for cleavage by Cathepsin B or L at endocytic compartments at a pH-dependent manner31–33 in the absence of budding. However, given that all cleaved and uncleaved NiV-F have an endocytosis signal sequence at the cytoplasmic tail and are able to interact with AP-2 for endosome assembly and the cleaved and uncleaved F may have similar clustering patterns (Fig. 2), we do not think NiV-F clustering is specifically regulated for the cleavage of NiV-F. A plausible hypothesis is that NiV-F clusters are stabilized by multiple intrinsic factors (e.g. trimer interface) and host factors (e.g. AP-2) on cell membrane for cell-cell fusion and virus budding. We linked the clustering to the fusion ability of NiV-F in this study, but the NiV-F clustering may also be important in facilitating virus budding. Once in the viruses, the higher-order assembly of the clusters (<italic>e.g.</italic> lattice) may form due to protein enrichment, and the cell factors may not be the major maintenance force.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Clusters are required for budding.</p><p>Other points:</p><p>Fig. 3: Some of the V108D and L53D clusters look similar in size than wt clusters.
