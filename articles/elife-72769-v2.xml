Studies of cell-type-restricted transcription factors have illuminated the mechanisms by which spatial and temporal regulation of gene expression gives rise to identifiable neuronal subtypes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Doe, 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Fishell and Kepecs, 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">Hobert and Kratsios, 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib65">Sagner and Briscoe, 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib79">Venkatasubramanian and Mann, 2019</xref>). A parallel and critical mechanism of gene regulation is through the post-translational modification of histones, which enables and restricts transcription by modifying chromatin structure (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib45">Kishi and Gotoh, 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib66">Schuettengruber et al., 2017</xref>). The Polycomb group (PcG) is key family of histone-associated proteins that play evolutionarily conserved roles in restricting gene expression during development (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Blackledge et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">Gentile and Kmita, 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib69">Simon and Kingston, 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib71">Soshnikova and Duboule, 2009</xref>). In embryonic stem cells, cell fate determinants are repressed through PRC activities, and PRC-associated histone marks are subsequently removed from loci as cells differentiate (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Boyer et al., 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Farcas et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib76">Tavares et al., 2012</xref>). PRC repression is maintained through cell division and after differentiation and is thought to contribute to stable cellular memories of early patterning events (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Ciabrelli et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Coleman and Struhl, 2017</xref>). In vertebrates, much of our knowledge of how PRCs regulate gene expression has emerged from biochemical studies of PcG proteins or from the activity of these factors in proliferating cells. Despite an in depth understanding of the mechanisms of PRC action, how PcG proteins interact with gene regulatory networks in the CNS remains poorly understood.</p><p>The specification of neuronal fates in the vertebrate spinal cord provides a tractable system to elucidate the function of PcG proteins, as the pathways that determine identities are well-defined, and the molecular signatures of many subtypes are known (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Butler and Bronner, 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib65">Sagner and Briscoe, 2019</xref>). One neuronal class where fate specification has been closely examined is the spinal MN. A core set of transcription factors, including Mnx1, Isl1/2, and Lhx3, determines class-specific features of MNs, including neurotransmitter identity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib68">Shirasaki and Pfaff, 2002</xref>). The subsequent diversification of MNs into hundreds of muscle-specific subtypes is achieved through a conserved network of Hox transcription factors differentially expressed along the rostrocaudal axis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib59">Philippidou and Dasen, 2013</xref>). During neural tube patterning, opposing gradients of retinoic acid (RA) and fibroblast growth factors (FGFs) provide spinal progenitors with a positional identity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Bel-Vialar et al., 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Dasen et al., 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib47">Liu et al., 2001</xref>). These morphogens act, in part, by temporally and spatially depleting Polycomb-associated histone marks from <italic>Hox</italic> clusters (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib52">Mazzoni et al., 2013</xref>). As progenitors exit the cell cycle, MNs continue to express <italic>Hox</italic> genes, where they regulate repertoires of subtype-specific genes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Catela et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Dasen et al., 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib53">Mendelsohn et al., 2017</xref>). Although the role of Hox proteins in the CNS are well-characterized (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib57">Parker and Krumlauf, 2020</xref>), and are known targets of PRC activities (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">Gentile and Kmita, 2020</xref>), the specific contributions of PRC1 and PRC2 to CNS maturation remain unclear, as few studies have directly compared their functions during embryonic development.</p><p>Polycomb repression is initiated by PRC2, which methylates histone H3 at lysine-27 (H3K27me3), permitting recruitment of PRC1 through subunits that recognize this mark, leading to chromatin compaction at genes targeted for repression (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib51">Margueron and Reinberg, 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib66">Schuettengruber et al., 2017</xref>). In embryonic stem (ES) cells, <italic>Hox</italic> gene clusters are initially covered by H3K27me3 and loss of PRC2 function leads to reduced PRC1 binding and ectopic <italic>Hox</italic> expression (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Boyer et al., 2006</xref>). During mouse development, H3K27me3 marks are progressively removed from <italic>Hox</italic> clusters, allowing for the temporal and spatial activation of more caudal <italic>Hox</italic> genes during axis extension (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib71">Soshnikova and Duboule, 2009</xref>). The progressive removal of PRC2-associated histone marks is also recapitulated in ES cell-derived MNs (ESC-MNs), where RA functions to deplete H3K27me3 from rostral <italic>Hox1-Hox5</italic> paralogs, while FGF removes H3K27me3 from more caudal <italic>Hox</italic> genes through Cdx proteins (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib52">Mazzoni et al., 2013</xref>). Although loss of PRC2 affects the viability of ESC-MNs, a hypomorphic mutation in the PRC2 component <italic>Suz12</italic> leads to ectopic <italic>Hox</italic> expression (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib52">Mazzoni et al., 2013</xref>). Thus, during early phases of embryonic development, PRC2 appears to have a critical role in establishing the early profiles of <italic>Hox</italic> expression in MNs along the rostrocaudal axis.</p><p>PRC1 and PRC2 can also exist in a variety of configurations, which may contribute to neuronal subtype-specific activities. The core subunit of PRC1, Ring1, binds to one of six Polycomb group Ring finger (Pcgf) proteins (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Gao et al., 2012</xref>). PRC1 containing Pcgf4 interacts with Cbx proteins (canonical PRC1) which recognize H3K27me3 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Bernstein et al., 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib56">Morey et al., 2012</xref>). Variant forms of PRC1 containing Rybp can inhibit incorporation of Cbx proteins into PRC1, and bind target loci independent of H3K27me3 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib76">Tavares et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib81">Wang et al., 2010</xref>). We previously found that a PRC1 component, Pcgf4 (Bmi1), is required to establish rostral boundaries of <italic>Hox</italic> expression in differentiating MNs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">Golden and Dasen, 2012</xref>). By contrast, deletion of a core PRC2 component, <italic>Ezh2</italic>, from MN progenitors had no apparent impact on fate specification, possibly due to compensation by <italic>Ezh1</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib67">Shen et al., 2008</xref>), or through use of variant PRC1 containing Rybp. These observations raise the question of what are the specific roles of canonical PRC1, variant PRC1, and PRC2 during MN subtype diversification.</p><p>To determine the function of PRCs during neural differentiation, we removed core components of these complexes from MN progenitors. We found that depletion of Ring1 proteins, essential constituents of all PRC1 complexes, causes pronounced changes in transcription factor expression and a loss of Hox-dependent MN subtypes. By contrast, neither PRC2 nor variant PRC1 activities are required to maintain rostrocaudal positional identities at the time of MN differentiation. Deletion of <italic>Ring1</italic> leads to increased chromatin accessibility and derepression of a broad variety of cell fate determinants, while class-specific features of MNs are preserved. The derepression of caudal <italic>Hox</italic> genes in <italic>Ring1</italic> mutants leads to the suppression of MN subtype diversification programs. These findings indicate that PRC1 function is essential during terminal differentiation to specify the transcriptional identities of motor neurons.</p></sec><sec id="s2" sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><sec id="s2-1"><title>PRC1 is essential for rostrocaudal patterning during neuronal differentiation</title><p>To determine the relative contributions of PRC1 and PRC2 to neuronal specification, we analyzed mice in which core subunit-encoding genes were selectively removed from MN progenitors. <italic>Ezh</italic> genes encode the methyltransferase activity of PRC2, while <italic>Eed</italic> is required to enhance this function.

Classically, PcG-mediated repression is thought to depend on recruitment of PRC1 through recognition of histone methylation marks deposited by PRC2 activity. Although alternative, H3K27me3-independent, mechanisms of PRC1 repression have been described (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib76">Tavares et al., 2012</xref>), the relative contribution of PRC1 and PRC2 to neuronal fate specification have not been resolved. In this study, we found that genetic depletion of PRC2 components has no discernable impact on neural class or subtype diversification programs at the time of MN differentiation. By contrast, a core PRC1 subunit, Ring1, is required to restrict transcription factor expression in the CNS, maintain neuronal subtype-specific chromatin topology, and determine rostrocaudal boundaries of <italic>Hox</italic> expression. Our findings indicate PRC1 plays a key role in regulating expression of cell fate determinants during MN differentiation, safeguarding neurons from acquiring inappropriate gene regulatory programs.</p><sec id="s3-1"><title>PRC functions in Neural development</title><p>Polycomb proteins function in diverse aspects of CNS maturation, including the temporal transition from neurogenesis to gliogenesis, maintenance of adult neural stem cell fates, and restriction of gene expression in mature neurons (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Di Meglio et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Fasano et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">Hirabayashi et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib55">Molofsky et al., 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib80">von Schimmelmann et al., 2016</xref>). The role of PRCs in neural subtype diversification has been challenging to study, in part, due the complexity and dynamic temporal regulation of its constituents. By selectively removing core PRC1 and PRC2 subunits from neural progenitors, we determined the relative contributions of these chromatin-associated complexes to neuronal diversification. We found that PRC1 represses a broad variety of cell fate determinants, with the majority of highly derepressed genes in <italic>Ring1</italic> mutants encoding transcription factors. Ectopic expression of Ring1-regulated targets is associated with a disruption in chromatin topology, resulting in a gain in accessibility of derepressed genes.</p><p>Despite the derepression of multiple fate determinants in the absence of PRC1 function, markers of MN class identity (e.g. Mnx1, Isl1/2, and Lhx3) are largely unchanged, and MNs do not appear to acquire features of alternate neuronal class fates, beyond expression of fate-defining transcription factors. This observation suggests that once a class identity has been established, ectopic expression of fate determinants is insufficient to respecify basic neuronal features, such as neurotransmitter identity. In <italic>C. elegans</italic> the ability of transcription factors to reprogram neuronal class identity requires removal of histone deacetylase proteins (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib78">Tursun et al., 2011</xref>), suggesting that additional regulatory constraints, such as histone acetylation and/or DNA-methylation, restricts the ability of ectopic transcription factors to interfere with class-specific programs in <italic>Ring1</italic> mutants.</p><p>While basic elements of MN fate are maintained in the absence of PRC1, their differentiation into molecularly distinct subtypes is severely compromised.

Loss of PRC1 does not result in a sustained derepression of all <italic>Hox</italic> genes, as <italic>Hox</italic> genes normally expressed by brachial- and thoracic-level MNs are attenuated in the absence of <italic>Ring1</italic>. These findings are reminiscent of the function of PRCs in <italic>Drosophila</italic>, where loss of PRC function leads to ectopic expression of the caudal <italic>Hox</italic> gene <italic>Abd-b</italic> and repression of <italic>Ubx</italic> expression (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib72">Struhl and Akam, 1985</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib73">Struhl and White, 1985</xref>), likely reflecting cross-repressive interactions between caudal Hox proteins and rostral <italic>Hox</italic> genes. Notably, reduced rostral <italic>Hox</italic> gene expression in <italic>Ring1</italic> mutants is not a reflection of reduced chromatin accessibility at these targets, consistent with a model in which this form of repression is not associated with global changes in chromatin structure.</p><p>In <italic>Ring1</italic> mutants, <italic>Hox13</italic> paralogs are derepressed in MNs, and appear to contribute to the loss of MN subtypes. Derepression of <italic>Hox13</italic> paralogs alone does not appear to account for all of the specification defects in <italic>Ring1</italic> mutants, as <italic>Hox10</italic> paralogs (<italic>Hoxa10</italic>, <italic>Hoxc10</italic>, and <italic>Hoxd10</italic>) were expressed normally in lumbar segments. Hoxc9 can also repress <italic>Hox4-Hox8</italic> paralogs in MNs through direct binding (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib42">Jung et al., 2010</xref>), and likely contributes to the <italic>Ring1</italic> mutant phenotype. Derepression of multiple caudal <italic>Hox</italic> paralogs therefore appears to have a cumulative effect on repressing brachial and thoracic <italic>Hox</italic> genes. In conjunction with studies in <italic>Drosophila</italic>, these finding indicate a conserved mechanism of rostrocaudal patterning, in which PRCs establish rostral <italic>Hox</italic> boundaries, while Hox cross-repressive interactions define caudal boundaries.</p></sec><sec id="s3-3"><title>PRC1 functions in maintaining neuronal subtype fate</title><p>Studies of neuronal and non-neuronal development provide compelling evidence that PRC2 activity is required to restrict gene expression in early development (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Ezhkova et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Gentile et al., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib70">Snitow et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib84">Yaghmaeian Salmani et al., 2018</xref>). Our studies show that <italic>Hox</italic> boundaries are unaffected after genetic removal of PRC2 function, which leads to diminished H3K27me3 by the time of MN differentiation. Mutation of <italic>Ezh</italic> genes or <italic>Eed</italic> depletes H3K27me3 from progenitors and postmitotic neurons by E11.5, without appreciably affecting MN generation, <italic>Hox</italic> expression, or downstream Hox effectors. As the axial identity of progenitor cells appears to be shaped prior to neurogenesis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib54">Metzis et al., 2018</xref>), our PRC2 manipulations likely remove H3K27me3 after Polycomb repression has been initiated. Consistent with this idea, our analyses of <italic>Ezh</italic> mutants as well as previous analyses of Eed<sup>NEΔ</sup> mice (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib84">Yaghmaeian Salmani et al., 2018</xref>), showed detectable levels of H3K27me3 in the MN domain up until E10.5, indicating that some H3K27me3 remains during the phase in which anterior <italic>Hox</italic> boundaries are established.</p><p>How does PRC1 restrict expression of fate determinants in the absence of PRC2 activity? One plausible scenario is that residual H3K27me3 is transmitted through cell division in PRC2 mutants and is sufficient to recruit canonical PRC1 and maintain target gene repression. As cells divide, newly synthesized histones are presumably devoid of H3K27me3 in PRC2 mutants, leading to replication-coupled dilution of H3K27me3. During neural differentiation, the rate of cell division decreases (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib44">Kicheva et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib83">Wilcock et al., 2007</xref>), potentially limiting H3K27me3 depletion, and enabling PRC1 to bind at target loci, even in the absence of de novo H3K27 methylation. Consistent with this idea, recent studies on the effects of PRC2 depletion in intestinal stem cells indicate that ~40% of residual H3K27me3 can maintain PRC repression (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib41">Jadhav et al., 2020</xref>), although the extent of derepression varies with gene target. Although we observed no MN phenotypes in <italic>Ezh</italic> or <italic>Eed</italic> mutants, later-born oligodendrocytes derived from the MN progenitor domain have been shown to depend on PRC2 function for their differentiation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib82">Wang et al., 2020</xref>). This more pronounced effect on glial development likely reflects further dilution of H3K27me3 through cell division in PRC2 mutants.</p><p>Stabilization of PRC1 at repressed loci could also maintain target repression independently of de novo H3K27 methylation. Repression by canonical PRC1 has been shown to depend on the formation of phase-separated subnuclear structures (Polycomb bodies) assembled through polymerization of Polyhomeotic-like (Phc) and/or Cbx proteins (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib40">Isono et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib60">Plys et al., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib77">Tsuboi et al., 2018</xref>). Mutation of <italic>Phc2</italic> in mice leads to ectopic expression of <italic>Hox</italic> genes, with <italic>Hoxb13</italic> among the most robustly derepressed targets (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib40">Isono et al., 2013</xref>). One possibility is that PcG-mediated repression may not exclusively depend on anchoring of PRC1 through H3K27me3, but is also maintained through Phc-mediated chromatin compaction at specific loci. Alternatively, PRC2-independent repression by PRC1 could be facilitated through its H2A-ubiquitination activity, as has been suggested in other systems (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib77">Tsuboi et al., 2018</xref>).</p><p>We suggest that in the early phases of development PRC2 activity defines the sites of maintained H3K27 tri-methylation, initiates PRC1 recruitment, and restricts transcription factor expression in MNs. These activities are likely initiated prior to MN progenitor specification, as recent studies have demonstrated that the establishment of rostrocaudal positional identities can be specified before neural induction (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib54">Metzis et al., 2018</xref>). Patterning morphogens, such as RA and FGF, may act on stem cells to establish the pattern of H3K27me3 at <italic>Hox</italic> loci prior to neurogenesis. This early rostrocaudal patterning step may ultimately serve to coordinate <italic>Hox</italic> expression in the neural tube and surrounding mesodermally-derived tissues. The subsequent switch to reliance on PRC1 function could reflect a general mechanism of gene regulation in neuronal subtypes that become terminally differentiated during development.</p></sec></sec><sec id="s4" sec-type="materials|methods"><title>Materials and methods</title><table-wrap id="keyresource" position="anchor"><label>Key resources table</label><table

Tissue was embedded in OCT, frozen in dry ice, and sectioned at 16 µm on a cryostat. For antibody staining of sections, slides of cryosections were placed in PBS for 5 min to remove OCT. Sections were then transferred to humidified trays and blocked for 20–30 min in 0.75 ml/slide of PBT (PBS, 0.1% Triton) containing 1% Bovine serum albumin (BSA). The blocking solution was replaced with primary staining solution containing antibodies diluted in PBT with 0.1% BSA. Primary antibody staining was performed overnight at 4 °C. Slides were then washed three times for 5 min each in PBT. Fluorophore-conjugated secondary antibodies were diluted 1:500-1:1000 in PBT and filtered through a 0.2 µm syringe filter. Secondary antibody solution was added to slides (0.75 ml/slide) and incubated at room temperature for 1 hr. Slides were washed three times in PBT, followed by a final wash in PBS.

Total RNA was first extracted from eviscerated E12.5 embryos using TRIzol (Invitrogen). Genes of interest were amplified with the One Taq One-Step RT-PCR kit (NEB) using 1 µg of RNA. After amplification by RT-PCR, a second PCR was performed to incorporate a T7 promoter sequence. Antisense riboprobes were generated using the Digoxigenin-dUTP (SP6/T7) labeling kit (Sigma-Aldrich). For in situ hybridization, sections were first dried for 10–15 min at room temperature, placed in 4% PFA, and fixed for 10 min at room temperature. Slides were then washed three times for 3 min each in PBS, and then placed in Proteinase K solution (1 µg/ml) for 5 min at room temperature. After an additional PFA fixation and washing step, slides were treated in triethanolamine for 10 min, to block positive charges in tissue. Slides were then washed three times in PBS and blocked for 2–3 hr in hybridization solution (50% formamide, 5 X SSC, 5 X Denhardt’s solution, 0.2 mg/ml yeast RNA, 0.1 mg/ml salmon sperm DNA). Prehybridization solution was removed, and replaced with 100 µl of hybridization solution containing 100 ng of DIG-labeled antisense probe. Slides were then incubated overnight (12–16 hr) at 72 °C. After hybridization, slides were transferred to a container with 400 ml of 5 X SSC and incubated at 72 °C for 20 min. During this step, coverslips were removed using forceps. Slides were then washed in 400 ml of 0.2 X SSC for 1 hr at 72 °C. Slides were transferred to buffer B1 (0.1 M Tris pH 7.5, 150 mM NaCl) and incubated for 5 min at room temperature. Slides were then transferred to staining trays and blocked in 0.75 ml/slide of B1 containing 10% heat inactivated goat serum. The blocking solution was removed and replaced with antibody solution containing 1% heat inactivated goat serum and a 1:5000 dilution of anti-DIG-AP antibody (Roche). Slides were then incubated overnight at 4 °C in a humidified chamber. The following day, slides were washed three times, 5 min each, with 0.75 ml/slide of buffer B1. Slides were then transferred to buffer B3 (0.1 M Tris pH 9.5, 100 mM NaCl, 50 mM MgCl<sub>2</sub>) and incubated for 5 min.

Fertilized chicken eggs (Charles River) were incubated in a humidified incubator at 39 °C for 40–48 hr until they reached HH13-14. The top of the egg shell was removed and a 1 µg/µl DNA (150–500 ng/µL expression plasmid and pBKS carrier DNA) containing ~0.02% Fast green was injected into the central canal of the neural tube using a sharpened glass capillary tube. Electrodes (Platinum/Iridium (80%/20%), 250 μm diameter, UEPMGBVNXNND, FHC Inc) were placed on both sides of the neural tube (4 mm separation) and DNA was electroporated using an ECM 830 electroporator (ECM 830, BTX; 25 V, 4 pulses, 50ms duration, 1 s interval). Eggs were sealed with parafilm and incubated for 48 hr prior to fixation.

Additional experiments are necessary to better characterize the neurons in Ring1 mutant mice and address the following points: (a) it is unclear whether brachial motor neurons partially switch fate, adopt a mixed identity, and/or convert to a progenitor fate, and (b) the expected expansion of caudal motor neuron fates is not shown or quantified.</p><p>2.

As such, while we begin to understand the diverse mechanisms of PRC-dependent gene regulation, how PRC controls aspects of neuronal development remains largely unknown. In this manuscript, Sawai, Dasen and colleagues propose that PRC1 acts independently of de novo PRC2-dependent histone methylation to control motor neuron subtype specification. They perform a series of elegant genetic experiments in mice in which key PRC1 or PRC2 components are deleted from MN progenitors. The main conclusions of this current study are (1) PRC2 is dispensable for spinal motor neuron specification; (2) PRC1 is essential for the specification of segmentally-restricted motor neuron subtypes; (3) Canonical PRC1 regulates Hox gene expression and represses a variety of cell fate determinants; (4) Selective derepression of caudal Hox genes is associated with increased chromatin accessibility; (5) Hox13 paralogs repress rostral Hox genes by engaging accessible chromatin domains. This latter point is perhaps the most interesting conclusion of this paper as it provides mechanistic insights that, at least partially, explain the observed molecular changes in Ring1 MNDelta mice.</p><p>This is an exciting and very well executed study, which will be of broad interest to the field of neuronal development. Their demonstration of a similar logic in mouse as to what was reported earlier for <italic>Drosophila</italic> PRCs supports the idea of a deeply conserved mechanism of rostrocaudal patterning where PRCs control Hox gene expression. Strengths of this study include (1) the employment of a large collection of conditional mouse mutant lines; (2) the detailed transcriptomics analysis coupled with in vivo ATAC-Seq analysis, (3) the integration of in vitro data from mESC-derived MNs with in vivo experiments in mouse and chick embryos.</p><p>Overall, the conclusions in this paper are well supported and of high quality. One of the authors' main conclusions is that class-specific features of MNs are preserved in Ring1 MNDelta mice. However, the ectopic expression of various cell fate markers begs the question of whether some spinal MNs convert to a MN progenitor fate or adopt a mixed identity. The authors might wish to either further clarify this point, or test these possibilities with additional experiments. Lastly, the authors may want to consider testing Hox13 paralog expression in their PRC2 mutants to strengthen their conclusions.</p><p>The authors observe that class-specific features of MNs are preserved, such as neurotransmitter identity and Hb9 expression. However, strong axon innervation defects and ectopic expression of various cell fate markers are observed in Ring1 MNDelta mice, begging the question of whether some (not all) spinal MNs convert to a MN progenitor fate. Given the precedence in the literature of PRC affecting early patterning events and the observed increase in HMC progenitor cells (Figure 2H), experiments to address this question could strengthen the paper. For example, are markers for the MN progenitor domain (Olig2, Nkx6.1/2, Lhx3, Ngn1/2) expressed in the &quot;presumptive MNs&quot; of Ring1 MNDelta mice? Another intriguing possibility is that some spinal MNs in Ring1 MNDelta mice adopt a &quot;mixed&quot; identity since RNA-Seq analysis revealed ectopic expression of TFs normally involved in interneuron/regional neuronal specification (Figure 3B).</p><p>A previous study by the same lab (Golden and Dasen, G and D, 2012) manipulated the PRC1 component Bmi/Pcgf4 in spinal motor neurons. This study reached similar conclusions (e.g., Bmi1/Pcgf4 is dispensable for generating MNs as a class, Bmi1 controls rostral Hox gene boundaries), but Bmi1 gene manipulation resulted in a switch in MN fates. Given the ectopic expression of a variety of cell fate determinants (incl. numerous transcription factors) in spinal MNs of Ring1 mutant mice (lines 213-222), is there a possibility for a partial cell fate switch? The observed increase in HMC neurons and the presence of thicker axial MN projections support this possibility (Figure 2H), but this is not clearly articulated in the text. Lastly, it could help the reader if the Discussion includes a paragraph that compares the conclusions of the Golden and Dasen, G and D (2012) paper with the conclusions of the present study.</p><p>The authors observe robust derepression of Hox13 genes in all three segmental levels of the Ring1 MNDelta spinal cord. Their mechanistic experiments suggest that Hox13 is one of the main drivers of the observed phenotypes in Ring1 MNDelta mice by repressing expression of rostral Hox genes. It would be valuable to examine Hox13 expression levels in mice lacking PRC2 components to solidify one key conclusion of this study, that is, PRC2 is dispensable for MN specification.</p><p>Lines 58-61, 105-106: The manuscript in Introduction and Discussion is focused on the PRC2-dependent manner (via H3K27me3) by which PRC1 is thought to repress gene expression. However, other mechanisms are possible too. For example, H2A ubiquitination-dependent functions of PRC1 (that are PRC2 independent) have been previously reported to repress gene expression (summarized in this review PMID: 31398486). Discussion of such functions would improve the manuscript.</p><p>Usage of the word &quot;memory&quot; in Title, Abstract and Discussion is confusing. Moreover, the word memory does not adequately describe the key findings of this paper, i.e., retention of motor neuron fate coupled with ectopic expression of various fate determinants. If the authors decide to keep it, they should explain better what exactly &quot;memory&quot; means in their system. Lines 82-83: &quot;These findings indicate that PRC1 can preserve the memory of early patterning events in the CNS&quot;. This sentence is not clear.</p><p>Lines 310-311, 319-321: The authors do a remarkable job to get at mechanism by incorporating RNA-Seq, ATAC-Seq and ChIP-seq data with chick in ovo electroporations. To strengthen their proposed model (line 431), the authors might wish to examine H3K27me3 levels at Hox loci prior to neurogenesis, if available mESC/progenitor datasets already exist.</p><p><italic>Reviewer #2 :</italic></p><p>The Polycomb group of transcriptional regulators is best known for their role in maintaining Hox gene expression during <italic>Drosophila</italic> development. Biochemical analysis from many labs revealed that they are broadly grouped into two types of complexes, called PRC1 and PRC2. The traditional view is that PRC2 acts first, by being recruited to target genes and then depositing a methyl mark on K27 of H3. PRC1 then reads this mark and mediates and maintains transcriptional repression.</p><p>Using genetic methods to remove the activities of core components of both PRC1 and PRC2, the authors show that, at least when the cre drivers (Olig2 and Sox1) they use are active, PRC1, but not PRC2, is essential to maintain segmentally-restricted Hox genes along the rostral-caudal axis of the mouse spinal cord. Consistent with altered Hox gene expression, motor neuron subtype specification is also disrupted in the PRC1 mutant (Ring1). The authors go on to assess motor neuron transcriptomes and chromatin accessibility in the Ring1 depletion background.</p><p>Altogether, the paper provides a very interesting, complete and thorough analysis of the effects of removing PRC1 core component Ring1. The figures and data are well documented, and the conclusions are solid.</p><p>Perhaps the lack of an effect of removing PRC2 components is not as surprising as the authors suggest and could be more clearly and precisely described. For example, given the potential for genetic perdurance of the complex, the exact stage at which PRC2 activity is removed in these experiments isn't clear and could be discussed more thoroughly. It was also unclear whether the analogous manipulations (in terms of the transition form mitotic to post-mitotic cells) have been rigorously carried out in other systems. The loss of H3K27me3 in the motor neuron domain is a good demonstration that these manipulations are working, but again the timing of this loss is not known or discussed.</p><p>In addition to better outlining the timing and potential weaknesses of their PRC2 genetic experiments, I would like to see a better description of why they switched from Olig2:cre to Sox1:cre when testing the role of Ezh and Eed, respectively. Would swapping drivers help make the negative result more convincing? Are there even earlier drivers that could be used?</p><p>I would also like to see a deeper discussion of what the authors think the H3K27me3 modification, which is apparently removed in their PRC2 depletions, might be doing in motor neurons. Have H3K27me3 ChIPs been carried out? Have RNAseq measurements been carried out in this background? What, if any, is the relationship between those sites of histone modification and genes that change expression or positions of chromatin accessibility that do or do not change? Even if more data are not added to this paper, it would be interesting to hear the authors' speculations.</p><p>I'm also moderately puzzled as to why de-repression of caudal Hox genes doesn't typically result in strong repression of more rostral Hox genes. Are they co-expressed in the same cells? Despite the repression observed in the chick electroporation experiments, is cross-repression between Hox genes not occur to a significant degree in this system?</p><p>Is it surprising that the changes in gene expression in the Ring1 mutant are largely the same for all three spinal cord regions (e.g. the heat maps in figure 3)?</p><p><italic>Reviewer (#3):</italic></p><p>This paper is a technical gem. They use Cre lines to knock out core components of PRC1 or PRC2 and assay the effect on HOX gene expression along the rostral/caudal axis of the mouse embryo. In addition to measuring HOX gene expression, they also do scRNA-seq from different regions of the CNS as well as ATAC-seq to assay for open chromatin. The experiments are clean, well controlled, and convincingly presented. On the other hand, I am concerned about the novelty of the study. This is because they primarily assay HOX gene expression, and we know from decades of work that the PRC1/2 complexes repress posterior HOX gene expression to prevent ectopic anterior expression. So that result is beautifully shown, but conceptually already well known. Yet they don't spend enough time characterizing the effect on neurons.

And the published effect on later-born glia suggests that there might indeed be residual Ezh mRNA, protein or H3K27me3 product retained for some time after Cre expression. Of course, proving that a manipulation removes ALL gene product is a difficult task, but needs to be taken more seriously here given the conclusion is in the Title.</p><p>This paper is a technical gem.

Additional experiments are necessary to better characterize the neurons in Ring1 mutant mice and address the following points: (a) it is unclear whether brachial motor neurons partially switch fate, adopt a mixed identity, and/or convert to a progenitor fate, and (b) the expected expansion of caudal motor neuron fates is not shown or quantified.</p></disp-quote><p>(a) In the revision we have clarified what are the ultimate fates of MNs in <italic>Ring1</italic> mutants. We have analyzed markers for MN progenitors (Olig2 and Nkx6.1) in <italic>Ring1</italic> mutants and find they are not ectopically expressed by postmitotic cells. Of note, Nkx6.1 is also expressed by postmitotic limb-level MN pools (De Marco Garcia <italic>Neuron</italic> 2008), and this expression is lost in <italic>Ring1</italic> mutants, consistent with a loss of Hoxdependent MN pool identities. These data are now shown in the revised Figure 1—figure supplement 2A.</p><p>We also find little evidence that MNs adopt a hybrid class identity in <italic>Ring1</italic> mutants. This conclusion is supported by (1) the lack of any reduction in the majority of general MN markers (Mnx1, Isl1, Lhx3, as well neurotransmitter synthesis pathway genes), (2) no marked induction of alternate neurotransmitter fates (i.e. vGlut or vGad induction) as shown in the revised Figure 3—figure supplement 1C. We realize that some of the TFs that are ectopically expressed by MNs in <italic>Ring1</italic> mutants include determinants of ventral spinal interneuron fates (e.g. Chx10 in V2a, Gata2 in V2b, and En1 in V1 interneurons), and therefore one could argue the transcriptional profiles of MNs have shifted away from a “true” MN. Therefore, we have modified the discussion to incorporate this feature as follows:</p><p>“Despite the derepression of multiple fate determinants in the absence of PRC1 function, markers of MN class identity (e.g. Mnx1, Isl1/2, and Lhx3) are largely unchanged, and MNs do not appear to acquire features of alternate neuronal class fates, beyond expression of fate-defining transcription factors.”</p><p>(b) We have also further addressed the question of what are the identities of the remaining MN subtypes in <italic>Ring1</italic> mutants. Although we observe ectopic expression of <italic>Hox13</italic> genes in rostral segments of <italic>Ring1</italic> mutants, we believe our results are most consistent with the remaining brachial and thoracic MNs having the default Hoxindependent “axial” MN fate (i.e. HMC and MMC subtype identities). This is due to MNs having indeterminate Hox codes, due to derepression of multiple caudal <italic>Hox</italic> genes. In the revision we have included new analyses showing that brachial MNs co-express Hoxc9 and Hoxc10 in Figure 1—figure supplement 2B. These neurons also likely co-express <italic>Hox13</italic> genes, although we do not have an antibody to address this. The increase in the numbers of HMC neurons is quantified in Figure 2H.</p><p>Because <italic>Hoxc13</italic> is normally expressed in sacral segments, which consists predominantly of axial MNs that presumably innervate the tail, as well as a small population of PGC-like visceral MNs, it is possible that they express markers of sacral subtypes (through a posterior dominance-like mechanism). However, the absence of ectopic expression of markers for sacral visceral spinal MNs (NOS or Foxp1) argues against MNs acquiring caudal identities. To clarify these issues we have added the following paragraph to the revised discussion.</p><p>“Our results indicate that brachial MNs ectopically express Hox9-Hox13 paralogs in Ring1 mutants, while expression of Hox4-Hox8 genes is diminished. As a consequence, MNs fail to acquire a limb-innervating LMC molecular fate, and express markers indicative of MMC and HMC subtypes. These observations are consistent with a model in which the Hox code of MNs is scrambled in Ring1 mutants, reverting to the fate of ancestral axial subtypes. However, we cannot formally rule out the possibility that some MNs acquire a Hox13<sup>+</sup> fate, although we did not observe expression of markers of sacral PGC identity (nNos, Foxp1).”</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>2.

Unfortunately, all of the commercial Abs that work in IHC against Ezh2 and Ezh1 target the N-terminus, and Ezh2 protein expression is still detected in our conditional mutants. This is in part why we chose to use H3K27me3 staining, as it is a functional readout of PRC2 enzymatic activity, and shows clear depletion from both progenitors and postmitotic neurons by E11.5. One caveat is is that the deletion of either <italic>Ezh</italic> or <italic>Eed</italic> affects only de-novo methylation on newly synthesized histones, therefore the reduction of H3K27me3 is only manifested after several rounds of cell divisions without PRC2 activity. In the revision we include quantification of the reduction of H3K27me3 levels, showing markedly reduced levels in <italic>Ezh</italic> mutants (Figure 1—figure supplement 1A). We also performed an additional analyses to determine the time point in which H3K27me3 levels are reduced, showing detectable H3K27me3 at E10.5 (Figure 1—figure supplement 1B). We performed in situ hybridization against <italic>Hox13</italic> genes (<italic>Hoxc13</italic> and <italic>Hoxb13</italic>) and find no ectopic expression in <italic>Ezh</italic> mutants at E12.5, and show these new results in Figure 5—figure supplement 2.</p><p>We also attempted to perform in situ hybridization with antisense probes against deleted regions in the <italic>Ezh1</italic> and <italic>Ezh2</italic> genes, but were unsuccessful in obtaining clear signals. We believe this is due to the deleted region being relative small (~300), and because the sequence is conserved with other SET domain-containing genes.</p><p>The reported effects of PRC2 on glia (also using <italic>Olig2::Cre</italic>) we believe further support the conclusion that the <italic>Ezh</italic> mutant alleles are effective at depleting function in a replication coupled manner. The differences between MN and glial defects likely reflects that glia are born at later stages of development than MNs, and replicate more times over a longer period, and therefore H3K27me3 is more reduced. In the revision, we have included further discussion about the timing and potential pitfalls of the PRC2 genetic manipulations, and the influence of perdurance of H3K27me3. We revised to discussion as follows:</p><p>“Our studies show that Hox boundaries are maintained after genetic removal of PRC2 function, which leads to diminished H3K27me3 at the time of MN differentiation. Mutation of Ezh genes or Eed depletes H3K27me3 from progenitors and postmitotic neurons by E11.5, without appreciably affecting MN generation, Hox expression, or downstream Hox effectors. As the axial identity of progenitor cells appears to be shaped prior to neurogenesis (Metzis et al., 2018), our PRC2 manipulations likely remove H3K27me3 after Polycomb repression has been initiated. Consistent with this idea, our analyses of Ezh mutant as well as previous analyses of Eed<sup>NE</sup> mice showed detectable levels of H3K27me3 in the MN domain until E10.5, indicating that some H3K27me3 remains during the phase in which anterior Hox boundaries are established (Yaghmaeian Salmani et al., 2018).</p><p>How does PRC1 restrict expression of Hox genes and other fate determinants in the absence of PRC2 function? One plausible scenario is that residual H3K27me3 is transmitted through cell division in PRC2 mutants and is sufficient to recruit canonical PRC1 and maintain target gene repression. As cells divide, newly synthesized histones are presumably devoid of H3K27me3 in PRC2 mutants, leading to replication-coupled dilution of H3K27me3. During neural differentiation, the rate of cell division decreases (Kicheva et al., 2014; Wilcock et al., 2007), potentially limiting H3K27me3 depletion, and enabling PRC1 to bind at target loci, even in the absence of de novo H3K27 methylation. Consistent with this idea, recent studies on the effects of PRC2 depletion in intestinal stem cells indicate that ~40% of residual H3K27me3 can maintain PRC repression (Jadhav et al., 2020), although the extent of derepression varies with gene target.”</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>3. A deeper discussion should be included of what the authors think the H3K27me3 modification, which is apparently removed in their PRC2 depletions, might be doing in motor neurons. Lastly, the authors might wish to examine H3K27me3 levels at Hox loci prior to neurogenesis, if available mESC/progenitor datasets already exist.</p></disp-quote><p>We agree this is an important point which we have provided further clarification and discussion in the revision. We argue that PRC2 is essential in regulating <italic>Hox</italic> expression, but works predominantly at the earliest stages of development, likely prior to neurogenesis. This idea is supported by studies in both ES cells and ES cell-derived MNs, showing removal of PRC2 leads to ectopic <italic>Hox</italic> expression. Analyses of PRC2 function during early neural differentiation has been challenging to study in vivo, as early loss of PRC2 typically has broad impact on cell viability, and the driver we used to target neuroectoderm (<italic>Sox1:Cre</italic>) is the earliest known driver for gene deletion in neural progenitors.</p><p>In the revision we further emphasize the important early role of PRC2 in both the introduction and the discussion. Of note, <italic>Hox</italic> clusters are generally covered by H3K27me3 in ES cells, while the early patterning signals RA and FGF remove these marks from rostral and caudal <italic>Hox</italic> genes, respectively, in MN precursors. We have clarified these findings in the introduction with the following revised paragraph:</p><p>“Polycomb repression is initiated by PRC2, which methylates histone H3 at lysine-27 (H3K27me3), permitting recruitment of PRC1 through subunits that recognize this mark, leading to chromatin compaction at genes targeted for repression (Margueron and Reinberg, 2011; Schuettengruber et al., 2017). In ES cells, Hox gene clusters are initially covered by H3K27me3 and loss of PRC2 function leads to reduced PRC1 binding and ectopic Hox expression (Boyer et al., 2006). During embryonic development, H3K27me3 marks are progressively removed from Hox clusters, allowing for the temporal and spatial activation of more caudal Hox genes during axis extension (Soshnikova and Duboule 2009). The progressive removal of PRC2-associated histone marks is also recapitulated in ES cell-derived MNs (ESC-MNs), where RA functions to deplete H3K27me3 from rostral Hox1-5 genes, while FGF removes H3K27me3 from more caudal Hox genes through Cdx proteins (Mazzoni et al., 2013). Although loss of PRC2 affects the viability of ESC-MNs, a hypomorphic mutation in the PRC2 component Suz12 causes ectopic expression of Hox genes. Thus, during early phases of embryonic development, PRC2 appears to have a critical role in establishing the early profiles of Hox expression along the rostrocaudal axis.”</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Reviewer #1:</p><p>[…]</p><p>The authors observe that class-specific features of MNs are preserved, such as neurotransmitter identity and Hb9 expression. However, strong axon innervation defects and ectopic expression of various cell fate markers are observed in Ring1 MNDelta mice, begging the question of whether some (not all) spinal MNs convert to a MN progenitor fate. Given the precedence in the literature of PRC affecting early patterning events and the observed increase in HMC progenitor cells (Figure 2H), experiments to address this question could strengthen the paper. For example, are markers for the MN progenitor domain (Olig2, Nkx6.1/2, Lhx3, Ngn1/2) expressed in the &quot;presumptive MNs&quot; of Ring1 MNDelta mice?</p></disp-quote><p>In the revised paper, we have analyzed expression of Olig2 and Nkx6.1 finding no ectopic expression in the presumptive MNs of <italic>Ring1</italic> mutants.

Lhx3 is normally expressed by MMC neurons, and this pattern is largely unchanged, with the exception of a small reduction at brachial levels, and the presence of a population of MNs that co-express Lhx3, Isl1, and Mnx1 (Hb9), as shown and quantified in Figure 2.

In the Golden paper, <italic>Bmi1</italic> is acutely deleted from MNs in chick after axial identity has been established, whereas in <italic>Ring1</italic> mutants, the gene is removed at the time Olig2 is activated. We have added the following paragraph to clarify these differences (the most relevant being the differences in Bmi1 loss mediated through dsRNA electroporation near the time of MN differentiation versus genetic excision from Olig2+ progenitors in the Ring1 mutant).</p><p>“We previously found that acute depletion of the canonical PRC1 component Bmi1 in chick leads to ectopic Hoxc9 expression in brachial segments and a switch of LMC neurons to a thoracic PGC fate (Golden and Dasen 2012). By contrast in Ring1 mutants, multiple caudal Hox genes (Hox9-Hox13) are derepressed, and the remaining MNs have an axial subtype fate. While the exact mechanisms of these difference are unclear, they could reflect differences in the timing and spatial extent of the manipulations. In Ring1 mutants PRC1 function is depleted from MN progenitors throughout the rostrocaudal axis, whereas Bmi1 knockdown was performed in brachial segments just prior to differentiation.”</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>The authors observe robust derepression of Hox13 genes in all three segmental levels of the Ring1 MNDelta spinal cord. Their mechanistic experiments suggest that Hox13 is one of the main drivers of the observed phenotypes in Ring1 MNDelta mice by repressing expression of rostral Hox genes. It would be valuable to examine Hox13 expression levels in mice lacking PRC2 components to solidify one key conclusion of this study, that is, PRC2 is dispensable for MN specification.</p></disp-quote><p>We thank the reviewer for this excellent suggesting and have now performed an analysis of <italic>Hox13</italic> (<italic>Hoxc13</italic> and <italic>Hoxb13</italic>) gene expression in <italic>Ezh dKO</italic> mice.

However, other mechanisms are possible too. For example, H2A ubiquitination-dependent functions of PRC1 (that are PRC2 independent) have been previously reported to repress gene expression (summarized in this review PMID: 31398486). Discussion of such functions would improve the manuscript.</p></disp-quote><p>We thank the reviewer for this suggestion. The role of PRC1-mediated H2A ubiquitination in the repression <italic>Hox</italic> genes is somewhat controversial, as studies in both mouse and fly have shown this enzymatic function is not required for repression/compaction of <italic>Hox</italic> genes in early development (PMID: 26178786, 26385961). Nevertheless, we have revised discussion to raise the possibility that this function may contribute to PRC2independent functions of PRC1 in MNs as follows:</p><p>“Stabilization of PRC1 at repressed loci could also maintain target repression independently of de novo H3K27 methylation. Repression by canonical PRC1 has been shown to depend on the formation of phase-separated subnuclear structures (Polycomb bodies) assembled through polymerization of Polyhomeotic-like (Phc) and/or Cbx proteins (Isono et al., 2013; Plys et al., 2019; Tsuboi et al., 2018). Mutation of Phc2 in mice leads to ectopic expression of Hox genes, with Hox13 genes among the most robustly derepressed targets (Isono et al., 2013). One possibility is that PcG-mediated repression may not exclusively depend on anchoring of PRC1 through H3K27me3, but is also maintained through Phc-mediated chromatin compaction at specific loci. Alternatively, PRC2-independent repression by PRC1 could be facilitated through its H2A-ubiquitination activity, as has been suggested in other systems (Tsuboi et al., 2019).”</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Usage of the word &quot;memory&quot; in Title, Abstract and Discussion is confusing.

Biochemical analysis from many labs revealed that they are broadly grouped into two types of complexes, called PRC1 and PRC2. The traditional view is that PRC2 acts first, by being recruited to target genes and then depositing a methyl mark on K27 of H3. PRC1 then reads this mark and mediates and maintains transcriptional repression.</p><p>Using genetic methods to remove the activities of core components of both PRC1 and PRC2, the authors show that, at least when the cre drivers (Olig2 and Sox1) they use are active, PRC1, but not PRC2, is essential to maintain segmentally-restricted Hox genes along the rostral-caudal axis of the mouse spinal cord. Consistent with altered Hox gene expression, motor neuron subtype specification is also disrupted in the PRC1 mutant (Ring1). The authors go on to assess motor neuron transcriptomes and chromatin accessibility in the Ring1 depletion background.</p><p>Altogether, the paper provides a very interesting, complete and thorough analysis of the effects of removing PRC1 core component Ring1. The figures and data are well documented, and the conclusions are solid.</p><p>Perhaps the lack of an effect of removing PRC2 components is not as surprising as the authors suggest and could be more clearly and precisely described. For example, given the potential for genetic perdurance of the complex, the exact stage at which PRC2 activity is removed in these experiments isn't clear and could be discussed more thoroughly.</p></disp-quote><p>We thank the reviewer for this suggestion and have revised both the results and discussion accordingly. We have removed statements describing this finding as unexpected or surprising in the revision. Previous characterization of <italic>Sox10:Cre;Eed</italic> mice indicated that H3K27me3 is undetectable in the neural tube by E11.5, while it is still detectable at ~E10. We have also performed an additional analysis of <italic>Ezh</italic> mutant embryos, showing detectable H3K27me3 at E10.5. We have revised introduction and discussion to clarify 1) the evidence that PRC2 does play important roles at early stages (work mostly done in ES cells and ES cell-derived MNs and (2) that the absence of a <italic>Hox</italic> phenotype could be due to perdurance of this histone mark during MN differentiation (discussion).

Are there even earlier drivers that could be used?</p></disp-quote><p>We have clarified why we switched to <italic>Sox1::Cre</italic> in the revision. <italic>Sox1</italic> is the earliest expressed gene that we are aware of that specifically targets neuroectoderm, which was the original motivation for switching to this driver. We have added the following to the Results section to clarify:</p><p>“Removal of Ezh genes via Olig2<sup>Cre</sup> depletes PRC2 function in MN progenitors, raising the possibility that PRC2 regulates Hox expression at earlier stages. We therefore analyzed mice in which the core PRC2 component Eed was deleted using Sox1<sup>Cre</sup> (Eed<sup>NEΔ</sup> mice), which targets Cre to neuroectoderm (Takashima et al., 2007; Yaghmaeian Salmani et al., 2018). In Eed<sup>NEΔ</sup> mice, H3K27me3 was depleted from spinal progenitors and postmitotic neurons by E11.5, with some H3K27me3 present in the floor plate (Figure 1—figure supplement 1G). In Eed<sup>NEΔ</sup> mice, the number of Mnx1<sup>+</sup> cells, and pattern of Hoxc6, Hoxc9, and Hoxc10 in MNs were unaffected, similar to Ezh<sup>MNΔ</sup> mice (Figure 1—figure supplement 1F,H-J). These observations indicate that depletion of PRC2 function does not affect MN class specification or rostrocaudal positional identities at the time of differentiation.”</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>I would also like to see a deeper discussion of what the authors think the H3K27me3 modification, which is apparently removed in their PRC2 depletions, might be doing in motor neurons. Have H3K27me3 ChIPs been carried out? Have RNAseq measurements been carried out in this background? What, if any, is the relationship between those sites of histone modification and genes that change expression or positions of chromatin accessibility that do or do not change? Even if more data are not added to this paper, it would be interesting to hear the authors’ speculations.</p></disp-quote><p>Previous studies using ChIP-seq to measure H3K27me3 at <italic>Hox</italic> loci have shown H3K27me3 marks are removed progressively from <italic>Hox</italic> clusters along the rostrocaudal axis during axis extension in mouse embryos, and loss of these marks is associated with <italic>Hox</italic> gene activation (Soshnikova and Duboule 2009). A similar progression in H3K27me3 removal is observed in ES-derived MNs treated with the patterning cues RA and FGF (Mazzoni et al., 2013). PRC2 mutants typically perish at preimplantation stages, which has limited studies of changes in gene expression during neural development in vivo. Nevertheless, RNAseq has been performed on brain regions of <italic>Eed<sup>NEΔ</sup></italic> mutants (Yaghmaeian Salmani et al., 2018), showing derepression of <italic>Hox</italic> genes in the brain. We suspect that the differences between the brain and spinal cord may related to differences in the proliferation, as the brain generates a larger number of neurons, and where any residual H3K27me3 may be further diluted. We do believe PRC2/H3K27me3 is important at early stages of development, and the lack of <italic>Hox</italic> changes in PRC2 mutants could be due to perdurance of the histone mark. We have modified the discussion to incorporate these ideas. See Essential revision 2 and Essential revision 3 for specific changes in the revision.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>I’m also moderately puzzled as to why de-repression of caudal Hox genes doesn’t typically result in strong repression of more rostral Hox genes.</p></disp-quote><p>There is some disconnection between what we observe with Hox Ab staining/in situ and the level of repression as measured by RNAseq. With Ab staining, expression of the brachial Hox proteins is diminished to undetectable levels in <italic>Ring1</italic> mutants. The in situ we performed for <italic>Hoxc6</italic> shows similar pronounced reduction in <italic>Hox</italic> expression, while the reduction measured by RNAseq DESeq2 counts is ~50%. The less pronounced reduction in the RNAseq results could be due contamination in the sorted neurons, which may include some interneurons. This possibility was a motivating factor in confirming both derepressed and repressed genes by in situ hybridization.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Are they co-expressed in the same cells? Despite the repression observed in the chick electroporation experiments, is cross-repression between Hox genes not occur to a significant degree in this system?</p></disp-quote><p>Yes, we do observe co-expression of Hoxc9 and Hoxc10 protein in brachial segments, although the absolute levels of both are lower than what we observe in their normal domains (thoracic and lumbar, respectively). Presumably, this reduction in Hoxc9 and Hoxc10 expression is due to repression by Hox13 proteins, via cross repression. Nevertheless, these results are consistent with the idea that in <italic>Ring1</italic> mutants the Hox code is scrambled. We have added this data to Figure 1—figure supplement 2B.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Is it surprising that the changes in gene expression in the Ring1 mutant are largely the same for all three spinal cord regions (e.g. the heat maps in figure 3)?</p></disp-quote><p>Yes, the changes in gene expression are similar in each region for derepressed genes. We think that given that majority of the derepressed genes encode transcription factors, most of which are not normally expressed by MNs, this result is not surprising. The DESeq2 counts shown for select genes in Figure 4 also show similar degrees of derepression in each segment. This result contrasts with some of the <italic>Hox</italic> genes which normally have restricted expressed in MNs, where we do observe some segment-specific expression changes (for example Hoxc10 is derepressed in brachial and thoracic segments, but not lumbar).</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Reviewer #3:</p><p>This paper is a technical gem. They use Cre lines to knock out core components of PRC1 or PRC2 and assay the effect on HOX gene expression along the rostral/caudal axis of the mouse embryo. In addition to measuring HOX gene expression, they also do scRNA-seq from different regions of the CNS as well as ATAC-seq to assay for open chromatin. The experiments are clean, well controlled, and convincingly presented.</p><p>On the other hand, I am not convinced it should be published in eLife. This is because they primarily assay HOX gene expression, and we know from decades of work that the PRC1/2 complexes repress posterior HOX gene expression to prevent ectopic anterior expression. So that result is beautifully shown, but conceptually already well known.</p></disp-quote><p>We agree that the important roles of PRCs in regulating <italic>Hox</italic> expression are known from both classic studies in flies and worms, as well as many studies in mammalian systems (largely in vitro). We do believe though that the differences between PRC1 and PRC2 function have not been directly compared in an in vivo model, and their specific functions in vertebrate neuronal diversification and chromatin organization are poorly defined. We also think it is surprising there does not appear to be a large-scale derepression of gene expression in PRC1 mutants, and that class-specific features MNs are maintained. Also, as there has been much attention to variant PRC1 in recent years, we believe our analyses of Rybp mutants will be broadly interesting to those that work on PRCs in other developmental contexts.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Second, they don’t spend enough time characterizing the effect on neurons. They show that in the absence of PRC1 there is a loss of rostral neuron numbers, but they don’t assay for ectopic caudal neurons, or the effect of this neuronal fate switch on the function of the MNs.</p></disp-quote><p>In the revision we have clarified what are the ultimate fates of MNs in the absence of PRC1/Ring1 function. Our results indicate that MNs do not transform to a caudal fate, but are retained in the more ancestral “Hox-less” axial columnar identity, likely due to MNs having an ambiguous Hox code. See specific changes to the revised text and figures to clarify this point are detailed in Essential revision 1.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Third, they don’t prove that PRC2 is not relevant, as indicated in the title/abstract. They don’t assay for loss of Ezh protein in the ezh knockout, and their proxy H3K27me3 could be functional even at low levels. (Note the level of Ezh or H3K27me3 was not quantified anywhere I could find.) And the published effect on later-born glia suggests that there might indeed be residual Ezh mRNA, protein or H3K27me3 product retained for some time after Cre expression. Of course, proving that a manipulation removes ALL gene product is a difficult task, but needs to be taken more seriously here given the conclusion is in the Title.</p></disp-quote><p>We agree that even if PRC2 gene function is effectively depleted there is still the possibility of remaining H3K27me3, by virtue of inheritance from cells that had this modification prior to deletion. We have revised the paper and our interpretation of these results as detailed in Essential revision 1.</p><p>We appreciate the concerns of the reviewer about the title of the paper. It was not our intention to convey that PRC2 is not important, but rather that the enzymatic activity is not needed at the time of differentiation. We have revised the title to be more specific that we are referring to the function of the PRC2 encoding genes, not specifically about H3K27me3.</p><p>We have also clarified in the discussion that we are not arguing that PRC2 is never important for Hox gene regulation, but that it is likely operating to set the profile of PRC1 recruitment at Hox loci prior to neurogenesis, as suggested by Metzis et al. 2018.
