since its isolation from the wild. We show that the causal, laboratory-derived mutations in two genes, npr-1 and glb-5, confer large fitness advantages in standard laboratory conditions. Using environmental manipulations that suppress social/solitary behavior differences, we show the fitness advantages of the derived alleles remained unchanged, suggesting selection on these alleles acted through pleiotropic traits. Transcriptomics, developmental timing, and food consumption assays showed that N2 animals mature faster, produce more sperm, and consume more food than a strain containing ancestral alleles of these genes regardless of behavioral strategies. Our data suggest that the pleiotropic effects of glb-5 and npr-1 are a consequence of changes to O<sub>2</sub> -sensing neurons that regulate both aerotaxis and energy homeostasis. Our results demonstrate how pleiotropy can lead to profound behavioral changes in a popular laboratory model.</p></abstract><abstract abstract-type="executive-summary"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.38675.002</object-id><title>eLife digest</title><p>Why do humans walk on two feet? And what makes us smarter than our ape ancestors? The answers to these questions, and countless others about the particular traits of any number of species, is often said to be natural selection – a process where genes that ensure the survival of a species are favored of others. But it is not always the answer. Other evolutionary forces, such as random changes to the frequency of certain gene variants, restrictions on the development of a certain trait and pleiotropy (where one gene influences other, seemingly unrelated traits) can also cause differences between species.</p><p>Designing experiments to test whether a trait difference is due to natural selection or other factors is notoriously difficult. However, the humble nematode worm, <italic>Caenorhabditis elegans</italic>, has proven to be particularly useful in this respect. One subtype or strain of <italic>C. elegans</italic> with certain changes to its genes is used internationally as a ‘reference strain’, to ensure results between labs are comparable. This strain, N2, has been bred in the laboratory for hundreds of generations, isolated from its wild counterparts. N2 shows several differences in behavior from the wildtype, including its feeding habits. Wild <italic>C. elegans</italic> tend to feed together socially, whereas N2 prefers to feed alone.</p><p>In 1998 and 2009, researchers – including some involved in the current study – have identified the genetic modifications responsible for this change in behavior. Now, Zhao et al. set out to determine whether this was due to natural selection, and if so, was there a benefit to solitary feeding in laboratory conditions that was driving this genetic change? Zhao et al. found that the genetic changes in the N2 strain gave the worms a considerable advantage in the artificial environment. However, experiments to modify the conditions the animals grew in revealed that the solitary feeding habits were not necessary for the fitness advantage. In other words, the changes in feeding habits were a symptom of the genetic changes that gave N2 a selective advantage, but they were not the cause. In other words, the changes in feeding behavior were not a result of natural selection, but rather of pleiotropy.</p><p>The findings highlight that not every change in a trait is down to natural selection and must therefore be put to the test. With declining costs of DNA sequencing, researchers can now easily identify genes and regions of DNA that are likely to be under selection. However, they must be careful before leaping to the conclusion that behavioral differences linked to genetic changes are adaptive. In addition, the findings show that the laboratories relying on N2 as a model organism should be aware that the strain has evolved fundamental differences in its brain connections compared with the wildtype.</p></abstract><kwd-group kwd-group-type="author-keywords"><kwd>laboratory adaptation</kwd><kwd>feeding</kwd><kwd>social behavior</kwd><kwd>pleiotropy</kwd><kwd>oxygen sensation</kwd><kwd>pheromones</kwd></kwd-group><kwd-group kwd-group-type="research-organism"><title>Research organism</title><kwd><italic>C. elegans</italic></kwd></kwd-group><funding-group><award-group id="fund1"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000057</institution-id><institution>National Institute of General Medical Sciences</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>R01GM114170</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Zhao</surname><given-names>Yuehui</given-names></name><name><surname>Long</surname><given-names>Lijiang</given-names></name><name><surname>Xu</surname><given-names>Wen</given-names></name><name><surname>Campbell</surname><given-names>Richard F</given-names></name><name><surname>Large</surname><given-names>Edward E</given-names></name><name><surname>McGrath</surname><given-names>Patrick T</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund2"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000049</institution-id><institution>National Institute on Aging</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>R21AG050304</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>McGrath</surname><given-names>Patrick T</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund3"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000863</institution-id><institution>Ellison Medical Foundation</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>New Scholars in Aging</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Long</surname><given-names>Lijiang</given-names></name><name><surname>Xu</surname><given-names>Wen</given-names></name><name><surname>McGrath</surname><given-names>Patrick T</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><funding-statement>The funders had no role in study design, data collection and interpretation, or the decision to submit the work for publication.</funding-statement></funding-group><custom-meta-group><custom-meta specific-use="meta-only"><meta-name>Author impact statement</meta-name><meta-value>Use of experimental manipulation demonstrates that social/solitary feeding behaviors are unrelated to the fitness gains conferred by causative alleles in two previously identified genes.</meta-value></custom-meta></custom-meta-group></article-meta></front><body><sec id="s1" sec-type="intro"><title>Introduction</title><p>It is tempting to compare the endless forms of life and create adaptive hypotheses to explain their differences. Why are polar bears white? Perhaps as camouflage for when they hunt. Or perhaps to make it easier to absorb heat from the sun. Both explanations make sense, but designing experiments to distinguish between these possibilities is not trivial. Further, as Gould and Lewontin critiqued, relying on adaptive evolution as the sole explanation for phenotypic change while ignoring alternative explanations such as genetic drift, adaptive constraints, or pleiotropy does not follow Darwin’s pluralistic approach (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Gould and Lewontin, 1979</xref>). In the current era, inexpensive next-generation sequencing and increasingly sophisticated bioinformatics analysis enable the identification of causative mutations with signatures of selection, yet it is difficult to determine <italic>why</italic> these alleles are under selection. Indeed, the pervasive effects of pleiotropy means that signatures of selection alone are not enough, adaptive hypotheses must be tested directly. Experimental evolution offers a route to test hypothesis directly (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Fisher and Lang, 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib49">Lenski, 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib69">Teotónio et al., 2017</xref>). The ability to manipulate model organisms in the lab provides a greater opportunity to test adaptive hypotheses beyond arguments of plausibility and address the role of these other competing themes in the evolution of biological traits.</p><p>These studies are also useful for understanding how organisms adapt to laboratory conditions. Since the fundamental work of Gregor Mendel elucidating the laws of genetic transmission, model organisms have enabled experimenters to gain fundamental insights into many biological processes. Modern research tools are facilitating the use of new and unusual species to analyze longstanding biological questions (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Alfred and Baldwin, 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Gladfelter, 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Goldstein and King, 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib64">Russell et al., 2017</xref>). More and more species are reared in the laboratory as models for biological traits of interest. An issue for these approaches, particularly for comparative analysis or for those addressing evolutionary questions, is the extreme shift in environment and associated selective pressures that these populations experience. All species evolve through the process of natural selection and genetic drift; many model organisms have evolved by exposure to the novel and artificial conditions experienced in the lab (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib60">Orozco-terWengel et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Duveau and Félix, 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">Goto et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib44">Kasahara et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib54">Marks et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib65">Stanley and Kulathinal, 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib74">Yvert et al., 2003</xref>). Understanding the process of adaptation of wild populations to captivity is necessary to understand how the genetic, developmental, and neural circuits are changed in these laboratory populations.</p><p>As a model for understanding laboratory adaptation in a multicellular organism, we have focused our studies on the N2 strain of <italic>Caenorhabditis elegans</italic>. N2 is the canonical reference strain used by hundreds of <italic>C. elegans</italic> labs across the world. While this strain was introduced to the genetics research community by Sydney Brenner in 1974 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Brenner, 1974</xref>), it was actually isolated by L.N. Staniland and Warwick Nicholas from mushroom compost in 1951, spending multiple decades (~300–2000 generations) in two primary growth conditions: on agar plates where bacteria was its primary food source or in liquid axenic media (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib66">Sterken et al., 2015</xref>). A small number (~100) of new mutations that arose and fixed in the N2 strain following isolation from the wild have been identified (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib57">McGrath et al., 2011</xref>), including a neomorphic, missense mutation in the neuropeptide receptor gene <italic>npr-1</italic> and a recessive, 765 bp duplication in the nematode-specific globin gene <italic>glb-5</italic>. These mutations were originally identified for their role in foraging and aerotaxis behaviors and were initially thought to represent natural genetic variants (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">de Bono and Bargmann, 1998</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib62">Persson et al., 2009</xref>) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1a</xref>). A large body of work has found that these genes regulate the activity of the URX-RMG neuronal circuit that controls O<sub>2</sub> responses on food (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Chang et al., 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Coates and de Bono, 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">Gray et al., 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib53">Macosko et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib56">McGrath et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib62">Persson et al., 2009</xref>).

However, aggregation behavior in the ancestral <italic>npr-1</italic> strain appears to create local food depletion leading to a weak starvation state, which reduces reproduction and growth (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Andersen et al., 2014</xref>). Potentially, this starvation difference could be responsible for the fitness differences of the strains. Consistent with both hypotheses, a number of experimental crosses or competition experiments between parental strains that are polymorphic for <italic>npr-1</italic> have resulted in enrichment of the derived allele of <italic>npr-1</italic>, suggesting it confers a fitness advantage under standard lab husbandry (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Gloria-Soria and Azevedo, 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib58">Noble et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib71">Weber et al., 2010</xref>).</p><p>In order to distinguish between these hypotheses, we performed pairwise competition experiments following a number of environmental and/or genetic manipulations. Surprisingly, our results suggest that neither hypothesis is correct. While the derived <italic>npr-1</italic> and <italic>glb-5</italic> alleles increase fitness of animals on agar plates, the differences in social vs. solitary behavior are not necessary for their differences in fitness. Instead, our work suggests that fitness gains are due to increases in food consumption and changes in reproductive timing, mediated by O<sub>2</sub>-sensing body cavity neurons that are also required for social feeding behaviors. Our work demonstrates that even when alleles are identified that confer fitness advantages, care must be taken in inferring the phenotypes that are responsible due to the pleiotropic actions of genetic changes.</p></sec><sec id="s2" sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><sec id="s2-1"><title>Derived alleles of <italic>npr-1</italic> and <italic>glb-5</italic> increase fitness in laboratory conditions</title><p>In previous reports, we have used multigenerational pairwise competition experiments to compare the relative fitness of two strains (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1b</xref>) utilizing Droplet Digital PCR with a custom TaqMan probe to quantify the proportion of each genotype (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Evans et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">Greene et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib45">Large et al., 2016</xref>). To quantify this change, we used a generic selection model to estimate the relative fitness difference (w) between the two strains (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1c</xref>). In this context, relative fitness measures the generational change in relative abundance of each of the two strains. We also used CRISPR-enabled genome engineering to create strains with a silent mutation in the <italic>dpy-10</italic> gene using a previously published high-efficiency guide RNA (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1d</xref>) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Arribere et al., 2014</xref>), which we will refer to as barcoded strains. These strains allow us to use a common Taqman probe to quantify the relative fitness of a test strain against these barcoded strains. We confirmed that the <italic>dpy-10</italic> silent mutation had no statistically significant effect on fitness in two genetic backgrounds studied throughout this report (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1e</xref>).</p><p>In order to test the fitness effect of the derived alleles of <italic>npr-1</italic> and <italic>glb-5</italic>, we utilized three previously described near isogenic lines (NILs) containing ancestral alleles of <italic>npr-1</italic> (QG1), <italic>glb-5</italic> (CX10774), or both genes (CX12311) introgressed from the Hawaiian CB4856 wild strain into the standard N2 background (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Bernstein and Rockman, 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib56">McGrath et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib57">McGrath et al., 2011</xref>). The <italic>npr-1</italic> introgressed region is ~110 kb in size and the <italic>glb-5</italic> introgressed region is ~290 kb in size. For brevity, we will refer to genotype of these introgressed regions throughout this report by the ancestral/derived allele they contain (e.g. the ancestral allele of <italic>npr-1</italic> vs the introgressed region containing the ancestral allele of <italic>npr-1</italic>). For clarity, we will refer to the NILs colloquially using the ancestral introgression(s) they contain instead of their opaque strain names (i.e. N2 = N2, CX10774 = N2<italic><sub>glb-5</sub></italic>, QG1 = N2<italic><sub>npr-1</sub></italic>, and CX12311 = N2<italic><sub>glb-5, npr-1</sub></italic>). If needed, readers can find the strain name used in each figure in the supplemental source data files. In contrast to the N2 strain, the N2<italic><sub>glb-5, npr-1</sub></italic> strain aggregates at the border of bacterial lawns where O<sub>2</sub> levels are lowest due to the increased height of the bacterial lawn. We confirmed previous reports that both the derived alleles of <italic>npr-1</italic> and <italic>glb-5</italic> suppress bordering behavior to varying degrees (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Bendesky et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">de Bono and Bargmann, 1998</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib56">McGrath et al., 2009</xref>); <italic>npr-1</italic> accounted for the majority of the difference with <italic>glb-5</italic> playing a modulatory role (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2a</xref>). To compare the relative fitness of the four strains, we competed each strain against the barcoded N2<italic><sub>glb-5, npr-1</sub></italic> strain, transferring animals each generation by washing to minimize potential sources of investigator bias toward picking social or solitary animals (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2b</xref>). The N2 strain was the most fit in these conditions, with a relative fitness (w) of ~1.30. Interestingly, the fitness effects of the <italic>glb-5</italic> and <italic>npr-1</italic> regions were epistatic - the derived allele of <italic>glb-5</italic> increased the relative fitness in the derived <italic>npr-1</italic> background but showed no effect in the ancestral allele of <italic>npr-1</italic>.

To confirm the fitness advantage of the derived <italic>glb-5</italic> allele in the derived <italic>npr-1</italic> background, we also competed the N2<italic><sub>glb-5</sub></italic> strain against the barcoded N2 strain (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2b</xref>). The estimated selective coefficient (a common measure of the fitness difference of a beneficial allele) of the <italic>glb-5</italic> allele in the <italic>npr-1</italic> derived background was s = 0.10 (0.06–0.13 95% confidence interval), the estimated selective coefficient of the <italic>npr-1</italic> allele in the <italic>glb-5</italic> ancestral background was s = 0.17 (0.12–0.23 95% confidence interval), and the estimated selective coefficient of the <italic>npr-1</italic> allele in the <italic>glb-5</italic> derived background was s = 0.30 (0.27–0.34 95% confidence interval). These selective coefficients are comparable to beneficial alleles identified in other organisms, such as the haplotype responsible for lactase persistence (~0.01–0.19) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Bersaglieri et al., 2004</xref>) and the sickle-cell trait (0.05–0.18) in humans (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib50">Li, 1975</xref>).</p><fig id="fig2" position="float"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.38675.006</object-id><label>Figure 2.</label><caption><title>Derived alleles of <italic>npr-1</italic> and <italic>glb-5</italic> are beneficial.</title><p>(<bold>a</bold>) The bordering rate of the N2 reference strain compared to three near isogenic lines (NILs) containing ancestral alleles of <italic>npr-1</italic> and/or <italic>glb-5</italic> introgressed from the CB4856 wild strain.

To further gain insight into this connection, we plotted the average transcriptional change between the strain backgrounds vs the average transcriptional change between the environmental O<sub>2</sub> concentrations for each gene (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5c</xref>, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="supp1">Supplementary file 1</xref>). Surprisingly, we observed a bimodal distribution of values, with a cluster of 652 genes centered at 1.2 log<sub>2</sub>-fold change (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5c</xref> – red circle). This is unexpected, as it suggests that the environmental and genetic perturbations had identical effects on transcription for all these genes. When we inspected this list of genes, we noticed a large number of genes that are known to be involved in spermatogenesis. We further investigated the developmental regulation of these 652 genes using previously published transcriptomics data isolated from hermaphrodites or males at specific developmental time points (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Boeck et al., 2016</xref>) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5d</xref>). The expression of the majority of these genes peaked during the L4 stage in hermaphrodites, was further enriched in L4 males, and suppressed in somatic cells isolated from L4 animals. These observations are consistent with this cluster of genes being involved in spermatogenesis, which occurs during the L4 stage (when RNA was isolated) in hermaphrodite animals.</p><p>We reasoned that the transcriptomics data could indicate a difference in the relative timing of spermatogenesis and/or the number of sperm that are produced in each genetic background/environmental condition. L1 larval stage animals were synchronized; subsequent differences in developmental speed would result in animals in slightly different stages of L4. To test this, we synchronized N2<italic><sub>glb-5, npr-1</sub></italic> and N2 animals, placed them in 10% or 21% environmental O<sub>2</sub>, and identified the number animals containing mature sperm at 2 hr intervals from 48 to 56 hr. N2 animals began spermatogenesis approximately 2 hr earlier than the N2<italic><sub>glb-5, npr-1</sub></italic> animals, regardless of the environmental O<sub>2</sub> levels (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5e</xref>). Hermaphrodites undergo spermatogenesis for a fixed period of time before permanently switching gametogenesis to the production of oocytes, resulting in the development of a fixed number of self-sperm that are stored in the spermathecae (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">Hubbard and Greenstein, 2005</xref>). To test whether these strains produced the same number of sperm, we used DAPI staining to count the number of sperm found in the spermathecae. Not only did N2 animals start spermatogenesis earlier, they also produced more sperm (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5f</xref>). The total fecundity of N2 hermaphrodites that do not mate with males is determined by the number of self-sperm. We confirmed that the difference in self-sperm number also resulted in a larger overall brood size (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5g</xref>) and as expected from computational modeling (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib46">Large et al., 2017</xref>), an increased rate of egg-laying later on in life (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5h</xref>).</p><p>The timing of sexual maturity is an important factor in determining the fitness of animals. We also tested whether the differences in timing of spermatogenesis could lead to differences in when fertilized eggs are produced. We performed similar experiments as above and monitored the time fertilized eggs could be observed in the uterus at two-hour intervals. Again, we observed a difference in N2 and N2<italic><sub>glb-5, npr-1</sub></italic> animals at both 10% and 21% environmental O<sub>2</sub> levels. N2 animals were observed to contain fertilized eggs approximately 1 hr earlier that N2<italic><sub>glb-5, npr-1</sub></italic> animals (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5i</xref>). The difference in timing of spermatogenesis and fertilization (2 hr vs 1 hr), potentially reflects the fact that N2 animals produce more sperm before switching to oogenesis.</p><p>These experiments suggest that the differences in transcription between N2 and N2<italic><sub>glb-5, npr-1</sub></italic> could be caused by differences in sexual maturity. We are unable, however, to explain the differences in transcription we observed between 10% and 21% O<sub>2</sub> as mature sperm was observed at similar times in these different environmental conditions (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5e</xref>). Potentially, the rate of spermatogenesis or expression levels of genes are modified by O<sub>2</sub> levels that are not reflected in the timing of the presence of mature sperm.</p></sec><sec id="s2-4"><title>Derived alleles of <italic>npr-1</italic> and/or <italic>glb-5</italic> increase food consumption in an O<sub>2</sub>-independent manner</title><p>Life-history tradeoffs have been proposed in evolutionary theory to account for the linkage between two different traits. Assuming an individual can acquire a finite amount of energy, the investment of energy into one trait leads to consequential changes in other traits as energy resources are shunted into different directions. For example, artificial selection experiments on early fecundity in <italic>C. elegans</italic> resulted in decreased reproduction late in life (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Anderson et al., 2011</xref>). The N2 strain seems to violate this tradeoff, as it sexually matures earlier than N2<italic><sub>glb-5, npr-1</sub></italic>, but also produces more eggs later on in life. We measured the size of N2 and N2<italic><sub>glb-5, npr-1</sub></italic> animals and found that N2 animals were also larger than N2<italic><sub>glb-5, npr-1</sub></italic> animals at synchronized time points (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6a</xref>).

In this assay, individual wells are seeded with a defined number of bacteria and 20 worms. Each day, the optical density of each well is measured to estimate the amount of food consumed by the worms. In these conditions, N2 cleared the bacteria faster than N2<italic><sub>glb-5, npr-1</sub></italic> animals (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6b</xref>). While these assays supported our hypothesis, liquid media is fundamentally different from the conditions experienced on agar plates, making it difficult to generalize the results from one condition to the other. To this end, we developed a new food consumption assay on agar media in 24-well plates. In this assay, each well was seeded with a defined amount of OP50-GFP, which we found could be quantified in a linear manner using a plate reader (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6c</xref>). When we tested N2 and N2<italic><sub>glb-5, npr-1</sub></italic> animals in 10% or 21% environmental O<sub>2</sub> levels, we found N2 consumed more food than N2<italic><sub>glb-5, npr-1</sub></italic> in both environmental conditions (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6d</xref>). Interestingly, we found animals grown in 10% O<sub>2</sub> also consume more food than animals grown in 21% O<sub>2</sub>.

We used the CB4856 wild strain isolated from pineapple fields in Hawaii, which has relatively low relative fitness in laboratory conditions (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4b</xref>), taking advantage of a previously constructed NIL of <italic>npr-1</italic> introgressed from N2 into the CB4856 background (CX11400) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Bendesky et al., 2012</xref>) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6e</xref>). We found that the N2 region surrounding <italic>npr-1</italic> also conferred a fitness advantage in the CB4856 background (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6f</xref>). The estimated selective coefficients of the derived allele of <italic>npr-1</italic> was higher in the CB4856 background than the N2 background (s = 0.61 vs s = 0.30), potentially due to the lower relative fitness of the CB4856 strain. The food consumption of these strains was consistent with the fitness differences (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6g</xref>). The derived allele of <italic>npr-1</italic> increased food consumption in both genetic backgrounds but its effect was higher in CB4856.</p><p>Food is consumed from the environment by the periodic contraction and relaxation of the pharyngeal muscle which serves to bring material from the environment into the pharynx and filter out bacterial cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Fang-Yen et al., 2009</xref>). To test whether the increase in food consumption could be explained by an increase in the rate of pumping, we measured the pharyngeal pumping rate of the N2<italic><sub>glb-5, npr-1</sub></italic>, N2, CB4856, and CX11400 strains. The effects of the derived allele of <italic>npr-1</italic> was epistatic with respect to the N2 or CB4856 background. The derived allele decreased the pumping rate in the CB4856 background but had no effect in the N2 background (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6h</xref>). The effect of the derived allele of <italic>npr-1</italic> on pumping rate is surprising.

Besides its role in the biosynthesis of ascaroside pheromones, <italic>daf-22</italic> has recently been shown to play a distinct role in ASK neurons, where it is required for the metabolization of fatty acids that stimulate the endoplasmic reticulum stress response, promoting the transcription of insulin-like peptides that regulate dauer formation and other biological processes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib61">Park and Paik, 2017</xref>). <italic>daf-22</italic> mutants also accumulate massive amounts of fatty acids and fatty acyl-CoAs in their intestines (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Butcher et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib43">Joo et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib51">Li et al., 2016</xref>), which can potentially regulate feeding behavior through homeostasis mechanisms (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib40">Hyun et al., 2016</xref>).

These experiments suggest that the effects of the <italic>daf-22</italic> mutants we have observed might be independent of their role in producing ascaroside pheromones.</p></sec></sec><sec id="s3" sec-type="discussion"><title>Discussion</title><p>In this report, we studied the fitness consequences of two derived alleles that arose and fixed in the N2 strain after isolation from the wild. We find that both alleles can be adaptive, with selective coefficients that are larger than many characterized beneficial alleles from other species. These results are consistent with the derived alleles spreading through the ancestral N2 populations due to positive selection. If this was true, it would suggest that the derived allele of <italic>npr-1</italic> arose first, as the derived <italic>glb-5</italic> allele is only beneficial in this derived genetic background. However, the demographic history and laboratory environment of how N2 was grown at the time these alleles arose is largely lost (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib66">Sterken et al., 2015</xref>). The exact laboratory growth conditions (liquid axenic vs. solid media), transfer processes (picking vs. chunking) and effective population sizes (between 4 and 1000) used to propagate a <italic>C. elegans</italic> strain is incredibly variable. It is likely that the evolutionary forces responsible for the fixation of these alleles will remain lost to history.</p><p>Nevertheless, the ability of positive selection to act upon the derived <italic>npr-1</italic> allele can be observed in current experiments. A recent example is provided by Noble and colleagues, who created a large mapping population between 16 parental strains (including N2 and CB4856) to create a large panel recombinant inbred lines (RILs) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib58">Noble et al., 2017</xref>). During the outcrossing phase of construction, the N2 allele of <italic>npr-1</italic> spread through the population to fixation, consistent with its dominant action and the strong selective advantage of this allele. Potentially, variation in <italic>npr-1</italic> affected allele frequencies of unlinked loci as well. For example, an excess of CB4856 haplotypes was observed in the RILs, suggesting that CB4856 haplotypes were more likely to contain beneficial alleles. Our measurements of the relative fitness of the CB4856 strain, however, creates an apparent paradox, as CB4856 was one of the least fit strains among the wild strains we tested (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4b</xref>). Potentially, epistatic interactions between CB4856 alleles and the derived allele of <italic>npr-1</italic> could help resolve this; the effect of <italic>npr-1</italic> on food intake and fitness is higher in the CB4856 background (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6f,g</xref>). Differences in effect size of a focal allele in different genetic backgrounds is considered evidence for the existence of epistasis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Gibson and Dworkin, 2004</xref>). Potentially, the presence of laboratory-derived alleles in mapping populations will skew not only the allele frequencies of these beneficial alleles, but also natural genetic variants that interact epistatically with them.</p><p>Evolution of behavioral traits is one strategy for animals to respond to a new environment. The identification of a polymorphism in <italic>npr-1</italic> has served as an example of how behavioral variation can arise from genetic variation. However, our work suggests that the social/solitary feeding behavioral changes of N2 are not sufficient for explaining its fitness gains. Rather, we propose that changes to food intake, sexual maturity, and fecundity are more important. One unresolved question is why wild strains do not eat as much food as the N2 strain. We believe there must be some sort of tradeoff – either energetically or developmentally – that makes the derived mutation unfavorable in their natural environments. Mechanistic understanding of the energetic forces necessary for <italic>C. elegans</italic> to bring food into their pharynx is lacking. In fact, pharyngeal pumping rates are often used as proxies for food intake, which we have shown here can be unrelated to the amount of food consumed. Potentially, the thick slurry of food in laboratory plates is completely different biophysically from the mixed bacterial species encountered on rotting material in the wild. Alternatively, differences in feeding behaviors unrelated to social/solitary behaviors might also mediate the differences in food intake. Our experiments suggest that previously described roaming/dwelling differences are also not responsible, however, additional uncharacterized behavioral differences could influence food intake.</p><p>The changes to fitness and food consumption in the N2 strain appear to be mediated by the nervous system, which we propose occurs through changes in the function and/or downstream effects of the URX sensory neurons. In this paper, we have also shown that animals that lack the URX neurons consume food at lower rates. How does URX modify food consumption? One possibility is URX regulates pharyngeal neurons extrasynaptically through neuropeptides or through chemical synapses onto the RIP interneurons, which represent the only connection between the somatic and pharyngeal nervous system. Alternatively, URX could regulate food consumption indirectly by stimulating metabolism of fatty acids. URX, along with AQR and PQR, are body cavity neurons, sending ciliated dendrites into the coelomic fluid, which serves as the circulatory system for <italic>C. elegans</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib72">White et al., 1986</xref>). Besides sensing external O<sub>2</sub>, URX neurons monitor fat stores, which are thought to regulate tonic Ca<sup>++</sup> responses of the URX neurons (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib73">Witham et al., 2016</xref>). URX, in turn, can stimulate fat loss, creating a homeostatic loop that ensures that fat mobilization only occurs when there are sufficient fat reserves and when environmental O<sub>2</sub> is high enough to metabolize the fatty acids into energy (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib73">Witham et al., 2016</xref>). The changes to the N2 strain could have resulted in URX triggering fatty acid metabolism at a higher rate in laboratory conditions. The access energy could be used to speed development and increase growth. Why, then, would the animals consume more food? Fat metabolism has been shown to regulate satiety behavior in <italic>C. elegans</italic>, which could account for increases in food consumption we see in these strains (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib40">Hyun et al., 2016</xref>).</p><p>This model could also explain the effects we see in the <italic>daf-22</italic> mutants, which we originally explored for the potential role of pheromone responses in feeding and fitness changes. <italic>daf-22</italic> mutants accumulate large amounts of fatty acids in their bodies, which potentially inhibits the food consumption rates of these animals. However, our experiments do not preclude a role for pheromones in these fitness and food consumption changes to N2. Potentially, our crude purifications do not capture physiologically relevant levels and ratios of the complex pheromone mixtures. Pheromones might also contribute to these differences in combination with other <italic>daf-22-</italic>dependent pathways. Primer pheromones have been shown to influence body fat metabolism in <italic>C. elegans</italic> through the ADL sensory neuron (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">Hussey et al., 2017</xref>). ADL sensory neurons are regulated by pheromones in an <italic>npr-1</italic>-dependent manner (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Abergel et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Fenk and de Bono, 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib41">Jang et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib42">Jang et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib53">Macosko et al., 2009</xref>). It is possible these changes, or other parts of the pheromone circuits are also necessary. Future experiments, enabled by the development of the on-plate food consumption assay, should be enlightening.</p><p>Our work underscores issues with growing organisms in the laboratory for multiple generations. Despite the attempts of researchers to create fertile conditions for nematodes to grow in, we found a large difference in relative fitness between different strains of <italic>C. elegans</italic> when competed in the laboratory. Natural genetic variation and de novo variation both result in fitness differences that selection can act on. Experimenters using wild strains of nematodes must take care in designing experiments to account for this, especially in wild strains with lower initial fitness levels. We believe that the laboratory selection pressures we characterized here will generalize to other invertebrate and vertebrate animals. If so, the behaviors and physiology of these animals will also be modified over generations of growth. Our work suggests that not only will the traits that confer fitness advantages be modified, but potentially additional traits due to the pleiotropic actions of many genes, and relaxed stabilizing selection on traits in laboratory conditions.</p></sec><sec id="s4" sec-type="materials|methods"><title>Materials and methods</title><table-wrap id="keyresource" position="anchor"><label>Key resources

The animals were mixed by inversion and allowed to stand for approximately one minute to settle adult animals. 50 uL of the supernatant containing ~1000–2000 L1-L2 animals were seeded on next plates. The remaining animals were concentrated and placed in a −80°C freezer for future genomic DNA isolation. Genomic DNA was collected from every odd generation using a Zymo DNA isolation kit (D4071).</p><p>To quantify the relative proportion of each strain, we used a digital PCR based approach using a custom TaqMan probe (Applied Biosciences). Genomic DNA was digested with EcoRI for 30 min at 37<sup>°C</sup>. The digested products were purified using a Zymo DNA cleanup kit (D4064) and diluted to ~1 ng/μL for the following Taqman assay. Four TaqMan probes were designed using ABI custom software that targeted the <italic>dpy-10 (kah82), dpy-10 (kah84), npr-1(g320),</italic> or SNP WBVar00209467 in <italic>glb-5</italic>. These probes were validated using defined concentrations of DNA from animals containing each allele. The Taqman digital PCR assays were performed using a Biorad QX200 digital PCR machine with standard probe absolute quantification protocol. The relative allele proportion was calculated for each DNA sample using count number of the droplet with fluorescence signal (<xref ref-type="disp-formula" rid="equ7">Equation 1</xref>). To calculate the relative fitness of the two strains using three to four measurements of relative fitness, we used linear regression to fit this data to a one-locus generic selection model (<xref ref-type="disp-formula" rid="equ5 equ6">Equations 2 and 3</xref>), assuming one generation per transfer.<disp-formula id="equ1"><label>(1)</label><mml:math id="m1"><mml:msub><mml:mrow><mml:mi>P</mml:mi><mml:mo>(</mml:mo><mml:mi>A</mml:mi><mml:mo>)</mml:mo></mml:mrow><mml:mrow><mml:mi>t</mml:mi></mml:mrow></mml:msub><mml:mo>=</mml:mo> <mml:mi mathvariant="normal"/><mml:mfrac><mml:mrow><mml:mi>N</mml:mi><mml:mi>o</mml:mi><mml:mo>.</mml:mo> <mml:mi/><mml:mi>A</mml:mi><mml:mi>l</mml:mi><mml:mi>l</mml:mi><mml:mi>e</mml:mi><mml:mi>l</mml:mi><mml:mi>e</mml:mi> <mml:mi/><mml:mi>A</mml:mi></mml:mrow><mml:mrow><mml:mi>N</mml:mi><mml:mi>o</mml:mi><mml:mo>.</mml:mo> <mml:mi/><mml:mi>A</mml:mi><mml:mi>l</mml:mi><mml:mi>l</mml:mi><mml:mi>e</mml:mi><mml:mi>l</mml:mi><mml:mi>e</mml:mi> <mml:mi/><mml:mi>A</mml:mi><mml:mo>+</mml:mo> <mml:mi/><mml:mi>N</mml:mi><mml:mi>o</mml:mi><mml:mo>.</mml:mo> <mml:mi/><mml:mi>A</mml:mi><mml:mi>l</mml:mi><mml:mi>l</mml:mi><mml:mi>e</mml:mi><mml:mi>l</mml:mi><mml:mi>e</mml:mi> <mml:mi/><mml:mi>a</mml:mi></mml:mrow></mml:mfrac></mml:math></disp-formula><disp-formula id="equ2"><label>(2)</label><mml:math id="m2"><mml:msub><mml:mrow><mml:mi>P</mml:mi><mml:mo>(</mml:mo><mml:mi>A</mml:mi><mml:mo>)</mml:mo></mml:mrow><mml:mrow><mml:mi>t</mml:mi></mml:mrow></mml:msub><mml:mo>=</mml:mo> <mml:mi/><mml:mfrac><mml:mrow><mml:msub><mml:mrow><mml:mi>P</mml:mi><mml:mo>(</mml:mo><mml:mi>A</mml:mi><mml:mo>)</mml:mo></mml:mrow><mml:mrow><mml:mn>0</mml:mn></mml:mrow></mml:msub><mml:msup><mml:mrow><mml:msub><mml:mrow><mml:mi>W</mml:mi></mml:mrow><mml:mrow><mml:mi>A</mml:mi><mml:mi>A</mml:mi></mml:mrow></mml:msub></mml:mrow><mml:mrow><mml:mi>t</mml:mi></mml:mrow></mml:msup></mml:mrow><mml:mrow><mml:msub><mml:mrow><mml:mi>P</mml:mi><mml:mo>(</mml:mo><mml:mi>A</mml:mi><mml:mo>)</mml:mo></mml:mrow><mml:mrow><mml:mn>0</mml:mn></mml:mrow></mml:msub><mml:msup><mml:mrow><mml:msub><mml:mrow><mml:mi>W</mml:mi></mml:mrow><mml:mrow><mml:mi>A</mml:mi><mml:mi>A</mml:mi></mml:mrow></mml:msub></mml:mrow><mml:mrow><mml:mi>t</mml:mi></mml:mrow></mml:msup><mml:mo>+</mml:mo> <mml:mi/><mml:msub><mml:mrow><mml:mo>(</mml:mo><mml:mn>1</mml:mn><mml:mo>-</mml:mo> <mml:mi/><mml:mi>P</mml:mi><mml:mo>(</mml:mo><mml:mi>A</mml:mi><mml:mo>)</mml:mo></mml:mrow><mml:mrow><mml:mn>0</mml:mn></mml:mrow></mml:msub><mml:mo>)</mml:mo><mml:msup><mml:mrow><mml:msub><mml:mrow><mml:mi>W</mml:mi></mml:mrow><mml:mrow><mml:mi>a</mml:mi><mml:mi>a</mml:mi></mml:mrow></mml:msub></mml:mrow><mml:mrow><mml:mi>t</mml:mi></mml:mrow></mml:msup></mml:mrow></mml:mfrac></mml:math></disp-formula><disp-formula id="equ3"><label>(3)</label><mml:math id="m3"><mml:mstyle displaystyle="true" scriptlevel="0"><mml:mrow><mml:mrow><mml:mi mathvariant="italic">l</mml:mi><mml:mi mathvariant="italic">o</mml:mi><mml:mi mathvariant="italic">g</mml:mi></mml:mrow><mml:mrow><mml:mo>(</mml:mo><mml:mfrac><mml:mrow><mml:mfrac><mml:mrow><mml:mi>P</mml:mi><mml:msub><mml:mrow><mml:mo>(</mml:mo><mml:mi>A</mml:mi><mml:mo>)</mml:mo></mml:mrow><mml:mrow><mml:mn>0</mml:mn></mml:mrow></mml:msub></mml:mrow><mml:mrow><mml:mi>P</mml:mi><mml:msub><mml:mrow><mml:mo>(</mml:mo><mml:mi>A</mml:mi><mml:mo>)</mml:mo></mml:mrow><mml:mrow><mml:mi>t</mml:mi></mml:mrow></mml:msub></mml:mrow></mml:mfrac><mml:mtext> </mml:mtext><mml:mo>−</mml:mo><mml:mtext> </mml:mtext><mml:mi>P</mml:mi><mml:msub><mml:mrow><mml:mo>(</mml:mo><mml:mi>A</mml:mi><mml:mo>)</mml:mo></mml:mrow><mml:mrow><mml:mn>0</mml:mn></mml:mrow></mml:msub></mml:mrow><mml:mrow><mml:mn>1</mml:mn><mml:mo>−</mml:mo><mml:mtext> </mml:mtext><mml:mi>P</mml:mi><mml:msub><mml:mrow><mml:mo>(</mml:mo><mml:mi>A</mml:mi><mml:mo>)</mml:mo></mml:mrow><mml:mrow><mml:mn>0</mml:mn></mml:mrow></mml:msub></mml:mrow></mml:mfrac><mml:mo>)</mml:mo></mml:mrow><mml:mo>=</mml:mo><mml:mtext> </mml:mtext><mml:mrow><mml:mo>(</mml:mo><mml:mrow><mml:mrow><mml:mi mathvariant="italic">l</mml:mi><mml:mi mathvariant="italic">o</mml:mi><mml:mi mathvariant="italic">g</mml:mi></mml:mrow><mml:mrow><mml:mo>(</mml:mo><mml:mfrac><mml:msub><mml:mi>W</mml:mi><mml:mrow><mml:mi>a</mml:mi><mml:mi>a</mml:mi></mml:mrow></mml:msub><mml:msub><mml:mi>W</mml:mi><mml:mrow><mml:mi>A</mml:mi><mml:mi>A</mml:mi></mml:mrow></mml:msub></mml:mfrac><mml:mo>)</mml:mo></mml:mrow></mml:mrow><mml:mo>)</mml:mo></mml:mrow><mml:mi>t</mml:mi></mml:mrow></mml:mstyle></mml:math></disp-formula></p></sec><sec id="s4-4"><title>Aerotaxis assays</title><p>To measure bordering rates, 2-week-old NGM plates were removed from a 4°C cold room, seeded with 200 μL of <italic>E. coli</italic> OP50 and incubated for 2 days at room temperature. 150 adult animals were picked onto these assay plates and placed in either a 20°C incubator or a BioSpherix chamber for 3 hr.

A lightly edited version of the letter sent to the authors after peer review is shown, indicating the most substantive concerns; minor comments are not usually included.</p></boxed-text><p>Thank you for submitting your article &quot;Solitary feeding behavior in <italic>Caenorhabditis elegans</italic> is a nonadaptive side effect of extended laboratory evolution&quot; for consideration by <italic>eLife</italic>. Your article has been reviewed by three peer reviewers, including Yuichi Iino as the Reviewing Editor and Reviewer #1, and the evaluation has been overseen by Patricia Wittkopp as the Senior Editor. The following individual involved in review of your submission has agreed to reveal their identity: Young-Jai You (Reviewer #2).</p><p>The reviewers have discussed the reviews with one another and the Reviewing Editor has drafted this decision to help you prepare a revised submission.</p><p>Summary:</p><p>In their manuscript, McGrath and colleagues explore the reason for N2 fitness under laboratory conditions. Or in other words, what is the selective advantage of the <italic>glb-5</italic>(Bristol)/<italic>npr-1</italic>(215V) allelic combination. Using competition assays, NGS, behavioral, and physiological measurements they show that the above allelic combination increases feeding efficiency and fertility. Moreover, they show that this fitness advantage is regulated by the URX-RMG circuit in a pheromone-dependent manner.</p><p>The necessary experiments were performed very nicely and thoroughly. The logic for each experiment is clearly written. The data are presented very nicely.</p><p>Essential revisions:</p><p>1) Because <italic>daf-22</italic> is required for peroxisomal fatty acid β-oxidation which is important for metabolism and growth, it is not clear whether the <italic>daf-22</italic> effects in fitness is solely due to absence of pheromone. In Figure 5C and D, authors observed a strong effect of the <italic>daf-22</italic> mutation on both number of eggs and food intake. Reviewers strongly suggest that authors try adding crude pheromones to the <italic>daf-22</italic> mutants to see whether these defects are (at least partially) rescued by addition of pheromones. Reviewers are aware that if the results are not as expected (rescue of the defects), it does not necessarily exclude the possibility that lack of the pheromones is the cause, but if it does rescue, the results will strengthen the authors' claim. If authors decide not to perform these tests, they need to explicitly state the possibility of the metabolic effect described above.</p><p>2) Previous studies show that eating live OP50 decreases worms' lifespan (Garigan et al., 2002; Gems and Riddle, 2000). Could it be that the derived <italic>glb-5/npr-1</italic> make N2 more resistant to OP50-toxicity? If so, the fitness of CX12311 should be similar to N2 on dead OP50. Authors need to test this possibility.</p><p>3) All reviewers agree that in the current manuscript, it is unclear how 'increased feeding rate', 'changes to the neural circuits' and 'controlling pheromone responses' are connected. This is partly due to the writing, namely scarcity (or lack) of discussion on the mechanical effect of pheromones. Authors just say, for example, &quot;changes to social/solitary behavior in N2 were a pleiotropic consequence of changes to integrated O2 and pheromone neural circuits that regulate feeding rate&quot; (Abstract), but no further statements. Based on the results provided, regulation of the URX-RMG circuit or BAG, ADF or ASG by pheromone is likely to be controlling the fitness. In fact, ADL/ASK/RMG neurons have been shown to respond to pheromone in an npr-1-dependent manner in Macosko et al., 2009 (Barmann lab) and in https://doi.org/10.1073/pnas.1621274114 (de Bono lab), for example. Also, a recent study by the de Bono lab shows that &quot;N2 animals were more strongly repelled by 10 nM C9 than <italic>npr-1</italic> animals&quot; (https://doi.org/10.1073/pnas.1618934114). Moreover, they show that the O2-sensor <italic>gcy-35</italic> is important for the attraction of <italic>npr-1</italic> worms to pheromones. Authors need to cite these papers and discuss the possibility that this circuit may be regulated by pheromones and in turn regulate food intake. They do not need to do further experiments to test the hypotheses, but discussing it (as above or in some other way) will improve the readability of the paper.</p><p>4) Figure 5A suggests that the derived allele of <italic>glb-5</italic>, i.e. <italic>glb-5</italic>(Bri), decreases the fitness of worms by acting in other neurons than AQR, PQR, and URX (e.g. BAG, ADF, or ASG). However, this is not proven, because, as indicated by the authors, <italic>glb-5</italic> introgressed region is ~290 kb in size, and therefore the observed results can be due to variations other than that of <italic>glb-5</italic>. If the authors are to claim that <italic>glb-5</italic>(Bri) acts in neurons other than AQR, PQR, URX, they need to generate QG1 transgenes expressing <italic>glb-5</italic>(Haw) (the non-derived <italic>glb-5</italic>) in these neurons or BAG, ADF, ASG (or non-neural tissues, Persson et al., 2009) and compare their fitness and/or food-consumption.</p><p>5) The title is overselling the results.

As the reviewers rightly pointed out, <italic>daf-22</italic> also has a role in peroxisomal fatty acid β-oxidation. As requested, we performed experiments to attempt to rescue the fitness-proximal traits using partially purified crude pheromone extracts. We focused on food consumption and reproductive timing assays, using two concentrations of crude pheromone. In these experiments, we were unable to rescue the <italic>daf-22</italic> phenotype for either trait.</p><p>There are a number of potential reasons that prevent us from ruling out a role for pheromones in these traits – 1) the crude pheromone purification is taken from supernatant produced from worms grown in liquid culture which likely alters the release/concentrations of many of the individual components, 2) the purification procedure using lyophilization followed by ethanol extraction might not purify all the individual pheromone components equally, 3) the concentrations we have used are not physiological for these traits, and 4) pheromones might be necessary but not sufficient, and additional <italic>daf-22</italic>-dependent molecular pathways also contribute.</p><p>It is beyond the scope of work that can be accomplished in the two month deadline to try to distinguish between the various roles that <italic>daf-22</italic> can play. For this resubmission, we have chosen to include all new data as figures, and have rewritten the text to downplay the role that pheromones play in the fitness circuits throughout the paper. We have also included a Discussion paragraph to discuss the possible roles that <italic>daf-22</italic> might play to modify fitness and food consumption rates, including in regulating metabolism.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>2) Previous studies show that eating live OP50 decreases worms' lifespan (Garigan et al., 2002; Gems and Riddle, 2000).

In both conditions, the N2 strain was more fit than the CX12311 animals, indicating resistance to OP50 toxicity cannot be the only cause of fitness differences between the strains. There was a significant quantitative difference in relative fitness between the two conditions, however, we point out that directly comparing these values is difficult, as the heat-killed bacteria do not support the same level of population growth as a live bacteria plate. We have included these data in Figure 3.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>3) All reviewers agree that in the current manuscript, it is unclear how 'increased feeding rate', 'changes to the neural circuits' and 'controlling pheromone responses' are connected.
