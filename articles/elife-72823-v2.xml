Axon degeneration in injury and disease is promoted by activation of the NAD-consuming enzyme SARM1. Here, we report a novel activator of SARM1, a metabolite of the pesticide and neurotoxin vacor. Removal of SARM1 completely rescues mouse neurons from vacor-induced neuron and axon death in vitro and in vivo. We present the crystal structure of the <italic>Drosophila</italic> SARM1 regulatory domain complexed with this activator, the vacor metabolite VMN, which as the most potent activator yet known is likely to support drug development for human SARM1 and NMNAT2 disorders. This study indicates the mechanism of neurotoxicity and pesticide action by vacor, raises important questions about other pyridines in wider use today, provides important new tools for drug discovery, and demonstrates that removing SARM1 can robustly block programmed axon death induced by toxicity as well as genetic mutation.</p></abstract><kwd-group kwd-group-type="author-keywords"><kwd>axon

(SARM1) plays a central, pro-degenerative role in programmed axon death (including Wallerian degeneration) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib47">Osterloh et al., 2012</xref>). This axon degeneration pathway is activated in a number of neurodegenerative contexts, including in human disease (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Coleman and Höke, 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Gilley et al., 2021</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Huppke et al., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib41">Lukacs et al., 2019</xref>). SARM1 has a critical nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide (NAD) cleavage (NADase) activity, which is activated when its upstream regulator and axon survival factor nicotinamide mononucleotide adenylyltransferase 2 (NMNAT2) is depleted or inactive (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Essuman et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Gilley et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Gilley and Coleman, 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib50">Sasaki et al., 2020a</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib49">Sasaki et al., 2016</xref>). NMNAT2 loss causes accumulation of its substrate nicotinamide mononucleotide (NMN), which promotes axon degeneration (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Di Stefano et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib40">Loreto et al., 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">Loreto et al., 2015</xref>). NMN is now known to activate SARM1 NADase activity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib58">Zhao et al., 2019</xref>). Given that <italic>Sarm1</italic> deletion confers robust axon protection, and even lifelong protection against lethality caused by NMNAT2 deficiency (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Gilley et al., 2017</xref>), SARM1 has become a very attractive therapeutic target to prevent neurodegeneration.</p><p>In the past 2 years, there has been intense focus on structure-activity studies of SARM1 to help drive drug development. Recent structural data revealed the existence of an allosteric pocket in SARM1 armadillo-repeat (ARM) domain which is important for the regulation of SARM1 activity. NMN binds to this pocket, leading to SARM1 activation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Figley et al., 2021</xref>). NAD (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">Jiang et al., 2020</xref>) can also bind the same allosteric site, competing with NMN to prevent SARM1 activation. The ratio between NMN:NAD is therefore important to regulate SARM1 activity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Figley et al., 2021</xref>) and we have recently extended this to show that, at physiological levels, changes in NMN levels have the greater impact on the regulation of SARM1 activity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Angeletti et al., 2021</xref>). Further understanding how SARM1 activity is regulated by small molecules will help develop ways to block its activation.</p><p>Here, we have investigated whether vacor, a disused pesticide and powerful neurotoxin associated with human peripheral and central nervous system disorders (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Gallanosa et al., 1981</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">LeWitt, 1980</xref>) and axon degeneration in rats (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib55">Watson and Griffin, 1987</xref>), causes activation of programmed axon death. Vacor is a pyridine derivative that is metabolised to vacor mononucleotide (VMN) and vacor adenine dinucleotide (VAD) through a two-step conversion by nicotinamide phosphoribosyltransferase (NAMPT) and NMNAT2 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1A</xref>). Considering VAD inhibits SARM1 regulator NMNAT2 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Buonvicino et al., 2018</xref>), we reasoned that vacor may induce SARM1-dependent axon death. We demonstrate that vacor neurotoxicity is entirely mediated by SARM1 such that <italic>Sarm1</italic><sup>-/-</sup> neurons and their axons are completely resistant. We unexpectedly find that vacor metabolite VMN directly binds to and activates SARM1, causing neuronal death. This study elucidates the mechanism of action of vacor likely underlying its lethal neurotoxic effect in humans. Vacor use is banned, but structurally related pyridines are widely-used and present in drugs, pesticides and food, raising important questions about their potential toxicity and SARM1 as a mediator of environmental neurotoxicity. Our findings also provide important new tools for drug discovery. To our knowledge, VMN is the most potent activator of SARM1 reported so far, and our structural data reveal essential information on SARM1 regulation which will aid drug development to block SARM1 activation.</p><fig id="fig1" position="float"><label>Figure 1.</label><caption><title>Vacor causes neurite degeneration in primary mouse neurons.</title><p>(<bold>A</bold>) Schematic representation of vacor conversion into VMN and VAD by NAMPT and NMNAT2, respectively. VAD has been reported to inhibit NMNAT2 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Buonvicino et al., 2018</xref>). Vacor competes with NAM for NAMPT.

Interestingly, unlike axotomy, activation of the pathway by vacor also caused SARM1-dependent cell death (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2I</xref>), similar to that previously reported with constitutively active SARM1 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Gerdts et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Gerdts et al., 2013</xref>). To explore this further, we cultured DRG neurons in microfluidic chambers, to allow independent manipulation of the neurite and soma compartments. Addition of vacor to either compartment directly activated local death of cell bodies and/or neurites. However, while vacor-induced cell death also causes neurite degeneration, the reverse was not true: no cell loss was observed after local induction of distal neurite degeneration by vacor (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s2">Figure 2—figure supplement 2A,B</xref>). Intriguingly, the degeneration of neurites in the soma-treated cultures is even more rapid that with direct treatment. Metabolite measurements in neurites after vacor treatment confirmed this involves SARM1 activation (Figure 4D). This suggests there may be components both of conventional Wallerian degeneration following loss of soma support and a possible spreading of SARM1 activation within the cell, possibly as a consequence of the proposed positive feedback upon NAD depletion (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Figley et al., 2021</xref>).</p></sec><sec id="s2-2"><title><italic>Sarm1</italic> deletion confers functional and morphological protection of neurons against vacor toxicity in vivo</title><p>We next sought to validate our findings in vivo.

Surprisingly, while SARM1 activation was confirmed by a drastic SARM1-dependent decline in NAD and increase in cADPR following vacor administration, NMN did not rise and even fell slightly (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4A–D</xref>).

Crucially, NMN deamidase, an enzyme that strongly preserves axotomised axons by preventing NMN accumulation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4E</xref>; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s1">Figure 4—figure supplement 1A</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Di Stefano et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Di Stefano et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">Loreto et al., 2015</xref>), was also unable to protect against vacor toxicity (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4E and F</xref>), even though recombinant NMN deamidase retains its ability to convert NMN to nicotinic acid mononucleotide (NaMN) in the presence of vacor, VMN and VAD (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s1">Figure 4—figure supplement 1B</xref>).

However, we now show that exogenous application of its analogue, VMN, does induce SARM1-dependent death of uninjured DRG neurites (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5B and C</xref>).

VMN-dependent activation of SARM1 being the effector of vacor toxicity is also supported by several other findings. First, unlike NMN, VMN is not a substrate of NMN deamidase (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5s1">Figure 5—figure supplement 1D</xref>), thus explaining its inability to protect against vacor neurotoxicity (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4E and F</xref>). In addition, VMN is not a substrate of the nuclear isoform NMNAT1 and is a poor substrate of mitochondrial NMNAT3 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Buonvicino et al., 2018</xref>), so VMN accumulation in cell bodies (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5s1">Figure 5—figure supplement 1E</xref>) and subsequent SARM1 activation, as detected by a rise of cADPR in this compartment (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4D</xref>), provides a clear rationale for why vacor administration also causes cell death.</p></sec><sec id="s2-5"><title>VMN activates SARM1 through direct binding to SARM1 ARM domain</title><p>SARM1 ARM domain is believed to maintain SARM1 in an inhibited state (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Figley et al., 2021</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Gerdts et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">Jiang et al., 2020</xref>).

To further characterise this interaction, we determined the crystal structure of the VMN-bound dSARM1<sup>ARM</sup> (1.69 Å resolution). dSARM1<sup>ARM</sup> contains eight tandem armadillo repeats (ARM1-8) stacking into an unusually compact right-handed superhelix (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6A</xref>; <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="supp1">Supplementary file 1</xref>).

The interaction is mediated by two pi-stacking interactions between the indole of W385 and the pyridine moiety of VMN, and between the imidazole ring of H392 and the nitrobenzene moiety of VMN (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6B</xref>; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6s2">Figure 6—figure supplement 2A,B</xref>); and eight hydrogen bonds, with a buried surface area of ~910 Å<sup>2</sup> (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6B</xref>; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6s2">Figure 6—figure supplement 2A,B</xref>).

VMN-bound dSARM1<sup>ARM</sup> adopts a similar conformation to NMN-bound dSARM1<sup>ARM</sup> (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6C</xref>). Comparison of the two structures reveals that the NMN moiety of VMN and NMN share the same binding mode, with the key residues involved in NMN binding interacting with the analogous portions of the VMN molecule (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6B</xref>). Importantly, in the NMN-bound structure, NMN forms a hydrogen bond with the residues H599 and G600 (loop connecting ARM6 and 7), while in the VMN-bound structure, due to the extra portion of VMN (urea and nitrobenzene groups) extending to the region between the N- and C-termini of the protein, two different hydrogen bonds are formed between VMN and H392 (ARM2 H1) at the N-terminus, and N640 (ARM8 H1) at the C-terminus. Furthermore, the pi-stacking interaction between H392 and the nitrobenzene of VMN is specific to this compound. These different and extra interactions VMN forms could explain why VMN induces SARM1 activation more efficiently, compared to NMN. The compaction seen in both NMN and VMN-bound dSARM1<sup>ARM</sup> structures likely represents the conformation of the ARM domain in active SARM1, based on the comparison with the more open crystal structures of ligand-free and NaMN-bound dSARM1<sup>ARM</sup>, as well as cryo-EM (electron microscopy) structures of ligand-free and NAD-bound hSARM1, representing the inactive state of the protein (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Bratkowski et al., 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Figley et al., 2021</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib53">Sporny et al., 2020</xref>) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6C</xref>). NaMN stabilises the open conformation of dSARM1<sup>ARM</sup> due to the rotation of its nicotinic acid (NA) portion towards the N-terminus of the protein, and is therefore unable to form any interactions with the C-terminal region of the protein (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib52">Sasaki et al., 2021</xref>). Although the corresponding pyridine moiety of VMN also has a similar rotation, the extended portion of VMN permits the interaction with the C-terminal region of the protein, hence maintaining a compact conformation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6C</xref>). In the NAD-bound hSARM1<sup>ARM</sup> structure, the portion of NAD equivalent to NMN and VMN interacts with the protein through similar interactions, but the adenine group and the adjacent ribose of NAD extend further down to the side of the region between the termini. This would cause steric clashes with the C-terminal region of the protein, particularly with the loop connecting ARM6 and 7 (residues 594–602), thus preventing NAD from inducing a more compact conformation in the ARM domain (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6s1">Figure 6—figure supplement 1C</xref>), keeping the protein in the inactive state. In summary, our data suggest that VMN activates SARM1 with a mechanism similar to NMN, but with some important differences, inducing a compaction of the ARM domain, destabilising its interfaces with the neighbouring ARM, SAM, and TIR domains, and eventually permitting the TIR domains to self-associate and hydrolyse NAD.</p></sec><sec id="s2-6"><title>Mutations in the VMN binding pocket of hSARM1 ARM domain prevent vacor toxicity</title><p>To validate the interactions observed in the crystal structure, we performed mutagenesis studies, focusing on the interactions associated with W385 (human W103), R437 (human R157), and K476 (human K193), because these residues are highly conserved and specifically interact with VMN through their side chains.

Crucially, the comparison between VMN and NMN-bound dSARM1<sup>ARM</sup> structures and the differences from the ligand-free and NAD-bound hSARM1<sup>ARM</sup> structures provide the explanation for the mechanism of how these ligands target the same allosteric site, but regulate SARM1 activity differently. The data not only provide support for a key physiological role of NMN in the regulation of SARM1 activity and axon degeneration, but given VMN’s greater potency than NMN, we anticipate that VMN and vacor will be important tools to support drug discovery in several ways. The identification of key residues in the ARM domain involved in the potent activation of SARM1 by VMN should facilitate rational drug design; further understanding why VMN activates SARM1 more potently than NMN could lead to the development of ligands with higher-affinity and selectivity to lock SARM1 in its inactive state. It will be important to expand also on VMN inhibition functions. Finally, we have also recently reported that recombinant hSARM1 uses vacor for base exchange to produce VAD (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Angeletti et al., 2021</xref>), suggesting that vacor can also directly interact with SARM1. Understanding whether base exchange is important for SARM1 pro-degenerative function is another important area of research.</p><p>Vacor is currently the most effective chemical to directly activate SARM1 and cause neuronal death, eliminating the need for complex axotomy experiments or the use of drugs with non-specific actions. The IVT vacor model we have developed could also be used for relatively rapid validation of drugs targeting SARM1 in vivo in rodents, with both morphological and functional readouts. Interestingly, it was previously reported that <italic>Sarm1</italic> deletion does not prevent RGC death following optic nerve crush in mice (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Fernandes et al., 2018</xref>). However, our data show that SARM1 activation is sufficient to drive degeneration of multiple types of retinal neuron (including RGC) in addition to photoreceptors (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib51">Sasaki et al., 2020b</xref>), making SARM1 a promising target to treat retinal degeneration, at least in response to certain insults. To explain these differences, we suggest that retrograde RGC soma death after axotomy proceeds by a different, SARM1-independent mechanism such as loss of retrogradely delivered trophic factors.</p><p>Our data also further implicate programmed axon death in human disease. It appears that this degeneration pathway can be aberrantly activated in humans not only by genetic mutation of <italic>NMNAT2</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Huppke et al., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib41">Lukacs et al., 2019</xref>), but also by SARM1 activation in severe neurotoxicity within hours of vacor ingestion (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">LeWitt, 1980</xref>). Although vacor use is banned, many other pyridines are widely used in our environment, and even directly administered to humans or ingested as pharmaceuticals, perfumes or food additives (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Adams and De Kimpe, 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">Li et al., 2016</xref>), raising important questions about their potential to activate SARM1 and cause axon degeneration or neuronal death. Indeed, one other nicotinamide analog, 3-acetyl pyridine, is already associated with axon degeneration (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Desclin and Escubi, 1974</xref>) and subsequent to our preprint of this work has now been reported to act through SARM1 in a similar manner (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib56">Wu et al., 2021</xref>). Genetic hyperactivation of SARM1 has also now been associated with amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Bloom et al., 2021</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Gilley et al., 2021</xref>).</p><p>Despite the extreme toxicity of vacor, SARM1 deficiency completely rescues neurons and preserves their functionality. Together with the previously reported lifelong protection in a genetic model of a rare human axonopathy (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Gilley et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib41">Lukacs et al., 2019</xref>), this further supports the therapeutic potential of blocking SARM1 to completely prevent programmed axon death. Lastly, as vacor causes pancreatic β-cell destruction and diabetes in humans (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Gallanosa et al., 1981</xref>), these findings could also have broader implications, uncovering a role for SARM1 in the survival of insulin producing cells and aiding research on diabetes. In conclusion, our study identifies a powerful SARM1 activator, advancing our understanding of how SARM1 activity is regulated and providing key support to drug discovery targeting programmed axon death.</p></sec><sec id="s4" sec-type="materials|methods"><title>Materials and methods</title><p>All studies conformed to the institution’s ethical requirements in accordance with the 1986 Animals (Scientific Procedures) Act under Project Licences PPL P98A03BF9 and PP1824519, and in accordance with the Association for Research in Vision and Ophthalmology’s Statement for the Use of Animals in Ophthalmic and Visual Research.</p><sec id="s4-1"><title>Primary neuronal cultures</title><p>DRG ganglia were dissected from C57BL/6J (RRID:<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://identifiers.org/RRID/RRID:IMSR_JAX:000664">IMSR_JAX:000664</ext-link>), <italic>Sarm1</italic><sup>-/-</sup> (RRID:<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://identifiers.org/RRID/RRID:MGI:3765957">MGI:3765957</ext-link>) and <italic>Wld<sup>S</sup></italic> (RRID:<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://identifiers.org/RRID/RRID:MGI:4438866">MGI:4438866</ext-link>) E13.5-E14.5 mouse embryos and SCG ganglia were dissected from postnatal day 0–2 mouse pups.

We also include an acceptance summary that explains what the editors found interesting or important about the work.</p></boxed-text><p><bold>Decision letter after peer review:</bold></p><p>Thank you for submitting your article &quot;Neurotoxin-mediated potent activation of the axon degeneration regulator SARM1&quot; for consideration by <italic>eLife</italic>. Your article has been reviewed by 3 peer reviewers, and the evaluation has been overseen by a Reviewing Editor and Suzanne Pfeffer as the Senior Editor. The following individuals involved in review of your submission have agreed to reveal their identity: Marc Freeman (Reviewer #2); Mohanish Deshmukh (Reviewer #3).</p><p>The reviewers have discussed their reviews with one another, in consultation with the Reviewing Editor. Among the comments, the overall enthusiasm is high and the results of vacor and its metabolite VMN as an activator of Sarm were considered to be well done and novel. The significance of the results and the structural data was also strong. Several revisions were recommended to improve the clarity and to extend the findings.</p><p>Essential revisions:</p><p>1) VMN is an activator of Sarm at low concentration and an inhibitor at high concentrations. Is VMN's inhibitory activity working on the active site? Is there any additional evidence for how VMN inhibits Sarm either through the active site or through an allosteric site. Two of the three reviewers requested further insight into this question and felt the answer would give mechanistic insight into a new activator and inhibitor of SARM.</p><p>2) Do high VMN concentrations (or vacor) inhibit axotomy induced axon degeneration? Any data to address this question should be included.</p><p>3) Some reorganization of the manuscript would be helpful. Many of the supplemental figures contains key data. They should be included with the four figures presently in the submission. The Introduction is dated and does not include consideration of the allosteric pocket.</p><p><italic>Reviewer #1 (Recommendations for the authors):</italic></p><p>1) Is the supplement to figure 1 the authors use compartment chambers to show that vacor can trigger local degeneration of cell bodies and axons. They state that with cell body application &quot;vacor-induced cell death causes eventual secondary neurite degeneration.&quot; However, in their data, cell body application of vacor causes more rapid and robust distal axon degeneration than does direct application of vacor to the distal axons. This is not consistent with the &quot;eventual neurite degeneration&quot; and suggests a different and more active mechanism of degeneration in that case. Is the axon degeneration in the distal compartment still Sarm dependent? This should at a minimum be discussed, and now that inhibitors of Sarm are available could be experimentally addressable.</p><p>2) The authors report that VMN not only activates Sarm, but also inhibits Sarm. The authors claims that this inhibitory function &quot;could reveal critical information on how Sarm activity is regulated,&quot; yet they do not attempt to understand the mechanism of inhibition. Is the inhibitory role of VMN working through the same allosteric pocket? Is it acting on the catalytic site in the enzyme? With the nice biochemical system the authors have established this seems easily addressable and would be an important addition to a manuscript describing how VMN regulates Sarm activity.</p><p>3) The introduction in this manuscript is quite similar to the version published on Bioarchive about a year ago. In that year, there has been tremendous progress in understanding the mechanism of Sarm activation, with the publication of four papers describing the structure of allosteric ligands binding to Sarm and the definition of the roles of NMN and NAD in Sarm activation/inhibition. The introduction should be updated in order to better place the current work in context.</p><p>4) There are only four figures but many supplemental figures that are quite important. The paper would be much easier to follow if it were re-organized into a more traditional 7-8 figure format.</p><p>5) The final sentence in the abstract claims that the study shows that Sarm can &quot;permanently block programmed axon death induced by toxicity.&quot; This is overstated, as the authors only show Sarm knockout protects for three days after a single vacor injection, and in vitro after two doses separated by two days. This does not speak to whether the protection is permanent, since this would require studies of long-term toxin exposure.</p><p>6) The manuscript would benefit from a more comprehensive analysis of how this work relates to prior work published by these authors. For example, the point mutants in the binding pocket of Sarm were previously analyzed by these authors for their role in NMN binding and Sarm activation. This should be mentioned and the findings compared.

Is VMN's inhibitory activity working on the active site? Is there any additional evidence for how VMN inhibits Sarm either through the active site or through an allosteric site. Two of the three reviewers requested further insight into this question and felt the answer would give mechanistic insight into a new activator and inhibitor of SARM.</p></disp-quote><p>We appreciate these comments. We agree that VMN-mediated inhibition of SARM1 is interesting and understanding how this inhibition works is certainly one of our future plans. We have started working towards this and our preliminary data suggest that the mechanism of inhibition might not simply be explained by VMN binding to the active or allosteric site. Therefore, unravelling how VMN inhibits SARM1 is likely to be a fairly substantial undertaking at this stage, which we feel goes beyond the scope of the current study. We prefer to keep the focus at present on the toxic effect of vacor and its metabolite VMN, along with the many exciting implications of this including drug development and the potential for activation of SARM1 by other environmental toxins.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>2) Do high VMN concentrations (or vacor) inhibit axotomy induced axon degeneration? Any data to address this question should be included.</p></disp-quote><p>We thank the reviewers for these interesting suggestions; there are, however, some experimental limitations which need to be considered. For instance, vacor is insoluble in culture media at concentrations higher than 100µM, limiting the range of concentrations that can be tested. We have treated axotomised neurites with 100µM vacor; as expected, we did not see protection as vacor is normally very toxic at this concentration.</p><p>Similarly, it is unclear how much VMN actually enters the cell, considering that it is a charged molecule. 500µM VMN (the concentration used in this study) is the first concentration that causes toxicity in neurons. This is substantially higher than the first toxic concentration of vacor (50µM), suggesting that VMN cell-permeability is limited. Therefore, reaching high enough concentrations of VMN in neurons to confer protection is challenging.</p><p>We would be happy to share preliminary data on these points for revision purposes, but we would prefer not to add these to the manuscript as interpretation of results in this instance is subject to many caveats.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>3) Some reorganization of the manuscript would be helpful. Many of the supplemental figures contains key data. They should be included with the four figures presently in the submission. The Introduction is dated and does not include consideration of the allosteric pocket.</p></disp-quote><p>We appreciate this feedback and have made the following changes to address reviewers’ comments:</p><p>– We have changed the format of the paper into a more traditional 7 figure paper. Some important data that were in supplementary have now been moved to the main text. Specifically, Figure 1 —figure supplement 1 is now Figure 1. We have added a comparison with the structure of SARM1 bound to NaMN. All structural data are now in Figure 6. Finally, we have moved all data on SARM1 mutants in figure 7.</p><p>– We have added a paragraph in the introduction to include the latest work in the field; [page 4, lines 62-70].</p><p>– We have made a number on minor changes in response to reviewers’ comments, detailed below. We have used the word tracked changes function to highlight changes to the text.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Reviewer #1 (Recommendations for the authors):</p><p>1) Is the supplement to figure 1 the authors use compartment chambers to show that vacor can trigger local degeneration of cell bodies and axons. They state that with cell body application &quot;vacor-induced cell death causes eventual secondary neurite degeneration.&quot; However, in their data, cell body application of vacor causes more rapid and robust distal axon degeneration than does direct application of vacor to the distal axons. This is not consistent with the &quot;eventual neurite degeneration&quot; and suggests a different and more active mechanism of degeneration in that case. Is the axon degeneration in the distal compartment still Sarm dependent? This should at a minimum be discussed, and now that inhibitors of Sarm are available could be experimentally addressable.</p></disp-quote><p>We thank the reviewer for pointing this out. We have discussed this important point in the main text; [page 7; lines 129-135].</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>2) The authors report that VMN not only activates Sarm, but also inhibits Sarm. The authors claims that this inhibitory function &quot;could reveal critical information on how Sarm activity is regulated,&quot; yet they do not attempt to understand the mechanism of inhibition. Is the inhibitory role of VMN working through the same allosteric pocket? Is it acting on the catalytic site in the enzyme? With the nice biochemical system the authors have established this seems easily addressable and would be an important addition to a manuscript describing how VMN regulates Sarm activity.</p></disp-quote><p>We appreciate these comments.

In that year, there has been tremendous progress in understanding the mechanism of Sarm activation, with the publication of four papers describing the structure of allosteric ligands binding to Sarm and the definition of the roles of NMN and NAD in Sarm activation/inhibition. The introduction should be updated in order to better place the current work in context.</p></disp-quote><p>We thank the reviewer for the suggestion. We have now updated the introduction to reflect recent developments in the field; [page 4, lines 62-70].</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>4) There are only four figures but many supplemental figures that are quite important. The paper would be much easier to follow if it were re-organized into a more traditional 7-8 figure format.</p></disp-quote><p>We have now reorganised the manuscript into a more traditional 7 figure format.

This does not speak to whether the protection is permanent, since this would require studies of long-term toxin exposure.</p></disp-quote><p>We thank the reviewer for pointing this out. We have changed the word “permanently” with “robustly” in the abstract.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>6) The manuscript would benefit from a more comprehensive analysis of how this work relates to prior work published by these authors. For example, the point mutants in the binding pocket of Sarm were previously analyzed by these authors for their role in NMN binding and Sarm activation. This should be mentioned and the findings compared. Similarly, there is a comparison of the crystal structure for NMN and NAD, but not for their recently described structure of Sarm bound to NAMN.</p></disp-quote><p>We thank the reviewer for this suggestion.
