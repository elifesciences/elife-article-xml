These errors arose by accidental oversight of changes late in the review process. Details of these errors and how they have been corrected are as follows:</p><p>1. We intended to reported amount of fat as milligrams of fat, but mistakenly reported the values as centigrams of fat, so the original values were 1 order of magnitude off from the units reported. We have updated these values to reflect the proper units of mg fat. No statistical relationships change (though a few p-values very slightly change and have been updated). These changes have been updated in the main text as well as the supplementary file.</p><p>2. In the methods, we mistakenly specified that &quot;We defined ‘arousal’ as periods where the rate of change of was greater than <italic>four</italic> standard deviations higher than the mean rate of change during the <italic>normothermic period before torpor</italic>;&quot; but the text should, and now does, instead read: “We defined ‘arousal’ as periods where the rate of change was greater than <italic>five</italic> times the standard deviation of the mean rate of change during the <italic>torpid</italic> period.”</p><p>3. In the results section, we incorrectly cited Figure 2A where we intended to cite Figure 2B: &quot;and lost more fat mass overnight (slope: 1.00±0.17 mgfat%fat–1, <italic>P</italic>&lt;0.001; Figure 2A).&quot; This citation has now been corrected to read “Figure 2B”.</p><p>The article has been corrected accordingly.</p></body></article>
