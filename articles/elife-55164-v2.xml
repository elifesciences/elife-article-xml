pathological states which cause cellular stress, including cancer. When over expressed, it causes dramatic weight reduction, suggesting a role in disease-related anorexia. Here, we demonstrate that the GDF15 receptor, GFRAL, is located in a subset of cholecystokinin neurons which span the area postrema and the nucleus of the tractus solitarius of the mouse. GDF15 activates GFRAL<sup>AP/NTS</sup> neurons and supports conditioned taste and place aversions, while the anorexia it causes can be blocked by a monoclonal antibody directed at GFRAL or by disrupting CCK neuronal signalling. The cancer-therapeutic drug, cisplatin, induces the release of GDF15 and activates GFRAL<sup>AP/NTS</sup> neurons, as well as causing significant reductions in food intake and body weight in mice. These metabolic effects of cisplatin are abolished by pre-treatment with the GFRAL monoclonal antibody. Our results suggest that GFRAL neutralising antibodies or antagonists may provide a co-treatment opportunity for patients undergoing chemotherapy.</p></abstract><kwd-group kwd-group-type="author-keywords"><kwd>GDF15</kwd><kwd>GFRAL</kwd><kwd>CCK</kwd><kwd>food intake</kwd><kwd>brainstem</kwd><kwd>cisplatin</kwd></kwd-group><kwd-group kwd-group-type="research-organism"><title>Research organism</title><kwd>Mouse</kwd><kwd>Rat</kwd></kwd-group><funding-group><award-group id="fund1"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100000268</institution-id><institution>Biotechnology and Biological Sciences Research Council</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>BB/M001067/1</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Luckman</surname><given-names>Simon M</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund2"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100000268</institution-id><institution>Biotechnology and Biological Sciences Research Council</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>BB/L021129/1</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Luckman</surname><given-names>Simon M</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund3"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100000265</institution-id><institution>Medical Research Council</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>MR/R002991/1</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Luckman</surname><given-names>Simon M</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund4"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100000265</institution-id><institution>Medical Research Council</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>MR/P009824/2</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>D'Agostino</surname><given-names>Giuseppe</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund5"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100000268</institution-id><institution>Biotechnology and Biological Sciences Research Council</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>BB/S008098/1</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Luckman</surname><given-names>Simon M</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund6"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100000770</institution-id><institution>University of Manchester</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>PhD Scholarship</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Shoop</surname><given-names>Rosemary</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><funding-statement>The funders had no role in study design, data collection and interpretation, or the decision to submit the work for publication.</funding-statement></funding-group><custom-meta-group><custom-meta specific-use="meta-only"><meta-name>Author impact statement</meta-name><meta-value>The GDF15 receptor, GFRAL,is expressed on a unique population of brainstem CCK neurons and mediates pathophysiological anorexia.</meta-value></custom-meta></custom-meta-group></article-meta></front><body><sec id="s1" sec-type="intro"><title>Introduction</title><p>The cytokine, GDF15 (a member of the TGF-β cytokine family, also known as MIC-1 and NAG-1), is expressed in several tissues throughout the body and circulates in the bloodstream of healthy humans (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Bootcov et al., 1997</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib53">Tsai et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib41">Patel et al., 2019</xref>).

Furthermore, over expression of GDF15 causes a dramatic reduction in food intake and weight loss (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib53">Tsai et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Johnen et al., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">Macia et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Chrysovergis et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib57">Xiong et al., 2017</xref>). Together, this has led to the supposition that GDF15 does not have a normal, physiological role but is, instead, secreted as an adaptive response to disease (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib41">Patel et al., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">Luan et al., 2019</xref>). This said, the transgenic knock out of GDF15 from the germline results in obesity, which could be interpreted that the cytokine has an alternative physiological function to regulate body weight (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib50">Tsai et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">Low et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib49">Tran et al., 2018</xref>).</p><p>The GDF15 receptor, GFRAL (GDNF-family receptor α-like) is located exclusively in a small population of cells in the in the area postrema (AP) and nucleus of the tractus solitarius (NTS) of the mouse dorsomedial medulla oblongata, (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">Mullican et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib58">Yang et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Emmerson et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Hsu et al., 2017</xref>) a brainstem region containing a number of characterised neurons that previously have been linked with appetite regulation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Luckman, 1992</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib44">Rinaman et al., 1993</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Larsen et al., 1997</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Lawrence et al., 2000</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">Luckman and Lawrence, 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Ellacott et al., 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">D'Agostino et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib45">Roman et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Frikke-Schmidt et al., 2019</xref>). Administration of recombinant GDF15 reduces food intake, but not in GFRAL knock-out mice (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">Mullican et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib58">Yang et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Emmerson et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Hsu et al., 2017</xref>). It also induces the cellular activation marker, Fos protein, in GFRAL-positive cells in the AP/NTS, and in putative downstream targets in the pons and amygdala, (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib57">Xiong et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Hsu et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Frikke-Schmidt et al., 2019</xref>), whereas selective surgical lesioning of the AP/NTS blocks the anorexic effects of the peptide (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib51">Tsai et al., 2014</xref>). The absolute identity of the primary responsive neurons has not been determined. Although a small number of GFRAL-positive neurons contain immunoreactivity for the catecholaminergic marker, tyrosine hydroxylase (TH), (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib58">Yang et al., 2017</xref>) relatively few TH-positive neurons are activated by exogenous GDF15 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib51">Tsai et al., 2014</xref>). We have extended these investigations and found that the highest proportion of GFRAL-positive neurons contain the neuropeptide transmitter, cholecystokinin (CCK). We demonstrate that GFRAL cells are a sub-population of CCK neurons, which respond to administration of GDF15 or the cancer therapeutic drug, cisplatin, but not to other anorectic signals. Additionally, the effect of GDF15 to inhibit food intake is abrogated by the targeted deletion of CCK-containing neurons in the AP/NTS or by pre-administration of a CCK receptor antagonist. A single injection of GDF15 causes marked conditioned taste and place aversions, suggesting a strong negative affect, as well as activating downstream pathways previously described as mediating anorexia. Lastly, since we can block GDF15- or cisplatin-induced anorexia by neutralising the GFRAL receptor with a selective monoclonal antibody, we suggest that the anorectic responses to disease and, potentially, their therapeutic treatment may be mediated by this distinct signalling pathway.</p></sec><sec id="s2" sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><sec id="s2-1"><title>GFRAL is localised to CCK-positive neurons in the AP/NTS</title><p>Mice expressing Cre recombinase under the control of neuropeptide genes, were crossed with a reporter mouse expressing enhanced Yellow Fluorescent Protein in a Cre-dependent fashion (Rosa26-eYFP), so that the double mutants expressed eYFP in discrete populations of CCK (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib48">Taniguchi et al., 2011</xref>), glutamate (VGlut2; gene <italic>Slc17a6</italic>), preproglucagon (PPG; gene <italic>Gcg</italic>) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib40">Parker et al., 2012</xref>) or prolactin-releasing peptide (PrRP; gene <italic>Prlh</italic>) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Dodd et al., 2014</xref>) neurons in the AP/NTS. Using antibodies against GFRAL, eYFP and TH, we were able to characterise putative, GDF15-sensitive cells. In the mouse, GFRAL was expressed in a continuous grouping of cells in the AP, extending into the medial region of the NTS (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1A</xref>), as noted previously by others (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">Mullican et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib58">Yang et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Emmerson et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Hsu et al., 2017</xref>). Although dense within the AP and more sparsely distributed in the NTS, there were similar numbers of GFRAL neurons in the two structures (20 ± 1 per section in both the AP and the NTS). 60% of GFRAL-immunoreactive cells in the AP co-localised with <italic>Cck</italic><sup>Cre</sup>::eYFP, though this proportion was 31% in the NTS (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1B</xref> and summary in <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="supp1">Supplementary file 1</xref>). We confirmed this pattern using RNAScope in situ hybridisation histology, which provided slightly higher values of 69% and 35% overlap in the AP and NTS, respectively (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1A</xref> and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="supp1">Supplementary file 1</xref>). Thus, overall, the majority of GFRAL neurons are CCKergic. By comparison, dual immunohistochemistry revealed that 27% of GFRAL neurons in the AP and 45% in the NTS contained TH (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1B</xref>). Overall, approximately, 15% of GFRAL neurons contained both CCK and TH (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1B</xref>). At least 54% GFRAL neurons in the AP co-localised with <italic>Slc17a6</italic><sup>Cre</sup>::eYFP, which fits with the consensus that CCK neurons in this brain region are glutamatergic (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1C</xref>). Finally, GFRAL cells were distinct from other NTS populations which contain either PrRP or PPG (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1B</xref>), which themselves either form a separate sub-population of TH neurons (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Dodd and Luckman, 2013</xref>) or overlap with other CCK cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Garfield et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1D</xref>), respectively. In conclusion, GFRAL cells appear to form a distinct subset of CCK neurons, a proportion of which also contain TH.</p><fig-group><fig id="fig1" position="float"><label>Figure 1.</label><caption><title>GFRAL-positive neurons in the AP and NTS co-localise with CCK.</title><p>(<bold>A</bold>) Schematic describing the distribution of GFRAL-immunoreactive cell bodies in the AP and dorsal NTS at different rostrocaudal levels relative to <italic>bregma</italic>.

Administration of GDF15 was associated with a negative affective valence, since a single injection supported a strong conditioned taste aversion (CTA) when paired with sucrose (see also <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib41">Patel et al., 2019</xref>), and a conditioned place aversion (CPA) in mice (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2C and D</xref>).

CGRP<sup>PBN</sup> neurons respond to a number of anorectic signals and may act as a point of convergence for different signalling pathways, themselves projecting forward to the CeA and elsewhere (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib56">Wu et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Carter et al., 2013</xref>).

Likewise, CCK<sup>NTS</sup> neurons also send direct projections to the PVH (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">D'Agostino et al., 2016</xref>). We confirmed this projection pattern using retrograde tracing, however, we showed that almost no GDF15-activated, GFRAL+ve or GFRAL-ve AP/NTS cells project directly to the PVH or to the ovBNST (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s1">Figure 3—figure supplement 1G and H</xref>). The most parsimonious conclusion is that GFRAL cells activated by GDF15 project directly to the PBN, which then activates downstream targets in the CeA, ovBNST and PVH. GFRAL cells may also synapse locally to activate other neuronal populations, including cells in the medial NTS. A very small number of these synaptically activated cells contain CCK or TH, and because almost none contain either PrRP, PPG or POMC, they may represent another distinct NTS phenotype. These GDF15-activated cells do not project to either the PBN or the ovBNST, but a few do project to the PVH. The others may represent local interneurons or potentially be responding to descending pathways.</p></sec><sec id="s2-4"><title>Blocking CCK signalling attenuates the anorexia caused by GDF15</title><p>To confirm the importance of GFRAL/CCK<sup>AP/NTS</sup> neurons in mediating the anorectic effects of GDF15, we used a recombinant adeno-associated virus (AAV) expressing a Cre-dependent designer pro-caspase and its activator, the Tobacco Etch Protease (flex-taCasp3-TEVp) to commit CCK<sup>AP/NTS</sup> neurons to cell-autonomous apoptosis. <italic>Cck</italic><sup>Cre</sup>::eYFP mice were injected into the AP/NTS with the AAV-caspase or an AAV expressing mCherry to control for viral load and transduction efficiency.

In fact, the only non-chronic disease situation described, in which GDF15 is up regulated, is <italic>hyperemesis gravidarum</italic> associated with intense nausea and vomiting in early pregnancy (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Fejzo et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib43">Petry et al., 2018</xref>). Thus, while we will not rule out a physiological role for GDF15, most of the literature seems to point towards it having a more significant role in sickness behaviour. This is strongly supported by our results that show that systemic administration of GDF15 causes robust conditioned taste aversion, conditioned place aversion and pica behaviour, and that blocking endogenous GFRAL signalling with a selective monoclonal antibody does not affect baseline food intake or body weight.</p><p>GFRAL-positive neurons span the AP and the inner border with the NTS, a region synonymous with responses to toxins and other nausea-inducing agents, and which lacks a blood-brain barrier (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">Miller and Leslie, 1994</xref>). The AP and NTS are also part of the dorsal vagal complex, which responds to gut-brain signalling. GFRAL is not expressed in the gut or in the vagus nerve, and since GDF15 is still effective at inducing anorexia in vagotomised rats, (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib58">Yang et al., 2017</xref>) the simplest conclusion is that circulating GDF15 acts directly on GFRAL expressed in the AP/NTS. We and others have argued for the existence of specific neuron types in this region of the brainstem which respond selectively to different sensory modalities (for example satiety versus nausea) in order to reduce food intake (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">Luckman and Lawrence, 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Kreisler et al., 2014</xref>). Thus, it is important to identify the phenotype of GFRAL cells. Although evidence has been provided that GFRAL is expressed in TH-positive catecholaminergic neurons, until now this has not been accurately quantified (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib58">Yang et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib51">Tsai et al., 2014</xref>). Here, using a variety of models, we conclude that the major, identifiable population of GFRAL neurons contain the neuropeptidergic transmitter, CCK. GFRAL-positive neurons respond to GDF15, but not with many other stimuli, and the action of GDF15 can be abrogated either by genetically ablating CCK neurons selectively in this region or by blocking CCK transmission. Thus, we propose that the primary target for GDF15 is a distinct population of GFRAL/CCK neurons which span the AP/NTS to engage well-characterised circuitry involved in anorexia and conditioned aversion (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib56">Wu et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Carter et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Chen et al., 2018</xref>). We have found that CCK neurons activated by GDF15 project directly to the PBN, and that other downstream targets, in the PVH, CeA and ovBNST are also involved. There is ample evidence for anorectic signals to utilise parallel downstream pathways, but with convergence at specific nodes which we demonstrate are activated by GDF15, including CGRP neurons in the PBN (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">D'Agostino et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib45">Roman et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib46">Roman et al., 2017</xref>) and/or PKC-δ<sup>+</sup> neurons in both the CeA and ovBNST (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Cai et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib54">Wang et al., 2019</xref>). There is still much to learn about these pathways, not least because we have shown that GFRAL neurons are not activated by the archetypal nausea-inducing agent LiCl, nor does GDF15 activate PPG (here) or GLP-1 receptor neurons (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib55">Welsh et al., 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Frikke-Schmidt et al., 2019</xref>), both capable of transmitting nauseous signals. Recently, bacterial or viral infections have been associated with secretion of GDF15 and an adaptive response in order to increase pathogen tolerance (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">Luan et al., 2019</xref>). In this ground-breaking paper, it was demonstrated that GDF15/GFRAL signalling increases triglyceride production by the liver in order to protect tissues, which are dependent on triglycerides for fuel, from metabolic damage due to inflammation. Also, the loss of appetite and weight caused by metformin in diet-induced obese mice is dependent on GDF15/GFRAL signalling, as is the accompanying increase in insulin sensitivity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Coll et al., 2020</xref>).</p><p>It is interesting to note that increased GDF15 has been measured in the circulation of human cancer subjects (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib55">Welsh et al., 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Bauskin et al., 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Brown et al., 2003</xref>) and, recently an NTS → CGRP<sup>PBN</sup> → CeA/ovBNST axis has been implicated in mediating the anorexia associated with cancer models in mice (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Campos et al., 2017</xref>). Likewise, work in rats has demonstrated that this pathway appears also to be activated by the platinum-based, cancer therapeutic drug, cisplatin (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Alhadeff et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Alhadeff et al., 2017</xref>). Although in neither case has the primary brainstem neuron been identified (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Hsu et al., 2017</xref>), it is reported that weight loss caused by cisplatin is reduced in GFRAL knock-out mice, and we now show that this is true also if wild-type mice are pre-treated with a neutralising GFRAL antibody. Although it is yet to be verified, the possibility exists that both a disease state (cancer) and the treatment (cisplatin) may exacerbate anorexia through the same brainstem pathway. If this is the case, then either GFRAL neutralising antibodies or GFRAL antagonists may provide a possible co-treatment opportunity for patients suffering with cancer-related anorexia/cachexia. The caveat to this is that the secretion of GDF15 during cancer, as it appears so for inflammatory infections, is presumably an adaptive response, so blocking GDF15/GFRAL signalling may worsen the disease and other symptoms. GDF15 has been located in different tissues when they become cancerous (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib55">Welsh et al., 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Buckhaults et al., 2003</xref>). If GDF15 has an adaptive systemic effect, then it may be possible to bypass this and, instead, selectively target the central pathways downstream of brainstem GFRAL.</p></sec><sec id="s4" sec-type="materials|methods"><title>Materials and methods</title><table-wrap id="keyresource" position="anchor"><label>Key resources table</label><table frame="hsides" rules="groups"><thead><tr><th>Reagent type <break/>(species) or resource</th><th>Designation</th><th>Source or reference</th><th>Identifiers</th><th>Additional <break/>information</th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td>Genetic reagent (<italic>Mus musculus</italic>)</td><td>C57Bl/6J <break/>(Mouse, male)</td><td>Envigo</td><td>Stock #057</td><td>MGI:2164189</td></tr><tr><td>Genetic reagent (<italic>Mus musculus</italic>)</td><td>C57Bl/6NHsd <break/>(Mouse, male)</td><td>Envigo</td><td>Stock #044</td><td>MGI:2161078</td></tr><tr><td>Genetic reagent <break/>(<italic>M. musculus</italic>)</td><td>C57Bl/6J <break/>(Mouse, male)</td><td>Charles River</td><td>Stock #632</td><td>MGI:3028467</td></tr><tr><td>Genetic reagent <break/>(<italic>M. musculus</italic>)</td><td>C57Bl/6J <break/>(Mouse, male)</td><td>Janvier labs</td><td>N/A</td><td>MGI:2670020</td></tr><tr><td>Genetic reagent <break/>(<italic>M. musculus</italic>)</td><td><italic>Pomc</italic><sup>eGFP</sup> <break/>(Mouse, male)</td><td>Jackson Laboratories</td><td>Stock #: 009593</td><td>MGI:3851684</td></tr><tr><td>Genetic reagent <break/>(<italic>M. musculus</italic>)</td><td><italic>Cck</italic><sup>ires-Cre</sup> <break/>(Mouse, male)</td><td>Jackson Laboratories</td><td>Stock #: 012706</td><td>MGI:5014249</td></tr><tr><td>Genetic reagent <break/>(<italic>M. musculus</italic>)</td><td><italic>Crh</italic><sup>ires-Cre</sup> <break/>(Mouse, male)</td><td>Jackson Laboratories</td><td>Stock #: 012704</td><td>MGI:4452101</td></tr><tr><td>Genetic reagent <break/>(<italic>M. musculus</italic>)</td><td><italic>Slc17a6</italic><sup>ires-Cre</sup> <break/>(Mouse, male)</td><td>Jackson Laboratories</td><td>Stock #: 016963</td><td>MGI:5300532</td></tr><tr><td>Genetic reagent <break/>(<italic>M. musculus</italic>)</td><td>Rosa26-loxSTOPlox-eYFP (Mouse, male)</td><td>Jackson Laboratories</td><td>Stock #: 006148</td><td>MGI:3621481</td></tr><tr><td>Genetic reagent <break/>(<italic>M. musculus</italic>)</td><td><italic>Gcg</italic><sup>iCre</sup> <break/>(Mouse, male)</td><td><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib40">Parker et al., 2012</xref> PMID:<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/22638549">22638549</ext-link></td><td>N/A</td><td>MGI:5432481</td></tr><tr><td>Genetic reagent <break/>(<italic>M. musculus</italic>)</td><td><italic>Prlh</italic><sup>ires-Cre</sup> <break/>(Mouse, male)</td><td><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Dodd et al., 2014</xref> PMID:<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/25176149">25176149</ext-link></td><td>N/A</td><td>MGI:5634277</td></tr><tr><td>Genetic reagent <break/>(<italic>M. musculus</italic>)</td><td><italic>Calca<sup>Cre</sup></italic> <break/>(Mouse, male)</td><td><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Carter et al., 2013</xref> PMID:<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24121436">24121436</ext-link></td><td>N/A</td><td>MGI:5559692</td></tr><tr><td>Genetic reagent (Rattus norvegicus)</td><td>Sprague Dawley (Rat, male)</td><td>Envigo</td><td>Stock #: SD-002</td><td>N/A</td></tr><tr><td>Antibody</td><td>anti-cFos (Rabbit polyclonal)</td><td>Santa Cruz</td><td>Cat.# SC52 <break/>RRID:<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://scicrunch.org/resolver/AB_2106783">AB_2106783</ext-link></td><td>Primary antibody (1:500) IHC</td></tr><tr><td>Antibody</td><td>anti-DS Red (Goat polyclonal)</td><td>Santa Cruz</td><td>Cat.# 33353 <break/>RRID:<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://scicrunch.org/resolver/AB_639924">AB_639924</ext-link></td><td>Primary antibody (1:500) IHC</td></tr><tr><td>Antibody</td><td>anti-GFP (Chicken polyclonal)</td><td>Abcam</td><td>Cat.# 13970 <break/>RRID:<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://scicrunch.org/resolver/AB_300798">AB_300798</ext-link></td><td>Primary antibody (1:2000) IHC</td></tr><tr><td>Antibody</td><td>anti-GFRAL <break/>(Sheep polyclonal)</td><td>Thermofisher</td><td>Cat.# PA5-47769 <break/>RRID:<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://scicrunch.org/resolver/AB_2607220">AB_2607220</ext-link></td><td>Primary antibody (1:200) IHC</td></tr><tr><td>Antibody</td><td>anti-GLP1 (Rabbit polyclonal)</td><td>PenLabs</td><td>Cat.#.

Food intake and body weight were monitored daily. At 24, 48, and 72 hr, n = 6 mice from each group were sacrificed with CO<sub>2</sub> inhalation and blood was collected with cardiac puncture. Plasma was taken with Approtinin and DPP4 inhibitors. GDF15 levels are measured using a mouse specific ELISA, according to manufacturer’s directions (R and D Systems, MGD150). A dose-finding experiment for GFRAL mAb (mIgG1 GFRAL 8A2, Lilly Indianapolis, USA) was performed. Briefly, 1 day prior to GDF15 administration at 4 nmol/kg for 3 consecutive days, the mice were subcutaneously dosed once either with control antibody (mIgG1 antibody, Lilly Indianapolis) at 10 mg/kg or ascending doses of antibody at 0.3, 1, 3 and 10 mg/kg of GFRAL mAb. Daily food intake and body weight were measured for three days. In a different experiment, control antibody or GFRAL mAb (both 10 mg/kg) were subcutaneously dosed once 1 day prior to intraperitoneal dose of cisplatin at 4 mg/kg.</p></sec><sec id="s4-5"><title>Conditioned taste and place aversion tests, pica behaviour</title><p>For conditioned taste aversion, C57Bl/6J mice were housed in cages that permitted ad libitum access to water from two bottles, side-by-side, for at least 1 week before the experiment. On day 1 of the study, animals were water deprived overnight for 16.5 hr. The following morning (day 2), water-deprived animals were provided with two bottles of a novel 15% sucrose solution (dissolved in drinking water) for 30 min. At the end of the 30 min sucrose exposure, animals received an s.c. injection of either saline or GDF15 (4 nmol/kg, 4 ml/kg; n = 6 per group). Two water bottles were returned immediately and mice had unlimited access to water for one night. On day 3, mice were again water deprived overnight. On day 4, water-deprived animals were provided with one bottle of 15% sucrose and one bottle of water for a period of 24 hr. Volumes of sucrose and water intake were measured at 2 hr and 24 hr and used to calculate sucrose preference (sucrose intake/total fluid intake * 100). Food was available ad libitum throughout the study. The positioning of the sucrose and water bottles (left or right) was randomised within treatment groups.</p><p>Conditioned place aversion was performed using an apparatus composed of two chambers with distinct visual and tactile qualities, connected by a brightly lit corridor (Harvard Biosciences/Biochrom Ltd., Cambridge, UK). The darker chamber consisted of a rough black floor and black spotted walls, whereas the lighter chamber consisted of a smooth grey floor and grey striped walls. Time spent in each chamber was monitored by video cameras mounted directly above the apparatus, connected to a computer running tracking software (Smart v3.0, Panlab, Harvard Biosciences/Biochrom Ltd.). All procedures were carried out between three and five hours after lights on. On day 1, C57Bl/6J mice (n = 12) were given free access to the full apparatus and allowed to freely explore both chambers for 30 min. Their initial pre-test preference was calculated from the time spent in each chamber. A biased design was used, whereby GDF15 was associated with the most-preferred chamber, which was the darker chamber for all mice. On days 2 and 3, a conditioning session was performed, where mice were restricted to one chamber following administration of either GDF15 (4 nmol/kg, injected s.c. on day 2) or saline (0.9% NaCl injected s.c. on day 3). Following each injection, mice were returned to their home cage for 10 min and then placed in the relevant chamber for 30 min. On day 4, a test session was performed in identical fashion to day 1, and their post-conditioning preference was calculated from the time spent in each chamber. Food and water was available ad libitum throughout the study, except for when mice were in the conditioning apparatus.</p><p>To measure pica behaviour, male Sprague-Dawley rats (Envigo, Indianapolis, IN) were acclimated with kaolin pellets available ad libitum in a hopper placed continuously in the home cage. Rats were assigned randomly to three groups (n = 9–10 per group) and treated on 3 consecutive days with vehicle (acetate buffer, pH 5.5, 1 ml/kg, s.c.), human recombinant GDF15 (0.2 mg/kg, s.c.) or LiCl (0.3 M in water, 1% body weight, equivalent to 128 mg/kg, i.p.). Body weight, chow and kaolin intake were determined daily.</p></sec><sec id="s4-6"><title>Statistics</title><p>Statistical analyses were performed using Prism 7 (Graphpad Software, La Jolla, CA).

consequences. The authors of this paper reveal that the cytokine GDF-15 is produced in response to the cancer drug, cisplatin and that it induces anorexia by activating cells in the hindbrain that express cholecystokinin and the GDF-15 receptor. Blockade of GDF-15 receptor or CCK signaling ameliorates the anorexic effect of cisplatin.</p><p><bold>Decision letter after peer review:</bold></p><p>Thank you for submitting your article &quot;The cytokine GDF15 signals through a population of brainstem cholecystokinin neurons to mediate anorectic signalling&quot; for consideration by <italic>eLife</italic>. Your article has been reviewed by three peer reviewers, including Richard D Palmiter as the Reviewing Editor and Reviewer #1, and the evaluation has been overseen by Catherine Dulac as the Senior Editor. The following individual involved in review of your submission has agreed to reveal their identity: Marcelo O Dietrich (Reviewer #3).</p><p>The reviewers have discussed the reviews with one another and the Reviewing Editor has drafted this decision to help you prepare a revised submission.</p><p>The role of GDF15 and its receptor GFRAL in signaling peripheral threats is an exciting advance in the field of interoceptive signaling. Understanding how the GFRAL-expressing neurons in the AP/NTS signal to other brain regions is important. Characterizing the signaling molecules made by GFRAL neurons and their relevant post-synaptic targets is critical to this endeavor.</p><p>The reviewers are pleased with the overall thrust of the experiments described in this paper. The manuscript includes some important observations, but many details are missing (see below). Consequently, we are not sure whether your team can address these issues in a timely manner (2 months). If not, you may prefer to withdraw the paper now and submit it as a new paper when you have more definitive data.</p><p>The major concerns that need to be addressed are as follows:</p><p>1) The molecular identity of only about half of the GFRAL neurons was determined. What is the molecular identity of the other half? What fast transmitters do GFRAL neurons use, if any? Single-cell RNA-Seq is one way to answer these questions but is probably not feasible in 2 months unless the authors have already initiated this approach.</p><p>2) Addressing the identity of GFRAL post-synaptic neurons that mediate anorexia or other phenotypes is one of the goals of this study. GDF15 activates Fos in parabrachial CGRP neurons, in agreement with previous results, suggesting that GFRAL (CCK subtype) neurons may directly innervate CGRP neurons; however, experiments should be included that reveal whether the signaling is direct or indirect. Is the projection to the PBN the only one that mediates anorexia in response to GFRAL neuron activation?</p><p>3) The observation that CCK neurons and CCK itself are an important contributor to the anorexic phenotype is an interesting observation. If the GFRAL/CCK neurons are glutamatergic, it is surprising that CCK is so important. Experiments showing the CCK action in the PBN is important and determining which CCK receptors are involved are needed to solidify this interesting observation.</p><p>4) Does CCK ablation in AP/NTS have long-term effects on food intake or body weight. Perhaps this experiment has already been published. If so, provide a reference.</p><p>5) The conditioned place aversion experiment needs clarification. The authors say that testing was the same as day one, i.e. 30-min (1800-s) session. But Figure 2D shows only ~500 s on the preferred side which is less than half of the total time. Pairing GDF15 with the preferred side decreased that time to about 250 seconds suggesting that it is aversive. One problem is that &quot;CPA score&quot; is never defined.</p><p>6) The number of mice used for each experiment should be included in the figure legends.</p><p>The reviewers also have specific suggestions for improvement of this paper which can be found in the individual comments.</p><p><italic>Reviewer #1:</italic></p><p>The authors of this paper provide data demonstrating that GDF15 induces anorexia and nausea-like behavior in mice/rats and suggest that GDF15 is not a physiological regulator of satiety but rather a sickness signal. They also show that cisplatin stimulates GDF15 expression and the anorexia effect of this cancer-treatment drug depends on GFRAL. Many of the experiments are similar to those recently published by some of the same authors in Cell Metabolism (2020, 31:1-12).</p><p>1) The strength of this paper is that the authors begin to characterize the signaling molecules expressed by GFRAL neurons and the neural circuits that they activate. Using a candidate-gene approach they provide evidence that about half of the GFRAL neurons express CCK and/or TH, but the remaining neurons remain unidentified. What fraction of the GFRAL neurons are glutamatergic? Using RNA-Seq of GFRAL-expressing neurons could identify the remaining GFRAL neurons and help elucidate whether GFRAL represents one or multiple populations of neurons.</p><p>2) The authors show that treatment with GDF15 induces Fos expression in CGRP neurons in the parabrachial nucleus (PBN) and this induction depends on CCK-expressing neurons (ablation study) and CCK (antagonist study). The implication of these studies is that CCK/GFRAL neurons project directly to CGRP-expressing neurons in the PBN and that CCK plays a significant role in the anorexia phenotype. It is a little surprising that CCK has such a large effect considering that the GFRAL/CCK neurons are probably also glutamatergic and may express other neuropeptides. Authors should determine whether CGRP neurons in the PBN express CCK receptors and whether they are type 1 and/or type 2 receptors. Demonstrating that CCK signaling in PBN is sufficient for the anorexia phenotype is also important.</p><p><italic>Reviewer #2:</italic></p><p>The manuscript by Beebe and colleagues investigates various aspects of GDF15 signaling and its receptor GFRAL within the brainstem that extends many previous findings about this cytokine system. This current study reports five main findings: (1) GFRAL-positive neurons in the AP and NTS partially overlap with CCK. (2) GDF produces negative affect, as measured by conditioned taste aversion, conditioned place aversion, and increased pica behavior. (3) GDF15 activates CCK neurons (as measured by Fos expression), as well as several downstream brain areas including the PBN and PVN. (4) Ablating CCK neurons in the brainstem or injecting mice with a global CCK antagonist attenuates the anorexigenic effects of GDF15. (5) GFRAL receptor blockade with a monoclonal antibody attenuates the adverse side effects of a cancer therapeutic drug, cisplatin.</p><p>Taken together, these results extend the findings of previous studies that reported the anorexigenic effects of GDF15 and the expression patterns of GFRAL in the brainstem. Many of the experiments in the study seem well done, however, some concerns dampen enthusiasm for this study.</p><p>1) The quantitative results of the Fos studies reported in Figure 1 and Supplementary Figure 1 are not sufficient to justify the conclusion that &quot;GFRAL-positive neurons in the AP and NTS co-localize with CCK.&quot; Indeed, the only quantification provided indicates that less than half (45%) of GFRAL cells co-localize with CCK. Could the authors provide a Table with exact measurements across many animals to fully report the quantitative details of these experiments? If 45% of GFRAL cells co-localize with CCK, then why does the Venn diagram in Supplementary Figure 1 imply that much more than 45% (looks like 2/3) co-localize? Is this Venn diagram based on data, or only a rough approximation? What is the percentage of CCK neurons that colocalize with GFRAL? The number of details missing in this analysis calls into question any major conclusion. Certainly, the claim that &quot;GFRAL is localized to CCK-positive neurons in the AP/NTS,&quot; as highlighted in the text, is not justified by the data.</p><p>2) Why is the Pica behavior performed in rats whereas all other experiments are performed in mice? Switching model organisms in the middle of a study seems odd. Wouldn't this experiment be relatively easy to perform in mice?</p><p>3) The title of one of the Results sections… &quot;The effects of GDF15 are mediated by CCK neurons&quot; is not actually demonstrated in this section. The section that follows reports the effects of GDF15 administration on Fos staining. One cannot conclude from these studies that the effects of GDF15 are mediated by CCK neurons. Ironically, this could be the conclusion of the following section, which demonstrates the necessity of CCK neural activity for GFF15-mediated anorexia.</p><p>4) Why do the authors study a loss of function of CCK neurons using two methods in Figure 4 (the Tobacco Etch Protease and CCK receptor antagonist), and then, when studying the effects of cisplatin, use a completely different method in Figure 5 (monoclonal antibody against GFRAL) to study GFRAL neurons instead of CCK neurons? This study is sometimes about CCK-expressing neurons and sometimes about GFRAL-expressing neurons, and some consistency across experiments would lend to better overall conclusions.</p><p>5) Does the ablation of CCK-expressing cells in the AP/NTS cause long-term changes in food intake behavior? The results in Figure 4 imply that ablation of these cells does not alter food intake, however, they prevent the anorexia caused by GDF15 administration. Could the authors make a larger conclusion about the fact that there is no result of CCK neuron ablation in the absence of GDF15 administration?</p><p>6) The histology results shown in Figure 5D are too small to discern.</p><p><italic>Reviewer #3:</italic></p><p>The paper provides novel insight into the population of brainstem neurons that express the receptor GFRAL for the cytokine GDF15 that is produced in pathological states and leads to anorexia and weight loss. In addition, they show data that suggest the effect of GDF15 to reduce food intake is in part mediated by CCK expressing neurons in the NTS and AP and by CCK signaling. Moreover, they show that GDF15 evoke conditioned taste and food aversion. These are important observations in a field of research that is rapidly expanding. Some concerns remain that would need to be addressed.</p><p>1) The animal models that have Cre-recombinase can have leaky Cre-expression. At the minimum, the authors should comment on the specificity of the Cre lines used for labeling the neuropeptidergic neurons studied.</p><p>2) The number of animals used in each experiment seems to be missing from all figures/experiments.</p><p>3) Given the importance of the anatomical characterizations of GFRAL neurons in the brainstem, it would be useful to include quantification of cells in Figure 1.</p><p>4) &quot;Together these data suggest that GDF15 is not a natural satiety factor…&quot;. At the moment this statement is not very convincing, and the experiments were not designed to generate this conclusion.</p><p>5) Conditioned place aversion (Figure 2D). I might have missed something here, which could be clarified in the text, however it seems that in both pre-test and test conditions animals still prefer the side of the chamber in which they received GDF15, instead of switching the preference to the saline side. Can the decrease in preference be considered as a place aversion, even though the animals still prefer the same side of the chamber?</p><p>6) Figure 5G: the reduction in food intake by cisplatin in the presence of control Ab seems to be small and only significant at day 2 (?) Clarify statistics and N. In Supplementary Figure 5A and B would be helpful to see the correlation between GDF15 and cumulative food intake and %BW in control mice injected saline.</p></body></sub-article><sub-article article-type="reply" id="sa2"><front-stub><article-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.55164.sa2</article-id><title-group><article-title>Author response</article-title></title-group></front-stub><body><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>The major concerns that need to be addressed are as follows:</p><p>1) The molecular identity of only about half of the GFRAL neurons was determined.

We carried out some RNAScope in situ hybridisation, to further analyse the relationship between GFRAL and CCK. This showed that 69 ± 2 % of GFRAL neurons in the area postrema contain <italic>Cck</italic> mRNA, though the proportion of double-labelled cells is lower in the NTS (35 ± 4 %). As 46 ± 2 % of CCK neurons in the AP contain GFRAL, this represents a significant population.

This fits with the consensus that CCK neurons in the brainstem are glutamatergic. Thus, we feel that this is ample evidence to confirm that GFRAL cells are predominantly CCK-ergic and have reworded the manuscript accordingly.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>2) Addressing the identity of GFRAL post-synaptic neurons that mediate anorexia or other phenotypes is one of the goals of this study.

Is the projection to the PBN the only one that mediates anorexia in response to GFRAL neuron activation?</p></disp-quote><p>We do not have a <italic>Gfral</italic>-cre mouse available. However, Roman et al., 2016, have demonstrated, using channel rhodopsin-assisted mapping, that CCK<sup>NTS</sup> neurons project directly to CGRP<sup>PBN</sup> cells. We will cite this paper explicitly on this point. Bearing in mind the limitations of tracing techniques, we have shown that the majority of CCK/GFRAL<sup>NTS</sup> and CCK/GFRAL<sup>AP</sup> neurons, which are activated by GDF15, project to the PBN and not to other identified, presumably transynaptically activated areas. Furthermore, when we ablate these PBN-projecting CCK neurons, the anorectic response to GDF15 is lost. Importantly, 59% of CCK neurons activated by GDF15 are in the AP, whereas only 11% are in the NTS. Unfortunately, it will be difficult to separate accurately the NTS and AP GFRAL populations with AAV injections, since they span the nuclei. In the manuscript, we have also tried to highlight the population of unidentified, GDF15-activated neurons in the NTS. These too may be dependent on CCK input.</p><p>It may be possible to establish the role of CGRP<sup>PBN</sup> neurons in the response to GDF15, using <italic>Calca</italic>-cre mice, that can be injected with a cre-dependent AAV-caspase. However, due to Covid lockdown, we cannot initiate this experiment. We have tried to be clear that, while some of the neurons activated in the PBN contain <italic>Calca</italic>-cre, not all of them do. Therefore, we are not convinced that we would necessarily block the whole effect of GDF15 by inactivating CGRP neurons (see point below also). We have re-written the paragraph to make it clear that some of the activated neurons in the PBN contain CGRP, and so these are one downstream target.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>3) The observation that CCK neurons and CCK itself are an important contributor to the anorexic phenotype is an interesting observation. If the GFRAL/CCK neurons are glutamatergic, it is surprising that CCK is so important. Experiments showing the CCK action in the PBN is important and determining which CCK receptors are involved are needed to solidify this interesting observation.</p></disp-quote><p>This relates to the point above. We are reliant on the <italic>Calca</italic>-cre mouse injected with AAV-mCherry for identification of CGRP<sup>PBN</sup> neurons. Although we, and some others, have attempted immunostaining for native CGRP and CCK1R, the results are not reliable and we would not trust interpretation based on this methodology. Thus, we also have performed dual label in situ hybridisation histology for <italic>Calca</italic> and <italic>Cckr1</italic>, which clearly shows a small proportion of CGRP neurons contain <italic>Cckr1</italic> mRNA.</p><p>Roman et al., 2016, showed that the immediate electrical response to stimulation of CCK<sup>NTS</sup> neurons can be blocked with glutamate antagonists. Although establishing that input, it does not rule out an effect of CCK on the functioning of CGRP<sup>PBN</sup> or other PBN cells. Our results demonstrate that about half of the acute effects of GDF15 are dependent on CCK receptor signalling. We have rewritten the section to incorporate our new findings and to put the size of the effect of the antagonist into context. We agree that the effect of the CCK antagonist is significant, and we cannot discount an important role for synaptically activated cells in the NTS (a region which also contains CCKR1). We are keen to investigate this signalling pathway further, but cannot because of Covid restrictions.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>4) Does CCK ablation in AP/NTS have long-term effects on food intake or body weight. Perhaps this experiment has already been published. If so, provide a reference.</p></disp-quote><p>To our knowledge, the long-term effects of ablating CCK neurons has not been published. Across the time frame we have studied in our mice, we have not seen any obvious changes in body weight. This has now been included in Figure 4—figure supplement 1.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>5) The conditioned place aversion experiment needs clarification.

One problem is that &quot;CPA score&quot; is never defined.</p></disp-quote><p>Thank you for this observation. We have not made this point clear, but there is an adjoining “corridor” between the two chambers, permitting “unforced choice.” This is considered good practice in any form of place conditioning, as described by Prus et al., (2009; PMID: 21204336). As the mice are free to explore three areas, the figures do not appear to add up. Thus, we have re-graphed the results to show the absolute time spent in the GDF15-paired chamber, which we hope is more clear. We will clarify this in the text and removed reference to the CPA score.

The implication of these studies is that CCK/GFRAL neurons project directly to CGRP-expressing neurons in the PBN and that CCK plays a significant role in the anorexia phenotype. It is a little surprising that CCK has such a large effect considering that the GFRAL/CCK neurons are probably also glutamatergic and may express other neuropeptides. Authors should determine whether CGRP neurons in the PBN express CCK receptors and whether they are type 1 and/or type 2 receptors. Demonstrating that CCK signaling in PBN is sufficient for the anorexia phenotype is also important.</p></disp-quote><p>We have now shown that a proportion of CGRP<sup>PBN</sup> neurons contain <italic>Cckr1</italic> mRNA and have stated clearly that there may be other GFRAL targets in the PBN. We have pointed out that about half of the acute anorectic effect of GDF15 is blocked by the CCK receptor antagonist. Importantly, we reiterate that GFRAL neurons appear to activate unidentified neurons in the both the PBN and in the NTS.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Reviewer #2:</p><p>[…] 1) The quantitative results of the Fos studies reported in Figure 1 and Supplementary Figure 1 are not sufficient to justify the conclusion that &quot;GFRAL-positive neurons in the AP and NTS co-localize with CCK.&quot; Indeed, the only quantification provided indicates that less than half (45%) of GFRAL cells co-localize with CCK. Could the authors provide a Table with exact measurements across many animals to fully report the quantitative details of these experiments?</p></disp-quote><p>We now have provided the exact measurements in a supplementary table (Supplementary file 1). This includes new data from the RNAScope study, which indicates a higher co-localisation.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>If 45% of GFRAL cells co-localize with CCK, then why does the Venn diagram in Supplementary Figure 1 imply that much more than 45% (looks like 2/3) co-localize? Is this Venn diagram based on data, or only a rough approximation? What is the percentage of CCK neurons that colocalize with GFRAL? The number of details missing in this analysis calls into question any major conclusion. Certainly, the claim that &quot;GFRAL is localized to CCK-positive neurons in the AP/NTS,&quot; as highlighted in the text, is not justified by the data.</p></disp-quote><p>We have now dealt with this by carrying out dual-label RNAScope (see comments to editors). This clearly shows that a majority of <italic>Gfral</italic>-containing neurons also contain <italic>Cck</italic> mRNA. Likewise, 46 % of <italic>Cck</italic> neurons in the AP contain <italic>Gfral</italic>. These data, along with additional quantification of co-localisation of <italic>VGlut</italic> and TH in GFRAL neurons has also been included in the supplementary table (Supplementary file 1). Although we had stated that the Venn diagram was only a rough representation, we agree that it does not portray our results accurately, so we have now omitted it from the manuscript.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>2) Why is the Pica behavior performed in rats whereas all other experiments are performed in mice? Switching model organisms in the middle of a study seems odd. Wouldn't this experiment be relatively easy to perform in mice?</p></disp-quote><p>Pica behaviour is notoriously difficult to perform in mice as they have a tendency to gnaw at kaolin and spread the powder liberally around their cages, making accurate weighing almost impossible. We think that adding data from another species adds value, but we decided only to include the figure as supplementary material.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>3) The title of one of the Results sections &quot;The effects of GDF15 are mediated by CCK neurons&quot; is not actually demonstrated in this section. The section that follows reports the effects of GDF15 administration on Fos staining. One cannot conclude from these studies that the effects of GDF15 are mediated by CCK neurons. Ironically, this could be the conclusion of the following section, which demonstrates the necessity of CCK neural activity for GFF15-mediated anorexia.</p></disp-quote><p>Strictly true, but as we have now shown GFRAL is expressed mostly in CCK neurons, it is a fair assumption. That said, we have altered the sub-section title to “GDF15 activates CCK<sup>AP/NTS</sup> neurons.”</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>4) Why do the authors study a loss of function of CCK neurons using two methods in Figure 4 (the Tobacco Etch Protease and CCK receptor antagonist), and then, when studying the effects of cisplatin, use a completely different method in Figure 5 (monoclonal antibody against GFRAL) to study GFRAL neurons instead of CCK neurons? This study is sometimes about CCK-expressing neurons and sometimes about GFRAL-expressing neurons, and some consistency across experiments would lend to better overall conclusions.</p></disp-quote><p>With respect, the reviewer will not have seen our additional results, which shows the high overlap between GFRAL and CCK neurons. Thus, we are then trying to study the relevance of that cell mediator in different ways. We believe that providing evidence using different methods can add strength to the argument. Caspase will kill <italic>Cck</italic><sup>Cre</sup> neurons, importantly including GFRAL-expressing CCK neurons, as we have verified in <italic>post mortem</italic> cell counts (Figure 4—figure supplement 1). CCK neurons in the brainstem are glutamatergic and may contain other transmitters. Therefore, we wanted to assess the role of CCK itself (as opposed to other transmitters) in mediating the effects of GDF15, and so used a receptor antagonist. The last section of the paper addresses a separate question of whether the GFRAL receptor can be targeted in translational research. The GFRAL receptor antibody is an excellent tool to provide useful data, as an antagonist is not available.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>5) Does the ablation of CCK-expressing cells in the AP/NTS cause long-term changes in food intake behavior? The results in Figure 4 imply that ablation of these cells does not alter food intake, however, they prevent the anorexia caused by GDF15 administration. Could the authors make a larger conclusion about the fact that there is no result of CCK neuron ablation in the absence of GDF15 administration?</p></disp-quote><p>To our knowledge, the long-term effects of ablating CCK neurons has not been published. Across the time frame we have studied in our mice, we have not seen any obvious changes in body weight. This has now been included as Figure 4—figure supplement 1. We are not in a position to speculate whether CCK neurons have a homeostatic role, as our experiments have not been designed specifically to answer such a question.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>6) The histology results shown in Figure 5D are too small to discern.</p></disp-quote><p>We have remade this figure.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Reviewer #3:</p><p>[…] 1) The animal models that have Cre-recombinase can have leaky Cre-expression. At the minimum, the authors should comment on the specificity of the Cre lines used for labeling the neuropeptidergic neurons studied.</p></disp-quote><p>References are provided in the Materials and methods section for all the mouse lines used, which demonstrate that each produces a true representation of endogenous gene expression. It is known that both the <italic>Cck</italic><sup>Cre</sup> and <italic>Calca</italic><sup>Cre</sup> lines may report on more cells than express the gene in adult mice; suggesting that more cells may express significant levels of these genes during development. This is a fair point regarding the initial section, where we used a candidate-gene approach and transgenic mouse lines. However, we have now followed this up with dual-label RNAScope in adult mice, which shows a good consensus. For the experiment using <italic>Calca</italic><sup>Cre</sup>, there is not an issue, since adult mice were injected with a viral reporter.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>2) The number of animals used in each experiment seems to be missing from all figures/experiments.</p></disp-quote><p>Numbers have been included</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>3) Given the importance of the anatomical characterizations of GFRAL neurons in the brainstem, it would be useful to include quantification of cells in Figure 1.</p></disp-quote><p>Quantification has been added in the new supplementary table (Supplementary file 1).</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>4) &quot;Together these data suggest that GDF15 is not a natural satiety factor…&quot;. At the moment this statement is not very convincing, and the experiments were not designed to generate this conclusion.</p></disp-quote><p>We have added reference to the recent publications and tempered the sentence by saying “Together, these and recently published data (Borner et al., 2020 two papers) suggest that GDF15 is probably not a satiety factor.” The following sentence in our manuscript also provides another four references which contain additional supporting evidence for this statement. In this manuscript we go on to show that GFRAL neurons are only activated by stimuli which cause gastric malaise, and not by stimuli that induce normal satiety. We also show that treatment of mice with the GFRAL monoclonal antibody itself does not affect feeding or body weight, but does block anorexia caused by a drug that causes gastric malaise.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>5) Conditioned place aversion (Figure 2D). I might have missed something here, which could be clarified in the text, however it seems that in both pre-test and test conditions animals still prefer the side of the chamber in which they received GDF15, instead of switching the preference to the saline side. Can the decrease in preference be considered as a place aversion, even though the animals still prefer the same side of the chamber?</p></disp-quote><p>Thank you for this observation, as we can see how confusing this is. It highlights the issue of using a CPA “score” to denote aversion. As done by others, CPA was calculated by [time in chamber A] minus [time in chamber B] and, therefore, represents the <italic>difference</italic> in time spent between chambers, not the absolute time spent in each chamber. This calculation is often used in CPP/CPA experiments to account for the inherent preference of mice to one-side of a two-chamber apparatus and normalises this preference when there is a difference in separate treatment groups (which is not an issue here). Our study is further complicated by the fact that we have an adjoining corridor between two chambers, permitting unforced choice (as described by Prus and colleagues, PMID 21204336), but giving the mice three areas to explore.</p><p>We accept that the CPA score is misleading and perhaps not appropriate here. Therefore, we have changed Figure 2C to depict time spent in the GDF15-paired chamber and have described explicitly both our apparatus and analysis in the Materials and methods section.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>6) Figure 5G: the reduction in food intake by cisplatin in the presence of control Ab seems to be small and only significant at day 2 (?) Clarify statistics and N. In Supplementary Figure 5A and B would be helpful to see the correlation between GDF15 and cumulative food intake and %BW in control mice injected saline.</p></disp-quote><p>Thank you for this comment. We agree that the result for day 1 looks small; this is because the first injection of cisplatin is given on day 2. We have altered the axis in the Figure 5G to reflect this (i.e. daily not cumulative food intake). Stats and N are now clear in the legend. We have included the correlation analysis for mice injected with control in Figure 5—figure supplement 1.</p></body></sub-article></article>
