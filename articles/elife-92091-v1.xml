Some non-mammalian vertebrates show robust regeneration, via Muller glia (MG). We have recently made significant progress in stimulating adult mouse MG to regenerate functional neurons by transgenic expression of the proneural transcription factor Ascl1. While these results showed that MG can serve as an endogenous source of neuronal replacement, the efficacy of this process is limited. With the goal of improving this in mammals, we designed a small molecule screen using sci-Plex, a method to multiplex up to thousands of single-nucleus RNA-seq conditions into a single experiment. We used this technology to screen a library of 92 compounds, identified, and validated two that promote neurogenesis in vivo. Our results demonstrate that high-throughput single-cell molecular profiling can substantially improve the discovery process for molecules and pathways that can stimulate neural regeneration and further demonstrate the potential for this approach to restore vision in patients with retinal disease.</p></abstract><kwd-group kwd-group-type="author-keywords"><kwd>single-cell sequencing</kwd><kwd>retina</kwd><kwd>reprogramming</kwd><kwd>neuron</kwd><kwd>cell signaling</kwd></kwd-group><kwd-group kwd-group-type="research-organism"><title>Research organism</title><kwd>Mouse</kwd></kwd-group><funding-group><award-group id="fund1"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000053</institution-id><institution>National Eye Institute</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>R01EY021482-12</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Reh</surname><given-names>Thomas A</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund2"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000053</institution-id><institution>National Eye Institute</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>K99EY033402</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Todd</surname><given-names>Levi</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund3"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000053</institution-id><institution>National Eye Institute</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>1F32EY032331</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Tresenrider</surname><given-names>Amy</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund4"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100001116</institution-id><institution>Foundation Fighting Blindness</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>TA-RM-0620-0788-UWA</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Reh</surname><given-names>Thomas A</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund5"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100014989</institution-id><institution>Chan Zuckerberg Initiative</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>CZF2019-002442</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Trapnell</surname><given-names>Cole</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund6"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100013779</institution-id><institution>International Retina Research Foundation</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>Fellowship</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Hooper</surname><given-names>Marcus</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund7"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000051</institution-id><institution>National Human Genome Research Institute</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>1R01HG010632</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Trapnell</surname><given-names>Cole</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund8"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000952</institution-id><institution>Paul G.

In contrast, many non-mammalian vertebrates can replace lost neurons via neurogenic reprogramming of non-neuronal cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib52">Todd and Reh, 2022</xref>). Efforts to stimulate neural cell replacement in mammals, akin to what occurs in regenerative species, have been met with some success (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Jorstad et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">Lentini et al., 2021</xref>). These approaches are typically focused on using transcription factors (TFs) to reprogram glial cells into neurogenic precursors in contexts across the CNS (brain, retina, and spinal cord). However, the reprogramming is incomplete, affecting only a subset of cells or producing cells without mature neuronal markers. Given the vast array of small molecules and biologics available, there is potential to screen for factors that improve such gene therapy techniques. Scalable methods capable of screening an increased number of reprogramming treatments have the potential to uncover factors that improve the regenerative potential of the mammalian CNS. These efforts may lead to future cell-replacement therapeutics.</p><p>We have recently developed methods to stimulate the regeneration of neurons from Muller glia (MG) in the mammalian retina in vitro and in vivo (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Jorstad et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib42">Pollak et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Jorstad et al., 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib50">Todd et al., 2021</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib51">Todd et al., 2022</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib55">Ueki et al., 2015</xref>). The in vitro viral overexpression of Ascl1 in primary MG is able to reprogram glia from young mice to acquire a neurogenic progenitor state and generate neurons (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib42">Pollak et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">GascÃ³n et al., 2016</xref>), and similar results have been obtained with brain astrocytes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib42">Pollak et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">GascÃ³n et al., 2016</xref>). Ascl1 can also stimulate a neurogenic state in MG in vivo using a transgenic mouse line that targets this TF specifically to MG. When these mice are subjected to retinal injury using a neurotoxic dose of NMDA (N-methyl-D-aspartate) and subsequently treated with histone deacetylase (HDAC) inhibitors, the MG regenerate functional neurons in adult mice (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Jorstad et al., 2017</xref>). Follow-up studies combining Ascl1 with other TFs have proven useful in stimulating glia to regenerate alternate arrays of neuronal fates (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib50">Todd et al., 2021</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib51">Todd et al., 2022</xref>). These findings have established glia as a promising source for new neurons that could potentially be used to treat neurodegenerative disorders; however, the efficacy of neurogenesis is often too low to provide enough cells for functional recovery. Several studies have shown that cell signaling molecules can also affect the process of reprogramming cell fates, and investigators have suggested that small molecules might be useful in optimizing this approach for clinical applications of neural repair in combination or separate from TF overexpression (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Jorstad et al., 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">GascÃ³n et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Janowska et al., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Cheng et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Gao et al., 2017</xref>).</p><p>To identify additional compounds that aid in the reprogramming process and further stimulate neurogenesis from MG-derived progenitors, we set forth to design an assay that could scale the number of small molecules tested in a given in vitro experiment. Several limitations had made such plate-based screening difficult in the past: (1) screening was performed using marker genes and required the design of specific mice or cell lines to detect the emergence of only a single-cell type; (2) MG are not a large population of cells in the retina of young mice, thus the starting material is limited; and (3) current imaging-based methods to quantify the reprogramming outcome are low throughput. While traditional single-cell sequencing methods enable the molecular characterization of all cell types in a culture using low cell input without the need for marker genes, they are too costly for most labs to perform for more than a handful of samples. sci-Plex, a combinatorial indexing-based technology, scales the number of samples within a given single-cell sequencing experiment to up to thousands of samples, overcoming such limitations (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib45">Srivatsan et al., 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib45">Srivatsan et al., 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Cao et al., 2017</xref>). However, current applications of sci-Plex have been performed in combination with the high-throughput sci-RNA-seq3 protocol using culturing systems or organisms in which cell number is not limited (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib45">Srivatsan et al., 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib44">Saunders et al., 2022</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Dorrity et al., 2022</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib53">Tresenrider et al., 2023</xref>). Here, we demonstrate that sci-Plex is also compatible with lower input samples in combination with the sci-RNA-seq2 protocol which requires a lower cell input and has a higher cell recovery rate. Our application of sci-Plex to reprogramming MG is the first demonstration of sci-Plexâs utility for screening chemical compounds in a low abundance primary cell type with disease relevance. To examine and validate the utility of sci-Plex for this purpose, we applied sci-Plex to MG exposed to Ascl1 overexpression for different timings and durations. We saw that, increasing the length of Ascl1 exposure increased the number of neurons produced, and we uncovered molecular features associated with progression toward the neuronal fate. When we applied sci-Plex to a small molecule screen for factors associated with stem cell biology, we uncovered compounds that had effects on neurogenesis and total cell recovery. Several of the most effective compounds identified in vitro were further tested in vivo in a reprogramming assay where Ascl1 is over-expressed specifically in MG (i.e. ANT protocol). The results of this secondary in vivo screen identified two compounds that significantly enhanced neurogenesis in adult mouse retina.</p></sec><sec id="s2" sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><sec id="s2-1"><title>sci-Plex captures the in vitro temporal dynamics of neurogenic reprogramming from MG</title><p>We first aimed to assess the ability of sci-Plex to assign cells to specific wells in an expected manner by observing the in vitro kinetics and dynamic gene expression program of Ascl1-dependent MG reprogramming. Retinas were isolated from P11 mice expressing a constitutive rtTA driving a tet-inducible Ascl1-GFP. The retinas were dissociated and grown as previously described to enrich for MG (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib42">Pollak et al., 2013</xref>). We have previously shown that induction of Ascl1, by addition of doxycycline to the medium, induces neurogenesis in the MG, and that the new neurons generated from the reprogrammed MG most closely resemble bipolar neurons (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib42">Pollak et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1A</xref>). Taking advantage of the ease by which condition number can be scaled with sci-Plex, we induced Ascl1 in replicate for 1â5 days at varying windows of time, allowing us to temporally track the conversion of MG to neurons (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1A, B</xref>). Upon collection, nuclei were isolated in their individual treatment wells, the nuclei were barcoded with well-specific polyadenylated oligonucleotides âhashesâ, and then pooled for sci-RNA-seq2 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib45">Srivatsan et al., 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Cao et al., 2017</xref>). We recovered 12,850 cells across two experiments and 30 wells (Timecourse: 7004, Pulse: 5846) with a median UMI (unique molecular identifier) count of 3172 and 2398 after all filtering steps, respectively (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1âfigure supplement 1AâK</xref>). The hash recovery rate was 68% for both experiments (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1âfigure supplement 1C, D, G, H</xref>). The experiments were integrated and visualized by UMAP (Uniform Manifold Approximation and Projection) using Monocle3 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Cao et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Cao et al., 2019</xref>).

Most cells fell into one of four clusters: (1) MG; (2) Progenitor-like cells (ProL); (3) Transition; and (4) neuronal precursors (NeuPre). In addition, we identified other clusters of non-MG-derived cells, including microglia, astrocytes, and fibroblast-like cells (FibroL), potentially derived from vascular cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1C</xref>).</p><fig-group><fig id="fig1" position="float"><label>Figure 1.</label><caption><title>sci-Plex captures the in vitro temporal dynamics of neurogenic reprogramming from Muller glia (MG).</title><p>(<bold>A</bold>) Schematic of the sci-Plex experimental design for assaying reprogramming MG isolated from P11 mice.

We then assessed how the timing and duration of Ascl1 overexpression affected reprogramming progression when Ascl1 was added continuously (Timecourse) or pulsed (Pulse). In the Timecourse experiment, Ascl1 expression was induced for either 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, or 5 days and then the cells were collected (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1B</xref>). During the timecourse, we saw that Ascl1 stimulated a rapid transition away from MG (i.e. the start of the pseudotime trajectory) that persisted across all time points (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1E</xref>). As expected, increased duration of Ascl1 overexpression led to cells further along the pseudotime trajectory, consistent with the need for Ascl1 expression to drive cells from the ProL state toward the neuronal state. In the Pulse experiment, we initiated Ascl1 expression in all samples at the same time, but then removed doxycycline after either 1, 2, 3, 4, or 5 days to shutdown Ascl1 overexpression. The cells were all collected 5 days after the start of Ascl1 expression regardless of Ascl1 expression duration (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1B</xref>, Pulse). When Ascl1 was maintained for the entire 5 day period (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1D, E</xref>), the distribution of cells across pseudotime was similar to that observed in the Timecourse experiment, with few MG remaining. However, the pseudotime profiles were remarkably different when Ascl1 overexpression was removed for any period of time for all cell types with the exception of NeuPre (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s3">Figure 1âfigure supplement 3C</xref>). When Ascl1 was expressed in the cells for 2 or fewer days, almost all of the cells were identified as MG (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1E, F</xref>). After 3 or more days of Ascl1 expression, transition and neurogenic precursor (NeuPre) cells began to accumulate, though a substantial number of MG were also present even after 4 days of Ascl1 exposure and 1 day without when compared to the Timecourse experiment (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1F</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s3">Figure 1âfigure supplement 3C</xref>). These results suggest that even after 4 days of Ascl1 expression, removal of Ascl1 allows a subset of the cells to return to a glial state, while another subset of cells that have made it far enough along the reprogramming trajectory are no longer dependent on Ascl1 to remain committed to their neuronal fate.</p><p>To further understand the molecular features of the cells as they progress toward a more neuronal fate, we analyzed changes in gene expression around the pseudotime stage associated with a decreased reliance on Ascl1. We found the local minima (10 &lt; pseudotime &lt; 20) of pseudotime density plots from the Pulse experiment to be 16 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s4">Figure 1âfigure supplement 4A</xref>). The accumulation of cells with a pseudotime value of &gt;16 encompasses the population of cells that remain in the NeuPre or Bipolar fate even after removal of Ascl1 induction. Coincidentally, in the Timecourse experiment, decreased <italic>Ascl1</italic> expression is observed at pseudotime values &gt;16 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s4">Figure 1âfigure supplement 4B</xref>). While seemingly surprising, this decrease in <italic>Ascl1</italic> expression with continued exposure to the induction signal is a phenomenon we consistently observe in both our in vitro and in vivo reprogramming paradigms (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib50">Todd et al., 2021</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib52">Todd and Reh, 2022</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib49">Todd et al., 2020</xref>). We do not have definitive knowledge of the mechanism behind how Ascl1 expression is repressed, but it is possible that mature neurons have a mechanism to downregulate it.</p><p>To find the genes dynamically expressed during the loss of <italic>Ascl1</italic> expression and gain of a more neuronal fate, we performed differential gene expression analysis across pseudotime using cells with pseudotime values from 10 to 20 (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="fig1sdata1">Figure 1âsource data 1</xref>). We were particularly interested in identifying transcriptional regulators and signaling molecules. In the top 250 most differentially expressed genes, three major regulatory patterns (Cluster 1: increasing, Cluster 2: a transient increase, Cluster 3: decreasing) were observed (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1G, H</xref>). The downregulation of <italic>Id1</italic> and <italic>Id3</italic> in Cluster 2 was consistent with known biology: these factors (1) form heterodimers with bHLH TFs making them incapable of binding their target sites (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib43">Roschger and Cabrele, 2017</xref>) and (2) have been previously implicated in maintaining retinal progenitors and MG in a progenitor state (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Jorstad et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib42">Pollak et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Jorstad et al., 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib50">Todd et al., 2021</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib51">Todd et al., 2022</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib55">Ueki et al., 2015</xref>). Genes in Cluster 1, which increase during the progenitor-to-neuron transition, are also associated with the normal development of neurons (<italic>Elavl3</italic>, <italic>Map2</italic>) and with processes such as neuronal maturation and synaptogenesis (<italic>Nrxn3</italic>, <italic>Syt1</italic>). There were also four TFs that increased in their expression right around the loss of Ascl1 dependence: <italic>Sox4</italic>, <italic>Neurog2</italic>, <italic>Myt1</italic>, and <italic>Rorb</italic>. All of these genes are expressed in the retina during the early stages of neurogenesis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib57">Vasconcelos et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Lee et al., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Hufnagel et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Liu et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib56">Usui et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Jiang et al., 2013</xref>). Of note, <italic>Myt1</italic> is a direct target of Ascl1 and although it has been studied more thoroughly in the brain, it is associated with repression of progenitor gene expression programs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib57">Vasconcelos et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Lee et al., 2019</xref>).

Small molecules from the TocrisScreen Stem Cell Library were added at the same time as the doxycycline and remained in culture until the cells were collected on Day 5 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2B</xref>). The compounds were applied across three doses (0.1, 1, and 10 uM) with each compound being tested on one of two different collection days. We included three wells per collection day in which only doxycycline was added (Only Ascl1) and three wells per collection day in which doxycycline was not added (No Ascl1). To maximize the range of compounds tested, we opted to perform the sci-Plex experiment once, and then follow-up with compounds that elicited strong effects through subsequent in vivo validation experiments.

A hash could be called for 65â74% of the cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s1">Figure 2âfigure supplement 1C, F</xref>). We performed dimensionality reduction and clustering with Monocle3 and used marker genes to annotate cell types by cluster. All cell types not of retinal/MG origin were discarded (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s2">Figure 2âfigure supplement 2AâC</xref>), and the dimensionality reduction and cell type annotation was repeated (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2C</xref>).</p><p>To identify the molecules most likely to promote reprogramming, we pooled the clusters corresponding to neurogenic precursors (NeuPre: <italic>Gap43</italic>, <italic>Snap25</italic>, <italic>Dcx</italic>) and bipolar neurons (BP: <italic>Snap25</italic>, <italic>Vsx2</italic>, <italic>Cabp5</italic>, <italic>Otx2</italic>, <italic>Grik1</italic>) together into a common Neuron annotation and for each drug, calculated the abundance of Neurons relative to Ascl1 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2</xref>). Many of the molecules did not have clear effects on the reprogramming process. However, we found several molecules that increased neurogenesis and others that reduced neurogenesis. The molecules that most markedly increased the percentage of Neurons, included DBZ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">Milano et al., 2004</xref>), DMH-1 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Hao et al., 2010</xref>), RepSox (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Ichida et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Gellibert et al., 2004</xref>), SB 431542 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Inman et al., 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Laping et al., 2002</xref>), and WH-4-023 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib47">Theunissen et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Clark et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">Martin et al., 2006</xref>). These compounds target one of three molecular signaling pathways: Notch, BMP/TGF-beta, and LCK/SRC. We also calculated the number of cells recovered per well, and noticed that for a few treatments, far more total cells, regardless of cell type identity, were recovered than average. This was most prominent for metformin, sodium 4-phenylbutyrate, and valproic acid (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2E</xref>). Both sodium 4-phenylbutyrate and valproic acid are HDAC inhibitors which is of interest because TSA (Trichostatin A), another HDAC inhibitor, is a significant stimulus for Ascl1-dependent reprogramming in vivo (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Jorstad et al., 2017</xref>). Unexpectedly, metformin, a compound that is approved for the treatment of diabetes with other potential clinical uses (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Cicero et al., 2012</xref>), also increased cell recovery in our assay. Because metformin has not been evaluated in the context of retinal reprogramming, we decided to pursue it and the five compounds that increased neurogenesis with further experiments in vivo. Thus, the use of sci-Plex aided us in narrowing down 92 compounds to 6 for follow-up investigations.</p><p>In addition to detecting shifts along the reprogramming trajectory, we also detected what appeared to be previously undetected cell states (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2C</xref>, Unknown clusters). To characterize these, we performed Biological Process GO term enrichment on genes with high regional specificity for each cluster (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="fig2sdata2">Figure 2âsource data 2</xref>). Cluster Unknown 1 was enriched with genes related to ER stress, Unknown 2 had markers of Immune reactive cells, and Unknown 3 had non-retinal neuronal characteristics (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s3">Figure 2âfigure supplement 3AâC</xref>, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="fig2sdata2">Figure 2âsource data 2</xref>). The Unknown 4 cells had 77 genes with high specificity to the cluster, but only two enriched gene sets âregulation of ion transmembrane transportâ and âaction potentialâ (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="fig2sdata2">Figure 2âsource data 2</xref>). With such a small number of enriched gene sets, we were unable to make further conclusions about the identity of that cell cluster and have left them annotated as Unknown.</p><p>We next set out to understand how each treatment altered the distribution of cells across these novel clusters. We generated a heatmap in which treatments with similar cell type compositions were clustered together (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s4">Figure 2âfigure supplement 4A</xref>). In doing this, we found that for a small number of treatments, the majority of cells come from either the ER stressed cluster of cells or the Unknown cluster of cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s4">Figure 2âfigure supplement 4B</xref>). Interestingly, the treatments that led to the Unknown cluster include two HDAC inhibitors (CI 994, SAHA) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Kraker, 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Butler et al., 2000</xref>). It is possible that these cells are deregulated without having yet experienced a change in fate toward a more specific cell type. The treatments that lead to increased cell counts in the ER stressed cluster include two bromodomain (acetylated lysine binders) inhibitors (I-BET 151 dihydrochloride, CPI 203) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Devaiah et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Dawson et al., 2011</xref>). While these observations do not directly help us identify better treatments for reprogramming MG, they do help us find compounds that affect the molecular state of MG cells exposed to Ascl1 overexpression (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Jorstad et al., 2017</xref>).</p></sec><sec id="s2-3"><title>Validating sci-Plex hits in an in vivo neuronal regeneration paradigm</title><p>We next aimed to assess whether the positive hits that increased neurogenesis from the in vitro sci-Plex screen could be validated in vivo. Before testing compounds from the in vitro screen in vivo, we sought to validate that in vivo MG express the signaling pathways targeted by our small molecule compounds during neurogenic reprogramming. We analyzed scRNA-seq libraries made from our in vivo regeneration experiments where we used mice engineered to express Ascl1 specifically in the MG (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3A</xref>), then induced retinal injury with an intravitreal injection of NMDA, and a co-injection of TSA (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3B</xref>). The mice were sacrificed and GFP expressing cells were sorted and subjected to 10Ã scRNA-seq either 5, 9, or 21 days after injury the day 5 and 9 libraries were originally published in <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib49">Todd et al., 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s2">Figure 3âfigure supplement 2A, B</xref>.

A small number of rod and cone cells are present even in the earliest time point and most likely are contaminating cells from the FACS (fluorescence-activated cell sorting). As expected, with increasing time after injury, we observe greater numbers of MG-derived bipolar cells. This is most evident in the time between 9 and 21 days. However, even between 5 and 9 days there is a small increase in bipolar cells. Additionally, when pseudotime analysis was performed, a shift in the MG cluster toward a more mature state became apparent even by 9 days (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3E</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s3">Figure 3âfigure supplement 3A, B</xref>). Lastly, using the pseudotime analysis across all time points, we looked at how the expression of key target genes for each of the drugs are expressed throughout the reprogramming process (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3F</xref>). In all cases, at least some of the target genes are expressed early and decrease over time, making them ideal candidates for small molecule intervention.</p><fig-group><fig id="fig3" position="float"><label>Figure 3.</label><caption><title>Validation of sci-Plex hits in an in vivo neuronal regeneration paradigm.</title><p>(<bold>A</bold>) Schematic of the transgenic mouse used to induce Ascl1 and GFP specifically in Muller glia (MG).

We originally also identified RepSox as a hit, but because RepSox and SB43152 have the same target, we decided to only pursue SB43152. Ascl1 was induced in the MG with tamoxifen, retinal injury was performed by NMDA, and TSA was given in conjunction with one of the small molecule hits from the screen; animals were sacrificed 2 weeks later, and their retinas were assayed for lineage traced MG-derived cells (GFP+) and the retinal neuronal maker (Otx2+) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3G</xref>). Out of the compounds tested, two significantly boosted the number of Otx2+ neuronal cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3HâJ</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s4">Figure 3âfigure supplement 4A</xref>). The first identified compound was DBZ, a Î³-secretase/Notch inhibitor (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3I</xref>). This is consistent with reports in the chick retina where the Î³-secretase inhibitor DAPT increased neuronal differentiation from proliferating MG (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Hayes et al., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Ghai et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib48">Todd et al., 2016</xref>). Inhibition of Notch is also well known to promote neural differentiation from retinal progenitors in mouse and human (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Finkbeiner et al., 2022</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">Nelson et al., 2007</xref><ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://paperpile.com/c/yFv8Ib/jEaAY+nrjr6">)</ext-link>. While this result was not unexpected, DBZ represents a new compound found to promote neurogenesis in the mammalian retina. The second positive hit, metformin, showed the biggest effect on MG-neurogenesis (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3H, I</xref>). In some retinas, metformin increased the rate of neurogenesis to 75% of the Ascl1-expressing MG, a higher rate than any of our previous pharmaceutical treatments. The MG-derived neurons expressed Otx2 and were primarily located in the INL (inner nuclear layer); this is similar to what we observe in the ANT treatment condition, and so it does not appear that metformin altered the fates of the MG-derived neurons; In addition, the neurons in the metformin treated retinas do not express markers of ganglion/amacrine cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s4">Figure 3âfigure supplement 4B</xref>). These in vivo experiments thus confirm that the in vitro sci-Plex screening is an effective method to identify new compounds that increase the regeneration potential of mammalian MG.</p></sec></sec><sec id="s3" sec-type="discussion"><title>Discussion</title><p>Screening large numbers of chemical compounds has become a routine path to drug discovery, but limitations remain. Most high-throughput screening assays use relatively limited read-outs, such as cell morphology, proliferation or changes in expression of a reporter. Many assays cannot access molecular information about responding cells or identify factors that make a cell type resistant to a treatment. Single-cell transcriptomic assays overcome these hurdles, but the conventional protocols are costly and highly limited in sample number. Here, we demonstrate for the first time the utility of sci-Plex, an ultra-scalable scRNA-seq protocol, for studying reprogramming primary cells through screening drugs in low-input cultures and subsequently validating them in vivo. Our experiments both identified drugs that support reprogramming and revealed underlying biology important for the progression of glial cell reprogramming.</p><p>We first used sci-Plex to pinpoint the moment during in vitro reprogramming at which cells become committed toward a neurogenic cell fate independent of continued Ascl1 expression. Next, we tested 92 compounds across 3 doses each and identified 6 molecules of interest, two of which also had significant proneural effects in vivo. With our observation that cells no longer require Ascl1 to maintain their neuronal identity after a certain point along their reprogramming trajectory, we looked at the transcriptional regulators that were changing in their expression around this point and identified Myt1 as a potentially critical factor for commitment toward the neuronal fate. Myt1 is a zinc finger-containing DNA-binding TF that is found specifically in neuronal cells and is important in neuronal differentiation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib57">Vasconcelos et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Bellefroid et al., 1996</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Kim and Hudson, 1992</xref>). In neural stem cells, the <italic>Myt1</italic> promoter is bound by Ascl1 and protein expression is induced following the overexpression of Ascl1 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib57">Vasconcelos et al., 2016</xref>). Myt1 and its family member Myt1l function by binding to and repressing their target genes which include non-neuronal genes, progenitor genes, and regulators of Notch signaling (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib57">Vasconcelos et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">Mall et al., 2017</xref>). Myt1l has also been associated with aiding in the in vitro reprogramming of fibroblasts to neurons (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib57">Vasconcelos et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">Mall et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib58">Vierbuchen et al., 2010</xref>). However, little is known about its role in the retina, and no previous reports indicate a direct role for Myt1 in committing cells to the neuronal fate after the removal of other proneural TFs. Additional work will be needed to determine whether Myt1 is the regulator holding cells in the neuronal fate after removal of Ascl1 in our Pulse experiment, but the depth of information that can be obtained by single-cell sequencing provided us with an intriguing candidate gene.</p><p>The first hit of our screen was the Notch inhibitor DBZ. It targets the ability of gamma-secretase to cleave the intracellular domain of activated Notch receptors. While DBZ has not previously been used in retinal reprogramming studies, Notch is well known to affect neurogenesis and neural regeneration in the retina. Pharmacological manipulation of Notch signaling has been used to alter the proliferative and neurogenic capacity of MG in fish and chick retina (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Hayes et al., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Ghai et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Conner et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib59">Wan et al., 2012</xref>). It is also interesting that Myt1, identified in our Pulse experiment as a factor that may prevent neuronal cells from returning to the progenitor fate, inhibits Notch signaling (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib57">Vasconcelos et al., 2016</xref>). That our screen recovered a Î³-secretase inhibitor, in line with the known role of Notch in the retina, confirmed the ability of our workflow to identify important regulators.</p><p>Unexpectedly, the second compound that increased neurogenesis in vivo was metformin. Mechanistically, metformin is typically thought to work via AMPK, and while used clinically for Type2 diabetes, many studies have noted its neuroprotective and anti-neuroinflammatory effects (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">Markowicz-Piasecka et al., 2017</xref>). In our screen, metformin increased the total number of cells recovered by sci-Plex, including those in the neurogenic precursor stage. Even with the increased number of cells recovered compared to other treatments, the small number of cells recovered from each treatment by sci-Plex made it difficult to identify confident DEGs. However, by leveraging follow-up experiments in vivo we did find that metformin had a clear effect on neurogenesis from Ascl1-reprogrammed MG. The effect we find on neurogenesis is consistent with the promotion of neurogenesis reported in another in vitro study using mouse cortical and hippocampal progenitors and human ESC-derived neural progenitors (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib60">Wang et al., 2012</xref>), and may in part be mediated by Gadd45g, via DNA methylation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib61">Zhang et al., 2022</xref>). Moreover, metformin restored blood flow and vascular density in aged mice and promoted neurogenesis from the SVZ in vivo and in vitro (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib63">Zhu et al., 2020</xref>). Further investigations of this molecule in astrocyte to neuronal reprogramming in other regions of the CNS will be necessary to validate the utility of metformin in in vivo neural regeneration more generally.</p><p>Repairing the nervous system has been an elusive goal, and while progress is being made with transplantation of pluripotent stem cell derived neurons, there are many complexities in neural transplantation. Reprogramming glia to serve as a source of neural repair is a strategy utilized by non-mammalian vertebrates, and inspired by nature, we and others have shown that harnessing this latent neural regenerative capacity by proneural TF over-expression can revive the neuronal reprogramming program in mammals. Layering in the use of small molecules can increase the efficiency of such reprogramming, and we show here that screening through larger libraries of compounds at single-cell resolution in vitro can point us toward new in vivo hits. We are particularly excited by the future therapeutic potential of our compounds: metformin and DBZ; as well as the use of similar screening strategies for the identification of treatments in glial-based regeneration and wider contexts.</p></sec><sec id="s4" sec-type="materials|methods"><title>Materials and methods</title><sec id="s4-1"><title>Mouse injections and husbandry</title><p>Mice were housed and treated under University of Washington Institutional Animal Care and Use Committee approved (UW-IACUC: 2448-08).

To find the sets of genes that most specifically define these unknown clusters, for each gene, the fraction of cells within a cluster that express the gene as well as the mean expression of that gene within a cluster were calculated. The mean expression values were then normalized to sum to one across all cell types for a given gene. This was used as input for Jensen Shannon distance calculations comparing the observed normalized expression distribution across cell types to simulated distributions in which all expression of a given gene comes from a single-cell type. This was done for each cell type across all genes. Specificity scores were calculated by subtracting the Jensen Shannon distance from 1.

How efficiently would the sci-Plex system work for in vitro screen of mature murine MG?</p></disp-quote><p>Thank you for bringing this up. While a protocol for the conversion of MG to neurons with adult mice in vivo exists, it has proven to be more difficult to maintain adult MG in dissociated cell cultures, due to their more limited proliferation in vitro. This makes it difficult to use the sci-Plex assay, since cell number is limiting for treatment conditions. Therefore, we have chosen the strategy of screening on P11, where MG undergo proliferative cell divisions in dissociated cultures, allowing us to grow the millions of cells needed for this assay, and then to test the efficacy of the compounds we find from the screen with an adult in vivo assay.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>(2) The study identified and tested the compounds individually, how would a combination of the compounds work in vivo? It would be interesting to examine how different combinations may affect the reprogramming efficiency and neuronal compositions.</p></disp-quote><p>We agree that this would be very interesting to investigate. However, the number of treatment conditions then expands beyond the scale of the current sci-Plex technology with the number of MG that we are able to collect. We instead adopted the strategy of casting a very wide net to identify additional molecular pathways that might be important in the reprogramming process.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>(3) In-depth mechanistic and/or functional studies of the reprogrammed MG are highly desirable to improve the quality and significance of the study and to better understand how the compounds may influence the signaling and the reprogramming process.</p></disp-quote><p>While we agree that this would strengthen the study, this would increase the scope of the required revisions considerably. We are very interested in following up on some of the hits and look forward to providing additional details of mechanisms in future publications. However, we feel that reporting this method and the results will stimulate those interested in reprogramming glia in other areas of the nervous system to test the compounds we identified in this assay.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p><bold>Reviewer #2 (Recommendations For The Authors):</bold></p><p>(1) The authors employed two protocols to initiate direct reprogramming of MG into retinal neurons in vitro. These protocols, referred to as &quot;Timecourse&quot; and &quot;Pulse,&quot; involved short-term treatments lasting no more than 5 days. However, the findings obtained indicate that these brief treatments were insufficient to achieve a stable conversion. This conclusion is supported by the comparison between the &quot;4 days (Timecourse)&quot; and &quot;4 days (Pulse)&quot; conditions, as depicted in Figure 1 (D and E). In this set of experiments, labeling cells that express specific neuronal markers as neurons raises concerns, as these cells may have multiple fates, either died, reverted, arrested in certain intermediate stages, or converted to functional neurons. It is thus critical to determine whether the conversion to functional neurons is enhanced.</p></disp-quote><p>We thank you for your concern about this. We aimed to be very careful in our naming. In our naming scheme for this figure, we only consider the small number of cells with specific Bipolar markers (Trpm1, Grm6, Capb5, Otx2) neurons based on previous publications ((Jorstad et al. 2017; Todd et al. 2021; Todd et al. 2022; Todd et al. 2020)). The other cells that have some neuronal markers are identified as neuronal precursors (NeuPre) and are, as you mentioned, not necessarily mature/functional. While these NeuPre cells may eventually have multiple fates/may die/may revert to more ProL cells at some rate we believe itâs fair to define them as Neuronal Precursors due to the genes they are expressing (Dcx, Snap25, Elavl3, Gap43) at the moment of collection.</p><p>Furthermore, your statement indicating that âthe findings obtained indicate that these brief treatments were insufficient to achieve a stable conversionâ is not what we intended to demonstrate. The text will be reworked to reflect what we hoped to convey. We acknowledge that (1) the majority cells are not stably converted, and (2) the levels of NeuPre cells are lower in the Pulse experiment overall, but this is true even at Day 5 when the conditions should be the same across experiments. The Pulse and Timecourse experiments were done on different days, and having previously found that there are differences in MG to BP conversion rate from experiment to experiment, these results were not unexpected. Of more note to us was that while ProL cells, Transition cells, and MG have very different patterns of abundance across time when comparing the experiments, the NeuPre cells accumulate at a similar time and pattern across the two experiments. This indicated to us that they uniquely have some amount of Ascl1 independent stability in their cell fate even when exposed to Ascl1 for as little as 3 days. See Author response image 1 below. This plot will be added to Fig. S1.</p><fig id="sa3fig1" position="float"><label>Author response image 1.</label><graphic mimetype="image" mime-subtype="tiff" xlink:href="elife-92091-sa3-fig1-v1.tif"/></fig><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>(2) The authors made a claim that a pseudo time value of 15 represents a crucial timepoint where the transition in cell fate becomes stable and ceases to rely on ectopic Ascl1 expression. However, it is essential to provide concrete evidence to substantiate this assertion. It is prudent to perform quantitative analyses rather than relying solely on the deduced trajectory to make this claim.</p></disp-quote><p>This is a fair point, the value of 15 was estimated by eye. We have returned to the data and estimated a density function for the pseudotime scores of the cells from the 1, 2, 3, and 4 day conditions in both the Pulse and Timecourse experiments (Author response image 2A-B below). We then calculated 16 to be the local minima between the pseudotime values of 10-20 for the Pulse experiment (Blue line). When comparing the two experiments, itâs apparent that there is a massive accumulation of cells with a pseudotime value just lower than 16 in the Timecouse experiment (values 10-15), and very few cells across the same region for the Pulse experiment, indicating some dependence on continued Ascl1 expression for the cell fate that exists from pseudotime 10-16 (mostly ProL cells). To the contrary, cells with greater pseudotime values exist across both experiments at similar levels.</p><p>We have also looked at the expression of Ascl1 along the pseudotime trajectory in the Timecourse experiment. Interestingly, and consistent with experiments in previous studies, both in vitro and in vivo (Todd et al. 2021; Todd et al. 2022; Todd et al. 2020), we see a decrease in Ascl1 expression as the cells move towards the end of the pseudotime trajectory (C below). Itâs intriguing to us that the downregulation also happens right after a pseudotime value of 16. The temporal coalescence of the loss of Ascl1 expression in the Timecourse experiment with the persistence of cells with pseudotime values &gt; 16 in the Pulse experiment provides strong evidence that we have identified the point at which cells stop expressing Ascl1 while maintaining more mature cell fates. The plots below will be added to the manuscript.</p><fig id="sa3fig2" position="float"><label>Author response image 2.</label><graphic mimetype="image" mime-subtype="tiff" xlink:href="elife-92091-sa3-fig2-v1.tif"/></fig><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>(3) It is intriguing to observe that the expression of Ascl1 was down-regulated in both neuronal precursors and bipolar cells in the mouse retina following tamoxifen and NMDA treatment (refer to Fig. 3C). However, the expression of ectopical Ascl1 should have been constitutively activated by tamoxifen. Therefore, if the GFP+ bipolar cells and neuronal precursors were indeed converted from MÃ¼ller cells, we would expect to capture a high level of Ascl1 expression. How to account for this discrepancy? How is the expression exogenous Ascl1 expressed from a constitutive promoter attenuated?</p></disp-quote><p>As discussed above, this has been observed previously. Ascl1 driven from the TTA transgenic mouse line is high in the MG, but declines as these cells are reprogrammed into neurons in vivo or in vitro. One possibility is that the TTA is not as active in neurons as in MG, but in other lines of transgenic mice, eg. TRE-Atoh1 mice, the transgene continues to be expressed at a high level even in the differentiating neurons, so this downregulation appears to be unique to Ascl1. We do not understand why Ascl1 levels decline in the differentiating neurons, but this has been a consistent finding across several studies of in vivo and in vitro reprogramming.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>(4) Exogenous Ascl1 was shut down after other neuronal specific genes were induced during MG reprogramming in vitro. Is this also the case during Ascl1-mediated reprogramming in vivo? If so, do converting cells show a distinct gene expression program if exogenous Ascl1 is constitutively overexpressed?</p></disp-quote><p>Yes, as can be seen in Fig 3C Ascl1 expression is high in the MG and Transition cell populations, but decreases in the NeuPre and Bipolar cells. As stated above, continued high Ascl1 expression keeps cells in a more progenitor-like state. This is true in vivo and in vitro. It has been more clearly addressed upon revision.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>(5) As previously documented in their Science Advances publication, the authors have established the requirement of NMDA injury for facilitating the successful induction of neuronal conversion through Ascl1 over-expression. Why is injury required for MG conversion in vivo, but not in vitro? This is related to question #1 above that certain signals may be required for the full conversion process, not just the initial induction of a few neuronal specific genes.</p></disp-quote><p>While the in vitro and in vivo systems share similarities, there are key differences, which affect what must be done to the cells in order to produce converted neurons. In our initial publication demonstrating that Ascl1 can reprogram mouse MG to a neurogenic state, we carried out our experiments in dissociated cell cultures (Pollak et al 2013) like those described in this report. At that time, we did not need to add either NMDA or TSA to the cultures to induce neurogenesis from Ascl1. However, when we attempted the reprogramming in vivo, we found that after postnatal day 8, injury and TSA were required in vivo (Ueki et al; Jorstad et al). We surmise that the massive neuronal loss that occurs in establishing dissociated MG cultures replaces the NMDA injury we carry out in vivo.</p><p>To your second point about the requirement for more than âjust the initial induction of a few neuronal specific genesâ. This is definitely true. When we carry out reprogramming in vivo with Ascl1 or other transcription factors, the MG-derived neurons acquire neuronal morphology, develop neuron-like electrophysiological properties, integrate into the retinal circuit and respond to light stimulus; however, they are still not identical in gene expression or morphology to normal retinal neurons. This is why we are continuously looking for more compounds or conditions that can help improve the process.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>(6) The discovery that Metformin acts as a stimulator for MG-to-neuron conversion is interesting.</p><p>However, before drawing definitive conclusions, several questions need to be addressed:</p><p>(a) As specific small molecules have been identified to change cell fates, the question is whether Metformin and other effective compounds can function alone or have to effect in conjunction with Ascl1? This can and should be tested in vitro by simply treating MG with Metformin but not doxycycline.</p></disp-quote><p>To our knowledge there are no convincing in vivo trials in which neurons have been generated from MG using only combinations of small molecules. Because Metformin was identified in vitro due to the increase in recovered cells and not an increase in % neurons, we especially doubt it would have the desired increase in neurons without expression of a transcription factor.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>(b) Metformin is known to target AMPK, but this is unlikely the only target of the drug. Does AMPK knockdown have the same enhancement effect?</p></disp-quote><p>In the drug screen, we also tested the AMPK inhibitor Dorsomorphin dihydrochloride, but it didnât have any effect. However, Metformin is an activator, so it would be interesting to see in future studies if Dorsomorphin dihydrochloride could inhibit the effect of Metformin or if the enhancement is acting independently.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>(c) Is the effect of Metformin specific for Ascl1 or any TF(s) that stimulates MG-to-neuron conversion?</p></disp-quote><p>We would like to follow up with this in future.</p></body></sub-article></article>
