African-descent populations and is associated with increased cancer risk in humans and mice. Due to impaired repression of the cystine importer <italic>Slc7a11</italic>, S47 cells show increased glutathione (GSH) accumulation compared to cells with wild -type p53. We show that mice containing the S47 variant display increased mTOR activity and oxidative metabolism, as well as larger size, improved metabolic efficiency, and signs of superior fitness. Mechanistically, we show that mTOR and its positive regulator Rheb display increased association in S47 cells; this is due to an altered redox state of GAPDH in S47 cells that inhibits its ability to bind and sequester Rheb. Compounds that decrease glutathione normalize GAPDH-Rheb complexes and mTOR activity in S47 cells. This study reveals a novel layer of regulation of mTOR by p53, and raises the possibility that this variant may have been selected for in early Africa.</p></abstract><kwd-group

regulator of the cellular response to intrinsic and extrinsic stress. Mutations in the <italic>TP53</italic> gene occur in more than 50% of human cancers, and this gene is well known as the most frequently mutated gene in cancer (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Hollstein et al., 1991</xref>). p53 works to suppress uncontrolled cellular growth and proliferation through various pathways including apoptosis, senescence, cell cycle arrest, and ferroptosis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">Stockwell et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">Vousden and Prives, 2009</xref>). More recently, a role for p53 in the control of metabolism has emerged. The metabolic functions of p53 include the regulation of mitochondrial function, autophagy, cellular redox state, and the control of lipid and carbohydrate metabolism; for review see <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Berkers et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Gnanapradeepan et al., 2018</xref>.</p><p>As an integral part of its control of metabolism, p53 negatively regulates the activity of mTOR (mammalian target of rapamycin), which is a master regulator of metabolism in the cell. mTOR is a serine-threonine protein kinase that is stimulated by mitogenic signals, and phosphorylates downstream targets that in turn regulate protein synthesis and cell growth (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Ben-Sahra and Manning, 2017</xref>). mTOR exists in two distinct signaling complexes: mTORC1 is primarily responsible for cell growth and protein synthesis, while mTORC2 plays roles in growth factor signaling, cytoskeletal control, and cell spreading (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Liu and Sabatini, 2020</xref>). Not surprisingly, mTOR activity is frequently upregulated in a diverse range of cancers. p53 negatively regulates the mTOR pathway in part through transactivation of the target genes <italic>PTEN</italic>, <italic>TSC2</italic>, <italic>PRKAB1</italic> and <italic>SESN1/SESN2</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Budanov and Karin, 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Feng et al., 2005</xref>). The regulation of mTOR by p53 is believed to couple the control of genome integrity with the decision to proliferate (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Hasty et al., 2013</xref>).</p><p><italic>TP53</italic> harbors several functionally impactful genetic variants or single-nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Basu et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Jennis et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Kung et al., 2016</xref>). A naturally occurring SNP in <italic>TP53</italic> exists at codon 47, encoding serine instead of a proline (Pro47Ser, rs1800371, G/A). This variant exists predominantly in African-descent populations, and occurs in roughly 1% of African Americans and 6% of Africans from sub-Saharan Africa (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Murphy et al., 2017</xref>). The S47 variant is associated with increased risk for pre-menopausal breast cancer in African American women (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Murphy et al., 2017</xref>). In a mouse model, the S47 mouse develops markedly increased incidence of spontaneous cancer, particularly hepatocellular carcinoma (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Jennis et al., 2016</xref>). This variant is likewise defective in the regulation of the small subset of p53 target genes that play roles in ferroptosis sensitivity, including the cystine importer <italic>SLC7A11.</italic> As a result, increased levels of cysteine and glutathione (GSH) accumulate in cells from S47 humans and mice (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Jennis et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Leu et al., 2019</xref>). More recently, we showed that the ferroptotic defect in S47 mice leads to iron accumulation in their livers, spleens, and macrophages. We also showed that the S47 variant is positively associated with markers of iron overload in African Americans (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">Singh et al., 2020</xref>).</p><p>An emerging paradigm in the cancer literature is that tumor-predisposing genetic variants may paradoxically provide selection benefit to individuals, thus potentially explaining the frequency of these damaging alleles in the population. As an example, women carrying tumor-predisposing mutations in the <italic>BRCA1</italic> gene tend to be physically larger and show increased fertility (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Smith et al., 2012</xref>). Here-in we show that mice carrying a knock-in S47 allele in a pure C57Bl/6 background show increased size, lean content (muscle), and metabolic efficiency, relative to littermate mice with WT p53. We report that mouse and human S47 cells show a significant increase in mTOR activity, due in part to increased mTOR-Rheb binding in S47 cells. We propose that these attributes may have led to a positive selection for this variant in sub-Saharan Africa. Our studies shed further light on the intricate regulation that exists between p53, mTOR activity, and metabolic output, in this case mediated by GSH and the control of cellular redox state.</p></sec><sec id="s2" sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><sec id="s2-1"><title>Higher basal mTOR activity in cells containing the S47 variant</title><p>We previously showed that human lymphoblastoid cells (LCLs) that are homozygous for the S47 variant of p53 are impaired for the transcriptional regulation of less than a dozen p53 target genes, compared to cells from individuals from the same family containing WT p53 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Jennis et al., 2016</xref>). We noted that several of these genes encode proteins that play roles in the negative regulation of mTOR (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Budanov and Karin, 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Feng et al., 2007</xref>). We confirmed via qRT-PCR that S47 LCLs show modestly decreased expression of the p53 target genes <italic>SESN1</italic> and <italic>PTEN,</italic> and decreased transactivation of <italic>PRKAB1</italic>, relative to WT LCLs following cisplatin treatment (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1A and B</xref>). These findings prompted us to assess basal mTOR activity in WT and S47 LCLs, and in MEFs from WT and S47 mice. To corroborate our findings, we also analyzed tissues from humanized p53 knock-in (Hupki) mice carrying WT and S47 alleles on a pure C57Bl/6 background, which we previously generated and characterized (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Jennis et al., 2016</xref>). Western blot analysis of WT and S47 LCLs, along with multiple clones of WT and S47 MEFs, revealed increased p-S6K1 (Thr389) in S47 cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1A</xref>). Following normalization to total S6K1, this increase ranged between two- and threefold (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1B</xref>). We next compared mTOR activity in age- and sex-matched pairs of lung and muscle tissue from WT and S47 mice; we did this because mTOR activity is influenced by age and gender, and there is increased mTOR activity in female and older mice (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Baar et al., 2016</xref>). We found increased levels of p-S6K1 (T389) and p-mTOR (Ser2448) in S47 lung and skeletal muscle, relative to WT tissues (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1C and D</xref>). Immunohistochemical analysis of tissues from multiple age- and sex-matched WT and S47 mice confirmed these findings (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1E</xref>).

Treatment with the compound erastin, which inhibits the system Xc(-) cystine transporter and decreases GSH, also led to altered mobility of GAPDH in S47 and WT cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5s1">Figure 5—figure supplement 1B</xref>). We next tested the impact of modulating GSH on the interaction between Rheb and GAPDH in WT and S47 cells using both IP-western and PLA. By IP-western we found that supplementation of culture media with exogenous GSH decreased the Rheb-GAPDH interaction in WT cells; conversely, depleting free GSH using either BSO or DEM increased the Rheb-GAPDH interaction in S47 cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5D</xref>). These findings were corroborated using PLA, which revealed that depleting GSH using either DEM or BSO completely restores GAPDH-Rheb complex formation and mTOR-Rheb complex formation in S47 cells, to levels equivalent to WT cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5E and F</xref>; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5s1">Figure 5—figure supplement 1C</xref>). The combined data support the conclusion that the increased GSH pool in S47 cells affects the status of reactive cysteines in GAPDH, and the ability of this protein to bind and sequester Rheb, thereby leading to increased Rheb-mTOR interaction and increased mTOR activity in S47 cells.</p></sec><sec id="s2-4"><title>Enhanced metabolic efficiency of S47 mice</title><p>mTOR is known to regulate body mass and muscle regeneration (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Laplante and Sabatini, 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib46">Yoon, 2017</xref>). We therefore next assessed body weight and fat/lean content in age-matched male mice of WT and S47 genotypes. We also tracked body weight with age of multiple male and female sibling littermate mice of WT/WT, WT/S47, and S47/S47 genotypes in our colony. S47 mice showed significantly increased weight with time, compared to WT/WT and WT/S47 sibling littermates (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6s1">Figure 6—figure supplement 1A</xref>).

For this analysis, we studied eight age-matched male mice of each genotype during a 50 min forced exercise at increasing speed and slope. During this time course, oxygen consumption and serum metabolites were quantified. Consistent with our CLAMs experiment, S47 mice started with lower basal VO<sub>2</sub> and exhibited generally lower VO<sub>2</sub> for the work being performed; however, as they approached the final, most strenuous point of the exercise, the VO<sub>2</sub> values in WT and S47 converged, so the VO<sub>2</sub> range for S47 mice was significantly greater than WT mice (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6C–E</xref>). Analysis of serum metabolites and proteins before and after exercise revealed decreased lactate dehydrogenase (LDH) levels in the sera of S47 mice, which is indicative of decreased muscle damage in S47 mice compared to WT (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6F</xref>). Additionally, we found that Ki-67 staining in S47 skeletal muscle was consistently increased relative to WT muscle, suggesting an enhanced ability for S47 muscle to recover (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6s1">Figure 6—figure supplement 1C</xref>). In these tissues, we found no differences in p53 level or markers of mitochondrial content (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6s1">Figure 6—figure supplement 1D and E</xref>), nor were there other differences in other serum metabolites between WT and S47 mice (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6s1">Figure 6—figure supplement 1F</xref>). These exercise data, like the CLAMS data, point to increased metabolic efficiency in S47 mice relative to WT mice. To address this further, we analyzed a small cohort of WT and S47 mice on a continuous strenuous treadmill run. Although the numbers are small, we found that three out of four WT mice failed to complete a 60 min strenuous run, while three out of four S47 successfully completed this run (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6s1">Figure 6—figure supplement 1G</xref>).</p></sec></sec><sec id="s3" sec-type="discussion"><title>Discussion</title><p>In this study, we report that cells and mice with the S47 variant of p53 have increased mTOR activity and evidence for increased metabolic efficiency. The animals also display increased mass and signs of superior fitness. Our data support the premise that the enhanced mTOR activity is due, at least in part, to the higher levels of GSH in S47 cells and tissues. The increased GSH results in impaired ability of the redox sensitive protein GAPDH to bind to Rheb. This leads to greater mTOR-Rheb binding, resulting in increased mTOR activity in S47 cells and tissues. These data indicate that, along with pH (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib40">Walton et al., 2018</xref>), cellular redox status can also regulate mTOR activity, in a manner controlled by p53. We show that oxidative metabolism in S47 cells is less sensitive to mTOR inhibitors, thus tying these two phenotypes together; this is not surprising, as a link between mTOR and a number of cellular metabolic processes is well known (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Morita et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">Schieke et al., 2006</xref>).</p><p>We see evidence for increased mTOR activity only in certain tissues of the S47 mouse, so the metabolic impact of this genetic variant appears to be influenced by tissue type and cellular environment. At present, we do not know if this tissue specificity is due to differences in GSH level, or to altered mTOR-Rheb or GAPDH-Rheb interactions in different tissues, or to other parameters. We also see evidence for some unexpected findings regarding the increase in mTOR activity in S47 cells: given that mTOR negatively regulates autophagy (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Jung et al., 2010</xref>), we expected to see differences in steady state autophagy or autophagic flux in WT and S47 cells, but we found no evidence for this. This finding may be due to the rather complex relationship between mTOR and autophagy (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Jung et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib42">White et al., 2011</xref>), and/or that other signaling pathways regulate autophagy aside from mTOR, including the PI3K pathway, GTPases, and calcium (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib43">Yang et al., 2005</xref>).</p><p>The increased lean content in S47 mice likely contributes to the increased fitness observed in these mice. Human studies have shown that mTOR activation is crucial for human muscle protein synthesis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Dickinson and Rasmussen, 2011</xref>). Treatment with the well-studied mTOR inhibitor rapamycin blocks the effects of amino acid ingestion on mTOR activity and leads to decreased protein synthesis in human skeletal muscle (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Dickinson and Rasmussen, 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Drummond et al., 2009</xref>). Additionally, mTOR signaling driven through IGF-1 plays a key role in promoting muscle hypertrophy (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Coleman et al., 1995</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Musarò et al., 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">Vandenburgh et al., 1991</xref>). One caveat of this study, however, is that we do not directly demonstrate that the increased mTOR activity in S47 mice is causing their increased lean content or superior performance on treadmill assays. Transient treatment with mTOR inhibitors elicits highly complex and often contrasting effects on energy expenditure and treadmill performance, likely due to the existence of feedback loops and the effect of inhibitors on multiple organ systems in the mouse. As just two examples: rapamycin has shown contrasting effects on energy expenditure in animals, depending on how long mice are treated (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Fang et al., 2013</xref>); similarly, treatment of mice with rapamycin has shown limited impact on treadmill endurance, despite causing decreased expression of genes involved in mitochondrial biogenesis and oxidative phosphorylation in the muscle (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib45">Ye et al., 2013</xref>). Possibly, the most consistent findings in the literature reflect the general consensus that mTORC1 is involved in mechanisms that drive increased muscle mass (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Goodman, 2019</xref>) and that heightened mTOR activity leads to enhanced muscle recovery after exercise (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">Song et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib46">Yoon, 2017</xref>). It remains to be tested if these are the pathways affected in S47 mice.</p><p>We hypothesize that the more efficient metabolism and enhanced fitness provided by the S47 variant may have once provided carriers with a bio-energetic advantage in Sub-Saharan western Africa, where this variant is most common. For example, those carrying the S47 SNP may have possessed superior athletic prowess and/or ability to withstand famine (see model, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7</xref>). This metabolic advantage may explain the high frequency of this genetic variant in sub-Saharan Africa, despite the fact that it predisposes individuals to cancer later in life. Another positive selection for this variant in Africa may include an improved ability to withstand malaria infection: we recently reported that the S47 variant alters the immune micro-environment in mice and confers improved response to the malaria toxin hemozoin (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">Singh et al., 2020</xref>).</p><fig id="fig7" position="float"><label>Figure 7.</label><caption><title>Proposed model.</title><p>(<bold>A</bold>) Proposed model of how S47 contributes to increased metabolism. The elevated levels of GSH alter the redox state of the S47 cell, in turn affecting GAPDH conformation and impairing GAPDH-Rheb binding.

(<bold>B</bold>) Broad impact of S47 variant: although providing an adaptive advantage to individuals residing in sub-Saharan Africa at one point in time, it now predisposes modern humans with this SNP to cancer.</p></caption><graphic mime-subtype="tiff" mimetype="image" xlink:href="elife-55994-fig7-v1.tif"/></fig><p>Our findings provide further support for the growing premise that some tumor suppressor genetic variants may provide evolutionary selection benefit (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">Vicens and Posada, 2018</xref>). For example, women who carry the BRCA1/2 mutation exhibit increased size and enhanced fertility when compared to controls (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Smith et al., 2012</xref>). Similarly, people with Li Fraumeni syndrome who inherit germline mutations in <italic>TP53</italic>, as well as mice with tumor-derived germline mutations in <italic>Tp53</italic>, demonstrate increased fitness endurance (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib41">Wang et al., 2013</xref>); however, this is due to increased mitochondrial content, which we do not see in S47 cells. A common genetic variant in <italic>TP53</italic> at codon 72, encoding proline at amino acid 72, confers increased longevity while conversely causing increased cancer risk (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib47">Zhao et al., 2018</xref>). In contrast, the arginine 72 variant of p53 induces increased expression of LIF, which improves fecundity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Kang et al., 2009</xref>). The take home message from all these studies is that the diverse roles of tumor suppressor proteins like p53 in metabolism, fertility, and fitness may allow for positive selection for certain variants, even at the expense of increased cancer risk. In mice, this increased cancer risk occurs quite late in life, well past reproductive selection (12–18 months). More needs to be done to analyze cancer risk in S47 humans. A more comprehensive understanding of the function of tumor suppressor genetic variants, including the S47 SNP, will enable improved understanding of cancer risk, along with superior personalized medicine approaches, with the ultimate goal of improving clinical outcomes and survival of people who carry this variant.</p></sec><sec id="s4" sec-type="materials|methods"><title>Materials and

For the metabolic flux studies, cells were incubated in uniformly labeled <sup>13</sup>C-glucose (25 mM) as indicated in the figure legends. For intracellular extracts, after incubation, the culture medium was aspirated and cells were washed once in ice-cold PBS. Metabolites were extracted by adding a solution of methanol/acetonitrile/water (5:3:2) to the well. Plates were incubated at 4°C for 5 min on a rocker and then the extraction solution was collected. The metabolite extract was cleared by centrifuging at 15,000 x <italic>g</italic> for 10 min at 4°C. Supernatants were transferred to LC-MS silanized glass vials with PTFE caps and either run immediately on the LC-MS or stored at −80°C. LC-MS analysis was performed on a Q Exactive Hybrid Quadrupole-Orbitrap HF-X MS (ThermoFisher Scientific) equipped with a HESI II probe and coupled to a Vanquish Horizon UHPLC system (ThermoFisher Scientific). 0.002 ml of sample is injected and separated by HILIC chromatography on a ZIC-pHILIC 2.1 mm. Samples were separated by ammonium carbonate, 0.1% ammonium hydroxide, pH 9.2, and mobile phase B is acetonitrile. The LC was run at a flow rate of 0.2 ml/min and the gradient used was as follows: 0 min, 85% B; 2 min, 85% B; 17 min, 20% B; 17.1 min, 85% B; and 26 min, 85% B. The column was maintained at 45°C and the mobile phase was also pre-heated at 45°C before flowing into the column. The relevant MS parameters were as listed: sheath gas, 40; auxiliary gas, 10; sweep gas, 1; auxiliary gas heater temperature, 350°C; spray voltage, 3.5 kV for the positive mode and 3.2 kV for the negative mode. Capillary temperature was set at 325°C, and funnel RF level at 40. Samples were analyzed in full MS scan with polarity switching at scan range 65 to 975 m/z; 120,000 resolution; automated gain control (AGC) target of 1E6; and maximum injection time (max IT) of 100 milliseconds. Identification and quantitation of metabolites was performed using an annotated compound library and TraceFinder 4.1 software. The ‘M+X’ nomenclature refers to the isotopologue for that given metabolite. Isotopologues are chemically identical metabolites that differ only in their number of carbon-13 atoms. For instance, ‘M+two citrate’ means that two of the six carbons in citrate are carbon-13 while the other four are carbon-12. ‘M+four citrate’ means that four of the six carbons in citrate are carbon-13 while the other two are carbon-12. Isotopologue fractional labeling was corrected for carbon-13 natural abundance.</p></sec><sec id="s4-7"><title>GSH/GSSG abundance and BMH crosslinking</title><p>Relative GSH/GSSG abundance was measured using the GSH/GSSG-Glo Assay (Promega catalog #V6611), according to the manufacturer’s instruction.

Six-week-old mice were single caged, provided with water and food ad libitum and allowed to acclimate to the cages for 2 days. Oxygen consumption (VO<sub>2</sub>) and carbon dioxide production (VCO<sub>2</sub>) were recorded for 48 hr using an air flow of 600 ml/min and temperature of 22°C. Respiratory exchange ratio (RER) is calculated as VCO<sub>2</sub>/VO<sub>2</sub> and heat (kcal/h) is calculated by 3.815 + 1.232*(RER). Photodetectors were used to measure physical activity (Optovarimex System; Columbus Instruments).</p></sec><sec id="s4-11"><title>Treadmill and serum metabolite studies</title><p>Mice were allowed to acclimate to the metabolic treadmill (Columbus Instruments) for 5 min before beginning their runs. The treadmill was then set to 5 m/min and speed increased by 5 m/min every 2 min until 20 m/min was reached. Upon reaching 20 m/min, the incline was increased by 5° every 2 min until reaching a maximum of 25 degrees. Mice were allowed to run at this maximum speed and incline until exhaustion, defined by the mice spending 10 continuous seconds on the shock grid. Lactate (Nova Biomedical) and glucose (One Touch) measurements were taken using test strips just prior to treadmill entry and immediately after exhaustion using handheld meters. Tail blood was also taken prior to treadmill entry and immediately after exhaustion and metabolites measured using the Vettest serum analyzer (Idexx Laboratories).</p></sec><sec id="s4-12"><title>Statistical analysis</title><p>Unless otherwise stated, all experiments were performed in triplicate. The two-tailed unpaired Student t-test was performed. All in vitro data are reported as the mean ± SD unless stated otherwise, and in vivo are reported as the mean ± SE. Statistical analyses were performed using GraphPad Prism, p-values are as follows: (*) p-value&lt;0.05, (**) p-value&lt;0.01, (***) p-value&lt;0.001, (****) p-value&lt;0.0001. For the CLAMs and mouse exercise data, the Wilcoxon rank-sum test was used to compare the differences between S47 and WT mice.</p></sec></sec></body><back><ack id="ack"><title>Acknowledgements</title><p>This work was supported by R01 CA102184 (MEM), R01 CA139319 (DLG and MEM), R01 CA238611 (MEM), P01 CA114046 (DLG and MEM), T32 CA009071, F32 CA220972 and K99 CA241367 (TB), R01 CA174761 (KEW), R01 AG043483 and DK098656 (JAB) and the Rodent Metabolic Phenotyping Core (P30-DK19525), and DP2-CA249951 (ZTS).

cellular redox state. Being based on using both mouse and human tissues and cells containing an African-centric variant of p53, the work has direct implications for understanding cancer disparities in African-descent populations. This work suggests that enhanced mTOR activity and metabolic efficiency may have been selected for in early Africa, making this variant one of a growing number of cancer-predisposing variants.</p><p><bold>Decision letter after peer review:</bold></p><p>[Editors’ note: the authors submitted for reconsideration following the decision after peer review. What follows is the decision letter after the first round of review.]</p><p>Thank you for submitting your work entitled &quot;Increased mTOR activity and metabolic efficiency in mice and human cells containing the tumor-prone p53 variant Pro47Ser&quot; for consideration by <italic>eLife</italic>. Your article has been reviewed by three peer reviewers, one of whom is a member of our Board of Reviewing Editors, and the evaluation has been overseen by a Reviewing Editor and a Senior Editor. The following individuals involved in review of your submission have agreed to reveal their identity: Gina DeNicola (Reviewer #2).</p><p>This manuscript was reviewed by three experts in the field. While all three reviewers agreed that the findings were of considerable potential interest, all reviewers agreed that the manuscript in its current form did not reach the level of mechanistic depth required for publication in <italic>eLife</italic>. The reviewer consensus was that considerable additional experiments would be required and that these added experiments could not realistically be done in two months.</p><p>Specifically, the reviewers noted two major areas which would require additional experimentation. First, the link between the S47 variant of p53, GSH levels and mTOR activity required additional experiments and orthogonal approaches to validate the effect of p53 P47S on GSH levels and to connect altered GSH to mTORC1 activation. Second, further experiments are required to assess the degree to which the reported metabolic phenotypes arise as a consequence of increased mTORC1 activity. Given the length of time required to perform the recommended experiments, we are returning the manuscript and reviews to you so that they may guide you as you seek publication elsewhere. Should you wish to resubmit to <italic>eLife</italic> at a future date, we would be happy to reconsider a resubmission with increased mechanistic detail.</p><p><italic>Reviewer #1:</italic></p><p>In this manuscript, the authors present a metabolic characterization of cells and mice expressing the S47 variant of the tumor suppressor p53. S47 lines have increased basal mTOR activity, increased nutrient consumption and increased capacity for oxygen consumption. Mechanistically, the increase in mTOR activity is linked to alterations in GSH levels. in vivo, mice expressing S47 are bigger but do not consume more food or exhibit more activity. Nevertheless, these mice demonstrate increased capacity to respond to an exercise challenge. While the manuscript reports several interesting observations, how the various phenotypes relate to each other is unclear. While the link between p53, redox stress, and mTOR activity via alterations in GAPDH levels is a very interesting new mode of metabolic control by p53, several important experiments are required to strengthen this link.</p><p>Essential revisions:</p><p>1) The link between GSH levels and mTOR activity requires further confirmation. What do manipulations to intracellular GSH do to mTOR activity in S47 cells? Is increasing GSH, for example adding eGSH, sufficient to activate mTOR in WT cells? Is activation of mTOR downstream of altered cysteine regulation by the S47 variant? Would adding cell-permeable reduced cysteine in the form of N-acetylcysteine restore mTOR activity back to normal levels? Additionally, orthogonal validation of the changes in Rheb interactions following GSH manipulation, for example by co-IP, would further strengthen this point.</p><p>2) To what extent whole-body metabolic phenotypes are related to changes in mTOR activity is not addressed. In some cases, the phenotypes are not consistent with genetic manipulation of S6K, which increases organismal oxygen consumption and exercise capacity. There are many potential reasons why mice might perform differently in response to an exercise challenge: for example, altered muscle fiber type composition, among others. Furthermore, how the in vitro metabolic assays, showing increased nutrient consumption and increased oxygen consumption, relate to the in vivo phenotypes is not clear.</p><p><italic>Reviewer #2:</italic></p><p>In their manuscript &quot;Increased mTOR activity and metabolic efficiency in mice and human cells containing the tumor predisposing p53 variant Pro47Ser&quot;, Gnanapradeepan et al., describe an association between this variant and increased mTOR activity, oxidative mitochondrial metabolism, and metabolic efficiency. This finding is interesting and may serve to explain how this variant, found in sub-Saharan African populations, may confer fitness at the organismal level while concomitantly increasing cancer risk. Mechanistically, they propose that increased glutathione content in P47S cells promotes the association between mTOR and Rheb via an alteration in the redox state of GAPDH. However, this mechanism needs further development.</p><p>Essential revisions:</p><p>1) DEM is a non-specific alkylator of thiols, including those found in proteins. It is therefore not surprising that DEM would influence the mobility in BMH-treated samples. The authors should repeat this experiment with BSO. Further, as the authors have proposed SLC7A11 as the mediation of redox/GSH modulator, does erastin treatment produce the same effect?</p><p>2) The authors have not demonstrated a causal role for the altered redox state of GAPDH in the association between mTOR and Rheb. Can exogenous GSH (ester) and/or SLC7A11 overexpression influence mTOR signaling in WT cells? Can a GAPDH mutant that is insensitive to oxidation (C152S) influence the mTOR-Rheb interaction?</p><p>3) The authors do not show evidence that cysteine and GSH in are higher in S47 cells. Rather, they reference their previous study. When using compounds like DEM and BSO, evidence for efficacy in their current experiments is necessary. Further, GSH levels in mouse tissues should be included to support the link between mTOR signaling and GSH. Do only the mouse tissues with altered mTOR signaling have altered GSH?</p><p><italic>Reviewer #3:</italic></p><p>Gnanapradeepan et al., set out to dissect the metabolic outputs of a p53 variant (S47), present in African-descent populations and associated with increased cancer risk. Their previous work on the S47 variant affecting several negative regulators of mTORC1 signaling prompted them to examine mTORC1 signaling. Using both cell culture and their previously-reported S47 mouse model, the authors observe enhanced phosphorylation of mTORC1 substrate p-S6K1 in S47 cells and tissues, but no detectable changes in the phosphorylation of 4EBP1, another key substrate of mTORC1. Mechanistically, they attribute the enhanced mTORC1 activity to an increased mTOR-Rheb interaction, at the expense of Rheb-GAPDH interaction.</p><p>The authors then set out to determine the functional consequence of mTORC1 activity in metabolism and find several interesting metabolic phenotypes associated with the S47 variant, including increased glycolytic rate and OCR, enhanced muscle and body mass, and improved metabolic efficiency.</p><p>While some of the findings are interesting, it is unclear whether the changes in mTORC1 activity are connected to the observed metabolic phenotypes. Surprisingly, the authors have overlooked the well-known primary modes of regulation of mTORC1 activity (e.g., mTOR/Rheb localization at the lysosome, TSC phosphorylation, and AMPK signaling), but instead focus on the obscure GAPDH-Rheb-mTOR interaction, the contribution of which to mTORC1 activation is unclear and only reported under low-glucose conditions. More work is necessary to substantiate the authors' conclusions.</p><p>Essential revisions:</p><p>1) The metabolic phenotypes that the authors associate with mTORC1 signaling are based on correlative observations. The authors should attempt to rescue some of the observed phenotypes in Figure 2D, 2E, and Figure 6 using both allosteric (Rapamycin) and catalytic (Torin-1) inhibitors of mTORC1.</p><p>2) Figure 3: What are the authors' thoughts on Rapamycin failing to decrease OCR in S47 cells to the same extent as in WT cells? Is this due to partial inhibition of mTORC1 activity in these cells? Are the FKBP12 levels similar in these cells? Is ECAR dependent on mTORC1? The authors should also use a catalytic inhibitor of mTORC1 (e.g., Torin-1) and compare its effect to the effect of Rapamycin. It would be necessary to determine inhibition of mTORC1 signaling by these inhibitors on multiple substrates of mTORC1 (at least, S6K1 and 4EBP1) to be able to draw conclusions on this.</p><p>3) Figure 5: More work is needed to substantiate the mechanistic conclusions on increased mTORC1 activity in S47 cells because of an enhanced mTORC1-Rheb association and reduced GAPDH-Rheb. Using Proximity Ligation Assay (PLA) assays, the authors suggest that the Rheb-GAPDH association is dependent on the redox status of GAPDH, and in a reduced state as in S47, the GAPDH-Rheb interaction would decrease, allowing for more Rheb to associate with mTOR. While this is an interesting hypothesis, the authors should first validate the reagents used in their studies and employ orthogonal methods to verify these findings. The antibodies used for the PLA should be validated using knockdown experiments followed by PLA. Complementary experiments such as immunoprecipitation assays should be used to test the mTOR-Rheb and GAPDH-Rheb localization interaction changes in WT vs. S47 contexts.</p><p>4) Since the primary mode of activation of mTORC1 is at the lysosomes, the authors should test whether mTORC1, Rheb and TSC2 localization on the lysosomes is affected or not in the S47 cells. No conclusions regarding overactivation of mTORC1 in S47 cells can be made without this crucial bit of data.</p><p>5) Figure 2F, G and Figure 2—figure supplement 1A, B: The authors conclude a higher flux of glucose carbon into the TCA cycle in S47 cells. Why do the authors think that these minute changes (the differences appear to be less than 5%) are biologically significant? Can the authors observe significant changes in glycolytic intermediates in the 13C6-Glucose tracing experiment? Could the changes in OCR be due to an effect on NAD/NADH instead?</p><p>[Editors' note: further revisions were suggested prior to acceptance, as described below.]</p><p>Thank you for choosing to send your work entitled &quot;Increased mTOR activity and metabolic efficiency in mice and human cells containing the tumor-prone p53 variant Pro47Ser&quot; for consideration at <italic>eLife</italic>. Your letter of appeal has been considered by a Senior Editor along with a Reviewing Editor and the original manuscript reviewers, and we are prepared to consider a revised submission with no guarantees of acceptance.</p><p>All three reviewers agreed that the initial submission required extensive additional data to support the connection between p53 S47 and the GSH-GAPDH-Rheb-mTORC1 axis. Additionally, the reviewers believed while the in vivo data were quite interesting for the potential to provide an evolutionary explanation for the persistence of the p53 S47 polymorphism, these findings lacked mechanistic connection to the mTORC1 phenotypes reported in vitro.</p><p>All reviewers have now reviewed your outline for revision experiments and agree that these proposed experiments will likely go a long way to strengthening the link between p53 S47, GSH, and mTORC1 activity in vitro. However, because the GAPDH-Rheb-mTORC1 relationship is not a well-established mechanism for mTORC1 activation in the field (to date, there is only one report supporting this mechanism, which is proposed to occur under glucose deprived conditions), the authors will need to perform experiments both to address this hypothesis and rule out other, more canonical explanations for regulation of mTORC1 activity. One reviewer emphasized that experiments testing the effects of mTORC1 activation in response to amino acids, insulin, or glucose in WT vs S47 cells are needed to clarify the mechanism of regulation of mTORC1 (related to Figure 1F).</p><p>While all reviewers appreciated that in vivo experiments probing the relevance of mTORC1 activity to the in vivo phenotypes are challenging, in the absence of such experiments the in vivo metabolic phenotypes cannot be directly linked to mTORC1 activation. One reviewer suggested that ex vivo experiments could be used to address this point. For example, the authors could perform a Seahorse assay on muscle fibers, for which protocols from Agilent are available, and/or PLA/western blots after modulation of glutathione. Lacking such experiments, the animal phenotypes remain correlative and disconnected from the cell culture experiments, and the authors would need to revise the manuscript to ensure that the conclusions drawn from the in vitro data were separated from presentation of the in vivo data.</p><p>We will look forward to receiving a revised article and a file describing the changes made in response to the decision and review comments for further consideration. Of course, given the current circumstances, we do not expect a revised manuscript within two months. Instead we give you as much time as you need to submit a revised submission. Please be aware that the revision requirements outlined above, along with your response to these comments, will be published should your article be accepted for publication, subject to author approval.

Transient treatment with mTOR inhibitors elicits highly complex and often contrasting effects on energy expenditure and treadmill performance, likely due to the existence of feedback loops and the effect of inhibitors on multiple organ systems in the mouse. As just two examples: rapamycin has shown contrasting effects on energy expenditure in animals, depending on how long mice are treated (Fang et al., 2031); similarly, treatment of mice with rapamycin has shown limited impact on treadmill endurance, despite causing decreased expression of genes involved in mitochondrial biogenesis and oxidative phosphorylation in the muscle (Ye et al., 2013). Possibly the most consistent findings in the literature reflect the general consensus that mTORC1 is involved in mechanisms that drive increased muscle mass (Goodman, 2019) and that heightened mTOR activity leads to enhanced muscle recovery after exercise (Song er al., 2017; Yoon, 2017). It remains to be tested if these are the pathways affected in S47 mice.”</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Reviewer #2:</p><p>Essential revisions:</p><p>1) DEM is a non-specific alkylator of thiols, including those found in proteins.

We now show that pre-treatment of cells with BSO for 24 hours also causes the mobility of BMH-cross-linked GAPDH in S47 cells to ‘restore’ to the mobility in WT cells (new Figure 5—figure supplement 1A).

As indicated above (see similar comment 1 from reviewer 1), we now show that DEM (inactivates GSH), or a combination of DEM and glutamate (inhibits cystine import from the SLC7A11 transporter) markedly inhibits mTOR activity in S47 cells (new Figure 5B). We also show by IP-western that exogenous GSH decreases the Rheb-GAPDH complex in WT cells, while conversely, either DEM or BSO (the latter decreases GSH biosynthesis) increases the Rheb-GAPDH complex in S47 cells, while these treatments do not affect the steady state level of Rheb or GAPDH.

In new Figure 5A, we now show increased GSH:GSSG ratio in lung and skeletal muscle of S47 mice, compared to WT, and in S47 MEFs compared to WT. Further, in this figure, we show that the DEM successfully decreases these GSH:GSSG ratios in WT and S47 MEFs (new Figure 5A). With regard to the question “Do only the mouse tissues with altered mTOR signaling have altered GSH?”, we too wonder about this point and while our data in liver suggest this may be the case, we think it is premature to come to that conclusion. Therefore we state in the Discussion section that this is an open question: “We see evidence for increased mTOR activity only in certain tissues of the S47 mouse, so the metabolic impact of this genetic variant appears to be influenced by tissue type and cellular environment. At present we do not know if this tissue specificity is due to differences in GSH level, or to altered mTOR-Rheb or GAPDH-Rheb interactions in different tissues, or to other parameters.”</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Reviewer #3:</p><p>[…] While some of the findings are interesting, it is unclear whether the changes in mTORC1 activity are connected to the observed metabolic phenotypes.

We now show in supplemental data some of our cumulative data that the WT/S47 variation does not appear to impact p-AMPK or TSC2 levels or Rheb localization at the lysosome (Figure 4—figure supplement 1A, B and E). We have also clarified the text to this regard.</p><p>Importantly, we now also confirm in mouse skeletal muscle the major findings of Lee et al., 2009 in Supplemental figure 4- figure 1C, where we show that the Rheb-GAPDH interaction exists in skeletal muscle, and moreover that this interaction is regulated by glucose deprivation (as shown in cultured cells in Lee et al., 2009).

As requested, we have now performed the Seahorse experiments with Torin1 (new Figure 3C and D), and found that these data corroborate our findings with rapamycin. With regard to exercise studies, as described above in reviewer 1 point 1, we now clearly state:</p><p>“One caveat of this study, however, is that we do not directly demonstrate that the increased mTOR activity in S47 mice is causing their increased lean content or superior performance on treadmill assays. […] It remains to be tested if these are the pathways affected in S47 mice.”</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>2) Figure 3: What are the authors' thoughts on Rapamycin failing to decrease OCR in S47 cells to the same extent as in WT cells? Is this due to partial inhibition of mTORC1 activity in these cells? Are the FKBP12 levels similar in these cells? Is ECAR dependent on mTORC1? The authors should also use a catalytic inhibitor of mTORC1 (e.g., Torin-1) and compare its effect to the effect of Rapamycin. It would be necessary to determine inhibition of mTORC1 signaling by these inhibitors on multiple substrates of mTORC1 (at least, S6K1 and 4EBP1) to be able to draw conclusions on this.</p></disp-quote><p>As requested, we have used Torin1 and found similar effects to rapamycin; also as suggested by this Reviewer, we have performed a time course analysis on WT and S47 LCLs treated with Torin1 and rapamycin, and show that these agents appear comparable in their ability to inhibit markers of mTOR activity in WT and S47 cells (new Figure 3E; new Figure 3—figure supplement1A). We also show that very high concentrations of Torin1 (1 uM) are capable of fully inhibiting OCR in both WT and S47 LCLs (new Figure 3—figure supplement 1B). The combined data suggest that it is the sensitivity of OCR to mTOR inhibition, and not the ability of the drugs to inhibit mTOR, that is distinct between WT and S47 cells. We propose that there may be mTOR-independent effects of S47 on OCR.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>3) Figure 5: More work is needed to substantiate the mechanistic conclusions on increased mTORC1 activity in S47 cells because of an enhanced mTORC1-Rheb association and reduced GAPDH-Rheb. Using Proximity Ligation Assay (PLA) assays, the authors suggest that the Rheb-GAPDH association is dependent on the redox status of GAPDH, and in a reduced state as in S47, the GAPDH-Rheb interaction would decrease, allowing for more Rheb to associate with mTOR. While this is an interesting hypothesis, the authors should first validate the reagents used in their studies and employ orthogonal methods to verify these findings. The antibodies used for the PLA should be validated using knockdown experiments followed by PLA. Complementary experiments such as immunoprecipitation assays should be used to test the mTOR-Rheb and GAPDH-Rheb localization interaction changes in WT vs. S47 contexts.</p></disp-quote><p>These excellent points are very similar to reviewer 1 Essential revision #1, and we have taken them very seriously. These corroborative approaches have been done. Specifically:</p><p>a) We show that GSH impacts mTOR activity, as five hour treatment of cells with the GSH alkylator DEM, and more dramatically the combination of DEM with glutamate (inhibits cystine import), causes a significant decrease in mTOR activity in S47 cells (new Figure 5B).</p><p>b) Moreover, by IP-western we now show: exogenous GSH decreases the Rheb-GAPDH complex in WT cells, while conversely, either DEM or BSO (the latter decreases GSH biosynthesis) increases the Rheb-GAPDH complex in S47 cells, as shown by IP-western. These treatments do not affect the steady state level of Rheb or GAPDH. (New Figure 5D). We hope the reviewer agrees that these new data strengthen our conclusions, and again we are grateful for the suggestions.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>4) Since the primary mode of activation of mTORC1 is at the lysosomes, the authors should test whether mTORC1, Rheb and TSC2 localization on the lysosomes is affected or not in the S47 cells. No conclusions regarding overactivation of mTORC1 in S47 cells can be made without this crucial bit of data.</p></disp-quote><p>This has been done. We now show co-IF experiments for LAMP1-Rheb and Rheb-TSC2 and do not see differences between WT and S47 cells (see new Figure 4—figure supplement 1E).</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>5) Figure 2F, G and Figure 2—figure supplement 1A, B: The authors conclude a higher flux of glucose carbon into the TCA cycle in S47 cells. Why do the authors think that these minute changes (the differences appear to be less than 5%) are biologically significant? Can the authors observe significant changes in glycolytic intermediates in the 13C6-Glucose tracing experiment? Could the changes in OCR be due to an effect on NAD/NADH instead?</p></disp-quote><p>The metabolomics findings were modest, as they were performed after a 15 minute incubation with 13C-glucose. Unfortunately, due to quarantine our colleague was unable to repeat these findings using a longer timepoint in this experiment; therefore, we have moved these findings to Supplemental data. Similarly, we regret that we were unable due to time constraints to assess NAD/NADH levels and agree with this reviewer that this remains an interesting question to address.</p><p>[Editors' note: further revisions were suggested prior to acceptance, as described below.]</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>All reviewers have now reviewed your outline for revision experiments and agree that these proposed experiments will likely go a long way to strengthening the link between p53 S47, GSH, and mTORC1 activity in vitro. […] In this event you acknowledge and agree that the these will be published under the terms of the Creative Commons Attribution license.</p></disp-quote><p>We have addressed all of the concerns from the previous review, and the result is a greatly strengthened manuscript.</p><p>In sum, our work highlights a novel mechanism whereby the p53 tumor suppressor protein regulates mTOR activity, via the control of cellular redox state. Notably, this work uses as its foundation mouse and human tissues and cells containing an African-centric variant of p53, so the work has direct implications for understanding cancer disparities in African-descent populations. This work suggests that enhanced mTOR activity and metabolic efficiency may have been selected for in early Africa, making this variant one of a growing number of cancer-predisposing variants that possesses other activities that may be under positive selection. All of the authors have seen and approve this work.</p></body></sub-article></article>
