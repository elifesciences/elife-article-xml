mutation frequencies and mutation spectra associated with various intrinsic and environmental mutagens. In this study, by using a <italic>supF</italic> shuttle vector and non-SOS-induced <italic>Escherichia coli</italic> with short-read next-generation sequencing (NGS) technology, we present an advanced method for the study of mutations, which is simple, versatile, and cost-effective. We demonstrate the performance of our newly developed assay via pilot experiments with ultraviolet (UV) irradiation, the results from which emerge more relevant than expected. The NGS data obtained from samples of the indicator <italic>E. coli</italic> grown on titer plates provides mutation frequency and spectrum data, and uncovers obscure mutations that cannot be detected by a conventional <italic>supF</italic> assay. Furthermore, a very small amount of NGS data from selection plates reveals the almost full spectrum of mutations in each specimen and offers us a novel insight into the mechanisms of mutagenesis, despite them being considered already well known. We believe that the method presented here will contribute to future opportunities for research on mutagenesis, DNA repair, and cancer.</p></abstract><kwd-group kwd-group-type="author-keywords"><kwd>mutagenesis assay</kwd><kwd>NGS</kwd><kwd>supF</kwd><kwd>UV mutagenesis</kwd></kwd-group><kwd-group kwd-group-type="research-organism"><title>Research organism</title><kwd>None</kwd></kwd-group><funding-group><award-group id="fund1"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100001691</institution-id><institution>Japan Society for the Promotion of Science</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>JP 19K123222 and JP 22K12375</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Kawai</surname><given-names>Hidehiko</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><funding-statement>The funders had no role in study design, data collection and interpretation, or the decision to submit the work for publication.</funding-statement></funding-group><custom-meta-group><custom-meta specific-use="meta-only"><meta-name>Author impact statement</meta-name><meta-value>A sophisticated classical mutagenesis assay with next-generation sequencing technology presents a benefit to future research on mutagenesis, DNA repair, and cancer.</meta-value></custom-meta></custom-meta-group></article-meta></front><body><sec id="s1" sec-type="intro"><title>Introduction</title><p>In the last half century, various methods such as the Ames test and the micronucleus test have been employed as simple, sensitive, and reliable approaches for evaluation of the mutagenicity of chemicals and drugs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">OECD, 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib40">OECD, 2020</xref>). More recently, the technological advancement in science has allowed us, in addition to evaluation of mutagenicity, to address the distinct spectra of mutations produced by a broad range of intrinsic and environmental mutagens or anticancer drugs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">David, 2020</xref>). The mutational signatures extracted from these mutation spectra have provided valuable information about the role of endogenous and exogenous risk factors in the development of many human disorders and have been crucial in finding potential targets for treatment (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">Nik-Zainal et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Meier and Gartner, 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Koh et al., 2021</xref>).</p><p>Until the present day, a vast amount of diverse studies focused on the mechanisms of mutagenesis and DNA repair from the chemical, biochemical, and biological aspects have heavily relied on experimental strategies using cloned genes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib46">Razzaque et al., 1983</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Drinkwater and Klinedinst, 1986</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Gossen et al., 1989</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib64">White et al., 2019</xref>). One such widely used system is the SV40-based shuttle vector mutagenesis assay, which utilizes vector plasmids containing the <italic>supF</italic> gene of <italic>Escherichia coli</italic> and an indicator bacteria strain (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib41">Parris and Seidman, 1992</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib42">Parris et al., 1994</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib49">Sarkar et al., 1984</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib66">Yoon et al., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib61">Suzuki et al., 2022</xref>). The <italic>supF</italic> gene codes for an amber suppressor transfer RNA (tRNA) that translates the amber stop codon (UAG) to tyrosine (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Camakaris and Pittard, 1973</xref>). Depending upon the position and type of mutations in the <italic>supF</italic> gene, the <italic>supF</italic> tRNA cannot translate selectable marker genes with an amber mutation in its indicator <italic>E. coli</italic> strains, such as KS40/pOF105 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">Normanly et al., 1986</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">Obata et al., 1998</xref>). Because of its properties, the <italic>supF</italic> gene is particularly useful for acquiring mutation spectra and identifying mutation signatures, and provides reliable data on mutations generated by specific DNA lesions on the leading or the lagging template DNA strand via translesion synthesis (TLS) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Drinkwater and Klinedinst, 1986</xref>). However, one needs to be aware of the limitation of the phenotypic mutation spectrum of the <italic>supF</italic> gene; in our experiments for example, from the entire base sequence of the <italic>supF</italic> gene only about 30% can be detected for dual-antibiotic selection of indicator <italic>E. coli</italic>, that is, whether these sites can be identified or not is largely dependent on the experimental conditions, including the scale of the experiment, reporter genes for the selection, the mutagens used, the frequency of mutations, and the efficiency of the detection (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">Obata et al., 1998</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Kraemer and Seidman, 1989</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Fukushima et al., 2020</xref>). Recently, we reported the development of a new indicator <italic>E. coli</italic> strain â RF01, that is able to identify mutation spectra more efficiently than other strains used for the <italic>supF</italic> assay, even though it still does not allow the elucidation of trinucleotide mutational signatures because of the limited resolution of the mutation spectrum analysis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Fukushima et al., 2020</xref>).These limitations can be overcome by advanced techniques, namely next-generation sequencing (NGS), which over the last decade is enabling us to obtain various kinds of information from nucleic acid sequence data, including mutations and three-dimensional organization of the genomic DNA at a single cell level (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib55">Shendure et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Dutta et al., 2022</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Arrastia et al., 2022</xref>). On the other hand, the NGS technology also has its limitations, especially for identification and quantification of low-frequency mutations, as it can be difficult to distinguish true mutations from the baseline errors of NGS. In recent years, in order to detect low-frequency mutations, numerous library construction methods and sequencing methods have been developed, such as maximum depth sequencing or duplex sequencing (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib50">Schmitt et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Jee et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib56">Sloan et al., 2018</xref>). For every scientific objective, trade-offs between accuracy, cost, and speed of the multiple available approaches must be carefully considered. Importantly, there is a scarcity of methods whose technical simplicity and material availability enables any researchers, not only those specialized in NGS, to accumulate, reproduce, and compare data across research fields. Certainly, the availability of an easy, low-cost assay for accurate analysis of mutational signatures would benefit many laboratories who are deterred by the complexity of the existing methods.</p><p>In this study, we attempt to develop a simple mutagenesis assay using a random 12-nucleotide (12-nt) DNA-barcoded <italic>supF</italic> shuttle vector library with non-SOS-induced <italic>E. coli</italic> which can amplify the DNA with âa high-fidelity replication mechanismâ as a template for the NGS sample preparation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">Napolitano et al., 1997</xref>). This promotes cost-benefit, high-throughput, and high accuracy with almost no sequencing errors. In the first part, we present data from the multiplexed NGS assay utilizing the barcoded <italic>supF</italic> shuttle vector library and the BGI-platform that uses the rolling circle replication method, and we compare the results for different conditions of sample preparation. In the later part of this study, we present analysis of UV radiation-induced mutations in direct <italic>E. coli</italic> experiments or after transfection into mammalian cells, as an example of the performance of our newly developed assay. UV radiation is a known environmental carcinogen and causes a characteristic mutational pattern via the formation of pyrimidine-pyrimidine dimers (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib62">Varghese and Wang, 1967</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Mao et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Lindberg et al., 2019</xref>). The C to T transition at C<underline>C</underline>N and T<underline>C</underline>N trinucleotide sites (the mutated base is underlined) is a mutational signature highly specific to UV-mediated mutagenesis (mutational COSMIC signatures SBS7a-d) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Alexandrov et al., 2020</xref>). The cytosine in UV-induced pyrimidine-pyrimidine dimers undergoes deamination to uracil, followed by insertion of an A nucleotide opposite the lesion by error-prone TLS polymerases (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib44">Pfeifer et al., 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Ikehata and Ono, 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib47">Roberts and Gordenin, 2014</xref>). The substantial amount of sequence data on UV-induced mutations in mammalian cells obtained in this study allowed us to uncover some insightful information about UV-induced mutagenesis, underscoring the importance of a systematic process for sufficient data collection and analysis. We believe that our new approach using the barcoded <italic>supF</italic> shuttle vector library and NGS technology presents a benefit to future research on mutagenesis, DNA repair, and cancer.</p></sec><sec id="s2" sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><sec id="s2-1"><title>Construction of barcoded <italic>supF</italic> shuttle vector libraries for NGS assay</title><p>Aiming to develop a more advanced and versatile assay system suitable for a wide range of mutagenesis studies, we attempted to apply a short-read NGS platform with multiplex sample preparation to the conventional <italic>supF</italic> mutagenesis assay. At first, we constructed a series of <italic>supF</italic> shuttle vector plasmids, named pNGS2-K1-4 or -A1-4 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1âfigure supplement 1</xref>). Each plasmid carries all regions depicted for pNGS-K1 or A1 in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1A</xref>, including an antibiotic resistance gene for either kanamycin (<italic>km<sup>r</sup></italic>) or ampicillin (<italic>amp<sup>r</sup></italic>). Different orientations of the <italic>supF</italic> gene and the M13 intergenic region were utilized for the purposes of individual experiments, such as the detection of specific types and sites of DNA damage (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib59">Suzuki et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib60">Suzuki et al., 2021</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib61">Suzuki et al., 2022</xref>). To investigate both mutation frequencies and profiles as precisely as possible, <italic>supF</italic> shuttle vector libraries containing random 12-nt (N<sub>12</sub>) barcode sequences (N<sub>12</sub>-BC <italic>supF</italic> library) were generated from pNGS2 to be used for NGS analysis. An easy and reliable method to construct N<sub>12</sub>-BC <italic>supF</italic> libraries with sufficient complexity by using single-stranded DNA was developed in this study, as is described in detail in the Materials and methods section. To prepare the samples for NGS analysis, a region from the N<sub>12</sub>-BC <italic>supF</italic> library (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1B</xref>) was amplified by PCR by using the indicated primer sets (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="fig1sdata1">Figure 1âsource data 1</xref>). We opted to use PCR amplification instead of acoustic shearing by ultrasound, in order to avoid inducing oxidative damage to the DNA (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Foox et al., 2021</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib45">Pugh et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Ma et al., 2019</xref>). Also, each primer pair for PCR amplification contains in one of the primers a pre-designed 6-nt index sequence (N<sub>6</sub>) for multiplexed NGS assay, which is used for classification of independent samples in every NGS run. The independently amplified PCR products for each sample were purified and combined in the proper proportion, after which they were subjected to multiplexed deep sequencing in 200 bp paired-end mode on the NGS using a BGISEQ platform (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Foox et al., 2021</xref>). We have also carried out several pilot experiments using 150 bp paired-end mode and/or Illumina platform, which confirmed that these modalities can also be successfully employed for the assay. The procedure for the <italic>supF</italic> mutagenesis NGS assay in this study is illustrated in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1C</xref>. Depending on the purpose and the design of each experiment, the N<sub>12</sub>-BC <italic>supF</italic> library or cells can be treated with mutagens, and any or all of the libraries (i)â(iv) in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1C</xref> can be subjected to NGS analysis.</p><fig-group><fig id="fig1" position="float"><label>Figure 1.</label><caption><title>Strategy for the <italic>supF</italic> mutagenicity next-generation sequencing (NGS) assay.</title><p>(<bold>A</bold>) Schematic map of the shuttle vector pNGS2-K1 or -A1.

The background <italic>supF</italic> mutant frequency of each library was first checked by the conventional <italic>supF</italic> assay, and was confirmed to be ~10<sup>â5</sup>, indicating that there was no <italic>supF</italic> phenotypic mutation in the libraries. After that, different amounts of PCR template (1.0, 3.3, 10, 33, or 100 ng of the N<sub>12</sub>-BC <italic>supF</italic> library) were used for PCR amplification and analyzed by NGS, as described in the Materials and methods section. The PCR products were purified and mixed in the optimal ratio so that NGS analysis yields approximately 200â250 reads per barcode sequence. The N<sub>12</sub>-BC sequences for each sample were error-corrected based on a whitelist (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib57">Smith et al., 2017</xref>), and classified by the identical N<sub>12</sub>-BC sequence. The number of unique N<sub>12</sub>-BC sequences in each library is shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2A</xref> (left-side graph in each pair of bar plots). The number of identified unique N<sub>12</sub>-BC sequences was 117â119 for Lib10<sup>2</sup>_#1, 97 for Lib10<sup>2</sup>_#2, 1421â1426 for Lib10<sup>3</sup>, and 13125â13172 for Lib10<sup>4</sup>, very close to the estimation based on the number of colonies used to prepare each library. The number of reads was also within the expected range, and comparable at different amounts of PCR template (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2A</xref>, right-side graph in each pair of bar plots).

To produce different numbers of characteristic DNA lesions, the libraries were irradiated with UV-C at 0, 50, 100, 200 J/m<sup>2</sup>, and then directly transformed into the indicator <italic>E. coli</italic> strain RF01 which is derived from <italic>E. coli</italic> KS40 under non-SOS-induced conditions (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">Napolitano et al., 1997</xref>). The RF01 transformed with irradiated or non-irradiated libraries were diluted and plated on LB plates with or without antibiotics (selection or titer plates, respectively), as for a conventional <italic>supF</italic> assay. As expected, the number of RF01 colonies on the titer plates was obviously decreased by UV irradiation in a dose-dependent manner (the average number of colonies per ng of the N<sub>12</sub>-BC 10<sup>4</sup> library, from three experiments, were 5.0Ã10<sup>6</sup> for 0 J/m<sup>2</sup>, 3.6Ã10<sup>6</sup> for 50 J/m<sup>2</sup>, 1.7Ã10<sup>6</sup> for 100 J/m<sup>2</sup>, and 3.5Ã10<sup>4</sup> for 200 J/m<sup>2</sup>), and on the selection plates containing nalidixic acid and streptomycin the mutant frequencies were in the order of 10<sup>â4</sup> to 10<sup>â5</sup>. Approximately 10,000 colonies of RF01 transformed with N<sub>12</sub>-BC <italic>supF</italic> libraries were harvested from one to three titer plates, libraries were extracted, and approximately 400 Mb per sample were analyzed by NGS. The number of N<sub>12</sub>-BC sequences shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4A</xref> were identified as unique N<sub>12</sub>-BC sequences, indicating that even though some N<sub>12</sub>-BC sequences were overlapping between colonies, the majority were not. The number of N<sub>12</sub>-BC sequences with a variant and VF 0.4â1.0, as well as their distribution in the analyzed region (positions â67 to 214) are shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4B</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s1">Figure 4âfigure supplement 1</xref>, respectively. The mutations seem to be evenly distributed, except for the region around the 12-nt barcoding site. This data suggests that all of the variants in non-irradiated samples were derived from the barcoding process with the custom-synthesized N<sub>12</sub> oligonucleotides during the N<sub>12</sub>-BC library construction, and the number of N<sub>12</sub>-BC sequences with a variant in the <italic>supF</italic> gene was slightly increased by UV irradiation in a dose-dependent fashion. When the N<sub>12</sub>-BC sequences with a variant were classified according to nucleotide position along the line of position â20, near the start site of the <italic>supF</italic> gene (position â15 is the first nucleotide of the promoter), it is evident that there were no variant calls in the region of the <italic>supF</italic> gene in the non-irradiated library (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4C and D</xref>). The major type of variant sequences identified by variant calls in the irradiated libraries were SNS (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4C and E</xref>). Also, more than 80% of the SNSs consisted of G:C to A:T transitions (largest proportion) and G:C to C:G transversions (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4F</xref>). The mutation frequency for the <italic>supF</italic> gene was calculated as the ratio between the number of variant sequences and the total number of analyzed N<sub>12</sub>-BC sequences (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4G</xref>). For comparison, the <italic>supF</italic> mutant frequency was also determined by the conventional <italic>supF</italic> assay, as the number of colonies on selection plates versus that on titer plates (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4H</xref>). The results from the two methods exhibit very similar trends of mutation frequency increasing in a UV-dose-dependent fashion, yet the <italic>supF</italic> mutation frequencies calculated from the NGS data were about 20 times higher than those determined by the conventional <italic>supF</italic> assay. The possible reasons for this discrepancy are the following: (1) a <italic>supF</italic> gene containing a UV-damaged non-transcribed strand and a non-damaged transcribed strand confers a nalidixic acid and streptomycin-sensitive phenotype in individual colonies of RF01 due to the wild-type <italic>supF</italic> tRNA expression; (2) there is a selection bias due to âsilent mutationsâ or âphenotypic differencesâ in the mutant phenotype of the <italic>supF</italic> gene, depending on either nucleotide positions or the substituted bases (for instance, positions 21â60 of the <italic>supF</italic> gene correspond to the pre-tRNA sequence); (3) a plasmid may contain several mutations at different positions.</p><p>In order to investigate in more detail the SNS mutation spectrum, all possible 192 trinucleotide contexts of mutations from the titer plates were compared between the complementary DNA strands.

The G:C to A:T transitions were very rarely detected, indicating that the high fidelity DNA polymerase with no TLS activity used in the PCR process cannot replicate DNA and produce mutations in the presence of lesions generated by UV irradiation, such as cyclobutane pyrimidine dimers (CPDs) or pyrimidine(6â4)pyrimidone photoproducts (6â4PPs).</p><fig id="fig5" position="float"><label>Figure 5.</label><caption><title>The 192 trinucleotide contexts of ultraviolet (UV) radiation-induced single nucleotide substitutions (SNSs) in bacterial cells (data from titer plates).</title><p>UV radiation-induced SNSs shown in 192 trinucleotide contexts for the non-transcribed (top panel) and transcribed (bottom panel) strand of the <italic>supF</italic> gene (nucleotide positions from â19 to 214).

The libraries were purified from the collected pellet of <italic>E. coli</italic> and analyzed as described above for the titer plates (16 Mb per sample were analyzed). Again, the number of detected N<sub>12</sub>-BC sequences were almost equal to the number of harvested colonies, and a limited number of N<sub>12</sub>-BC sequences (~2%) contained more than one variant sequence (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6A</xref>).

Approximately, from 4000 to 7000 N<sub>12</sub>-BC sequences were identified per sample from around 10,000 colonies transformed with libraries from U2OS cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8">Figure 8A</xref>). A significant dose-dependent increase was observed in the number of N<sub>12</sub>-BC sequences with variant calls, and higher number of variant sequences were obtained from the same number of colonies compared to directly transformed with the libraries <italic>E. coli</italic> (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8">Figure 8B</xref> versus <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4B</xref>).

As shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8">Figure 8E</xref>, the major type of variant sequences was SNSs, which is the expected UV-induced mutation signature, and this observation was the same as in directly <italic>E. coli</italic> experiments. However, in the U2OS cells experiment, the percentages of both DNSs and insertions at deletion sites (Del-ins) were increased in a dose-dependent manner. As will be described later, most of the variant sequences detected as Del-in by VarDict were triplet mutations, which are known UV-specific mutations and are defined as multiple base substitutions within a 3-nt sequence containing at least one dipyrimidine.

Again, the results exhibit a very similar trend of a dose-dependent increase, and predictably, the <italic>supF</italic> mutation frequencies calculated from NGS data were about 15 times higher than those determined by the conventional assay. As in the direct <italic>E. coli</italic> experiments (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5</xref>), the SNS mutation spectra were compared between the complementary DNA strands (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig9">Figure 9</xref>).

Contrary to the direct <italic>E. coli</italic> experiments (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6A</xref>), approximately 1000 colonies were yielded for each sample from selection plates, even in the non-irradiated condition. As shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig10">Figure 10A</xref>, in spite of the fact that the samples for all UV doses were prepared from almost the same number of colonies (1000), the identified number of N<sub>12</sub>-BC sequences was less than 1000 and showed an increase in a dose-dependent manner, approaching 1000 only at 200 J/m<sup>2</sup>. This result indicates that the classified number of N<sub>12</sub>-BC sequences with variant sequence(s) were already saturated for the samples irradiated at doses of 0, 50, and 100 J/m<sup>2</sup>. Even if more colonies were obtained from a larger number of plates, the same overlapping N<sub>12</sub>-BC sequences with variant(s) would be identified. In other words, almost all variant sequences were already detected at doses lower than 200 J/m<sup>2</sup>, as long as the indicator <italic>E. coli</italic> transformed with the libraries could form a colony and the sample could be amplified by the PCR procedure. Moreover, the dose dependency of the discrepancy between the numbers of N<sub>12</sub>-BC sequences and the number of variant sequences indicates that multiple mutations in the same read were produced. The number of mutations per N<sub>12</sub>-BC sequence is shown by a horizontal stacked bar graph in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig10">Figure 10B</xref>, and it can be seen that the proportion of N<sub>12</sub>-BC sequences with multiple mutations was slightly increased in a dose-dependent manner. The positions and types of mutations plotted in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig10">Figure 10C</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig10s1">Figure 10âfigure supplement 1</xref> reveal that the overall results were very similar to those from <italic>E. coli</italic> directly transformed with N<sub>12</sub>-BC <italic>supF</italic> libraries (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6B</xref>), the reasons for which are associated with the properties of the <italic>supF</italic> gene and UV-induced DNA lesions. Regarding the proportion of mutation types and SNSs, the data from selection plates (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig10">Figure 10D and E</xref>) exhibited a trend similar to the data from titer plates (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8">Figure 8E and F</xref>). In contrast, as shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig11">Figure 11</xref>, as in the case of <italic>E. coli</italic> directly transformed with libraries and grown on selection plates, the trinucleotide mutation patterns obviously differed between the non-transcribed and transcribed strand of the <italic>supF</italic> gene. Although the trinucleotide mutation patterns were observed to be biased between the strands, this is assumingly due to the phenotypic variability among the mutation types and mutation sites in the <italic>supF</italic> gene. The combined data of the trinucleotide substitution patterns from both strands becomes similar to that from the titer plates. Remarkably, the substantial amount of data on mutation spectra that we obtained had led to a better appreciation of the fact that UV-induced DNA lesions had resulted in mutation clusters with a significant strand bias. As mentioned above, the rates of N<sub>12</sub>-BC sequences with multiple mutations were increased in a UV dose-dependent fashion (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig10">Figure 10A and B</xref>), therefore we next focused on the correlation between the numbers, types, positions, and mutated bases for each mutation. At first, the N<sub>12</sub>-BC sequences were classified as containing a single mutation versus two or more mutations, and N<sub>12</sub>-BC sequences in each category were classified by the type of mutations they contained (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig12">Figure 12A</xref>). The total number of N<sub>12</sub>-BC sequences with mutations is indicated in brackets. If an N<sub>12</sub>-BC sequence contained one mutation, the proportion of mutations classified as Del-ins or SNSs from cytosine sites were increased in a dose-dependent manner. On the other hand, if an N<sub>12</sub>-BC sequence contained more than one mutation, the mutations classified as DNSs and SNSs from guanine sites were increased. Then, the N<sub>12</sub>-BC sequences were classified as containing 1 to 4~ mutations per sequence, and depicted in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig12s1">Figure 12âfigure supplement 1</xref>, where the mutations are shown according to their nucleotide positions. It can be seen that if an N<sub>12</sub>-BC sequence contained one mutation, especially in the case of SNSs, the mutations were detected at relatively specific sites that can be considered as sites responsible for <italic>supF</italic> mutation phenotype. On the other hand, if an N<sub>12</sub>-BC sequence contained more than one mutation, the mutations were relatively sparsely distributed. In both cases, SNSs were predominantly substituted from either C or G. This result may suggest that the DNA lesions produced by UV irradiation at cytosine sites on the same strand of the DNA molecule produce multiple mutations simultaneously at the first replication cycle.</p><fig-group><fig id="fig10" position="float"><label>Figure 10.</label><caption><title>Performance of the <italic>supF</italic> mutagenicity next-generation sequencing (NGS) assay in mammalian cells (data from selection plates).</title><p>The data represents RF01 transformed with libraries extracted from transfected U2OS cells.

In the case of single SNSs (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig12">Figure 12B</xref>, graph on top), G to A was the most frequent and C to T was the second most frequent substitution, which may be associated with the number of G bases (18 sites) and C bases (14 sites) in the strand of the <italic>supF</italic> gene responsible for the selection phenotype (refer to Figure 14A). On the other hand, in the case of multiple SNSs per N<sub>12</sub>-BC sequence (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig12">Figure 12B</xref>, bottom graph), C to T was the most frequent and G to A was the second most frequent, which may be associated with the number of G bases (56 sites) and C bases (70 sites), GA (13 sites) or TC (18 sites) in the non-transcribed strand of the <italic>supF</italic> gene (refer to Figure 14A and B ). The number of N<sub>12</sub>-BC sequences with other types of single mutations are shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig12">Figure 12C</xref>, where a clear UV dose-dependent increase can be seen in the number of 1-nt deletions, DNSs, and Del-ins, but not in the number of large deletions and insertions. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig12">Figure 12D and E</xref> represents the most frequent mutation sequences for DNS and Del-in mutations, respectively. The DNSs were gradually increased in a dose-dependent manner and seem to be saturated at a dose of 200 J/m<sup>2</sup>; also, they seem to mainly result from <underline>GG:CC</underline> to <underline>AA:TT</underline> transition in at least tetra-nucleotide repeats of C or T at several distinct positions in the gene (refer to Figure 14C). On the other hand, in the case of Del-ins, the mutations increased at higher doses and were the result of <underline>G</underline>A<underline>G:C</underline>T<underline>C</underline> to <underline>A</underline>A<underline>A:T</underline>T<underline>T</underline> transitions, also at distinct positions (refer to Figure 14D ). These triplet mutations may be generated from UV photolesions at TC dipyrimidine sites by error-prone TLS polymerases such as polÎ¶ and polÎº. In addition, in the non-irradiated samples the Del-in mutations were peculiarly different from those in the irradiated samples and were detected as <underline>T</underline>T<underline>G</underline>A<underline>T</underline> to <underline>A</underline>T<underline>C</underline>A<underline>A</underline>. This TTGAT penta-nucleotide sequence located in the potential hairpin loop of a quasi-palindromic sequence, <named-content content-type="sequence">GGCGCGTCATTTGATATGATGCGCC</named-content>, may lead to template switching and give rise to complementary cluster mutations (refer to Figure 14E).</p><p>Next, we focused on the multiple mutations (more than one mutation in the same N<sub>12</sub>-BC sequence) in terms of their combinations and mutation spectra. The multiple mutations were classified by their combinations and depicted for each UV dose in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig12s2">Figure 12âfigure supplement 2</xref>. The comparison between the spectra of the single and multiple mutations for the sample irradiated with 200 J/m<sup>2</sup> was summarized in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig13">Figure 13</xref> (single mutation per N<sub>12</sub>-BC â <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig13">Figure 13</xref>, bottom part; more than one mutation per N<sub>12</sub>-BC â <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig13">Figure 13</xref>, top and center-left part) and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig13s1">Figure 13âfigure supplement 1</xref>. It is obvious that there is a consensus for multiple mutations in a single N<sub>12</sub>-BC sequence as follows: (1) In the non-irradiated samples the mutations were by a large majority SNSs, all of them either from C or G (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig12s2">Figure 12âfigure supplement 2</xref>). (2) In the UV-irradiated samples all combinations of more than two mutations in a single N<sub>12</sub>-BC sequence were increased in a dose-dependent manner, except for those composed only of substitutions from A and T. (3) As for the Del-in and DNS mutations, if they contained C to T substitutions, the other mutation(s) were mainly C to T SNSs, and if they contained G to A substitutions, the other mutations were mainly G to A SNSs (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig13s1">Figure 13âfigure supplement 1</xref>). (4) The number of N<sub>12</sub>-BC sequences with multiple mutations including a mutation from C was higher than those including a mutation from G, same as the trend for multiple SNS mutations shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig12">Figure 12B</xref>. (5) The distance between two SNSs in multiple mutations induced by UV irradiation was relatively shorter than the theoretically expected based on the sequence (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig13s2">Figure 13âfigure supplements 2</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig13s3">3</xref>).</p><fig-group><fig id="fig13" position="float"><label>Figure 13.</label><caption><title>Numbers and combinations of detected mutations per N<sub>12</sub>-BC in mammalian cells (data from selection plates, 200 J/m<sup>2</sup>).</title><p>The numbers of detected mutations for each single mutation per N<sub>12</sub>-BC (lower part) and for combinations of more than one mutations per N<sub>12</sub>-BC (upper and middle part) are shown by stacked thin horizontal bars.

This conventional <italic>supF</italic> assay is very useful for analysis of both mutation frequencies and mutation spectra. The mutation spectra of single or tandem base substitutions for inactive <italic>supF</italic> genes identified by using the blue-white colony color assays were comprehensively summarized in an earlier review article, and it was noted that the mutations were detected at 86 sites within a 158 bp region covering the <italic>supF</italic> gene (54%) and at 74 sites within the 85 bp mature tRNA region (87%), thus demonstrating the great sensitivity of the <italic>supF</italic> assay system for analysis of mutation spectra (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Kraemer and Seidman, 1989</xref>). However, obtaining reliable datasets by the conventional <italic>supF</italic> assay requires skill and experience, especially for studies where the mutations of interest are induced with low frequency. The method has been advanced by the construction of indicator bacterial strains with different <italic>supF</italic> reporter genes which allow selection based on survival of bacteria containing mutant <italic>supF</italic> genes. However, the fact that the <italic>supF</italic> phenotypic selection process relies on the structure and function of transfer RNAs that may be differently affected by different mutations means that the improvement of the efficiency of the selection process may cause loss of coverage of the mutation spectra, as it is under our experimental conditions, where the coverage is about 30% (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Kraemer and Seidman, 1989</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Fukushima et al., 2020</xref>). Since in recent years NGS has become a routine research tool due to its lowering cost, numerous sophisticated applications of NGS technologies are being developed for research in genomics, epigenomics, and transcriptomics (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">McCombie et al., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib63">Wang et al., 2016</xref>). In this study, we attempted to combine the <italic>supF</italic> shuttle vector forward mutagenesis assay with sequencing analysis by a short-read NGS platform and consequently developed a novel <italic>supF</italic> NGS assay with potential application in mutagenesis and DNA repair studies. The combination of the DNA-barcoded <italic>supF</italic> shuttle vector library and its amplification via in vivo replication in the indicator non-SOS <italic>E. coli</italic> provides us with proper templates for the PCR-facilitated preparation of multiplexed NGS samples. Thus, during the PCR process the amplification and index tagging of the samples are achieved simultaneously. Designed in such a way, the assay allows us to obtain almost all mutation sequences from a small amount of data from NGS reads, especially in samples from colonies grown on selection plates, where the mutation sequences, although prone to bias, are highly concentrated. This results in the possibility to simultaneously analyze hundreds of samples from different experiments in a single NGS run. Here, the cost of mutation spectrum analysis from selection plates was less than $1.00 per sample, even though both the NGS library preparation and the NGS run were outsourced. Further cost reductions can be expected by obtaining more sequencing data in a single run, and also from the continuous improvement of NGS technologies. From this point of view, we believe that we can secure a sufficient number of experiments to improve the accuracy of the analysis and to confirm the reproducibility of the experiments. Furthermore, the data from colonies grown on titer plates provides us, at least in principle, and with the exception of large deletions and insertions, with non-biased mutation spectra for the whole analyzed region. Also, mutation frequencies calculated from titer plate data were 15â20 times higher than those obtained by the conventional <italic>supF</italic> assay, demonstrating that our novel assay allows us to analyze more thoroughly the mutation spectrum by using a smaller amount of data and to detect mutations with lower frequencies. The analysis of data from both selection and titer plates is consistent with the desired reliability and low cost of the mutagenesis assay. Last but not least, by using the <italic>supF</italic> shuttle vector plasmid, mutation spectrum data can be obtained with different experimental designs, such as pre-treatment with metabolic enzymes or using cells with different genetic backgrounds, siRNA transfection, CRISPR-Cas systems, etc. We are currently conducting experiments with an <italic>supF</italic> library containing site-specific single DNA damages such as 8-oxo-7,8-dihydroguanine (8-oxoG, 8-hydroxyguanine) among others (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib59">Suzuki et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib60">Suzuki et al., 2021</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib61">Suzuki et al., 2022</xref>), which will allow us to analyze in detail the repair mechanisms of sequence-specific DNA damage and provide further insights into mutagenesis and DNA repair processes.</p><p>The current study posits that when performing the assay, we have to be aware of the following points: (1) The required barcode complexity defined by the number of barcode sequences in the <italic>supF</italic> shuttle vector library depends on the experimental purpose and the mutation detection frequencies. A barcode complexity of 1.0Ã10<sup>4</sup> for each library is used as the standard in this paper. Even though more complexity may be able to provide better results, especially at lower mutation frequencies, one must keep in mind that the number of colonies to be harvested for the NGS sample preparation, as well as the platform or setting for data analysis, need to be adjusted depending on the number of barcodes. (2) The number of NGS reads required for each multiplexed sample and for each N<sub>12</sub>-BC sequence need to be calculated before the preparation of the samples. Therefore, the number of N<sub>12</sub>-BC sequences and the number of harvested colonies must be optimized first. In addition, the allele frequency given by VarDict, referred to as VF in this study, for each classified N<sub>12</sub>-BC sequence is the most important determinant of the quality of the variant sequence data and the basis for analyzing overlapping N<sub>12</sub>-BC sequences. The cost, time, and data quality must be all well considered and balanced when an experiment is designed. (3) NGS data contain sequencing errors, the rate of which is known to be between 10<sup>â3</sup> and 10<sup>â4</sup>, with the majority of the errors being A:Tâ to G:C and G:CâtoâA:T transitions that had occurred during the PCR in the process of NGS library preparation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Brodin et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Costello et al., 2013</xref>). In the assay presented here no sonication step is required, thus avoiding DNA oxidation. As already mentioned, the clonal amplification of the <italic>supF</italic> shuttle vector via in vivo replication in the non-SOS <italic>E. coli</italic> provides a proper PCR template for preparation of NGS samples. In addition, the sequence alignment to the reference sequence for all identical N<sub>12</sub>-BC sequences and the analysis of data obtained from duplicate PCR reactions can almost completely eliminate the sequencing errors resulting from the process of sample preparation. On the other hand, in the case of the amplicon sequencing employed here, the base-calling errors occurred depending on the âper base sequence qualityâ of the specific sequence. In this study, in addition to the <italic>supF</italic> gene with its total length of 335 bp being sequenced, 200 bp paired-end sequencing was performed with about 30 bp overlapping sequences, and the resulting sequence was merged together. The âper base sequence qualityâ in the region between read positions 160 and 200 bp is relatively low compared to other positions. Data shown in this study, as well as other experiments conducted in our laboratory, reveals that two positions in particular â 55 and 69 in the <italic>supF</italic> gene manifest a very high frequency of variant calls â 20â50% of samples, but with low VF (less than 0.3). These two positions are located at 165â167 (depending on the N<sub>0</sub>, N<sub>1</sub>, N<sub>2</sub> primers) and 181â183 bp from the end of the forward reads, and at 179â181 and 167â169 bp from the end of the reverse reads. The addition of different numbers of random nucleotides â 0-, 1-, or 2-nt at the end of both primers used for sample preparation can contribute to better âper base sequence qualityâ in clonal amplicon sequencing. However, positions 55 and 69 are located immediately next to CC:GG sequences (position 55 is located in TT<underline>A</underline>CC:GG<underline>T</underline>AA and position 69 is located in GT<underline>T</underline>CC:GG<underline>A</underline>AC), and the result of variant calling was almost exclusively SNS from 55A:T or 69T:A to C:G. Thus, these variant calls appear to be position-specific and sequence-dependent, and for this assay can be regarded as position-specific base-calling errors. Since they had a VF of less than 0.3 and a threshold VF of 0.4 was applied in this study, these base-calling errors do not need to be given consideration. Nevertheless, it must be emphasized that fine-tuning must be done for each individual experiment. (4) Large alterations in the <italic>supF</italic> gene, such as a large deletion or insertion, cannot be analyzed by this assay because of impossibility for PCR amplification or read alignments. This may render our observations on mutation frequency misleading. The frequency of such large alterations is better assessed by colony PCR, especially if the number of colonies grown on the titer plates was different from expected. (5) For the <italic>supF</italic> assay, spontaneous cluster mutations at TC:GA sites were often observed, and it was well illustrated in an earlier study that a nick in the shuttle vector was a trigger for these asymmetric cluster mutations (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib52">Seidman et al., 1987</xref>). Therefore, we need to be aware of the quality of each library and how it affects the outcome of each analysis, especially for detection of very low levels of mutations. Depending on the purpose of the experiments, in the preparation of covalently closed circular vector libraries, it is essential to eliminate the background level of mutations. In fact, the in vitro construction of the library of double-stranded shuttle vectors from single-stranded circular DNA requires the process of treatment with T5 exonuclease, which drastically decreases background mutations.</p><p>In this study, to test the performance of our newly developed <italic>supF</italic> NGS assay, we conducted experiments using N<sub>12</sub>-BC libraries irradiated with UV-C at different doses. Although these pilot experiments were designed in a relatively simple way, they clearly exemplify the mutation spectrum associated with UV radiation exposure, and further experiments may provide profound insights into UV mutagenesis. Here, by using this novel assay we were able to confirm in both <italic>E. coli</italic> and human cells that the SNSs induced by UV were mainly C:G to T:A transitions, which is a known UV signature, and that the UV-induced DNA lesions were basically dipyrimidines â CPDs at T-T sites, and (6-4)PPs at T-T and T-C sites (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib62">Varghese and Wang, 1967</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Mao et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Lindberg et al., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Kamiya et al., 1993</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Kamiya et al., 1998</xref>). The SNSs are listed in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig10">Figure 10B</xref> (presented within pentanucleotide sequences of the <italic>supF</italic> gene) starting from the most frequent. In samples obtained from titer plates, the nucleotide sequence in eight of the top ten mutational hotspots was TT<underline>C</underline>/<underline>G</underline>AA, and the sequence of the top four mutational sites was TT<underline>C</underline>GA/TC<underline>G</underline>AA. These top four sites represent two palindromic TTCGAA/TTCGAA hexanucleotide sequences located at positions 115â120 and 123â128 in the <italic>supF</italic> gene. All top 10 mutations were C to T transitions and occurred at T<underline>C</underline> sites, and are likely the result of TLS opposite the 3'C of CPDs and (6-4)PPs via specialized DNA polymerases, such as PolÎ·, -Î¹, -Î¶, -Îº, -Î¸, -Î», and Rev1 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Achar and Foiani, 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib67">Yoon et al., 2021a</xref>). Notably, the site selection bias observed for the top 10 mutation hotspots seems to differ between the titer and the selection plates. In selection plates, three of the top ten hotspot mutations were C to T transitions at the 3'C of CC. These hotspot SNSs, particularly positions 130 and 121, appear to be next to or between hotspot SNSs in the titer plates. However, such SNS mutations, that were only observed in selection plates, were identified in both titer and selection plates as other types of mutations, specifically as hotspot DNS mutations, CC to TT, as shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig10">Figure 10C</xref> (located at 130 and 131 TTCGAAT<underline>CC</underline>TT, at 121 TTCGAA<underline>GG</underline>TTCGAA, at 5 TTT<underline>GAT</underline>A/T<underline>ATC</underline>AAA, or at 84 and 85 AA<underline>GG</underline>GAG/CTC<underline>CC</underline>TT). In addition, as shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig9">Figure 9B and C</xref>, the multiple mutations, either C or G mutations at the same base in identical N<sub>12</sub>-BC sequences, were identified in a dose-dependent manner more frequently from selection plates where TLS polymerases opposite UV lesions on the same DNA strand can cause clustered mutations. These multiple mutations include at least one phenotypic mutation in the <italic>supF</italic> gene but include also non-phenotypic mutations, which contributes to the specifics of the mutation spectrum in the selection plates. The two-base substitutions within trinucleotides, referred to as Del-in by VarDict, were mainly detected at higher UV doses as <underline>G</underline>A<underline>G:C</underline>T<underline>C</underline> to <underline>A</underline>A<underline>A:T</underline>T<underline>T</underline> at positions 73â75. It is unclear whether these mutations arose through unexpected UV-induced lesions at G<underline>C</underline>T<underline>C</underline>G sites, or the deamination of either the 5'C or the 3'C has occurred at these specific sites by different mechanisms. Alternatively, it can be hypothesized that the UV-induced DNA lesions arose on a single-stranded DNA (ssDNA) followed by a blockage of replication, or during DNA repair processes. It is known that ssDNA can be a substrate for a subclass of activation-induced deaminase/apolipoprotein B mRNA-editing catalytic polypeptide-like subfamily cytosine deaminases (APOBECs), which cause cluster mutations at TC:GA sites in the same strand of DNA by converting cytosine to uracil (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib43">Pecori et al., 2022</xref>). It is realistic to assume that the mutations at TC:GA sites had occurred via several different mechanisms. In fact, spontaneous mutations in non-UV-irradiated samples transfected into U2OS cells can also be detected at the order of 10<sup>â4</sup> per gene. In both UV-irradiated and non-irradiated samples, SNS mutations had basically occurred from C:G at T<underline>C:G</underline>A sites. Also, the major proportion of multiple mutations were C:G to T:A transitions. However, in non-UV-irradiated samples, the major proportion of single mutations were C:G to G:C transversions, which differed from the irradiated condition, where the major proportion was G:C to A:T transition (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig9">Figure 9C</xref>). It is possible that the oxidatively damaged base 8-oxoG was endogenously generated in the U2OS cells. As we have previously reported, 8-oxoG becomes a trigger for the DNA repair process and generates ssDNA as a substrate for APOBECs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib61">Suzuki et al., 2022</xref>). Here, the TT<underline>C</underline>/<underline>G</underline>AA site has emerged from data from titer plates as a mutational hotspot. According to previous reports, the TTC motif, and more specifically the cytosine in the motif, is a site of preference for APOBEC3A, APOBEC3C, APOBEC3F, and APOBEC3G, even though further investigation is needed (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Lindberg et al., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Love et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Adolph et al., 2018</xref>).</p><p>What might be more, a particular mutation was detected by VarDict in non-UV-irradiated samples as a Del-in mutation â a change from <underline>T</underline>T<underline>G</underline>A<underline>T:A</underline>T<underline>C</underline>A<underline>A</underline> to <underline>A</underline>T<underline>C</underline>A<underline>A:T</underline>T<underline>G</underline>A<underline>T</underline> at positions 3â7 within the potential hairpin loop of a quasi-palindromic sequence (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig14">Figure 14E</xref>), which may be the consequence of template switching events. The mutation was detected with a frequency at the order of 10<sup>â6</sup> per gene (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig12">Figure 12E</xref>), and was hardly detected in UV-irradiated samples, where it remains hidden by the UV-introduced mutations. Also, the same mutation was frequently detected as single SNS mutations from T:A to A:T at position 3, from G:C to C:G at position 5, and from T:A to A:T at position 7, or as combinations with other SNS mutations either or both from G:C to A:T at position â3 or/and from T:A to C:G at position 12 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig12s1">Figure 12âfigure supplement 1</xref>), which may be dependent on the regions used for template switching. Although the mono- and poly-ubiquitination of PCNA, facilitated by ubiquitin ligases Rad6-Rad18, HLTF, or SHPRH, is involved in the mechanism of switching between TLS and template switching in mammalian cells, the details are still ambiguous (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Chiu et al., 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Lin et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">Masuda et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib65">Wong et al., 2021</xref>). In addition, our recent studies on action-at-a-distance mutations, according to which a site-specific targeted single 8-oxoG or other types of DNA damage cause cluster mutations at untargeted positions, demonstrated a drastic strand bias for mutations at cytosines, specifically at 5â-TC-3â sites (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib59">Suzuki et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib60">Suzuki et al., 2021</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib61">Suzuki et al., 2022</xref>). Data on mutational strand asymmetries from cancer genome sequencing studies have emerged, indicating that APOBEC-associated mutagenesis during replication strongly favors the lagging-strand template (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib53">Seplyarskiy et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Haradhvala et al., 2016</xref>). And most recently, it has been proposed by a study using UPD-seq technique that APOBEC3A targets cytosines in small hairpin loops, within replication forks, in tRNA genes and at transcription start sites (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib48">Sakhtemani et al., 2022</xref>). In this study, strand biases in base substations from either C or G were clearly observed, consistent with what could be expected from the mechanisms by which UV photolesions are processed, such as cytosine deamination and the involvement of TLS. Interestingly, the strand bias switched between single base substitutions and cluster mutations depending on the doses of UV and the number of mutations per N<sub>12</sub>-BC. The precise reason and mechanisms behind this remain to be elucidated, but the observation brings new insights into the mechanisms of mutagenesis. In addition, the positions of SNSs in the multiple mutations were closer to each other compared to the theoretically expected positions (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig13s2">Figure 13âfigure supplements 2</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig13s3">3</xref>), which may reflect switching events involving TLS polymerases. It should be noted that the presented data for the distance between two SNSs in the multiple mutations was analyzed from the data from selection plates in order to secure a sufficient number of mutations, and therefore, there may be a bias due to hotspots associated with the selection process. However, the results from the limited number of mutations from the titer plates are similar to these from the selection plates. It can be proposed that this assay may also be applied for analysis of TLS polymerases in mammalian cells.</p><fig id="fig14" position="float"><label>Figure 14.</label><caption><title>Summary of results for ultraviolet (UV)-induced mutagenesis of the <italic>supF</italic> gene in mammalian cells.</title><p>(<bold>A</bold>) The nucleotide sequence of the non-transcribed strand (sense strand) is analyzed (233 bp, positions â19 to 214).

Innumerable physical, chemical, and biological mutagens, including anticancer drugs, induce characteristic mutations in genomic DNA via specific mutagenic processes. The mutation spectra obtained here by using the presented advanced method were in good agreement with accumulated data from previous papers where the conventional method had been used, with the advantage that our method provided less-biased mutation spectra data. As described above, the datasets presented here highlighted novel mutational signatures and also cluster mutations with a strand bias, which could be associated with the processes of replication, transcription, or repair of DNA damage, including a single-strand break (a nick). In this study, eight series of <italic>supF</italic> shuttle vector plasmids were constructed, as presented in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1âfigure supplement 1</xref>; however, the analysis was carried out using N<sub>12</sub>-BC libraries prepared from either pNGS2-K1 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figures 1</xref>â<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">4</xref>) or pNGS2-K3 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figures 5</xref>â<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig10">10</xref>). The pNGS2-K1/-A1/-K4/-A4 and pNGS2-K2/-A2/-K3/-A3 vector series contain an M13 intergenic region with opposite orientations relative to the <italic>supF</italic> gene, which allows us to incorporate specific types of DNA damage at specific sites in the opposite strand of the vector library. Also, the pNGS2-K1/-A1/-K3/-A3 and pNGS2-K2/-A2/-K4/-A4 vector series contain the SV40 replication origin, which enables bidirectional replication and transcription, at opposite sides of the <italic>supF</italic> gene. Although this is still preliminary data, it is notable that the spontaneously induced mutations for the different vectors in U2OS cells were not significantly different. Therefore, the here presented mutagenesis assay with NGS, by using these series of libraries, can be applied in many different types of experiments to address both quantitative and qualitative features of mutagenesis. It is possible to design series of libraries containing DNA lesions or sequences suitable for the investigation of specific molecular mechanisms, such as TLS, template switching, and asymmetric cluster mutations. We are currently trying to develop a different test system for broader mutation spectrum analysis using the BC library with random oligonucleotide sequences; however, the assay using the <italic>supF</italic> gene presented in this paper has a significant advantage in both efficiency as a mutagenesis assay and cost-effectiveness. We believe that the method presented here will be used in further experiments by us and by other laboratories to advance the research on environmental mutagenesis, carcinogenesis, DNA repair, and will hopefully contribute to mutagenesis research by promoting accumulation of data for machine learning.</p></sec><sec id="s4" sec-type="materials|methods"><title>Materials and methods</title><sec id="s4-1"><title>Plasmids and plasmid constructions</title><p>The eight series of <italic>supF</italic> shuttle vector plasmids â pNGS2-K1, -K2, -K3, -K4, -A1, -A2, -A3, -A4, shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1âfigure supplement 1</xref>, were constructed from a pSB189L <italic>supF</italic> shuttle vector (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib41">Parris and Seidman, 1992</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib42">Parris et al., 1994</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib61">Suzuki et al., 2022</xref>) using NEBuilder HiFi DNA Assembly Master Mix (New England Biolabs, Ipswich, MA).

The presumed number of required colonies was harvested as a cell pellet by scraping, and libraries were extracted using GenElute plasmid miniprep kit (Merck).</p></sec><sec id="s4-4"><title>Preparation of samples with unique indexes for multiplexed NGS</title><p>Each sample with a unique index for multiplexed NGS was prepared by PCR using KOD One PCR Master Mix (TOYOBO). For the standard protocol, 10 ng of the library (or from 1 to 100 ng for experiments presented in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figures 2</xref>â<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">4</xref>) extracted from <italic>E. coli</italic> as described above was used for a 50 Î¼L PCR reaction (30 cycles of amplification at 98Â°C for 10 s, 60Â°C for 5 s, and 68Â°C for 1 s) with a series of primer sets (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="fig1sdata1">Figure 1âsource data 1</xref>) containing a pre-designed 6-nt sequence (N<sub>6</sub>) as an index sequence for distinguishing each sample by sequence data analysis. PCR products were purified using NucleoSpin Gel and PCR Clean-up (TaKara Bio Inc), and then analyzed and quantified by Nanodrop spectrometer (Thermo Fisher Scientific) and agarose gel electrophoresis. The uniquely indexed samples were combined together in the proper proportion according to the expected number of NGS reads for each sample. More than 100 reads per N<sub>12</sub>-BC sequence were obtained for all samples in this study (approximately 400 and 16 Mb of sequencing data for the titer plates and the selection plates, respectively).</p></sec><sec id="s4-5"><title>DNBSeq sequencing and sequencing processing</title><p>Preparation of NGS libraries and sequencing were conducted by Seibutsu Giken Inc (Japan). The libraries were subjected to multiplexed deep sequencing in 200 bp paired-end mode on the NGS using a BGISEQ-G400 platform (MGI Tech, China). The concentration of the NGS samples was measured using either Synergy LX (Agilent Technologies, Santa Clara, CA) and QuantiFluor dsDNA System (Promega, Madison, WI), or Qubit 3.0 Fluorometer (Thermo Fisher Scientific) and dsDNA HS Assay Kit (Thermo Fisher Scientific). The libraries for DNBSeq were prepared using either MGIEasy FS DNA Library Prep Set (MGI Tech) (25 ng of sample, 8 cycles) or MGIEasy PCR-Free DNA Library Prep Set (MGI Tech) (200 ng of sample, enzymatic digestion for 4 min). The quality of the prepared libraries was assessed using an Agilent 2100 bioanalyzer and a High Sensitivity DNA kit (Agilent Technologies), or Fragment Analyzer and dsDNA 915 Reagent Kit (Agilent Technologies). The DNA nanoball was generated from the libraries using the MGIEasy Circularization Kit (MGI Tech).</p></sec><sec id="s4-6"><title>NGS data analysis</title><p>The FASTQ files generated from each N<sub>6</sub>-index sample (sorting was performed by Seibutsu Giken Inc) were used for the following analysis: (1) The reverse-complement sequences were obtained from FASTQ data using SeqKit tools (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib54">Shen et al., 2016</xref>). (2) The paired-end reads from FASTQ data including the reverse-complement sequences were merged with a minimum 30 bp overlap region using CASPER (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Kwon et al., 2014</xref>). (3) The merged sequences were mapped to a reference sequence, and only aligned sequences were converted to BAM files by using minimap2 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Li, 2018</xref>). (4) BAM files were converted to FASTQ files using SAMtools (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Li et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Li, 2011</xref>). (5) The extraction of the most likely true N<sub>12</sub>-BC sequences with error corrections was performed based on a whitelist by UMI tools (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib57">Smith et al., 2017</xref>). Two 6-nt sequences, GGCGAT and ATCGAA, were used for the N<sub>12</sub>-BC extraction, with only one base differences between N<sub>12</sub>-BC sequences being allowed, and corrections were implemented using the following regular expression: (&quot;.*(GGCGAT){s â¤ 0}(?<italic>P</italic>&lt;cell_1&gt;.{12})(?<italic>P</italic>&lt;umi_1&gt;.{0})(ATCGAA){s â¤ 0}.*&quot;). (6) Using VarDict, the sequence data for all N<sub>12</sub>-BC sequences with more than 9 reads per N<sub>12</sub>-BC was employed for the alignment to the reference sequence, variant calling, and calculation of allele frequencies (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Lai et al., 2016</xref>). (7) Spotfire version 7.11.1 (TIBCO, Palo Alto, CA) was used for data organization, filtering, and visualization.</p></sec></sec></body><back><sec sec-type="additional-information"

Early DNA sequencing technologies enabled direct identification of mutations in target genes provided that the mutant genes could be readily isolated. This requirement stimulated the development of shuttle vector plasmids that carried a mutation marker gene and could replicate in both mammalian and bacterial cells. These were used in experiments in which the plasmids, treated with a mutagen, would be passaged through mammalian host cells after which the progeny plasmids were introduced into an indicator bacterial strain. Colonies with mutant marker genes could be distinguished by color or survival, the plasmids recovered, and the sequence of the mutant gene determined. The shuttle vector plasmid that became the most widely used contained as the marker the supF amber suppressor tyrosyl tRNA gene positioned in the plasmid such that deletion mutations associated with mammalian cell transfection were selected against. Although various improvements have been introduced since its introduction in the mid-1980s, including bar codes to distinguish independent from sibling mutations (in the early 1990s), the basics of the system have been maintained, and it and variations are still in use.</p><p>The Kamiya group has made several adjustments to the supF shuttle vectors, including the construction of indicator bacterial strains based on survival of bacteria containing mutant supF genes (the initial system relied on colony color). They have published many studies of mutagenesis by various agents, error prone polymerases, etc. In the current submission they describe a comprehensive approach to identifying mutations in the supF gene that exploits Next Generation Sequencing technology that can identify the full spectrum of mutations including those that escape detection in phenotypic screens. The study is exhaustive and presents a methodical validation of each component of their approach. They report UV induced mutations, the mechanism of which has been well characterized in previous literature. They also describe a category of multiple mutations, which had been observed in the early work with the supF plasmids, and whose relationship to UV photoproducts is most likely indirect.</p></disp-quote><p>We thank the Reviewer for their very insightful feedback to our manuscript and their positive assessment. We have added some discussion points based on the essential references mentioned in the Reviewerâs comments, which we believe made the explanation of our study more complete.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Major comments:</p><p>This manuscript presents a technical advance on the use of the supF mutation reporter system. The extent of the validation of each component of the system, including the bar code is rigorous. Their data on the nature and location of UV induced mutations are in very good agreement with previous studies with supF and other reporter genes, a further validation of their approach. Their discussion of the mechanism of the UV induced mutations is in accord with prior work from other laboratories. However, their interpretation of the multiple mutations, although reasonable in invoking a role for APOBEC deamination of cytosines (see eLife. 2014; 3: e02001 for another discussion of this issue), overlooks a much earlier study on the same topic that showed that nicks in the vicinity of the marker gene are mutagenic and can induce multiple mutations (Proc Natl Acad Sci 1987 84:4944-8). It would be useful for the authors to consider their data on the multiple mutations in the light of the earlier analysis. Furthermore, a check to verify the covalently closed circular integrity of the plasmid preparations would be an important quality control and could reduce the mutagenesis observed in 0 UV controls.</p></disp-quote><p>We thank the Reviewer for the valuable comments that made our manuscript clearer and more emphatic. We are hereby addressing all of the Reviewerâs concerns. The available data accumulated from previous studies have proved the high sensitivity of the supF assay as a mutagenesis assay, which now has been clearly supported by the results in the current study. We believe that this NGS assay will be able to fulfil the data requirements to tackle many questions related to mutagenesis, thanks to the simplicity and cost-effectiveness of the procedure. However, to meet the experimental objectives, the preparation and analysis of the library are crucially important procedures in the stages of initial setting up of the assay. The covalently closed circular integrity of the vector library is definitely one of the important points we should pay attention to when performing this assay. After the construction of the BC<sub>12</sub>-library, we have to check the quality of the library by agarose gel electrophoresis. The background mutation frequency and the sequence of the library itself (uploaded as described in the data availability section of this manuscript) also needs to be analyzed by NGS before the experiment. We are also routinely constructing the double-stranded shuttle vector from a single-stranded circular DNA with a variety of site-specific damaged oligonucleotides. The treatment with T5 exonuclease followed by purification is absolutely essential to decrease the background mutation frequency. Without the treatment with the exonuclease, cluster mutations may be increased under specific experimental conditions. For this study, we carried out the conventional supF assay using the BC<sub>12</sub>-library purified after T5 exonuclease treatment. However, in this case the process of purification slightly increased the mutant frequency of the BC<sub>12</sub>-library to about 2 x10<sup>-4</sup> (corresponding to 1x10<sup>-6</sup>/bp).Therefore, when setting up the essay, we have to consider the background control that we will need for the data analysis. In response to the Reviewerâs comments, we have now added the following paragraph in the Discussion section:</p><p>Page 16, line 25:</p><p>â(5) For the supF assay, spontaneous cluster mutations at TC:GA sites were often observed, and it was well illustrated in an earlier study that a nick in the shuttle vector was a trigger for these asymmetric cluster mutations (54). Therefore, we need to be aware of the quality of each library and how it affects the outcome of each analysis, especially for detection of very low levels of mutations. Depending on the purpose of the experiments, in the preparation of covalently closed circular vector libraries it is essential to eliminate the background level of mutations. In fact, the in vitro construction of the library of double-stranded shuttle vectors from single-stranded circular DNA requires the process of treatment with T5 Exonuclease, which drastically decreases background mutations.â</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Minor points</p><p>The authors state that only 30% of the base sequence of the supF gene can be &quot;used for dual-antibiotic selection on the indicator <italic>E. coli</italic>&quot;. An earlier review (Mutation Res 220: 61,1989) indicated that within the mature tRNA region single or tandem mutations had been reported at 87% of sites, using the colony color assay. The direct NGS analyses would be indifferent to phenotype, and one would expect the maximum number of mutable sites would be recovered from this approach. It would be helpful for an explicit statement regarding the number of mutant sites to be in the Discussion, as this should strengthen the case for the NGS strategy.</p></disp-quote><p>We thank the Reviewer for the helpful comment. These are important points we should indeed mention. This method will complement previous data, and especially the data from titer plates will provide us with non-biased mutation spectra for the whole analyzed region. We have now explained in detail about the coverage of mutation spectra in the discussion section.</p><p>Page 14, line 14:</p><p>âThe mutation spectra of single or tandem base-substitutions for inactive supF genes identified by using the blue-white colony color assays were comprehensively summarized in an earlier review article, and it was noted that the mutations were detected at 86 sites within a 158-bp region covering the supF gene (54%) and at 74 sites within the 85-bp mature tRNA region (87%), thus demonstrating the great sensitivity of the supF assay system for analysis of mutation spectra (19). However, obtaining reliable datasets by the conventional supF assay requires skill and experience, especially for studies where the mutations of interest are induced with low frequency. The method has been advanced by the construction of indicator bacterial strains with different supF reporter genes which allow selection based on survival of bacteria containing mutant supF genes. However, the fact that the supF phenotypic selection process relies on the structure and function of transfer RNAs that may be differently affected by different mutations means that the improvement of the efficiency of the selection process may cause loss of coverage of the mutation spectra, as it is under our experimental conditions, where the coverage is about 30% (19,20).â</p><p>Page 15, line 4:</p><p>âFrom this point of view, we believe that we can secure a sufficient number of experiments to improve the accuracy of the analysis and to confirm the reproducibility of the experiments. Furthermore, the data from colonies grown on titer plates provides us, at least in principle, and with the exception of large deletions and insertions, with non-biased mutation spectra for the whole analyzed region.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Supplementary Figure 1 shows the organization of 8 supF reporter plasmids. Were these discussed in the text and employed in the experiments? It was not clear in the text.</p></disp-quote><p>We thank the Reviewer for the helpful comment. It was indeed not clear which vectors we used and why we constructed a series of vectors. Now, we have added the vectors we used for the constructions of the library and each experiment in the RESULTS and MATERIALS AND METHODS sections. Since this is quite important for us and, we believe, the readers, we also added the explanations in the Discussion section, detailing why we have constructed a series of shuttle vectors, as follows:</p><p>Page 19, line 36:</p><p>âMutational signatures identified in cancer cells are emerging as valuable markers for cancer diagnosis and therapeutics. Innumerable physical, chemical and biological mutagens, including anticancer drugs, induce characteristic mutations in genomic DNA via specific mutagenic processes. The mutation spectra obtained here by using the presented advanced method were in good agreement with accumulated data from previous papers where the conventional method had been used, with the advantage that our method provided less-biased mutation spectra data. As described above, the datasets presented here highlighted novel mutational signatures and also cluster mutations with a strand-bias, which could be associated with the processes of replication, transcription, or repair of DNA-damage, including a single strand break (a nick). In this study, eight series of supF shuttle vector plasmids were constructed, as presented in Supplementary Figure S1; however, the analysis was carried out using N<sub>12</sub>-BC libraries prepared from either pNGS2-K1 (Figures 1-4) or pNGS2-K3 (Figures 5-10). The pNGS2-K1/-A1/-K4/-A4 and pNGS2-K2/-A2/-K3/-A3 vector series contain an M13 intergenic region with opposite orientations relative to the supF gene, which allows us to incorporate specific types of DNA-damage at specific sites in the opposite strand of the vector library. Also, the pNGS2-K1/-A1/-K3/-A3 and pNGS2-K2/-A2/-K4/-A4 vector series contain the SV40 replication origin, which enables bidirectional replication and transcription, at opposite sides of the supF gene. Although this is still preliminary data, it is notable that the spontaneously induced mutations for the different vectors in U2OS cells were not significantly different. Therefore, the here presented mutagenesis assay with NGS, by using these series of libraries, can be applied in many different types of experiments to address both quantitative and qualitative features of mutagenesis. It is possible to design series of libraries containing DNA lesions or sequences suitable for the investigation of specific molecular mechanisms, such as TLS, template switching, and asymmetric cluster mutations.â</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Cross-consultation comments</p><p>Comment on the issue raised by Reviewer #2 regarding plasmids with unrepaired DNA damage introduced into <italic>E. coli</italic> after passage through U2OS cells: treatment of the plasmid harvest with Dpn1 eliminates un-replicated plasmid DNA.

The manuscript is well written, providing design, methods, and results of the experimental system in very much details, which this reviewer highly evaluates. However, the manuscript may be too long and could be more concise. In addition, this reviewer is afraid that main figures seem difficult to fit printed pages (especially multi-paneled figures of large size, such as Figure 5 through 8). The authors should re-organize the figures by reducing size and/or moving partly to supplementary information.</p></disp-quote><p>We thank the Reviewer for the helpful comments to our manuscript. It is true that the multi-paneled figures were too large, and we have now re-analyzed and optimized most of the figures by reducing size, transferring to Supplementary Figures, and separating one figure into two. Although the number of Figures and Supplementary Figures have now increased, we believe that it has become easy to follow for readers and to fit printed pages. We considered carefully the Reviewerâs remark about the length of the manuscript, but we feel that the text was already as concise as we could make it, and we have already left out some more detailed explanations.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Specific comments</p><p>1. Some UV-induced DNA damage (typically CPD) is repaired only slowly in human cells, so that the replicated plasmid DNAs recovered from U2OS cells may still contain damage and possibly induce mutations in <italic>E. coli</italic> after transfection. As the result of high sensitivity of NGS analysis, it is worried that such mutations could be also included in the results. To obtain even more accurate mutational characteristics in mammalian cells, the authors could consider to treat the DNA samples with photolyases before transformation of E. coli. The authors could consider to discuss on this point.</p></disp-quote><p>We thank the Reviewer for the helpful comment, indeed Dpn I treatment is one of the very important procedures for avoiding analysis bias. We have now expanded the explanation why the libraries have to be treated with Dpn I, as follows:</p><p>Page 11, line 4:</p><p>âthe libraries were extracted from the cells, and treated with dam-G<sup>m</sup>ATC-methylated DNA specific restriction enzyme Dpn I to digest un-replicated DNAs that contain UV-photoproducts.â</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>2. It is quite intriguing that multiple mutations in a single BC clone tend to occur in the same DNA strand. Is there any trend in a distance between the mutated sites? Considering participation of TLS polymerases in the first round of replication, it may be interesting if multiple DNA lesions occur in relatively close positions so that TLS polymerases elongate the DNA strand without switching back to replicative polymerases.</p></disp-quote><p>We thank the Reviewer for the valuable and insightful suggestions for this assay. We have analyzed the positions of SNSs in multiple-mutations shown in Supplementary Figures S11 and S12. As the reviewer mentioned, we may be able to address the mechanisms of TLS switching in mammalian cells by using this assay. In this study, the obtained non-biased mutation spectra of multiple mutations may not be enough for the static analysis, but our results indicate that multiple mutations were induced at relatively close positions. It would be interesting if we could address the mechanisms of TLS polymerase switching. We believe that the accumulation of large numbers of non-biased mutation spectra will provide us with growing opportunities to address more questions in mutagenesis. We have now added the Supplementary Figures S11 and S12, as well as the following discussion points:</p><p>Page 14, line 6:</p><p>â(5) The distance between two SNSs in multiple mutations induced by UV irradiation was relatively shorter than the theoretically expected based on the sequence (Supplementary Figures S11 and S12).â</p><p>Page 18, line 27:</p><p>âIn addition, the positions of SNSs in the multiple mutations were closer to each other compared to the theoretically expected positions (Supplementary Figures S11 and S12), which may reflect switching events involving TLS polymerases. It should be noted that the presented data for the distance between two SNSs in the multiple mutations was analyzed from the data from selection plates in order to secure a sufficient number of mutations, and therefore, there may be a bias due to hot spots associated with the selection process. However, the results from the limited number of mutations from the titer plates are similar to these from the selection plates. It can be proposed that this assay may also be applied for analysis of TLS polymerases in mammalian cells.â</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>3. This reviewer is wondering whether the results of mammalian cells are influenced by transcription-coupled repair in this experimental system. Because the SV40 replication origin functions as bidirectional promoters, the supF region may be transcribed in U2OS cells so that DNA damage on transcribed strands may be removed more efficiently than non-transcribed strands. Please comment on this, if relevant.</p></disp-quote><p>We thank the Reviewer for the insightful comments. This issue is also very important and interesting, and should be addressed in the mutagenesis research. That is exactly the reason why we presented series of vectors for the assay in this paper. The SV40 replication origin has an effect on the background mutations, which this is also dependent on the experimental conditions. However, this needs to be confirmed by further studies. We hope the idea for these constructions will be helpful for many laboratories. We have now added the following parts in the Discussion section.</p><p>Page 18, line 36:</p><p>âMutational signatures identified in cancer cells are emerging as valuable markers for cancer diagnosis and therapeutics.
