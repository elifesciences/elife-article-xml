Emergence of these ‘superbugs’ including ESKAPE (<italic>Enterococcus faecium</italic>, <italic>Staphylococcus aureus</italic>, <italic>Klebsiella pneumoniae</italic>, <italic>Acinetobacter baumannii</italic>, <italic>Pseudomonas aeruginosa</italic>, and <italic>Enterobacter spp</italic>.) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib58">Peneş et al., 2017</xref>) call for novel approaches to design antibiotic compounds that act as ‘evolution drugs’ by blocking evolutionary escape from antibiotic stressor. Currently, drug development protocols and treatment strategies have limited success in addressing the issue of drug resistance as it overlooks the driving complex underlying evolutionary selection processes. The problem of drug resistance and its potential solutions constitutes important aspects of ‘Evolutionary medicine’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib77">Stearns, 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib87">Williams and Nesse, 1991</xref>). Apart from addressing specific questions involving disease mechanism and their ontogeny, evolutionary medicine takes a more comprehensive approach and aims to address evolutionary questions such as selective advantage of a phenotype and/or the associated phylogeny (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib54">Nesse and Stearns, 2008</xref>). This makes it immensely pertinent in the context of the problem of drug resistance which is primarily an evolutionary escape under conditions of selection pressure exerted by chemical stressors viz. antibiotics. Application of evolution principles has been promising in the studies of infectious diseases, aging, and cancer therapy (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib54">Nesse and Stearns, 2008</xref>). Evolution of cancer cells and their complex ways to evade the anti-cancer therapeutics in many ways resembles the evolutionary selection of resistant bacterial cells evading the antibiotic action (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib77">Stearns, 2012</xref>). Development of ‘evolution drugs’ – <italic>compounds that block or slow down escape routes to resistance</italic> – is inspired by recent progress in understanding of evolutionary dynamics of pathogen escape from stressors (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Chakraborty and Barton, 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Gong et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">Klein et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib50">Marchi et al., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib65">Rotem et al., 2018</xref>). Recent report of compounds modulating proteins controlling mutation rates is an interesting lead in that direction (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib60">Ragheb et al., 2019</xref>). Using evolution drugs to slow down evolutionary dynamics of pathogen or cancer escape can help tilt the balance of evolutionary arms-race in favour of the host immune system.</p><p>Selectively targeting bacterial proteins which are critical to essential bacterial life processes like cell wall biosynthesis, translation, DNA replication etc. with novel compounds forms the basis of antibiotics development programs. Dihydrofolate reductase (DHFR) is one such protein, which, due to its critical role in nucleotide biosynthesis, has been a central antibacterial and anticancer drug target (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib42">Lin and Bertino, 1991</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib70">Schweitzer et al., 1990</xref>). Based on the chemical scaffold, DHFR inhibitors can be divided into classical and non-classical ones. The classical DHFR inhibitors generally contain a 2,4-diamino-1,3-diaza pharmacophore group (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib76">Srinivasan et al., 2017</xref>) which constitute structural analogues of its substrate dihydrofolate and competitively bind the receptor-DHFR active site. Inhibitors of this type such as methotrexate (MTX) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Bleyer, 2015</xref>) and pralatrexate (PDX) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Izbicka et al., 2009</xref>) are approved as anticancer drugs. In addition, predominant classes of inhibitors derived from dihydrofolate analogues also include diaminoquinazoline, diaminopyrimidine, diaminopteridine, and diaminotriazines (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib76">Srinivasan et al., 2017</xref>). Non-classical antifolate drugs like trimethoprim (TMP)(<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Finland and Kass, 1973</xref>) trimetotrexate (TMQ) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib42">Lin and Bertino, 1991</xref>), that interact selectively with bacterial but not human DHFR are approved as antibacterial drugs. Without the solvent accessible group of glutamic acid, they are more fat-soluble, passively diffuse into cells, and are also not substrates for folylpolyglutamate synthetase enzymes. However, due to rapid emergence of resistant mutations in DHFR, the development of drug resistance to antifolate antibiotics belonging to any of the above-mentioned classes presents a significant challenge (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">Huovinen et al., 1995</xref>). Nevertheless, TMP and other non-classical anti-folates can be attractive templates for bringing in modifications in the structure of DHFR inhibitors and derive novel DHFR inhibitors (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib88">Wróbel et al., 2020</xref>).</p><p>In general, both clinical and in vitro studies have shown that accumulation of point mutations in critical amino acids residues of the binding cavity represent an important mode of trimethoprim resistance. Factors associated with TMP resistance are far more complex in the clinical isolates. A recent study has shown the contribution of mobile dfrA genes to TMP resistance in the emerging pathogen Acinetobacter baumannii and its association to chromosomal folA genes in rapidly mobilizing novel mutations (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib66">Sánchez-Osuna et al., 2020</xref>). The study shows how sulfonamide resistance in general extends to TMP with generalized chromosomal resistance determinants predating the origin of several genera and several clusters of resistance genes disseminated broadly among clinical isolates. Further, whole-genome sequencing of TMP-resistant <italic>E. coli</italic> clinical isolates showed the contribution of dfrB genes toward clinical TMP resistance (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib82">Toulouse et al., 2017</xref>). Thus, mechanisms leading to TMP resistance could be extremely diverse and complex. These complications notwithstanding, in our current study we focus on a simplified experimental model system of in vitro evolution whereby resistant phenotypes emerge from point mutations in the folA locus as outlined in detail below.</p><p>Point mutations conferring resistance in bacteria to anti-DHFR compounds are primarily located in the folA locus that encodes DHFR in <italic>E. coli</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib56">Oz et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib79">Tamer et al., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib81">Toprak et al., 2012</xref>) making DHFR an appealing target to develop evolution antibiotic drugs. A possible approach is to design compounds that can inhibit the wild type (WT) DHFR along with its resistant variants thus making multiple evolutionary pathways toward drug-resistance less accessible. In this work, we developed an integrative computational modeling and biological evaluation workflow to discover novel DHFR inhibitors that are active against WT and resistant variants. Structure-based virtual screening (SBVS) including molecular docking with subsequent validation by molecular dynamics (MD) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Cheron and Shakhnovich, 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib41">Leonardo et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib44">Liu et al., 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib93">Zhang et al., 2017</xref>) were used to screen a large compound database. We found a series of DHFR inhibitors with novel scaffolds that are active against both the WT and several mutant DHFR proteins and are cytotoxic against WT <italic>E. coli</italic> along with <italic>E. coli</italic> strains with chromosomally incorporated TMP-resistant DHFR variants (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib57">Palmer et al., 2015</xref>). Those inhibitors are more potent against the escape variants than the WT DHFR. This makes them promising candidates for further development of next generation of antibiotics that prevent fast emergence of resistance.</p></sec><sec id="s2" sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><sec id="s2-1"><title>In silico search for potent broad DHFR inhibitors</title><p>The key objective of our approach is to find compounds that <italic>simultaneously</italic> inhibit WT and drug resistant variants of a target protein. Firstly, we developed an integrative computational workflow including molecular docking, molecular dynamics and evaluation of protein-ligand interaction along with Lipinski’s rule of five (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib49">Manto et al., 2018</xref>) filter to screen two commercial databases that include about 1.8 million compounds (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1A</xref>). First, we assessed which conformation of M20 loop of DHFR (closed, open or occluded) should be used for molecular docking. To that end, we evaluated which conformation of the M20 loop in the target structure gives rise to best agreement between docking score and experimental binding affinity for known DHFR inhibitors. By classification (see Materials and methods: <italic>Crystal structure selection</italic>), we selected four representative crystal structures (closed: PDB 1<italic>RX</italic>3, open: PDB 1RA3, occluded: PDB 1RC4 and PDB 5CCC, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1</xref>) as putative target structures for docking. Using the closed conformation of M20 loop (PDB 1<italic>RX</italic>3), we were able to recover the largest proportion of known inhibitors (Table 2 and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s2">Figure 1—figure supplements 2</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s3">3</xref>). Therefore, the closed conformation of M20 loop (PDB 1<italic>R</italic>X3) was adopted as the most representative crystal structure for the initial SBVS of compound databases for novel broad range inhibitors. It was also used for subsequent in-depth evaluation of most promising candidates using molecular dynamics simulation.

Our approach to predict binding free energy is based on a series of relatively short MD simulations of binding conformations with subsequent MMPBSA scoring as presented in <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Cheron and Shakhnovich, 2017</xref>. Next, we assessed the accuracy of this approach for WT and mutant DHFR in reproducing binding affinities of known ligands. To that end, we built linear regression equation models (see Figure 1B and Figure 1C and Materials and methods: <italic>Construction of binding affinity prediction model</italic>) to predict binding free energies calculated by MMPBSA.</p><p>The models reproduced known binding affinities with high accuracy (see <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1B and C</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s4">Figure 1—figure supplement 4</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s6">Figure 1—figure supplement 6</xref>). Additionally, we constructed linear regression equation models to predict binding free energy of TMP against WT DHFR from Listeria grayi (<italic>L. grayi</italic>) and Chlamydia muridarum (<italic>C. muridarum</italic>) again showing highly significant correlation between predicted and experimental values (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s7">Figure 1—figure supplement 7</xref>), demonstrating broad predictive power of the method. More detail on the construction of binding affinity prediction models can be found in the Materials and methods: <italic>Construction of binding affinity prediction model</italic>.</p><p>Further, the analysis of the DHFR crystal structures showed that Asp27 forms hydrogen bond with almost all DHFR inhibitors in the ligand-binding cavity. Thus, compounds predicted by docking that make hydrogen bond with Asp27 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1A</xref>) and having MMPBSA predicted binding free energies less than –20 kcal/mol (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="supp1">Supplementary file 1</xref>. <italic>Compound Information</italic>) against both the WT and all TMP-resistant variants of DHFR were selected for further evaluation. Out of this set, we selected the novel compounds that differ substantially from 183 known DHFR inhibitors (see Materials and methods: <italic>Selection of virtual screening hits</italic>). Generally, compounds with similar properties tend to have similar activity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">Kumar, 2011</xref>). Based on that principle, we compared two-dimensional (2D) physicochemical properties (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib91">Zhang et al., 2013</xref>) and protein-ligand interaction fingerprint (PLIF) features (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib51">Marcou and Rognan, 2007</xref>) of the prospective set with those of the known inhibitors. Results showed that the selected hits have high similarity in both 2D-physicochemical properties and PLIF features when compared with known DHFR inhibitors, which suggest their potential inhibitory activity against DHFR (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s8">Figure 1—figure supplement 8</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s9">Figure 1—figure supplement 9</xref>). On the other hand, they show relatively low chemical similarity (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s8">Figure 1—figure supplement 8</xref>) with the known DHFR inhibitors, suggesting that the selected hits are chemically novel.

For compound CD15, the Ki values were all less than 5 μM against WT and three single-point DHFR mutants. For the L28R mutant, the Ki values were 1.0 μM, outperforming the WT, P21L, or A26T mutant DHFR. It is worth noting that L28R is a strong TMP escape variant (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib62">Rodrigues et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib81">Toprak et al., 2012</xref>), thus the discovered CD15 series appeared a promising candidate for an ‘evolution drug’ that has a potential to suppress even most intractable escape variants. Based on these data we decided to proceed with compounds CD15 and CD17 for in depth evaluation. In addition, we evaluated activity of the two most promising inhibitors, CD15 and CD17 against WT DHFR from two more species: <italic>L.grayi</italic> and <italic>C.muridarum</italic>. We found that both compounds showed similar inhibition against the two species (see <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3</xref> and <xref ref-type="table" rid="table1">Table 1</xref>).

To that end, we searched the ChemDiv database (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://www.chemdiv.com/">http://www.chemdiv.com/</ext-link>) for compounds that are similar to CD15 and CD17. The search yielded a total of 12 extra compounds which were subsequently obtained and evaluated for their inhibitory activity against DHFR in vitro and as inhibitors of <italic>E. coli</italic> bacterial growth. The inhibitory <inline-formula><mml:math id="inf1"><mml:semantics><mml:mrow><mml:msub><mml:mi>K</mml:mi><mml:mi>i</mml:mi></mml:msub></mml:mrow></mml:semantics></mml:math></inline-formula> values against WT DHFR were in the range of 2–8 μM for the six compounds from the CD15 series and in the range of 3–30 μM for the six compounds from the CD17 series (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4C</xref>). Four compounds including CD15-2, CD15-3, CD15-4, and CD15-6 showed better or comparable inhibition for WT and L28R DHFR than CD15 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4C</xref>). Next, we evaluated in vivo activity of these compounds. Results showed that the compound CD15-3 with a naphthalene group (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5A</xref>) instead of the trimethoxybenzene of CD15 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2C</xref>) showed marked improvement of efficacy with three to four times lower IC<sub>50</sub> values compared to that of CD15 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4D</xref>). CD15-3 showed about 2.4-fold better efficacy than that of TMP on L28R <italic>E. coli</italic> variant strain (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4E</xref>). As potential antibiotic leads are supposed to be selective in targeting bacterial protein and not the host protein, we went on to check if CD15-3 interacts and inhibits human DHFR. As shown in <xref ref-type="table" rid="table1">Table 1</xref> no inhibitory activity for CD15-3 was detected against human DHFR. The drop in the fluorescence signal corresponding to the conversion of NADPH and DHFR mediated formation of THF was persistently observed at all concentrations of CD15-3, indicating no inhibition on human DHFR activity (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s1">Figure 4—figure supplement 1</xref>). Structural analysis provided a plausible explanation of selective inhibition of <italic>E. coli</italic> DHFR by CD15-3 and lack of inhibitory activity against human DHFR (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s2">Figure 4—figure supplement 2</xref>). Upon comparison of the crystal structures of <italic>E. coli</italic> DHFR (PDB 1<italic>R</italic>X3) and human DHFR (PDB 1KMS), we noted there are significant sequence differences between them in the ligand-binding domain (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s2">Figure 4—figure supplement 2</xref>). Different pair of amino acids between <italic>E. coli</italic> DHFR and human DHFR includes Met20: Leu22, Asp27: Glu30, Leu28: Phe31, Trp30: Tyr33, Ile94: Val115. The lack of inhibition on human DHFR for CD15-3 can be attributed to the loss of the pi-pi interaction with Phe31.

Most of the CD17 series compounds did not show significantly better efficacy against L28R than the original CD17 (see <xref ref-type="table" rid="table2">Table 2</xref>). To address a possibility that CD17 series is a ‘false positive’ mostly targeting another protein(s) we turned to pan assay interference compounds (PAINS) filter that seeks compounds which tend to react non-specifically with numerous biological targets simultaneously rather than specifically affecting one desired target (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Baell and Holloway, 2010</xref>). Thus, all 12 CD15 and CD17 series compounds were filtered through the PAINS (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://cbligand.org/PAINS/">http://cbligand.org/PAINS/</ext-link>) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Baell and Holloway, 2010</xref>). All six CD17 series compounds did not pass the PAINS test and therefore were not considered for further analysis.</p><p>The binding mode of the two most promising compounds CD15 and CD15-3 were evaluated using molecular docking (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1a</xref>, Glide XP mode) with the target <italic>E. coli</italic> DHFR (PDB 1<italic>R</italic>X3). As shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5B and C</xref>, both compounds formed two hydrogen bonds with the key residue Asp27 by the hydroxy group in the 6-hydroxy-3-methylpyrimidine-2,4 (1H,3H)-dione scaffold. The binding modes of CD15 and CD15-3 overlapped perfectly with the binding conformation of TMP, providing rationale for the inhibitory activity of CD15 series. However, in addition to the hydrogen bond formed with Asp27, TMP also forms hydrogen bond with another critical residue Ile94 as well as the conserved water molecule HOH302. Nevertheless, unlike TMP, our hit compounds showed broad inhibitory activity in vitro and in vivo on both the WT and mutant DHFR strains. The broad activity of CD15 compounds can be explained, in part by a dihydro-1H-pyrazole group in the same position as methylene group of TMP. Naphthalene group of CD15-3 extends further in DHFR binding pocket than the corresponding trimethoxybenzene of TMP, potentially resulting in additional hydrophobic interaction with L28R in DHFR which provides structural rationale for strong potency of CD15-3 against resistant L28R variant.</p></sec><sec id="s2-5"><title>Target validation in vivo</title><p>To confirm DHFR as the intracellular target of CD15-3 we overexpressed DHFR in <italic>E. coli</italic> cells to assess whether it rescues growth inhibition by CD15-3.

BW27783 cells constitutively express arabinose transporters providing rather homogeneous response from the cell pool under arabinose induction (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Bhattacharyya et al., 2016</xref>). Interestingly, controlled expression of folA (encoding DHFR) under pBAD promoter with 0.005% arabinose induction partially rescued growth in a certain range of CD15-3 concentrations (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6A</xref>). This improvement of growth rate was less pronounced at higher concentration of CD15-3.

To that end, we used the same plasmid system (as was done for WT DHFR) with D27F variant under the pBAD-promoter and the expression was induced by 0.005% external arabinose (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib63">Rodrigues and Shakhnovich, 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib80">Tian et al., 2015</xref>). We found that no growth recovery from CD15-3-induced inhibition upon overexpression of the inactive DHFR variant. The dose response profile was similar to WT cells (with no DHFR overexpression), and same inhibition was observed at all concentrations of CD15-3 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6B</xref>). We conclude that loss of DHFR function in vivo due to inhibition by CD15-3 was responsible for partial loss of growth.</p><p>This result showed that inhibition of DHFR in vivo was, at least partially, responsible for inhibition of cellular growth induced by CD15-3. As TMP is a known inhibitor of DHFR (WT), we wanted to check if these overexpression plasmid systems behave in a similar way as in the case of CD15-3 inhibition. Overexpression of WT DHFR rescued growth of TMP-treated cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5s1">Figure 5—figure supplement 1</xref>), while no rescue of growth from TMP-induced inhibition was observed upon overexpression of inactive D27F variant (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5s1">Figure 5—figure supplement 1</xref>).</p><p>These results indicate that DHFR is an intracellular target for the new compound CD15-3. However, a possibility remains that CD15-3 does not target DHFR exclusively. To understand if CD15-3 is targeting cellular DHFR and thereby disrupting folA pathway, we further performed growth experiments in the presence of supplement folA mix. folA mix which is comprised of purine, thymine, glycine and methionine functions as a metabolic supplement for cells with diminished DHFR function (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib73">Singer et al., 1985</xref>). <italic>E. coli</italic> cells were grown in M9 media supplemented with ‘folA mix’ in presence and absence of CD15-3.

In the follow-up publication (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Chowdhury et al., 2021</xref>), we used system-level approaches to discover additional target of CD15-3, besides DHFR.</p></sec><sec id="s2-6"><title><italic>CD15-3 largely prevents evolution of resistance</italic> in <italic>E. coli</italic></title><p>The primary focus of our approach to design evolution drugs that constrains pathogen’s escape routes, is on the search for inhibitors of a single protein target which would be equally effective against WT and resistant variants,. To determine how fast WT <italic>E. coli</italic> can acquire resistance to CD15-3, we evolved three trajectories of <italic>E. coli</italic> under continuous exposure to the drug for over 1 month. We used a previously described automated serial passage protocol (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib63">Rodrigues and Shakhnovich, 2019</xref>) that adjusts the drug concentration in response to increase of growth rate caused by emergent resistant mutations thus maintaining evolutionary pressure to escape antibiotic stressor (see Materials and methods section for details). We found that, at early stages of evolution, the CD15-3 concentration necessary to reduce the growth rate of the culture to 50% (with respect to non-inhibited naïve cells) increased to a value about 2.7 times higher than the IC<sub>50</sub> of the naïve strain. However, at subsequent time points, the CD15-3 concentration remained constant, indicating that the cells were unable to further develop resistance to CD15-3. We found no mutations in the <italic>folA</italic> locus of the evolved strains upon Sanger sequencing, indicating that the modest increase in resistance to CD15-3 is not associated with target modification. In parallel, we also studied evolution of resistance to TMP in five independent trajectories using the same approach.

Sanger sequencing of the folA locus revealed point mutations in the folA locus in all trajectories. We found mutations in the DHFR active site, which are associated with resistance to TMP (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib56">Oz et al., 2014</xref>) and also in the promoter region, which are known to increase expression of DHFR (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib79">Tamer et al., 2019</xref>).</p><fig id="fig7" position="float"><label>Figure 7.</label><caption><title>Resistance to CD15-3 evolves slowly.</title><p>(<bold>A</bold>) Gray and red traces show evolution of antibiotic resistance against TMP and CD15-3, respectively.

Still IC<sub>50</sub> for these TMP escape mutants against CD15-3 is less than twofold higher compared to that of WT.</p><p>Further, we carried out a complementary plate-based ‘one-shot’ selection experiment from three independent starter cultures to determine if selection under CD15-3 stress leads to the emergence of colonies with mutations in the folA locus. WT naive cells were grown in M9 media without antibiotic to allow standing variation in the growing culture.

The assembly of these proteins have been reported to be identical to the AcrB, CusA(3):CusB(6):CusC(3) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Delmar et al., 2013</xref>). In the duplicated segment of the evolved variant, the entire cus-efflux system was found to be present.</p><p>We carried out the metabolic characterization of strains evolved in the presence of CD15-3 and naive strains by LC-MS to further investigate the mechanism of resistance to the drug (a detailed analysis is in a subsequent publication) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Chowdhury et al., 2021</xref>). Interestingly, we found markedly lower abundance of CD15-3 in the evolved strain compared to WT cells suggesting a possible efflux-pump-mediated compound depletion (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8">Figure 8C</xref>). After 4 hr of CD15-3 treatment, the abundance of the drug was found to be around 10% of the initial abundance. Drug efflux is a key mechanism of resistance in Gram-negative bacteria (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib52">Masi et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib67">Sandegren and Andersson, 2009</xref>). Pumping out drug compound under conditions of drug treatment is probably the most direct and nonspecific way of combating the toxic effect of a drug. It is interesting to note that we observed higher IC<sub>50</sub> in the evolved strain compared to the naïve strain for some other antibiotics which we tested. Both the na-ve and CD15-3-evolved cells were treated with TMP and Sulphamethoxazole. Sulphamethoxazole a sulfanilamide, is a structural analog of para-aminobenzoic acid (PABA) and binds to dihydropteroate synthetase. Under both treatment conditions, CD15-3-evolved cells partially escaped the drug inhibition and showed about threefold higher IC<sub>50</sub> for TMP and Sulphamethoxazole (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8">Figure 8D and E</xref>).These results show that the efflux mediated drug resistance in the evolved strain is non-specific. It demonstrates a potential strategy for antibiotic cross resistance and helps bacteria to escape inhibitory actions of CD15-3 and other antibacterial compounds with completely different protein targets. In the same vein, we note that the efflux pump mechanism shows only moderate increase of IC<sub>50</sub> for a variety of antibiotics in contrast to about 200-fold increase in several strains evolved under TMP (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7</xref>).</p></sec><sec id="s2-8"><title>Morphological changes induced by CD15-3 treatment</title><p>As cellular filamentation and concomitant morphological changes are one of the visible hallmarks of stress responses to inhibition of proteins on the folate pathway of which DHFR is a member,(<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Ahmad et al., 1998</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">Justice et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib68">Sangurdekar et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib90">Zaritsky et al., 2006</xref>) we proceeded to image <italic>E. coli</italic> cells in absence of CD15-3 (control) and with added CD15-3.

As efflux genes comprise 38 % of the duplicated genome segment (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="supp2">Supplementary file 2</xref>: Duplicated genome stretch) and CD15-3 abundance after 4 hours of treatment was markedly lower (compared to naive WT) an efflux-mediated drug resistance mechanism could potentially explain as to why evolved cells did not show any CD15-3-induced stressed morphology. The slight increase in median cell length in evolved cells upon treatment could be attributed to the fact that the transporter and efflux-pump-mediated resistance is a rather generic way to escape drug action and is limited in its ability to completely evade drug action.</p></sec></sec><sec id="s3" sec-type="discussion"><title>Discussion</title><p>Antibiotic resistance has emerged as a critical threat in the treatment of infectious diseases. This challenge is primarily an evolutionary problem which nails down to factors like antibiotic induced selection, the population structure of the evolving microbes and their genetics of adaptation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib64">Roemhild and Schulenburg, 2019</xref>). Horizontal gene transfer – another critical mechanism conferring antibiotic resistance (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Dzidic and Bedeković, 2003</xref>) in bacterial population – presents further complications. Traditional antibiotic design protocols and development pipelines do not essentially consider this high intrinsic potential of bacterial adaptation in antibiotic stressed growth conditions and hence do not properly address the problems associated with drug resistance. This problem has become more acute with the emergence of multidrug resistant bacteria which can potentially escape the actions of a wide array of antibiotic formulations and have a complex landscape of evolutionary adaptation.</p><p>To tackle these problems, complex treatment strategies for infectious diseases like combination-drug therapies or sequential drug therapies have been developed (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Baym et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib84">Vestergaard et al., 2016</xref>). These strategies are considered to be superior to classical monotherapies as instead of one protein target they aim at multiple molecular targets. It is interesting to note that natural product antibiotics like penicillin and other beta lactam drugs are inherently multi-target antibiotics (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib83">Tyers and Wright, 2019</xref>). Same applies to tetracyclin and aminoglycosides which targets bacterial ribosome and in turn interact with multiple ribosomal proteins (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Forge and Schacht, 2000</xref>). All these prompted interest in targeting multiple molecular targets with an aim to suppress the emergence of antibiotic resistance by target modification (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib72">Silver, 2007</xref>).</p><p>However, in many cases, these strategies enjoyed only limited success in constraining the emergence of evolutionary escape variants and rare multidrug variants (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Hegreness et al., 2008</xref>). Furthermore, none of these strategies act proactively by suppressing future evolutionary escape variants and remain more as a monotherapy in sequence or a combination therapy targeting WT variants.</p><p>Evolution drugs were envisioned as chemical formulations in the potential anti-evolution strategy which would prevent or delay evolution of drug resistance. Recent studies highlighted the bacterial evolutionary landscape under antibiotic induced selection pressure and the potential drug escape routes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Cao et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib57">Palmer et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib55">Ogbunugafor et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib62">Rodrigues et al., 2016</xref>). In a parallel development, the evolutionary dynamics of viral escape from drug or antibody stress was studied in silico and in vivo (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Doud et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Gaebler et al., 2021</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib45">Louie et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib50">Marchi et al., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib65">Rotem et al., 2018</xref>) This knowledge is critical to design better strategies to block the emergence of drug or antibody resistant phenotypes of pathogens.</p><p>One of the best-studied examples is evolving resistance to inhibitors of DHFR. Rapid clinical resistance to available antifolates like TMP emerges merely after three rounds of directed evolution and sequential fixation of mutations through ordered pathways has been shown to contribute to the evolutionary paths for antibiotic resistance (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib79">Tamer et al., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib81">Toprak et al., 2012</xref>). Even though several classes of small molecules have been investigated for their potential antifolate activity, the rapid emergence of resistance by readily accessible mutational pathways in the folA gene pose an immense challenge (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib81">Toprak et al., 2012</xref>). Several studies have shown that <italic>E. coli</italic> cells evolved in the presence of trimethoprim, a DHFR inhibitor, can become virtually insensitive to the drug upon successive accumulation of mutations in target gene. It is thus urgent to develop new tools for the systematic identification of novel scaffolds and discovery of inhibitors that interact simultaneously with both WT DHFR and antifolate resistant DHFR mutants. Importantly, the development of a biophysics-based quantitative model for the fitness landscape of DHFR (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib62">Rodrigues et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib63">Rodrigues and Shakhnovich, 2019</xref>) is a valuable tool to identify the target-resistant mutants that are the best candidates for drug design based on biophysical parameters of mutant proteins. The current work presents a design protocol and a multi-tool drug development pipeline which is motivated by these evolutionary understandings and presents a plausible strategy which aims at inhibiting both WT and evolutionary escape variants.</p><p>By an efficient virtual screening protocol to scan large databases, two hits of novel scaffolds were identified, which showed inhibitory activity against both WT and resistant mutant forms of DHFR. Unlike conventional approaches primarily focused on chemical synthesis of derivatives based on known inhibitor scaffolds (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Francesconi et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">Hopper et al., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib40">Lam et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib61">Reeve et al., 2016</xref>), we deployed a multi-tier approach to come up with chemically novel inhibitors. To further improve DHFR inhibitory activity of the two hits, a rapid round of compound optimization was conducted through a structural similarity search. This approach turned out to be effective as we tested only 12 candidate compounds and found CD15-3 with improved antimicrobial activity against both the WT and trimethoprim-resistant DHFR mutant <italic>E. coli</italic> strains. Among trimethoprim-resistant mutations, P21L, A26T, L28R, and their combinations recurrently appeared in two out of five independent evolution experiments, and their order of fixation in both cases was similar (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib81">Toprak et al., 2012</xref>). Fitness landscape of TMP resistance showed that the L28R variant is most resistant among all three single mutants (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib62">Rodrigues et al., 2016</xref>). Introduction of another mutation on the L28R background, either P21L or A26T, does not change IC<sub>50</sub> significantly (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib62">Rodrigues et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib81">Toprak et al., 2012</xref>). Thermal denaturation experiments demonstrate that L28R mutation is stabilizing showing an increase in Tm of 6°C above WT DHFR, in contrast to the destabilizing mutations P21L and A26T (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib62">Rodrigues et al., 2016</xref>). In addition, the L28R mutation cancels out the destabilization brought by P21L and A26T, restoring the Tm of the double and triple mutants to WT values. The L28R mutation also shows improved compactness, inferred from its reduced bis-ANS binding (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib62">Rodrigues et al., 2016</xref>). Thus, among the evolved mutant <italic>E. coli</italic> strains, L28R is one of the most frequently encountered resistance mutations in folA gene which render traditional anti-folate drugs like TMP clinically ineffective (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib48">Manna et al., 2021</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib62">Rodrigues et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib81">Toprak et al., 2012</xref>). Effectively L28R serves as a stability ‘reservoir’ providing a gateway to multiple evolutionary trajectories leading to resistance. The discovered DHFR inhibitor CD15-3 shows about threefold better efficacy than that of TMP on L28R <italic>E. coli</italic> variant strain, indicating its potential in combating resistance conferred by gateway point mutations of DHFR.</p><p>Our in vivo DHFR over-expression experiment showed partial recovery from the CD15-3-induced growth inhibition, thereby validating DHFR as a target for the intracellular inhibition by CD15-3. That DHFR is being targeted by CD15-3 is further supported by our imaging results showing antibiotic-stress-induced filamentation in the WT cells, a clear sign indicating that the folate pathway is indeed impacted by the drug (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Bhattacharyya et al., 2021</xref>). However, the <italic>partial</italic> recovery upon DHFR overexpression strongly suggests the presence of at least one additional protein target of CD15-3. As CD15-3 was designed to allow interaction with both WT and ‘modified’ active site pockets in the mutant forms of DHFR, this might make CD15-3 active against other enzymes that bind structurally similar substrates, most likely of the folate pathway. In a follow-up work, we present integrative metabolomic analysis that allowed us to identify additional targets of CD15-3 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Chowdhury et al., 2021</xref>).</p><p>In order to assess the validity of the strategy to design compounds that aims to constraint evolutionary escape routes we carried out 30-day long evolution experiments to evolve <italic>E. coli</italic> under CD15-3-induced stress. Unlike TMP resistance which emerged quickly and resulted in strains having 8- to 200-fold higher IC<sub>50</sub>, under CD15-3 <italic>E. coli</italic> evolved IC<sub>50</sub> which was only 2.7 times greater than WT. Further our whole genome sequence analysis revealed that there was no mutation in the target folA gene. Rather, we found that partial genome duplication of the region containing efflux pumps was responsible for evolution of modest resistance against CD15-3. The importance of efflux pump genes and transporters as first line of defence against antibiotic stressors was shown in studies where deletion of such genes leads to inferior mutational paths and escape strategies (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib46">Lukačišinová et al., 2020</xref>). The generic resistance phenotype observed in CD15-3-evolved cells could be potentially attributed to the multivalent nature of CD15-3. TMP specifically interacts with DHFR and hence mutation in the target loci (folA) provides an optimal solution to escape the TMP stress. As CD15-3 potentially interacts with at least one more target besides DHFR, point mutations in one of the target proteins do not provide optimal solutions. Hence resistance to CD15-3 is less likely to evolve through mutations in folA. While point mutations at multiple target loci can complicate the evolutionary fitness landscape, efflux-mediated resistance on the other hand provides a generic and rapid rescue strategy bypassing the need of multiple point mutations. However, this strategy apparently has its drawback as overexpression of additional pumps can incur fitness cost and lead to only modest two- to threefold increase in IC<sub>50</sub>.</p><p>Bacterial fitness/adaptation landscape under conditions of antibiotic induced stress could be complicated with multiple escape strategies. The method and the plausible solutions presented here aim to make common antifolate evolutionary escape route less accessible through missense mutations in the folA locus. Indeed CD15-3 was effective in constraining the escape routes involving target modifications by inhibiting the most potent DHFR escape mutants along with the WT form. Surprisingly, CD15-3 was equally effective in inhibiting growth of the TMP escape mutants which were not explicitly modeled at the computational design stage of this project such as D27E. CD15-3 also showed modest inhibition of W30R and W30C mutants emerged under TMP selection with IC<sub>50</sub> values less than twofold higher than the WT. It is interesting to note that the CD15-3 inhibitory activity extends beyond the DHFR variants that were initially selected as targets for structure-based design and that “unplanned” D27E and W30 mutants get inhibited with WT like efficacy.</p><p>Exploration of long-term evolutionary mechanism of potential escape from CD15-3 can help us understand the complexity of fitness landscape for this novel prospective antibiotic lead. This can further help in refining the drug development protocol which can also address the issue of efflux-mediated evolutionary escape routes. A plausible futuristic anti-evolution strategy could be using combination of potential evolution drug formulations like CD15-3 and adjuvants which could block the pumps, thereby potentially also obstructing the generic escape routes. Further this anti-evolution strategy in principle would be interesting to explore in the context of the currently known combination-drug therapy protocols extending its scope relevance and application. If CD15-3 has additional non-DHFR cellular target, it could serve as a monotherapy-mimic of a combination drug cocktail whose design is guided by evolutionary understanding based on recent insights into a short-term bacterial adaptation. We suggest that the currently popular drug development protocols could be improved to proactively account, at least partly, for bacterial adaptation.</p><p>As a caveat we note that novel compounds discovered here, while promising as candidates for new class of anti-evolution antibiotics, represents only initial leads in the drug development pipeline. A detailed characterization of pharmacokinetics of the prospective compound using the standard approaches adopted in pharmaceutical industry needs to be carried out to establish its plausibility as drug candidate. However, our approach that integrates computational and in vitro experimental components in a mutual feedback loop allows considerable power and flexibility in optimization of emerging compounds potentially significantly shortening the development cycle.</p><p>To summarize, we believe that the presented comprehensive multiscale-multitool approach can be an attractive starting point for further optimization and development of evolution drugs and adopting a broad strategy to combat evolution of drug resistance.</p></sec><sec id="s4" sec-type="materials|methods"><title>Materials and methods</title><sec id="s4-1"><title>Preparation of compound databases</title><p>Two commercially available databases ChemDiv (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://www.chemdiv.com/">http://www.chemdiv.com/</ext-link>, about 1.32 million compounds) and Life Chemicals (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://www.lifechemicals.com/">http://www.lifechemicals.com/</ext-link>, about 0.49 million compounds) were selected for virtual screening.

Firstly, the system was solvated in a water filled rhombic dodecahedron box with at least 12 Å distance between the complex and box edges. Then, the charges of system were neutralized by adding counter ions (Na+ or Cl-) by the genion tool in Gromacs. The system was then relaxed through an energy minimization process with steepest descent algorithm first, followed by a conjugate gradient algorithm. The energy of the system was minimized until the maximum force reached 5.0 kJ mol<sup>–1</sup> nm<sup>–1</sup>. After a primary constraint NVT simulation of 200 ps with protein atoms being fixed at 100 K, an NVT simulation of 400 ps without restraints was performed with simulated annealing at the temperature going from 100 to 300 K linearly.

The NADPH/NADP + as well as the substrates (most of them are MTX) are also shown. It can be seen that M20 loop constitutes part of the substrate binding site, so it will influence the binding of the substrates and its inhibitors. It has shown that the closed conformation is adopted when the substrate and cofactor are both bound (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Agarwal et al., 2002</xref>), where the M20 loop is packed against the nicotinamide ring of the cofactor. This is the only conformation where substrate and cofactor are arranged favorably for reaction and the following state of the catalytic cycle (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Agarwal et al., 2002</xref>) and also the only conformation that can be found in DHFR from all other species, regardless of the crystal packing and ligands bound positions in the binding site (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib69">Sawaya and Kraut, 1997</xref>). Observed in the product complexes, the occluded M20 loop is an unproductive conformation in which the central part of the M20 loop forms a helix that blocks access to the binding site for the nicotinamide moiety of the cofactor. Thus, the nicotinamide of the cofactor is forced out into solvent, making it unresolved in the crystal structures (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib69">Sawaya and Kraut, 1997</xref>). The open loop is a conformational intermediate between the extremes of the closed and occluded loops. The M20 loop dynamics plays a significant role in ligand binding and catalysis. It has become an area of great interest due to the persuasive evidence of conformational change in the loop during the catalytic cycle and its interaction with the substrate and cofactor (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib69">Sawaya and Kraut, 1997</xref>). However, it is still unknown which M20 loop conformation is a binding mode for inhibitors of <italic>E. coli</italic> DHFR. Whether binding single conformation or multiple conformations of the M20 loop leads to stronger binding is also not known. Thus, it is important to determine the target crystal structures that is most predictive for virtual screening investigation. Considering the conformation M20 loop, crystal structure resolution, as well as completeness of cognate ligands such as MTX or DDF and NADPH, we selected four M20 loop conformations (Closed: 1<italic>R</italic>X3, Open: 1RA3, Occluded: 1RC4 and 5CCC, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1</xref>) for the docking verification. Two occluded PDBs were selected because their M20 loop conformations did not overlap well. The feasibility of each M20 loop conformation was assessed by docking the known 183 <italic>E. coli</italic> DHFR inhibitors with IC<sub>50</sub> values ranging from 1 nM to 100 μM to the four representative PDB structures. As shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s2">Figure 1—figure supplement 2</xref> and <xref ref-type="table" rid="table4">Table 4</xref>, for docking score less than –10, the cumulative numbers of selected inhibitors were 22 for the closed M20 1<italic>RX</italic>3 – greater than for the open M20 1RA3 (10), and occluded M20 1RC4 (1) and 5CCC (13). In particular, when the cutoff of docking score was set to –9, using closed M20 1<italic>RX</italic>3 as target resulted in correct prediction of as many as 62 inhibitors compared to the open M20 1RA3 (25), and occluded M20 1RC4 (4) and 5CCC (32). At the higher cutoffs, open M20 1RA3 and occluded M20 5CCC showed comparable trends with that of closed M20 1<italic>R</italic>X3. However, even the M20 loop of 1RC4 and 5CCC both belong to the occluded conformation, their performance in docking of known ligands was strikingly different. It appears that 1RC4 performed much worse than 5CCC and it performed the worst compared to other target conformations. A possible reason could be that M20 loop in 1RC4 structure is closer to the substrate, making the binding pocket smaller to accommodate relatively large inhibitors. Further, we focused on the inhibitors with IC<sub>50</sub> values less than 1 μM. As seen from <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s2">Figure 1—figure supplement 2</xref> and 3, using the closed M20 1<italic>RX</italic>3 predicted about 58 % (42) out of the total of 72 the inhibitors, while the open M20 1RA3 only predicted 18 % (13), the occluded 1RC4 got 3 % (2) and the occluded 5CCC predicted about 18 % (13). Altogether these results demonstrate that the closed M20 1<italic>RX</italic>3 is more representative as a target for molecular docking of <italic>E. coli</italic> DHFR inhibitors.</p><table-wrap id="table4" position="float"><label>Table 4.</label><caption><title>Number of known inhibitors binding DHFR with different M20 loops through molecular docking.</title></caption><table frame="hsides" rules="groups"><thead><tr><th align="left" rowspan="2" valign="top">XP docking score threshold</th><th align="left" colspan="4" valign="top">All inhibitors (IC<sub>50</sub>: 1 nM~240 μM)</th><th align="left" colspan="4" valign="top">Inhibitors (IC<sub>50</sub> &lt;1 μM)</th></tr><tr><th align="left" valign="top">Closed (1<italic>RX</italic>3)</th><th align="left" valign="top">Open (1RA3)</th><th align="left" valign="top">Occluded (1RC4)</th><th align="left" valign="top">Occluded (5CCC)</th><th align="left" valign="top">Closed (1<italic>RX</italic>3)</th><th align="left" valign="top">Open (1RA3)</th><th align="left" valign="top">Occluded (1RC4)</th><th align="left" valign="top">Occluded (5CCC)</th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td align="char" char="ndash" valign="top"><bold>&lt;

Here, we use a similar protocol for <italic>E. coli</italic> DHFR. Eight known <italic>E. coli</italic> DHFR inhibitors (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s4">Figure 1—figure supplement 4</xref>) including MTX and TMP as well as other six compounds from <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Carroll et al., 2012</xref> with known Kd values were chosen for the construction of binding free energy prediction. The Pearson correlation coefficient (R) between the predicted and experimental binding free energies (ΔG = RTln(Kd), where R is the gas constant and T = 293.15 K) was used to evaluate the accuracy of the protocol developed in <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Cheron and Shakhnovich, 2017</xref>. TMP and Cmpd two as well as Cmpd 6 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s4">Figure 1—figure supplement 4</xref>) do not have crystal structures, their complexes were from molecular docking (TMP was docked to PDB 1<italic>RX</italic>3 and Cmpd 2 and 6 were docked to 3QYL). We used the available crystal structures of TMP complexed with Staphylococcus aureus DHFR (PDB: 2W9G, sequence identity with <italic>E. coli</italic> DHFR: 55/162 (34.0%) and sequence similarity: 92/162 (56.8%)) as a reference and found that the conformation of TMP docked with <italic>E. coli</italic> DHFR is only about 0.4 Å different from crystal structure with <italic>S. aureus</italic> DHFR (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s5">Figure 1—figure supplement 5</xref>), suggesting the accuracy of docked conformation for TMP. We first conducted two replicates of 10 ns simulation and then extended simulation length to 20 replicates. Two replicates of 10 ns simulation provided a quite strong correlation (<italic>R</italic> = 0.942) between the computational and experimental binding free energies (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1B</xref>) essentially indistinguishable from longer simulation comprised of 20 replicates of 10 ns runs in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s6">Figure 1—figure supplement 6</xref>. Thus, in subsequent simulations, a protocol consisting of two replicates of 10 ns was adopted. It can also be observed that the binding free energies followed a normal distribution (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s6">Figure 1—figure supplement 6</xref>) in both the short and long simulations, which indicates that the use of mean value to represent the general binding free energy is reasonable. An evolutionary study (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib56">Oz et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib81">Toprak et al., 2012</xref>) of TMP resistance found that three key resistance mutations P21L, A26T, L28R, and their combinations constitute a set that recurrently occurred in two out of five independent evolution experiments, and their order of fixation in both cases was similar. Although mechanisms leading to TMP resistance could be extremely complex and diverse, these sets of point mutations represent a simplistic model of in vitro evolution. These point mutations are located within the binding pocket of dihydrofolate substrate within a small region of eight residues in the DHFR protein that constitutes a flexible Met-20 loop (residues 9–24) and an α-helix (residues 25–35). Thus, the correlation coefficients between the computational and experimental binding free energies for TMP for the three mutants as well as their double and triple combinations were calculated. In addition, linear regression equation models to predict binding free energy for TMP against mutant DHFR originated from <italic>Listeria grayi</italic> and <italic>Chlamydia muridarum</italic> were also included. As shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s7">Figure 1—figure supplement 7</xref>, from two replicates of 10 ns simulation, the correlation coefficient (R) for <italic>L. grayi</italic> and <italic>C. muridarum</italic> DHFR were 0.895 and 0.839, respectively. The reason why the prediction for <italic>L. grayi</italic> and <italic>C. muridarum</italic> is somewhat inferior to <italic>E. coli</italic> DHFR (<italic>R</italic> = 0.953 from <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1C</xref> in the manuscript) may be that the protein-ligand complexes used for MD simulation are derived from molecular modeling rather than from crystal structures. Still, the values of binding free energy follow a normal distribution. Those models were used for scoring of virtual screening hits later.</p></sec><sec id="s4-4-2"><title>Selection of virtual screening hits</title><p>Structure-based virtual screening (SBVS) can quickly select compounds with reasonable binding patterns and higher predicted scores from a large number of compounds. According to the workflow (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1A</xref> in the manuscript), a total of about 1.8 million compounds from ChemDiv and Life Chemicals were screened for compliance with the Lipinski’s rule of five (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib49">Manto et al., 2018</xref>), resulting in about 1.5 million compounds. Then, a virtual screening process with three steps of different speed and precision including high throughput virtual screening (HTVS), standard precision (SP) and extra precision (XP) were respectively applied to the 1.5 million compounds. By setting different cutoff values for the HTVS of –5, SP of –7 and XP of –5, about 2900 compounds were obtained. The protein-ligand interaction of the crystal structures showed that Asp27 within the binding pocket is one of the most critical for forming hydrogen bond with known inhibitors. A total of 491 hits having contacts with Asp27 were filtered. After visual selection, 307 out of 491 compounds were submitted for the molecular dynamics evaluation using the previously selected DHFR crystal structure PDB 1<italic>R</italic>X3 as a target. Using the protocol described above, we predicted the binding affinities of all 307 compounds. With a cutoff value of less than –20kcal/mol, 40 compounds were chosen for further analysis. For those 40 compounds with 32 from the ChemDiv database and eight from the Life Chemicals database, we calculated their binding affinity for the WT and three single, three double and one triple mutants based on P21L, A26T, and L28R. Calculations predicted significant binding affinity for all compounds not only to the wild type DHFR, but also to the DHFR mutants.</p><p>Based on the principle that compounds with similar properties tend to have similar activity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">Kumar, 2011</xref>), and to ensure that the selected compounds with chemical novelty, three types of compound similarity based on Tanimoto coefficient (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib91">Zhang et al., 2013</xref>) were compared between the selected hits with that of the known 183 DHFR inhibitors. The Tanimoto coefficient uses the ratio of the intersecting set to the union set as the measure of similarity when each attribute is expressed in binary.

Two-dimensional (2D) physicochemical properties including molecular weight, AlogP, polar surface area, number of rotatable bonds, rings, aromatic rings, hydrogen acceptors and hydrogen donors were compared from the two-dimensional property’s aspect. Interaction similarity based on protein-ligand interaction (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">Huovinen et al., 1995</xref>) were calculated to ensure that the selected compounds form similar interactions with the critical binding site pocket residues which can further guarantee their biological activity. ECFP4 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib91">Zhang et al., 2013</xref>), an extended connectivity fingerprints which can represent the chemical diversity of compounds, was used to ensure the wide chemical space and novelty in their structures. As shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s8">Figure 1—figure supplement 8</xref>, the 2D physicochemical properties similarity were concentrated in the range of 0.6–0.8 and the protein-ligand interaction fingerprint (PLIF) similarities were mainly distributed in the range of 0.7–0.9 on the one hand, and the ECFP4 chemical similarities were only just between 0.2–0.3 on the other hand. This indicated that the selected hits were of similar 2D physicochemical property and protein-ligand binding interaction but also possessed chemical diversity compared with the known DHFR inhibitors. For detailed analysis of the 2D properties for the selected hits, the predicted values above mentioned properties including molecular weight, AlogP, polar surface area, number of rotatable bonds, rings, aromatic rings, hydrogen acceptors, and hydrogen donors were compared with that of the known DHFR inhibitors. It can be clearly seen from <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s9">Figure 1—figure supplement 9</xref> that those 2D properties showed similar distributions with the positive controls, further proving the effectiveness of the selected hits.

Human DHFR was purchased from Sigma Aldrich. In an initial screen, the compounds were assayed for inhibition of DHFR catalytic activity at a single fixed concentration of 200 µM. The reaction mixtures (100 μL final volume) contained 100 μM NADPH, 30 μM dihydrofolate and 100 mM HEPES, pH 7.3. The DHFR enzyme was added to initiate the reaction (16.7 nM final concentration) and the oxidation of NADPH was monitored at 25°C by the decrease in absorbance at 340 nm. The initial velocities with product formation less than 5% were measured and the nonenzymatic hydrolysis of NADPH was subtracted. The concentration-dependent inhibition curves were determined at variable concentration of each inhibitor. To minimize the interference at high compound concentrations, the rate of NADPH oxidation catalysed by DHFR was instead monitored by following the decrease in fluorescence at 450 nm (excitation 340 nm).

Your article has been reviewed by 3 peer reviewers, one of whom is a member of our Board of Reviewing Editors, and the evaluation has been overseen by George Perry as the Senior Editor. The reviewers have opted to remain anonymous.</p><p>The reviewers have discussed the reviews with one another and the Reviewing Editor has drafted this decision to help you prepare a revised submission.</p><p>As the editors have judged that your manuscript is of interest, but as described below that additional experiments are required before it is published, we would like to draw your attention to changes in our revision policy that we have made in response to COVID-19 (https://elifesciences.org/articles/57162). First, because many researchers have temporarily lost access to the labs, we will give authors as much time as they need to submit revised manuscripts. We are also offering, if you choose, to post the manuscript to bioRxiv (if it is not already there) along with this decision letter and a formal designation that the manuscript is &quot;in revision at <italic>eLife</italic>&quot;. Please let us know if you would like to pursue this option. (If your work is more suitable for medRxiv, you will need to post the preprint yourself, as the mechanisms for us to do so are still in development.)</p><p>Summary:</p><p>Antibiotic resistance can evolve rapidly and thus reduces the usefulness of many drugs that are otherwise effective. The development of new drugs that could slow down adaptation to antibiotics would significantly extend the life expectancy of current treatment strategies. Here, the authors identify, through computational analyses and experimental work, new chemical compounds that target the dihydrofolate reductase of <italic>E. coli</italic>, the known target of the common antibiotic trimethoprim. Contrary to trimethoprim, a new lead appears to lead very slowly to resistance. The authors present their strategy and findings as a way to develop 'evolution drugs'.</p><p>Essential revisions:</p><p>The reviewers raised many points that would need to be addressed for the manuscript to be considered further. I outline here the critical elements that are essential to address.</p><p>1) The new compounds are presented as new antibiotics in the context of medical application but they are active against the human DHFR and thus lack selectivity, which is a major issue in antibiotic development. The reviewers agree that because of this, this work could not be published under the theme of inhibitor development. It could potentially be rewritten as a model system for the examination strategies to delay the onset of resistance.</p><p>2) The number of mutants sequenced is not large enough to rule out the possibility that resistance can emerge through mutations in folA. In addition, some of the mutants come from the same adapted populations, which means that they are not an independent sampling of resistance mutants. The claim that resistance mechanisms are different from that of Trimethoprim and do not involve folA itself is therefore not supported.</p><p>3) Some of the information that would have been useful for the interpretation and evaluation of the current manuscript is to be published in an upcoming publication. It would be important for the reviewers to have access to this information. This would be possible for instance by providing a link to a preprint with this other paper.</p><p>4) The concept of evolution drug needs to be better defined to make sure the reader understands its scope and what it is bringing to the field.</p><p>We also transmit the detailed comments below.</p><p><italic>Reviewer #1:</italic></p><p>I cannot comment on the sections of the manuscript related to compound search and identification.</p><p>My general comment is about what makes an evolution drug exactly. From the definition given, it is a drug that works on mutants that are resistant to other drugs. Most antibiotics that interact slightly differently with the same target, or that have other modes of action altogether would therefore be evolution drugs? Since this is the aspect of the paper that makes it very original, I would need to better understand what this concept is, what it is not, and what novelty it brings.</p><p>My second critical comment regards the evolution experiment. I could not find exactly how many independent lines were evolved to resist the novel compound and how many were sequenced. The methods mention evolution in 96 well plates but from the results, it seems that only two mutants were sequenced. I believe that this is not enough to claim that this drug will not select for mutations in fola. To be able to show this, enough independent clones have to be sampled and sequenced to show that the space of resistance mutations has been completely sampled.</p><p>My third critical comment is that it seems that CD15-3 selects for mechanisms that lead to resistance to TMP as well, which is not something that you want for an evolution drug. This means that resistance to CD15-3 brings resistance to TMP as well if I understand well. How does this fit within the concept of evolution drugs? This would seem to make it a rather inefficient one.</p><p>Detailed comments: Panels of Figure 7 would need to be better labelled.</p><p>Many barplots are used to show estimates, for instance in figure 4. This is a representation that poorly represents the data. (https://journals.plos.org/plosbiology/article?id=10.1371/journal.pbio.1002128). I recommend alternatives are used and all data points are shown in addition to error bars (which are not defined here).</p><p><italic>Reviewer #2:</italic></p><p>The authors present a computational workflow that convincingly demonstrates the design and optimization of inhibitors to a key antibiotic target, such that the development of inhibitor resistance is clearly delayed. The experimental determination of inhibition in vitro, in cells and during the course of one month under evolutionary pressure with the new compounds was convincing. Unfortunately, the new inhibitors inhibit human DHFR more strongly. They would be toxic/lethal.</p><p>The authors could examine the inclusion of negative design (against inhibition of the human enzyme) in their workflow.</p><p>Since trimethoprim resistance is at the center of this research, and that the authors aim to develop an &quot;evolution drug&quot;, TMP-specific resistance should be described in greater depth. The specific context and reference given in the 2nd/3rd paragraphs of the introduction are: &quot;However, due to rapid emergence of resistant mutations in DHFR, the development of drug resistance to antifolate antibiotics belonging to any of the above-mentioned classes presents a significant challenge (Huovinen et al., 1995). Both clinical and in vitro studies have shown that accumulation of point mutations in critical amino acids residues of the binding cavity represent an important mode of trimethoprim resistance. Mutations conferring resistance in bacteria to anti-DHFR compounds are primarily located in the folA locus that encodes DHFR in <italic>E. coli</italic> (Oz et al., 2014; Tamer et al., 2019; Toprak et al., 2012) making DHFR an appealing target to develop evolution antibiotic drugs. » This view is now known to be incomplete. Crucially, the folA-related DfrA enzyme family should be introduced (as comprehensively described in Sánchez-Osuna et al., Microbial Genomics 2020;6) because clinical TMP resistance is more complex than point mutations to FolA as described by Huovinen. The intrinsically TMP-resistant DfrB family of DHFRs should also be mentioned as being part of the problem, although this work would not directly apply to it.</p><p>As a result of the new finding that TMP resistance is very diverse and does not result only from the recent evolution of point mutations as was previously thought, the approach presented here should be qualified. In the introduction (3rd paragraph): &quot;In this work, we developed an integrative computational modeling and biological evaluation workflow to discover novel DHFR inhibitors that are active against WT and resistant variants. » should qualify the resistant variants as being specifically directed to the point-mutated variants only, not all resistant variants that are genetically diverse.</p><p>It thus follows that the premise, as currently stated, is somewhat misleading. The introduction discusses clinical observation of antibiotic evolution. However, the point mutations under study are not particularly relevant to the natural evolution of TMP resistance (prior to introduction of TMP), or even its clinical evolution. This is clearly shown by the modest TMP resistance offered (Figure 2C). As described under Methods, section &quot;Construction of binding affinity prediction model&quot;: &quot;An evolutionary study (Oz et al., 2014; Toprak et al., 2012) of TMP resistance found that three key resistance mutations P21L, A26T, L28R, and their combinations constitute a set that recurrently occurred in two out of five independent evolution experiments, and their order of fixation in both cases was similar.&quot; This set of mutations constitutes a simple model system of in vitro evolution. This does not remove from the success of the inhibitor discovery and delay of onset of resistance, but it must be made clear that the premise is limited to in vitro evolution as a model of natural evolution, from the Abstract and throughout the body of the work.</p><p>Following Figure 1: &quot;…<italic>Listeria</italic> grayi (L. grayi) and Chlamydia muridarum (C. muridarum) again showing highly significant correlation between predicted and experimental values (Figure S7), demonstrating broad predictive power of the method&quot;. To highlight the relevance of the study, the choice of <italic>Listeria</italic> grayi and Chlamydia muridarum should be rationalized. The native resistance of L. grayi should be expressed; the choice of C. muridarum is not so clear. Importantly, what is their evolutionary distance with <italic>E. coli</italic> FolA? Therefore, do they demonstrate broad predictive power, as stated, and does it suggest that they are broadly efficient potential antibacterial leads (above Figure 3, regarding inhibition by CD15 and CD17)?</p><p>The authors chose to characterize the in vivo IC50 of the compounds. Since the role of compounds is to inhibit bacterial growth completely, minimal inhibitory concentration (MIC) and minimal bactericidal concentration (MBC) might be more relevant in this context and could be determined for the most interesting compounds, and different targets.</p><p>Suggestions and typographical:</p><p>– A recent review on 'classical' searches for inhibitors could be cited in the 2nd paragraph of the introduction: Wróbel, Arciszewska, Maliszewski and Drozdowska The Journal of Antibiotics volume 73, pages5-27(2020)</p><p>– Confusion in describing the activity test in vitro: in the body the authors describe fluorescence at 340 nm (Figure 2) whereas Methods describe the decrease in absorbance at 340 nm.

Their strategy consists of a computational approach to select promising candidates from known databases, followed by an experimental optimization and validation of the identified compounds. Interestingly, the first computational steps already narrowed down large chemical databases into a few relevant compounds, which are then shown to be efficient DHFR inhibitors in the experimental tests. Moreover, evolution of resistance to the resulting compound is shown to be much slower than resistance to trimethoprim.</p><p>The authors should address the following points (roughly in order of importance):</p><p>– An upcoming publication, in which a second molecular target of compound CD15-3 is revealed, is mentioned several times. It is slightly frustrating that these results, which may be key to understanding some of the phenomena reported in the present work (see below), are not included in this work. Why can this information not be included in the current article?</p><p>– Apart from non-synonymous mutations in folA, a common alternative way to evolve trimethoprim resistance is to overexpress DHFR. This happens in typical evolution experiments and in the clinic, for example through mutations that affect the folA promoter (see e.g. Toprak et al., Nature Genetics, 2012); this could also happen via duplication (or further amplification) of the folA gene. Figure 6 shows that, indeed, for the CD15-3 compound, overexpressing DHFR would actually allow the cell to recover from the effect of the compound. It is thus quite striking that no overexpression of DHFR seems to occur in the evolution experiments shown in figure 7A, where no mutation in folA fixes. The authors should comment on this in more detail. Could the other (mysterious) target of the drug explain this?</p><p>– How does the absolute value of the IC50 of the new compound compare with that of trimethoprim?</p><p>– The manuscript has a considerable amount of technical details in the main text, which makes it unnecessarily long and sometimes difficult to follow the main ideas. A shorter main text with fewer figures would considerably increase the clarity and accessibility of this work for non-experts (the details could be shifted to a supplement or appendix).</p><p>– In figure 3, a more explicative caption title would help the reader to quickly grasp the main conclusion from this figure.</p><p>– It is not completely clear in how far the approach presented in this work can be extended to other antibiotics and their resistance targets. It would be interesting to discuss this in more detail in the manuscript.</p><p>[Editors' note: further revisions were suggested prior to acceptance, as described below.]</p><p>Thank you for resubmitting your work entitled &quot;Development of antibacterial compounds that block evolutionary pathways to resistance&quot; for further consideration by <italic>eLife</italic>. Your revised article has been evaluated by George Perry (Senior Editor) and a Reviewing Editor.</p><p>The manuscript has been improved but there are some remaining issues that need to be addressed, as outlined below:</p><p>The reviewers and I appreciate the numerous modifications that were made to the manuscript. You will find below some comments from the reviewers. I will not reproduce them here because I believe they are all important and would need to be addressed. Also, I appreciated the additional experiment to isolate resistant mutants (Line 464). However, all mutants isolated come from the same culture, so it is not possible to know whether they are independent mutants. This experiment suffers from the same limitation as the previous experiment. Mutants from independent cultures would need to be isolated for them to be truly independent. The claim that resistance to CD15-3 does not evolve through mutations in folA would need to be expressed as &lt; resistance to CD15-3 is less likely to evolve through mutations in folA&gt; rather than &lt;does not evolve through mutations in folA&gt;. Saying that it does not happen would require a comprehensive analysis of mutants. The first comment of reviewer #3 also relates to this point.</p><p><italic>Reviewer #2:</italic></p><p>The authors made important improvements to the manuscript, addressing many key issues. In particular, demonstration of lack of inhibition of the human DHFR by CD15-3 is encouraging. This point should be highlighted by including the maximal concentration tested in footnote (b) of Table 1. The overall strategy is now better contextualized and has been strengthened by the additional data included in this version of the manuscript.</p><p>It is indeed interesting that (lines 712…) &quot;the CD15-3 inhibitory activity extends beyond the DHFR variants that were initially selected as targets for structure-based design and that &quot;unplanned&quot; D27E and W30 mutants get inhibited with WT like efficacy.&quot; The design strategy included known single/double mutations at positions 21, 26 and 28, indicated in Table 1; in the case of CD15-3 only one point mutant Ki was assessed. The Ki of CD15-3 for the other mutants used in the design strategy (Table 1) must be included, otherwise, there is no direct validation of the strategy. This is made obvious by the unclear conclusions of the cellular inhibition results, where the authors go to great lengths to attempt to isolate the effect of the inhibitors on DHFR in the cells (Section 'Target validation in vivo'). Therefore, validation of the strategy on the direct targets used in the design, the mutant DHFRs, should be done.</p><p><italic>Reviewer #3:</italic></p><p>The authors made a substantial effort and addressed most critical points in the revision. It is also very helpful that they made the preprint of the related article available online. However, there are a few remaining points that still need to be addressed:</p><p>– In their response, the authors speculate that, because of the second target of the compound, overexpression of folA would be a less optimal evolutionary solution. This is vague and still not clear because the data show that overexpression of folA is an easy way to increase resistance, irrespective of any other drug target. Moreover, in the second article they show that overexpressing the other target (folK) leads to even higher resistance to the drug. Thus, there is a similar issue: Why do solutions that overexpress this target (which should be easily accessible by promoter mutations or gene amplification) do not appear in the evolution experiments? I understand that it may not be possible to elucidate this in a reasonable time frame, but it should be clearly stated and discussed in detail in the manuscript (not just in the response to the reviewer comments). This point is important because it changes the main take-home message from &quot;It is not possible to evolve resistance to the new compound&quot; to &quot;There are the same straightforward ways to evolve resistance to the new compound as for trimethoprim but (for unknown reasons) they are not followed in evolution experiments.&quot;</p><p>– Another point that is addressed in the response to reviewers but still needs to be transparently stated and discussed in the revised manuscript is how the IC50 of the new compound compares to that of trimethoprim. The most helpful would be to show the dose-response curves for the new compound and for trimethoprim in the same plot with absolute concentrations on the x-axis. A similar plot that directly compares the effect of overexpressing folA on both dose-response curves would also help.</p></body></sub-article><sub-article article-type="reply" id="sa2"><front-stub><article-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.64518.sa2</article-id><title-group><article-title>Author response</article-title></title-group></front-stub><body><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Essential revisions:</p><p>The reviewers raised many points that would need to be addressed for the manuscript to be considered further.

Indeed any potential antibiotic lead has to exhibit selective activity against the bacterial protein and be inactive against its human orthologue. However the activity data we had earlier presented in our manuscript was of CD15, the parent compound for our lead CD15-3. The work essentially focuses on the potential of CD15-3 as an antibiotic lead. We assessed the CD15-3 activity against human DHFR and found that, unlike parent compound CD15, it does not inhibit human DHFR (Figure 4—figure supplement 1 in the manuscript) and hence shows selectivity against only bacterial DHFR.</p><p>CD15-3 structurally differs from CD15 with a naphthalene ring instead of a dimethoxy substituted benzene ring which can potentially explain loss of its with human DHFR. By comparison of the crystal structures of <italic>E. coli</italic> DHFR (PDB 1RX3) and human DHFR (PDB 1KMS), we found there are significant sequence differences between them in the ligand-binding domain. Different pairs of amino acids between <italic>E. coli</italic> DHFR and human DHFR include Met20: Leu22, Asp27: Glu30, Leu28: Phe31, Trp30: Tyr33, Ile94: Val115 (Figure 4—figure supplement 2 in the manuscript). From the binding of CD15 and CD15-3 against the two proteins, the loss of inhibition on human DHFR for CD15-3 is probably due to the loss of the pi-pi interaction with Phe31. As for the <italic>E. coli</italic> DHFR, the corresponding amino acid is Leu28, and it does not affect binding CD15-3.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>2) The number of mutants sequenced is not large enough to rule out the possibility that resistance can emerge through mutations in folA.

Indeed, in our last submission we presented limited evolution trajectories. In our current submission we have introduced two additional evolution trajectories. We carried out the same evolution experiments following the protocols earlier mentioned and allowed bacterial cells to evolve in presence of CD15-3 for over a month. Upon sequencing the “CD15-3-evolved” batch we did not observe any mutation in the folA locus. Further these evolved batches again showed a little more than two fold increases in IC<sub>50</sub> compared to the naïve cells, much lesser than the enhancement observed in the “TMP-evolved” batch (8 to 200 fold compared to the WT/naive).</p><p>In addition, we carried out an alternative strategy of “one-shot” selection of colonies that are capable of growth in presence of TMP or CD15-3. Again, colonies grown in presence of CD15-3 do not show variation in the folA locus (see new Table 3 and accompanying discussion) and show a lower increase in resistance when compared to TMP.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>3) Some of the information that would have been useful for the interpretation and evaluation of the current manuscript is to be published in an upcoming publication.

In our earlier submission we had briefly mentioned what “evolution-drugs” mean and we have re-formatted that section. Also we have clarified the concept in the direction which reviewer had mentioned.</p><p>Conceptually “evolution drug” is a compound which stresses pathogens or cancer cells and suppresses their evolutionary pathways to escape. Antibiotic resistance or drug resistance in general is an evolutionary selection of phenotype which evades the drug action by deploying multiple molecular level escape strategies. These strategies could be as general as efficient efflux of the drug or specific like mutation of the target locus resulting in the target protein modification which would eliminate binding of the antibiotic molecule. In our study we designed a strategy to have antibiotic leads which would not only interact with the WT protein but would interact with a subset of target protein escape variants. Since compounds designed like this can potentially block the evolutionary escape routes of bacterial cells growing under antibiotic selection, the strategy could be potentially promising to block the emergence of “antibiotic-resistant” bacterial phenotypes.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>My second critical comment regards the evolution experiment. I could not find exactly how many independent lines were evolved to resist the novel compound and how many were sequenced. The methods mention evolution in 96 well plates but from the results, it seems that only two mutants were sequenced. I believe that this is not enough to claim that this drug will not select for mutations in fola. To be able to show this, enough independent clones have to be sampled and sequenced to show that the space of resistance mutations has been completely sampled.</p></disp-quote><p>We thank the reviewer for pointing out this issue. In our previous submission we had presented one evolution trajectory/line. Two colonies obtained after plating the evolved batch were selected and sequenced. In our current submission we have added two more evolution trajectories and we did not observe any mutation in the folA locus. Also we have carried out a parallel plate based study (new Table 3 and accompanying discussion) and found the colonies formed on CD15-3 plate do not have mutation in the folA locus compared to the ones on TMP plate which had mutations in the folA locus.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>My third critical comment is that it seems that CD15-3 selects for mechanisms that lead to resistance to TMP as well, which is not something that you want for an evolution drug. This means that resistance to CD15-3 brings resistance to TMP as well if I understand well. How does this fit within the concept of evolution drugs? This would seem to make it a rather inefficient one.</p></disp-quote><p>We thank the reviewer for this point and appreciate the observation. It is true that CD15-3 escape/evolved variant offered moderate resistance to TMP as was evident from 3 fold enhanced IC<sub>50</sub> compared to that of the naïve cells. But this resistance could be attributed to the transporters and pumps which constituted around 38% of the genes in the duplicated segment. This is a very generic mechanism by which evolving bacterial cells neutralize the toxicity of the drugs. We showed that a 30+ days of evolution under CD15-3 leads to the modest increase in IC<sub>50</sub> but it does not involve any mutation in the folA locus. It is interesting to note that CD15-3 unlike TMP was not only designed to inhibit WT DHFR but also some prominent mutants of DHFR which emerge under TMP selection. Since CD15-3 significantly constraints the escape routes associated with folA locus mutation, it is likely that the resistance would emerge by generic mechanisms as mediated by efflux in the current variants.</p><p>Further CD15-3 significantly delayed the onset of resistance as the IC<sub>50</sub> of the evolved variants were just 2 times compared to the naïve cells. During the same timescale of evolution, the IC<sub>50</sub> of the TMP escape variants went to 8 to 200 times higher compared to that of the naïve cells.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Detailed comments: Panels of Figure 7 would need to be better labelled.</p><p>Many barplots are used to show estimates, for instance in figure 4. This is a representation that poorly represents the data. (https://journals.plos.org/plosbiology/article?id=10.1371/journal.pbio.1002128).

The experimental determination of inhibition in vitro, in cells and during the course of one month under evolutionary pressure with the new compounds was convincing. Unfortunately, the new inhibitors inhibit human DHFR more strongly. They would be toxic/lethal.</p><p>The authors could examine the inclusion of negative design (against inhibition of the human enzyme) in their workflow.</p></disp-quote><p>We thank the reviewer for pointing out this concern. Table 1 in our earlier submission primarily documented the CD15 activity profile. It is to be noted that CD15-3 which we present as the potential antibiotic lead is a derivative of CD15. We carefully measured the activity of CD15-3 against human DHFR and found that CD15-3 does not show any inhibitory activity (see Figure 4—figure supplement 1 in the manuscript). Also in the current submission we have incorporated a table showing the in vitro activity profile of CD15-3.</p><p>Indeed in our earlier submission when we tried to find novel <italic>E. coli</italic> DHFR inhibitors, their activity against human DHFR were not considered in the computational search. We only used the <italic>E. coli</italic> DHFR crystal structure for the virtual screening. Later we tested CD15-3 against human DHFR and found that CD15-3 unlike CD15 did not inhibit human DHFR activity.</p><p>We thank the reviewer for the valuable suggestion on negative design. We would include a negative design in later steps of the screening workflow in our future efforts and calculate the binding activity of the hit compounds against human DHFR and remove those compounds with high affinity against human DHFR.</p><p>But in this work, since the hits were already screened, so we would like to try to use this method to further optimize the hits to improve their activity. Nevertheless, we calculated the binding free energy of TMP against <italic>E. coli</italic> WT and L28R DHFR and human DHFR by using molecular dynamics and MM/PBSA. We found that the binding free energy for TMP is lower on the human DHFR than on <italic>E. coli</italic> WT and L28R DHFR. This can partly explain why TMP is highly potent against microbial DHFRs than the human DHFR.

The specific context and reference given in the 2nd/3rd paragraphs of the introduction are: &quot;However, due to rapid emergence of resistant mutations in DHFR, the development of drug resistance to antifolate antibiotics belonging to any of the above-mentioned classes presents a significant challenge (Huovinen et al., 1995). Both clinical and in vitro studies have shown that accumulation of point mutations in critical amino acids residues of the binding cavity represent an important mode of trimethoprim resistance. Mutations conferring resistance in bacteria to anti-DHFR compounds are primarily located in the folA locus that encodes DHFR in <italic>E. coli</italic> (Oz et al., 2014; Tamer et al., 2019; Toprak et al., 2012) making DHFR an appealing target to develop evolution antibiotic drugs. » This view is now known to be incomplete. Crucially, the folA-related DfrA enzyme family should be introduced (as comprehensively described in Sánchez-Osuna et al., Microbial Genomics 2020;6) because clinical TMP resistance is more complex than point mutations to FolA as described by Huovinen. The intrinsically TMP-resistant DfrB family of DHFRs should also be mentioned as being part of the problem, although this work would not directly apply to it.</p><p>As a result of the new finding that TMP resistance is very diverse and does not result only from the recent evolution of point mutations as was previously thought, the approach presented here should be qualified. In the introduction (3rd paragraph): &quot;In this work, we developed an integrative computational modeling and biological evaluation workflow to discover novel DHFR inhibitors that are active against WT and resistant variants. » should qualify the resistant variants as being specifically directed to the point-mutated variants only, not all resistant variants that are genetically diverse.</p><p>It thus follows that the premise, as currently stated, is somewhat misleading. The introduction discusses clinical observation of antibiotic evolution. However, the point mutations under study are not particularly relevant to the natural evolution of TMP resistance (prior to introduction of TMP), or even its clinical evolution. This is clearly shown by the modest TMP resistance offered (Figure 2C). As described under Methods, section &quot;Construction of binding affinity prediction model&quot;: &quot;An evolutionary study (Oz et al., 2014; Toprak et al., 2012) of TMP resistance found that three key resistance mutations P21L, A26T, L28R, and their combinations constitute a set that recurrently occurred in two out of five independent evolution experiments, and their order of fixation in both cases was similar.&quot; This set of mutations constitutes a simple model system of in vitro evolution. This does not remove from the success of the inhibitor discovery and delay of onset of resistance, but it must be made clear that the premise is limited to in vitro evolution as a model of natural evolution, from the Abstract and throughout the body of the work.</p></disp-quote><p>We thank the reviewer for this extensive suggestion on better putting the perspective of resistance against TMP. It is true that the TMP resistance under clinical setting is far more complex and the recent studies cited are extremely insightful in that direction. We have re-drafted the sections pointed and included the studies suggested. In particular we note in lines 94-95 “In our current study we focus on a simplified model system of in vitro evolution whereby resistant phenotypes emerge from point mutations in the folA locus.”</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Following Figure 1: &quot;…Listeria grayi (L. grayi) and Chlamydia muridarum (C. muridarum) again showing highly significant correlation between predicted and experimental values (Figure S7), demonstrating broad predictive power of the method&quot;.

The native resistance of L. grayi should be expressed; the choice of C. muridarum is not so clear. Importantly, what is their evolutionary distance with <italic>E. coli</italic> FolA? Therefore, do they demonstrate broad predictive power, as stated, and does it suggest that they are broadly efficient potential antibacterial leads (above Figure 3, regarding inhibition by CD15 and CD17)?</p></disp-quote><p>We thank the reviewer for the important point raised. The reason why we also include <italic>Listeria</italic> grayi (L. grayi) and Chlamydia muridarum (C. muridarum) for verifying the binding affinity prediction linear model is as follows.</p><p>In one of the former study from the group (Rodrigues et al., 2016) depicting broader view of the biophysical nature of the fitness landscape of antibiotic resistance we transformed <italic>E. coli</italic> cells with plasmids overexpressing DHFR from two mesophilic bacteria viz.

Also, we obtained the inhibition data for TMP against WT and three point mutant DHFR from <italic>E. coli</italic>, <italic>C. Muridarum</italic> and <italic>L. grayi</italic> respectively, which enabled us to construct the binding affinity prediction linear models. And our results (Figure 1, Figure 1—figure supplement 4, 6 and 7) show that highly significant correlations between predicted and experimental values are obtained for all three species, demonstrating broad predictive power of the method.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>The authors chose to characterize the in vivo IC50 of the compounds.

Their strategy consists of a computational approach to select promising candidates from known databases, followed by an experimental optimization and validation of the identified compounds. Interestingly, the first computational steps already narrowed down large chemical databases into a few relevant compounds, which are then shown to be efficient DHFR inhibitors in the experimental tests. Moreover, evolution of resistance to the resulting compound is shown to be much slower than resistance to trimethoprim.</p><p>The authors should address the following points (roughly in order of importance):</p><p>– An upcoming publication, in which a second molecular target of compound CD15-3 is revealed, is mentioned several times. It is slightly frustrating that these results, which may be key to understanding some of the phenomena reported in the present work (see below), are not included in this work. Why can this information not be included in the current article?</p></disp-quote><p>We thank the reviewer for the point mentioned. In our current submission we have provided the link to our pre-print “(Chowdhury et al., 2021)” at relevant places in the manuscript.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>– Apart from non-synonymous mutations in folA, a common alternative way to evolve trimethoprim resistance is to overexpress DHFR. This happens in typical evolution experiments and in the clinic, for example through mutations that affect the folA promoter (see e.g. Toprak et al., Nature Genetics, 2012); this could also happen via duplication (or further amplification) of the folA gene. Figure 6 shows that, indeed, for the CD15-3 compound, overexpressing DHFR would actually allow the cell to recover from the effect of the compound. It is thus quite striking that no overexpression of DHFR seems to occur in the evolution experiments shown in figure 7A, where no mutation in folA fixes. The authors should comment on this in more detail. Could the other (mysterious) target of the drug explain this?</p></disp-quote><p>We thank the reviewer for this observation. It is true that a common way to evolve resistant against anti-folates like TMP is to overexpress DHFR. We did not observe any overexpression DHFR due to upstream mutation and it could be because that CD15-3 has an additional non-DHFR intra-cellular target (Chowdhury et al., 2021). This makes resistance by gene overexpression a less evolutionarily optimal solution. Resistance by overexpressing the pumps constituting the gene-duplicated segment provides a much more generic solution leading to CD15-3 resistance.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>– How does the absolute value of the IC50 of the new compound compare with that of trimethoprim?</p></disp-quote><p>It is about 100 fold higher but the relevant comparison is with escape variants such as L28R where it is 3 fold lower than TMP.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>– The manuscript has a considerable amount of technical details in the main text, which makes it unnecessarily long and sometimes difficult to follow the main ideas.

You will find below some comments from the reviewers. I will not reproduce them here because I believe they are all important and would need to be addressed. Also, I appreciated the additional experiment to isolate resistant mutants (Line 464). However, all mutants isolated come from the same culture, so it is not possible to know whether they are independent mutants. This experiment suffers from the same limitation as the previous experiment. Mutants from independent cultures would need to be isolated for them to be truly independent. The claim that resistance to CD15-3 does not evolve through mutations in folA would need to be expressed as &lt; resistance to CD15-3 is less likely to evolve through mutations in folA&gt; rather than &lt;does not evolve through mutations in folA&gt;. Saying that it does not happen would require a comprehensive analysis of mutants. The first comment of reviewer #3 also relates to this point.</p></disp-quote><p>Thank you for pointing this out. Now we included the results from two more independent starter-cultures. As before, we did not observe any mutation in the folA locus under the conditions of “one-shot” CD15-3 selection.</p><p>Further, we changed/rephrased sections expressing “does not evolve through mutations in folA” to “resistance to CD15-3 is less likely to evolve through mutations in folA” (lines 712 and 719 to 723) as correctly pointed out by the editor.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Reviewer #2:</p><p>The authors made important improvements to the manuscript, addressing many key issues. In particular, demonstration of lack of inhibition of the human DHFR by CD15-3 is encouraging. This point should be highlighted by including the maximal concentration tested in footnote (b) of Table 1. The overall strategy is now better contextualized and has been strengthened by the additional data included in this version of the manuscript.</p><p>It is indeed interesting that (lines 712…) &quot;the CD15-3 inhibitory activity extends beyond the DHFR variants that were initially selected as targets for structure-based design and that &quot;unplanned&quot; D27E and W30 mutants get inhibited with WT like efficacy.&quot; The design strategy included known single/double mutations at positions 21, 26 and 28, indicated in Table 1; in the case of CD15-3 only one point mutant Ki was assessed. The Ki of CD15-3 for the other mutants used in the design strategy (Table 1) must be included, otherwise, there is no direct validation of the strategy. This is made obvious by the unclear conclusions of the cellular inhibition results, where the authors go to great lengths to attempt to isolate the effect of the inhibitors on DHFR in the cells (Section 'Target validation in vivo'). Therefore, validation of the strategy on the direct targets used in the design, the mutant DHFRs, should be done.</p></disp-quote><p>We thank the reviewer for pointing out this oversight. In our current submission we added the Ki of CD15-3 for two additional mutants’ viz. P21L and A26T, (Table 1) which were included in our original CD15-3 design scheme.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Reviewer #3:</p><p>The authors made a substantial effort and addressed most critical points in the revision. It is also very helpful that they made the preprint of the related article available online. However, there are a few remaining points that still need to be addressed:</p><p>– In their response, the authors speculate that, because of the second target of the compound, overexpression of folA would be a less optimal evolutionary solution. This is vague and still not clear because the data show that overexpression of folA is an easy way to increase resistance, irrespective of any other drug target. Moreover, in the second article they show that overexpressing the other target (folK) leads to even higher resistance to the drug. Thus, there is a similar issue: Why do solutions that overexpress this target (which should be easily accessible by promoter mutations or gene amplification) do not appear in the evolution experiments? I understand that it may not be possible to elucidate this in a reasonable time frame, but it should be clearly stated and discussed in detail in the manuscript (not just in the response to the reviewer comments). This point is important because it changes the main take-home message from &quot;It is not possible to evolve resistance to the new compound&quot; to &quot;There are the same straightforward ways to evolve resistance to the new compound as for trimethoprim but (for unknown reasons) they are not followed in evolution experiments.&quot;</p></disp-quote><p>We thank the reviewer for his critical comments. We have rephrased the relevant sections in the manuscript as per the suggestion. (Lines 101-102, 712, 720-724).</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>– Another point that is addressed in the response to reviewers but still needs to be transparently stated and discussed in the revised manuscript is how the IC50 of the new compound compares to that of trimethoprim. The most helpful would be to show the dose-response curves for the new compound and for trimethoprim in the same plot with absolute concentrations on the x-axis. A similar plot that directly compares the effect of overexpressing folA on both dose-response curves would also help.</p></disp-quote><p>We thank the reviewer for this point. In figure 4E we have provided a comparative bar-plot of IC<sub>50</sub> values for TMP and CD15-3. Since TMP shows efficacy at a nano-molar level compared to micro-molar levels of CD15-3, a cumulative dose response plot is otherwise hard to plot.</p></body></sub-article></article>
