When these processes include cultural transmission, the social learning of information or behaviours from conspecifics, songs can undergo rapid evolutions because cultural novelties can emerge more frequently than genetic mutations. Understanding these song variations over large temporal and spatial scales can provide insights into the patterns, drivers and limits of song evolution that can ultimately inform on the species’ capacity to adapt to rapidly changing acoustic environments. Here, we analysed changes in fin whale (<italic>Balaenoptera physalus</italic>) songs recorded over two decades across the central and eastern North Atlantic Ocean. We document a rapid replacement of song INIs (inter-note intervals) over just four singing seasons, that co-occurred with hybrid songs (with both INIs), and a clear geographic gradient in the occurrence of different song INIs during the transition period. We also found gradual changes in INIs and note frequencies over more than a decade with fin whales adopting song changes. These results provide evidence of vocal learning in fin whales and reveal patterns of song evolution that raise questions on the limits of song variation in this species.</p></abstract><kwd-group

can change within and between populations through different evolutionary processes. These processes can be selective (i.e. sexual, cultural, or natural selection), favouring song changes that confer advantages to singers, or non-selective (i.e. cultural or genetic drift), causing random changes in songs. Both selective and non-selective processes may result in rapid and gradual population-wide shifts in the structure, complexity, frequency, and temporal properties of songs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Garland et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib48">Otter et al., 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib71">Whiten, 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib73">Williams et al., 2013</xref>), although song evolution can also be constrained by the species’ genetic variation and mechanical design (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib54">Podos et al., 2004</xref>).</p><p>The best-known examples of song evolution are found among songbirds, which field studies started decades ago and have led to extensive literature on the topic. Songs from many songbirds are culturally transmitted through vocal learning, wherein animals learn to sing by hearing and imitating conspecifics (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib74">Williams, 2021</xref>). Vocal learning and specific patterns of dispersal are largely responsible for the geographic variation found in songs of many bird species (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib55">Podos and Warren, 2007</xref>). The formation of local dialects is, in part, a consequence of certain mechanisms of song learning (i.e., copying ‘errors’) that generate vocal novelties (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib55">Podos and Warren, 2007</xref>). Learned songs may also undergo rapid evolutions within populations, basically because cultural novelties can emerge more frequently than genetic mutations (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib72">Wilkins et al., 2013</xref>). One example of rapid song evolution is found in the white-throated sparrow (<italic>Zonotrichia albicollis</italic>), in which a new doublet ending song spread across the North America continent in less than 20 years, completely replacing the established triplet-ending song. This fast spread is believed to have occurred because birds singing the old and new songs overwintered in the same grounds and learned from each other. Although it remains unclear why the new song overturned the old song, one possible explanation for this rapid song transition is that certain innovations are adopted non-randomly by all males to maintain female interest (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib48">Otter et al., 2020</xref>). Birdsong properties can also show a gradual directional evolution in response to specific evolutionary process. A clear example are birds from urban areas, which song elements increase in frequency (Hz) in response to noisy environmental conditions (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib63">Slabbekoorn, 2013</xref>). Directional song evolution can also cause directional song changes (e.g. faster trill rates, broader frequency bands, and lower frequency trills) driven by sexual selection operating through male-male interactions, mate choice by females or both (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">de Kort et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Illes et al., 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib73">Williams et al., 2013</xref>). Yet, all these song variations are constrained by the singers’ morphological (e.g. beak shape or body size) and neurological limitations that sometimes can hinder the animals’ adaptation to rapid human induced changes in the environment (e.g. urban noise; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Luther and Derryberry, 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib54">Podos et al., 2004</xref>).</p><p>A parallelism to birdsong evolution can be found in the marine realm. Songs from humpback whales (<italic>Megaptera novaeangliae</italic>) differ across ocean regions (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib75">Winn et al., 1981</xref>), evolve gradually over time (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib51">Payne et al., 1983</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib52">Payne and Payne, 1985</xref>) and can go through revolutionary changes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib46">Noad et al., 2000</xref>). During song revolutions, a population song type is rapidly replaced by a novel song type introduced from a neighbouring population (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Garland et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib46">Noad et al., 2000</xref>). Most authors agree that these spatial and temporal patterns in humpback whale song changes can only be explained by vocal learning (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Garland et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Janik and Knörnschild, 2021</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib46">Noad et al., 2000</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib66">Tyack, 2008</xref>). Yet, the learning capacity of novel songs in humpback whales may be limited because song complexity always decreases in each revolutionary event (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Allen et al., 2018</xref>).</p><p>Compared to humpback whales and most songbirds, fin whales (<italic>Balaenoptera physalus</italic>) produce simpler songs consisting of a stereotyped repetition of a few low-frequency note types. These songs are also believed to act as mating displays (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib65">Thompson et al., 1992</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib69">Watkins et al., 1987</xref>), because they are produced by males (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Croll et al., 2002</xref>) and intensify during the breeding season (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">Lockyer, 1984</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib61">Širović et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib65">Thompson et al., 1992</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib69">Watkins et al., 1987</xref>). In this species, the song inter-note interval (INI) is the most distinctive parameter between regions (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Castellote et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Delarue et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Hatch and Clark, 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib62">Širović et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib69">Watkins et al., 1987</xref>) and has been used to differentiate stocks and populations (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Castellote et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Delarue et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib41">Morano et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib62">Širović et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib76">Wood and Širović, 2022</xref>). Previous studies showed that fin whale song INIs differed between western, central, and eastern North Atlantic areas, as well as between these and the Mediterranean Sea (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Castellote et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Delarue et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Hatch and Clark, 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib41">Morano et al., 2012</xref>). These results partially agree with genetic data that indicate significant levels of heterogeneity in the mitochondrial DNA between the Mediterranean Sea, the eastern (Spain), and the western (Gulf of Maine and Gulf of St Lawrence) North Atlantic; however, samples from West Greenland and Iceland could not be assigned to either of the two North Atlantic areas, suggesting a mixture of subpopulations in these feeding grounds (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Bérubé et al., 1998</xref>). Another large-scale study combining fin whale genetic and song data from the Northeast Pacific, North Atlantic, and Mediterranean Sea showed that acoustic differentiation among fin whales were not always reflected in estimates of genetic divergence (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Hatch and Clark, 2004</xref>). These authors concluded that differences in songs may reflect differences in fin whale movements and/or social and vocal behaviours that occur at shorter timescales than genome evolution. In fact, fin whale song INIs can change abruptly from one year to the next in the same region (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Delarue et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Hatch and Clark, 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Helble et al., 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib41">Morano et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib62">Širović et al., 2017</xref>) and have been progressively changing over time in different ocean regions (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Best et al., 2022</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Helble et al., 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Leroy et al., 2018a</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib70">Weirathmueller et al., 2017</xref>). Also, the center frequencies of two fin whale song components, the 20 Hz note and the higher frequency (~130 Hz) upsweep (hereafter HF note; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Hatch and Clark, 2004</xref>), have been decreasing gradually over the last decade in different ocean basins (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Leroy et al., 2018a</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib70">Weirathmueller et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib76">Wood and Širović, 2022</xref>).</p><p>Currently, we do not understand the mechanisms and drivers of fin whale song variations nor how these variations may be affected by the species’ physiological and morphological constraints of vocal performance. Broad-scale studies matching the known scales of fin whale natural history and ecology can shed light into the species’ population structure and demography, even before genetic differentiation is evident, and elucidate patterns, drivers and limits of song evolution that can ultimately inform on the species’ capacity to adapt to human-induced changes in their acoustic habitats (e.g. anthropogenic noise and climate change).</p><p>Our study attempts to address these issues by investigating changes over two decades of three fin whale song parameters (INIs and peak frequencies of the 20 Hz and HF note types) in a wide area of the North Atlantic Ocean. Our work provides evidence of social learning in fin whale songs and shows: (i) a rapid evolution in song INIs across a vast area of the central North Atlantic in just four singing seasons, with the existence of hybrid songs (including both INIs) and a clear geographic gradient of song INIs during the transition period; (ii) a gradual evolution of song parameters showing an increase in INIs and a decrease in frequencies of the 20 Hz and HF notes over more than a decade in the central and eastern North Atlantic; and (iii) the adoption of both rapid and gradual song changes by fin whales from a wide region. We conclude by discussing song changes under the scope of cultural transmission, song function and the limits of song variation.</p></sec><sec id="s2" sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><p>The processing across all acoustic data resulted in 379 songs, from which 39680 INIs and its corresponding note frequencies were measured, and 143 songs, from which 9185 HF note peak frequencies were measured (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="supp1">Supplementary file 1a</xref>; ‘Materials and methods’).

Decoupled variations in song INIs and frequency (i.e. INIs changed abruptly but frequencies did not) reveal the complex interplay between different selective pressures and shed some light on the potential limits of song variation.</p><p>The rapid replacement of fin whales’ song INIs (from 19s to 12s) described here for the ONA region cannot be explained by environmental causation. The shift in INIs found in the ONA region seemed to occur simultaneously at northern feeding grounds, in the so-called Northeast North Atlantic (NENA) region (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Hatch and Clark, 2004</xref>). This variation in INI patterns during the same singing season between neighbouring locations within ONA, together with an identical shift in INIs documented for the same period in the environmentally distant NENA region (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Hatch and Clark, 2004</xref>), strongly suggest that the transition in INIs was not a response to local acoustic environments. Fin whale song INIs are regionally distinct (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Castellote et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Constaratas et al., 2021</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Delarue et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Hatch and Clark, 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib41">Morano et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib53">Pereira et al., 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib62">Širović et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib68">Víkingsson and Gunnlaugsson, 2006</xref>) and the shift in INIs found in our study could have been caused by a population replacement. However, if this was the case, we would not find hybrid songs containing both INIs during the transition period, as the new song pattern would simply substitute the former, as documented for fin whale songs off Southern California (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib62">Širović et al., 2017</xref>). Multiyear and seasonal alternation of different fin whale song INIs, with presence of hybrid songs, have also been reported in two regions of the Northwest Atlantic. In both cases, authors suggest INI shifts occurred within the same population (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Delarue et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib41">Morano et al., 2012</xref>). Thus, we suggest that the rapid turnover of fin whale song INIs along a spatial gradient in the ONA region, with males adopting the new song INI, and the existence of hybrid songs, is the result of cultural transmission, the social learning of information or behaviours from conspecifics (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib57">Rendell and Whitehead, 2001</xref>).</p><p>Our study also shows that fin whale song INIs from the distant Barents Sea region differ from the rest of the sampled area (central and eastern North Atlantic). Geographic differentiation in song INIs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Hatch and Clark, 2004</xref>) with fin whales within a certain area conforming the same INI has been widely documented (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Castellote et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Delarue et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Hatch and Clark, 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib62">Širović et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib76">Wood and Širović, 2022</xref>). Bird songs also vary geographically, and this variation can be largely attributed to their ability of learning to vocalize through imitation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Kroodsma, 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib55">Podos and Warren, 2007</xref>). When songbirds learn their songs from models (i.e. conspecifics) inhabiting the same geographic area where they set their breeding territories, local similarities in song structure can arise (i.e. dialects). This learning can occur after dispersal with birds learning or retaining the dialects sang in the breeding grounds where they set (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib43">Nelson et al., 2001</xref>). Thus, in most species in which vocal learning occurs, the distribution of learned songs may reflect the social interactions among birds, not the genetic structure of the populations (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Kroodsma, 2004</xref>). A decoupling between patterns of cultural (songs) and genetic variation has also been reported for fin whales (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Hatch and Clark, 2004</xref>), further suggesting that song INIs may be socially learned in this species. Learning of novel rhythms (i.e. INIs; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib67">Vernes et al., 2021</xref>) can also be found in sperm whales (<italic>Physeter macrocephalus</italic>), which can match their clicks to the rhythm of a ship echosounder (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Backus and Schevill, 1996</xref>), and use codas (i.e. rhythmic patterns of clicks) that are unique to each vocal clan and are socially learned (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib58">Rendell and Whitehead, 2003</xref>). Fin whales may also be able to learn songs from other populations that not only differ in their INIs but also in their note composition (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Helble et al., 2020</xref>).</p><p>After the song transition from 1999 to 2005, we found a gradual increase in song INIs along with a decrease in peak frequencies of the 20 Hz and HF notes. These findings are in line with the gradual trends of decreasing frequencies (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Best et al., 2022</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">Leroy et al., 2018b</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib70">Weirathmueller et al., 2017</xref>) and increasing INIs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Best et al., 2022</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib41">Morano et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib62">Širović et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib70">Weirathmueller et al., 2017</xref>) described for fin whale songs in other ocean basins and in the Mediterranean Sea. Contrarily to the rapid changes in INIs, a global-scale process of cultural transmission cannot explain these directional changes. First, changes in INIs and frequencies occur at different rates in different oceans and there is no convergence in song acoustic characteristics across populations (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Leroy et al., 2018a</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib62">Širović et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib70">Weirathmueller et al., 2017</xref>). Second, a similar pattern of decreasing frequencies and increasing INIs has been described for blue whale (<italic>B. musculus</italic>) songs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Jolliffe et al., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">Malige et al., 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">McDonald et al., 2009</xref>), and decreasing frequencies have been reported for bowhead whales (<italic>Balaena mysticetus</italic>) calls (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib64">Thode et al., 2017</xref>). Such gradual song changes in multiple species and different ocean basins suggest an adaptation to a common selective pressure, which does not mean that within-region conformity in song characteristics does not result from cultural transmission. Mathematical modelling of the linear decrease in blue whale song frequencies suggest a simultaneous effect from two selection processes: conformity and sexual selection (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">Malige et al., 2022</xref>). Conformity would occur because individuals would be more likely to share variants of a cultural trait with nearby individuals than with more distant ones. This could be caused either by a conformist bias, which occurs when individuals select common variants from those available more often than would be expected by chance, or by more simple processes, such as only learning from nearby individuals (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib42">Morgan and Laland, 2012</xref>). Sexual selection would drive males to sing lower frequency songs than other whales, presumably because females prefer bigger males that are able to sing lower pitch songs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">Malige et al., 2022</xref>). Increased blue whale body size in a post-whaling recovery scenario has also been proposed as a potential explanation for this species’ song changes; yet blue whale body size distributions should have returned to near pre-whaling values by now and song frequencies continue to decrease (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">McDonald et al., 2009</xref>). Also, it is very unlikely that changes in whale body size evolved in such a straight line at this timescale (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">Malige et al., 2022</xref>). Fin whale songs may evolve in a similar way as blue whale songs do, but so far, none of the proposed hypotheses can convincingly explain the slow frequency song changes in these species (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">McDonald et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib64">Thode et al., 2017</xref>). Large-scale and long-term datasets would help understanding if fin whale song INIs and frequencies are constantly evolving or started changing recently in response to a new driver.</p><p>The rapid and gradual evolution of fin whale song parameters found in this, and other studies (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Hatch and Clark, 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib62">Širović et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib70">Weirathmueller et al., 2017</xref>), resemble the patterns of song evolution of some bird species and humpback whales. Evidence from songbirds suggest that these different trajectories in song evolution (rapid versus gradual) occur within certain boundaries because learned songs are subject to a combination of strong stabilizing selection and underlying genetic variation that prevent incremental change for long periods of time (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib40">McEntee et al., 2021</xref>). In humpback whales, song complexity increases as songs evolve gradually over time, but decreases when revolutions occur (i.e. periods of rapid song changes), suggesting that learning capacities in this species are limited (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Allen et al., 2018</xref>). After the rapid shift in fin whale song INIs, from 19s to 12s, a gradual reset towards the 19s-INIs seems to be occurring in all sampled areas, except from the Barents Sea. In the northwest Atlantic Ocean, rapid shifts in fin whale song INIs occurred between 15 s and 9 s (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Delarue et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib41">Morano et al., 2012</xref>). Perhaps, like in birdsongs and humpback whales, changes in fin whale song INIs are also limited by learning constrains and genetic predispositions. Our results show that fin whale song INIs from the Barents Sea region differ from the rest of the sampled area. Yet, satellite tracking data from 2015 to 2019 showed that some fin whales summering in Svalbard (Barents Sea) migrate to the SW Portugal region in fall and winter (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">Lydersen et al., 2020</xref>), so some degree of mixing between males from these two acoustic populations occur. Also, a recent study from Svalbard revealed that fin whale song INIs differed between singing seasons, which suggests that either fin whales from that area switch between INIs or different populations use the area sequentially (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib49">Papale et al., 2023</xref>). Investigating the changing patterns of fin whale song INIs in these two regions (Barents seas and SW Portugal) may shed some light on the learning mechanisms of song INIs and the limitations of its variability.</p><p>Compared to INIs, fin whale song frequencies of the 20 Hz and HF notes do not vary abruptly but only gradually. Fundamental frequencies of this species’ songs seem constrained by the optimisation of long-range communication in pelagic environments (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Clark and Garland, 2022</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib50">Payne and Webb, 1971</xref>). This song frequency limitation may be an adaptation first, to a dispersed and open water distribution of this species during the breeding season (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Edwards et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib44">Nieukirk et al., 2004</xref>) and second, to match a particular frequency band with low levels of noise in deep waters (i.e. a quiet window in frequency) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Clark and Garland, 2022</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Curtis et al., 1999</xref>). Comparatively, humpback and right whales (<italic>Eubalaena</italic> spp.) aggregate in coastal breeding grounds (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Clapham, 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Kenney, 2009</xref>) and use higher frequency songs and calls that transmit better in shallow environments (quiet window: 100–400 Hz) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Clark and Ellison, 2004</xref>) and do not need to reach distant conspecifics (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Clark, 1982</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Clark and Garland, 2022</xref>). Therefore, the acoustic environment during the mating season and the species’ breeding behaviour could constrain variation in song frequencies to keep them within the quiet window. In addition, the animals’ physiology can constrain song frequency variation. In birds, the ability to produce low-frequency songs is linked to body size (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib60">Ryan and Brenowitz, 1985</xref>). If fin whale song frequencies continue to decrease, it can potentially reach the physiological limits of sound production. These limits in song variation can compromise song function and ultimately male fitness when the acoustic habitat in which these songs evolved is changing too rapidly to adapt. For example, the vocal adaptation ability of birds in urban environments (e.g. increasing song frequencies) affect the detection by receivers. If birds are not able to avoid the masking of their songs by noise, this may difficult the establishment and defence of a territory that can ultimately affect their fitness (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Habib et al., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Luther and Derryberry, 2012</xref>). Similarly, the constraints in fin whale song frequency may limit adaptation to an increasingly noisy environment. Shipping noise, the major source of ocean noise, overlaps in frequency with fin whale songs and can cause a reduction of the communication space (CS) in this species (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Clark et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Erbe et al., 2019</xref>). Models estimate a reduction of CS by vessel noise of up to 80% for fin whales (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Cholewiak et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Clark et al., 2009</xref>). We ignore if fin whales use any anti-masking release mechanism when exposed to vessel noise (e.g. changing song frequencies), but if they do not, such reduction of CS could certainly disrupt communication and hinder the search of mates for reproduction, which ultimately would affect fin whale fitness.</p><p>Results from this and other studies suggest that male fin whales are in acoustic contact over vast areas and adjust their song properties to match those of conspecifics (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Leroy et al., 2018a</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib47">Oleson et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib70">Weirathmueller et al., 2017</xref>). These acoustic communities culturally evolve more quickly and efficiently than genetic communities (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Hatch and Clark, 2004</xref>) and should be considered in conservation strategies when delimiting stocks or populations. The acoustic habitat in which these songs evolved has shaped the acoustic properties and limits of variation of these signals. Understanding the cultural evolution of fin whale songs can inform us about the species’ ability to adapt to the actual scenario of rapidly changing ocean soundscapes due to anthropogenic activities. These results also have implications for cue counting approaches, which use cue rates (e.g. notes per unit time) to convert density of sounds to density of animals (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">Marques et al., 2013</xref>). The temporal and spatial changes in fin whale song INIs found here affect cue rates and need to be considered to avoid bias in estimating densities using passive acoustic monitoring in this species. The unique large spatial scale over which fin whales communicate, although technologically challenging for researchers, opens interesting perspectives in the processes of animal acoustic communication.</p></sec><sec id="s4" sec-type="materials|methods"><title>Materials and methods</title><sec id="s4-1"><title>Sampling locations</title><p>Acoustic data were compiled from 15 locations in the central and northeast Atlantic Ocean, grouped into seven regions: SE Greenland, SE Iceland, Celtic Sea (North and South Porcupine), Oceanic Northeast Atlantic (ONA) (NE, NW, CE, CW, Azores, SE and SW), SW Portugal, Canary Islands and Barents Sea (Svalbard and Vesterålen; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5A</xref>).</p><fig-group><fig id="fig5" position="float"><label>Figure 5.</label><caption><title>Sampling locations and fin whale song spectrogram.</title><p>(<bold>A</bold>) Locations (stars) of acoustic recordings grouped in regions (colours in stars): SE Greenland (black), SE Iceland (turquoise), Celtic Sea (NP: North Porcupine and SP: South Porcupine; green), Oceanic Northeast Atlantic (NW, NE, CW, CE, Azores, SW and SE; blue), SW Portugal (red), Canary Islands (yellow) and Barents Sea (SV: Svalbard and VE: Vesterålen<italic>;</italic> purple).

In all datasets, spectrograms of days with fin whale detections were manually analysed using Adobe Audition 3.0 software (Adobe Systems Incorporated, CA, USA) to select periods with good quality notes, based on: (a) clearly distinguishable song notes in the spectrogram (Signal to noise ratio - SNR &gt;5 dB), (b) absence of masking from noise, (c) presence of a single singer and, (d) occurrence of at least 10 notes organized in a series. The last criterion could not be applied for recordings with small duty cycles (SW Portugal 2015–2016, Azores 2008–2011 and the Celtic Sea) (<xref ref-type="table" rid="table1">Table 1</xref>); nevertheless, regularly spaced notes could still be identified as part of songs and were used for these sites.

Recordings from the Canary Islands, SW Portugal (2007–2008), and ONA regions, except for the Azores, were excluded from the analysis of the HF note, because sampling rates were too low to enable detection of the HF note frequency (~130 Hz) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Hatch and Clark, 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="table" rid="table1">Table 1</xref>).</p></sec><sec id="s4-5"><title>Measurement of song parameters: INIs and peak frequencies</title><p>Selected days with good quality notes (see ‘Song selection criteria’ section) were fed into a band-limited energy detector in Raven Pro 1.5 software (Cornell Lab of Ornithology, Ithaca, NY, USA) that automatically selected all 20 Hz and HF notes in the spectrogram. All selections were checked manually by the same analyst to ensure that notes were well imbedded in the selection square. Spectrogram characteristics were adjusted to visualise all data with the same frequency and time resolution (1.25 Hz and 0.4 s). For each selected note, the software measured Begin and End time, Time of the 5% cumulative energy (Time 5%), Peak frequency and Inband Power (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="supp1">Supplementary file 1c</xref>). INIs were calculated by subtracting the time (Time 5%) difference between consecutive 20 Hz notes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib62">Širović et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib69">Watkins et al., 1987</xref>; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5B</xref>). This measurement calculates the point in time dividing the selection into two-time intervals containing 5% and 95% of the energy. Peak frequencies were measured for 20 Hz and HF notes and represent the value at which the maximum energy in the signal occurs. It is considered a robust measurement since it is based on the energy within the selection and not the time and frequency boundaries of the selection (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Charif et al., 2010</xref>). Only one sequence of notes or song fragment (hereafter referred as song) was analysed per day in each location. If multiple songs were found in one day, the one with the highest SNR was selected. For each song, we calculated the mean and standard deviation of INIs and of peak frequencies of the 20 Hz and HF notes.</p></sec><sec id="s4-6"><title>Analysis of fin whale song INIs and note frequencies</title><p>Temporal patterns in song INIs were investigated by plotting mean song INIs and standard deviations of all regions into chronological order. Due to the identification of two song INIs during the first period of data (1999–2005), belonging to the ONA region, we also calculated the percentage of each song INI per singing season in this dataset. Specifically, the SE location of the ONA region, which had the longest time series (1999–2005), was used to investigate changes in song INI percentages over this period. The other locations of the ONA region had data only for the singing season of 2002/2003 and were used to investigate the spatial patterns in song INIs across six locations (NE, NW, CE, CW, SE and SW) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5A</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5s1">Figure 5—figure supplement 1</xref>).</p><p>After this first period, data from all regions were plotted in chronological order to investigate how song parameters varied over time. A linear regression model was fit to each response variable (INIs and peak frequencies of the 20 Hz and HF notes) using a Gaussian distribution and year as the explanatory variable.

Description of fin whale song measurements made with Raven Pro 1.4 software (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Charif et al., 2010</xref>). (d) The effect of recording equipment on fin whale song parameters When comparing data from multiple sensors an obvious question is whether the results might be dependent on the specific sensors considered. To investigate the influence of the acoustic recorder type, OBS or ARs, on the song parameters, we analysed the same song fragment, consisting of 209 notes, recorded by the hydrophone channel of an OBS and an AR, specifically an Ecological Acoustic Recorder (EAR) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Lammers et al., 2008</xref>). The two instruments were deployed at ~6 km from each other in the Azores region in spring of 2019. Measurements of INIs and 20 Hz peak frequencies of songs recorded by each instrument were compared using a non-parametric paired samples Wilcoxon Test. Differences in HF note peak frequencies could not be tested because of limitations in the sampling rate of the OBS. Results showed that median INIs measured from OBS (16.52) and EARs (16.42) were not significantly different (<italic>P</italic>-value = 0.47) but median peak frequencies of the 20 Hz note (median OBS = 23.4; EARs = 21.1) were (<italic>P</italic>-value &lt;0.001). Thus, the use of different recorders did not affect INI measurements but influenced measurements of 20 Hz peak frequencies. The effect of the distance to the source in the analysed fin whale song parameters is included in this study, given that these two recorders were positioned at different distances to the singer. Peak frequencies of the 20 Hz note showed a great variability between equipment types (Fig. S3), which hindered the identification of soft trends (i.e., low changing rate). For this reason, only data from the EARs, the longest dataset (2008 – 2020), were used to study temporal variations of the peak frequencies of the 20 Hz note.

Your article has been reviewed by 3 peer reviewers, one of whom is a member of our Board of Reviewing Editors, and the evaluation has been overseen by Christian Rutz as the Senior Editor. The following individuals involved in review of your submission have agreed to reveal their identity: Christopher W Clark (Reviewer #1).</p><p>Overall, our decision is that the manuscript is not suitable for publication in its current form, but we invite you to revise it following the feedback given below. The reviewers have discussed their reviews with one another, and the Reviewing Editor has drafted this to help you prepare a revised submission. The revisions we ask for are substantial, but hope you agree that they will improve the manuscript, and I encourage you to take them on board – failing to do so to the satisfaction of the reviewing team may lead to rejection.</p><p>Essential revisions:</p><p>1. Having looked at the data and the analysis, we are not convinced the main story here is about conformity. Isn't the picture more about the fact that there are continual gradual changes which raises the question as to how changes could keep going in the same direction once they start to hit physiological limits, and now, we have a possible answer – periodically they reset? This is a really useful piece of understanding, but it would be better if the paper centred on this as a principal question – the gradual changes were already known about in blues and to some degree in fins (e.g. Rankin /Stafford/Castellote Oleson etc. etc.), but now we see how some song features of a male fin whale singer population can remain within certain bounds and not infinitely (and impossibly) reduce or change song characteristics. Please revise in the light of these arguments.</p><p>2. We are not convinced the authors are correct in describing this change in rate as a change of song type. No definition of 'type' in fin whale song is given. Even though fin whale calls are evidently a male mating ground display, little is known about its function. Compared to humpback whales with their impressive repertoire of vocalizations, repeating themselves on the breeding grounds after some tens of minutes and therefore qualifying as a very slow 'song' similar to bird song, fin whale songs in the North Atlantic are composed from three simple note types, and they are only changing pitch and timing – it is not really a new type of song. Please revise in the light of these arguments.</p><p>3. The abstract states: &quot;We also revealed gradual changes in INIs and note frequencies over more than a decade with all males adopting both rapid and gradual changes.&quot; The data are such that the authors could not determine if an individual singer adopted both rapid and gradual changes. A singer only contributed a data point to the overall collection of INI and frequency values. As such, if individual males could not be shown to actually adopt changes in INIs and note frequencies over more than a decade, how could all males be shown to do this? Please reflect on the nature of your data and how it relates to changes within and between individuals in the light of these arguments.</p><p>4. Please undertake a major rewrite of the introduction – currently it lacks depth and breadth – improving one of these should be sufficient – for depth, for example, what are the various motivations for understanding song variation in fin whales and in other taxa? L89-91 is not sufficient. Also, a discussion of genetic population structure in fin whales should be included – spatially this study relies on ICES ecoregions but the relevance of these for fin whales is unclear. The inclusion and treatment of avian song learning studies is simplistic and not accurate in places. Given the immense amount of multi-decadal, multi-species, impactful research on captive and free-ranging birds, the reduction of the level of understanding of avian song acquisition to &quot;learning to vocalize through imitation&quot; is both incorrect and unacceptable. At best, a few selected references to the most appropriate discoveries and synthesis should be cited, for example, Marler and Slabbekoorn, Nature's Music: The Science of Birdsong. Consider also Mennill's work on cultural transmission and consider also Otter et al. Curr Bio 2020.</p><p>5. It took reviewers some time reading this manuscript to figure out that the analyses were focussed on two different time periods – the ONA data showing the apparent transition from the 19s INI to the 12s INI in the early 2000s and then the broader scale data showing more gradual trends apparently paralleled across the study area. We think the presentation could go a lot further to making these 2 different analyses more clearly distinguished – one local showing abrupt change in one region and then one on a larger scale showing the gradual change over time.</p><p>6. The points about conformity on L49 could be better supported by citations – in fact, this is not a well-known definition of conformity – the cultural evolution literature is replete with them – look to papers by e.g. Morgan, Whiten, Laland – and the learning of nearby songs over distant ones can be explained simply by the physics of transmission loss under the reasonable assumption that the clearer you hear a song the more likely you are to learn it. It still leads to interesting patterns of variation and does not argue against social learning still underlying song variation, but we are less convinced by this conformity argument.</p><p>7. In places it sounds like the authors are writing from a slightly defensive posture as if they feel bad somehow that fin whale songs are less 'complex' than, say, humpbacks. We encourage the authors to be specific about what is meant by complexity (e.g. number of different song unit types, or number of phrase types in a song), reflect on whether the relationship between complexity and interpretability is as straightforward as they suggest, and finally reflect on why they apparently buy into the idea that 'complexity=interesting' assumption that they feel the need to defend their study against, and revise accordingly.</p><p>8. L75 &quot;studies on fin whale song changes have been merely descriptive&quot;</p><p>- how is this study not also descriptive? Reviewers disliked the descriptor 'merely' for descriptive studies – try posing a hypothesis without leaning on some form of description of your study system! This might be better focussed on some strengths of this study like temporal and spatial coverage.</p><p>9. L79-80 the phrase 'unknown mechanisms of vocal behaviour' is a bit mysterious please be more explicit in your meaning here.</p><p>10. L77 this para was vague on the motivations of the study – 'report the dynamics' is a kind of place-holder from which it is hard to predict the actual analyses that were run. Why did you suspect there might be such dynamics? What aspects did you think would be subject to geographic and temporal variation, and why?</p><p>11. The lack of proper inclusion and interpretation of previous studies documenting seasonal and multi-annual changes in fin whale INI needs to be addressed (e.g., Delarue et al. 2009, Morano et al. 2012). For example, Morano et al. 2012 shows seasonal INI variations and fluctuation between 10s and 16s.</p><p>12. L95 – Figure 1A shows a map, not changes in frequency?</p><p>13. L95 – Two 'songs' are described here as if the reader should know what they are but they haven't been defined yet. Perhaps explain here what you mean by the '19s-INI' song and the rules you used to differentiate between the songs. Reviewers would ask you to start with a strictly factual description of the results before adding interpretations such as 'we named these two different INI periods as two different song types'. We are not sure that these are different songs – there are definitely different rhythms, but actually the units and their order are exactly the same. So they might be better described as distinct 'tempos' or 'rhythms' rather than completely different songs?</p><p>14. L97 why is only the SE ONA region presented in such detail – what happens at the other recorders concurrently? And why is only 2002/2003 presented for the entire ONA region?</p><p>15. L99-100 – define a 'hybrid song' and how they were identified – would also be interesting to know how the different INIs were distributed over the sequence – first one then the other, or more mixed?</p><p>16. The text mentions acquisition duty-cycle with a reference to Table S1, but that table does not list the start date-time and end date-time of the sampling. If one goes to Figure S1 showing a color-coded listing of recording effort, the time resolution is in months, and data in this chart is not linked to sample rate or duty-cycle. A reader must be given all the necessary information by which to assess data quality, validity of analysis results and reliability of interpretation.</p><p>17. Along similar lines: L300-301 – how was the 'lowest SNR' channel selected – from measurements, estimations, sampling? How was SNR measured? Important details such as duty cycle and sampling rate are in a supplementary table, but I think they are important enough to earn their place in the main text.</p><p>18. L177 this sentence confused the reviewers – it seems to contradict itself?</p><p>19. L241-242 – isn't the adoption of a new song actually evidence <italic>against</italic> conformity? Since in a conformist scenario, the new song has to get common enough to be the majority option?</p><p>20. L259-260 – We urge the authors to think more critically about the suggestion that humpback song could function as a sonar (for example, considering the long-standing arguments of Au and Cato against this notion) but it is worth noting that if any baleen whale song were to function in some kind of sonar way then they would be better adapted in terms of their regular structure – however, the frequencies being so low really do make it an unlikely function.</p><p>21. Text concludes that there was a &quot;complete turnover&quot; of INI. This is a rather strong conclusion given the spatial and temporal sparseness of the data. Is this the right form of words to describe the observations?</p><p>22. The time-warping used in Figure 2A, Figure 3A, B and C is a bit misleading. Excluding time gaps in available data distorts the time series and could obscure an actual structure (tendency.) We suggest remaking Figure 2A such that the time scale is uniformly linear, not dilated as in a form of dynamic time warping. As presented, it is difficult to interpret. For example, what does the 2001-2002 period include, October 2001 through March 2002? But it could be that all these samples are from Nov 2001 through Jan 2002. Maybe monthly tic marks would help? How about horizontal lines at each of the integer INI values? This might help the reader see slight increases in INI slope over time? Figure S1 is an incomplete synthesis of the data set. It would be valuable to have more and better represented details. We suggest rearranging this figure so that the time months are based on the singing season, not the human calendar. This would have the left-to-right 6six month period go from Oct through March, thereby representing the behavior from the species' behavioral biology perspective rather than a human calendar. This simplifies the representation of when and where each of the possible 20 singing seasons is sampled. It would also be beneficial to clearly show how much each of the sites contributed to the INI and frequency samples.</p><p>23. L309-311 – given that two different methodologies were used (manual and LFDCS), was there any test of the two systems on the same recordings to check they are yield comparable results?</p><p>24. L315 specify how long a 'long series' was.</p><p>25. The text and figures are not always consistent. For example, the text refers to the E region as the &quot;Bay of Biscay and Iberian Coast&quot;, when it contained only a single sensor deployed off the southwest of the Iberian Peninsula. This contrast between the realities of where and when acoustic samples were collected and how the aggregated results are spatially or temporally interpreted or labelled persists throughout the manuscript.</p><p>26. Supplementary material needs a table listing the details of the acoustic data recording effort (e.g., from date-time, to date-time) and the acoustic analysis effort (e.g., total recording hours per deployment, for each deployment at each site list the proportion of the total hours relative to the grand total of recording hours, INI-song dates, song time of day start, duration, number of notes.) For example in Figure S1, in January of 2003 for the SE site in the Oceanic Northeast Atlantic region, a song from each of four different days was analyzed yielding a total of 556 INI values for that month. Data from this SE site is the dominant source of recordings in this study. Section 1 in the Supplemental Material is headed in the right direction of addressing sampling aliasing influences on outcome, and this type of effort needs to be included given the large differences in sampling effort/site.</p><p>27. We could not find any details on analysis parameters except for the spectrogram figure in Figure 1, where it gives 1024-point FFT, Hann window, 50% overlap. There was no mention of time and frequency resolutions. E.g., if using 1024-point FFT, Hann window, 50% overlap, then the time resolution is 0.26 s and frequency is 1.95 Hz. These resolutions determine the ability to measure and track changes in INI and note peak frequencies. We may have missed seeing a listing of the measurements collected using Raven, but if they weren't there, then they should be included.</p><p>28. L335-337 – the measurement of INIs is insufficiently explained – the figure implies this was a separate measurement from the Raven selection boxes, yet there are robust measurement methods in Raven for measuring onsets based on energy content over time (e.g the 5% cumulative energy threshold).</p><p>29. L350 song types were known prior to this study? Otherwise, this is a result in the wrong place…</p><p>30. L360 – 'except for the Barent's Sea which showed different INIs' – this is a little problematic since it implies you excluded data not for any a-priori reason but because it didn't fit with your preferred model – it is obvious why such a process would not be conducive to rigour. If there is reason to believe the whales from that region belong to an entirely different population and thereby establish an a-priori reason for their exclusion then that should be presented and justified, but excluding data from analyses after results are known isn't a robust way to go about things.</p><p>31. The degree to which this is evidence of vocal learning may be a bit overplayed. Definitely there is change, but it is tricky to compare this to e.g. experimental demonstrations. For example, age-related changes in a changing post-whaling demographic scenario should at least be considered?</p><p>32. The document contains various grammatical and punctuation errors, and there are several errors in the reference section. Please proof-read the manuscript thoroughly.</p><p><italic>Reviewer #1 (Recommendations for the authors):</italic></p><p>This is a valuable piece of research and represents a tremendous amount of work. Overall, it is well written and well organized. The extent of these comments reflects the extent of my keen interest in the topic as well wanting to strengthen the manuscript's scientific integrity. With some further effort, it is certainly worthy of publication somewhere, but I have not been asked to render a decision as to where it might best be published.</p><p>These following comments are not exhaustive. They are representative. The more I continued to read, reread, and focus on certain aspects of this very interesting and well written paper, the more worried I became about of the influences on sampling aliases on the results and the interpretations of those results. For example, the text mentions acquisition duty-cycle with a reference to Table S1, but that table does not list the start date-time and end date-time of the sampling. If one goes to Figure S1 showing a color-coded listing of recording effort, the time resolution is in months, and data in this chart is not linked to sample rate or duty-cycle. A reader must be given all the necessary information by which to assess data quality, validity of analysis results and reliability of interpretation.</p><p>The inclusion and treatment of avian song learning studies is remarkably simplistic and certainly not scholarly accurate.

This is a rather strong conclusion given the spatial and temporal sparseness of the data. Is this the right form of words to describe the observations?</p><p>I've already made comments about the sampling bias resulting from the high variability in sampling dates and durations. I found time-warping used in Figure 2A, Figure 3A, B and C inappropriately misleading. Excluding time gaps in available data distorts the time series and could obscure an actual structure (tendency.) I don't doubt that the statistical evaluations in the Supplemental materials are appropriate, but Figure S1 is an incomplete synthesis of the data set. It would be valuable to have more and better represented details. I suggest rearranging this figure so that the time months are based on the singing season, not the human calendar. This would have the left-to-right six month period go from Oct through March, thereby representing the behavior from the species' behavioral biology perspective rather than a human calendar. This simplifies the representation of when and where each of the possible 20 singing season is sampled. It would also be beneficial to clearly show how much each of the sites contributed to the INI and frequency samples.</p><p>There is a tendency to slightly, and likely inadvertently, misstate or overstate a result. For example, in the Abstract: &quot;We also revealed gradual changes in INIs and note frequencies over more than a decade with all males adopting both rapid and gradual changes.&quot; The data are such that the authors could not determine if an individual singer adopted both rapid and gradual changes. A singer only contributed a data point to the overall collection of INI and frequency values. As such, if individual males could not be shown to actually adopt changes in INIs and note frequencies over more than a decade, how could all males be shown to do this? The unit of analysis needs to be very clearly stated and adhered to throughout the manuscript. The observation of rapid and gradual changes is derived by aggregating INI results from all singers (N = sum of all monthly song samples?) and is not based on the behavior of single individual singers.</p><p>The text and figures are not always consistent. For example, the text refers to the E region as the &quot;Bay of Biscay and Iberian Coast&quot;, when it contained only a single sensor deployed off the southwest of the Iberian Peninsula. This contrast between the realities of where and when acoustic samples were collected and how the aggregated results are spatially or temporally interpreted or labelled persists throughout the manuscript. Why are ICES ecoregions needed or useful?</p><p>Suggest remaking Figure 2A such that the time scale is uniformly linear, not dilated as in a form of dynamic time warping.

In Supplemental material is headed in the right direction of addressing sampling aliasing influences on outcome, and this type of effort needs to be included given the large differences in sampling effort/site.</p><p>I could not find any details on analysis parameters except for the spectrogram figure in Figure 1, where it gives 1024-point FFT, Hann window, 50% overlap. There was no mention of time and frequency resolutions. E.g., if using 1024-point FFT, Hann window, 50% overlap, then the time resolution is 0.26 s and frequency is 1.95 Hz. These resolutions determine the ability to measure and track changes in INI and note peak frequencies. I must have missed seeing a listing of the measurements collected using Raven, but if they weren't there, then they should be included.</p><p>In Figure 1B, it appears that the time of occurrence of a 20-Hz note is taken around the time at which the analyst visually determined the &quot;begin time&quot; of the note. This is not a reliable means of determining the time of occurrence of an acoustic event. The same issue regarding frequency resolution applies (see Fristrup and Watkins 1993, and Raven Pro User's Manual). I don't think this necessarily will make a huge difference in the basic message in the manuscript, but it does impact the resolution and uncertainty in the two major measurements in this manuscript.</p><p>The document contains various grammatical and punctuation errors, and there are several errors in the reference section. If I've misinterpreted the text, figures, or supplemental materials, these are certainly unintentional, and I extend my apologies. The paper was very interesting, and I have tried my best to understand it from a variety of perspectives, while being forthright about what I feel must be corrected.</p><p><italic>Reviewer #2 (Recommendations for the authors):</italic></p><p>It took me some time reading this manuscript to figure out that the analyses were focussed on two different time periods – the ONA data showing the apparent transition from the 19s INI to the 12s INI in the early 2000s and then the broader scale data showing more gradual trends apparently paralleled across the study area. I think the presentation could go a lot further to making these 2 different analyses more clearly distinguished – one local showing abrupt change in one region and then one on a larger scale showing the gradual change over time.</p><p>Having looked at the data and the analysis I am not convinced the main story here is about conformity. Isn't the picture more about the fact that there are continual gradual changes which initially raised the query as how this could keep going and now we have an answer – periodically they reset. This is a really useful piece of understanding but it would be better in my view if the paper centred this as a principal question – the gradual changes were already known about in blues and to some degree in fins (e.g. Rankin/Castellote) but now we see how the population can stay within certain bounds and not infinitely (and impossibly) reduce or change song characters. Why this happens – gradual change with periodic 'resets' – is similar but not precisely parallel to humpbacks – mainly because I don't think these are different 'songs' – the units are the same, the structure is the same, just some quantitative aspects of the song change. This doesn't diminish the importance for me, but just is more accurate – I think it would be a mistake to too easily reach for the humpback comparison – the differences are fascinating and worthy of further study – why such simple songs compared to the humpback acoustic peacock tail?? Is it related to functionality, or to different population structure and breeding patterns? And why the changes? I agree such directional changes make conformity a plausible process, and this is especially the case if whales changed their individual songs at the 2000 'reset' – fascinating to reflect on how that might be instigated or triggered, but also important to consider whether range shifts/population movements and/or demographic changes might mean it's actually different individuals or ontogenetic changes.</p><p>Introduction:</p><p>In general the introduction lacks depth and breadth – improving one of these should be sufficient – for depth, for example, what are the various motivations for understanding song variation in fin whales and in other taxa – L89-91 is not sufficient.

Having looked at the data and the analysis, we are not convinced the main story here is about conformity. Isn't the picture more about the fact that there are continual gradual changes which raises the question as to how changes could keep going in the same direction once they start to hit physiological limits, and now, we have a possible answer – periodically they reset? This is a really useful piece of understanding, but it would be better if the paper centred on this as a principal question – the gradual changes were already known about in blues and to some degree in fins (e.g. Rankin /Stafford/Castellote Oleson etc. etc.), but now we see how some song features of a male fin whale singer population can remain within certain bounds and not infinitely (and impossibly) reduce or change song characteristics. Please revise in the light of these arguments.</p></disp-quote><p>We have reviewed the manuscript according to the reviewers’ perspective that conformity is not the main story that can better reflect our data and analysis. First, we have changed the title from “Fin whale singalong: evidence of song conformity” to “Fin whale song evolution in the North Atlantic”. Then, we have made major changes in the introduction and discussion so that the manuscript does not focus on conformity but on cultural transmission, song evolution and the limits of song variation. We believe that fin whales show enough evidence of song cultural transmission (from this and other studies), and this is why we decided to maintain this topic in the introduction and discussion.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>2. We are not convinced the authors are correct in describing this change in rate as a change of song type. No definition of 'type' in fin whale song is given. Even though fin whale calls are evidently a male mating ground display, little is known about its function. Compared to humpback whales with their impressive repertoire of vocalizations, repeating themselves on the breeding grounds after some tens of minutes and therefore qualifying as a very slow 'song' similar to bird song, fin whale songs in the North Atlantic are composed from three simple note types, and they are only changing pitch and timing – it is not really a new type of song. Please revise in the light of these arguments.</p></disp-quote><p>The reviewers raise an interesting point here and because we cannot prove that the different INI types here belong to different song types, we have replaced the term song type to song INI type. In the discussion, we hypothesise that these INI types may belong to different song types based on previous evidence that INIs are regionally distinct and could be considered different song types that differentiate populations.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>3. The abstract states: &quot;We also revealed gradual changes in INIs and note frequencies over more than a decade with all males adopting both rapid and gradual changes.&quot; The data are such that the authors could not determine if an individual singer adopted both rapid and gradual changes. A singer only contributed a data point to the overall collection of INI and frequency values. As such, if individual males could not be shown to actually adopt changes in INIs and note frequencies over more than a decade, how could all males be shown to do this? Please reflect on the nature of your data and how it relates to changes within and between individuals in the light of these arguments.</p></disp-quote><p>We acknowledge this sentence was not accurate or did not reflect the nature of our data. We have now removed the terms “all males” by just simply “sampled fin whale songs”, not specifying if all individuals or not adopt song changes.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>4. Please undertake a major rewrite of the introduction – currently it lacks depth and breadth – improving one of these should be sufficient – for depth, for example, what are the various motivations for understanding song variation in fin whales and in other taxa? L89-91 is not sufficient. Also, a discussion of genetic population structure in fin whales should be included – spatially this study relies on ICES ecoregions but the relevance of these for fin whales is unclear. The inclusion and treatment of avian song learning studies is simplistic and not accurate in places. Given the immense amount of multi-decadal, multi-species, impactful research on captive and free-ranging birds, the reduction of the level of understanding of avian song acquisition to &quot;learning to vocalize through imitation&quot; is both incorrect and unacceptable. At best, a few selected references to the most appropriate discoveries and synthesis should be cited, for example, Marler and Slabbekoorn, Nature's Music: The Science of Birdsong. Consider also Mennill's work on cultural transmission and consider also Otter et al. Curr Bio 2020.</p></disp-quote><p>We have made a major rewrite of the introduction, so conformity is not the principal topic of our manuscript. We now focus on song evolution mechanisms, cultural transmission and the limits of song variation. To do so, we have reviewed a few examples of song evolution in birds, because it is the best studied taxa on the topic, and then we mentioned a few aspects of humpback whale song evolution to go straight to fin whales from there. We have further extended the fin whale paragraph on fin whale songs and added a genetic review from the North Atlantic and how this relates to the acoustic properties of songs in this species. This leads to the motivations of investigating song variations in animals and how can we improve this knowledge. Regarding the area divisions based on the ICES ecoregions, we have adopted our own divisions based on practicality. For example, we have kept the ONA region in the Mid-North Atlantic Ocean facilitate the explanation of song changes in the first sampled period. In the discussion we have added more accurate information on birds’ vocal learning, following the reviewers’ recommendations.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>5.

We have changed the titles of the Results section and figures to be clearer and more direct in terms of process, region and sampling period analysed. We have now separated the rapid and gradual changes in 2 sections: 1. Transition in song INIs in the Oceanic Northeast Atlantic region and 2. Gradual changes in song INIs and notes frequencies. Within the first section on rapid song changes (1999 – 2005) we have split the old version Figure 2 into two figures, now Figure 1 only referring to the temporal variation in the SE location; and Figure 2. Referring to the spatial pattern of song INIs in the ONA region (2002/2003). We have also clearly specified these different analyses in the methods, in the section now titled “Temporal and spatial analysis of fin whale song INIs.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>6.

The text mentions acquisition duty-cycle with a reference to Table S1, but that table does not list the start date-time and end date-time of the sampling. If one goes to Figure S1 showing a color-coded listing of recording effort, the time resolution is in months, and data in this chart is not linked to sample rate or duty-cycle.

The time-warping used in Figure 2A, Figure 3A, B and C is a bit misleading. Excluding time gaps in available data distorts the time series and could obscure an actual structure (tendency.) We suggest remaking Figure 2A such that the time scale is uniformly linear, not dilated as in a form of dynamic time warping. As presented, it is difficult to interpret. For example, what does the 2001-2002 period include, October 2001 through March 2002? But it could be that all these samples are from Nov 2001 through Jan 2002. Maybe monthly tic marks would help? How about horizontal lines at each of the integer INI values? This might help the reader see slight increases in INI slope over time? Figure S1 is an incomplete synthesis of the data set. It would be valuable to have more and better represented details. We suggest rearranging this figure so that the time months are based on the singing season, not the human calendar. This would have the left-to-right 6six month period go from Oct through March, thereby representing the behavior from the species' behavioral biology perspective rather than a human calendar. This simplifies the representation of when and where each of the possible 20 singing seasons is sampled. It would also be beneficial to clearly show how much each of the sites contributed to the INI and frequency samples.</p></disp-quote><p>We completely agree with reviewers regarding the time scale in the x-axis of these figures. We have modified all figures displaying time in their x-axis scales (Figure 1C, Figures 3A, B and C, and Figure 3 —figure supplement 2) and they now have a uniform linear time scale with years in axis ticks and titles and horizontal lines at each INI value. Figure S1, now Figure 5 —figure supplement 1, has also been modified and now time is represented as singing seasons instead of the normal human calendar. Also, days and number of INIs and HF notes are displayed in two columns next to the chronogram. A new table (Table 1) has been added to the main text with information on contribution of each location to the total number of INIs and HF note peak frequencies measured.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>23.

The automatic method (LFCDS) had been used in some data of the Azores (2008-2012) for a previous study and we reused this data here.

For example in Figure S1, in January of 2003 for the SE site in the Oceanic Northeast Atlantic region, a song from each of four different days was analyzed yielding a total of 556 INI values for that month. Data from this SE site is the dominant source of recordings in this study. Section 1 in the Supplemental Material is headed in the right direction of addressing sampling aliasing influences on outcome, and this type of effort needs to be included given the large differences in sampling effort/site.</p></disp-quote><p>We have added a new table (Table 1) in the main text with information on sampling period, recording hours and contribution of each location to the total number of INIs and HF note peak frequencies measured. We have also added a new table in supplementary material (Supplementary file 1a) with information on date, times of first and last note, duration and number of INIs measured for each fin whale song analysed.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>27. We could not find any details on analysis parameters except for the spectrogram figure in Figure 1, where it gives 1024-point FFT, Hann window, 50% overlap. There was no mention of time and frequency resolutions. E.g., if using 1024-point FFT, Hann window, 50% overlap, then the time resolution is 0.26 s and frequency is 1.95 Hz. These resolutions determine the ability to measure and track changes in INI and note peak frequencies. We may have missed seeing a listing of the measurements collected using Raven, but if they weren't there, then they should be included.</p></disp-quote><p>The frequency and time resolution are now incorporated in the main text. In the methods section “Measurement of song parameters: inter-note intervals and peak frequencies” we have included in brackets, information on time and frequency resolution: 1.25 Hz frequency resolution and 0.4 sec.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>28. L335-337 – the measurement of INIs is insufficiently explained – the figure implies this was a separate measurement from the Raven selection boxes, yet there are robust measurement methods in Raven for measuring onsets based on energy content over time (e.g the 5% cumulative energy threshold).</p></disp-quote><p>In the previous manuscript version, we had measured INIs by calculating the time difference between two begin times of consecutive 20-Hz notes. As the reviewer points out, this was not a robust measurement as it highly depends on the selection box. For this reason, we have reanalysed the entire dataset with Raven to calculate INIs using the 5% cumulative energy threshold, as the reviewer suggests. This analysis has not changed our results. We have also included a description of all Raven measurements in a new table (Supplementary file 1c) placed in supplementary material.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>29. L350 song types were known prior to this study? Otherwise, this is a result in the wrong place…</p></disp-quote><p>We completely agree with the reviewer and have now renamed song types with INI types (please see response to comment 2).</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>30. L360 – 'except for the Barent's Sea which showed different INIs' – this is a little problematic since it implies you excluded data not for any a-priori reason but because it didn't fit with your preferred model – it is obvious why such a process would not be conducive to rigour. If there is reason to believe the whales from that region belong to an entirely different population and thereby establish an a-priori reason for their exclusion then that should be presented and justified, but excluding data from analyses after results are known isn't a robust way to go about things.</p></disp-quote><p>We agree with the reviewer and acknowledge this was not scientifically correct. In consequence, we have removed this sentence and fitted the linear model considering all regions sampled and recalculated the changing rate.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>31. The degree to which this is evidence of vocal learning may be a bit overplayed. Definitely there is change, but it is tricky to compare this to e.g. experimental demonstrations. For example, age-related changes in a changing post-whaling demographic scenario should at least be considered?</p></disp-quote><p>We lowered the tone when discussing vocal learning in fin whales, but we still believe there is enough evidence from previous studies that this species is able of vocal learning. We do not affirm that our study proves vocal learning in this species, but we discuss it considering all available evidence of this process (other studies). As the reviewer suggested, we have added a discussion on the age-related changes in a changing post-whaling demographic scenario as a potential driver of song changes in fin whales.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>32.
