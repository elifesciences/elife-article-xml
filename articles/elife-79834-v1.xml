Excessive accumulation of fat in the abdomen further increases T2D risk. Abdominal obesity is measured by calculating the ratio of waist-to-hip circumference adjusted for the body-mass index (WHRadjBMI), a trait with a significant genetic inheritance. Genetic loci associated with WHRadjBMI identified in genome-wide association studies are predicted to act through adipose tissues, but many of the exact molecular mechanisms underlying fat distribution and its consequences for T2D risk are poorly understood. Further, mechanisms that uncouple the genetic inheritance of abdominal obesity from T2D risk have not yet been described. Here we utilize multi-omic data to predict mechanisms of action at loci associated with discordant effects on abdominal obesity and T2D risk. We find six genetic signals in five loci associated with protection from T2D but also with increased abdominal obesity. We predict the tissues of action at these discordant loci and the likely effector Genes (eGenes) at three discordant loci, from which we predict significant involvement of adipose biology. We then evaluate the relationship between adipose gene expression of eGenes with adipogenesis, obesity, and diabetic physiological phenotypes. By integrating these analyses with prior literature, we propose models that resolve the discordant associations at two of the five loci. While experimental validation is required to validate predictions, these hypotheses provide potential mechanisms underlying T2D risk stratification within abdominal obesity.</p></abstract><kwd-group kwd-group-type="author-keywords"><kwd>type 2 diabetes</kwd><kwd>body fat distribution</kwd><kwd>metabolically healthy obesity</kwd><kwd>functional genomics</kwd><kwd>statistical genetics</kwd></kwd-group><kwd-group kwd-group-type="research-organism"><title>Research organism</title><kwd>Human</kwd></kwd-group><funding-group><award-group id="fund1"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000050</institution-id><institution>National Heart, Lung, and Blood Institute</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>2T32HL007284-46</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Aberra</surname><given-names>Yonathan Tamrat</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund2"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000062</institution-id><institution>National Institute of Diabetes and Digestive and Kidney Diseases</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>R01 DK118287</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Civelek</surname><given-names>Mete</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><funding-statement>The funders had no role in study design, data collection and interpretation, or the decision to submit the work for publication.</funding-statement></funding-group><custom-meta-group><custom-meta specific-use="meta-only"><meta-name>Author impact statement</meta-name><meta-value>Predicted effector genes at loci associated with abdominal obesity but protection from type 2 diabetes likely effect intermediate anthropometric and diabetic phenotypes.</meta-value></custom-meta></custom-meta-group></article-meta></front><body><sec id="s1" sec-type="intro"><title>Introduction</title><p>Metabolic syndrome (MetSyn) is a cluster of dysregulated metabolic conditions that tend to occur together to increase the risk for cardiometabolic disorders such as type 2 diabetes (T2D) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib63">Lusis, 2006</xref>). This cluster includes insulin resistance (IR), abdominal obesity, elevated serum triglycerides (TG) levels, low high-density lipoprotein cholesterol levels, as well as elevated systolic and diastolic blood pressure. Obesity, or the excessive accumulation of fat that presents a risk to health, is a major contributor to MetSyn (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib63">Lusis, 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Feero et al., 2010</xref>). Obesity, which is typically defined as a body mass index (BMI) above 30, has reached unprecedented levels of prevalence, and its role as a central regulator of disease risk makes it an appealing therapeutic target (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Feero et al., 2010</xref>). Several recently developed T2D therapeutics have even successfully targeted obesity; SGLT2 inhibitors and GLP-1 agonists have been reported to result in a 2–6 kg reduction of body weight and reduced IR (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Brown et al., 2021</xref>).</p><p>Despite the promise of these obesity-centered therapeutic strategies, there has also been a growing body of evidence describing a rare phenotype known as metabolically healthy obesity (MHO) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Blüher, 2020</xref>). MHO describes a group of phenotypes in which individuals with obesity are protected from adverse metabolic effects (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib75">Smith et al., 2019</xref>). While no formal definition of MHO exists, it is often described as either obesity with less than three components of MetSyn, or obesity without IR as computed by the homeostasis model assessment of insulin resistance (HOMA-IR) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib75">Smith et al., 2019</xref>). Mechanisms proposed to mediate this include depressed ectopic fat accumulation, subcutaneous adipose tissue (SAT) expansion plasticity, and shifts in fat storage from the abdomen to the legs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Blüher, 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib75">Smith et al., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib59">Loos and Kilpeläinen, 2018</xref>). In recent years the ability of abdominal obesity to mediate cardiometabolic disease risk has gained attention. People with MHO have less intra-abdominal fat accumulation compared to people with metabolically unhealthy obesity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib45">Klöting et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib41">Karelis et al., 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Chen et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">Jennings et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">Hayes et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib46">Koster et al., 2010</xref>). Intra-abdominal fat accumulation can be approximated through the ratio of waist-to-hip circumference (WHR) adjusted for BMI (WHRadjBMI). WHRadjBMI is a causal factor that increases susceptibility for T2D, but the genetic and molecular mechanisms underlying fat distribution remain largely unknown (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Emdin et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Gill et al., 2021</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib52">Li et al., 2021</xref>). Understanding the mechanisms mediating WHRadjBMI, MHO, and T2D is critical to our understanding of disease pathogenesis and to clinical strategies to treat MetSyn.</p><p>Most of the genetic mechanisms of MHO described have been associated with increased BMI without increased disease risk. For example, the missense variant rs373863828 in CREB3 regulatory factor has been shown to increase BMI without a corresponding increase in HOMA-IR and circulating TG, or a decrease in circulating adiponectin (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib67">Minster et al., 2016</xref>). Ob/ob mice with overexpression of adiponectin but lacking in leptin are shown to accumulate considerable fat mass without a corresponding increase in insulin sensitivity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib43">Kim et al., 2007</xref>). In contrast, the genetic loci associated with increased WHRadjBMI but without increased disease risk have not yet been described. To date, all genes that have been shown to increase fat accumulation into abdominal fat depots have also been shown to increase the risk for T2D (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Fathzadeh et al., 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib74">Small et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib86">Yang et al., 2022</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Gesta et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib58">Loh et al., 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib57">Loh et al., 2015</xref>).</p><p>As complex traits with both environmental and genetic risk factors, abdominal obesity and T2D have been the subject of multiple genome-wide association studies (GWAS). While GWAS have identified hundreds of genetic loci associated with abdominal obesity and T2D, moving from association to mechanism at a locus is not trivial. The use of colocalization analysis (COLOC), which identifies loci that contain shared genetic architecture for multiple traits of interest, can inform mechanistic hypotheses moving from association to function by integrating data from multiple studies (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">Hukku et al., 2021</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib80">Wallace, 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib79">Wallace et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib81">Wallace, 2020</xref>). For example, the colocalization of a GWAS signal with genetic regulation of genes at quantitative trait loci (QTLs) implies a mechanistic relationship between the regulated gene and GWAS trait (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">Hormozdiari et al., 2016</xref>). Another recently developed approach named Tissue of ACTion scores for Investigating Complex trait-Associated Loci (TACTICAL) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib77">Torres et al., 2020</xref>) incorporates gene expression data, and epigenetic annotations with GWAS associations to predict the causal eGenes and tissues of action at GWAS loci. These methods have been used to inform data-driven mechanistic predictions at GWAS loci that have been experimentally validated and can recall previously validated loci as positive controls.</p><p>To advance the understanding of mechanisms linking body fat distribution to T2D risk, independent of overall obesity, we used COLOC and TACTICAL to predict the mechanisms of action at genetic loci associated with both T2D and WHR, both adjusted for the BMI. Using the most recent GWAS summary statistics, QTL summary statistics, tissue-specific gene expression data, and high-resolution epigenetic annotations, we predicted the shared genetic architecture of T2DadjBMI and WHRadjBMI at 79 genetic loci. Here, we present the identification of five loci that contained association signals with discordant effects on abdominal fat and T2D risk, meaning that the allele of the lead variant associated with protection from T2D was associated with increased abdominal fat accumulation. We predicted the eGenes and tissues of action at these five loci and explored the relationship between adipose eGene expression with cellular and physiological phenotypes. Here, we provide data-driven hypotheses about predicted candidate causal eGenes at GWAS loci with associations that recall metabolically healthy abdominal obesity.</p></sec><sec id="s2" sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><sec id="s2-1"><title>Colocalization analysis of genetic loci associated with T2D and body fat distribution predicts colocalization of discordant T2DadjBMI and WHRadjBMI association signals at six association signals</title><p>To identify genetic loci which contained pleiotropic association signals for both T2DadjBMI and WHRadjBMI, we performed colocalization analysis (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1A</xref>). This analysis yielded 79 genetic loci where a single variant was significantly associated with both T2DadjBMI and WHRadjBMI. We obtained the 99% credible set of variants in colocalized loci (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="supp1">Supplementary file 1</xref>) and discovered the presence of 143 variants in five loci associated with discordant effects on T2DadjBMI and WHRadjBMI. We also discovered 851 SNPs in 73 loci with the expected concordant effects on both traits. Although almost all of the representative lead discordant variants reached genome-wide significance, two associations reached nominal significance (p&lt;5e-05). Because of recent work demonstrating that even variants with only nominal and local significance in GWAS can also have functional relevance to GWAS traits, we included variants prioritized in the 99% credible set but with only nominal significance (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib50">Li et al., 2020a</xref>). We then performed fine-mapping of the causal variants in each locus containing a discordant association signal while relaxing the assumption of a single causal variant per locus. In four of the five loci, this fine-mapping recalled only one likely candidate causal signal. In the 5q21.1 locus, SuSiE identified a secondary association signal that was also associated with discordant effects on T2DadjBMI and WHRadjBMI (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1B</xref> and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="supp2">Supplementary file 2</xref>). To parse the associations between specific components of WHRadjBMI, including WC, HC, WHR, and BMI, with both T2D and T2DadjBMI, we performed multi-trait colocalization analysis with Hyprcoloc of the associations at discordant loci (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="supp3">Supplementary file 3</xref>). At three of the five discordant loci, the discordant association signals were also colocalized with WHRadjBMI component traits waist circumference (WC) and WHR.</p><fig id="fig1" position="float"><label>Figure 1.</label><caption><title>Analysis summary and discordant variant characteristics.</title><p>(<bold>A</bold>) Summary of analysis pipeline and generated results.

We used the most highly powered GWAS or GWAS meta-analysis for each trait included in our PheWAS and queried the summary statistics for the associations of each lead discordant variant (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1C</xref>). This query revealed consistent significant associations with discordance across anthropometric and glycemic traits in each locus. At the association signal in the 5q11.2 region, association signals exemplified this metabolic discordance. Represented by genetic variant rs459193, the association signal was associated with increased abdominal obesity in nearly every metric, but also with protection from T2D in nearly every metric. At all lead discordant variants, effects were consistent with a phenotype of increased abdominal obesity but protection from T2D.</p><p>We then queried the variant effect predictor (VEP) to discover genetic variant annotations (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib65">McLaren et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1D</xref> and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="supp4">Supplementary file 4</xref>). VEP predicted that discordant variants overwhelmingly lie in noncoding regions of the genome, with only one missense variant in a coding region. Because the vast majority of discordant variants lie in noncoding regions, it is likely their function lies in altering genetic regulation of proximal genes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Civelek and Lusis, 2014</xref>). Therefore, we investigated the coincidence of these discordant variants with the genetic regulation of proximal genes with functional prediction methods.</p></sec><sec id="s2-2"><title>Integration of molecular QTLs and genomic annotations to predict functional genes in tissues of action at discordant genetic loci</title><p>To investigate the role of eGenes in physiological phenotypes and cellular phenotypes, we evaluated the correlation of adipose tissue eGene expression and T2D-relevant phenotypes since these correlations can reveal biologically relevant functional relationships (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Civelek et al., 2017</xref>). To predict the genes and tissues of function at discordant loci, we used publicly available multi-omic data from metabolically relevant tissue-specific resources to predict functional mechanisms underlying associations. We first interrogated where the 143 discordant variants in the credible set were located in relation to tissue-specific chromatin state data in pancreatic islet, adipose, liver, and skeletal muscle tissues (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib43">Kim et al., 2007</xref>). We computed the enrichment of colocalized association signals in various chromatin state annotations in each of these tissues (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2A</xref>). We noted the specific enrichment of adipose tissue chromatin states of high activity, such as active transcription start sites, enhancer regions, and areas of transcriptional activity. For every other tissue, the leading annotations represented areas of decreased transcriptional activity. We additionally queried 3D chromatin data for discordant variant enhancer/promoter contact but did not find any significant interactions (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="fig2sdata1">Figure 2—source data 1</xref>). We then used these enrichment scores, chromatin states, and gene expression data to predict the functional tissues at each colocalized locus (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="supp5">Supplementary file 5</xref>). We predicted that adipose tissue was classified as the candidate tissue of action (TOA) at three loci, and skeletal muscle and liver tissue shared classification with adipose tissue at the remaining two discordant loci (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2B</xref>).</p><fig id="fig2" position="float"><label>Figure 2.</label><caption><title>Predicting functional tissues and effector genes at discordant loci.</title><p>(<bold>A</bold>) Tissue-specific enrichment of chromatin states of variants in the 99% credible set of colocalized variants.

Colocalization of a GWAS association signal with a genetic regulatory association signal can be used to prioritize mechanisms underlying association. We obtained expression QTL (eQTL) and splicing QTL (sQTL) summary statistics from multiple cohorts and tissue groups (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="fig2sdata1">Figure 2—source data 1</xref>). We extracted eQTL summary statistics for all genes within 1 Mb of the lead variant of all discordant colocalized loci from adipose, pancreatic, skeletal muscle, and liver tissues. We extracted sQTL summary statistics for all genes within 1 Mb of the lead variant of all discordant colocalized loci for adipose tissue data that was available. We used Summary-based Mendelian Randomization (SMR) and Coloc.abf to perform GWAS-QTL colocalization and used the framework developed by Hukku et al. to reconcile the results of SMR and Coloc.abf. In this framework, colocalization found using Coloc.abf but not with SMR potentially represents signals with horizontal pleiotropy, whereas colocalization found through SMR but not through Coloc.abf potentially represents locus-level colocalization (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">Hukku et al., 2021</xref>). Colocalization found using both methods represents the identification of candidate causal effector transcripts. Our colocalization analysis revealed seven candidate causal effector transcripts at three of the five discordant loci (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2C</xref>). With Coloc.abf, we predicted four putative eGenes in these two loci. At the 2p21 locus, we predicted <italic>THADA-AS</italic> (SAT, VAT) to be the sole eGene. At the 5q21.1 locus, we predicted <italic>GIN1</italic> (SAT), <italic>PAM</italic> (SAT &amp; SKM), and <italic>PPIP5K2</italic> (SAT) to be the eGenes. The association signal at rs6860588 was associated with a novel alternative splicing isoform of <italic>PAM</italic> in SAT, which skips the 14th exon. Using SMR, we predicted four eGenes at two discordant loci. At the 5q21.1 locus, we predicted that the genetic association signal represented by rs6860588 was also associated with the regulation of <italic>EIF3KP1</italic> (SAT, VAT, SKM, PANC), <italic>PPIP5K2</italic> (SAT)<italic>,</italic> and <italic>GIN1</italic> (SAT, SKM, PANC). At the discordant association signal in the 19q13.11 locus, we predicted that the genetic association signal represented by variant rs3786897 was also associated with the regulation of <italic>PEPD</italic> (SAT, VAT). As the colocalization transcripts <italic>GIN1</italic> and <italic>PPIP5K2</italic> were replicated with both methods (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="supp6 supp7">Supplementary files 6 and 7</xref>), these represent high-confidence predictions of potentially causal effector transcripts underlying the genetic association with discordance in the 5q21.1 locus. We queried white adipose tissue single-cell RNA sequencing data (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Emont et al., 2022</xref>) for discordant association signal eGenes and found that eGenes were expressed in adipocytes and adipocyte progenitor stem cells (ASPCs) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2D</xref>). Because body fat distribution associations are driven by ASPCs and adipocytes in adipose tissues (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib61">Lu et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib56">Locke et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Hansen et al., 2023</xref>), we reasoned that exploring adipose expression data could help to explain discordant associations.

We used SAT transcriptomic data from the 426 men of the METSIM cohort to investigate how adipose tissue expression of discordant locus eGenes was related to 23 metabolic phenotypes underlying T2D and abdominal fat accumulation (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="fig3sdata1">Figure 3—source data 1</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Brotman et al., 2022</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib47">Laakso et al., 2017</xref>). We extracted adipose tissue gene expression data for eGenes. Gene expression data were available for six of the seven eGenes. We additionally extracted splice junction expression data for the only gene with a colocalized splice junction, <italic>PAM</italic>. We then computed the biweight midcorrelation of transcript counts or splice junction counts with 23 metabolic phenotypes. We found significant (false discovery rate [FDR] &lt;0.05) correlations of adipose tissue gene expression of three genes with 13 phenotypes (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3A</xref>). We found that adipose tissue expression of <italic>THADA-AS</italic>, <italic>PEPD</italic>, and <italic>GIN1</italic> was significantly correlated with inflammatory, glycemic, and anthropometric phenotypes. SAT <italic>THADA-AS</italic> expression was positively correlated with IR, abdominal fat accumulation, and serum triglyceride levels, but with higher levels of plasma interleukin-1 receptor antagonist (IL-1RA) and C-reactive protein (CRP). IL-1RA plays a protective role in resolving inflammation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib78">Volarevic et al., 2010</xref>), and elevated levels have been linked to prediabetes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib62">Luotola, 2022</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Grossmann et al., 2015</xref>). CRP has been used as a biomarker of increased inflammation in chronic diseases (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">Herwald and Egesten, 2021</xref>). The eQTL and GWAS data are associated with decreased expression of THADA-AS, which is consistent with the protection from IR in the correlation data but not with the increased abdominal obesity and inflammation. We are unable to resolve this correlation evidence with the discordance, but because the METSIM cohort was collected using single-end RNA sequencing, parsing the correlations of THADA and THADA-AS is difficult (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib49">Li et al., 2013</xref>). SAT expression of <italic>GIN1</italic> was correlated with higher plasma adiponectin. Adiponectin, secreted by adipocytes, increases insulin sensitivity, and this provides a mechanism for protection from T2D (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Achari and Jain, 2017</xref>). This expression is consistent with the QTL and GWAS data, providing a direct potential mechanism linking the eQTL to protection from T2D. SAT <italic>PEPD</italic> expression was also positively correlated with plasma IL-1RA levels. The QTL at this locus is associated with decreased expression of PEPD, providing another direct potential mechanism linking the eQTL to protection from T2D. Through this correlation analysis, we were able to predict the physiological consequences of eGenes at three discordant loci.</p><fig id="fig3" position="float"><label>Figure 3.</label><caption><title>Predicted physiological and cellular effects of effector genes (eGenes) on metabolic phenotypes and adipogenesis.</title><p>(<bold>A</bold>) Biweight midcorrelation of adipose tissue eGenes expression with metabolic phenotypes (false discovery rate [FDR] &lt;5%).

The T allele of rs6860588 is associated with protection from T2D, increased abdominal obesity, decreased SAT expression of <italic>GIN1</italic>, increased SKM expression of <italic>PAM</italic>, decreased SAT expression of <italic>PPIP5K2</italic>, increased SAT expression of a <italic>PAM</italic> splice variant with a skipped exon 14, and decreased SAT expression of the canonical <italic>PAM</italic> splice junctions, exon 13:14 and exon 14:15 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4A</xref>; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s1">Figure 4—figure supplement 1</xref> and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="fig4sdata1">Figure 4—source data 1</xref>). While the eGenes, <italic>PAM</italic>, <italic>GIN1</italic>, and <italic>PPIP5K2</italic>, have not been studied in the context of obesity and metabolism, they have been studied for their function in other cell types. We found that GIN1 and PAM were dynamically expressed over the course of adipogenesis (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3B</xref>). <italic>GIN1</italic> has been hypothesized to be a key regulator of energy metabolism in atria (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib51">Li et al., 2020b</xref>), but little is known about gypsy integrases and their molecular function. PAM facilitates C-terminus glycine residue amidation, which can catalyze protein potency (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib76">Thomsen et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib66">Merkler, 1994</xref>). PAM additionally has been linked to metabolic phenotypes in multiple model organisms, where its deficiency is associated with decreased peptide secretion and potency critical to insulin release, but not with increased diabetes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Chen et al., 2020a</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib90">Zieliński et al., 2016</xref>). PAM loss of function likely results in deficient peptide synthesis and secretion in adipocytes as well, and its increase of function likely results in increased myokine signaling from skeletal muscle. Knockdown of PPIP5Ks results in decreased proliferation, increased mitochondrial mass, decreased inositol metabolism, and accelerated glycolysis in tumor cell lines (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">Gu et al., 2021</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">Gu et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Badodi et al., 2021</xref>). We did not observe significant interactions between adipose <italic>PPIP5K2</italic> expression and adipogenesis or metabolic phenotypes, but this does not rule out a role for PPIP5K2 in the metabolic discordance at 5q21.1. Thus, we propose that the T allele at rs6860588 regulates a group of genes that promotes adipogenesis, glycolysis, and inflammation in white adipose tissue while simultaneously decreasing preadipocyte expansion and increasing skeletal muscle peptide secretion and potency (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4B</xref>).

We predicted the colocalization of T2DadjBMI and WHRadjBMI association signals at 79 genetic loci. The protective allele of six association signals was associated with lower T2D risk but higher abdominal fat accumulation, independent of overall obesity (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1</xref>). By analyzing colocalization with molecular QTLs, computing the enrichment of variants in epigenomic and genomic annotations, and comparing tissue-specific gene expression, we predicted the eGenes and tissues of action at discordant association signals (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2</xref>). We found significant evidence that adipose tissue biology is a significant contributor at colocalized loci. We then explored the effects of eGenes expression in adipose tissue and preadipocytes on adipogenesis metabolic phenotypes (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3</xref>) and proposed a model by which the genetic variant rs6860588 might confer protection from T2D but increased abdominal obesity (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4</xref>).</p><p>The six genetic association signals associated with discordant metabolic phenotypes offer potential insight into the genetic mechanisms underlying risk stratification of T2D risk within abdominal obesity. While mechanisms promoting MHO have been described, most have focused on body fat distribution. Defining more mechanisms that promote MHO is critical as rates of obesity rise globally. Complicating the study of MHO is the lack of precision in its definition. Some definitions include obesity with less than three components of MetSyn, obesity with healthy HOMA-IR, or even obesity with the lack of a metabolic and cardiovascular disorder (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Blüher, 2020</xref>). MHO has been controversial and termed an intermediate state (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Caleyachetty et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib72">Rey-López et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Blüher, 2017</xref>), but a growing body of evidence has accumulated providing evidence that genetic mechanisms influence predisposition to it. In Samoans, the common <italic>CREBRF</italic> coding variant rs12513649 increases BMI and overall adiposity but protects from IR (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib50">Li et al., 2020a</xref>). Additionally, <italic>IRS1</italic>, <italic>COBLL1</italic>, <italic>PLA2G6</italic>, and <italic>TOMM40</italic> have been associated with higher BMI but with protective lipidemic and glycemic traits (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib59">Loos and Kilpeläinen, 2018</xref>). The physiological functions of these genes have been proposed to involve adipose tissue caloric load capacity and body fat distribution (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib59">Loos and Kilpeläinen, 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib61">Lu et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib42">Kilpeläinen et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib60">Lotta et al., 2017</xref>).</p><p>While abdominal fat accumulation is known to be one of the strongest predictors of obesity-related complications (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Emdin et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Censin et al., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Dale et al., 2017</xref>), our findings point to mechanisms that contradict this trend. Each locus must be functionally annotated before translating the association results to the clinic. If these discordant variants are functionally annotated and fully characterized, they might have clinical utility to T2D risk allele carriers and inform personalized therapeutic strategies. Discovering mechanisms uncoupling abdominal obesity from T2D can aid in personalized therapeutic strategies and in understanding personalized risk stratification. Risk-stratified personalized obesity treatment could prioritize patients that would or would not benefit significantly from weight-loss interventions, and use genotype as a biomarker for patients who would benefit from other therapeutic strategies (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib44">Klonoff, 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib85">Williams et al., 2022</xref>). Thus, the importance of personalized risk stratification for T2D will only increase as abdominal obesity becomes more prevalent. Personalized risk stratification with an understanding of specific molecular, cellular, and physiological mechanisms will aid in the prioritization of effective therapies. This investigation provided specific hypotheses linking functional genes at discordant loci to tissues of action for experimental follow-up in vitro and in vivo. Functional characterization of the effect of these genes on insulin uptake, preadipocyte proliferation, and adipogenesis, as well as secretome characterization, will elucidate precise mechanisms through which these eGenes might contribute to the discordant association signals.</p><p>We predicted tissues and mechanisms of action at five loci containing six discordant association signals with increased abdominal obesity and protection for T2D. A particular example of a peculiar metabolic discordance was revealed at the 2p21 locus containing <italic>THADA</italic> and <italic>THADA-AS</italic>, represented by variant rs6752964 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s2">Figure 4—figure supplement 2</xref>). The associations have been replicated multiple times (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib64">Mahajan et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib87">Zeggini et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Grarup et al., 2008</xref>), but the exact mechanisms underlying this association are unknown. <italic>THADA</italic> plays an evolutionarily conserved role in intracellular calcium signaling and consequently non-shivering thermogenesis. In <italic>Drosophila melanogaster</italic>, <italic>thada</italic> knockout flies developed obesity and hyperphagia without altered circulating glucose levels (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib68">Moraru et al., 2017</xref>). In mice, pancreatic <italic>Thada</italic> knockout resulted in protection from T2D through the preservation of β-cell mass and improvement of β-cell function (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib88">Zhang et al., 2023</xref>). Mendelian randomization studies in humans have likewise found consistent links between THADA and adiposity, but have not yet been able to link it to diabetic phenotypes such as insulin secretion (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Grarup et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib73">Simonis-Bik et al., 2010</xref>). Our investigation revealed relationships between THADA and THADA-AS expression with diabetic and obesity-abdominal obesity phenotypes, as well as dynamic expression in adipogenesis (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3</xref>). Regulatory interactions whereby <italic>THADA-AS</italic> expression interferes with <italic>THADA</italic> transcription could provide a basis by which variant rs6752964 might confer abdominal obesity, but protection from T2D (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Brantl, 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Faghihi and Wahlestedt, 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib84">Wight and Werner, 2013</xref>). Further, we also found colocalization of genetic regulation of <italic>PEPD</italic> in adipose tissue with the discordant association signal represented by variant rs3786897. Depletion of <italic>PEPD</italic> in preadipocytes has been shown to reduce adipogenic potential, decrease triglyceride accumulation, and phospho-Akt signaling, which is critical to insulin sensitivity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Chen et al., 2020b</xref>). Notably, a secondary signal represented by variant rs731839 was apparent in this locus but was not significant for WHRadjBMI. This signal has been associated with sex-specific effects on serum lipid levels in Han and Mulao populations (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib53">Lin et al., 2014</xref>). Further in vivo and in vitro work must be done to resolve this multi-tissue, multi-eGene locus.</p><p>Although our analysis incorporated genome, transcriptome, epigenome, and phenome data in multiple cohorts, and used the consensus of orthogonal methods to predict the mechanisms of action at discordant loci, follow-up is required to validate each prediction. Additionally, our genetic expression data used single-strand sequencing, and therefore parsing out the associated effects of sense and antisense transcripts is difficult. Finally, it is critical to discover to diversify ancestry and sex in genetic association studies to identify more genetic loci underlying MHO. Without experimental follow-up and extensive clinical studies, genotype should not be used as a diagnostic metric. CRISPR editing of alleles in relevant cell types to study <italic>cis</italic>-regulatory effects on genes and phenotypic effects on cells, and work in animal models is necessary to fully annotate these loci. In addition, it is important to identify the indirect and direct effects of discordant variants, as these endocrine tissues are major contributors to peptide and hormone secretion. Further experimental characterization is critical to placing these results in the proper context and providing the basis for personalized interventions for T2D. The predictions at these six signals provide specific hypotheses to be tested, and should they be validated experimentally provide knowledge of the precise mechanisms of uncoupling obesity from T2D risk.</p></sec><sec id="s4" sec-type="methods"><title>Methods</title><sec id="s4-1"><title>GWAS-GWAS colocalization analysis</title><p>GWAS results for T2DadjBMI and WHRadjBMI were obtained from <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib64">Mahajan et al., 2018</xref>, and <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib71">Pulit et al., 2019</xref>.

We also obtained SAT sQTL results from the METSIM cohort. Data sources and further information are detailed in <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="fig2sdata1">Figure 2—source data 1</xref>. We extracted the QTL data for each gene or transcript within 1 Mb of a discordant locus start or end site and independently colocalized with the T2DadjBMI and WHRadjBMI GWAS using Coloc.abf and SMR. When implementing Coloc.abf, we considered a signal to be colocalized if PPH4 was greater than 0.50 (a threshold used for GWAS-QTL colocalization in admixed populations; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Gay et al., 2020</xref>). We repeated the analysis in SMR and used an FDR threshold of 5% to control for false positives. We then performed a visual inspection of GWAS-QTL colocalization of plots generated by LocusCompare. If a GWAS-QTL colocalization met these criteria, the proximal gene was termed an eGene.</p></sec><sec id="s4-7"><title>fGWAS annotation enrichment analysis</title><p>We used the functional GWAS (fGWAS) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib70">Pickrell, 2014</xref>) command-line tool to compute the enrichment of associations, in particular genomic and epigenomic regions. We first obtained the chromosome and base-pair position of each variant in the 99% credible set from each of the 79 colocalized loci. We mapped the SNPs to their placement in genomic regions using bed files. We used bed files from tissue-specific chromatin state data (adipose, liver, pancreatic islet, and skeletal muscle) and genome-level coding region annotations, and mapped SNPs to their presence in these regions. From these maps, we performed enrichment analysis with the complete model of all annotations with the -fine and -xv flags on fGWAS. We used the natural log of the Bayes factor of the colocalization test and computed the enrichment of SNPs for presence in coding regions to genetic and epigenetic annotations.</p></sec><sec id="s4-8"><title>TOA analysis</title><p>We conducted TOA score analysis using the credible set of SNPs from each of the 79 colocalized loci. TACTICAL computes the TOA score with the SNP-level Bayesian probabilities, the SNP annotation maps, and the annotation enrichment scores. We used the Coloc.abf PPH4 scores for the SNP-level Bayesian probability, the fGWAS annotation enrichment scores, and the SNP annotation maps to compute the TOA score at all colocalized loci. We separated independent association signals in the same loci (LD &lt;0.5) with HaploReg (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib83">Ward and Kellis, 2016</xref>). With TACTICAL (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib77">Torres et al., 2020</xref>), we integrated the credible set of SNPs with the enrichment for genome-level and tissue-specific annotations. We used the default tissue classification thresholds of 0.20 to classify signals as belonging to a particular TOA and less than 0.10 difference to classify signals as sharing TOA assignments between multiple tissues.</p></sec><sec id="s4-9"><title>Gene expression and phenotype correlation analysis</title><p>For each eGene, we computed the biweight midcorrelation and its significance, as implemented by the Weighted Genetic Coexpression Network Analysis (WGCNA) package (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib48">Langfelder and Horvath, 2008</xref>), between gene expression with metabolic phenotypes measured in the METSIM cohort (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib47">Laakso et al., 2017</xref>). We controlled for false positives with a 5% FDR threshold as implemented by the q-values package in R (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib40">John, 2002</xref>).</p></sec><sec id="s4-10"><title>Adipogenesis gene expression dynamics analysis</title><p>We obtained Simpson-Golabi-Behmel syndrome preadipocyte adipogenesis time series gene expression data from GEO (accession number GSE76131) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib69">Nassiri et al., 2016</xref>). We evaluated the dynamic expression of each adipose tissue eGene by fitting the gene expression over time to a linear model and applying the likelihood ratio test (LRT) to compare the time-dependent models to time-independent null models. We considered an eGene to be dynamically expressed in adipogenesis if the p-value of the LRT was less than 0.05.</p></sec></sec></body><back><sec sec-type="additional-information" id="s5"><title>Additional information</title><fn-group content-type="competing-interest"><title>Competing interests</title><fn fn-type="COI-statement" id="conf1"><p>No competing interests declared</p></fn></fn-group><fn-group content-type="author-contribution"><title>Author contributions</title><fn fn-type="con" id="con1"><p>Conceptualization, Data curation, Software, Formal analysis, Funding acquisition, Validation, Investigation, Visualization, Methodology, Writing - original draft, Project administration, Writing - review and editing</p></fn><fn fn-type="con" id="con2"><p>Resources, Data curation, Software, Formal analysis, Investigation, Methodology, Writing - review and editing</p></fn><fn fn-type="con" id="con3"><p>Resources, Data curation, Supervision, Methodology, Project administration, Writing - review and editing</p></fn><fn fn-type="con" id="con4"><p>Conceptualization, Resources, Data curation, Supervision, Funding acquisition, Validation, Methodology, Project administration, Writing - review and editing</p></fn></fn-group></sec><sec sec-type="supplementary-material" id="s6"><title>Additional files</title><supplementary-material id="supp1"><label>Supplementary file 1.</label><caption><title>Credible set of genetic variants in T2DadjBMI and WHRadjBMI colocalized loci.</title></caption><media xlink:href="elife-79834-supp1-v1.xlsx" mimetype="application" mime-subtype="xlsx"/></supplementary-material><supplementary-material id="supp2"><label>Supplementary file 2.</label><caption><title>Finemapping analysis of association signals in loci containing discordant association signals.</title></caption><media xlink:href="elife-79834-supp2-v1.xlsx" mimetype="application" mime-subtype="xlsx"/></supplementary-material><supplementary-material id="supp3"><label>Supplementary file 3.</label><caption><title>Multi-trait colocalization of body fat distribution component traits in discordant loci.</title></caption><media xlink:href="elife-79834-supp3-v1.xlsx" mimetype="application" mime-subtype="xlsx"/></supplementary-material><supplementary-material id="supp4"><label>Supplementary file 4.</label><caption><title>Variant effect predictions of discordant variants.</title></caption><media xlink:href="elife-79834-supp4-v1.xlsx" mimetype="application" mime-subtype="xlsx"/></supplementary-material><supplementary-material id="supp5"><label>Supplementary file 5.</label><caption><title>Tissue of action scores at colocalized loci.</title></caption><media xlink:href="elife-79834-supp5-v1.xlsx" mimetype="application" mime-subtype="xlsx"/></supplementary-material><supplementary-material id="supp6"><label>Supplementary file 6.</label><caption><title>Significant eQTL and sQTL colocalization results in coloc.</title></caption><media xlink:href="elife-79834-supp6-v1.xlsx" mimetype="application" mime-subtype="xlsx"/></supplementary-material><supplementary-material id="supp7"><label>Supplementary file 7.</label><caption><title>Significant eQTL and sQTL colocalization results in SMR.</title></caption><media xlink:href="elife-79834-supp7-v1.xlsx" mimetype="application" mime-subtype="xlsx"/></supplementary-material><supplementary-material id="mdar"><label>MDAR checklist</label><media xlink:href="elife-79834-mdarchecklist1-v1.pdf" mimetype="application" mime-subtype="pdf"/></supplementary-material></sec><sec sec-type="data-availability" id="s7"><title>Data availability</title><p>The current manuscript is a computational investigation using publicly available data, so no data have been generated for this manuscript.

Your article has been reviewed by 3 peer reviewers, including Tune H Pers as the Reviewing Editor and Reviewer #1, and the evaluation has been overseen by David James as the Senior Editor. The following individual involved in review of your submission has agreed to reveal their identity: Marcel den Hoed (Reviewer #2).</p><p>The reviewers have discussed their reviews with one another, and the Reviewing Editor has drafted this to help you prepare a revised submission.</p><p>Essential revisions:</p><p>1) Please carefully address, through additional analyses, the comments related to whether the proposed effector genes are likely &quot;healthy obesity genes&quot;, or whether there are at these loci either multiple causal genes per locus, or single causal genes acting on different traits via different tissues and mechanisms.</p><p>2) Please carefully address the comments on WHRadjBMI being a trait that is complicated to interpret due to its composite structure, ideally by including analyses focusing on the two different fat depots that the WHR measure is based on.</p><p>3) Please address, where appropriate through additional analyses, all remaining comments raised by the three referees.</p><p><italic>Reviewer #2 (Recommendations for the authors):</italic></p><p>I read your manuscript with great interest and think the findings are interesting. Nevertheless, I hope the points raised below can help make the manuscript even better, and help support some of the conclusions drawn.</p><p>1. The trait that is WHRadjBMI has puzzled me for a while. Ratios can be problematic per se if two traits have a non-zero intercept (I am not sure if this is the case for WC and HC?), and adjusting for a heritable trait (BMI) may introduce collider bias, as was elegantly shown by Day et al. (https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/26849114/). As a result, an association with WHRadjBMI may not reflect the same biological phenomenon for each locus. Hence, in addition to associations with WHRadjBMI and T2DadjBMI, it would be informative to also show summary statistics for associations of these loci with waist circumference, hip circumference, BMI and T2D in Figure 1.</p><p>2. By running a co-localization analysis with sets of SNPs within 200kb of a genome-wide significant SNP in either GWAS, the number of truly co-localizing signals may be underestimated due to secondary association signals in either or both GWASs. It could be worthwhile to additionally run conditional analyses for each outcome to identify such loci and run the co-localization analysis for each association signal separately.</p><p>3. The authors state that associations were considered discordant if the z-score had an opposite direction for the same allele. Presumably, the association with both traits also needed to be significant?</p><p>4. In a best-case scenario, WHRadjBMI indeed reflects abdominal obesity, as intended. However, associations with WHRadjBMI then reflect the net association with adiposity across all individual abdominal fat depots. This does not tell us which lipid depot(s) drive(s) the association with WHRadjBMI. Could the authors explore associations with e.g., liver fat and pancreas fat as derived by MRI in UK biobank data for these six loci?</p><p>5. Associations don't provide insights into causal pathways or directions of effect. Hence, I suggest refraining from using causal language, e.g., in line 75: &quot;protecting against T2D but increasing abdominal fat accumulation&quot;. Even if a causal variant acts on both outcomes through a single causal gene and pathway (both are debatable at this stage), then there are still four possible courses of action. Similarly, in the discussion (line 237) the authors state that: &quot;increased expression of THADA-AS results in increased abdominal fat accumulation but decreased T2D risk&quot;. No evidence was provided that justifies this conclusion based on an association.</p><p>6. Even if there is only one causal gene, its effects on different outcomes may be mediated by multiple tissues and cell types (and thus, mechanisms). Since all six loci showing directionally discordant associations with WHRadjBMI and T2DadjBMI are located in non-coding regions, these loci likely have a regulatory role, e.g., as enhancers. Hence, the seemingly directionally discordant associations may well be mediated by more than one causal gene. I would argue that neither the &quot;one gene, multiple pathways&quot; nor the &quot;multiple genes&quot; scenarios reflect uncoupling.</p><p>7. Co-localization of credible variants with sQTLs and eQTLs does not mean that such genes are causal for the traits of interest, as the association between the expression of a gene X and the outcome of interest can be confounded by the expression of the truly causal gene Y, with the expression of both genes X and Y influenced by the enhancer that is flagged by the causal variant. To get one step closer to such inference, it would be informative if the authors could show chromatin-chromatin interaction data for credible variants in all six discordant loci, across all relevant cell types.</p><p>8. Gene prioritization is a fast-moving field, and a range of bioinformatics approaches – but no gold standard – are available to prioritize candidate genes. Results using proof-of-concept loci have not shown very convincing results for the predictive ability of eQTL associations to flag causal genes, even in the presence of co-localization. Hence, it would be informative to see which genes are prioritized in these loci by other available approaches – including but not limited to chromatin accessibility QTLs in relevant cell types – and if there is consensus across those approaches as to which gene(s) are likely causal.</p><p>9. Even if there are loci that uncouple genetic effects on abdominal adiposity and risk of type-2 diabetes, the causal beneficial effect of weight loss is so large in comparison that it would no doubt remain advisable for most if not all individuals to lose weight to reduce the risk of T2D and its complications.</p><p>10. Why was ATAC-sec data provided for only one of six discordant loci? In the discussion the authors state that tissues and mechanisms of action are predicted for six loci, but only one or two are described in the paper.</p><p><italic>Reviewer #3 (Recommendations for the authors):</italic></p><p>1. The rationale for the study is unclear. The authors introduce the study as an investigation into factors explaining individual differences in the relationship between obesity and cardiometabolic health, particularly the &quot;metabolically healthy obesity&quot; and &quot;lean, insulin resistance&quot; phenotypes. However, the analyses use outcome phenotypes that are adjusted for BMI (i.e. obesity): WHRadjBMI and T2DadjBMI. Thus, the results do not explain differences in obesity status and metabolic health, but rather tell about differences in body fat distribution and T2D risk, independent of obesity. Furthermore, a relatively low abdominal fat accumulation is one of the key characteristics of the &quot;metabolically healthy obesity&quot; phenotype associated with lower T2D risk, while the &quot;lean, insulin resistance&quot; phenotype associated with increased T2D risk, is characterized by relative increase in abdominal adiposity. Thus, the discordant association pattern of relatively higher abdominal adiposity but lower risk of T2D, investigated by the authors, does not exemplify either of these two phenotypes. Could the authors think of a biological or clinical example that could represent the discordant genetic association pattern they are aiming to characterize, in order to create a more plausible rationale for the present analyses?</p><p>2. Overall, it is difficult to imagine a plausible biological explanation for a relationship where higher WHRadjBMI would mediate a lower risk of T2DadjBMI. It would be really interesting is such biology exists, but at the moment the paper does not give much help to the reader in interpreting what biological mechanism could underlie such a relationship. An alternative explanation for the findings is the possibility that the genetic effects are driven by independent effects of the same genes on biological pathways in two separate tissues (e.g. adipose tissue and pancreas), which would then generate the seemingly discordant genetic association pattern between WHRadjBMI and T2DadjBMI.</p><p>3. A clear weakness in the study is the lack of any consideration to the subcomponents of the WHR phenotype: waist and hip circumference. As WHR is calculated as the ratio of waist circumference to hip circumference, WHR can increase if waist circumference increases or if hip circumference decreases, reflecting an increase in abdominal fat or a decrease in gluteofemoral fat, respectively. Waist and hip circumferences have very different implications for cardiometabolic health and T2D risk. Thus, is it critical to include an analysis on genetic effects on the two different fat depots, to understand the biological underpinnings of the findings. In addition, further GWAS results could be used to look into more detailed fat distribution phenotypes, such as the amount of visceral fat and subcutaneous fat in different body compartments.</p><p>4. The results show that two of the independent discordant loci (represented by rs3776705 and rs459193), associated with lower risk of T2DadjBMI, show genome-wide significant associations with higher 2-hour glucose levels, and one of the loci (rs459193) also shows a genome-wide significant association with higher fasting glucose levels, despite their protective effect on T2D risk. The findings appear counter-intuitive, considering that T2D is diagnosed based on elevated fasting and 2-hour glucose values. Particularly for these two loci, it would be critical to make sure that the directions of effects and the reported reference alleles are validated in a further set of data, to make sure that the discordant effects are not due to mismatched alleles.</p><p>5. The paper includes several overstated claims about the clinical impact of the findings and use of the findings for personalized risk stratification [e.g. lines 77-78, 259-263].

To increase confidence in effector genes, we performed summary-based randomization (SMR) using T2DadjBMI and WHRadjBMI with QTLs. This provided an orthogonal method for colocalization that infers the causality of QTLs for GWAS associations. To control for false positives associated with MR methods, we implemented a false-discovery rate threshold of 5e-02 and performed a visual inspection of the association signal as visualized by LocusCompare. Implementing a requirement that a single variant that is associated with both the eQTL and trait of interest yielded 20 significant eQTL colocalizations, which have now been reported in Supplementary File 7. Additionally, we updated the table labels in the supplementary files to differentiate between colocalization results achieved using Coloc.abf and using SMR (Supplementary Files 6 &amp; 7).

To increase the interpretability of our analysis, we performed a multi-trait colocalization analysis for each of the loci containing a discordant association signal in the SNP set using the summary statistics for Waist Circumference (WC), Hip Circumference (HC), the ratio of Waist-to-Hip circumference (WHR), Body-Mass Index (BMI), WHR adjusted for BMI (WHRadjBMI), Type 2 Diabetes (T2D), and T2D adjusted for BMI (T2DadjBMI). In this recursive multi-trait colocalization analysis, traits are pairwise analyzed, and then summary statistics from traits are successively added and removed until the highest likelihood is achieved. This is repeated until all the colocalization of genetic association signals for each trait is tested and the maximal number of high-confidence colocalized groups of traits at each locus is achieved. This analysis was able to replicate colocalization at all six discordant loci.

The colocalization analysis with the additional traits is now summarized in Supplementary File 3. The text has been updated to reflect these results (lines 123-127) and the methods (lines 353-358).

Ratios can be problematic per se if two traits have a non-zero intercept (I am not sure if this is the case for WC and HC?), and adjusting for a heritable trait (BMI) may introduce collider bias, as was elegantly shown by Day et al. (https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/26849114/). As a result, an association with WHRadjBMI may not reflect the same biological phenomenon for each locus. Hence, in addition to associations with WHRadjBMI and T2DadjBMI, it would be informative to also show summary statistics for associations of these loci with waist circumference, hip circumference, BMI and T2D in Figure 1.</p></disp-quote><p>We appreciate the comments on the choice of WHRadjBMI as a trait.

By running a co-localization analysis with sets of SNPs within 200kb of a genome-wide significant SNP in either GWAS, the number of truly co-localizing signals may be underestimated due to secondary association signals in either or both GWASs. It could be worthwhile to additionally run conditional analyses for each outcome to identify such loci and run the co-localization analysis for each association signal separately.</p></disp-quote><p>We apologize for the confusion, and the Methods section has been updated to reflect this. SNP windows of 200kb were constructed and then merged with nearby windows to form the loci that underwent colocalization analysis. This was to include all variants in linkage disequilibrium with the lead signal at the locus, as well as to include secondary association signals. To determine if the initial SNP window of 200kb significantly altered results, we altered the initial SNP window to 500kb and did not discover new loci containing discordant association signals, or find that previously identified loci were no longer significant. We amended the text in the Methods (line 327) to reflect this change.</p><p>Additionally, we implemented the sum of single effects (SuSiE) model to relax the single causal variant assumption and parse the effects of potential multiple causal signals at a locus. In conjunction with colocalization analysis, this found a separate discordant association signal in the 5q21.2 locus that was even more strongly associated with genetic regulation than the primary signal identified in our earlier analysis (Figures 1, 2, and 4). We report our results in Supplementary File 3 and throughout the Results section.

Presumably, the association with both traits also needed to be significant?</p></disp-quote><p>This is an excellent point, and our methods section has been updated to clarify this (lines 332 – 341). We additionally added all of the p-values for the association to Supplementary File 1 to further clarify the significance of association within the 99% credible set of SNPs. The association with both traits needed to reach at least a nominal, locus-wide significance of 5e-04. The signals for both WHRadjBMI and T2DadjBMI at four of the five discordant loci reached a genome-wide significance level of 5e-08. At the locus represented by variant rs74567345, the association p-value for WHRadjBMI was 1.599e-05. At the locus represented by the variant rs3786897, the association p-value for T2DadjBMI was 1.6e-07. Because these loci passed visual inspection as well as having significant Bayesian factors (&gt;0.70) we considered them for further analysis. Additionally, while genome-wide significance is traditionally used to prioritize variant candidates for further investigation, work done in the laboratory of Brian W. Parks (PMID: 32197071) demonstrates that even variants with only nominal, local significance in GWAS can also have functional relevance to GWAS traits. We additionally used SuSiE to parse the colocalization of multiple causal signals in loci and found the association signal represented by variant rs6860588 that did reach genome-wide significance for association with both traits, as described in the Methods section and the response to reviewers above.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>4.

We then searched for the presence of variants in our credible set in the “bait” and “prey” regions of chromatin and were unable to discover the presence of discordant variants in the credible set within regions containing significant chromatin-chromatin interactions. While this revealed significant associations in the loci of interest, none of the discordant variants were in “bait” or “prey” regions in any cell line or tissue of interest. In summary, we concluded that chromatin-chromatin interactions are not a significant driver at the QTL colocalizations.

We used Summary-Based Mendelian randomization to prioritize eGenes with a direct association between expression levels and traits of interest. This orthogonal method to Coloc.abf provided us with more significant associations and replicated a limited set from Coloc.abf (Supplementary Files 6 and 7). We considered looking into chromatin accessibility QTLs (caQTLs) in relevant cell types as well, but we were only able to obtain liver caQTL data. Because we did not propose mechanisms of action in the liver for our discordant loci, we decided this would not represent a further prioritization or more association data to support or discredit our hypotheses and did not move forward with this. Nonetheless, we thank the reviewer for this suggestion as this did prompt us to look more critically at publicly available data to support and prioritize our candidate genes. We decided instead to look at time series preadipocyte differentiation data to see if our candidate eGenes played a role in adipogenesis (Figure 3B). This revealed significant associations with dynamic expression across adipogenesis. Because adipogenesis is known to be a significant molecular regulator of adipose tissue distribution, this helped us to prioritize candidate genes and form hypotheses at the 2p21 and 5q21.2 loci.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>9.
