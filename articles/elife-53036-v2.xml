host-virus interaction. We recently reported that HIV-1 Vif is also able to degrade the PPP2R5 family of regulatory subunits of key cellular phosphatase PP2A (PPP2R5A-E; Greenwood et al., 2016; Naamati et al., 2019). We now identify amino acid polymorphisms at positions 31 and 128 of HIV-1 Vif which selectively regulate the degradation of PPP2R5 family proteins. These residues covary across HIV-1 viruses in vivo, favouring depletion of PPP2R5A-E. Through analysis of point mutants and naturally occurring Vif variants, we further show that degradation of PPP2R5 family subunits is both necessary and sufficient for Vif-dependent G2/M cell cycle arrest. Antagonism of PP2A by HIV-1 Vif is therefore independent of APOBEC3 family proteins, and regulates cell cycle progression in HIV-infected cells.</p></abstract><kwd-group kwd-group-type="author-keywords"><kwd>HIV</kwd><kwd>Vif</kwd><kwd>PP2A</kwd><kwd>cell cycle</kwd></kwd-group><kwd-group kwd-group-type="research-organism"><title>Research organism</title><kwd>Virus</kwd></kwd-group><funding-group><award-group id="fund1"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100000265</institution-id><institution>Medical Research Council</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>MR/P008801/1</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Matheson</surname><given-names>Nicholas J</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund2"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100009033</institution-id><institution>NHS Blood and Transplant</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>WPA15-02</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Matheson</surname><given-names>Nicholas J</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund3"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100004440</institution-id><institution>Wellcome</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>210688/Z/18/Z</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Lehner</surname><given-names>Paul J</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><funding-statement>The funders had no role in study design, data collection and interpretation, or the decision to submit the work for publication.</funding-statement></funding-group><custom-meta-group><custom-meta specific-use="meta-only"><meta-name>Author impact statement</meta-name><meta-value>Systematic screen of HIV-1 Vif mutants identifies synthetic and naturally occurring amino acid polymorphisms separating PPP2R5 and APOBEC3 family protein depletion and uncovers the mechanism of Vif-dependent cell cycle arrest.</meta-value></custom-meta></custom-meta-group></article-meta></front><body><sec id="s1" sec-type="intro"><title>Introduction</title><p>The canonical function of HIV-1 Vif is to recruit the cellular restriction factor APOBEC3G for CUL5 E3 ligase and ubiquitin-proteasome-dependent degradation in infected cells, preventing APOBEC3G encapsidation and enhancing virion infectivity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Conticello et al., 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">Kobayashi et al., 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib44">Marin et al., 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib47">Mehle et al., 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib69">Sheehy et al., 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib70">Sheehy et al., 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib74">Stopak et al., 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib87">Yu et al., 2003</xref>). This interaction is very likely to be important in vivo, because the ability of Vif to antagonise APOBEC3G and its homologues is broadly conserved across lentiviral phylogeny, and has driven co-evolution of the mammalian APOBEC3 family (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Compton et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib53">Nakano et al., 2017</xref>).</p><p>The other cell biological phenotype associated with Vif in multiple studies is the induction of G2/M cell cycle arrest (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">DeHart et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Evans et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Izumi et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib67">Sakai et al., 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib78">Wang et al., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib89">Zhao et al., 2015</xref>). Vif-dependent cell cycle arrest does not require expression of APOBEC3 family proteins, but is reliant on lysine-48 ubiquitination and the same CUL5 E3 ligase complex recruited by Vif to deplete APOBEC3G (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">DeHart et al., 2008</xref>). It has therefore been suspected to reflect ubiquitination and degradation of an unknown cellular factor involved in cell cycle progression (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">DeHart et al., 2008</xref>). Why only certain HIV-1 Vif variants mediate this effect (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Evans et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib89">Zhao et al., 2015</xref>), and how widely conserved it is across the lentiviral lineage, have remained unclear.</p><p>We have recently discovered that, in addition to APOBEC3 family proteins, Vif is also able to degrade the B56 family of regulatory subunits of the ubiquitous heterotrimeric serine-threonine phosphatase PP2A (PPP2R5A-E) in HIV-1-infected CEM-T4 T cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Greenwood et al., 2016</xref>) and primary human CD4+ T cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib52">Naamati et al., 2019</xref>). Together with PP1, PP2A is one of the major cellular serine-threonine phosphatases (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib55">Nasa and Kettenbach, 2018</xref>). Specificity of the PP2A holoenzyme is determined by the bound regulatory subunit, and targets of PP2A-B56 have been implicated in a host of cellular processes, including the regulation of mitotic kinases and cell cycle progression (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Foley et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Grallert et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib76">Vallardi et al., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib86">Yang and Phiel, 2010</xref>).</p><p>The ability of Vif to degrade PPP2R5 subunits (illustrated for PPP2R5D in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1A</xref>) is shared by Vif variants from diverse primate and non-primate lentiviruses (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Greenwood et al., 2016</xref>), suggesting a beneficial effect on viral replication in vivo. In theory, however, depletion of PPP2R5A-E could be dependent on or secondary to the phylogenetically conserved ability of Vif to antagonise APOBEC3 family proteins. To demonstrate that these functions are autonomous and have therefore been independently selected, we now screen a library of rationally designed Vif point mutants, and identify amino acid substitutions at residues 31 and 128 which clearly separate APOBEC3 and PPP2R5 family protein depletion. We further show that antagonism of PP2A explains the ability of Vif to cause cell cycle arrest, and that this requires efficient depletion of all PPP2R5 family subunits. Naturally occurring polymorphisms of residues 31 and 128 correlate with the ability of HIV-1 Vif variants to cause cell cycle arrest, and reveal evidence of selection pressure for PPP2R5A-E depletion in vivo.</p><fig-group><fig id="fig1" position="float"><label>Figure 1.</label><caption><title>Flow cytometric screen of HIV-1 Vif point mutants.</title><p>(<bold>A</bold>) Depletion of endogenous PPP2R5D by HIV-1 Vif.

In the right panel (same phylogenetic tree), viruses are coloured according to clade (as indicated).</p></caption><graphic mime-subtype="tiff" mimetype="image" xlink:href="elife-53036-fig7-figsupp4-v2.tif"/></fig></fig-group><p>In this experiment, we identified 6297 proteins (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="fig7sdata1">Figure 7—source data 1</xref>), including 4 out of 5 PPP2R5 family subunits (A/C/D/E) but only 1 out of 7 APOBEC3 family member (C). As expected, ΔVpr-Vif WT virus (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7B</xref>, left panel) but not ΔVpr-ΔVif virus (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7B</xref>, middle panel) was able to deplete both APOBEC3C and PPP2R5 family proteins. Conversely, ΔVpr-Vif AYR virus (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7B</xref>, right panel) retained the ability to deplete APOBEC3C, but was completely inactive against PPP2R5 family proteins. As a control, the Nef and Vpu target CD4 was similarly downregulated by each virus (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Guy et al., 1987</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib82">Willey et al., 1992</xref>). To confirm a functional effect on PP2A, we then used these viruses to infect CEM-T4 T cells, and measured their effect on cell cycle progression. Again, only ΔVpr-Vif WT virus, but not ΔVpr-ΔVif or ΔVpr-Vif AYR viruses, was able to induce G2/M cell cycle arrest (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7C</xref>). A similar effect was observed in HIV-infected primary human CD4+ T cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7s2">Figure 7—figure supplement 2A–B</xref>).</p><p>If the ability of Vif to antagonise PP2A is maintained by selection pressure in vivo, combinations of unfavourable (less active against PPP2R5A-E) mutations in residues 31 and 128 (abolishing all PPP2R5 family subunit depletion) should be rare amongst naturally occurring HIV-1 Vif variants. Furthermore, if effects on viral fitness are synergistic, such combinations should occur less frequently than predicted by chance. We therefore examined covariance of polymorphisms of residues 31 and 128 across the clade B HIV-1 Vif sequences available from the Los Alamos National Laboratory Web Alignments database (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7D</xref>; same 2171 sequences as <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5A</xref>).</p><p>Amongst these sequences, 21.8% encode 31V (less active) and 33.6% encode R128 (less active). By chance, combinations of 31V and 128R would therefore be expected in 7.3% of sequences. Conversely, this combination is observed in only 5.8% of sequences. Whist this difference appears modest, the association between these polymorphisms is highly statistically significant (p=0.0003, Fisher’s exact test, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7s3">Figure 7—figure supplement 3A</xref>, left panel). We observed similar, significant under-representation when we limited our analysis to clade B viruses encoding combinations of 31I/V and 128I/R (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7s3">Figure 7—figure supplement 3A</xref>, right panel), or extended it to include Vif sequences from all (any clade, including B) non-recombinant HIV-1 M group viruses (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7s3">Figure 7—figure supplement 3B–C</xref>; same 3412 sequences as <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5s1">Figure 5—figure supplement 1</xref>).</p><p>To distinguish functional covariance of these residues from background linkage disequilibrium (co-inheritance of polymorphisms from a common ancestor), we constructed phylogenetic trees of all Vif variants based on Vif (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7E</xref>) or Nef, Gag or Env (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7s4">Figure 7—figure supplement 4A</xref>). Regardless of the viral protein used, viruses encoding different combinations of 31/128 polymorphisms were scattered throughout the phylogeny, with no obvious founder effect. Again, similar results were seen when we extended our analysis to include Vif sequences from all (any clade, including B) non-recombinant HIV-1 M group viruses (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7s4">Figure 7—figure supplement 4B</xref>).</p><p>Taken together, these data therefore provide evidence of a functional interaction between residues 31/128, and suggest significant in vivo selection pressure to maintain the ability of Vif to antagonise PP2A.</p></sec></sec><sec id="s3" sec-type="discussion"><title>Discussion</title><p>The study of cellular proteins and processes targeted by HIV has provided critical insights into the host-virus interaction. Typically, these targets have been identified piecemeal, using candidate approaches. In contrast, we have recently adopted unbiased proteomic approaches to identify novel substrates of HIV accessory proteins (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Greenwood et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Greenwood et al., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib46">Matheson et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib52">Naamati et al., 2019</xref>). A key challenge is now to determine the biological significance of these targets for HIV-infected cells: both <italic>whether</italic> they are important, and <italic>why</italic> they are important.</p><p>In this study, we sought to address these questions for Vif targets PPP2R5A-E. By demonstrating that depletion of PPP2R5 family subunits by Vif is separable from targeting of APOBEC3 family proteins, we formally prove that PP2A antagonism is neither required for, nor an epiphenomenon of, APOBEC3 family protein depletion. Combined with evidence of conservation across HIV-1 viruses and the broader lentiviral lineage (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Greenwood et al., 2016</xref>), these observations provide strong genetic evidence for the importance of PPP2R5 depletion by Vif in vivo.</p><p>Strikingly, the critical residues for PPP2R5 depletion identified in our screen included several previously determined to be important for Vif-dependent cell cycle arrest in other, independent studies (31, 33, 44) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">DeHart et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib89">Zhao et al., 2015</xref>). As well as residues required for CUL5 complex assembly (114 and 145), several additional residues (14, 36, 48 and 40) were implicated in the same studies. Amongst these, a K36A point mutant showed an intermediate effect on PPP2R5B depletion in our screen (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s2">Figure 1—figure supplement 2A</xref>). The other residues were not tested, because we focussed on regions of Vif not known to be important for depletion of APOBEC3 family proteins, and residues with solvent-exposed side chains unlikely to lead to structural disruption.</p><p>We were initially puzzled because some Vif point mutants were markedly impaired in their ability to cause cell cycle arrest, yet retained the ability to deplete at least some PPP2R5 family subunits. Furthermore, the ability of Vif to cause cell cycle arrest did not appear to correlate with depletion of any one, specific PPP2R5 subunit. In fact, because efficient depletion of all PPP2R5 subunits is required to halt cell cycle progression, these are not paradoxes at all. This same model also suggests explanations for two related phenomena.</p><p>First, expression of HIV-1 Vif in mouse or COS cells results in depletion of PPP2R5D, but does not cause cell cycle arrest (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Evans et al., 2018</xref>). As with Vif point mutants and naturally occurring variants in human cells, it seems likely that another PPP2R5 subunit escapes depletion in these species-mismatched cells. Second, we previously found the ability of Vif to antagonise at least some PPP2R5 subunits to be widely conserved (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Greenwood et al., 2016</xref>), but the ability to cause cell cycle arrest is variable amongst HIV-1 Vif variants (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Evans et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib89">Zhao et al., 2015</xref>). Since efficient depletion of all expressed PPP2R5 subunits is required to cause cell cycle arrest, escape of even a single subunit allows cell cycle to progress.</p><p>Amongst all HIV-1 Vif sequences analysed here, the commonest single combination of residues at positions 31 and 128 was 31I/128I, accounting for approximately 30% of Vif variants. Most of these sequences also encode 33R or 33K and, like NL4-3 and CH470 Vif, are therefore expected to efficiently degrade PPP2R5A-E, and cause cell cycle arrest. Conversely, only approximately 5% encode 31V/128R, and are therefore expected to be severely impaired for PPP2R5A-E degradation. It is likely that most of the remaining Vif variants, like YU2 and HXB2, are active against at least some PPP2R5 family members, but may be variably attenuated in their ability to cause cell cycle arrest. Interestingly, naturally occurring Vif variants have also been shown to exhibit a spectrum of activity against APOBEC3 family proteins, including variants which fail to neutralise one or more APOBEC3 family proteins (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Binka et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">Iwabu et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib51">Mulder et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib73">Simon et al., 2005</xref>).</p><p>Mechanistically, hyperphosphorylation of aurora kinase substrates is expected to contribute significantly to Vif-dependent cell cycle arrest (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Foley et al., 2011</xref>). Nonetheless, PP2A is a ‘master regulator’ of cell cycle (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib83">Wlodarchak and Xing, 2016</xref>), and depletion of PPP2R5A-E by Vif causes widespread remodelling of the phosphoproteome, implying activation of multiple kinases (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Greenwood et al., 2016</xref>). Consistent with this, Vif-dependent cell cycle arrest was previously shown to require TP53 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Izumi et al., 2010</xref>), and several studies have identified upstream regulation of TP53 by PP2A in different systems (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Ajay et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib41">Li et al., 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib86">Yang and Phiel, 2010</xref>).</p><p>Many RNA and DNA viruses cause and are thought to benefit from cell cycle arrest (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Bagga and Bouchard, 2014</xref>). In HIV infection, G2/M cell cycle arrest was first attributed to Vpr (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">He et al., 1995</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">Jowett et al., 1995</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib65">Rogel et al., 1995</xref>), which remains better known for this function. Early studies suggested a positive effect of G2/M arrest on transcription from the HIV-1 LTR (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Goh et al., 1998</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Gummuluru and Emerman, 1999</xref>), but more recent results have raised the possibility that cell cycle arrest may be secondary to another Vpr-dependent process, such as antagonism of innate immunity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">Laguette et al., 2014</xref>). Nonetheless, targeting of the same cell biological process by multiple viral accessory proteins is strong a priori evidence of biological importance in vivo.</p><p>Functional redundancy with Vpr may also help explain why Vif-dependent cell cycle arrest is not more strictly conserved across naturally occurring HIV-1 Vif variants. In addition, key polymorphic residues which regulate PPP2R5 antagonism may be subject to balancing selection pressures. First, the requirement to maintain the Exonic Splicing Silencer of Vpr (ESSV) at the RNA level limits the sequence variability tolerated at position 128 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib43">Madsen and Stoltzfus, 2005</xref>). Second, polymorphisms at position 31 also regulate antagonism of APOBEC3H (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib89">Zhao et al., 2015</xref>). Indeed, at least in some cases, the abilities of Vif to antagonise APOBEC3H and cause cell cycle arrest were found to be mutually exclusive.</p><p>Vif-dependent cell cycle arrest correlates with viral cytopathicity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Evans et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib67">Sakai et al., 2006</xref>), and was reported to enhance HIV-1 replication in vitro in a previous study using chimeric HXB2/NL4-3 Vif variants (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Izumi et al., 2010</xref>). Classic experiments comparing WT and Vif-deficient viruses in permissive cells often examined HXB2 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Gabuzda et al., 1992</xref>) or YU2 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Gaddis et al., 2003</xref>) viruses. Since these Vif variants are shown here to be attenuated in their activity against different PPP2R5 subunits, manifested by a reduced ability to cause cell cycle arrest, it is likely that these studies failed to fully capture the effects of PP2A antagonism on viral infection.</p><p>As importantly, the ability to assess APOBEC3-independent effects of Vif on viral fitness in vitro has hitherto been limited to comparisons between WT and Vif-deficient viruses on an APOBEC3-negative background, such as the CEM-SS cell line. In contrast, the point mutants identified in this study maintain the ability to antagonise APOBEC3 family proteins, and will therefore allow the assessment of Vif-dependent PP2A antagonism by the community in a full range of cell types, including primary and myeloid cells, as well as providing a mechanistic framework to interpret the results.</p></sec><sec id="s4"

The following server options were selected: Alignment type, Web (all complete sequences); Organism, HIV-1/SIVcpz; Subtype, M group without recombinants (A-K); DNA/Protein, protein; Year, 2018; Format, FASTA.</p><p>These alignments contain all non-recombinant HIV-1 M group sequences from the Los Alamos HIV Sequence Database, with the following exceptions: only one sequence per patient is included; a single representative is included of very similar sequences; and sequences unlikely to represent naturally-occurring, viable viruses are excluded. We further subdivided the sequences according to viral clade (subtype) using the information in the sequence name for example <underline>B</underline>.FR.83.HXB2 is assigned to clade <underline>B</underline>. Analyses were conducted for both clade B viruses and all non-recombinant HIV-1 M group viruses.</p><p>To examine amino acid polymorphism in naturally occurring Vif variants at positions corresponding to residues 31, 33/34 and 128 of NL4-3 Vif, sequence logos were generated using WebLogo (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Crooks et al., 2004</xref>). Further data analysis was conducted in R v.3.6.1 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib61">R Development Core Team, 2019</xref>). In brief, residues at each position of interest were extracted using the seqinr R package (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Charif and Lobry, 2007</xref>), then frequencies were calculated and graphical summaries generated using the ggplot R package (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib81">Wickham, 2009</xref>). To identify covariance (non-random association) between polymorphisms at positions 31 and 128, 2 × 2 contingency tables comparing frequencies of key residue pairs were constructed, then subjected to two-tailed Fisher’s exact tests of independence (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib80">Wang and Lee, 2007</xref>).</p><p>To construct phylogenetic trees, only viruses with protein sequences available for all of Vif, Env, Gag and Nef were included. This enabled direct comparison of trees based on different viral proteins. Multiple sequence alignments and phylogenetic tree data (in Newick format) for each viral protein were generated using the Clustal Omega web server (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib71">Sievers and Higgins, 2014</xref>), then visualised using the ggtree R package (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib88">Yu et al., 2018</xref>).</p><p>All alignment and sequence files, scripts and details of the bioinformatic analyses described here are available at: <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://github.com/annaprotasio/Marelli_et_al_HIV_Vif">https://github.com/annaprotasio/Marelli_et_al_HIV_Vif</ext-link> (copy archived at <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://github.com/elifesciences-publications/Marelli_et_al_HIV_Vif">https://github.com/elifesciences-publications/Marelli_et_al_HIV_Vif</ext-link>).</p></sec><sec id="s4-19"><title>General statistical analysis</title><p>Where indicated, Student’s <italic>t</italic>-tests (unpaired two-sample, assuming homoscedasticity, two-tailed), Fisher’s exact tests (two-tailed) and 95% confidence intervals were calculated using Prism 7.0 (GraphPad).

Your article has been reviewed by two peer reviewers, and the evaluation has been overseen by Frank Kirchhoff as the Reviewing Editor and Päivi Ojala as the Senior Editor. The following individual involved in review of your submission have agreed to reveal their identity: Linda Chelico (Reviewer #1).</p><p>The reviewers have discussed the reviews with one another and the Reviewing Editor has drafted this decision to help you prepare a revised submission.</p><p>Summary:</p><p>In the present study, Matheson, Lehner and coworkers followed up on their previous work showing that, in addition to inducing degradation of APOBEC3G, Vif also triggers the proteasomal degradation of all PPP2R5 family regulatory subunits of the host phosphatase PP2A. Here, they identified mutations in Vif separating these activities and provide evidence that the degradation of PPP2R5 family members accounts for the cell cycle arrest caused by certain Vif proteins. They also show that efficient depletion of all PPP2R5 subunits seems required for the Vif-dependent cell cycle arrest, providing an explanation for why HIV-1 Vif variants that antagonize some but not all PPP2R5 subunits do not cause cell cycle arrest.</p><p>The study addresses an important issue and for most part the data are clearly presented and convincing. Limitations are that the significance of this Vif activity for HIV-1 replication in primary cells and in vivo remain elusive although the authors provide some evidence for selective pressure to maintain this Vif function. Altogether, the findings provide relevant insights into the molecular biology of HIV-1 but as outlined below some additional experiments should be performed to further increase its significance.</p><p>Essential revisions:</p><p>1) Figure 1 and Vif mutants. An immunoblot of the Vif mutants would assist in determining their stabilities by observing steady state levels. Later in manuscript there appears to be some differences in Vif mutant stabilities that should be addressed directly in Figure 1, rather than citing that they are not predicted to interfere with stability.</p><p>2) In Figure 1, only APOBEC3G is used as a control, but since Vif binds APOBEC3F and APOBEC3H in different regions, it would be more convincing if all 3 APOBECs were used to determine the extent of overlap. This is partially addressed in later figures and so showing the data in Figure 1 for the 3 main APOBEC3s that have anti-HIV activity would make the later data, which shows some overlap in activity for some APOBEC3s, less contradictory to this figure.</p><p>3) The rationale for the cutoff of different amino acids in Figure 1C is not clear; why was R15A not chosen? Why is only PPP2R5B examined by flow cytometry in Figure 1C when PPP2R5D is shown in immunoblots in Figure 1A and Figure 2A? Figure needs to be more consistent or have consistent reasoning for data shown.</p><p>4) Figure 4: Conclusion that all PPP2R5B subunits are required; yet HeLa cells don't express the PPP2R5B subunit (that was previously shown as important/most conserved function and is highlighted in Figure 1B). Can the authors transfect PPP2R5B to supplement the HeLa cells to confirm that all subunits need to be degraded to see effect? PPP2R5B is used as the major example in all the mechanistic data; but lacks the key functional evidence. In supplementary figure for Figure 4, there is more PPP2R5B level than the other PPP2R5s, yet authors state that the mRNA is low to not detectable by qRT-PCR. The levels and importance of PPP2R5B needs to be better tested/presented. Especially since a recent article, Salamango et al., Cell Reports, 2019 implicates only PPP2R5A, C, and D in cell cycle arrest.</p></body></sub-article><sub-article article-type="reply" id="sa2"><front-stub><article-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.53036.sa2</article-id><title-group><article-title>Author response</article-title></title-group></front-stub><body><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Essential revisions:</p><p>1) Figure 1 and Vif mutants.

A functional test of Vif stability was therefore built into the screen i.e. “stable enough to deplete APOBEC3G”.</p><p>This is important, because it is a direct test of the biologically relevant endpoint, controls for changes in recruitment of the CUL5 E3 ligase complex as well as steady state Vif levels, and avoids potential confounding by changes to anti-Vif antibody binding affinity caused by the point mutations. We make this point in the text.</p><p>Results:</p><p>“As well as indicating preserved APOBEC3 family substrate recruitment, the ability to deplete APOBEC3G served as a control for unanticipated effects on Vif expression or stability, or assembly of the Vif-CUL5 complex.”</p><p>We would like to take the opportunity to emphasise that, we have not observed any differences in Vif stability for the critical Vif I31 and I128 mutants which form the focus of this manuscript, based on either immunoblot or proteomic measurements of steady state levels, or flow cytometric or proteomic assays of APOBEC3 family depletion.</p><p>Conversely, as described in the Results and illustrated in Figure 2, mutations in R33/K34 were typically associated with somewhat lower Vif levels in CEM-T4s, accompanied by partial loss of activity against APOBEC3 family members, particularly APOBEC3F. This is why we chose to focus instead on residues 31 and 128.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>2) In Figure 1, only APOBEC3G is used as a control, but since Vif binds APOBEC3F and APOBEC3H in different regions, it would be more convincing if all 3 APOBECs were used to determine the extent of overlap.

In summary, APOBEC3F depletion by the Vif mutants we found to be defective for PPP2R5B (highlighted in Figure 1C) was preserved, with the exception of the R15A mutant (as previously reported) and the RK33/34AA mutant.</p><p>Results:</p><p>“First, we tested the ability of Vif mutants lacking the ability to deplete PPP2R5B to deplete HA-tagged APOBEC3F in 293Ts, similar to our initial flow cytometry screen (Figure 1—figure supplement 4A-C). As previously reported (Letko et al., 2015; Nakashima et al., 2016), mutation of R15 resulted in loss of activity against APOBEC3F. The RK33/34AA mutant was also partially impaired, but other mutants retained full activity against APOBEC3F.”</p><p>Please note that, these results concord precisely with our proteomic data (shown in Figure 2D). In fact, a major strength of our study is the use of a functional proteomic approach to assess Vif activity against endogenous APOBEC3 and PPP2R5 family members in T cells, avoiding the possibility of over-expression artefacts, or the need for protein tags.</p><p>Since APOBEC3F was not quantitated in our second proteomic experiment (shown in Figure 6A-C), however, we took the opportunity to use the APOBEC3F flow cytometric screen to formally test the activity of our critical “Vif AYR” double mutant (combined I31/I128 mutations). This data is now included in an expanded figure supplement (Figure 6—figure supplement 3A-B, lower panels), and we have altered the main text accordingly. In summary, and as predicted, Vif AYR retained activity against APOBEC3F.</p><p>Results:</p><p>“Since PPP2R5B and APOBEC3F were not quantitated in the proteomic experiment, we tested the ability of Vif AYR to deplete these subunits by flow cytometry in 293Ts, including APOBE3G as a control (Figure 6—figure supplement 3A-B). As expected, Vif AYR was able to deplete APOBEC3F and APOBEC3G but not PPP2R5B, and failed to cause cell cycle arrest (Figure 6D).”</p><p>Please also note that, we did not screen against APOBEC3H haplotype II, because wildtype NL4-3 Vif (on which our mutant library was based) is known to be unable to deplete this APOBEC3 family member. For clarity, we now include a better overview of the AOBEC3 family, and explicitly make this point in the main text.</p><p>Results:</p><p>“As well as APOBEC3G, other APOBEC3 family members (such as APOBEC3F and APOBEC3H haplotype II) are also able to restrict HIV replication (Feng et al., 2014), and Vif recruits different APOBEC3 family members for degradation using distinct binding surfaces (Binka et al., 2012b; Chen et al., 2009; Dang et al., 2009; Gaddis et al., 2003; Harris and Anderson, 2016; He et al., 2008; Letko et al., 2015; Mehle et al., 2007; Nakashima et al., 2016; Ooms et al., 2016; Richards et al., 2015; Russell and Pathak, 2007; Simon et al., 2005a; Yamashita et al., 2008).”</p><p>Results:</p><p>“APOBEC3H haplotype II was not examined, because wildtype NL4-3 Vif (on which our Vif mutant library was based) is unable to deplete this APOBEC3 family member (Binka et al., 2012a; Ooms et al., 2013; Zhao et al., 2015).”</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>3) The rationale for the cutoff of different amino acids in Figure 1C is not clear; why was R15A not chosen? Why is only PPP2R5B examined by flow cytometry in Figure 1C when PPP2R5D is shown in immunoblots in Figure 1A and Figure 2A? Figure needs to be more consistent or have consistent reasoning for data shown.</p></disp-quote><p>Thank you for the comment/questions, we are sorry that these points were not clear to the reviewer. In brief: first, we did not evaluate the R15A mutant further because it was already known to be defective for APOBEC3F depletion (now confirmed here in Figure 1—figure supplement 4), and we were seeking Vif mutants which lacked the ability to deplete PPP2R5 family subunits, but retained the ability to deplete APOBEC3 family members.</p><p>Second, we chose PPP2R5B as a representative PPP2R5 subunit for our flow cytometric screen because we had previously shown that, amongst the PPP2R5 family subunits, depletion of PPP25B was most conserved across Vif variants from different primate lentiviruses.</p><p>Third, we chose PPP2R5D as a representative PPP2R5 subunit for our immunoblots because, to our knowledge, no validated PPP2R5B antibody is available, and, amongst the other PPP2R5 family subunits, this is (in our experience) the most reliable antibody reagent.</p><p>To ensure that our reasoning is clear, we have reviewed and in some cases rewritten the main text to emphasise the overall strategy, and explicitly address these points.</p><p>Results:</p><p>“We discovered several Vif mutants to be defective for PPP2R5B depletion (Figure 1C). Vif protein expression levels were similar (Figure 1—figure supplement 3), but some mutations affected residues already known to be required for depletion of APOBEC3G (K26, Y44, W70) (Letko et al., 2015) or APOBEC3C/F (R15) (Letko et al., 2015; Nakashima et al., 2016) (Figure 1D and Figure 1—figure supplement 2C). Conversely, Vif variants with mutations in residues Y30/I31, R33/K34 and I128 were defective for PPP2R5B depletion, retained the ability to antagonise APOBEC3G, and had not been implicated in APOBEC3C/F depletion. These residues are grouped in three similarly orientated patches on the Vif surface (Figure 1B, residues highlighted in red). Aiming to identify Vif variants specifically defective for PPP2R5 subunit depletion, we therefore focused on mutations in residues I128, I31 and R33/K34 for further evaluation, including representatives from each patch.”</p><p>Results:</p><p>“Amongst the five PPP2R5 family subunits, we previously showed that depletion of PPP2R5B is most conserved across Vif variants from HIV-1/2 and the non-human primate lentiviruses (Greenwood et al., 2016). We therefore transfected our library into HEK 293T cells (293Ts) stably expressing HA-tagged PPP2R5B or APOBEC3G, and used flow cytometry to quantify PPP2R5B and APOBEC3G depletion by each Vif variant…”</p><p>Results:</p><p>“Levels of an indicative PPP2R5 subunit for which a reliable antibody is available (PPP2R5D, as in Figure 1A) were then measured by immunoblot (Figure 2A).”</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>4) Figure 4: Conclusion that all PPP2R5B subunits are required; yet HeLa cells don't express the PPP2R5B subunit (that was previously shown as important/most conserved function and is highlighted in Figure 1B). Can the authors transfect PPP2R5B to supplement the HeLa cells to confirm that all subunits need to be degraded to see effect? PPP2R5B is used as the major example in all the mechanistic data; but lacks the key functional evidence. In supplementary figure for Figure 4, there is more PPP2R5B level than the other PPP2R5s, yet authors state that the mRNA is low to not detectable by qRT-PCR. The levels and importance of PPP2R5B needs to be better tested/presented. Especially since a recent article, Salamango et al., Cell Reports, 2019 implicates only PPP2R5A, C, and D in cell cycle arrest.</p></disp-quote><p>Thank you for the suggestions, we have included the requested PPP2R5B over-expression and qRT-PCR experiments as an additional figure supplement (Figure 4—figure supplement 2), added a further figure supplement examining Vif-dependent cell cycle arrest in primary human CD4<sup>+</sup> T cells (Figure 7—figure supplement 2), and altered the main text accordingly. These revisions are described in more detail below.</p><p>First, to control for PCR efficiency and allow formal comparison of abundances between different PPP2R5 subunits, we have repeated all our qRT-PCR data using standard curves generated from plasmids encoding PPP2R5A-E and TBP. Copies of mRNA (normalised to TBP) for PPP2R5A-E in CEM-T4s and HeLas are now shown in Figure 4—figure supplement 2A. In summary, these data confirm that expression of PPP2R5B is detectable in both cell types, but lower than other PPP2R5 subunits, particularly in HeLas.</p><p>Results:</p><p>“First, we confirmed that, as in CEM-T4s, expression of WT NL4-3 Vif in HeLas causes cell cycle arrest (Figure 4—figure supplement 1B). Likewise, mRNA expression levels of individual PPP2R5 subunits were determined by quantitative real-time PCR (qRT-PCR), and found to be similar between cell types, with PPP2R5B much lower than other subunits (Figure 4—figure supplement 2A).”</p><p>Please note that, we have also repeated our qRT-PCR test of siRNA knockdown efficiency for each subunit, using the same method (Figure 4—figure supplement 2B). In this figure, relative mRNA abundance for each subunit is shown for siRNA-transfected vs control cells. Because expression of PPP2R5B in wildtype cells is lower than other subunits, expression falls below the linear range of the assay in cells transfected with siRNA.</p><p>Second, we over-expressed PPP2R5B in HeLas, resulting in elevated PPP2R5B mRNA levels comparable to other subunits (Figure 4—figure supplement 2C). As predicted by the reviewer, supplementation with PPP2R5B rescued cell cycle progression in the presence of PPP2R5A, C, D and E depletion by siRNA (Figure 4—figure supplement 2C-E).</p><p>Results:</p><p>“That depletion of PPP2R5B is neither sufficient (Figure 4A-B) nor required (Figure 4C-D) in this setting may reflect low expression of PPP2R5B (Figure 4—figure supplement 2A), consistent with previous protein-level data from HeLas (Geiger et al., 2012). To test this hypothesis, we generated HeLa cells expressing exogenous PPP2R5B at similar levels to other PPP2R5 subunits (Figure 4—figure supplement 2C). As predicted, transfection of a pool of siRNA targeting PPP2R5A, C D and E (but not B) caused cell cycle arrest in wildtype HeLas, but not HeLas over-expressing PPP2R5B (Figure 4—figure supplement 2D-E, compare with Figure 4C-D).”</p><p>Please also note the reasons described above for focussing on PPP2R5B as a representative PPP2R5 subunit for our flow cytometric screen. In fact, our data suggest that efficient depletion of all PPP2R5 subunits is required to cause cell cycle arrest. Critically, this explains why Vif variants with impaired activity against any PPP2R5 subunit (rather than one particular PPP2R5 subunit) are defective for this phenotype (compare the differential effects of Vif variants with mutations in I31 and I128 shown in Figure 2C). We elaborate on this in our Discussion (paragraph three).</p><p>Finally, to confirm that the effects we describe in CEM-T4s and HeLas are relevant to HIV-1 infection of primary human CD4<sup>+</sup> T cells, we infected cells from 2 donors with WT, ΔVif or Vif AYR viruses (on a ΔVpr background), and confirmed that the combined I31/I128 mutations in Vif AYR did indeed abolish Vif-dependent cell cycle arrest (Figure 7—figure supplement 2).</p><p>Results:</p><p>“To confirm a functional effect on PP2A, we then used these viruses to infect CEM-T4 T cells, and measured their effect on cell cycle progression. Again, only ΔVpr-Vif WT virus, but not ΔVpr-ΔVif or ΔVpr-Vif AYR viruses, was able to induce G2/M cell cycle arrest (Figure 7C). A similar effect was observed in HIV-infected primary human CD4<sup>+</sup> T cells (Figure 7—figure supplement 2A-B).”</p></body></sub-article></article>
