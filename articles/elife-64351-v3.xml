peptide (AgRP)-expressing neurons are crucial for the regulation of whole-body energy homeostasis. Here, we show that fasting-induced AgRP neuronal activation is associated with dynamin-related peptide 1 (DRP1)-mediated mitochondrial fission and mitochondrial fatty acid utilization in AgRP neurons. In line with this, mice lacking <italic>Dnm1l</italic> in adult AgRP neurons (Drp1 cKO) show decreased fasting- or ghrelin-induced AgRP neuronal activity and feeding and exhibited a significant decrease in body weight, fat mass, and feeding accompanied by a significant increase in energy expenditure. In support of the role for mitochondrial fission and fatty acids oxidation, Drp1 cKO mice showed attenuated palmitic acid-induced mitochondrial respiration. Altogether, our data revealed that mitochondrial dynamics and fatty acids oxidation in hypothalamic AgRP neurons is a critical mechanism for AgRP neuronal function and body-weight regulation.</p></abstract><kwd-group kwd-group-type="author-keywords"><kwd>AgRP</kwd><kwd>feeding</kwd><kwd>metabolism</kwd><kwd>mitochondria</kwd></kwd-group><kwd-group kwd-group-type="research-organism"><title>Research organism</title><kwd>Mouse</kwd></kwd-group><funding-group><award-group id="fund1"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000062</institution-id><institution>National Institute of Diabetes and Digestive and Kidney Diseases</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>DK097566</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Diano</surname><given-names>Sabrina</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund2"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000062</institution-id><institution>National Institute of Diabetes and Digestive and Kidney Diseases</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>DK107293</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Diano</surname><given-names>Sabrina</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund3"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000062</institution-id><institution>National Institute of Diabetes and Digestive and Kidney Diseases</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>DK120321</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Diano</surname><given-names>Sabrina</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund4"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000002</institution-id><institution>National Institutes of Health</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>NIH R01 AG052005</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Horvath</surname><given-names>Tamas L</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund5"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000002</institution-id><institution>National Institutes of Health</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>NIH R01 DK126447</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Horvath</surname><given-names>Tamas L</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><funding-statement>The funders had no role in study design, data collection and interpretation, or the decision to submit the work for publication.</funding-statement></funding-group><custom-meta-group><custom-meta specific-use="meta-only"><meta-name>Author impact statement</meta-name><meta-value>Mitochondrial fission, associated with fatty acids oxidation, is fundamental for AgRP neuronal activity during negative energy balance and in regulating fasting- and/or ghrelin-induced feeding.</meta-value></custom-meta></custom-meta-group></article-meta></front><body><sec sec-type="intro" id="s1"><title>Introduction</title><p>The central nervous system (CNS) regulates whole-body energy metabolism through multiple neuronal networks (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Diano, 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Myers and Olson, 2012</xref>). The hypothalamus has been considered a key area of the brain in regulating metabolism via the ability of hypothalamic neurons to sense, integrate, and respond to fluctuating metabolic signals (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Coll and Yeo, 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Sandoval et al., 2009</xref>). The hypothalamic arcuate nucleus (ARC) contains two distinct neuronal subpopulations that produce either orexigenic neuropeptides agouti-related peptide (AgRP) and neuropeptide-Y (NPY), or anorexigenic neuropeptides including alpha-melanocyte stimulating hormone (Î±-MSH) derived from proopiomelanocortin (POMC) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Batterham et al., 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Ollmann et al., 1997</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Roh et al., 2016</xref>). The anatomical location of the hypothalamic ARC allows these neurons to rapidly respond to fluctuations of numerous circulating metabolic signals, including nutrients and hormones (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Gao and Horvath, 2007</xref>). However, the intracellular mechanisms underlying their ability to sense circulating signals, and, specifically nutrients, remain to be elucidated.</p><p>Mitochondria are the main powerhouse of the cell by producing adenosine triphosphate (ATP) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Mattson et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Picard et al., 2016</xref>). Neurons rely on mitochondrial electron transport chain and oxidative phosphorylation to meet their high energy demands (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">BÃ©langer et al., 2011</xref>). In addition, mitochondria are highly dynamic organelles able to change their morphology and location according to the needs of the cell (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Chan, 2006</xref>). The ability of mitochondria to change their morphological characteristics in response to the metabolic state to match with the needs of the cells occurs through fusion and fission events, process defined as mitochondrial dynamics. Mitochondrial morphological changes are associated with several proteins, including mitofusin 1 and 2 (MFN1 and MFN2) in the mitochondrial outer membrane and optic atrophy-1 (OPA1) in the mitochondrial inner membrane for mitochondrial fusion (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Kasahara and Scorrano, 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">Youle and van der Bliek, 2012</xref>), whereas mitochondrial fission is regulated by the activity of the dynamin-related protein 1 (DRP1, a mechanochemical protein encoded by the <italic>Dnm1l</italic> gene), which is recruited to the mitochondrial outer membrane to interact with mitochondrial fission factor (Mff) and mitochondrial fission 1 (Fis1) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">LosÃ³n et al., 2013</xref>).</p><p>Previous studies from our laboratory have shown that NPY/AgRP neuronal activation is associated with changes in mitochondrial morphology and density during fasting or after ghrelin administration (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Andrews et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Coppola et al., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Dietrich et al., 2013</xref>), suggesting that changes in mitochondrial dynamics play a role in the regulation of neuronal activation of these neurons (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Nasrallah and Horvath, 2014</xref>). In addition, we found that high-fat-diet-induced inactivation of NPY/AgRP neurons is associated with mitochondrial dynamics leaning towards mitochondrial fusion in this neuronal population (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Dietrich et al., 2013</xref>).

First, we found that activated AgRP neurons have decreased mitochondrial size accompanied by an increase in mitochondria number suggesting a mitochondrial fission process. In agreement with this, we found that <italic>Dnm1l</italic> mRNA levels and DRP1 activation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Liesa et al., 2009</xref>) are significantly increased in AgRP neurons of fasted mice compared to fed mice. These data were associated with a significant increase in FA-induced mitochondrial respiration in primary hypothalamic neuronal cells when low glucose levels (similar to fasting) were present compared to higher glucose levels. To determine the physiological relevance of mitochondrial fission in AgRP neurons, we generated a mouse model for conditional deletion of <italic>Dnm1l</italic> in AgRP neurons (Drp1 cKO mice). We found that Drp1 cKO mice, in which fasting did not induce mitochondrial fission and changes in mitochondrial function, had significant decreases in body weight, composition, and feeding that were accompanied by increases in locomotion and energy expenditure. Finally, Drp1 cKO mice also showed attenuated ghrelin-induced hyperphagia and neuronal activity of AgRP neurons. Altogether, these data revealed that DRP1-driven mitochondrial fission in AgRP neurons is an adaptive process enabling these neurons to respond to the changing metabolic environment.</p><p>Mitochondria are energy-producing organelles fundamental in support of cellular functions. Mitochondria are highly dynamic organelles able not only to move within the cell to sites where their function is required, but also to fuse (mitochondrial fusion) and divide (mitochondrial fission) in order to maintain proper cellular function.</p><p>Mitochondrial fusion and fission are highly regulated processes. Several proteins are involved in these events, including MFN1 and MFN2 and OPA1 for mitochondrial fusion, and Fis1, Mff, and DRP1 for mitochondrial fission (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Pozo Devoto and Falzone, 2017</xref>). Mitochondrial dynamics through fusion and fission processes are also important in maintaining mitochondrial quality control in order to maintain optimal mitochondrial bioenergetic functions (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">Twig et al., 2008</xref>). Our data indicate that mitochondrial dynamics and specifically mitochondrial fission play an important role in sensing changes of nutrients availability in AgRP neurons. First, we observed that incubation of primary hypothalamic neurons with palmitic acid induced a significant increase in mitochondrial respiration when glucose levels were low, mimicking fasting. Fasting induced increased AgRP neuronal activation and increased mitochondrial fission. However, when DRP1-induced mitochondrial fission in AgRP neurons was abolished, palmitic acid-induced mitochondrial respiration was diminished. In association with these, ghrelin-triggered changes in membrane potential and firing frequency of AgRP neurons were significantly attenuated in Drp1 cKO mice, leading to failure in inducing hyperphagia. In line with our results, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Dietrich et al., 2013</xref> have shown that in mice with AgRP-selective deletion of <italic>Mfn1</italic> and <italic>Mfn2</italic>, mediators of mitochondrial fusion process, neuronal firing frequency was impaired in diet-inducedÂ obesity mice. The impairment of AgRP neuronal activation was reversed by increasing intracellular ATP levels (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Dietrich et al., 2013</xref>), indicating that the impaired AgRP neuronal firing frequency is likely due to low intracellular ATP levels. In addition to these functions, changes in shape and size of mitochondria may also affect the ability of a cell to distribute its mitochondrial population to specific subcellular locations. This function is especially important in highly polarized cells, such as neurons. Future studies assessing mitochondrial dynamics with changes in mitochondrial subcellular distribution will address this point.</p><p>In addition to mitochondria, DRP1 has been also shown to enable peroxisomal fission. Peroxisomes are single-membrane organelles that similar to mitochondria catalyze the breakdown of long chain fatty acids through beta-oxidation and regulate the maintenance of redox homeostasis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Smith and Aitchison, 2013</xref>). Because of these shared properties and metabolic pathways, we cannot exclude a possible involvement of peroxisomes in the phenotype observed in our mice. Further studies are warranted to address this issue.</p><p>Overall, our data unmask that mitochondrial fission in hypothalamic AgRP neurons is a fundamental mechanism that allows these neurons to sense and respond to changesÂ in circulating signals, including hormones such as ghrelin and nutrients such as glucose and palmitic acid, in the regulation of feeding and energy metabolism.</p></sec><sec sec-type="materials|methods" id="s4"><title>Materials and methods</title><table-wrap id="keyresource" position="anchor"><label>Key resources table</label><table frame="hsides" rules="groups"><thead><tr><th valign="top">Reagent type <break/>(species) or resource</th><th valign="top">Designation</th><th valign="top">Source or reference</th><th valign="top">Identifiers</th><th valign="top">Additional information</th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td valign="top">Strain, strain background <break/>(<italic>M. musculus</italic>)</td><td valign="top"><italic>Agrp<sup>Cre:ERT2</sup></italic></td><td valign="top">Wang et al., 2013</td><td valign="top"/><td valign="top"/></tr><tr><td valign="top">Strain, strain background <break/>(<italic>M. musculus</italic>)</td><td valign="top"><italic>Ai14(Rosa-CAG-LSL-tdTmoato)</italic></td><td valign="top">The Jackson Laboratory</td><td valign="top">Stock No: #007914</td><td valign="top"/></tr><tr><td valign="top">Strain, strain background <break/>(<italic>M. musculus</italic>)</td><td valign="top"><italic>Dnm1l</italic> floxed mouse</td><td valign="top"><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Kageyama et al., 2014</xref></td><td valign="top"/><td valign="top"/></tr><tr><td valign="top">Strain, strain background <break/>(<italic>M. musculus</italic>)</td><td valign="top"><italic>Rpl22</italic> floxed mouse</td><td valign="top">The Jackson Laboratory</td><td valign="top">Stock No #029977</td><td valign="top"/></tr><tr><td valign="top">Biological sample (<italic>M. musculus</italic>)</td><td valign="top">Primary hypothalamic neuronal cells</td><td valign="top">This paper</td><td valign="top"/><td valign="top">Freshly isolated from <italic>M. musculus</italic> in S.

Serum samples and standards were analyzed in duplicate. All procedures were performed by following the manufacturerâs protocol.</p></sec><sec id="s4-17"><title>Statistical analysis</title><p>Two-way ANOVA was used to determine the effect of the genotype and treatment with the Prism 7.01 software (GraphPad Software). For repeated measures analysis, ANOVA was used when values over different times were analyzed. When only two groups were analyzed, statistical significance was determined by an unpaired Student's <italic>t</italic>-test. A value of p&lt;0.05 was considered statistically significant. All data is shown as mean Â± SEM, unless otherwise stated.</p></sec></sec></body><back><ack id="ack"><title>Acknowledgements</title><p>This work was supported by NIH R01 DK097566, DK107293, and

The authors selectively inactivated a key protein required for mitochondrial fission in AgRP neurons that are important for feeding and protection from starvation. This manipulation resulted in reduced activity of these neurons and a lean phenotype, clearly demonstrating that disruption of mitochondrial dynamics impacts the normal functions of these neurons.</p><p><bold>Decision letter after peer review:</bold></p><p>Thank you for submitting your article &quot;DRP1 is required for AgRP neuronal activity and feeding&quot; for consideration by <italic>eLife</italic>. Your article has been reviewed by three peer reviewers, including Richard D Palmiter as the Reviewing Editor and Reviewer #1, and the evaluation has been overseen by Matt Kaeberlein as the Senior Editor.</p><p>The reviewers have discussed the reviews with one another and the Reviewing Editor has drafted this decision to help you prepare a revised submission.</p><p>As the editors have judged that your manuscript is of interest, but as described below that additional experiments are required before it is published, we would like to draw your attention to changes in our revision policy that we have made in response to COVID-19 (https://elifesciences.org/articles/57162). First, because many researchers have temporarily lost access to the labs, we will give authors as much time as they need to submit revised manuscripts. We are also offering, if you choose, to post the manuscript to bioRxiv (if it is not already there) along with this decision letter and a formal designation that the manuscript is &quot;in revision at <italic>eLife</italic>&quot;. Please let us know if you would like to pursue this option. (If your work is more suitable for medRxiv, you will need to post the preprint yourself, as the mechanisms for us to do so are still in development.)</p><p>The authors of this paper demonstrate that mitochondrial fission is important for normal AgRP neuron function. Mice lacking DRP1, a key enzyme mediating fission, in AgRP neurons have lower neuronal activity, respond less well to ghrelin, gain less weight than control mice and have reduced fatty acid metabolism. The authors provide a compelling set of data to substantiate their claims and describe their results clearly; however, a few issues need to be addressed.</p><p>Essential revisions:</p><p>1) The authors should provide more compelling evidence that energy expenditure (EE) is increased in mice lacking Drp1 in AgRP neurons because measuring EE per gram body weight when the weights of the mice differs can be misleading.</p><p>2) For the data in Figure 2, it is not clear to what extent AgRP neurons contribute to the difference fatty acid oxidation. Comparison of the data in Figure 2 (cultures from wild-type mice) with the data in Figure 3 (Drp1 cKO mice) are used to demonstrate the importance of Drp1 for fatty acid oxidation. This comparison is troublesome because they were done with primary cultures prepared and assayed at different times and the extent of Drp1 KO was not established. A better design would be to prepare cultures from the <italic>Agrp-CreERt::Dnml1(fl/fl)</italic> mice that were either treated with tamoxifen or not and then assayed for fatty acid oxidation at the same time.</p><p>3) The authors should at least discuss the possibility that Drp1 may affect other organelles, e.g., peroxisomes, that are involved in fatty acid oxidation.</p><p>4) The experiments in Figure 5, Supplementary Figure 2 and Figure 5âfigure supplement 1, reveal significantly less AgRP staining in cell bodies and projections in the Drp1 cKO mice compared to controls and significantly more aMSH in cell bodies and projections. Is that because there is less <italic>Agrp</italic> mRNA and more <italic>Pomc</italic> mRNA in the cKO mice?</p><p>5) AgRP neurons are not a uniform population; there differences along rostral-caudal region, differences in gene expression and they projection axons to specific brain regions. The authors should take this into consideration when discussing their data or demonstrate uniformity of effect across the rostral-caudal axis.</p><p>Included below are the original reviews that provide further insight into issues that the reviewers considered need attention.</p><p><italic>Reviewer #1:</italic></p><p>AgRP neuron activation, which normally occurs in response to food deprivation, enhances food intake and decreases energy expenditure. So, reduced AgRP neuron activity is predicted to have the opposite effect as shown here. There is some concern that the energy expenditure (EE) was measured at 4 months when the mice were already about 2 g lighter than controls (Figure 6). Thus, expressing EE on a per gram basis (rather than per mouse) may artificially enhance the effect. It is easier to appreciate a difference in EE if measurements are made before there is a difference in body weight. Figure 6I appears to show EE per mouse/day as a function of body weight but no statistics are provided.</p><p>The Discussion largely reiterates the Abstract and Results without providing any insight into why mitochondrial fission is important for normal AgRP function. Some discussion of how mitochondrial fission might influence fatty acid metabolism and signaling pathways necessary for normal neuronal function would be appreciated.

The authors show that during fasting, expression of phosphorylated, active DRP1 is increased in AgRP neurons resulting in the fragmentation of the mitochondrial network. However, upon cell type specific DRP1 deletion AgRP neurons are protected from fasting-induced fragmentation. In addition, DRP1 KO neurons present decreased neuronal activity in the fasted state as well as upon ghrelin treatment, concomitant with reduced AgRP-reactive projections within the hypothalamus. The metabolic consequences caused by these alterations lead to decreased fatty acids oxidation, reduced body weight, fat mass and food intake as well as increased energy expenditure. Given the broad interest in understanding how the CNS controls energy and glucose metabolism, the data are relevant and contribute to a better understanding of the mechanisms implicated in this regulation. The manuscript is very well written and the data largely support the authors' conclusions.</p><p>However, a few points should be addressed to improve the current manuscript:</p><p>In Figure 2, authors specify that primary hypothalamic neurons were used for measuring Î²-oxidation upon treatment with different glucose concentrations. However, no data are provided for what contribution AgRP neurons make to these cultures. Hypothalamic neuronal culture purity should be verified via qPCR, western-blot or ICC to determine the proportion of AgRP neurons in the culture.</p><p>Results in Figure 3 show that mitochondrial respiration is affected in primary hypothalamic neurons upon AgRP-neuron restricted DRP1 deletion. Nevertheless, the authors do not provide any knock-out confirmation and efficiency for this in vitro model. Knock-out validation and knock-out efficiency should be provided. Moreover, in the Materials and methods section it is described that primary neurons were treated with 4-hydroxytamoxifen to induce the CreERT2-dependent deletion. However, the authors do not include any control group in the seahorse data. They should include a control group of primary neurons treated with 4-hydroxytamoxifen to probe that the treatment itself does not have any detrimental effects for these primary cells.</p><p>In Figure 5, Supplementary Figure 2 and Figure 5âfigure supplement 1, the authors investigate AgRP- and POMC- immunoreactive projections to several nuclei within the hypothalamus. However, the authors provide no controls to assess whether potentially changes in AgRP or Î±-MSH expression contribute to the changes in the projection density. Here, the reported reduction of AgRP fibers or the increase of Î±-MSH fibers can be caused, indeed, by an alteration in the innervation or because the expression of AgRP and Î±-MSH are reduced or increased, respectively. Therefore, the authors should test whether the expression of AgRP and POMC are changed between controls and DRP1 KO animals.</p><p>Finally, in Figure 7, IHC experiments where AgRP neurons are activated upon ghrelin treatment in control and DRP1 KO animals are shown. However, no baseline activation upon saline treatment is provided. This would be important to compare the activation upon Ghrelin treatment.</p><p><italic>Reviewer #3:</italic></p><p>The alternative hypothesis is that lack of DRP1 may impair peroxisome fission/function, and thus b-oxidation of fatty acids, a central function of peroxisomes, is not investigated or discussed in the paper. For this paper to be accepted, experiments either ruling out this possibility or adding it as an additional mechanism are necessary.</p><p>In the paper, the authors make two claims related to AgRP neurons: 1) that mitochondrial dynamics are important for their function, and 2) so is fatty acid oxidation. However, the assays presented in Figures 2 and 3 related to fatty acid oxidation use primary hypothalamic cell culture. As AgRP neurons make up a small fraction of the hypothalamus, claims in this regard should be tempered to prevent misinterpretation by the reader, and the two data sets should be presented together. Alternatively, additional testing using an <italic>Agrp</italic> neuron-specific or enriched primary culture would be acceptable.</p><p>For Figure 1G, although there is a clear (and expected) difference of <italic>Agrp</italic> transcript in your IP sample, I would have expected to see similar differences in your input sample. However, the y-axis range may be hiding these changes. Please split the y-axis so that we can see any differences in input samples for the <italic>Agrp</italic> transcript. Also, as many publications have found significant and reproducible differences in <italic>Agrp</italic> transcript without using the RiboTag approach, I would have expected the <italic>Agrp</italic> input samples' differences to be significant, even if we cannot see those differences as currently presented. As this data point serves as validation for the methodology of multiple parts of Figure 1, the lack of significance must be explained. If the authors used the same dissection methodology for the primary hypothalamic neurons culture assays (Figures 2 and 3), multiple assays in this paper are in question.</p><p>Although the histological images presented in Figures 1, 4, 5, 7, Figure 3âfigure supplement 1, Supplementary Figure 2, Figure 5âfigure supplement 1 look reasonably convincing, AgRP neurons are spread rostral to caudal within the arcuate nucleus for nearly 2 mm, and conclusions based upon the sample size of 1 histological image out of the entirety of the arc can be misleading. Full stereology of the arcuate nucleus (at least six sections), and the PVN (at least four sections), is necessary to support these claims.</p></body></sub-article><sub-article article-type="reply" id="sa2"><front-stub><article-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.64351.sa2</article-id><title-group><article-title>Author response</article-title></title-group></front-stub><body><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Essential revisions:</p><p>1) The authors should provide more compelling evidence that energy expenditure (EE) is increased in mice lacking Drp1 in AgRP neurons because measuring EE per gram body weight when the weights of the mice differs can be misleading.</p></disp-quote><p>Energy expenditure (EE) has been recalculated using the lean mass that was not different between control and knockout mice.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>2) For the data in Figure 2, it is not clear to what extent AgRP neurons contribute to the difference fatty acid oxidation.

So, reduced AgRP neuron activity is predicted to have the opposite effect as shown here. There is some concern that the energy expenditure (EE) was measured at 4 months when the mice were already about 2 g lighter than controls (Figure 6). Thus, expressing EE on a per gram basis (rather than per mouse) may artificially enhance the effect. It is easier to appreciate a difference in EE if measurements are made before there is a difference in body weight. Figure 6I appears to show EE per mouse/day as a function of body weight but no statistics are provided.</p></disp-quote><p>Energy expenditure (EE) has been recalculated using the lean mass that was not different between control and knockout mice.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>The Discussion largely reiterates the Abstract and Results without providing any insight into why mitochondrial fission is important for normal AgRP function. Some discussion of how mitochondrial fission might influence fatty acid metabolism and signaling pathways necessary for normal neuronal function would be appreciated. Does fission allow a more efficient distribution of mitochondria in critical regions of the cell?</p></disp-quote><p>We have now added an additional paragraph discussing the potential role of mitochondrial dynamics in mitochondrial subcellular distribution:</p><p>âIn addition to these functions, changes in shape and size of mitochondria may also affect the ability of a cell to distribute its mitochondrial population to specific subcellular locations. This function is especially important in highly polarized cells, such as neurons. Future studies assessing mitochondrial dynamics with changes in mitochondrial subcellular distribution will address this point.â</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Editorial suggestions:</p><p>Abstract: Are AgRP neurons crucial if mice can adapt to their loss?</p></disp-quote><p>One could argue that they are so crucial that the brain has developed a mechanism to adapt to their loss.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Abstract: Why switch from DRP1 to Drp1 when referring to KO mice?</p></disp-quote><p>To indicate protein.

The authors show that during fasting, expression of phosphorylated, active DRP1 is increased in AgRP neurons resulting in the fragmentation of the mitochondrial network. However, upon cell type specific DRP1 deletion AgRP neurons are protected from fasting-induced fragmentation. In addition, DRP1 KO neurons present decreased neuronal activity in the fasted state as well as upon ghrelin treatment, concomitant with reduced AgRP-reactive projections within the hypothalamus. The metabolic consequences caused by these alterations lead to decreased fatty acids oxidation, reduced body weight, fat mass and food intake as well as increased energy expenditure. Given the broad interest in understanding how the CNS controls energy and glucose metabolism, the data are relevant and contribute to a better understanding of the mechanisms implicated in this regulation. The manuscript is very well written and the data largely support the authors' conclusions.</p><p>However, a few points should be addressed to improve the current manuscript:</p><p>In Figure 2, authors specify that primary hypothalamic neurons were used for measuring Î²-oxidation upon treatment with different glucose concentrations. However, no data are provided for what contribution AgRP neurons make to these cultures. Hypothalamic neuronal culture purity should be verified via qPCR, western-blot or ICC to determine the proportion of AgRP neurons in the culture.</p></disp-quote><p>These data are now shown in Figure 2âfigure supplement 1A-D.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Results in Figure 3 show that mitochondrial respiration is affected in primary hypothalamic neurons upon AgRP-neuron restricted DRP1 deletion. Nevertheless, the authors do not provide any knock-out confirmation and efficiency for this in vitro model. Knock-out validation and knock-out efficiency should be provided.</p></disp-quote><p>These data are now shown in Figure 3âfigure supplement 2F.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Moreover, in the Materials and methods section it is described that primary neurons were treated with 4-hydroxytamoxifen to induce the CreERT2-dependent deletion. However, the authors do not include any control group in the seahorse data.</p></disp-quote><p>As suggested by this reviewer, we have now added in Figure 3G-J data from <italic>Agrp-CreERT2::Dnml1(fl/fl)</italic> mice treated with vehicle as control group.

However, the authors provide no controls to assess whether potentially changes in AgRP or Î±-MSH expression contribute to the changes in the projection density. Here, the reported reduction of AgRP fibers or the increase of Î±-MSH fibers can be caused, indeed, by an alteration in the innervation or because the expression of AgRP and Î±-MSH are reduced or increased, respectively. Therefore, the authors should test whether the expression of AgRP and POMC are changed between controls and DRP1 KO animals.</p></disp-quote><p>We have now performed qPCR analysis from RiboTag mice (Figure 5âfigure supplement 2B and C) and found no significant differences in AgRP and POMC mRNA levels between Drp1 cKO and control mice.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Finally, in Figure 7, IHC experiments where AgRP neurons are activated upon ghrelin treatment in control and DRP1 KO animals are shown.

For this paper to be accepted, experiments either ruling out this possibility or adding it as an additional mechanism are necessary.</p></disp-quote><p>We have now added a paragraph in the Discussion on this possibility:</p><p>âIn addition to mitochondria, DRP1 has been also shown to enable peroxisomal fission. Peroxisomes are single-membrane organelles that similar to mitochondria catalyze the breakdown of long chain fatty acids through beta-oxidation and regulate the maintenance of redox homeostasis (Smith and Aitchison, 2013). Because of these shared properties and metabolic pathways, we cannot exclude a possible involvement of peroxisomes in the phenotype observed in our mice. Further studies are warranted to address this issue.â</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>In the paper, the authors make two claims related to AgRP neurons: 1) that mitochondrial dynamics are important for their function, and 2) so is fatty acid oxidation. However, the assays presented in Figures 2 and 3 related to fatty acid oxidation use primary hypothalamic cell culture. As AgRP neurons make up a small fraction of the hypothalamus, claims in this regard should be tempered to prevent misinterpretation by the reader, and the two data sets should be presented together. Alternatively, additional testing using an Agrp neuron-specific or enriched primary culture would be acceptable.</p></disp-quote><p>As also suggested by reviewer 2, we have now added in Figure 3 data from primary cultures treated with vehicle (as control group) derived from <italic>Dnm1l<sup>fl/fl</sup>; Agrp<sup>Cre:ERT2</sup></italic>;tdTomato mice.

However, the y-axis range may be hiding these changes. Please split the y-axis so that we can see any differences in input samples for the Agrp transcript. Also, as many publications have found significant and reproducible differences in Agrp transcript without using the RiboTag approach, I would have expected the Agrp input samples' differences to be significant, even if we cannot see those differences as currently presented.</p></disp-quote><p>We have now corrected the y axis to see the difference in input samples in Figure 1G and H.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>As this data point serves as validation for the methodology of multiple parts of Figure 1, the lack of significance must be explained.

Furthermore, we did use different methods for dissection in the RiboTag experiment versus the primary hypothalamic neuronal culture experiments.

Full stereology of the arcuate nucleus (at least six sections), and the PVN (at least four sections), is necessary to support these claims.</p></disp-quote><p>We have now revised our analyses using sections at different levels of the rostral- caudal axis.
