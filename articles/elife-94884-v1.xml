are a valuable resource for cell therapy, drug screening, and disease modelling. Here, we developed a novel inducible CRISPR-mediated activation strategy (iCRISPRa) to drive the expression of multiple endogenous transcription factors (TFs) important for in vitro cell fate and differentiation of iPSCs to haematopoietic progenitor cells. This work has identified a key role for IGFBP2 in developing haematopoietic progenitors. We first identified nine candidate TFs that we predicted to be involved in blood cell emergence during development, then generated tagged gRNAs directed to the transcriptional start site of these TFs that could also be detected during single-cell RNA sequencing (scRNAseq). iCRISPRa activation of these endogenous TFs resulted in a significant expansion of arterial-fated endothelial cells expressing high levels of IGFBP2, and our analysis indicated that IGFBP2 is involved in the remodelling of metabolic activity during in vitro endothelial to haematopoietic transition. As well as providing fundamental new insights into the mechanisms of haematopoietic differentiation, the broader applicability of iCRISPRa provides a valuable tool for studying dynamic processes in development and for recapitulating abnormal phenotypes characterised by ectopic activation of specific endogenous gene expression in a wide range of systems.</p></abstract><kwd-group

The precise signalling pathways leading to the production of haematopoietic stem and progenitor cells (HSPCs) during embryonic development are yet to be completely defined, posing a limitation on how to recapitulate the process in vitro from pluripotent stem cells.</p><p>During development, HSPCs are generated by a subset of endothelial cells, known as haemogenic endothelium (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Jaffredo et al., 1998</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib48">Zovein et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Bertrand et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Boisset et al., 2010</xref>), via the endothelial to haematopoietic transition (EHT) <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Ottersbach, 2019</xref>. During the EHT, endothelial cells undergo profound transcriptional remodelling whereby the expression of endothelial genes is gradually downregulated, and the transcription of the haematopoietic program is initiated (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib42">Swiers et al., 2013</xref>) while the cells round up and eventually detach to enter the circulation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Kissa and Herbomel, 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Eilken et al., 2009</xref>).</p><p>To explore the molecular control on the development of the haematopoietic system and to address the differences with the in vitro differentiation of induced pluripotent stem cells (iPSCs), we compared our single-cell transcriptomics analysis of in vitro-derived haemogenic endothelium and early progenitors (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Fidanza et al., 2020</xref>) to that of the in vivo HSC-primed human haemogenic endothelium (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib46">Zeng et al., 2019</xref>). We then developed a novel doxycycline (DOX)-inducible CRISPR gene activation system to assess the role of the genes that were expressed at a lower level within in vitro-derived cells compared to their in vivo counterparts. We employed single-cell RNA sequencing (scRNAseq) to track the presence of guide RNAs and we monitored the phenotypic effects of gene activation. With this experimental pipeline, we identified and functionally validated a novel role for IGFBP2, IGF binding protein 2, in the development of in vitro progenitors and showed that IGBP2 remodels the metabolic activity during in vitro EHT.</p></sec><sec id="s2" sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><sec id="s2-1"><title>Comparison of iPSC-derived endothelial cells with AGM endothelial cells dataset identifies nine differentially expressed transcription factors</title><p>We, and others, have shown that in vitro differentiation of human iPSCs (hiPSCs) is a powerful tool to model intraembryonic haematopoiesis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Fidanza et al., 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">Ng et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Calvanese et al., 2022</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib41">Sturgeon et al., 2014</xref>).

The <italic>AAVS1</italic> locus has been reported to be a ‘safe harbour’ site that is resistant to epigenetic silencing and indeed, we had previously demonstrated that transgenes inserted into the <italic>AAVS1</italic> locus under the control of the constitutively active CAG promoter were efficiently expressed both in undifferentiated and in differentiated iPSCs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib45">Yang et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Lopez-Yrigoyen et al., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Lopez-Yrigoyen et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">May et al., 2023</xref>). However, after the iSAM line had been established and cultured under self-renewal conditions, we noted a dramatic reduction in the number of mCherry+ cells in undifferentiated iSAM iPSCs upon DOX induction. We predicted this to be due to transgene silencing of the rTTA DOX-inducible cassette (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s2">Figure 2—figure supplement 2C</xref>). To overcome this problem, we treated the iSAM iPSC line with an inhibitor of histone deacetylases (HDACs), sodium butyrate (SB), reported to have no adverse effect on iPSC maintenance (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Kang et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib47">Zhang et al., 2014</xref>) and we also confirmed that the treatment with SB had no effect on viability and cell proliferation in our culture conditions (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s2">Figure 2—figure supplement 2F and G</xref>). A short 48 hr treatment significantly increased the number of mCherry+ cells upon DOX induction, proportional to the SB concentration (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s2">Figure 2—figure supplement 2D and E</xref>). We, therefore, maintained the iSAM iPSCs in the presence of SB and this fully restored the inducibility of the transgene with virtually all cells expressing mCherry in the presence of DOX (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s2">Figure 2—figure supplement 2G</xref>). We did not treat the cells with SB during the differentiation since we detected robust expression of the iSAM cassette during the differentiation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s1">Figure 3—figure supplement 1F</xref>). Furthermore, since the HDACs are also involved in the chromatin remodelling during the EHT process (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib43">Thambyrajah et al., 2018</xref>), we predicted that SB treatment would negatively affect the differentiation.</p><p>To test the effect of activating the nine target genes on the transcriptomes of differentiating iPSC cells, we engineered the gRNAs to allow their detection within the scRNAseq pipeline (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">Replogle et al., 2020</xref>). We inserted a capture sequence prior to the termination signal to avoid any alteration in the secondary structure of the loops thus preserving the binding of the synergistic activators of the SAM system to the stem loops of the gRNAs. Of the two capture sequences available (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">Replogle et al., 2020</xref>), we decided to use the one that was predicted to result in fewer secondary structure alterations and this new gRNA was named 2.1 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2E</xref>). We compared the activation level achieved with the new 2.1 gRNA to that of the original 2.0 backbone using various gRNAs targeting <italic>RUNX1C</italic> (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2F</xref>). These results convincingly demonstrated that the addition of the capture sequence in the gRNA 2.1 does not alter the level of endogenous gene activation that could be achieved (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2G</xref>). Altogether, these results show that the iSAM system is able to induce gene expression that predictably translates into an increased protein expression and thus provides a platform to steer phenotypical changes in cell identity.</p><p>To activate our target genes, we designed 5–7 gRNAs in the 200 bp upstream of the transcriptional start sites of each of the 9 target genes.

A high level of <italic>GJA4</italic> and <italic>DLL4</italic> expression was used to annotate the arterial-like cell cluster, while high levels of haemogenic markers, such as <italic>RUNX1</italic> and <italic>CD44</italic>, were used to annotate the haemogenic clusters, EHT_1 and EHT_2 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3B, C and D</xref>). All the clusters expressed pan-endothelial markers such as <italic>PECAM1</italic> and <italic>CDH5</italic>, coding for CD31 and VECAD, respectively, which get progressively downregulated in EHT_1 and EHT_2, as expected for cells undergoing the EHT process. To assess the effect of the activation on cell identity, we analysed the proportion of the cell clusters between the libraries and detected a significant expansion of the arterial cluster in the DOX-induced iSAM-AGM compared to the iSAM_NT cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3E</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s1">Figure 3—figure supplement 1D and I</xref>). To validate the effect of the activation on the expansion of arterial cell population, we analysed their prevalence by flow cytometry. Although DOX treatment resulted in an average 1.63±0.13-fold increase of CD34<sup>+</sup>DLL4<sup>+</sup> cells in the control iSAM_NT sample (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s2">Figure 2—figure supplement 2A</xref>), the increase observed in the iSAM-AGM cells was significantly greater, with an expansion of 3.33±0.73-fold increase of CD34<sup>+</sup>DLL4<sup>+</sup> immunophenotypic arterial cells identified by flow cytometry (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3F</xref>). To assess the effect of the different cell composition in the CD34+ compartment upon activation on the emergence of colony-forming progenitors, we isolated CD34+ cells using magnetic beads and cocultured 20,000 cells on OP9 supportive stromal cells for 7 days in the presence of haematopoietic differentiation cytokines.

We then compared the gRNA distribution in these arterial cells from the iSAM_AGM treated with DOX to that of arterial cells without activation. We observed a significant enrichment of the <italic>RUNX1T1-specific</italic> gRNAs (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="supp1">Supplementary file 1</xref>), indicating that the increased <italic>IGFBP2</italic> expression could be downstream of <italic>RUNX1T1</italic> activation. IGF binding protein 2 is a member of the family of IGF binding proteins and is thought to be secreted from cells where it then binds IGF1, IGF2, and other extracellular matrix proteins, modulating their function. IGF1 and IGF2 are commonly used in differentiation protocols (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Ditadi et al., 2015</xref>), including ours (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib44">Ventura et al., 2023</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Fidanza et al., 2020</xref>), due to their direct role in blood development. To test if the increased frequency of functional haematopoietic progenitors was due to IGFBP2 signalling, presumably derived from the arterial cells, we supplemented the media with IGFBP2 at 100 ng/ml after the induction of endothelial cell differentiation. To explore the role of IGFBP2, we employed the parental iPSCs line, SFCi55, from which the iSAM line was derived. We isolated CD34+ cells at day 8 and cocultured them on OP9 cells in the presence of IGFBP2 for 1 week, then tested for their haematopoietic clonogenic potential using CFU assays (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4B</xref>). Cells treated with IGFBP2 showed a significant increase in the total number of haematopoietic CFU colonies compared to cells in control cultures. To assess whether IGFBP2 also affected the production of arterial cells themselves, we analysed the proportion of DLL4+ cells, but no difference was detected in the presence of IGFBP2 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4C</xref>). This implies that the mechanism of action of IGFBP2 is different from that mediated by the gene activation that led to an expansion of the arterial population. To further understand the relationship between colonies’ potential with the arterial identity, we sorted CD34+ into DLL4+ and DLL4- and cultured them on OP9 coculture for a week prior to methylcellulose assay. CD34+DLL4+ and CD34+DLL4- plated on OP9 showed different capacity to generate suspension cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5s1">Figure 5—figure supplement 1D</xref>), in line with the colonies’ formation results showing that the DLL4- contains the largest progenitor activity.

Since the metabolic switch between glycolytic to mitochondrial metabolism has been previously reported in definitive haematopoiesis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Azzoni et al., 2021</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">Oburoglu et al., 2022</xref>), we tested whether the addition of IGFBP2 could result in a different ATP production profile. We analysed the ATP production at day 13, when RUNX1 expression was induced by IGFBP2 addition, by using specific inhibitors of the complex I and II and complex V to quantify the intracellular ATP and mitochondrial synthesis, respectively. We detected a reduction in glycolytic-derived ATP (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5E and F</xref>), which translates to a higher contribution of mitochondria metabolism for IGFBP2-treated cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5G</xref>). We then looked at the expression levels of genes encoding the enzymes of the glycolytic pathway and its checkpoints, glucose and lactate transporters, monocarboxylate transporters, and the enzymes associated with hexokinase and phosphofructose reactions. We observed a general downregulation of the glycolytic enzymes and its checkpoints, with the exception of <italic>PFKM</italic> and <italic>SLC16A1</italic> (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5s1">Figure 5—figure supplement 1A and B</xref>), which were expressed at lower levels in the IGFBP2-treated cells at day 13 compared to the control on the same day. These differences were not observed on day 10 cells, which is consistent with our previous observations that the IGFBP2-induced remodelling of the endothelial cells’ transcriptome happens exclusively on day 13.</p><p>To assess whether the higher clonogenic potential and effect on the bioenergetic profile of the cells treated with IGFBP2 was the result of an increase in proliferation, we analysed the cell cycle profile of suspension haematopoietic cells obtained from the OP9 cocultured in the presence of IGFBP2. No differences in the cell cycle distribution of haematopoietic progenitors (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s1">Figure 3—figure supplement 1E</xref>) was observed, indicating that the detected increase in haematopoietic progenitors is not likely to be a consequence of their increased cycling. We, therefore, concluded the effect of IGBP2 occurs prior to, or during their emergence via the EHT process.</p><p>In summary, our results show that the activation of the nine target transcription factors, expressed at higher levels in vivo within the arterial cells in the AGM region, leads to the expansion of the arterial cells and, consequently, to an increase in progenitor activity (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6</xref>). IGFBP2 was identified as the most upregulated gene in the arterial cell upon gene activation.

We hypothesised that this could, in part, be due to the inability to recapitulate the appropriate transcriptional programme in cultured cells. Here, we developed a novel CRISPR activation system to induce the expression of genes that are expressed at low levels in cells that are generated in vitro, to explore the downstream consequences of their activation and to assess the effects on emerging haematopoietic progenitor cells.</p><p>When we compared endothelial cells derived in vitro from hiPSCs to those in the AGM region of the human embryo, at the time point when early haematopoietic commitment takes place, we identified nine transcription factors that were expressed at a lower level in the cultured cells. Some of these had been associated with blood cell development, including <italic>GATA2</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Castaño et al., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">de Pater et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Ling et al., 2004</xref>), SMAD7 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">McGarvey et al., 2017</xref>), NR4A1 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">McGarvey et al., 2017</xref>), SOX6 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">McGrath et al., 2011</xref>), and RUNX1T1 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib46">Zeng et al., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Calvanese et al., 2022</xref>). Other genes such as ZNF124, ZNF33A, NFAT5, and TFDP2 had not been previously associated with haematopoiesis and could provide early evidence of their possible role in haematopoiesis that will require further studies. We were particularly interested in <italic>RUNX1T1</italic> (also known as ETO) which is associated with the leukemic fusion protein, AML1/ETO, resulting from the t(8;21) chromosomal translocation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">Rejeski et al., 2021</xref>). Furthermore, <italic>RUNX1T1</italic> expression has been recently detected in transcriptomic analyses of the human AGM region (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib46">Zeng et al., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Calvanese et al., 2022</xref>), but its precise role during the ontogeny of the blood system has not been elucidated. The addition of a capture sequence to the gRNA backbone enabled their detection coincidentally with the single-cell transcriptome, and this allowed us to demonstrate that RUNX1T1 gRNAs were significantly enriched in cells within an expanded arterial cluster and their presence was associated with the highest expression of <italic>IGFBP2</italic> across clusters. <italic>IGFBP2</italic> KO mice show increased expression of cell cycle inhibitors and HSC apoptosis, implicating IGFBP2 as a modulator of HSCs cell cycle and survival (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Huynh et al., 2011</xref>). More recently <italic>IGFBP2</italic> was reported as being highly expressed in the human AGM region at CS14 when HSCs are emerging (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Calvanese et al., 2022</xref>), supporting a possible role during developmental haematopoiesis but the precise molecular process was unclear. In this study, we show that the addition of IGFBP2 recombinant protein in our in vitro model of EHT results in the emergence of an increased number of functional haematopoietic progenitors, and we provide an early observation to suggest that RUNX1T1 could be involved in the regulation of its expression. Because RUNX1T1 lacks a DNA binding domain, its direct involvement in the regulation of IGFBP2 expression, or in the development of the haematopoietic system in general, must require association with other cofactors that are yet to be identified.</p><p>Our data, together with in vivo data (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Calvanese et al., 2022</xref>), show that IGFBP2 is expressed predominantly by endothelial cells. The supportive role of the endothelial niche in the development of HSCs has been studied in vivo (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Crosse et al., 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Hadland et al., 2022</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Hadland et al., 2015</xref>) and exploited in vitro to support HSCs emergence (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Hadland et al., 2022</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib40">Sandler et al., 2014</xref>).</p><p>We describe here a novel role for IGFBP2 in the remodelling of the metabolism of iPSC-derived endothelial cells and that this is associated with the induction of RUNX1, a hallmark of haemogenic fate. The addition of IGFBP2 in the culture induces upregulation of the genes of the oxidative phosphorylation pathway in association with an increased relative mitochondrial contribution to cellular ATP production. This is due to reduced glycolysis in association with the downregulation of genes coding for glycolytic enzymes and their checkpoints. The switch between glycolytic to mitochondrial metabolism has been shown to be essential for the EHT in definitive haematopoiesis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">Oburoglu et al., 2022</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Azzoni et al., 2021</xref>). This switch is induced in vivo by mechanical cues downstream of the establishment of circulation, and it is required for functional HSCs development (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Azzoni et al., 2021</xref>), while in vitro, the switch is driven by pyruvate mitochondrial catabolism, leading to definitive EHT as opposed to primitive (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">Oburoglu et al., 2022</xref>). Further in vivo studies are required to characterise the role of IGFBP2 during AGM haematopoiesis to overcome the limitation of using an in vitro model such as iPSCs differentiation.</p><p>In conclusion, we detected transcriptional differences between in vivo and in vitro developmental haematopoiesis and developed a novel inducible gene activation system to identify novel molecular players during the EHT transition. Our multidisciplinary approach identified IGFBP2 as novel signalling molecules that support human blood progenitor development in vitro, inducing a metabolic switch from cytoplasmic glycolysis to mitochondrial respiration. This study demonstrates that combining CRISPR-mediated activation of target genes with single-cell transcriptomic analysis in differentiating hPSCs can be a powerful approach to alter cell fate, providing a tool for gene function studies during human development. The fine epigenetic manipulation of the transcription can be readily applied to any cell lineage simply by adding specific gRNAs and it will be instrumental in exploring other developmental processes that can be, at least partially, mimicked in vitro with hiPSCs. Some limitations remain in applying CRISPR-mediated gene activation strategies in long differentiation protocols due to the challenge of detecting high copy numbers of the gRNAs, limiting the possibility of providing the fine statistical correlation needed to predict downstream target genes. Testing different promoters driving the gRNA expression or structural modifications of the gRNA scaffold could result in a more robust expression and allow for correlation analysis.</p><p>Finally, using this approach, we have identified the supportive role of IGFBP2, predominantly produced by endothelial cells, which induces transcriptional and metabolic remodelling in association with the induction of <italic>RUNX1</italic> expression, and result in higher haematopoietic progenitors’ activity.</p></sec><sec id="s4" sec-type="methods"><title>Methods</title><sec id="s4-1"><title>Resource availability</title><p>R code is available at <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://github.com/afidanza/CRISPRa">https://github.com/afidanza/CRISPRa</ext-link> (copy archived at <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">afidanza, 2022</xref>), and in the Source Code 1 file.

Briefly, the two datasets were merged and normalised using the R package Seurat. Specific markers for haemogenic endothelium were identified and transcription factors were sorted based on their GO annotation. Within those genes we filtered those detected in more than 50% of the in vivo haemogenic endothelium and expressed in less than 25% of the in vitro-derived endothelial cells. This pipeline identified nine target genes <italic>RUNX1T1</italic>, <italic>NR4A1</italic>, <italic>GATA2</italic>, <italic>SMAD7</italic>, <italic>ZNF124</italic>, <italic>SOX6</italic>, <italic>ZNF33A</italic>, <italic>NFAT5</italic>, <italic>TFDP</italic>.</p></sec><sec id="s4-16"><title>AGM gRNAs library preparation</title><p>sgRNA design was performed by selecting the top candidates for on-target and off-target score.

All the guide variants were Golden Gate cloned with the gRNA 2.1 backbone according to the established protocol (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Konermann et al., 2015</xref>). The 49 plasmids were pooled together in an equimolar ratio and the library prep was subsequently used to produce lentiviral particles with a second-generation production system. Briefly, the psPAX2 packaging plasmid, pMD2.G envelope, and the AGM vector library were co-transfected using polyethyleneimine (Polysciences, Warrington, PA, USA) as previously detailed (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">Petazzi et al., 2020</xref>). Lentiviral particles-containing supernatants were harvested 48–72 hr post-transfection, concentrated by ultracentrifugation, and titered in hiPSCs cells.</p></sec><sec id="s4-17"><title>iSAM_AGM and iSAM_NT cell line derivation</title><p>The selected iSAM clone (3.13 internal coding) was infected with viral particles containing either the AGM library or the non-targeting gRNA (NT) at a MOI of 10. The iSAM cell line was plated the afternoon before at 7×10<sup>6</sup> cells into a T125 in the presence of 10 μM Rock Inhibitor (Merk) which was maintained until the day following the infection. Cells were infected in the presence of 8 μg/ml of Polybrene (Merk). Puromycin selection was initiated 36 hr post-infection and maintained during their culture until the beginning of the differentiation. Both lines were tested for integration of the gRNAs. Briefly, 100 ng of isolated gDNA was amplified using the PrimeSTAR MAX PCR mix (Takara) using the primers gRNA_screening_FW and gRNA_screening_RV (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="supp1">Supplementary file 1</xref>). Purified amplicons were subjected to Sanger sequencing.</p></sec><sec id="s4-18"><title>Single-cell RNA sequencing</title><p>For the iSAM_AGM and iSAM_NT scRNAseq experiment, EBs obtained from day 10 of differentiation were dissociated using Accutase (Life Technologies) at 37°C for 30. For the IGFBP2 experiment, day 10 and day 13 cells from the Laminin EHT culture were detached from the adherent layer using Accutase (Life Technologies) at 37°C for 5’. From both experiments, cells were centrifuged and resuspended in CD34-Pe staining solution at a density of 10<sup>7</sup>/ml. CD34+/live/single cells were FAC-sorted in PBS+0.1% BSA. Cell viability was also confirmed by Trypan blue stain for an accurate count. Around 15,000 cells per sample were loaded into the 10X Chromium Controller, and single-cell libraries were obtained using the Chromium Single Cell 3’ Reagent Kits v3 (10X Genomics) according to the manufacturer’s protocol. The four libraries were indexed using SI PCR primers with different i7 indexes to allow for demultiplexing of the sequencing data. RNA concentration was obtained using Quibit RNA HS (Thermo Fisher). Quality of the obtained libraries were verified using LabChip GX (PerkinElmer). Libraries were sequenced using NextSeq 2000 technology (Illumina) at 50.000 reads/cell. Data were aligned to GRCh38 using the Cell Ranger dedicated pipeline (10X Genomics). Data filtering, dimension reduction, clustering analysis, differentially expressed genes, and cell cycle analysis were obtained using Seurat R package (version 4.1.0) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Hao et al., 2021</xref>). Cells were subjected to QC and filtering using both the number of genes (1000–7500) and the percentage of mitochondrial genes detected (1–15%), resulting in 9025, 10,942, 9468, 13,073 cells respectively for the samples iSAM_NT, iSAM_NT+DOX, iSAM_AGM, and iSAM_AGM+DOX. Pseudotemporal ordering was performed using Monocle 3 R package (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Cao et al., 2019</xref>). KEGG pathways was performed using ShinyGo (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Ge et al., 2020</xref>). The gRNAs’ expression matrix was used to select cells in which the expression of the gRNAs was detected. Briefly, for the libraries derived from the iSAM_NT control containing only the NT gRNA, the filter was set for cells expressing one gRNA, while for the iSAM_AGM libraries was set to more than one.

On day 13, the cells’ ATP production rate was analysed with the Seahorse XF Real-Time ATP Rate Assay kit (Agilent) according to the manufacturer’s protocol, following confirmation of comparable cell densities across replicates and conditions. Briefly, the media was changed prior to the assay for the XF DMEM, pH 7.4, supplemented with 10 mM Seahorse XF glucose, 1 mM Seahorse XF pyruvate and 2 mM Seahorse XF Glutamine (Agilent) and incubated for 45–60 min in a non-CO<sub>2</sub> incubator. Oligomycin and Rotenone/AA solutions were prepared and added in the cartridge and finally loaded together with the cells in the Seahorse XF Mini Analyzer using the dedicated software. Data were collected at the end of the run, and the values of ATP production were calculated according to the ATP Production Rate Calculation provided by Agilent. Briefly, OCR ATP was calculated as OCR<sub>basal</sub>-OCR<sub>oligo</sub> averaged across the three reads for each well. Mitochondrial ATP was calculated as OCR<sub>ATP</sub> multiplied by the molecular oxygen consumption rate of 2 and by the P/O value of 2.75. For the glycolytic ATP production, we calculated the MitoPER as the OCR<sub>basal</sub>-OCR<sub>rot</sub> times the CO<sub>2</sub> contribution factor of 0.5. The PER was then calculated as the ECAR times the buffer factor of 2.6, the volume of reaction of 2.28 μl, and the Kvol value of 1.1. The GlycoATP production rate was obtained by removing the MitoPER from the PER, and the TotalATP was calculated by adding the GlycoATP and the MytoATP. Mito/Glyco ratio was obtained by dividing their ATP production value.</p></sec><sec id="s4-20"><title>Cell cycle analysis</title><p>DAPI staining and flow cytometry analysis were performed to verify the proliferation rate of the cells.

The authors developed an inducible CRISPR-mediated activation strategy (iCRISPRa) to test the impact of newly identified candidate factors on the generation of hematopoietic progenitors in vitro. They first compared previously published transcriptomic data of iPSCderived hemato-endothelial populations with cells isolated ex vivo from the aorta-gonadmesonephros (AGM) region of the human embryo and they identified 9 transcription factors expressed in the aortic hemogenic endothelium that were poorly expressed in the in vitro differentiated cells. They then tested the activation of these candidate factors in an iPSCbased culture system supporting the differentiation of hematopoietic progenitors in vitro. They found that the IGF binding protein 2 (IGFBP2) was the most upregulated gene in arterial endothelium after activation and they demonstrated that IGFBP2 promotes the generation of functional hematopoietic progenitors in vitro.</p><p>Strengths:</p><p>The authors developed an extremely useful doxycycline-inducible system to activate the expression of specific candidate genes in human iPSC. This approach allows us to simultaneously test the impact of 9 different transcription factors on in vitro differentiation of hematopoietic cells, and the system appears to be very versatile and applicable to a broad variety of studies.</p><p>The system was extensively validated for the expression of 1 transcription factor (RUNX1) in both HeLa cells and human iPSC, and a detailed characterization of this test experiment was provided.</p><p>The authors exhaustively demonstrated the role of IGFBP2 in promoting the generation of functional hematopoietic progenitors in vitro from iPSCs. Even though the use of IGFBP2interacting proteins IGF1 and IGF2 have been previously reported in human iPSC-derived hematopoietic differentiation in vitro (Ditadi and Sturgeon, Methods 2016; Ng et al., Nature Biotechnology 2016), and IGFBP-2 itself has been shown to promote adult HSC expansion ex vivo (Zhang et al., Blood 2008), its role on supporting in vitro hematopoiesis was demonstrated here for the first time.</p><p>Weaknesses:</p><p>Although the authors performed a very thorough characterization of the system in proof-ofprinciple experiments activating a single transcription factor, the data provided when 9 independent factors were used is not sufficient to fully validate the experimental strategy. Indeed, in the current version of the manuscript, it is not clear whether the results presented in both the scRNAseq analysis and the functional assays are the consequence of the simultaneous activation of all 9 TF or just a subset of them. This is essential to establish whether all the proposed factors play a role during embryonic hematopoiesis, and a more complete analysis of the scRNAseq dataset could help clarify this aspect.</p><p>Similarly, the data presented in the manuscript are not sufficient to clarify at what stage of the endothelial-to-hematopoietic transition (EHT) the TF activation has an impact. Indeed, even though the overall increase of functional hematopoietic progenitors is fully demonstrated, the assays proposed in the manuscript do not clarify whether this is due to a specific effect at the endothelial level or to an increased proliferation rate of the generated hematopoietic progenitors. Similar conclusions can be applied to the functional validation of IGFBP2 in vitro.</p><p>The overall conclusions are sometimes vague and not always supported by the data. For instance, the authors state that the CRISPR activation strategy resulted in transcriptional remodeling and a steer in cell identity, but they do not specify which cell types are involved and at what level of the EHT process this is happening. In the discussion, the authors also claim that they provided evidence to support that RUNX1T1 could regulate IGFBP2 expression. However, this is exclusively based on the enrichment of RUNX1T1 gRNA in cells expressing higher levels of IGFBP2 and it does not demonstrate any direct or indirect association of the two factors.</p></disp-quote><p>We thank the reviewer for the positive comments about the importance of our work and have now addressed the points raised as weaknesses by performing additional analysis and experiments, adding a new schematic of the mechanism, and rewording our claims.</p><p>We have clarified the different effects mediated by the activation and the IGFBP2 addition in a summary section at the end of the results and added Figure 6, showing this in visual form. We have also clearly stated the limitations related to the correlation between RUNX1T1 and IGFBP2 in the discussion and toned down our claims regarding this throughout the entire paper. We have also reworded the text to clarify the specific cell types identified in the sequencing data that we refer to.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p><bold>Reviewer #2 (Public Review):</bold></p><p>To enable robust production of hematopoietic progenitors in-vitro, Petazzi et al examined the role of transcription factors in the arterial hemogenic endothelium. They use IGFBP2 as a candidate gene to increase the directed differentiation of iPSCs into hematopoietic progenitors. They have established a novel induced-CRISPR mediated activation strategy to drive the expression of multiple endogenous transcription factors and show enhanced production of hematopoietic progenitors through expansion of the arterial endothelial cells. Further, upregulation of IGFBP2 in the arterial cells facilitates the metabolic switch from glycolysis to oxidative phosphorylation, inducing hematopoietic differentiation.

This is one of the primary reasons that we then validated our overall findings using the parental iPSC line in control condition and with the addition of IGFBP2.

We cannot exclude some contamination from non-endothelial cells but we highlight to this reviewer that the initial observation of the metabolic changes was identified in endothelial cells in the single cell sequencing data.

We have also added a summary section and a figure to clarify the different mechanisms of action of the gene activation and IGFBP2.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>(7) Figure 4- while the experiments conducted support the role of IGFBP2 in increasing hematopoietic output, there is no experimental evidence to prove its function through paracrine signalling in HECs. The authors need to provide some evidence of how IGFBP2 supplementation specifically expands only the hematopoietic progenitors. Experimental strategies involving specifically targeting IGFBP2 in hemogenic/arterial endothelial cells are required to prove its cell type specific function. Additionally, assessing the in vivo functional potential of the hematopoietic cells generated in the presence of IGFBP2, by bone-marrow transplantation of CD34+ CD43+ cells, is essential.</p></disp-quote><p>The role of IGFBP2 in the context of HSC production and expansion was not the topic of our research, and we have not claimed that IGFBP2 affects the long-term repopulating capacity of HSPCs.

Additional experiments are required to validate the function of IGFBP2 through modulation of metabolic activity. Inhibition of oxidative phosphorylation in the IGFBP2treated cells should reduce the hematopoietic output. Authors should consider doing these experiments to provide a stronger mechanistic insight into IGFBP2-mediated regulation of hematopoietic emergence.</p></disp-quote><p>We have now included the requested cluster composition in Supplementary Figure 5F. We decided not to include further tests on the metabolic profile of IGFBP2 as we already discussed in other papers that showed, using selective inhibitors, that the EHT coincides with a glycol to OxPhos switch.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>(10) It is very striking to see that IGFBP2 supplementation changes the transcriptional profile of developing hematopoietic cells by increasing transcription of OXPHOS-related genes with concomitant reduction of glycolytic signatures, particularly at Day 13. However, the mitochondrial ATP rate measurements do not seem convincing. The bioenergetic profiles show that when mitochondrial inhibitors are added, both groups exhibit decreased OCR values and, on the other hand, higher ECAR. This indicates that both groups have the capability to utilize OXPHOS or glycolysis and may only differ in their basal respiration rates.</p><p>Differences in proliferation rate can cause basal respiration to change. There is no information on how the bioenergetic profile was normalized (cell no./protein amount). Given that IGFBP2 has been shown to increase proliferation, it is very likely that the cells treated with IGFBP2 proliferated faster and therefore have higher OCR. The data needs to be normalized appropriately to negate this possibility.</p></disp-quote><p>We have previously tested whether IGFBP2 causes an increase in proliferation by analysing the cell cycle of cells treated with it, as we initially thought this could be a mechanism of action. We have now provided the quantification of the cell cycle in the cells treated with IGFBP2, showing no effect was observed in cell cycle Supplementary Figure 4E. Following this analysis, we decided to plate the same number of cells and test their density under the microscope before running the experiment; each experiment was done in triplicate for each condition. We have now added this info to the method sections lines 806-813. We did not comment on the basal difference, which we agree might be due to several factors, but we only compared the difference in response to the inhibitors, which isn’t affected by the basal level but exclusively by their D values. We have also included the formulas used to calculate the ATP production rate.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Overall, it appears that IGFBP2 does not seem to primarily cause metabolic changes, but simply accelerates the metabolic dependency on OXPHOS. Hence, the term 'metabolic remodelling' must be avoided unless IGFBP2 depletion/loss of function analysis is shown.</p></disp-quote><p>We thank the reviewer for suggesting how to interpret the data about the dependency on OXPHOS. We have now changed the conclusions and claims about the effect of IGFBP2. We have also included a cell cycle analysis of the hematopoietic cells derived upon IGFBP2 addition to show that they don’t show differences in proliferation that could cause the increase in colony formation we observed. Regarding the assay, we have plated the same number of cells for each group to make sure we were comparing the same number of cells, which we also assessed in the microscope before the test, and we eliminated the suspension cells during the washes that preceded the measurement. The review is correct in indicating that there is a basal difference in the value of OCR and ECAR where the IGFBP2 is lower at the start and not higher, which would not conceal higher proliferation. Finally, the ATP production rate is calculated on the variation of OCR and ECAR upon the addition of inhibitors, which normalizes for the basal differences.</p></body></sub-article></article>
