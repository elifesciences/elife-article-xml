A common approach to countering the effects of the stress is to import compatible solutes such as glycine betaine, leading to simultaneous passive water fluxes following the osmotic gradient. OpuA from <italic>Lactococcus lactis</italic> is a type I ABC-importer that uses two substrate-binding domains (SBDs) to capture extracellular glycine betaine and deliver the substrate to the transmembrane domains for subsequent transport. OpuA senses osmotic stress via changes in the internal ionic strength and is furthermore regulated by the 2nd messenger cyclic-di-AMP. We now show, by means of solution-based single-molecule FRET and analysis with multi-parameter photon-by-photon hidden Markov modeling, that the SBDs transiently interact in an ionic strength-dependent manner. The smFRET data are in accordance with the apparent cooperativity in transport and supported by new cryo-EM data of OpuA. We propose that the physical interactions between SBDs and cooperativity in substrate delivery are part of the transport mechanism.</p></abstract><kwd-group kwd-group-type="author-keywords"><kwd>ABC importer</kwd><kwd>osmoregulatory transporter</kwd><kwd>single-molecule FRET</kwd><kwd>single-particle cryo-EM</kwd><kwd>interdomain dynamics</kwd><kwd>transient protein-protein interactons</kwd></kwd-group><kwd-group kwd-group-type="research-organism"><title>Research organism</title><kwd>Other</kwd></kwd-group><funding-group><award-group id="fund1"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100003246</institution-id><institution>Nederlandse Organisatie voor Wetenschappelijk Onderzoek</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>Gravitation Program BaSyC</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Poolman</surname><given-names>Bert</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund2"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100003246</institution-id><institution>Nederlandse Organisatie voor Wetenschappelijk Onderzoek</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>722.017.001</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Paulino</surname><given-names>Cristina</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund3"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100003246</institution-id><institution>Nederlandse Organisatie voor Wetenschappelijk Onderzoek</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>40.018.016</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Paulino</surname><given-names>Cristina</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund4"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100003246</institution-id><institution>Nederlandse Organisatie voor Wetenschappelijk Onderzoek</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>OCENW.KLEIN.526</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Paulino</surname><given-names>Cristina</given-names></name><name><surname>Poolman</surname><given-names>Bert</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><funding-statement>The funders had no role in study design, data collection and interpretation, or the decision to submit the work for publication.</funding-statement></funding-group><custom-meta-group><custom-meta specific-use="meta-only"><meta-name>Author impact statement</meta-name><meta-value>Transient and weak interactions between the substrate-binding proteins of the ATP-binding cassette transporter OpuA can influence the transport efficiency.</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta specific-use="meta-only"><meta-name>publishing-route</meta-name><meta-value>prc</meta-value></custom-meta></custom-meta-group></article-meta></front><body><sec id="s1" sec-type="intro"><title>Introduction</title><p>All cells undergo passive fluxes of water into and out of the cell due to the semipermeable nature of biological membranes. This makes osmotic challenges a universal stress factor. Cells compensate the passive outward flux of water by accumulating compatible solutes and thereby rehydrate the cytoplasm during osmotic stress. Bacteria commonly accumulate zwitterionic compatible solutes such as glycine betaine, carnitine, TMAO and or proline (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Bremer and KrÃ¤mer, 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Hoffmann and Bremer, 2017</xref>). The import of compatible solutes induces an inflow of water that can compensate for an increase in external osmolality, thereby restoring turgor and physicochemical homeostasis of the cytoplasm (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib61">Stadmiller et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Bounedjah et al., 2012</xref>). Compatible solute importers, sense physical properties like ionic strength or specific ion concentrations to regulate their import activity immediately in response to osmotic stress (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib67">van der Heide et al., 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib56">Sikkema et al., 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib63">Tantirimudalige et al., 2022</xref>). The import of compatible solutes must be tightly regulated since overaccumulation can be equally lethal, causing detrimental hydrostatic pressure leading to cell lysis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Commichau et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib41">Pham et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib62">StÃ¼lke and KrÃ¼ger, 2020</xref>). Hence, additional regulatory mechanisms can be present to control the flux of osmolytes. The second messenger cyclic-di-AMP acts as a backstop to prevent overaccumulation of compatible solutes and K<sup>+</sup> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib56">Sikkema et al., 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Commichau et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib41">Pham et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib62">StÃ¼lke and KrÃ¼ger, 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib53">Schuster et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib44">Quintana et al., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Corrigan et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Gundlach et al., 2015</xref>). The importance of this regulatory mechanism is highlighted by the fact that cyclic-di-AMP is both essential and toxic at elevated concentrations (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib62">StÃ¼lke and KrÃ¼ger, 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Gundlach et al., 2015</xref>). This property makes the protein network associated with cyclic-di-AMP sensing, synthesis and breakdown valuable for finding new antimicrobial therapeutics (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Dey et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib40">Opoku-Temeng and Sintim, 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">Neumann et al., 2023</xref>).</p><p>OpuA from <italic>Lactococcus lactis</italic> is one of the best-studied compatible solute importers. The activity and expression of OpuA are increased by ionic strength, and are inhibited by cyclic-di-AMP (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib67">van der Heide et al., 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib56">Sikkema et al., 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib41">Pham et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib49">Romeo et al., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Mahmood et al., 2006</xref>). OpuA belongs to the type I subfamily of ABC-importers. It is a tetrameric protein complex consisting of two different types of subunits: two cytosolic OpuAA proteins consisting of a nucleotide-binding domain (NBD) and a cyclic-di-AMP-sensing (CBS) domain, and two OpuABC proteins, consisting of a transmembrane domain (TMD), a scaffold domain and an extracellular single substrate-binding domain (SBD; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1A</xref>). The NBDs hydrolyze ATP to fuel transport and sense ionic strength through interactions of a cationic helix-turn-helix motif with the negatively charged membrane (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib56">Sikkema et al., 2020</xref>). The SBD is a two-lobed protein that binds glycine betaine with micromolar affinity and delivers it to the transporting unit. In contrast to the covalently linked SBDs found in OpuA, substrate binding units in many other ABC importers are expressed as an independent soluble or lipid-anchored protein, called then a substrate-binding protein (SBP; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib68">van der Heide and Poolman, 2002</xref>).</p><fig-group><fig id="fig1" position="float"><label>Figure 1.</label><caption><title>Experimental approach for measuring interdomain dynamics in the SBDs of OpuA.</title><p>(<bold>A</bold>) A cryo-EM structure of OpuA (PDB: 7AHH).

In the case of type I ABC-importers, pioneering studies have been performed on the maltose and histidine import systems, MalFGK<sub>2</sub>-E and HisQMP<sub>2</sub>, respectively. In both transporters, the soluble substrate-loaded SBP (MalE or HisQ) is needed to fully stimulate ATPase activity, although the SBP can also bind the TMDs and slightly stimulate ATPase activity in the absence of substrate (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">MÃ¤chtel et al., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Chen, 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Heuveling et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib59">Sippach et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Ames et al., 1996</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Bao and Duong, 2012</xref>). The binding of MalE to the TMDs is tight in the presence of inhibiting nucleotides and goes through cycles of docking and release under transport conditions (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Bao and Duong, 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Chen et al., 2001</xref>). There are no indications that either the MalE or HisQ proteins cooperate together. In fact, empty MalE SBPs and SBDs from the amino acid importer GlnPQ have been shown to compete with their substrate-bound equivalents for binding to the TMDs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">Merino et al., 1995</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Gouridis et al., 2015</xref>).</p><p>In contrast to MalE SBP and the SBDs of GlnPQ, the two SBDs in OpuA act cooperatively during transport. The cooperativity increases the import efficiency to overcome osmotic stress as quickly as possible (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Biemans-Oldehinkel and Poolman, 2003</xref>). Despite the beauty of the cooperative mechanism, the molecular basis for the cooperativity in OpuA remains unresolved. On the contrary, MalE from <italic>E. coli</italic>, ProX from <italic>Synechococcus spp</italic>., ArtJ from <italic>Thermatoga maritima</italic>, and the SBPs TakP and TM0322 from the family of tripartite ATP-independent periplasmic (TRAP) transporters can form dimers in solution, but there is no data on the functional role of the dimeric states (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Cuneo et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Gonin et al., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib46">Richarme, 1983</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Ford et al., 2022</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">Luchansky et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib50">Ruggiero et al., 2014</xref>).

The time resolution of solution-based smFRET is generally limited by the time that the protein resides in the confocal volume of the laser, which is usually in the millisecond range. However, the new analysis tool multi-parameter photon-by-photon hidden Markov modeling (mpH2MM) enables to study different states of the protein within a single burst (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Harris et al., 2022</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib42">Pirchi et al., 2016</xref>).

The positions of the cysteines do not interfere with docking of the SBDs to the TMDs, and they do not affect the transport. We further improved the purification, nanodisc reconstitution and labeling of OpuA to obtain a sample suitable for single-molecule studies. Next, we studied the dynamics of the SBDs in OpuA with sub-millisecond time resolution. The observed dynamics were complemented by new structural data of OpuA obtained by cryo-EM.</p></sec><sec id="s2" sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><sec id="s2-1"><title>Optimization of OpuA purification and nanodisc reconstitution</title><p>Previously, a protocol for the purification of OpuA and subsequent reconstitution in MSP-based nanodiscs was used to obtain cryo-EM structures of the protein complex. This protocol was suitable for obtaining high-resolution 3D-images, but the size-exclusion chromatography (SEC) profile showed that the nanodisc sample consisted of protein complexes with different molecular weights (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1B</xref>). The resolution of the Superdex 200 Increase 10/300 column is not high enough to fully separate the different macromolecular species. Based on SDS-PAGE and electron microscopy analyses, the first peak in the SEC profile corresponds to OpuA-containing lipid structures that are distinct from OpuA nanodiscs (second peak) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Karasawa et al., 2013</xref>). The second peak has both subunits of OpuA (OpuAA and OpuABC) in the nanodiscs. The third peak represents OpuA nanodiscs with one or two OpuAA subunits lost. The fourth peak consists of lipid nanodiscs lacking any OpuA components (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1C</xref>). Because the first three peaks overlap, it was not possible to obtain monodisperse OpuA nanodiscs. This is acceptable for cryo-EM studies but complicates the analysis of protein dynamics by smFRET. Therefore, we optimized the purification and reconstitution on various aspects, and we were able to achieve monodisperse OpuA nanodiscs (see Materials and methods; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1B and D</xref>). The new procedure yielded OpuA nanodiscs with similar glycine betaine-, KCl-, and ATP-dependent activity profiles as before (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1âfigure supplement 1</xref>). Furthermore, the absolute activity was constant between different replicates and was not reduced after storage at â80 Â°C.</p></sec><sec id="s2-2"><title>Purification and labeling of OpuA cysteine variants</title><p>smFRET is a powerful tool for studying membrane protein dynamics (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Lerner et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Bartels et al., 2021</xref>). In order to study single-molecule dynamics of OpuA, we made use of thiol-reactive, maleimide-based donor and acceptor fluorophores Alexa Fluor 555 and Alexa Fluor 647, respectively, that were linked to engineered cysteines in natively cys-less OpuA. We record fluorescent bursts of a few milliseconds in duration, which come from single molecules that transit through the focal spot of a confocal microscope (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1E and F</xref>). Every molecule gets excited by a pulsed laser that alternates between a donor and an acceptor excitation wavelength at a pulse rate of 40 MHz. Consequently, every molecule gets excited many times. The relative fluorescent intensity of the fluorophores after excitation of the donor is used to calculate an apparent FRET efficiency for each burst (E*). The real FRET efficiency (E) is obtained by applying the usual correction factors (see Materials and methods). The fluorescence after excitation of the acceptor is used together with the total fluorescence after donor excitation to calculate a stoichiometry (S) of fluorescence. The Python-based package FRETbursts was used to filter out molecules that were labeled with only donor (Sâ1) or only acceptor (Sâ0) fluorophores (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s1">Figure 2âfigure supplement 1</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Ingargiola et al., 2016b</xref>).</p><p>Several double-cysteine variants have been constructed in a soluble variant of the SBD (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib57">Sikkema and Poolman, 2021</xref>).

Since full-length OpuA consists of two identical OpuABC and two OpuAA proteins, a single cysteine was introduced per SBD (OpuABC) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1A and E</xref>). We used the positions Lys-521 and Asn-414 to introduce single cysteine mutations in the full-length transporter. These variants are used to study inter-SBD dynamics in the FRET range of 3â10 nm (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1E</xref>).</p><p>Both mutants purified very well and retained full ATPase activity in the presence of 1 mM DTT (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1âfigure supplement 1</xref>).

Theoretically, the non-docked SBDs can sample inter-domain distances that would cover the entire FRET range from 3 to 10 nm, with low FRET values corresponding to long distances, whereas high FRET values are indicative of shorter distances. The mobility of the undocked SBDs will be higher than the diffusion of the whole complex, allowing the sampling of varying interdomain distances within a single burst. However, these dynamic variations are subsequently averaged to a singular FRET value during FRET calculations for each burst, and may appear as a single low FRET state in the FRET histograms.</p><p>Both OpuA-N414C and OpuA-K521C were first analyzed in a high salt condition without substrate or Mg-ATP (50 mM HEPES-K pH 7.0, 600 mM KCl). As expected, most FRET bursts fall within a low-FRET population when OpuA is in the apo state (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2A and B</xref>; upper panels). However, the FRET distributions tail towards higher FRET values, especially in OpuA-K521C. We performed a burst variance analysis (BVA) to qualitatively assess if the broad FRET distribution represents different fixed states or a mixture of states that can alternate within a single burst (see Materials and methods; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib65">Torella et al., 2011</xref>). A large part of the FRET population exhibits within-burst dynamics, which was higher than expected from shot noise alone (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2A and B</xref>; third panel). We then analyzed the data by multi-parameter photon-by-photon hidden Markov modeling (mpH2MM; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Harris et al., 2022</xref>). This new approach uses raw photon data from both donor and acceptor excitation periods to find the number of hidden Markov states that best describe the data. A Viterbi algorithm identifies the optimal state path within bursts. Each state within a burst is then considered separately as a dwell (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1F</xref>).</p><fig-group><fig id="fig2" position="float"><label>Figure 2.</label><caption><title>The SBDs of OpuA sample two dynamic FRET states.</title><p>The proteins were analyzed in 50 mM HEPES-K pH 7.0, 600 mM KCl with the following additions: (<bold>A</bold>) OpuA-N414C without further additions.

Two of the four states represent donor-only (Sâ1) or acceptor-only (Sâ0) dwells. The full bursts belonging to donor-only and acceptor-only molecules were excluded prior to mpH2MM. This means that some molecules transit to a donor-only or acceptor-only state within the burst period, which most likely reflects blinking or bleaching of one of the fluorophores. These donor-only and acceptor-only states were also excluded during further analysis. The other two states reflect genuine FRET dwells that were analyzed by mpH2MM. They represent different conformations of the SBDs. In other words, the SBDs do not only freely diffuse in the absence of substrate and Mg-ATP (most likely represented by the low-FRET state with a high burst variance), but they also adopt a conformation where they move closer together. The transition rate constants from the high- to the low-FRET state was 193 s<sup>â1</sup> for OpuA-N414C and 173 s<sup>â1</sup> for OpuA-K521C. This is in the range of a burst size of 5â10ms and indicates that some proteins moved from one state to the other while being excited in the confocal volume. This also explains at least a part of the elevated burst variance in the BVA plots. Within-burst transitions from low- to high-FRET were less frequent than those from high- to low-FRET, making the estimated transition rate constants below 100 s<sup>â1</sup> less accurate.</p><p>Assuming that the low-FRET state represents a situation where the SBDs diffuse freely, we note that the mean FRET efficiency for OpuA-K521C is higher (0.18) than for OpuA-N414C (0.10). Position 414 is located farther from the transmembrane helix that anchors the SBD to the transporter. Hence, N414C has a larger sampling space and the two dyes can move farther apart, which explains the difference in mean FRET efficiency between OpuA-K521C and OpuA-N414C.</p></sec><sec id="s2-4"><title>SBD dynamics under turnover conditions</title><p>OpuA transports glycine betaine in the presence of Mg-ATP and at high ionic strength. The transport-competent docking of the SBD onto the TMDs has been resolved by cryo-EM in a pre-hydrolysis state by using Mg-ATP and glycine betaine in combination with the E190Q mutation, which prevents OpuA from hydrolyzing ATP (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib56">Sikkema et al., 2020</xref>).

For OpuA-N414C, the high-FRET state got less populated but did not shift (<xref ref-type="table" rid="table3">Table 3</xref>). It was hard to estimate the mean FRET efficiency of this state because of the low number of dwells. Nonetheless, it is clear that the changes in the FRET state are not likely to reflect a change in docking, since the same effect is observed when Mg-ATP is present without glycine betaine (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2D</xref>).</p><table-wrap id="table2" position="float"><label>Table 2.</label><caption><title>The FRET (E) and Stoichiometry (S) of the FRET states of OpuA-K521C, their relative abundance and the transition rate constants between the states.</title><p><supplementary-material id="table2sdata1"><label>Table 2âsource data 1.</label><caption><title>Burst variance analysis and mpH2MM of the FRET bursts of OpuA-K521C (variants) in different buffers.</title><p>(A) From top to bottom: (1) Burst variance analysis of the bursts which were corrected by the leakage, crosstalk, and Î³-correction factors and which were selected after removing donor-only and acceptor-only bursts.

Each valine-149 located on the TMD of the two OpuABC subunits interacts with a different lobe of a single docked SBD. V149Q was designed as a mild mutation that would reduce docking efficiency and thereby substrate loading, but leave the ionic strength sensing in the NBD and the binding of glycine betaine and ATP intact. Accordingly, a reduced docking efficiency should result in a lower absolute glycine betaine-dependent ATPase activity. At the same time the responsiveness of the system to varying KCl, glycine betaine, or Mg-ATP concentrations should not change. OpuA-V149Q-K521C exhibited a two- to three-fold reduction in glycine betaine-dependent ATPase activity, whereas the futile hydrolysis of ATP in the absence of substrate was unaffected (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3B</xref>). The glycine betaine-dependent ATPase activities of wild type OpuA and OpuA-V149Q-K521C are comparable when they are plotted relative to their maximal activities (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3C</xref>).

However, this was not accompanied by a change in FRET or an increase in the transition rate constant from low- to high-FRET, but rather a decrease in the transition rate constant from high- to low-FRET (<xref ref-type="table" rid="table3">Table 3</xref>). Assuming that the high-FRET states in OpuA-K521C and OpuA-N414C are a result of the same conformation, this could mean that there is more conformational flexibility across different conditions between the two Cys-521 positions than between the Cys-414 positions.</p><p>Notably, in contrast to many other ABC transporters, the SBDs are covalently linked to the TMD. Thus, the movement of the SBDs in OpuA is constrained by a short linker consisting of only 11 amino acids and a hydrophobic transmembrane anchoring sequence. These sequences are not conserved among species within the same order of Lactobacillales, and the linker sequence is not predicted to form any secondary structure (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s1">Figure 4âfigure supplement 1</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Drozdetskiy et al., 2015</xref>). The backbone of a polypeptide in its extended conformation spans ~0.35 nm per amino acid and the radius of the SBD is around 2 nm (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib54">Schuurman-Wolters et al., 2018</xref>). Assuming that the position of the linker at the membrane is fixed, each SBD has a mere sampling space of half a sphere with a radius of about 5.9 nm. Hence, the apparent concentration of an SBD in this volume is 4 mM. With the sampling space overlapping, the two SBDs experience each other at millimolar concentrations (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4C</xref>). Weak intermolecular interactions are sufficient for binding at millimolar concentration. The high-FRET state may thus reflect a dimeric state of the SBDs. A known procedure to overcome weak interactions at high protein concentrations is the addition of charged amino acids (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib51">Schneider et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Golovanov et al., 2004</xref>). Therefore, we tested the dynamic behavior of OpuA-K521C in 50 mM HEPES pH 7.0, 600 mM KCl supplemented with 50 mM arginine plus 50 mM glutamate. The amino acids changed the high-FRET state to a mean FRET efficiency of 0.55 but did not prevent the presence of this state (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4A</xref>; <xref ref-type="table" rid="table2">Table 2</xref>). Also, the high-FRET state is observed not only in HEPES but also in BIS-TRIS buffer (<xref ref-type="table" rid="table2">Table 2</xref>).</p><p>smFRET was also performed in the absence of KCl and with a saturating concentration of glycine betaine (100 ÂµM). The mean FRET efficiency of the high-FRET state of OpuA-K521C increased to 0.78, which corresponds to an inter-dye distance of about 4 nm. This indicates that the dyes at the two SBDs move very close towards each other (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4A</xref>; <xref ref-type="table" rid="table2">Table 2</xref>). It also shows that the high-FRET state can be sensitive to the conformation of the SBD. In high-salt conditions plus Mg-ATP, glycine betaine does not induce a significant FRET shift, indicating that the high-FRET state under high-salt conditions is not affected by SBD closing. Taken together, these data show that the high-FRET state is present in both the open-unliganded and closed-liganded states of the SBDs.</p></sec><sec id="s2-7"><title>Direct interactions between SBDs observed by single particle cryo-EM</title><p>Recent advances in both hardware and software for single-particle cryo-EM have drastically improved the resolution of protein structures, and they also provided the capability to sample the dynamic conformational landscape of proteins at a given condition. More specifically, during image processing, single particles of various orientations are aligned and their signal is combined, resulting in a 3D density map that represents their average state. Depending on the degree of flexibility, the signal of individual domains can align (static) or be averaged out (inherently flexible). The latter is what we anticipated for the SBDs of OpuA, but such low-resolution data can still provide invaluable information and serve to complement smFRET data. While they might not allow to unambiguously model the atomic structure of a protein domain, they reveal its predominant relative localization relative to the rest of the protein complex.</p><p>To gain insight on the interaction between the SBDs, cryo-EM datasets of full-length wild type OpuA were collected in two low ionic strength conditions (20 mM HEPES-K pH 7.0, supplemented with 50 mM or 100 mM KCl). After several rounds of classification (2D, 3D) and refinement, EM maps aligned at 6.2 and 7 Ã, with particle stacks of 166,066 and 80,348, respectively (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s2">Figure 4âfigure supplements 2</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s3">3</xref>). Due to the inherent flexibility of the SBDs, with respect to both the MSP protein of the nanodisc and the TMDs of OpuA, their resolution is limited. Furthermore, the cryo-EM reconstructions average all the particles in the final dataset, including those with a low and high FRET state. Nevertheless, in both conditions, the densities that correspond to the SBDs can be observed in close proximity (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4D</xref>). The distance between the density centers is 6 nm and align with the dimensions of an SBD, providing further evidence for physical interactions between the SBDs.</p><p>In contrast, the density derived from single particle analysis of wild type OpuA in higher ionic strength (50 mM KPi pH 7.0, supplemented with 200 mM KCl), as described by <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib56">Sikkema et al., 2020</xref>, reveals an overall more distant localization of the SBDs with respect to each other (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4D</xref>, left). When super-positioned, the three maps reveal a significant difference in the localization of the SBDs (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4D</xref>, right). Given the flexibility and limited resolution, the nature of their interaction cannot be structurally characterized, but the cryo-EM data corroborate with the smFRET data.</p></sec></sec><sec id="s3" sec-type="discussion"><title>Discussion</title><p>The study of transient interdomain interactions in membrane-embedded proteins is challenging. Membrane proteins are unstable outside their native lipid environment and transient interactions are very hard to capture by cryo-EM or other biophysical techniques. We used smFRET to investigate the dynamics between the two SBDs of OpuA, which are covalently linked to the two TMDs in the transporter complex. The smFRET-compatible OpuA-K521C and OpuA-N414C are fully functional in ATP-, KCl-, and glycine betaine-dependent ATP hydrolysis when reconstituted into lipid nanodiscs. The majority of the recorded FRET bursts are present in a low-FRET state but exhibit within-burst dynamics according to a burst variance analysis (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2</xref>; third panel). The bursts in the low-FRET state suggests that the protein has more than one FRET state, which are averaged out due to the limited temporal resolution of solution-based confocal microscopy. Further analysis of the data by a hidden Markov modeling approach (mpH2MM) indeed revealed a second state with a higher mean FRET efficiency and a lifetime of less than 10ms in most conditions. This is in the same range as the length of a single burst. Thus, the SBDs of OpuA not only reside in a freely diffusing low-FRET state but also in a high-FRET state where the SBDs are close to each other.</p><p>In many type I ABC importers, the SBD is expressed as a separate polypeptide, called SBP. SBPs diffuse in 3D in the bacterial periplasm or in 2D along the membrane surface, that is when they are membrane-anchored via a lipid moiety. It has been shown for several SBPs that they can dock onto the TMDs in the open-unliganded and closed-liganded states (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Ames et al., 1996</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Bao and Duong, 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Chen et al., 2001</xref>). Likewise, the high-FRET state could represent a state in which one of the two SBDs is docked and the other SBD is located close by. Therefore, OpuA-V149Q was designed to reduce the docking efficiency of the SBDs in OpuA (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3</xref>). Because the relative distributions of the two FRET states are the same in OpuA-V149Q and wild type OpuA, we conclude that the high-FRET state does not represent a docked state (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3D</xref>; <xref ref-type="table" rid="table2">Table 2</xref>).</p><p>Using the ATP-hydrolysis defective OpuA-E190Q, we have previously shown by cryo-EM that glycine betaine plus Mg-ATP stabilize a docked state of one of the SBDs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib56">Sikkema et al., 2020</xref>). In smFRET measurements, glycine betaine plus Mg-ATP induced a shift in the mean FRET efficiency of the high-FRET states of both OpuA-K521C and OpuA-E190Q-K521C (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2C</xref>; <xref ref-type="table" rid="table2">Table 2</xref>). This could indicate that a docked state is induced, which has replaced the previous high-FRET state. However, for OpuA-N414C we do not observe a shift but a reduction in the amount of dwells in the high-FRET state. Moreover, the addition of Mg-ATP alone induces similar shifts or changes in the relative amounts of the states. Therefore, it is not likely that the shift in the high-FRET state of OpuA-K521C represents a docked state of an SBD. We conclude that the spatial resolution of smFRET is not sufficient to study docking by looking at SBD-SBD distance dynamics.</p><p>We have shown that the SBDs of OpuA come close together in a short-lived state, which is responsive to the addition of glycine betaine (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4A</xref>). Although the occurrence of the state varies between different conditions, it was not possible to negate the high-FRET state completely, not even under very high or low KCl concentrations, or in the presence of 50 mM arginine plus 50 mM glutamate (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4A and B</xref>). To evaluate possible scenarios of interdomain interactions we consider the following: (1) The SBDs of OpuA are connected to the TMDs with very short linkers of approximately 4 nm, which limit their movement and allow the receptor to sample a relatively small volume near its docking site. (2) in low ionic strength condition OpuA-K521C displays a high FRET state with mean FRET values of 0.7â0.8, which corresponds to inter-dye distances of approximately 4 nm. (3) The high FRET state is responsive to glycine betaine, which points toward direct communication between the two SBDs. (4) The distance between the density centers of the SBDs in the cryo-EM reconstructions (based on particles with a low and high FRET state) is 6 nm, which aligns with the dimensions of an SBD (length: ~6 nm, maximal width: ~4 nm). These findings collectively indicate that two SBDs interact but not necessarily in a singular conformation but possibly as an ensemble of weakly interacting states. Hence, we discuss three possible SBD-SBD interaction models to explain the high-FRET state:</p><p>Firstly, the SBDs do not physically interact but bind simultaneously to the TMDs (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5A</xref>). Note that OpuA forms a homodimeric complex and one SBD could potentially bind to one half of the membrane-embedded transporter unit, while the other binds to the other half. This type of docking would be very different from the transport-competent state that we previously observed by cryo-EM. We find this possibility unlikely because transport-competent docking would reduce the presence of the high-FRET state, which is not what we find. Moreover, we do not observe any indication for such a state by cryo-EM in 50 mM HEPES-K pH 7.0, 50 mM KCl, whereas the high-FRET state is prominent in this condition. More specifically, a transport-competent docking would drastically reduce the flexibility of the SBDs, increasing the local resolution in the cryo-EM maps.</p><fig id="fig5" position="float"><label>Figure 5.</label><caption><title>Schematic of possible states of the SBDs of OpuA.</title><p>(<bold>A</bold>) Both SBDs dock in a non-productive manner onto the TMDs. (<bold>B</bold>) The SBDs interact with each other in an upright orientation either back-to-back, front-to-front or front-to-back. (<bold>C</bold>) The SBDs interact sideways with each other.</p></caption><graphic mimetype="image" mime-subtype="tiff" xlink:href="elife-90996-fig5-v1.tif"/></fig><p>Secondly, the SBDs interact with each other in an upright orientation, either back-to-back, front-to-front, back-to-front or something in between (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5</xref>). For back-to-back and back-to-front conformations, the distance between the cysteines would be less than 4 nm in both OpuA-K521C and OpuA-N414C. This cannot explain the mean FRET efficiency of the high-FRET state in both OpuA variants, which would correspond to 4.1 nm for OpuA-K521C and 4.9 nm for OpuA-N414C in the conditions with the highest mean FRET (assuming a FÃ¶rster distance (R<sub>0</sub>) of 0.51) (<xref ref-type="table" rid="table2 table3">Tables 2 and 3</xref>). Moreover, both situations would reduce the rotational freedom of the fluorophores on the back of the SBD and hence their steady-state anisotropy, especially in the absence of KCl when the high-FRET state is more populated. However, the steady-state anisotropy is not different for conditions with 0 mM and 300 mM KCl (<xref ref-type="table" rid="table4">Table 4</xref>). A front-to-front conformation could reflect the observed mean FRET efficiency and at the same time would not interfere with the rotational freedom of the fluorophores. However, this conformation would not be able to dock. Since the high-FRET state is short-lived, docking should reduce the prevalence of this state, which is not what we observe (<xref ref-type="table" rid="table2 table3">Tables 2 and 3</xref>).</p><table-wrap id="table4" position="float"><label>Table 4.</label><caption><title>Steady-state anisotropy values of free dyes and dyes which were attached to different proteins.</title></caption><table frame="hsides" rules="groups"><thead><tr><th align="left" valign="bottom"/><th align="left" valign="bottom">Condition<xref ref-type="table-fn" rid="table4fn1">*</xref></th><th align="left" valign="bottom">Alexa Fluor 555<xref ref-type="table-fn" rid="table4fn2"><sup>â </sup></xref></th><th align="left" valign="bottom">Alexa Fluor 647<xref ref-type="table-fn" rid="table4fn2"><sup>â </sup></xref></th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td align="left" valign="bottom">Free dye</td><td align="left" valign="bottom">50 mM KCl</td><td align="left" valign="bottom">0.21</td><td align="left" valign="bottom">0.16</td></tr><tr><td align="left" valign="bottom">Free dye</td><td align="left" valign="bottom">300 mM KCl</td><td align="left" valign="bottom">0.21</td><td align="left" valign="bottom">0.16</td></tr><tr><td align="left" valign="bottom">MalE-T36C-S352C</td><td align="left" valign="bottom">300 mM KCl</td><td align="left" valign="bottom">0.26</td><td align="left" valign="bottom">0.22</td></tr><tr><td align="left" valign="bottom">OpuA-K521C</td><td align="left" valign="bottom">50 mM KCl</td><td align="left" valign="bottom">0.30</td><td align="left" valign="bottom">0.28</td></tr><tr><td align="left" valign="bottom">OpuA-K521C</td><td align="left" valign="bottom">300 mM KCl</td><td align="left" valign="bottom">0.29</td><td align="left" valign="bottom">0.27</td></tr><tr><td align="left" valign="bottom">OpuA-N414C</td><td align="left" valign="bottom">50 mM KCl</td><td align="left" valign="bottom">0.28</td><td align="left" valign="bottom">0.24</td></tr><tr><td align="left" valign="bottom">OpuA-N414C</td><td align="left" valign="bottom">300 mM KCl</td><td align="left" valign="bottom">0.28</td><td align="left" valign="bottom">0.23</td></tr></tbody></table><table-wrap-foot><fn id="table4fn1"><label>*</label><p>All conditions contained 50 mM HEPES-K pH 7.0.</p></fn><fn id="table4fn2"><label>â </label><p>Standard deviation between triplicates was less than 0.001.</p></fn></table-wrap-foot></table-wrap><p>Thirdly, the SBDs interact sideways (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5C</xref>). In this scenario, the mean FRET efficiency of the high-FRET state can reflect the distance between the fluorophores, the fluorophores would not be restricted in their rotational freedom, and the SBDs would be able to dock onto the TMDs. Furthermore, this would be in line with our cryo-EM data which hint to two flexible SBDs that on average move closer toward each other in low ionic strength conditions. Therefore, we consider this state type to be the most plausible explanation. It is possible that the apparent high concentration of the SBDs induces transient and not very strong interactions, explaining why the FRET can shift between different experimental conditions.</p><p>In other words, the high FRET state may comprise an ensemble of weakly interacting states rather than a singular stable conformation, resembling the quinary structure of proteins. The quinary structure of proteins is typically revealed in highly crowded cellular environments and describes the weak interactions between protein surfaces that contribute to their stability, function, and spatial organization (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Guin and Gruebele, 2019</xref>). Despite the current study being conducted under dilute conditions, the local concentration of SBDs (~4 mM) mimics a densely populated environment and reveal quinary structure.</p><p>SBDs or SBPs that use the same transporter for docking and substrate delivery compete for the same docking site. When different SBDs with varying substrate scopes compete, or when substrate-free docking is prevalent, transport rates can be significantly reduced (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">Merino et al., 1995</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Gouridis et al., 2015</xref>). Interestingly, the SBDs of OpuA cooperate to enhance transport activity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Biemans-Oldehinkel and Poolman, 2003</xref>). The interdomain interactions between SBDs reduce their diffusional freedom and keep them very close to the TMDs. Therefore, we think that the data presented in this paper elegantly explain how the SBDs of OpuA cooperate. The weak interactions between SBDs keep the SBDs closer to the TMDs, which allows for more efficient delivery and transport of glycine betaine. As soon as one SBD has delivered its substrate and is released from the TMDs, the other SBD is in very close proximity to dock onto the TMDs for a second round of transport. The interactions also raise the apparent concentration of the SBDs near the TMDs, increasing the binding propensity of an SBD with the TMDs. This also explains why the V<sub>max</sub> of OpuA with one inactivated and one functional SBD is not different to wild type OpuA, whereas one missing SBD reduces the V<sub>max</sub> twofold (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Biemans-Oldehinkel and Poolman, 2003</xref>).</p><p>In conclusion, the SBDs of OpuA transiently interact in a docking competent conformation, explaining the cooperativity between the SBDs during transport. The conformation of this interaction is not fixed but differs substantially between different conditions. Dimer formation of SBPs has been described for a variety of proteins from different structural clusters of SBPs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Cuneo et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Gonin et al., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib46">Richarme, 1983</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Ford et al., 2022</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">Luchansky et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib50">Ruggiero et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib71">Zheng et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib55">Shi et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib60">Sippel et al., 2011</xref>). It could well be that cooperativity and transient interactions between SBDs is more common than previously anticipated, not only in covalently linked SBDs but also soluble SBPs. It is important to note that the concentration of SBPs in the periplasm of <italic>E. coli</italic> can be in the millimolar range (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">Manson et al., 1985</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib58">Silhavy et al., 1975</xref>), which is comparable to the concentration of SBDs in the OpuA transport complex. The transient and weak interactions between SBDs offer a new perspective on how transport efficiency of proteins can be regulated.</p></sec><sec id="s4" sec-type="materials|methods"><title>Materials

This was done in 1.5 mL Eppendorf tubes to minimize the hazardous air-water interface. The concentration of OpuA after IMAC was generally around 18 Î¼M but always higher than 13 Î¼M. This is necessary, because OpuA is eluted in the presence of 20% (v/v) glycerol. It was aimed to dilute OpuA enough in the reconstitution mixture to get the glycerol content during reconstitution below 7% (v/v) and hence minimize the negative effects of glycerol on the reconstitution efficiency. The lipids were diluted out more than 8 times to reach a concentration of 0.9 mM lipids. This also reduced the total DDM concentration in the reconstitution mixture to below 8 mM, which is necessary to prevent dissociation of OpuAA from the OpuA complex.

A total of 559,491 particles were picked utilizing the PhosaurusNet architecture of crYOLO version 1.8.4 with a pretrained model as described in <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib56">Sikkema et al., 2020</xref> and subsequently extracted in Relion 4.0 with a box size of 256 pixels and downscaled to 2.044 Ã/pixel. Extracted particles were subjected to a round of 2D classifications with a mask of 200 Ã. Selected particles (264,267) were classified in 3D by limiting the E-step size to 7 Ã, regularization parameter T=4 and a mask of 200 Ã. The best three classes (97,369 particles) were selected and re-extracted with a box size of 256 pixels with no downscaling. These particles were subsequently imported into CryoSPARC and subjected to <italic>ab initio</italic> reconstruction and subsequently to hetero refinement. The best classes (80,348 particles) were further refined using non-uniform refinement which resulted in 7 Ã resolution. The final map was low-pass filtered to 15 Ã for comparison.

In contrast to most ABC import systems, the substrate binding protein is fused via a short linker to the transmembrane domain of the transporter. Consequently, this moiety is called the substrate binding domain (SBD). OpuA has been studied in the past in great detail and we have a very detailed knowledge about function, mechanisms of activation and deactivation as well as structure.</p><p>Strengths: Application of smFRET to unravel transient interactions of the SBDs. The method is applied at a superb quality and the data evaluation is excellent.</p><p>Weaknesses: The proposed model is not directly supported by experimental data. Rather alternative models are excluded as they do not fit to the obtained data. However, this is now clearly stated in the manuscript</p></body></sub-article><sub-article article-type="referee-report" id="sa2"><front-stub><article-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.90996.3.sa2</article-id><title-group><article-title>Reviewer #2 (Public Review):</article-title></title-group><contrib-group><contrib contrib-type="author"><anonymous/><role specific-use="referee">Reviewer</role></contrib></contrib-group></front-stub><body><p>Summary:</p><p>In this report the authors used solution-based single-molecule FRET and low resolution cryo-EM to investigate the interactions between the substrate-binding domains of the ABC-importer OpuA from Lactococcus lactis.

We studied how the FRET states change in response to different conditions that correspond to different stages of the transport cycle and how it changes in response to different ionic strengths. Initially, 600 mM KCl was used to study the dynamics of the SBD at high ionic strength. Later in this study, we tested a very wide range of different salt concentrations for OpuA-K521C to get detailed insights into the dynamics of the SBDs over a wide ionic strength range.

However, we purposely did not speculate on this point in the manuscript, because we have limited information on the molecular details of the interaction. As we highlight on page 8, the SBDs experience each other in a very high apparent concentration (millimolar range). This means that the interactions are most likely very weak (low affinity) and not very specific. Such interactions are in the literature referred to as the quinary structure of proteins and they occur at the high macromolecular crowding in the cell and in proteins with tethered domains, and thus at high local concentrations. Such interactions can be screened by high ionic strength. In the revised manuscript, we now present the partially disrupted dimer structure in the context of the quinary structure of a protein (page 11):</p><p>In other words, the high FRET state may comprise an ensemble of weakly interacting states rather than a singular stable conformation, resembling the quinary structure of proteins. The quinary structure of proteins is typically revealed in highly crowded cellular environments and describes the weak interactions between protein surfaces that contribute to their stability, function, and spatial organization (Guin &amp; Gruebele, 2019). Despite the current study being conducted under dilute conditions, the local concentration of SBDs (~4 mM) mimics a densely populated environment and reveal quinary structure.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><list list-type="bullet"><list-item><p>Page 9, second paragraph: according to the EM data processing, only 20% of the particles were used for 3D reconstruction.

In particular when using a very low and therefore generous threshold during automated particle picking, as we did (t=0.01 and t=0.05 for the 50 mM KCl and 100 mM KCl datasets, respectively), the initial set of particles includes a significant amount of false positives â a tradeoff to avoid excluding particles belonging to low populated classes/orientations. It is thus common that more than 50% of âparticlesâ are excluded in the first rounds of 2D classification. In our case, only 30% and 52% of particles were retained after such first clean-up steps. Subsequently, the particle set is further refined, and additional false positives and low-resolution particles are excluded during extensive rounds of 3D classification. We also note that during the final steps, most of the data excluded represents particles of lower quality that do not contribute to a high-resolution, or belong to low population protein conformations. This does not mean that such a population is not physiological relevant. In conclusion, having only 5-20% of the initial automated picked particles contributing to the reconstruction of the final cryo-EM map is common, with the vast majority of excluded particles being false positives.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><list list-type="bullet"><list-item><p>Page 11, third paragraph: the way the proposed model is selected is also my main criticism.

We do not provide direct evidence for a side-ways interaction. However, we have evidence of transient interactions and our data rule out several scenarios of interaction, leaving 5C as the most likely model. This is also the main conclusion of this paper: In conclusion, the SBDs of OpuA transiently interact in a docking competent conformation, explaining the cooperativity between the SBDs during transport. The conformation of this interaction is not fixed but differs substantially between different conditions.</p><p>Because the interaction is very short-lived it was not possible to visualize molecular details of this interaction. We present Figure 5 to hypothesize the most likely type of interaction, since many possibilities can be excluded with the vast amount of presented data. To make our point more clear that we discuss models and rule out several possibilities but not demonstrate a specific interaction between the SBDs, we now write on page 10 (changes marked in bold): We have shown that the SBDs of OpuA come close together in a short-lived state, which is responsive to the addition of glycine betaine (Figure 4A). Although the occurrence of the state varies between different conditions, it was not possible to negate the high-FRET state completely, not even under very high or low KCl concentrations, or in the presence of 50 mM arginine plus 50 mM glutamate (Figure 4A,B). To evaluate possible interdomain interactions scenarios we consider the following: (1) The SBDs of OpuA are connected to the TMDs with very short linkers of approximately 4 nm, which limit their movement and allow the receptor to sample a relatively small volume near its docking site. (2) in low ionic strength condition OpuA-K521C displays a high FRET state with mean FRET values of 0.7-0.8, which correspond to inter-dye distances of approximately 4 nm. (3) The high FRET state is responsive to glycine betaine, which points toward direct communication between the two SBDs. (4) The distance between the density centers of the SBDs in the cryo-EM reconstructions (based on particles with a low and high FRET state) is 6 nm, which aligns with the dimensions of an SBD (length: ~6 nm, maximal width: ~4 nm). These findings collectively indicate that two SBDs interact but not necessarily in a singular conformation but possibly as an ensemble of weakly interacting states. Hence, we discuss three possible SBD-SBD interaction models to explain the highFRET state:</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p><bold>Reviewer #2 (Recommendations For The Authors):</bold></p><p>In the abstract and elsewhere the authors suggest that the SBDs physically interact with one another, and that this interaction is important for the transport mechanism, specifically for its cooperativity.</p><p>I feel that this main claim is not well established. The authors convincingly demonstrate that the SBDs largely occupy two states relative to one another and that in one of these states, they are closer than in the other. Unless I have missed (or failed to understand) some major details of the results, I did not find any evidence of a physical interaction. Have the authors established that the high FRET state indeed corresponds to the physical engagement of the SBDs? I feel that a direct demonstration of an interaction is much missing.</p><p>Along the same lines, in the low-salt cryo-EM structure, where the SBDs are relatively closer together, the SBDs are still separated and do not interact.</p></disp-quote><p>See also our response to the final comment of reviewer 1. Furthermore, please carefully consider the following: (1) FRET values of 0.7-0.8 correspond to inter-dye distances of approximately 4 nm. (2) The high FRET state is responsive to glycine betaine, which points toward direct communication between the two SBDs. (3) The cryo-EM reconstruction is the average of all the particles in the final dataset, including both the particles with a low and high FRET state. Further, the local resolution of the SBDs in the cryo-EM map is low, indicative of high degree of flexibility. Thus, a potential interaction is possible within the observed range of flexibility. (4) The distance between the density centers is 6 nm, aligning with the dimensions of an SBD (length: 6 nm, maximal width: 4 nm). These factors collectively indicate SBD interactions, and we present these points now more explicitly in Figure 4 and the last part of the results section (page 9).</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Once the authors successfully demonstrate that direct physical interaction indeed occurs, they will need to provide data that places it in the context of the transport cycle. Do the SBDs swap ligand molecules between them? Do they bind the ligand and/or the transporter cooperatively? What is the role of this interaction?</p></disp-quote><p>We acknowledge the intriguing nature of the posed questions, but they extend beyond the scope of this study. It is extremely challenging to obtain high-resolution structures of highly dynamic multidomain proteins, like OpuA, and to probe transient interactions as we do here for the SBDs of OpuA. We therefore combined cryo-TEM with smFRET studies and perform the most advanced and state-of-theart analysis tools as acknowledged by reviewer 1. We link our observations on the structural dynamics and interactions of the SBDs to a previous study, where we showed that the two SBDs of OpuA interact cooperatively. We do not have further evidence that connect the physical interactions to the transport cycle. In our view, the collective datasets indicate that the here reported physical interactions between the SBDs increase the transport efficiency.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>As far as I understand, the smFRET data have been interpreted on the basis of a negative observation, i.e., that it is &quot;likely&quot; that none of the FRET states corresponds to a docked SBD. To convincingly show this, a positive observation is required, i.e., observation of a docked state.</p></disp-quote><p>The aim of this study was to study interdomain dynamics and not specifically docking. We have previously shown that docking can be visualized via cryo-EM (Sikkema et al., 2020), however the SBDs of OpuA appear to only dock in specific turnover conditions. We now show that the high FRET state of OpuA cannot represent a docked state, but that the SBDs transiently interact (see our response to the first comment). Importantly, a docked state was also not found in the cryo-EM reconstructions at low ionic strength, representing the smFRET conditions where we observe the interactions between the SBDs. The high FRET state occupies 30% of the dwells in this condition, and such a high percentage of molecules would have become apparent during cryo-EM 3D classification in case they would form a docked state. Therefore, we conclude that docking does not occur in low ionic strength apo condition. We discuss this point and our reasoning on page 11 of the revised manuscript.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>In this respect, I find it troubling that in none of the tested conditions, the authors observed a FRET state which corresponds to the docked state. Such a state, which must exist for transport to occur (as mentioned in the authors' previous publications), needs to be demonstrated. This brings me to my next question: why have the authors not measured FRET between the SBDs and the transporter? Isn't this a very important piece that is missing from their puzzle?</p></disp-quote><p>We agree that investigating docking behavior under varied turnover conditions requires focused experiments on FRET dynamics between the SBDs and the transporter. As noted on page 5, OpuA exists as a homodimer, implying that a single cysteine mutation introduces two cysteines in a single functional transporter. To specifically implement a cysteine mutation in only one SBD and one transmembrane domain, it is necessary to artificially construct a heterodimer. We recently published initial attempts in this direction, and this will be a subject for future research but still requires years of work.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Additionally, I feel that important controls are missing. For example, how will the data presented in Fig1 look if the transporter is labeled with acceptor or donor only? How do soluble SBDs behave?</p></disp-quote><p>In the employed labeling method, donor and acceptor dyes are mixed in a 1:1 ratio and randomly attached to the two cysteines in the transporter. This automatically yields significant fractions of donor only and acceptor only transporters which are always present during the smFRET recordings. We can visualize those molecules on the basis of the dye stoichiometry, which we calculate by using three types of photon counts: donor-based donor emission (FDD), donor-based acceptor emission (FDA) and acceptorbased acceptor emission (FAA).<disp-formula id="sa3equ2"><mml:math id="sa3m2"><mml:mrow><mml:mi>S</mml:mi><mml:mo>=</mml:mo><mml:mfrac><mml:mrow><mml:msub><mml:mi>F</mml:mi><mml:mrow><mml:mi>D</mml:mi><mml:mi>A</mml:mi></mml:mrow></mml:msub><mml:mo>+</mml:mo><mml:msub><mml:mi>F</mml:mi><mml:mrow><mml:mi>D</mml:mi><mml:mi>D</mml:mi></mml:mrow></mml:msub></mml:mrow><mml:mrow><mml:msub><mml:mi>F</mml:mi><mml:mrow><mml:mi>D</mml:mi><mml:mi>A</mml:mi></mml:mrow></mml:msub><mml:mo>+</mml:mo><mml:msub><mml:mi>F</mml:mi><mml:mrow><mml:mi>D</mml:mi><mml:mi>D</mml:mi></mml:mrow></mml:msub><mml:mo>+</mml:mo><mml:msub><mml:mi>F</mml:mi><mml:mrow><mml:mi>A</mml:mi><mml:mi>A</mml:mi></mml:mrow></mml:msub></mml:mrow></mml:mfrac></mml:mrow></mml:math></disp-formula></p><p>Unfiltered plots look as follows (a dataset of OpuA-K521C at 600 mM KCl):</p><fig id="sa3fig1" position="float"><label>Author response image 1.</label><graphic mimetype="image" mime-subtype="tiff" xlink:href="elife-90996-sa3-fig1-v1.tif"/></fig><p>Donor only and acceptor only molecules have a very well discernible stoichiometry of 1 and 0, respectively.

It is not possible to study interdomain dynamics between soluble SBDs by smFRET, because the measurements are carried out at picomolar concentrations (monomeric conditions).

This suggest to us that the phenomenon of interacting substrate-binding proteins could be more common. Moreover, the concentration of maltose-binding protein and other SBPs in the periplasm of Gram-negative bacteria can reach (sub)millimolar concentrations, and low-affinity interactions may play a role not only in membrane protein-tethered SBDs (like in OpuA) but also be important in soluble substrate-receptors.
