However, how m6A levels are regulated during physiological or pathological processes such as virus infections, and the in vivo function of m6A in the intestinal immune defense against virus infections are largely unknown. Here, we uncover a novel antiviral function of m6A modification during rotavirus (RV) infection in small bowel intestinal epithelial cells (IECs). We found that rotavirus infection induced global m6A modifications on mRNA transcripts by down-regulating the m6a eraser ALKBH5. Mice lacking the m6A writer enzymes METTL3 in IECs (<italic>Mettl3</italic>ΔIEC) were resistant to RV infection and showed increased expression of interferons (IFNs) and IFN-stimulated genes (ISGs). Using RNA-sequencing and m6A RNA immuno-precipitation (RIP)-sequencing, we identified IRF7, a master regulator of IFN responses, as one of the primary m6A targets during virus infection. In the absence of METTL3, IECs showed increased <italic>Irf7</italic> mRNA stability and enhanced type I and III IFN expression. Deficiency in IRF7 attenuated the elevated expression of IFNs and ISGs and restored susceptibility to RV infection in <italic>Mettl3</italic>ΔIEC mice. Moreover, the global m6A modification on mRNA transcripts declined with age in mice, with a significant drop from 2 weeks to 3 weeks post birth, which likely has broad implications for the development of intestinal immune system against enteric viruses early in life. Collectively, we demonstrated a novel host m6A-IRF7-IFN antiviral signaling cascade that restricts rotavirus infection in vivo.</p></abstract><kwd-group kwd-group-type="author-keywords"><kwd>m6A</kwd><kwd>virus infection</kwd><kwd>innate immune</kwd><kwd>rotavirus</kwd><kwd>IRF7</kwd></kwd-group><kwd-group kwd-group-type="research-organism"><title>Research organism</title><kwd>Mouse</kwd><kwd>Viruses</kwd></kwd-group><funding-group><award-group id="fund1"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100002367</institution-id><institution>Chinese Academy of Sciences</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>Strategic Priority Research Program (XDB29030101)</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Zhu</surname><given-names>Shu</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund2"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100013290</institution-id><institution>National Key Research and Development Program of China</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>2018YFA0508000</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Zhu</surname><given-names>Shu</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund3"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100001809</institution-id><institution>National Natural Science Foundation of China</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>81822021</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Zhu</surname><given-names>Shu</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund4"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100001809</institution-id><institution>National Natural Science Foundation of China</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>91842105</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Zhu</surname><given-names>Shu</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund5"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100001809</institution-id><institution>National Natural Science Foundation of China</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>31770990</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Zhu</surname><given-names>Shu</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund6"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100001809</institution-id><institution>National Natural Science Foundation of China</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>82061148013</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Zhu</surname><given-names>Shu</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund7"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100001809</institution-id><institution>National Natural Science Foundation of China</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>81821001</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Zhu</surname><given-names>Shu</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><funding-statement>The funders had no role in study design, data collection and interpretation, or the decision to submit the work for publication.</funding-statement></funding-group><custom-meta-group><custom-meta specific-use="meta-only"><meta-name>Author impact statement</meta-name><meta-value>RNA m6A level is dually regulated during RV infection and development, METTL3 deficiency in IECs results in increased resistance to rotaviral infection through reduced m6A modificaitons on <italic>Irf7</italic>.</meta-value></custom-meta></custom-meta-group></article-meta></front><body><sec id="s1" sec-type="intro"><title>Introduction</title><p>N6-methyladenosine (m6A) is the most abundant internal mRNA modification and modulates diverse cellular functions through m6A-related writers, erasers, and readers (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Roundtree et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">Xu et al., 2021</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Chelmicki et al., 2021</xref>). The m6A modification directly recruits m6A-specific proteins of the YT521-B homology (YTH) domain family (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Roundtree et al., 2017</xref>). These proteins mediate the m6A-dependent regulation of pre-mRNA processing, microRNA processing, translation initiation, and mRNA decay (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Roundtree et al., 2017</xref>). In recent works, m6A modifications has been identified in the genomes of RNA viruses and the transcripts of DNA viruses with either a pro-viral or anti-viral role (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">Tsai et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Li et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Hesser et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Imam et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">Ye et al., 2017</xref>). Furthermore, m6A RNA modification-mediated down-regulation of the α-ketoglutarate dehydrogenase (KGDH)-itaconate pathway inhibits viral replication independent of the innate immune response (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Liu, 2019</xref>). According to <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Gao et al., 2020</xref>, m6A modification preserves the self-recognition of endogenous transcripts. Deletion of the m6A writer <italic>Mettl3</italic> decreases the m6A modifications in endogenous retrovirus (ERV) transcripts. The accumulation of ERVs activates pattern recognition receptors (e.g. RIG-I) pathways, resulting in a detrimental interferon response in livers of fetal mice (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Gao et al., 2020</xref>).</p><p>The m6A modification of the enterovirus 71 (EV71) RNA genome is important for viral propagation, and EV71 infection increases the expression of m6A writers in vitro (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Hao et al., 2019</xref>). m6A methyltransferase METTL3 knockdown reduces whereas m6A demethylase FTO knockdown increases EV71 replication (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Hao et al., 2019</xref>). In addition, human cytomegalovirus can upregulate the expression of m6A-related proteins (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Rubio et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">Winkler et al., 2019</xref>). Despite the knowledges about m6A regulation and function during viral infection revealed by these in vitro studies, the regulation of m6A modifications and the specific role of m6A in the antiviral response in vivo, especially in the gastrointestinal tract, remains unclear.</p><p>Rotavirus (RV), a member of the family <italic>Reoviridae</italic>, is a nonenveloped icosahedral-structured virus with 11 segments of double-stranded RNA. Children under the age of five are at high risk of rotavirus infection, which causes severe diarrhea, dehydration, and death (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Crawford et al., 2017</xref>). Rotaviruses encode multiple viral proteins to inhibit innate immune responses by degrading interferon regulatory factors (IRFs) and mitochondrial antiviral-signaling protein (MAVS), thus facilitating efficient virus infection and replication (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Ding et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Barro and Patton, 2007</xref>). The timely induction of an IFN response is key to the host successful control of invading viruses, including RV (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Honda et al., 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Lin et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Pott et al., 2011</xref>).

We did qPCR analysis in mouse epithelial cell line MODE-K and showed the similar results (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s1">Figure 4—figure supplement 1a</xref>). Furthermore, we knock down METTL3, ALKBH5 and FTO in MODE-K cell. Through dot blot assay, we found ALKBH5 but not FTO is the dominant m6A eraser in IECs (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s1">Figure 4—figure supplement 1</xref>). Furthermore, overexpressing of recombinant ALKBH5 increased the IFN/ISGs response and inhibit RRV infection in mouse IEC MODE-K cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s2">Figure 4—figure supplement 2</xref>), suggesting re-expression of ALKBH5 might overcome the immune evasion of RV.</p><p>Non-structural protein 1 (NSP1) is a well-established RV-encoded innate immune antagonist that are showed to degrade IRF3 and β-Trcp (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Barro and Patton, 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Ding et al., 2016</xref>).

We infected HEK293 cells with WT and NSP1-null RVs, only WT RV reduced ALKBH5 protein levels (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4f</xref>), suggesting that the down-regulation of ALKBH5 expression by RV is NSP1-dependent. These results suggest that RV might evades the antiviral immune response via downregulation of ALKBH5 expression by NSP1.</p></sec></sec><sec id="s3" sec-type="discussion"><title>Discussion</title><p>Previous studies reported that m6A modifications on mRNA in mice embryonic fibroblasts or normal human dermal fibroblasts negatively regulate the IFN response by accelerating the mRNA degradation of type I IFNs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Rubio et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">Winkler et al., 2019</xref>). However, these studies were mainly conducted in vitro, leaving the relationship between m6A and IFN pathway in vivo an unexplored territory. Since type I and type III IFNs play a critical role in the antiviral immune response in the GI tract (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Pott et al., 2011</xref>), we used an RV infection model, in which IECs are specifically infected, as well as conditional knockout mice with IECs-specific depletion of m6A writer METTL3 or m6A eraser ALKBH5, to study the role of m6A modification in regulating IFN response towards rotavirus in IECs. Using RNA-seq and m6A-seq techniques, we identified IRF7, a key transcription factor upstream of IFNs and ISGs, as one of the m6A modified targets during RV infection, and is essential to mediate the elevated anti-rotavirus immune response by METTL3 deficiency. These results identify <italic>Irf7</italic> as an important m6A target, and characterize, for the first time, the regulation of IFN response during RV infection in intestine, enabling a better understanding of how m6A modifications on mRNA regulate antiviral innate immune responses.</p><p>In addition to directly regulating target genes that involved in innate immune pathways, m6A modification is also known to affect viral gene expression, replication, and generation of progeny virions (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Roundtree et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Brocard et al., 2017</xref>). Some viral RNA genomes are modified by m6A, such as simian virus 40 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">Tsai et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Lavi and Shatkin, 1975</xref>), influenza A virus (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Krug et al., 1976</xref>), adenovirus (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Sommer et al., 1976</xref>), avian sarcoma virus (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Dimock and Stoltzfus, 1977</xref>), Rous Sarcoma virus (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Kane and Beemon, 1985</xref>), hepatitis C virus (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Gokhale et al., 2016</xref>) and Zika virus (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Lichinchi et al., 2016</xref>). Through our m6A-RIP-qPCR, Rotavirus RNA was also found to have m6A modification (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s3">Figure 4—figure supplement 3</xref>). Of note, genetic deletion of METTL3 in monkey kidney MA104 cell line, which has limited IFN responses (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Sánchez-Tacuba et al., 2020</xref>), also led to reduced RV replication (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s3">Figure 2—figure supplement 3</xref>). Further, IRF7 deficiency didn’t fully restore the suppressed rotaviral infection in <italic>Mettl3</italic>ΔIEC mice (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3e</xref>). These results suggest that besides the contribution of <italic>Irf7</italic> to the resistant phenotype of rotavirus infection in IECs from <italic>Mettl3</italic>ΔIEC mice, other pathways (e.g. m6A modifications in RV RNA) may also play roles. The detailed mechanisms warrant further investigations in the future.</p><p>Intriguingly, m6A modifications were shown to maintain the genomic stability of mice embryonic stem cells by promoting the degradation of endogenous retrovirus (ERV) mRNA, or by regulating ERV heterochromatin and inhibiting its transcription (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">Xu et al., 2021</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Chelmicki et al., 2021</xref>). The absence of m6A results in the formation of abnormal endogenous dsRNA, which causes an aberrant immune response and necrosis in the hematopoietic system (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Gao et al., 2020</xref>). In the intestine, through immunostaining with J2 antibody, we detected the increase of dsRNA levels in IECs of <italic>Mettl3</italic>ΔIEC mice compare to the littermate WT mice (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s4">Figure 4—figure supplement 4</xref>). In consistency, the aforementioned RNA-seq data showed that the expression of a set of ISGs including <italic>Irf7</italic> was significantly upregulated in <italic>Mettl3</italic> KO IECs. Our data suggest a dual activation model in steady state that in the absence of METTL3, the increase of dsRNA will induce the IFN responses, and the increased stability of <italic>Irf7</italic> mRNA, which serves as a key transcription factor of IFN and ISG expression, will amplify this process. Furthermore, m6A modification of viral RNA genomes affect the activation of innate sensor-mediated signaling (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Chen et al., 2021</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Kim et al., 2020</xref>). Decreased m6A modification on RV genomes may activate innate sensors directly and induce higher IFN response, which will also be amplified by increase of <italic>Irf7</italic> mRNA stability.</p><p>Although m6A is involved in many important biological processes, the regulation of m6A modifications remain poorly understood. Here, we found RV infection down-regulates the level of m6A eraser ALKBH5 to induce m6A modifications, in an NSP1 dependent manner. The precise mechanism remains to be examined. As a result, ALKBH5 deficiency in IECs results in normal susceptibility to RV infection. In addition, the global m6A modification on mRNA transcripts declines by ages in the intestine, with a significant drop from 2 to 3 weeks post birth, which implicate the drop of RV infectivity in adult mice vs neonatal mice. The dual regulation of m6A levels during RV infection and development provide new insights into the choice of either RV or the host on regulation of m6A modification to achieve either immune evasion or immune surveillance, respectively.</p><p>In conclusion, our work shed light into a novel role of m6A modifications in RV infection in vivo, and reported a tissue specific regulation of m6A during RV infection or development (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4g</xref>). Future studies on tissue-specific regulation of m6A modification by viral infections in other tissues and organs (e.g. lung, liver) will be of interest.</p></sec><sec id="s4" sec-type="materials|methods"><title>Materials and methods</title><sec id="s4-1"><title>Mice</title><p>METTL3 conditional knockout mice were generated by inserting two loxp sites into the intron after the first exon and the intron before the last exon of <italic>Mettl3</italic> using CRISPR/cas9-based genome-editing system as previously described (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Li et al., 2017</xref>).

Your article has been reviewed by 3 peer reviewers, one of whom is a member of our Board of Reviewing Editors, and the evaluation has been overseen by Tadatsugu Taniguchi as the Senior Editor. The reviewers have opted to remain anonymous.</p><p>The reviewers have discussed their reviews with one another, and the Reviewing Editor has drafted this to help you prepare a revised submission.</p><p>Essential revisions:</p><p>1) The m6A dot blot used in Figure 1 is not a good measurement system of total m6A modification levels, because the antibody used here also detects other RNA modification, m6Am (PMID: 31676230). Therefore, it is unclear if the increase of m6A dot blot intensity is due to the increase of m6A in RNAs mediated by METTL3 in IECs. The authors should investigate the m6A levels in IECs, not BMDMs, under METTL3 deficiency. Ideally, this analysis should be done using mass spectrometry.</p><p>2) The authors show that <italic>Alkbh5</italic> expression is increased when the mice grow up to 3 weeks old. However, the ALKBH5 protein expression changes are missing.</p><p>3) The decline in m6A levels during early life development is quite interesting. (Line 110).</p><p>– It is not clear if the subtle increase in <italic>Alkbh5</italic> mRNA leads to the change in global m6A levels. The authors can use ALKBH5-deficient mouse cells to confirm this point.</p><p>– Is this related to microbiota changes during the same period of life (PMID: 32165618)?</p><p>4) The authors should describe the overall phenotype of IEC-specific METTL3-deficient mice at the steady state. It is important to clarify if the augmented expression of ISG upon METTL3 deficiency is dependent on rotavirus infection. Also, the authors should describe any detectable abnormalities or changes without stimulation.</p><p>5) The finding that <italic>Irf7</italic> is targeted by METTL3 is not convincing.</p><p>– The authors performed MeRIP-seq and -qPCR experiments only using RNAs from wild-type IECs not from METTL3-deficient cells. It is necessary to show that the modification levels on <italic>Irf7</italic> mRNA is indeed reduced upon METTL3 deficiency.</p><p>– It is unclear if MeRIP-seq is properly performed or not, because there is no quality checking figure shown. For instance, the authors can generate metagene plots or gene logos of m6A modified sites to see if there is any consistency with previous reports.</p><p>– In Figure 2h, the authors should show that the change in luciferase activity between wild-type and mutant <italic>Irf7</italic>-3'UTR reporters is dependent on METTL3 activity by performing METTL3 knockdown or knockout. The authors should also describe how they mutagenize the sequences for clarification.</p><p>– In Figures 2F and 3C, they showed that <italic>Irf7</italic> is upregulated in METTL3-deficient IECs while in Figure 3F, <italic>Irf7</italic> is conversely downregulated in METTL3-deficient IECs. This is apparently contradictory to each other.</p><p>– As the authors mention in their discussion, m6A modification of RV RNA, endogenous retroviral elements, and IFN transcripts can all contribute to the decreased anti-viral response conferred by this modification. Can the authors provide stronger evidence ruling out these possibilities? IRF7 is an ISG itself and could mediate these other mechanisms.</p><p>6) It is unclear if the augmented expression of IRF7 per se upregulates IFN and ISG expression. Since IRF7 exerts its transcriptional activity upon phosphorylation, the authors should examine IRF7 phosphorylation and total protein levels in METTL3-deficient IECs.</p><p>7) In Figure 3, the authors utilized METTL3 and IRF7 deficient mice to show the contribution of METTL3-mediated IRF7 regulation in rotavirus infection.</p><p>– If IRF7 is totally abrogated, IFN production should be greatly impaired as shown in Figure 3A. Thus, it is not surprising to see that the IFN response is diminished. The authors can use heterozygous IRF7 deficient mice instead to check if upregulation of IRF7 under METTL3 deficiency is critical to control rotavirus infection.</p><p>– IRF7 deficient mice did not show increased susceptibility to RV, which is against previous publications (PMID: 30934842, PMID: 17301153). Can the authors explain why? One possibility is that the RV used here also shares the same NSP1 activity as SA11-4F NSP1 to directly target IRF7 for degradation (PMID: 17301153).</p><p>8) Given no effect of ALKBH5 knockout on rotavirus infection as shown in Figure 4, it is questionable if ALKBH5 has a profound role in the regulation of m6A in IECs.</p><p>– The authors should determine if m6A modification levels are increased in IECs under ALKBH5 deficiency.</p><p>– Is it possible that the other m6A eraser FTO has a redundant role? Would it be possible to use in vitro experiments to show that overexpressing ALKBH5 overcomes this immune evasion mechanism?</p><p><italic>Reviewer #1 (Recommendations for the authors):</italic></p><p>1) There are four listed corresponding authors in line 5, but two of them are not listed in line 29.</p><p><italic>Reviewer #2 (Recommendations for the authors):</italic></p><p>This manuscript sets out to determine the previously uncharacterized relationship between rotavirus (RV) infection and m6A modification during intestinal infection by using a collection of both in vivo and in vitro models. The authors found m6A modification inversely correlates with resistance to RV. The increased resistance to RV is due to elevated anti-viral IFN responses in a host with diminished m6A. They investigate mechanism by RNA-Seq and m6A-RIP-Seq and identified IRF7 as the proposed major mediator of this anti-viral response in the m6A deficient setting. During RV infection, the virus up-regulates m6A modifications to limit the IFN response, potentially targeting m6A eraser ALKBH5 for degradation by viral NSP1 protease.</p><p>The primary finding of this manuscript is novel and intriguing, as it broadens the role of this important type of RNA modification. However, there are concerns as to whether the mechanistic conclusions are sufficiently supported, and the manuscript may benefit from adding depth to certain aspects of the study prior to publication. These are detailed below.</p><p>Specific concerns:</p><p>1. Given the central role of IRF7 in the interferon response, it is perhaps not surprising that removing IRF7 reverses the resistance to RV displayed by <italic>Mettl3</italic> mutant mice. As the authors mention in their discussion, m6A modification of RV RNA, endogenous retroviral elements, and IFN transcripts can all contribute to the decreased anti-viral response conferred by this modification. Can the authors provide stronger evidence ruling out these possibilities? IRF7 is an ISG itself and could mediate these other mechanisms.</p><p>2. The authors suggest the reason knocking out the eraser ALKBH5 has no effect is because it is downregulated by RV NSP1. Is it possible that the other m6A eraser FTO has a redundant role? Would it be possible to use in vitro experiments to show that overexpressing ALKBH5 overcomes this immune evasion mechanism?</p><p>3. The decline in m6A levels during early life development is quite interesting and may represent a missed opportunity to broaden the impact of this manuscript. Is this related to microbiota changes during the same period of life (PMID: 32165618)?</p><p>4. In the text line 143-144, &quot;the 5' UTR and 3' UTR of <italic>Irf7</italic> in ileum IECs (Figure 2d)&quot;, do they mean Figure 2c?</p><p>5. In figure 2, it would be helpful to confirm that changes are reflected at the protein level, especially demonstrating an epithelial-specific increase in IRF7.</p><p>6.

The expression of IRF7 is controlled by both PAMP (such as virus component)-induced transcription and post-transcriptional regulation like m6A modification mediated mRNA decay.

The authors found m6A modification inversely correlates with resistance to RV. The increased resistance to RV is due to elevated anti-viral IFN responses in a host with diminished m6A. They investigate mechanism by RNA-Seq and m6A-RIP-Seq and identified IRF7 as the proposed major mediator of this anti-viral response in the m6A deficient setting. During RV infection, the virus up-regulates m6A modifications to limit the IFN response, potentially targeting m6A eraser ALKBH5 for degradation by viral NSP1 protease.</p><p>The primary finding of this manuscript is novel and intriguing, as it broadens the role of this important type of RNA modification. However, there are concerns as to whether the mechanistic conclusions are sufficiently supported, and the manuscript may benefit from adding depth to certain aspects of the study prior to publication. These are detailed below.</p></disp-quote><p>We appreciate the supportive comments and the valuable suggestion of new experiments provided by the reviewer to improve our manuscript. We believe that the new data included in the revised manuscript further validate and support our claim.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Specific concerns:</p><p>1. Given the central role of IRF7 in the interferon response, it is perhaps not surprising that removing IRF7 reverses the resistance to RV displayed by <italic>Mettl3</italic> mutant mice. As the authors mention in their discussion, m6A modification of RV RNA, endogenous retroviral elements, and IFN transcripts can all contribute to the decreased anti-viral response conferred by this modification. Can the authors provide stronger evidence ruling out these possibilities? IRF7 is an ISG itself and could mediate these other mechanisms.</p></disp-quote><p>We thank the reviewer for raising an important point. We constructed plasmids pLVX-<italic>Irf7</italic>-WT (<italic>Irf7</italic>-WT) or pLVX-<italic>Irf7</italic>-Mut containing mutated m6A modification sites (<italic>Irf7</italic>-MUT) and transduced it into <italic>Irf7</italic><sup>-/-</sup> MEF cells. We found that <italic>Irf7</italic> without m6A modification led to increased expression of <italic>Irf7</italic> and ISGs (Figure 2—figure supplement 4a and 4b), and enhanced antiviral responses in MEF cells (Figure 2—figure supplement 4a). These data cannot completely exclude other mechanisms but further highlighted the involvement of m6A modification on <italic>Irf7</italic> in the resistance phenotype to virus infection by METTL3 deficiency.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>2. The authors suggest the reason knocking out the eraser ALKBH5 has no effect is because it is downregulated by RV NSP1. Is it possible that the other m6A eraser FTO has a redundant role? Would it be possible to use in vitro experiments to show that overexpressing ALKBH5 overcomes this immune evasion mechanism?</p></disp-quote><p>We thank the reviewer for the comments. We checked the expression of <italic>Alkbh5/ALKBH5</italic> and <italic>Fto/FTO</italic> in our RNA-seq data in mouse IECs, and also a previous reported RNA-seq data in human intestinal enteroid (Kapil Saxena, et al., PNAS. 2017). We found the <italic>Alkbh5/ALKBH5</italic> expression is much higher than <italic>Fto/FTO</italic> in intestine (Figure 4—figure supplement 1a). We did qPCR analysis in mouse epithelial cell line MODE-K and showed the similar results (Figure 4—figure supplement 1a). Furthermore, we knock down METTL3, ALKBH5 and FTO in MODE-K cell. Through dot blot assay, we found ALKBH5 but not FTO is the dominant m6A eraser in IECs (Figure 4—figure supplement 1).</p><p>Then we transduced plasmid encoding ALKBH5 or control plasmid in MODE-K cell and infected these cells with RRV. Indeed, we found the overexpression of ALKBH5 reinforced the protein level of ALKBH5, increase the IFN/ISGs expression and inhibit RRV infection in MODE-K cell (Figure 4—figure supplement 2), indicating overexpressing ALKBH5 overcomes the immune evasion mechanism mediated by RV.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>3.
