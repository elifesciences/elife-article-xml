Yet, their downstream oncogenic signaling mechanisms are poorly understood. We used global phosphoproteomics and kinase activity profiling to map conserved signaling outputs driven by a range of genetic changes that activate PKA in human cancer. Two signaling networks were identified downstream of PKA: RAS/MAPK components and an Aurora Kinase A (AURKA)/glycogen synthase kinase (GSK3) sub-network with activity toward MYC oncoproteins. Findings were validated in two PKA-dependent cancer models: a novel, patient-derived fibrolamellar carcinoma (FLC) line that expresses a DNAJ-PKAc fusion and a PKA-addicted melanoma model with a mutant type I PKA regulatory subunit. We identify PKA signals that can influence both de novo translation and stability of the proto-oncogene c-MYC. However, the primary mechanism of PKA effects on MYC in our cell models was translation and could be blocked with the eIF4A inhibitor zotatifin. This compound dramatically reduced c-MYC expression and inhibited FLC cell line growth in vitro. Thus, targeting PKA effects on translation is a potential treatment strategy for FLC and other PKA-driven cancers.</p></abstract><kwd-group kwd-group-type="author-keywords"><kwd>protein kinase A</kwd><kwd>kinase proteomics</kwd><kwd>MYC</kwd><kwd>fibrolamellar liver cancer</kwd></kwd-group><kwd-group kwd-group-type="research-organism"><title>Research organism</title><kwd>Human</kwd></kwd-group><funding-group><award-group id="fund1"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100007909</institution-id><institution>Fibrolamellar Cancer Foundation</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Scott</surname><given-names>John D</given-names></name><name><surname>Gordan</surname><given-names>John D</given-names></name><name><surname>Bardeesy</surname><given-names>Nabeel</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund2"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution>Burroughs Wellcome Fund Career Award</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Gordan</surname><given-names>John D</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund3"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000002</institution-id><institution>National Institutes of Health</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>DK119192</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Scott</surname><given-names>John D</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund4"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution>DOD Peer Reviewed Cancer Research Program</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>12715138</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Yeung</surname><given-names>Raymond S</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund5"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000002</institution-id><institution>National Institutes of Health</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>F32CA239333</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Bouhaddou</surname><given-names>Mehdi</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund6"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000002</institution-id><institution>National Institutes of Health</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>U54 CA209891</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Krogan</surname><given-names>Nevan J</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund7"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100013874</institution-id><institution>Hope Funds for Cancer Research</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>HCFR-21-05-05</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Turnham</surname><given-names>Rigney E</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund8"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100006108</institution-id><institution>National Center for Advancing Translational Sciences</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>TR001871</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Turnham</surname><given-names>Rigney E</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><funding-statement>The funders had no role in study design, data collection and interpretation, or the decision to submit the work for publication.</funding-statement></funding-group><custom-meta-group><custom-meta specific-use="meta-only"><meta-name>Author impact statement</meta-name><meta-value>Protein kinase A-driven increases in c-MYC protein expression and tumor cell proliferation can be blocked by eIF4A inhibitors, suggesting a potential new treatment option for patients with oncogenic PKA activation.</meta-value></custom-meta></custom-meta-group></article-meta></front><body><sec id="s1" sec-type="intro"><title>Introduction</title><p>Protein kinase A (PKA) is an evolutionarily conserved signaling enzyme with established roles in diverse physiological processes, including the regulation of growth, differentiation, and metabolism (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib66">Turnham and Scott, 2016</xref>). PKA is controlled by cyclic AMP (cAMP) generated by the activation of G protein-coupled receptor (GPCR) signaling. Genomic alterations in the components of the GPCR-PKA signaling pathway lead to constitutive activation of this kinase in many human diseases including cancer (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib63">Taylor et al., 2013</xref>), such as amplified ligands of upstream GPCRs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Coles et al., 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib44">McCudden et al., 2005</xref>), point mutations in the G-protein subunit <italic>GNAS</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib52">Patra et al., 2018</xref>), inactivation of PKA regulatory protein PKA-RIα (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib76">Yin et al., 2011</xref>), and mutations that directly alter the activity of the PKA catalytic subunit (PKAc; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Berthon et al., 2015</xref>). Elevated PKA activity as a consequence of <italic>GNAS</italic> or <italic>PRKACA</italic> mutations has been reported in a variety of endocrine tumors (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib54">Salpea and Stratakis, 2014</xref>). A prototypical example is the <italic>PRKACA L205R</italic> mutation, which generates an unregulated PKAc variant found in adrenocortical and ACTH(Adrenocorticotropic Hormone)-producing pituitary tumors in patients with Cushing’s syndrome (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Cao et al., 2014</xref>). Patients with germline inactivating mutations in <italic>PRKAR1A</italic> are predisposed to develop myxomas, thyroid, and gonadal tumors, referred to as Carney Complex (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib76">Yin et al., 2011</xref>). Recently, a <italic>DNAJB1-PRKACA</italic> gene fusion has emerged as the dominant oncogenic event in a rare liver cancer, fibrolamellar carcinoma (FLC; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">Honeyman et al., 2014</xref>). This genetic lesion is found in 79–100% of FLC (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">Honeyman et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Cornella et al., 2015</xref>), with rare cases instead bearing <italic>PRKAR1A</italic> deletion (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Graham et al., 2018</xref>). <italic>DNAJB1-PRKACA</italic> fusions have also been described in very small subsets of hepatocellular carcinoma (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Cancer Genome Atlas Research Network, 2017</xref>), cholangiocarcinoma (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib45">Nakamura et al., 2015</xref>), and oncocytic biliary tumors (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib58">Singhi et al., 2020</xref>). Thus, oncogenic activation of PKA signaling is found in a substantial number of cancers.</p><p>The PKA holoenzyme is composed of two catalytic (C) and two regulatory (R) subunits (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib63">Taylor et al., 2013</xref>). In the inactive state, R subunits form a homodimer that binds and inhibits the C subunits. cAMP is generated by GPCR/Gαs-mediated stimulation of adenylyl cyclase. This diffusible second messenger binds R subunits, causing a conformational change that allows greater mobility and activity of the C subunits, while maintaining localization of active kinase complexes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib60">Smith et al., 2017</xref>). The spatiotemporal specificity in cAMP signaling is provided by A-kinase anchoring proteins (AKAPs). This family of 60 human proteins sequester PKA at subcellular locations, creating nanodomains for relay and modulation of local cAMP signals (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">Langeberg and Scott, 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib49">Omar and Scott, 2020</xref>).</p><p>PKA signaling modulates cancer-relevant processes including growth factor signaling, cell migration, cell cycle regulation, and control of cell metabolism. However, it remains unclear which oncogenic pathways downstream of PKA are essential and in which tumor types and contexts they have the greatest impact (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Burton and McKnight, 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib41">London et al., 2020</xref>). For example, DNAJ-PKAc stimulates ERK activation in an FLC model system (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib67">Turnham et al., 2019</xref>), operating via its interaction with AKAP-Lbc (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib59">Smith et al., 2010</xref>). In <italic>GNAS</italic>-mutant pancreatic tumor cells, PKA-mediated suppression of the salt-inducible kinases (SIK1-3) supports tumor growth (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib52">Patra et al., 2018</xref>). PKA has also been connected to control of the G<sub>2</sub>/M transition (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Grieco et al., 1996</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">Kotani et al., 1998</xref>) and cell survival under glucose starvation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib51">Palorini et al., 2016</xref>). Interestingly, PKA also has context-specific tumor suppressive functions including modulation of the Hedgehog and Hippo signaling pathways and is mutationally inactivated in a subset of cancers (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Iglesias-Bartolome et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib64">Tokita et al., 2019</xref>).</p><p>Despite its oncogenic action in multiple tumor types, PKA is challenging to target directly with small molecules. The ubiquitous role of PKAc in normal physiology makes global inhibition of the kinase a challenge and selective inhibitors of this kinase have intolerable side effects (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib72">Wang et al., 2022</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib65">Toyota et al., 2022</xref>). This challenge is particularly unfortunate in the context of FLC, a disease of young adults with only limited reported impact of chemotherapy, immunotherapy, or targeted therapy to date (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Dinh et al., 2022</xref>). Thus, a better understanding of the essential downstream PKA targets in individual tumor types is a more tractable path for therapeutic development. To gain insight into oncogenic PKA signaling networks and identify potential drug targets, we have investigated effects downstream of PKA activation. Accordingly, we generated cell models with regulatable PKA activity and derived proteomic profiles of PKA signaling. We show that common downstream effects of PKA include increased c-MYC protein expression. In this report, we demonstrate that Aurora Kinase A (AURKA), glycogen synthase kinase (GSK)–3B and the eukaryotic Initiation Factor (eIF)–4B all link PKA and c-MYC.

In a key control, the common essential genes WEE1 and PLK1 both showed a z-score of &lt;–1.

Sensitivity to <italic>PIM2</italic>, <italic>EGFR</italic>, <italic>RPS6KB1</italic>, and <italic>PRKACA</italic> knockdown were also noted, while <italic>AURKA</italic> knockdown did not significantly alter cell confluence. PIM2 is a serine/threonine kinase with similar substrates and function to AKT (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Fox et al., 2003</xref>).</p><p>AURKA (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Dauch et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Gustafson et al., 2014</xref>), GSK3 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Gregory et al., 2003</xref>), and PIM2 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib77">Zhang et al., 2008</xref>) are established regulators of MYC protein stability. To connect these screening results to c-MYC regulation, we first tested a panel of AURKA inhibitors against the PKA-dependent Colo741 and FLX1 cell lines. We noted that the conformation-disrupting AURKA inhibitor (CD-AURKAi) CD532 had the strongest effect on cell viability. This agent inhibits AURKA catalytic activity and also alters its conformation, resulting in destabilization of c-MYC and n-MYC (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Dauch et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Gustafson et al., 2014</xref>). Increasing our interest in this class of AURKA inhibitors, the partial CD-AURKAi MLN-8237 (alisertib) showed some effect in Colo-741, albeit not in FLX1 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5D</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5s1">Figure 5—figure supplement 1A</xref>). Importantly, drug sensitivities (EC50=217.3 nM for Colo741; 692.8 nM for FLX1) matched the reported dose range for AURKA kinase inhibition (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Gustafson et al., 2014</xref>). As a control, we confirmed that FSK/IBMX can increase c-MYC expression levels in an FLX1 cells treated with nocodazole. AURKA pT288 was increased by nocodazole and nocodazole +FSK/IBMX, but we did not detect total AURKA. AURKA pT288 did not correlate with increased c-MYC levels, and nocodazole did not block PKA effects on c-MYC (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5s1">Figure 5—figure supplement 1B</xref>). We next tested a collection of PIM1/2 inhibitors on FLX1 viability (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5E</xref>). We found that CX6258 and SGI1776 can each reduce c-MYC protein levels in FLX1, although this effect is overwhelmed by chronic stimulation of cAMP production (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5F</xref>).</p><p>As inhibitors of both kinases only exerted partial effects on c-MYC levels, we tested combinations of PIM and AURKA inhibition. We first confirmed that both CD532 and MLN8237 alone can reduce c-MYC expression in FLX1 and Colo741. We note an off-target effect of CD532 on PKA activity, which may explain its potent effect on cell viability. Thus, we focused on MLN-8237 for combinations. Treatment with only MLN8237 was able to reduce c-MYC levels in Colo741, but not FLX1, and the PIM inhibitor CX6258 had only a mild cooperative effect with MLN8237 in reducing MYC levels in FLX1 cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5G</xref>). Combination treatment with CX6258 and MLN8237 did not synergize to reduce viability in FLX1 (not shown).</p><p>Finally, as our data above (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3F</xref>) show that GSK3B is phosphorylated on an inhibitory site by PKA and can regulate c-MYC degradation, we tested its impact on c-MYC levels. Pharmacologically blocking GSK activity with CHIR99021 significantly augmented the impact of PKAc activation with FSK/IBMX on c-MYC expression (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5s1">Figure 5—figure supplement 1C</xref>).</p><p>Our finding show that numerous kinases converge on c-MYC protein stability but that single or combination inhibition fails to overwhelm PKA stimulation. Thus, we directly assessed the contribution of altered protein stability in PKA effects on c-MYC. Treating FLX1 cells with the proteasome inhibitor MG132 augmented the impact of FSK/IBMX on c-MYC levels (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5s2">Figure 5—figure supplement 2A</xref>). Similarly, when PKA was inhibited with <italic>PRKAR1A<sup>G325D</sup></italic> induction, MG132 did not rescue c-MYC levels (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5s2">Figure 5—figure supplement 2B</xref>). These results suggested that reduced degradation is not a major mechanism of PKA effects on c-MYC. Similarly, our proteomics did not reveal significant changes in c-MYC phosphorylation on T58, T62, or the putative PKA site S281 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib50">Padmanabhan et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="supp2">Supplementary file 2</xref>).

Related studies have delineated the essential role of PKA as its effector (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Coles et al., 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib52">Patra et al., 2018</xref>). Here, we define the tissue distribution of genetic alterations in <italic>PRKACA</italic> and <italic>PRKAR1A</italic> that result in PKA activation in cancer and map the multiple conserved pathways downstream of oncogenic PKA signaling, many of which impinge on the expression of c-MYC (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7H</xref>).</p><p>Our proteomic analysis has uncovered both expected and novel effects of PKA in cancer cell lines. We note that these findings may represent both direct and indirect effects of PKA, with PKA effects on the cell cycle and cellular metabolism potentially influencing kinase signaling due to changes in cell state. The analysis of kinase signaling recapitulated findings from previous studies, most notably activation of the AKT and RAS/MAPK pathways (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Coles et al., 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib67">Turnham et al., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">Isobe et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Dinh et al., 2020</xref>) and inhibitory effects of PKA on various kinases, including STK11 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Collins et al., 2000</xref>) and its effectors. We also noted substantial effects on kinases involved in cell migration (e.g. YES, EPHB4, LIMK1, LIMK2, and ROCK1), with the majority being inhibited by PKA. These interesting observations merit further investigation for their mechanistic impact in PKA-associated malignancies. When data were integrated using network propagation, we found two key clusters in PKA-driven signaling, one driven primarily by the RAS/MAPK pathway and the other made up of multiple kinases involved in the G2/M transition, also influencing the stability of MYC-family proteins. These findings are supported by other studies demonstrating PKA effects on GSK3A/B (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Fang et al., 2000</xref>) and upregulation of AURKA in GNAS (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Coles et al., 2020</xref>) and DNAJ-PKAc-driven malignancies (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib57">Simon et al., 2015</xref>). Analysis of global phosphoproteomic data further revealed an activity of PKA toward mRNA translation, also seen in the upregulation of mTORC1 targets in our transcriptional analysis (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figures 3G</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">4B</xref>). We found few reports connecting PKA to translation in mammalian cells other than our own previous work showing direct phosphorylation of eIF4B by PKAc (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Coles et al., 2020</xref>), but multiple studies in yeast have demonstrated PKA effects on translation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib40">Leipheimer et al., 2019</xref>), with reports from both yeast and plants that PKA impacts eIF4A (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Bush et al., 2016</xref>).</p><p>A major objective of this study was to identify targetable signaling mechanisms downstream of PKA in FLC. This is particularly critical given that directly targeting PKA appears unlikely to be clinically possible due to the critical physiological functions of PKA. We found that upregulation of c-MYC, and to a lesser extent n-MYC, is an effect of PKA signaling. siRNA-mediated <italic>MYC</italic> knockdown decreased proliferation in FLC, and to a small extent in the melanoma line Colo741. Of note, while FLCs rarely harbors additional oncogenic mutations (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Cornella et al., 2015</xref>), Colo741 has an activating <italic>BRAF</italic> mutation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Ghandi et al., 2019</xref>) which may maintain its proliferation even when c-MYC expression is blocked. The overlapping results from these genetically distinct cell lines suggest that PKA specifically exerts an influence on c-MYC in carcinogenesis. That premise is supported by our finding of upregulated MYC target gene expression in PKA-activated adrenal and ovarian cancers in the TCGA. When transcriptional activation of c-MYC drives oncogenesis, it is often considered to be ‘undruggable’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Dang et al., 2017</xref>). We hypothesized, however, when that c-MYC is induced by an oncogenic kinase that disrupting the upstream signaling to c-MYC could in turn block its effects.</p><p>Our small molecule and siRNA kinome screens identified AURKA, GSK3A/B, and PIM1/2 as potential regulators of c-MYC levels, given prior publications connecting them to MYC stability. We present data that PKA stimulation can result in inhibition of GSK3B, and others have shown PKA phosphorylation of AURKA (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib71">Walter et al., 2000</xref>), although effects in FLX1 are not fully clear. We did not identify an effect of PKA on PIM kinases. While inhibition of AURKA and PIM kinases somewhat reduced c-MYC in our cell models, they had minor effects on cell proliferation and were variable between the two lines tested. Similarly, no significant phosphorylation changes were seen in sites that regulate MYC degradation by proteomics, and proteasome inhibition did not abrogate the effects of PKA on c-MYC in FLC. Finally, PKA could increase c-MYC levels without altering its stability.</p><p>These observations, coupled with findings that PKA stimulation increases eIF4B phosphorylation, suggested that PKA effects on translation initiation might be responsible for its induction of c-MYC expression. Consistent with this, inhibition of eIF4A with the natural product rocaglamide, or its clinically used derivative zotatifin, significantly reduced c-MYC protein levels and potently inhibited proliferation of our cell models. These effects were confirmed to be at least partially dependent on PKA and c-MYC expression.</p><p>Our study has several key limitations. While a valuable feature of our genetic approach to modulate PKA signaling is the lack of off-target effects seen with commonly used PKA-modulating tool compounds, PKA signaling is well known to be precisely spatiotemporally regulated (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Bauman et al., 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Coghlan et al., 1995</xref>) and our overexpression systems do not allow compartmentalized control of PKA signaling. We also note that while our FLX1 cells provide unique insight into the biology of FLC, they have significant limitations. Their long doubling time posed significant challenges in generating stably engineered cell lines, particularly with knockdown of growth mechanisms. Similarly, the FLX1 has proven more resistant to siRNA than our other exemplar line, Colo741 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6D</xref>), particularly when treated with individual rather than pooled siRNAs. Furthermore, our FLC clinical samples and the FLX1 cell line expressed both c-MYC and n-MYC. However, expression of n-MYC was quite low in FLX1, and it was not possible to clearly assess its regulation and contribution to FLC growth. Thus, the development of more precisely engineered PKA-driven cancer cell models is essential to provide genetic validation for the mechanisms that we have outlined using signaling and small molecule inhibitors, with more FLC cell models specifically also needed to confirm dependency on MYC proteins for proliferation. Such models would also enable detailed characterization of the biochemical methods by which PKA can influence mRNA translation.</p><p>This manuscript reports a network map of signaling downstream of oncogenic PKA. We use functional studies to prioritize signaling mediators for their effect on cell growth in PKA-driven cancers, with a focus on FLC models. While our focus in this study has been on FLC, the systems-level mapping of PKA effects in cancer may have distinct implications for other tumor types. This may include a more significant role for PKA effects on c-MYC stability, including via AURKA and PIM2. Whereas FLC has few secondary mutations, the common co-occurrence of PKA-activating mutations with those impacting RAS/MAPK signaling suggests that PKA effects on other targets such as the SIK kinases (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib52">Patra et al., 2018</xref>) may also have a more important role in other cancers. Similarly, PKA activation in <italic>APC</italic>-mutant colorectal cancer could exert important effects on CTNNB1 via inhibition of GSK3. Finally, given PKA’s role in metabolism, its analysis in patient-derived tissues may yield additional nuance. In FLC, our results identify zotatifin as a potential mechanism-driven therapy for FLC and other PKA-driven cancers but require in vivo validation in multiple models to confirm their relevance. With more study, it may be possible to provide proof of concept that targeting MYC by inhibiting its translation is a potential treatment for patients with FLC or other PKA-driven cancers, for whom few options currently exist.</p></sec><sec id="s4" sec-type="materials|methods"><title>Materials and methods</title><sec id="s4-1"><title>Cell culture reagents and treatment</title><p>Human bladder 639V cells (DSMZ #ACC 413), human skin Colo741 cells (ECACC 93052621), and human thyroid ML1 (DSMZ #ACC 464) cells were maintained in Dulbecco’s modified Eagle’s medium (DMEM) supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum (FBS), penicillin (100 U/ml), and streptomycin (100 U/ml).

After letting samples drip through columns, columns were washed with 0.1% TFA and 0.5% AA. Samples were eluted and lyophilized in a speed vacuum concentrator, and phosphopeptide enrichment was performed with immobilized metal affinity chromatography following established protocols (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Budzik et al., 2020</xref>). Phosphopeptides were eluted in 50% ACN/0.1% formic acid (FA) and dried on a speed vacuum concentrator. Enriched samples were analyzed on a Q Exactive Orbitrap Plus mass spectrometry system (Thermo Fisher Scientific) with an Easy nLC 1200 ultra-high pressure liquid chromatography system (Thermo Fisher Scientific) interfaced via a Nanospray Flex nanoelectrospray source. Samples were injected on a C18 reverse phase column (25 cm × 75 μM packed with ReprosilPur C18 AQ 1.9 μM particles). Mobile phase A consisted of 0.1% FA and mobile phase B consisted of 80% ACN/0.1% FA. Peptides were separated by an organic gradient from 2 to 18% mobile phase B over 94 min followed by an increase to 34% B over 40 min, then held at 90% B for 6 min at a flow rate of 300 nl/min. MS1 data was acquired with a 3e6 AGC target, maximum injection time of 100 ms, and 70 K resolution. MS2 data was acquired for the 15 most abundant precursors using automatic dynamic exclusion, a normalized collision energy of 27, 1e5 AGC, a maximum injection time of 120 ms, and a 17.5 K resolution.

protein kinase A (PKA) oncogenic signalling in fibrolamellar carcinoma and melanoma cell line models. Based on subsequent cell line-based validation using standard molecular and cellular biology assays, authors propose a model whereby the oncogenic effects of PKA are at least in part mediated by c-MYC. In addition to stabilizing c-MYC protein, the authors provide some evidence that PKA may stimulate c-MYC protein synthesis in an eukaryotic translation initiation factor 4F (eIF4F)-dependent manner. Notwithstanding that the underlying mechanisms remain obscure, it was thought that this study is of broad interest inasmuch as it provides hitherto unacknowledged insights into the molecular underpinnings of oncogenic PKA signalling and accordingly, it was thought that this manuscript may be of interest to researchers in the fields of cancer research, therapeutics, signal transduction and molecular and cell biology.</p></body></sub-article><sub-article article-type="decision-letter" id="sa1"><front-stub><article-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.69521.sa1</article-id><title-group><article-title>Decision letter</article-title></title-group><contrib-group content-type="section"><contrib contrib-type="editor"><name><surname>Topisirovic</surname><given-names>Ivan</given-names></name><role>Reviewing Editor</role><aff><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="ror">https://ror.org/056jjra10</institution-id><institution>Jewish General Hospital</institution></institution-wrap><country>Canada</country></aff></contrib></contrib-group><contrib-group><contrib contrib-type="reviewer"><name><surname>Topisirovic</surname><given-names>Ivan</given-names></name><role>Reviewer</role><aff><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="ror">https://ror.org/056jjra10</institution-id><institution>Jewish General Hospital</institution></institution-wrap><country>Canada</country></aff></contrib></contrib-group></front-stub><body><boxed-text id="sa2-box1"><p>Our editorial process produces two outputs: (i) <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://sciety.org/articles/activity/10.1101/2021.04.16.438110">public reviews</ext-link> designed to be posted alongside <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://www.biorxiv.org/content/10.1101/2021.04.16.438110v1">the preprint</ext-link> for the benefit of readers; (ii) feedback on the manuscript for the authors, including requests for revisions, shown below.

Your article has been reviewed by 3 peer reviewers, including Ivan Topisirovic as the Reviewing Editor and Reviewer #1, and the evaluation has been overseen by Erica Golemis as the Senior Editor.</p><p>The reviewers have discussed their reviews with one another, and the Reviewing Editor has drafted this to help you prepare a revised submission.</p><p>Essential revisions:</p><p>1. Relative lack of data regarding the signaling mechanisms to corroborate the proposed model was found to be a major drawback of this study. In particular, it was thought that additional mechanistic evidence linking oncogenic PKA signaling to PIM activity is warranted. In addition, it should be established whether the activation of AURKA by PKA occurs directly or indirectly (e.g. via the effects of PKA on cell proliferation). Addressing these issues is required to support key conclusions of the article.</p><p>2. Evidence for the role of MYC family members as key effectors of PKA signaling in neoplasia was deemed to be insufficient. Additional experiments are required to firmly establish that the levels of MYC family members are indeed regulated via the PKA-AURKA/PIM axis and not secondary to the effects of modulation of PKA signaling on the proliferative state of the cell. In addition, alternative mechanisms that may underpin the effects of PKA on c-MYC and n-MYC protein levels (e.g. alterations in translation of corresponding mRNAs) should be considered. Finally, the mechanism(s) whereby AURKA and PIM regulate MYC family member levels remain largely elusive. Overall, it was thought that additional mechanistic evidence related to MYC regulation in the context of constitutive PKA activation is merited.</p><p>3. Some methodological problems were observed. Specifically, several key experiments rely on a single siRNA and/or pharmacological inhibitor. Orthogonal approaches, employing additional siRNAs, appropriate rescues, and/or MYC mutants are advised.</p><p>4. The cancer relevance of results obtained in the studies that relied on the ectopic expression of proteins is questionable. These concerns were based on apparent discrepancies between AURKA and PIM2 levels in FLC tumor lesions and the lack of their correlation with c-MYC and n-MYC expression. In addition, observed variability between AURKA and PIM2 expression between tumor and adjacent liver suggest potential additional PKA-dependent mechanisms of MYC regulation. This, in conjunction with the absence of in vivo studies, suggests that the authors should consider toning down claims regarding clinical translatability of their findings.</p><p><italic>Reviewer #1 (Recommendations for the authors):</italic></p><p>– As authors pointed out, in figure 6B there was a high variability between AURKA and PIM2 expression between tumor and adjacent liver, thus suggesting that additional mechanisms of PKA-dependent MYC stabilization may be in play in vivo. Furthermore, the most of experiments were done in cell lines and thus do not represent what may be transpiring under physiological conditions. To this end, it appears to be warranted that the authors test their model in vivo (e.g. by studying the effects of AURKA inhibitors in PKA-driven cancer xenograft models).</p><p>– Mechanistically, it remains largely unclear how is PKA signaling linked to PIM activity. Although it is reasonable that precise mechanistic dissection may be outside of the scope of the present manuscript, some additional mechanistic experiments are warranted to support the correlative data provided by the authors. Moreover, it is not clear why there is a discrepancy in the effects of PIM1 vs. PIM2 in Colo741 vs. FLX cells, and what was the motivation to pursue PKA effects on PIM2 in FLX1 cells, wherein PIM1, but not PIM2 depletion resulted in reduction of c-MYC levels.</p><p>– Validation of the phosphoproteome and kinome activity data relies heavily on pharmacological approaches. It was thought that orthogonal genetic approaches (and possibly some longer lasting than using siRNA) are merited to further corroborate the authors model.</p><p>– There is appreciable difference between the effects of AURKA inhibitors on MYC between Colo741 and FLX1 cells, whereby in the latter case the effects especially with the MLN compound are not very convincing. The authors should comment on this.</p><p>– Experiments employing non-degradable MYC mutants to rescue the effects of DN PRKACA overexpression on e.g. proliferation and clonogenic growth seem to be appropriate to firmly establish the extent to which the effects of PRKACA are mediated via MYC.</p><p>– In figure 1D siRNA approach was used for a clonogenic assay. The latter assay takes relatively long time compared to relatively transient effects of siRNA. What was the expression of PKA at the end point of the clonogenic assay? Also, the control for the efficiency of PRKACA siRNA should be included. Similar controls also appear to be missing in figure 1E.</p><p>– The authors should consider improving the description of figure 1G, as in the text it is not indicated that expression of DN PRKACA was compared to the overexpression of WT PRKACA in the left panel.</p><p>– As far as I know, the origin of Colo741 cell lines is still disputed. The authors should note this in the text.</p><p>– Methodology was not described in sufficient detail. More detailed information how phosphoproteome and proteome data were analyzed and integrated would be appreciated. In particular in some parts of the paper it is not clear what statistical analyses were employed. This should be clearly indicated in figure legends and methods section.</p><p>– This is a comment that is outside the scope of the article (comes purely from the enthusiasm of the reviewer for this study), but considering initial findings of the authors implicating LKB1 it may be pertinent to test the effects of biguanides and mTOR inhibitors in experiments presented in figure 3A. Perhaps simultaneous use of these compounds with AURKA inhibitors should also be considered.</p><p><italic>Reviewer #2 (Recommendations for the authors):</italic></p><p>1. Cause or Consequence Issue: One of the main issues is that the regulation of MYC and/or N-MYC may be caused by PKA signaling, as proposed, but may also be an indirect consequence of the growth state of the cell. MYC is highly regulated with a ~30 min half-life that is highly responsive to signaling pathways controlling cell proliferation. To distinguish this 'cause or consequence' issue the authors must measure the growth state of the cell in response to PKA activation/inhibition, by conducting cell cycle profiling for example, and show that the regulation of MYC occurs prior to the effect on cell growth. This will involve kinetic analysis of MYC expression at short intervals following PKA activation/inhibition.</p><p>2. PKA regulation of protein translation vs MYC stability per se: Regulation of MYC stability is often stated throughout the manuscript (e.g. line 207; Figure 4), yet MYC half-life experiments were not performed. Is the net result of PKA inactivation a 'change' in MYC half-life or is MYC translation blocked and the decay of existing MYC pools then dissipating with the usual ~30 min half-life? Perhaps the substrates of PKA signaling that contribute to growth occurs at the level of protein translation. What happens to other short half-life proteins in the cell in response to PKA regulation (e.g. MCL<sup>-</sup>1)? Is this PKA-mediated effect on protein stability MYC specific?</p><p>3. MYC phosphorylation and degradation: The authors draw MYC interaction with AURKA and PIM kinases (Figure 5G) suggesting these kinases directly phosphorylate MYC. Further evidence that these kinases regulate MYC directly would add weight to the model proposed. Phosphosite plus lists many sites phosphorylated on MYC and N-MYC, yet I don't think any of these have been ascribed to AURKA and/or PIM. One well-studied phosphosite is Serine 62, which is phosphorylated by mitogen stimulated kinases to promote MYC activity and cell growth. It is also conserved between MYC and N-MYC. Is this the site of phosphorylation by AURKA and/or PIM? Or is this the role of the RAS/MAPK pathway downstream of PKA? Serine 62 is a priming site for GSK-3 to phosphorylate Threonine 58, which then recruits SCF(Fbxw7) to degrade MYC so the Serine 62 site is a high-probability candidate residue for PKA regulation by one or both of these downstream pathways. Interestingly, GSK3 is in the same node as AURKA in the authors analyses (Figure 2E), although α is increased and β decreased. Further interrogation on the site of phosphorylation would add weight to the authors model. Determining the role of the GSK-3-SCF(Fbxw7) in PKA regulation of MYC is important and can be achieved by knocking out Fbxw7 and then determining whether MYC expression continues to be regulated by PKA.</p><p>4. Only one siRNA used throughout: it is the standard in the field to evaluate more than on siRNA per gene of interest to ensure effect is specific and not due to off-target effects. For example, see Figure (3D, F, 5B, 5D, etc.)</p><p>5. Lines 186-191: Are cells dependent on PKA also dependent on MYC?</p><p>What is the dependency score as reported in the Cancer Dependency Map for MYC in the Colo741 cells as they were 'highly dependent on PKA (line 104)' ? Provide relative dependency scores of PKA and MYC in the cell lines used in this study and across all solid cancers.</p><p>6. Kinome-wide siRNA library screen: The results of this screen need to be provided as a supplementary table so hit analysis can be reviewed by the reader. Did the expected positive controls come up as hits? For example, the FLX1 cells are grown in HGF, so a positive control hit would be HGFR (Met). Was AURKA a hit?</p><p>7. Data interpretation (Figure 5C): In Colo741 cells MLN8237 appears to decrease MYC expression more than the MLN8237 and CS6258 together. It is more like an additive effect, leading to intermediate levels of MYC. C- and N-myc levels are so low in the FLX1 cells it is difficult to really see any significant decrease. Densitometry would help score the response to drug.</p><p>8. Data weak (Figure 5D): Decrease of PIM2 is not evident in Colo741 as described in text for Figure 5D. Try stimulating PKA with FSK/IMBX (as in Figure 4) in the presence and absence of siRNA to PRKACA.</p><p>9. Use of AML12: This transgenic knockin of DNAJB1-PRKACA in murine hepatocytes may be the 'cleanest' cell system to interrogate the proposed PKA-AURKA/PIM-MYC axis as the only genetic alteration is the transgene (Figure 6A).</p><p>10. Figure 6B: Many mechanisms regulate MYC expression. It remains unclear whether the PKA-AURKA/PIM-MYC axis is functional in FLC as described as Figure 6B not convincing.</p><p><italic>Reviewer #3 (Recommendations for the authors):</italic></p><p>The study by Chan, Gordan et al., utilizes state of the art global kinome profiling to map the shared signaling networks driven by diverse genetic changes resulting in PKA activation in human cancer. Among the many kinases whose activity is modulated by active PKA, they authors centered their study on Aurora Kinase A (AURKA), and its ability to regulate c-MYC and n-MYC protein levels. They propose an AURKA-MYC regulatory network, and a possible positive feedback loop mediated by the kinase PIM2, which can be disrupted by AURKA inhibition. The study has many elements of novelty, which could be of translational importance. The strength of the study is the use of global kinome profiling and the identification of multiple candidate signaling nodes downstream from PKA. The weakness is the limited mechanistic information provided on possible direct regulatory processes intervening in kinase activation, and the need to enhance the rigor of the studies and to provide quantitative analysis of the data to increase the confidence regarding the proposed novel mechanisms at this stage.</p><p>What is the mechanism by which PKA activates AURKA? Is AURKA phosphorylated by PKA? AURKA expression levels and enzymatic activity changes occur with the cell cycle, so it is unclear what the direct link between PKA and AURKA is, or if this (and other) effects are due to the impact of PKA on general cell growth or other indirect processes.</p><p>Similarly, the proposed link between PKA-AURKA, MYC, and the positive feedback through PIM2 is not mechanistically defined.</p><p>Figure 1:</p><p>The frequency (not the incidence?) of PRKACA amplification described in the text (0.3-3.2%) does not match with the information in the corresponding figure (1B).</p><p>With all the emphasis on the validity of FLX1 cells as a model for PKA-driven FLC, it is not clear why these cell were not used for proteomics analysis (Panel C).</p><p>Unless mistaken, Colo741 skin cancer cells have a frameshift mutation in PRKAR1, but the expression levels of this protein did not change (1G, third and fourth lane).</p><p>There seems to be little expression of PKA C subunit in ML1 cells after dox induction.</p><p>Figure 2:</p><p>The kinases whose activity is regulated by PKA C expression may be direct or indirect, and hence caution may need to be taken regarding the direct regulatory role of PKA on these kinases. For example, the authors mention that many of these kinases are involved in G2M, and hence it is possible that PKA C regulates these kinases indirectly through promoting cell cycle progression, among other indirect mechanisms.</p><p>In Sup 1, ML1 cells that are not sensitive to PKA inhibition were used, without a clear explanation. That said, cell proliferation inhibition by MEK1/2 and ERK1/2 inhibitors were less sensitive in these cells, and mentioned as probably of no interest, whereas there was a very limited increase in the sensitivity to one AURKAi, CD532, and changes in the responses to another MLN8237, which itself was not very effective, but the latter deemed of importance. This reviewer is unclear about the rationale and biological interpretation of the data. The comment on &quot;older generation&quot; AURKAi (ENMD-2076) affecting PKA C induction appears to be odd (line 172).</p><p>Figure 3:</p><p>Seems that only CD532 is effective in reducing proliferation of PKA C dependent cells among all AURKAi tested, raising the possibility of an off target effect.</p><p>In that venue, changes in gene expression reported, most of which are involved in cell cycle progression, may be due to decrease cell proliferation and not acting directly downstream from PKA C, including c-MYC.</p><p>Data on C-MYC siRNA effects (and in fact all siRNA studies, including MYCN) require more than one siRNA and quantitative analysis of the impact on protein expression and changes.</p><p>This also applies to cell proliferation. For example, in Colo741 cells there appears to be less than 20% decrease in cell proliferation after MYC siRNA use, which is of questionable biological relevance.</p><p>Information of cell groups (grey/red/yellow) in FLX1 experiments is missing and cannot be reviewed.</p><p>The text on c-MYC and n-MYC knock down in Colo741 cells seems to be incorrect (line 187) as these cells do not express n-MYC. The impact of n-MYC siRNA on the protein expression of n-MYC (Figure 3D) is not clear, and needs quantification as for most other similar knockdown studies.</p><p>Figure 4:</p><p>Panel B. As for other similar studies, need to use of more than 1 siRNA for PRKACA to decrease the possibility of off-target effects.</p><p>Figure 5.</p><p>Panel B. Use more than one siRNA for PIM1 and PIM2. This is emphasized by the fact that PIM2 silencing abrogates the expression of both PIM proteins.</p><p>The use of MLN8237 and CX6258 does not seem to provide &quot;cooperating&quot; or even additive effects with respect to c-MYC and n-MYC expression.</p><p>The positive feedback loop mediated by PIM2 downstream AURKA and MYC appears to be speculative, and not mechanistically explained, at the protein interaction, activity changes, and/or expression level.</p><p>Figure 6:</p><p>AURKA and PIM2 levels are not regulated in FLC tumor lesions harboring endogenous PKA C activating protein as proposed by the studies using ectopically expressed proteins, nor do they appear to correlate with c-MYC and n-MYC expression levels. This raises concerns about the overall cancer relevant significance of the proposed regulatory model in this study.</p></body></sub-article><sub-article article-type="reply" id="sa2"><front-stub><article-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.69521.sa2</article-id><title-group><article-title>Author response</article-title></title-group></front-stub><body><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Essential revisions:</p><p>1.

However, we also include new data showing that PKA-induced increases in c-MYC protein level occur in cells that are synchronized into G2/M with nocodazole (Figure 5—figure supplement 1B), mitigating the concern that alterations in cell cycle distribution underly PKA-induced c-MYC changes.</p><p>We agree that the mechanistic connection between PKA and PIM is not well substantiated. Unfortunately, there are only limited reagents available to study PIM kinases directly, and their substrates are poorly defined and/or shared with many other kinases. While our revision includes our data showing PIM2 inhibitor effects on c-MYC protein levels, we have removed the data connecting PIM2 to PKA activity and do not make any claims that it is activated by PKA.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>2. Evidence for the role of MYC family members as key effectors of PKA signaling in neoplasia was deemed to be insufficient. Additional experiments are required to firmly establish that the levels of MYC family members are indeed regulated via the PKA-AURKA/PIM axis and not secondary to the effects of modulation of PKA signaling on the proliferative state of the cell. In addition, alternative mechanisms that may underpin the effects of PKA on c-MYC and n-MYC protein levels (e.g. alterations in translation of corresponding mRNAs) should be considered. Finally, the mechanism(s) whereby AURKA and PIM regulate MYC family member levels remain largely elusive. Overall, it was thought that additional mechanistic evidence related to MYC regulation in the context of constitutive PKA activation is merited.</p></disp-quote><p>We appreciate this insight. In addressing these concerns, we find that while AURKA and PIM2 do regulate MYC levels in PKA-driven cancers, the key influence is in fact at the level of translation as proposed by the reviewers. Substantial new data have been added to support this observation, with additional investigation of cell cycle dependence on PKA effects on MYC (Figure 4—figure supplement 1B and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="sa2fig1">Author response image 1</xref>) and PKA effects on translation and MYC, and the use of relevant mutant constructs (Figure 6-7; Figure 5—figure supplement 1; Figure 7—figure supplement 1). We further provide data from TCGA that MYC transcriptional targets are upregulated in the presence of PKA-activating mutations, unlikely to be solely due to cell cycle effects. Specific results are detailed in the response to reviewers.</p><fig id="sa2fig1" position="float"><label>Author response image 1.</label><caption><title>PKA effects on cell cycle distribution in FLX1.</title><p>(A) FLX1 parental cells were treated with DMSO or 50 μM FSK/IBMX for 4 hours, with BrdU added for the last 20 minutes.

The cancer relevance of results obtained in the studies that relied on the ectopic expression of proteins is questionable. These concerns were based on apparent discrepancies between AURKA and PIM2 levels in FLC tumor lesions and the lack of their correlation with c-MYC and n-MYC expression. In addition, observed variability between AURKA and PIM2 expression between tumor and adjacent liver suggest potential additional PKA-dependent mechanisms of MYC regulation.

Furthermore, the most of experiments were done in cell lines and thus do not represent what may be transpiring under physiological conditions. To this end, it appears to be warranted that the authors test their model in vivo (e.g. by studying the effects of AURKA inhibitors in PKA-driven cancer xenograft models).</p></disp-quote><p>We fully acknowledge this point. We have restructured the manuscript so that the primary in vivo data relate to the expression and transcriptional activity of MYC proteins in PKA-driven cancers (Figure 3F-G). The ensuing in vitro analysis delineates several mechanisms by which PKA can regulate c-MYC and posits that translational regulation is the most important. With the scope of this additional work, and relative difficulties in obtaining clinically relevant model systems and compounds, we feel that additional therapeutic studies to are outside of the scope of this manuscript. We state these as key next steps and plan to undertake them in future work.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>– Mechanistically, it remains largely unclear how is PKA signaling linked to PIM activity. Although it is reasonable that precise mechanistic dissection may be outside of the scope of the present manuscript, some additional mechanistic experiments are warranted to support the correlative data provided by the authors. Moreover, it is not clear why there is a discrepancy in the effects of PIM1 vs. PIM2 in Colo741 vs. FLX cells, and what was the motivation to pursue PKA effects on PIM2 in FLX1 cells, wherein PIM1, but not PIM2 depletion resulted in reduction of c-MYC levels.</p></disp-quote><p>We acknowledge the reviewer’s point. Unfortunately, the limited reagents and knowledge of PIM-specific functions has proven a challenge in our analysis of the potential connection between PKA, MYC and PIM. Accordingly, we have de-emphasized these data in the manuscript in favor of more expansive work focusing on the eIF4F complex. We have also removed several of these figures as we do not believe that they contribute significantly to the story and may distract from key points.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>– Validation of the phosphoproteome and kinome activity data relies heavily on pharmacological approaches.

We agree that longer lasting genetic strategies (e.g. CRISPRi) would strengthen the manuscript. This was vigorously attempted, but unsuccessful.

This is of particular interest given that the PKA-inhibited SIK kinases are direct LKB1 substrates. Our new data in Figure 5B speak to this question, with reduced sensitivity to PI3K/mTOR inhibition when PKA is inhibited, potentially due to reduced mTOR pathway signaling as a result of LKB1 activation. We look forward to investigating this relationship in future work.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Reviewer #2 (Recommendations for the authors):</p><p>1. Cause or Consequence Issue: One of the main issues is that the regulation of MYC and/or N-MYC may be caused by PKA signaling, as proposed, but may also be an indirect consequence of the growth state of the cell. MYC is highly regulated with a ~30 min half-life that is highly responsive to signaling pathways controlling cell proliferation. To distinguish this 'cause or consequence' issue the authors must measure the growth state of the cell in response to PKA activation/inhibition, by conducting cell cycle profiling for example, and show that the regulation of MYC occurs prior to the effect on cell growth. This will involve kinetic analysis of MYC expression at short intervals following PKA activation/inhibition.</p></disp-quote><p>We are grateful for this insightful recommendation. The kinetic analysis of c-MYC expression is included (Figure 5—figure supplement 2C), and demonstrates no change in c-MYC stability following PKA stimulation. c-MYC levels were largely abolished by PKA inhibition, so its stability could not be tested in that context. In addition to the proliferation data that have been added to this manuscript, we have tested the impact of FSK/IBMX and PRKAR1A<sup>G325D</sup> induction on cell cycle progression in FLX1. These cells are markedly slow growing, with approximately 1% of cells labeling with BrdU in conditions that label ~20% of cells acquired for another experiment in parallel. While statistically significant changes in % of cells labeling with BrdU were noted, we do not feel that they are adequate to explain the increase in c-MYC protein levels (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="sa2fig1">Author response image 1</xref>). This is supported by our testing of c-MYC mRNA (Figure 3B), which shows a doubling in mRNA in FLX1 but not Colo-741, despite both cell lines showing increased protein levels. Similarly, synchronization with nocodazole did not block PKA’s induction of c-MYC expression. We acknowledge that altered growth rates/cell cycle status may contribute to c-MYC increases, but these many lines of evidence support a model where PKA increases c-MYC levels in part via direct effects.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>2. PKA regulation of protein translation vs MYC stability per se: Regulation of MYC stability is often stated throughout the manuscript (e.g. line 207; Figure 4), yet MYC half-life experiments were not performed. Is the net result of PKA inactivation a 'change' in MYC half-life or is MYC translation blocked and the decay of existing MYC pools then dissipating with the usual ~30 min half-life? Perhaps the substrates of PKA signaling that contribute to growth occurs at the level of protein translation. What happens to other short half-life proteins in the cell in response to PKA regulation (e.g. MCL<sup>-</sup>1)? Is this PKA-mediated effect on protein stability MYC specific?</p></disp-quote><p>As alluded to above, this valuable recommendation has been acted on. We completed the proposed experiment (Figure 5—figure supplement 2C), showing that MYC stability is in fact not decreased by PKA. This analysis motivated our study of protein translation and the inclusion of multiple new figures connecting PKA and protein translation (Figure 6, 7; Figure 7—figure supplement 1). The text has been modified as well accordingly. Given our finding that c-MYC stability is not altered, we did not assess the stability of other short half-life proteins. However, we do include for the reviewer’s interest evidence that protein levels of another translationally regulated protein (ERBB2, see Gerson-Gewirtz et al., 2021; manuscript reference 57) are also increased by PKAc stimulation and blocked by the eIF4A inhibitor zotatifin (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="sa2fig3">Author response image 3</xref>).</p><fig id="sa2fig3" position="float"><label>Author response image 3.</label><caption><title>FSK/IBMX and zotatifin effects on other translationally regulated transcripts.</title><p>(A) Time course of FSK/IBMX in Colo741 and FLX1 showing increased expression of ERBB2; kinetics are somewhat different between the two cell lines.

MYC phosphorylation and degradation: The authors draw MYC interaction with AURKA and PIM kinases (Figure 5G) suggesting these kinases directly phosphorylate MYC. Further evidence that these kinases regulate MYC directly would add weight to the model proposed. Phosphosite plus lists many sites phosphorylated on MYC and N-MYC, yet I don't think any of these have been ascribed to AURKA and/or PIM. One well-studied phosphosite is Serine 62, which is phosphorylated by mitogen stimulated kinases to promote MYC activity and cell growth. It is also conserved between MYC and N-MYC. Is this the site of phosphorylation by AURKA and/or PIM? Or is this the role of the RAS/MAPK pathway downstream of PKA? Serine 62 is a priming site for GSK-3 to phosphorylate Threonine 58, which then recruits SCF(Fbxw7) to degrade MYC so the Serine 62 site is a high-probability candidate residue for PKA regulation by one or both of these downstream pathways. Interestingly, GSK3 is in the same node as AURKA in the authors analyses (Figure 2E), although α is increased and β decreased. Further interrogation on the site of phosphorylation would add weight to the authors model. Determining the role of the GSK-3-SCF(Fbxw7) in PKA regulation of MYC is important and can be achieved by knocking out Fbxw7 and then determining whether MYC expression continues to be regulated by PKA.</p></disp-quote><p>We appreciate this insightful point as well. As our pursuit of this reviewers’ recommendation 2 moved the manuscript away from a focus on MYC degradation, we did not pursue detailed mechanistic analysis to link activated kinases to specific c-MYC phosphosites. We do note that there were no significant alterations in phosphorylation of any MYC phosphosites in our proteomic data sets. In addition, further experiments studying PKA effects on AURKA and GSK3, as well as GSK3 effects on MYC expression (Figure 5—figure supplement 1C) and the impact of proteosome inhibition were included (Figure 5—figure supplement 2).

Among the many kinases whose activity is modulated by active PKA, they authors centered their study on Aurora Kinase A (AURKA), and its ability to regulate c-MYC and n-MYC protein levels. They propose an AURKA-MYC regulatory network, and a possible positive feedback loop mediated by the kinase PIM2, which can be disrupted by AURKA inhibition. The study has many elements of novelty, which could be of translational importance. The strength of the study is the use of global kinome profiling and the identification of multiple candidate signaling nodes downstream from PKA. The weakness is the limited mechanistic information provided on possible direct regulatory processes intervening in kinase activation, and the need to enhance the rigor of the studies and to provide quantitative analysis of the data to increase the confidence regarding the proposed novel mechanisms at this stage.</p><p>What is the mechanism by which PKA activates AURKA?

The data from ML1 have been removed, and more comprehensive data from FLX1 substituted in Figures 5A-B. To expand on our rationale in the experiments with Aurora Kinase inhibitors, our focus has been to identify agents that are potent or whose activity is significantly modified by PKA signaling activation. As many pharmacological studies pointed us towards AURKA as a target, we investigated a range of compounds targeting Aurora kinases and noted CD532 to be particularly active. CD532 alters AURKA conformation, causing c-MYC and n-MYC degradation. However, our western blots showed that CD532 also inhibits PKA directly. Thus, we selected MLN8237 as it had been demonstrated to also alter AURKA conformation in a way that influences c-MYC expression. We have expanded on our explanation of the rationale for selecting these agents in the text.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Figure 3:</p><p>Seems that only CD532 is effective in reducing proliferation of PKA C dependent cells among all AURKAi tested, raising the possibility of an off target effect.</p></disp-quote><p>We agree.

We have also added in significant data using individual siRNA (Figure 4C; Figure 3—figure supplement 1; Figure 7F; Figure 7—figure supplement 1C). The design of these experiments did not enable quantitative western blot analysis, but quantitative PCR is included to demonstrate the degree of knockdown. We also acknowledge that the low level expression of n-MYC made interpretation of its knockdown studies difficult. The revised manuscript has been focused specifically on c-MYC to avoid any uncertainties posed by weak detection of n-MYC by western blot and quantitative PCR.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>This also applies to cell proliferation.

We undertook experiments with individual siRNAs as well but found that a less than 50% reduction in PKA protein expression rendering it difficult to see reductions in PKA signaling. In place of this experiment, we have substituted treatment with the PKA inhibiting tool compound H89 (Figure 3E). We believe that our pooled siRNA experiments showing signaling differences are still relevant to the manuscript and do replicate the findings of both PRKAR1A<sup>G325D</sup> induction and PKA inhibition with H89. This, we believe they merit inclusion as additional supportive data, but we have added further acknowledgement of their limitations.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Figure 5.</p><p>Panel B.
