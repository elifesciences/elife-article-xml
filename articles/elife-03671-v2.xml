By directly responding to G proteins, PIP<sub>2</sub> and Na<sup>+</sup>, GIRK is under the control of multiple signaling pathways. In this study, the mammalian GIRK2 channel has been purified and reconstituted in planar lipid membranes and effects of Gα, Gβγ, PIP<sub>2</sub> and Na<sup>+</sup> analyzed. Gβγ and PIP<sub>2</sub> must be present simultaneously to activate GIRK2. Na<sup>+</sup> is not essential but modulates the effect of Gβγ and PIP<sub>2</sub> over physiological concentrations. Gα<sub>i1</sub>(GTPγS) has no effect, whereas Gα<sub>i1</sub>(GDP) closes the channel through removal of Gβγ. In the presence of Gβγ, GIRK2 opens as a function of PIP<sub>2</sub> mole fraction with Hill coefficient 2.5 and an affinity that poises GIRK2 to respond to natural variations of PIP<sub>2</sub> concentration. The dual requirement for Gβγ and PIP<sub>2</sub> can help to explain why GIRK2 is activated by G<sub>i/o</sub>, but not G<sub>q</sub> coupled GPCRs.</p><p><bold>DOI:</bold> <ext-link ext-link-type="doi" xlink:href="10.7554/eLife.03671.001">http://dx.doi.org/10.7554/eLife.03671.001</ext-link></p></abstract><abstract abstract-type="executive-summary"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.03671.002</object-id><title>eLife digest</title><p>Though every cell in the body is surrounded by a membrane, there are a number of ways that molecules can pass through this membrane to either enter or leave the cell. Proteins from the GIRK family form channels in the membranes of mammalian cells, and when open these channels allow potassium ions to flow through the membrane to control the membrane's voltage.</p><p>GIRK channels are found in the heart and in the central nervous system, and can be activated in a variety of ways. Sodium ions and molecules called ‘signaling lipids’ can regulate the activation of GIRK channels. These channels can also be caused to open by G proteins: proteins that are found inside cells and that help to transmit signals from the outside of a cell to the inside. Three G proteins—called Gα, Gβ, and Gγ—work together in a complex that functions a bit like a switch. When switched on, the Gα subunit is separated from the other two subunits (called Gβγ); and both parts can then activate different signaling pathways inside the cell.</p><p>The Gβγ subunits and a signaling lipid have been known to regulate the opening of GIRK channels for a number of years, but these events have only been studied in the context of living cells. The specific role of each molecule, and whether the Gα subunit can also regulate the GIRK channels, remains unknown. Now Wang et al. have produced one type of mouse GIRK channel, called GIRK2, in yeast cells, purified this protein, and added it into an artificial membrane. This ‘reconstituted system’ allowed the regulation of a GIRK channel to be investigated under more controlled conditions than in previous experiments.</p><p>Wang et al. found that the Gβγ subunits and the signaling lipid both need to be present to activate the GIRK2 channel. Sodium ions were not essential, but promoted further opening when Gβγ and the signaling lipid were already present. When locked in its ‘on’ state, the Gα subunit had no effect on GIRK2, but adding Gα locked in the ‘off’ state closed these channels by removing the Gβγ proteins.</p><p>The findings of Wang et al. suggest that it should be possible to use a similar reconstituted system to investigate what allows different G proteins to activate specific signaling pathways.</p><p><bold>DOI:</bold> <ext-link ext-link-type="doi" xlink:href="10.7554/eLife.03671.002">http://dx.doi.org/10.7554/eLife.03671.002</ext-link></p></abstract><kwd-group kwd-group-type="author-keywords"><title>Author keywords</title><kwd>G protein gated potassium channel</kwd><kwd>planar lipid bilayer</kwd><kwd>G proteins</kwd><kwd>PIP2</kwd><kwd>sodium activation</kwd><kwd>G protein coupled receptor</kwd></kwd-group><kwd-group kwd-group-type="research-organism"><title>Research organism</title><kwd>Human</kwd><kwd>Mouse</kwd></kwd-group><funding-group><award-group id="par-1"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000011</institution-id><institution>Howard Hughes Medical Institute</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>MacKinnon</surname><given-names>Roderick</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="par-2"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000057</institution-id><institution>National Institute of General Medical Sciences</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>NIHGM43949</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>MacKinnon</surname><given-names>Roderick</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><funding-statement>The funders had no role in study design, data collection and interpretation, or the decision to submit the work for publication.</funding-statement></funding-group><custom-meta-group><custom-meta><meta-name>elife-xml-version</meta-name><meta-value>2</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta specific-use="meta-only"><meta-name>Author impact statement</meta-name><meta-value>The G protein subunits Gβγ and the signaling lipid PIP2 are simultaneously needed to activate the potassium ion channel GIRK2 to control the voltage across a lipid bilayer, while sodium ions modulate these molecules' effects.</meta-value></custom-meta></custom-meta-group></article-meta></front><body><sec id="s1" sec-type="intro"><title>Introduction</title><p>G protein gated inward rectifier K<sup>+</sup> (GIRK) channels are inward rectifier K<sup>+</sup> (Kir) channels whose activity is regulated by GTP binding proteins (G proteins) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Brown and Birnbaumer, 1988</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib73">Yamada et al., 1998</xref>). They are present in many different cell types including electrically excitable cells in the cardiovascular and nervous systems (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Dascal et al., 1993</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">Lesage et al., 1994</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">Krapivinsky et al., 1995</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">Lesage et al., 1995</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Karschin et al., 1996</xref>). GIRK channels regulate cellular electrical activity by modulating K<sup>+</sup> conductance near the resting membrane potential. Specifically, stimulation of certain G protein coupled receptors (GPCRs) on a cell's surface leads to the opening of GIRK channels, which increases K<sup>+</sup> conductance and opposes the initiation of action potentials. This inhibitory effect on excitation is best understood in the cardiovascular system, where vagus nerve stimulation slows heart rate through acetylcholine action on GPCRs in atrial pacemaker cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">Loewi and Navratil, 1926</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Giles and Noble, 1976</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib52">Osterrieder et al., 1981</xref>). The ensuing activation of GIRK channels prolongs the interval between pacemaker action potentials, thus causing the heart rate to slow. GIRK channels are also abundant in the nervous system, where they modulate slow inhibitory postsynaptic currents in response to neurotransmitter stimulation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib44">Luscher et al., 1997</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib42">Lujan et al., 2009</xref>).</p><p>Cellular electrophysiology experiments and biochemical analysis have yielded a rich understanding of GIRK channel function. As background to the questions addressed in the present study, the following conclusions have been established over the past several decades of study. First, the G protein ‘subunit’ called Gβγ (a tightly bound complex of β and γ protein polypeptides) is the major mediator through which GPCR stimulation opens GIRK channels (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib55">Pfaffinger et al., 1985</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib40">Logothetis et al., 1987</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib57">Reuveny et al., 1994</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib72">Wickman et al., 1994</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Huang et al., 1995</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Inanobe et al., 1995</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Kofuji et al., 1995</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Krapivinsky et al., 1995</xref>). When a GPCR is stimulated through the binding of a neurotransmitter (or drug) on the outside of the cell membrane it catalyzes guanine nucleotide exchange–GTP replaces GDP on the Gα subunit–and release of Gα(GTP) and Gβγ subunits on the cytoplasmic side (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Gilman, 1987</xref>). These subunits are then free to activate their ‘target’ proteins: Gβγ activates GIRK. Second, the signaling lipid phosphatidylinositol 4,5-bisphosphate (PIP<sub>2</sub>) also regulates GIRK channel opening (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Huang et al., 1998</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib67">Sui et al., 1998</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">Logothetis and Zhang, 1999</xref>). This property means that GIRK channels respond to more than one ligand and thus are under the control of more than one distinct signaling pathway. Third, the activity of certain GIRK channels, for example the neuronal GIRK2 channel, is also regulated by the concentration of intracellular Na<sup>+</sup> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib54">Petit-Jacques et al., 1999</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Ho and Murrell-Lagnado, 1999a</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">1999b</xref>). Intracellular Na<sup>+</sup> concentration increases during excessive electrical excitation. Activation of GIRK2 under this circumstance may serve as a cell protective mechanism through action potential suppression. Finally, x-ray crystallography has recently provided atomic level descriptions of a neuronal GIRK channel, GIRK2, in the absence and presence of Gβγ, PIP<sub>2</sub> and Na<sup>+</sup> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib70">Whorton and MacKinnon, 2011</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib71">2013</xref>).</p><p>The present study addresses the following still unanswered questions. First, does the Gα(GTP) subunit also regulate GIRK function? The Gα subunit co-precipitates with GIRK in biochemical ‘pull-down’ experiments (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Huang et al., 1995</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib53">Peleg et al., 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Ivanina et al., 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib60">Rubinstein et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Berlin et al., 2010</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">2011</xref>) and also exhibits interaction with the channel's cytoplasmic domain as detected by solution NMR spectroscopy (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib46">Mase et al., 2012</xref>). Do these interactions underlie channel regulation by Gα? Second, how does GIRK channel activity depend on the concentration of PIP<sub>2</sub> in the membrane? PIP<sub>2</sub> is a signaling lipid whose concentration in the cell membrane changes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">Lemmon, 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Balla, 2013</xref>). To know whether GIRK activity is responsive to these changes, a quantitative description of the channel's PIP<sub>2</sub> concentration dependence is needed. Until now, no method has existed to change PIP<sub>2</sub> in a known, quantitative and controlled manner in membranes in which GIRK channel activity is measured. Third, do Gβγ, PIP<sub>2</sub> and Na<sup>+</sup>, act on the channel independently or do they function together? The issue of multi-ligand dependence is relevant to understanding the molecular biophysics of channel regulation and to understanding how multiple signaling pathways control membrane potential. At the level of molecular biophysics we wish to understand how multiple allosteric inputs regulate channel opening. At the level of cellular control of membrane potential we wish to understand GIRK's AND/OR relationship with respect to multiple signaling inputs.</p><p>The real difficulty in answering the above questions lies in the compositional complexity and uncertainty of living cell membranes—the natural system in which nearly all past experiments have been carried out. In this study we use the planar lipid bilayer technique to characterize the regulation of GIRK channels by G-proteins, PIP<sub>2</sub> and Na<sup>+</sup> ions. The bilayer technique is a total reconstitution method in which the channel and its various regulatory components are first purified to homogeneity and then combined. Every component of the system is known to within a small error in composition and amount, including the membrane, which is produced from either purified or synthetic lipids.</p></sec><sec id="s2" sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><sec id="s2-1"><title>Robust GIRK2 activity depends on the presence of both Gβγ and PIP<sub>2</sub> in the membrane</title><p>A schematic of the bilayer system depicts two chambers separated by a partition with a hole onto which lipid membranes are painted (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib49">Montal and Mueller, 1972</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib48">Miller and Racker, 1976</xref>; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1B</xref>).

Brief channel openings appear as downward current spikes because the membrane voltage was held positive relative to ground (top chamber, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1B</xref>) and the sign of current was inverted to conform to eletrophysiological convention. When PIP<sub>2</sub> was added to the top chamber half way through the trace, channel activity remained essentially unchanged (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2B</xref>). Similarly, addition of Gβγ in the absence of PIP<sub>2</sub> did not perceptibly alter baseline channel activity (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2C</xref>). Only when both PIP<sub>2</sub> and Gβγ were present, independent of the order in which they were added, did we observe large K<sup>+</sup> currents due to robust GIRK2 channel opening (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2D,E</xref>).

It is thus clear in the bilayer assay that PIP<sub>2</sub> or Gβγ alone are insufficient to elicit robust channel activation. Both of these ligands together are necessary.

The recording on the left side shows that when mutant Gβγ subunits devoid of the Gγ-linked geranylgeranyl lipid moiety (C68S) were added to solution (to ∼116 μM concentration) channels did not open robustly. When Gβγ subunits containing the lipid moiety (∼15 μM in lipid vesicles) were subsequently applied to the same membrane, large currents were elicited (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2F</xref>, right side recording). This experiment shows that the lipid anchor is essential. The likely explanation is, by mediating membrane partitioning, the lipid anchor is required to achieve sufficiently high enough concentrations of Gβγ on the membrane surface to activate GIRK2.</p><p>Cellular electrophysiologists have referred to G protein activation of GIRK channels as ‘membrane delimited’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib64">Soejima and Noma, 1984</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Breitwieser and Szabo, 1985</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib55">Pfaffinger et al., 1985</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib40">Logothetis et al., 1987</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib57">Reuveny et al., 1994</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib72">Wickman et al., 1994</xref>), meaning Gβγ stays stuck to the membrane when it is released from a GPCR and diffuses to its target. Here, this property of membrane targeting mediated by a lipid anchor is nicely replicated in the bilayer assay. The importance of the lipid anchor is also consistent with the orientation of Gβγ in the crystal structure, which shows the geranylgeranylated C-terminus of Gγ pointed toward the membrane (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1A</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib71">Whorton and MacKinnon, 2013</xref>).</p></sec><sec id="s2-2"><title>The sidedness of active channels in planar bilayers</title><p>In contrast to the membranes of cells, in which channels are inserted with one orientation, in the planar bilayer system channels and Gβγ subunits insert randomly and thus are oriented in both directions.

Demonstration of this fact made use of the GIRK channel inhibitor tertiapin-Q (TPNQ), a derivative of the peptide toxin tertiapin isolated from honeybee venom (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Jin and Lu, 1999</xref>). TPNQ inhibits GIRK channels by binding to a specific receptor site on the extracellular surface of the channel.

After a period of time, being a slow GTPase, Gα catalyzes the conversion of GTP back to GDP, allowing Gα(GDP) to again form a tight complex with Gβγ, thus terminating action (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Gilman, 1987</xref>).</p><p>Gβγ is known to activate GIRK, but as stated in the introduction, several lines of evidence indicate that Gα can also interact directly with the GIRK channel (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Huang et al., 1995</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib56">Rebois et al., 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib59">Rubinstein et al., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib63">Schreibmayer, 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Berlin et al., 2010</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">2011</xref>).

Given that the (unknown) partition coefficient is likely independent of C8-PIP<sub>2</sub> concentration, the titration in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6B</xref> is valid for assessing the shape of the titration curve. But what we really want to know is the activity dependence of GIRK2 as a function of the mole fraction of PIP<sub>2</sub> inside the membrane. The practical difficulty in determining this is each measurement for a given mole fraction has to come from a different membrane; and each membrane has a different number of channels. In other words, to compare membranes we have to normalize with respect to the number of channels. To do this we produced membranes with a desired mole fraction of full-length PIP<sub>2</sub> in the lipid mixture, recorded GIRK2 currents, and then applied C8-PIP<sub>2</sub> to maximally activate (or nearly so), as shown (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6C</xref>). Data from different bilayers could then simply be normalized with respect to their maximally activated current. The graph shows GIRK2 channel activation as a function of PIP<sub>2</sub> mole fraction (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6D</xref>). Here, as in the case of soluble C8-PIP<sub>2</sub>, activation is a sigmoid shaped function of PIP<sub>2</sub> mole fraction, consistent with a requirement of multiple PIP<sub>2</sub> molecules in channel activation. Moreover, the steepest portion of the graph (corresponding to a few tenths to one percent PIP<sub>2</sub>) is in agreement the known concentration range of PIP<sub>2</sub> in the inner leaflet of cell membranes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Heck et al., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib69">van Meer et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Balla, 2013</xref>).

In these experiments GIRK2 channels and twofold excess Gβγ (per channel subunit) were reconstituted into bilayer membranes. The 3 dimensional plot shows how these ligands' effects are interdependent (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7A</xref>). As shown earlier, robust channel opening is absolutely dependent on the presence of both PIP<sub>2</sub> and Gβγ (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7C</xref>). By contrast, GIRK2 channels open in the absence of internal Na<sup>+</sup>, but opening increases as the Na<sup>+</sup> concentration is increased.

Using bilayer reconstitution we find the following. Gβγ activates GIRK2, as was previously shown (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib40">Logothetis et al., 1987</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib57">Reuveny et al., 1994</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib72">Wickman et al., 1994</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Kofuji et al., 1995</xref>). Gα<sub>i1</sub>(GTP) does not activate GIRK2 and moreover does not appear to influence the activation of GIRK2 by Gβγ. These findings suggest, at least for the case of the activated form of Gα<sub>i1</sub> (Gα<sub>i1</sub>(GTP)) and GIRK2, that physical interactions between these proteins, if they indeed exist, are without direct functional consequence.</p><p>Gα<sub>i1</sub> inhibits the GIRK2 channel activity only when it is in its GDP bound form, consistent with the canonical view that GIRK is activated by Gβγ and that GDP-bound Gα<sub>i1</sub> sequesters Gβγ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Gilman, 1987</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib72">Wickman et al., 1994</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib53">Peleg et al., 2002</xref>). In the bilayer experiments the action of Gα<sub>i1</sub>(GDP) is so rapid (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5C</xref>) as to suggest that it might bind to the channel and cause Gβγ to dissociate. We think, however, that such a displacement mechanism need not be invoked to account for the rapid inhibitory effect of Gα<sub>i1</sub>(GDP). In drawing this conclusion we appeal to the inefficiency of Gβγ to activate when it does not contain a lipid anchor. Presumably Gβγ fails under this circumstance because, without membrane partitioning, its local concentration near the channel is never high enough to achieve sufficient occupancy to open the channel. Thus, Gβγ apparently binds to the channel with low affinity, compatible with a rapid dissociation rate. Comparatively, Gβγ appears to bind Gα<sub>i1</sub>(GDP) with high affinity, as this would account for sequestration of Gβγ even when no lipid is present on Gα<sub>i1</sub>(GDP) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5D</xref>). Therefore, it seems likely that Gα<sub>i1</sub>(GDP) turns off GIRK by simply binding to the free (channel unbound) form of Gβγ and shifting the equilibrium away from channel occupancy by Gβγ.</p><p>Several further lines of evidence support the notion that Gβγ binds with low affinity to the GIRK channel. During biochemical purification we have never detected a complex between these two proteins on gel filtration even when both proteins are at concentrations in the 100 µM range (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib71">Whorton and MacKinnon, 2013</xref>). Using solution NMR spectroscopy, Shimada et al. estimated the affinity between Gβγ and the GIRK1 cytoplasmic domain (which accounts for the full protein–protein interaction surface) to be about 250 μM (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib76">Yokogawa et al., 2011</xref>). Using this value, if we conservatively assume an association rate of 10<sup>5</sup> M<sup>−1</sup>s<sup>−1</sup> (well below the expected diffusion limit in solution) then the dwell time for a single Gβγ on the channel is calculated to be about 100 ms, a duration much shorter than the wash out time in our experiments. Finally, a low affinity interaction matches the relatively small surface area (∼700 Å<sup>2</sup>) of interaction between Gβγ and its binding site on GIRK2 in the crystal structure (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib71">Whorton and MacKinnon, 2013</xref>). Therefore, all observations are consistent with the idea that Gβγ is in rapid exchange with its binding site on the GIRK channel.</p><p>Given the apparent low affinity between Gβγ and the GIRK channel, the high affinity of Gβγ for Gα(GDP), and the absence of an effect of Gα on channel function, we think the following mechanism is most likely. GPCR activation generates Gβγ and Gα(GTP), then Gβγ activates GIRK, but once GTP is hydrolyzed the resultant Gα(GDP) removes Gβγ from the channel by equilibrium-mass action. This picture is simple and in good agreement with the accepted view, but it raises the following question. If the affinity of Gβγ for GIRK is so low and the interaction so transient, how does GPCR activation ever achieve sufficiently high concentrations of Gβγ in the membrane to activate the channel? It seems unlikely that a single GPCR located near a GIRK channel would be able to generate a high enough local concentration of subunits to activate it, especially if multiple bound Gβγ subunits are required, which we suspect is the case on the basis of the crystal structure (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib71">Whorton and MacKinnon, 2013</xref>). One way to explain this dilemma is to imagine that GIRK channels and GPCRs might be co-localized in relatively large patches on the membrane. Such an organization would exploit a fundamental property of 2-dimensional diffusion: a point source in an infinite space has no steady state solution. In other words, the transition between local and bulk Gβγ concentration will grow radially with activation time. Thus, in a patch of multiple GPCRs (and channels) a sufficiently high concentration of Gβγ on the membrane could be reached. The possibility of co-localization of GPCRs and GIRK channels raises an interesting challenge to the replication of cell-like signaling in the bilayer. It could be that additional cellular elements (e.g., cytoskeleton) are required to perfectly replicate the signaling behavior observed in cells.</p><p>Another question addressed in this study concerns the quantitative dependence of GIRK2 channel activity on the concentration of PIP<sub>2</sub> in the membrane. In the presence of Gβγ, GIRK2 channel activity shows a sigmoid dependence on PIP<sub>2</sub> mole fraction. A Hill plot yields a coefficient around 2.5. We cannot tell from our data whether PIP<sub>2</sub> binding is cooperative (as the Hill model assumes) or non-cooperative (e.g., if multiple PIP<sub>2</sub> molecules must bind, but independently, to open the channel). Cooperative or not, the sigmoid functional relationship points to multiple PIP<sub>2</sub> molecules required to open the channel. This result is consistent with the crystal structures, which show four PIP<sub>2</sub> molecules bound to the channel (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib70">Whorton and MacKinnon, 2011</xref>). The apparent binding constant for PIP<sub>2</sub> is 0.8% mole fraction (Hill model), which, together with the Hill coefficient, describes the position of the steepest part of the sigmoid curve along the mole fraction axis. We see that GIRK2 activity is most responsive to PIP<sub>2</sub> in the mole fraction range 0.1–1.0%. This is precisely the range over which PIP<sub>2</sub> is known to vary in the inner membrane leaflet of cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Balla, 2013</xref>). In other words, GIRK2 is poised to be under control by PIP<sub>2</sub> membrane concentration.</p><p>Finally this study addressed the interdependence of multiple ligands known to activate GIRK channels. Robust channel opening requires the presence of both Gβγ and PIP<sub>2.</sub> Earlier electrophysiological studies concluded that activation can occur at high concentrations of a single ligand and that the role of Gβγ, for example, was to enhance the stimulation brought about by PIP<sub>2</sub> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Huang et al., 1998</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib67">Sui et al., 1998</xref>). Those studies were carried out in cells, where the composition of the membrane is not so certain. The planar bilayer experiments support a simple conclusion: Gβγ and PIP<sub>2</sub> are simultaneously required to activate GIRK2. This conclusion is beautifully compatible with structural studies of GIRK2, which show that when PIP<sub>2</sub> alone is bound the channel's inner gate remains closed (it exhibits the same closed conformation as when PIP<sub>2</sub> is not bound) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib70">Whorton and MacKinnon, 2011</xref>). But when both Gβγ and PIP<sub>2</sub> are bound the cytoplasmic domain rotates with respect to the transmembrane domain and causes the inner helix gate to begin opening (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib71">Whorton and MacKinnon, 2013</xref>). PIP<sub>2</sub> binds near the interface between the cytoplasmic domain and the transmembrane domain. We hypothesize that PIP<sub>2</sub> strengthens allosteric communication between these two domains of the channel. Such a strengthening of interaction would allow conformational changes in the cytoplasmic domain, induced by Gβγ binding, to open the gate in the transmembrane domain.</p><p>Na<sup>+</sup> is not sufficient and not necessary for GIRK2 channel activation. Na<sup>+</sup> increases channel opening in the presence of Gβγ and PIP<sub>2</sub> and thus Na<sup>+</sup> is best described as a modulator of the other ligands' effects (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7C</xref>). This conclusion is easily appreciated through inspection of the C8-PIP<sub>2</sub> activation curve in the presence and absence of Na<sup>+</sup> (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7B</xref>). Not only does Na<sup>+</sup> increase the current level at any given concentration of PIP<sub>2</sub> (and a fixed concentration of Gβγ), but the shape of the PIP<sub>2</sub> dependence curve is affected by Na<sup>+</sup>. In other words, Na<sup>+</sup> does not simply scale the PIP<sub>2</sub> dependence curve. This is explicable if the binding affinity/effect of PIP<sub>2</sub> is coupled to the presence of Na<sup>+</sup> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Ho and Murrell-Lagnado, 1999a</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">1999b</xref>). In the crystal structure Na<sup>+</sup> binds at a location in between Gβγ and PIP<sub>2.</sub> It is therefore reasonable to think that conformational changes induced by the binding of one ligand, for example Na<sup>+</sup>, would have consequences for the binding/effect of another ligand, for example Gβγ or PIP<sub>2.</sub> Although Na<sup>+</sup> plays a modulatory rather than obligatory role in gating, its effect is substantial and occurs over the range in which cytoplasmic Na<sup>+</sup> concentration is known to change when a cell is experiencing excessive electrical excitation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib50">Muller and Somjen, 2000</xref>). These findings are in good agreement with the hypothesis that Na<sup>+</sup> modulation renders GIRK2 a negative feedback safety element (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Ho and Murrell-Lagnado, 1999a</xref>).</p><p>The dual requirement for both Gβγ and PIP<sub>2</sub> may have important consequences for the control of cellular electrical excitability by different signaling pathways. Consider that Gβγ is released upon stimulation of all GPCRs, but GIRK channels only open specifically in response to G<sub>i/o</sub> coupled GPCRs (G<sub>i/o</sub> refers to G protein trimers containing i/o class Gα subunits) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Breitwieser and Szabo, 1985</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib55">Pfaffinger et al., 1985</xref>). It is easy to understand a possible origin of specificity when comparing G<sub>i/o</sub> coupled GPCRs (which activate GIRK) and G<sub>q</sub> coupled GPCRs (which do not activate GIRK) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Lei et al., 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Cho et al., 2005</xref>). G<sub>q</sub> coupled GPCRs release Gβγ, but at the same time the Gα<sub>q</sub> subunit activates PLC, which depletes PIP<sub>2</sub> through hydrolysis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Cho et al., 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Keselman et al., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib65">Sohn et al., 2007</xref>). In the absence of sufficient PIP<sub>2</sub>, Gβγ cannot activate GIRK. Indeed, recent experiments have shown in both atrial pacemaker cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Cho et al., 2005</xref>) and certain neurons (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib65">Sohn et al., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib74">Yamamoto et al., 2014</xref>) that G<sub>q</sub> coupled GPCR stimulation inhibits GIRK activation by G<sub>i/o</sub> coupled GPCR stimulation. It is thus reasonable to think that absence of PIP<sub>2</sub> accounts at least in part for the inability of G<sub>q</sub> coupled GPCRs to activate GIRK. G<sub>i/o</sub> coupled GPCRs on the other hand generate Gβγ without degrading PIP<sub>2</sub> so both necessary ligands are available to activate GIRK. This kind of GPCR selectivity results because GIRK is an AND gate with respect to Gβγ and PIP<sub>2</sub> activation. In addition to the more widespread (but not yet proved) idea of GPCR/target protein co-localization (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Fowler et al., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">Labouebe et al., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Cui et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib43">Luscher and Slesinger, 2010</xref>), AND gating of GPCR targets by multiple ligands provides a mechanism for selectivity in G protein signaling.</p></sec><sec id="s4" sec-type="materials|methods"><title>Materials and methods</title><sec id="s4-1"><title>Protein expression and purification</title><p>Mouse GIRK2 (amino acid residues 52–380) was expressed in <italic>Pichia pastoris</italic> cells, extracted with decyl-β-D-maltopyranoside (DM) and purified as previously described (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib70">Whorton and MacKinnon, 2011</xref>).

After elution from Talon resin and digestion with PreScission protease, the protein was diluted to an imidazole concentration of 10 mM. The diluted solution was passed through a column packed with Talon resin pre-equilibrated with the same buffer without imidazole. The flow-through from this step was concentrated and loaded onto a Superdex 200 10/300 (GE Healthcare, Pittsburgh, PA) gel filtration column in the buffer 20 mM HEPES pH 8.0, 150 mM KCl, 5 mM DTT, 1 mM EDTA, 0.2% DM.

High Five insect cells were co-infected with three baculoviruses each bearing one of the following proteins: Gα<sub>i1</sub>, Gβ<sub>1</sub> and Gγ<sub>2</sub>. Gα<sub>i1</sub> was purified by first binding the Gα<sub>i1</sub>βγ heterotrimer to Talon resin and then eluting just the Gα<sub>i1</sub> subunit by dissociating it from the heterotrimer with aluminum tetrafluoride <inline-formula><mml:math id="inf1"><mml:mrow><mml:mtext>AI</mml:mtext><mml:msubsup><mml:mtext>F</mml:mtext><mml:mn>4</mml:mn><mml:mo>−</mml:mo></mml:msubsup></mml:mrow></mml:math></inline-formula> as previously described (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Kozasa, 2004</xref>). Briefly, cell membranes containing all three G protein subunits were extracted with Na-cholate in the buffer system used for Gβγ purification supplemented with 3 mM MgCl<sub>2</sub> and 10 µM GDP. After binding the extracted protein to Talon resin and washing with 10 mM imidazole, Gα<sub>i1</sub> was eluted in the same buffer supplemented with 50 mM MgCl<sub>2</sub>, 30 µM AlCl<sub>3</sub>, 10 mM NaF, and 30 µM GDP. Since this elution step specifically disrupts the Gα<sub>i1</sub>-Gβγ interaction, the eluted fraction is fairly pure. The eluent is then concentrated and loaded onto a Superdex 200 10/300 gel filtration column in the buffer 20 mM HEPES pH 8.0, 150 mM KCl, 5 mM DTT, 2 mM MgCl2, 0.2% DM. Gα<sub>i1</sub> eluted as a major peak at ∼14.5 ml. Fractions containing this peak were pooled and concentrated to ∼10 mg/ml. For exchange of nucleotide on Gα<sub>i1</sub>, either 2 mM GDP or GTPγS were added to the protein, then incubated at 37°C for 30 min. Slight precipitation usually occurs, but can be clarified by centrifugation at 4°C. The binding status of Gα<sub>i1</sub> was assayed by a controlled trypsin digestion assay (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib47">Mazzoni et al., 1991</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib45">Marin et al., 2001</xref>) in which the activated form of Gα<sub>i1</sub> (GTPγS) is protected from digestion by N-tosyl-L-phenylalanyl chloromethyl ketone (TPCK) treated trypsin.

The same buffers were used for non-lipidated Gα<sub>i1</sub> purification as for non-lipidated Gβγ except that MgCl<sub>2</sub> was added to 2 mM and GDP to 10 µM. The purification steps are essentially the same as non-lipidated Gβγ. After gel filtration, protein was concentrated and nucleotide exchange (GDP or GTPγS) was performed as described above for lipidated Gα<sub>i1</sub>. The function of the proteins were tested with a histidine tag based pull down assay using Gβγ.</p></sec><sec id="s4-2"><title>Reconstitution of proteoliposomes</title><p>A lipid mixture composed of 3:1 (wt:wt) 1-palmitoyl-2-oleoyl-sn-glycero-3-phosphoethanolamine (POPE) : 1-palmitoyl-2-oleoyl-sn-glycero-3-phospho-(1′-rac-glycerol) (POPG) was used for reconstitution of GIRK2 channels and G proteins into lipid vesicles. The reconstitution procedure is similar to that previously reported (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Heginbotham et al., 1999</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib41">Long et al., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib68">Tao and MacKinnon, 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Brohawn et al., 2012</xref>) with some modifications. Briefly, 20 mg/ml of the above lipid mixture was dispersed by sonication and then solubilized with 20 mM DM. GIRK2 and Gβγ were diluted with reconstitution buffer (10 mM potassium phosphate pH 7.4, 150 mM KCl, 1 mM EDTA and 3 mM DTT) supplemented with 0.2% DM to 2 mg/ml (∼51 µM) and 4.8 mg/ml (∼106 µM), respectively. Equal volumes of 20 mg/ml solubilized lipid mixture was combined with each of these protein solutions to make protein: lipid (wt:wt) ratios of 1:10 and 1:4.2 with a final lipid concentration of 10 mg/ml. For co-reconstitution of GIRK2 with Gβγ, the two proteins were mixed, resulting in final concentrations of 2 mg/ml and 4.8 mg/ml respectively. Subsequently, this solution was mixed with an equal volume of 20 mg/ml solubilized lipid mixture. Detergent was removed by dialysis against reconstitution buffer at 4°C for 4–6 days. For reconstitution of Gα<sub>i1</sub>(GTPγS) and Gα<sub>i1</sub>(GDP), the proteins were diluted to 4 mg/ml (∼100 µM) with reconstitution buffer supplemented with 0.2% DM and 2 mM of respective nucleotides. After mixing the diluted Gα<sub>i1</sub> protein solutions with equal volumes of 20 mg/ml solubilized lipid mixture, the detergent was removed by dialysis against reconstitution buffer supplemented with either 10 μM GTPγS or GDP, at 4°C for 4–6 days.

Your article has been favorably evaluated by John Kuriyan (Senior editor) and Richard Aldrich (Board of Reviewing Editors) and two external reviewers (Donald Hilgemann and Christopher Miller).</p><p>The Reviewing editor and the other reviewers discussed their comments before we reached this decision, and the Reviewing editor has assembled the following comments to help you prepare a revised submission.</p><p>In this elegant, thorough, and important fundamental analysis of GIRK activation mechanisms, the authors exploit the membrane reconstitution approach for precisely the purposes le bon Dieu (Ef Racker) invented it. For what seems like millennia of time and kilograms of publications on cellular patch-recording, GIRK channels have been understood to be activated on the intracellular side by G-proteins, PIP<sub>2</sub>, and in some case Na<sup>+</sup> ions. But the complexity of the cell membrane, even when detached from the cell itself, has stymied a quantitative analysis of these effectors. This is not a persnickety pedant's problem of being unable to dot some inconsequential i's and cross some trivial t's, but is a basic deficit that has persistently prevented the field from developing a satisfactory picture of GIRK function. For many channels, such functional landscapes were well worked out long before crystal structures appeared, but for GIRK it's the reverse situation. The various GIRK structures that have been emerging from MacKinnon's lab over past years have been a bit thin on the function that the structures would be so valuable in explaining. Instead, features such as PIP<sub>2</sub> and Na<sup>+</sup> activation had almost to be “read into” the new structures rather than being explained by them.</p><p>With this paper, the situation changes. Now, the important GIRK effectors are examined with full reductionist control, of both protein and lipid bilayer composition: G-protein subunits charged with relevant nucleotides, PIP<sub>2</sub> etc, all in quantitatively manipulable amounts. The conclusions are not surprising – the basic lessons have been long suspected, both from qualitative probing by cellular electrophysiology and by MacKinnon's previous GIRK structures – but they are deeply satisfying and now quantitative. In essence, the functions explain the structures, for a refreshing change. Particularly important is – at last – a proper activation curve for PIP<sub>2</sub>, real PIP<sub>2</sub> from real brains, along with a comparison to the convenient, commonly used exogenous C8-analog. It's also satisfying to see a Hill-fit (nH=2.7) accompanied by an unapologetic assertion that this, while consistent with involvement of 4 binding sites, long-envisioned in cartoons and now seen in crystal structures, cannot adequately distinguish cooperative from independent activator binding. In addition, the effect of Na<sup>+</sup> as a modulator of PIP<sub>2</sub> action is clearly shown by direct experiments, simple on paper but never before properly implemented. The authors even treat old-timers with a brief historical frisson by re-visiting the non-role of Gα, lubrol and all, reminding them of the Great Clapham-Brown Debates of yore that established for the first time the central place of Gβγ in GIRK function. Finally, the exposition relates the mechanistic minutiae uncovered here to central biological roles of GIRKs in cardiac and neuronal electrical behaviors.</p><p>The main issue that needs to be addressed is that the authors need to more clearly lay out the state of understanding of this system previous to their present contributions. They should more directly describe the context, within the existing knowledge, of each of their experimental conclusions and more greatly emphasize which of their conclusions are confirmatory (but done in a superior experimental system) and which are unprecedented.</p></body></sub-article><sub-article article-type="reply" id="SA2"><front-stub><article-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.03671.011</article-id><title-group><article-title>Author response</article-title></title-group></front-stub><body><p><italic>The authors need to more clearly lay out the state of understanding of this system previous to their present contributions.

This is again presented in the Discussion section on the concept of GIRK as an AND gate.</p><p>We have also added to the Results section an introductory paragraph under the subheading “PIP<sub>2</sub> mole fraction dependence…” describing what was known and what we are aiming to understand. A similar explanatory introduction has been added under the subheading “Na+ concentration dependence…”</p><p>The first paragraph of the Discussion (and beginning of the second) has been rewritten to emphasize what was known about Gbg versus Ga interactions with GIRK and why the question of a potential role for Ga is still relevant today. Our experiments show no functional effect, but the case remains unsettled for GIRK1 and Gai3 and other pairings.</p><p>We hope these additions are clarifying and not too redundant regards what is confirmatory (i.e., that Gbg activates and Ga does not), what represents a more quantitative understanding (i.e. GIRK2 activation as a function of PIP2 mole fraction and as a function of Na<sup>+</sup>), and what is new (i.e., the absolute requirement for both Gbg and PIP<sub>2</sub> and the relationship between PIP<sub>2</sub> and Na<sup>+</sup> in GIRK2 activation).</p></body></sub-article></article>
