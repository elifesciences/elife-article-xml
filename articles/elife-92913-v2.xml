The outcome of these pathways determine the capacity of the organism to survive under challenging conditions. Both extracellular ATP (eATP) and Adenosine (eAdo) act as primary messengers in mammals, essential for immunosuppressive responses. Despite the clear role of eATP as a plant damage-associated molecular pattern, the function of its nucleoside, eAdo, and of the eAdo/eATP balance in plant stress response remain to be fully elucidated. This is particularly relevant in the context of plant-microbe interaction, where the intruder manipulates the extracellular matrix. Here, we identify Ado as a main molecule secreted by the vascular fungus <italic>Fusarium oxysporum</italic>. We show that eAdo modulates the plant’s susceptibility to fungal colonization by altering the eATP-mediated apoplastic pH homeostasis, an essential physiological player during the infection of this pathogen. Our work indicates that plant pathogens actively imbalance the apoplastic eAdo/eATP levels as a virulence mechanism.</p></abstract><kwd-group kwd-group-type="author-keywords"><kwd>Fusarium oxysporum</kwd><kwd>Adenosine</kwd><kwd>apoplast</kwd></kwd-group><kwd-group kwd-group-type="research-organism"><title>Research organism</title><kwd><italic>A. thaliana</italic></kwd><kwd>Other</kwd></kwd-group><funding-group><award-group id="fund1"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100014381</institution-id><institution>Peter und Traudl Engelhorn Stiftung</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Kesten</surname><given-names>Christopher</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund2"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100012652</institution-id><institution>ETH Zürich Foundation</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>SEED-05 19-2</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Kesten</surname><given-names>Christopher</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund3"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100009708</institution-id><institution>Novo Nordisk Foundation</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>NNF20OC0060564</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Kesten</surname><given-names>Christopher</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund4"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100003554</institution-id><institution>Lundbeck Foundation</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>R346-2020-1546</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Kesten</surname><given-names>Christopher</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund5"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100001711</institution-id><institution>Swiss National Science Foundation</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>31003A_182625</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Zipfel</surname><given-names>Cyril</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund6"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100004410</institution-id><institution>European Molecular Biology Organization</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>683-2018</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Dindas</surname><given-names>Julian</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund7"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100001711</institution-id><institution>Swiss National Science Foundation</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>310030_184769</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Sanchez-Rodriguez</surname><given-names>Clara</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund8"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100003006</institution-id><institution>ETH Zürich</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>De Moraes</surname><given-names>Consuelo M</given-names></name><name><surname>Sanchez-Rodriguez</surname><given-names>Clara</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><funding-statement>The funders had no role in study design, data collection and interpretation, or the decision to submit the work for publication.</funding-statement></funding-group><custom-meta-group><custom-meta specific-use="meta-only"><meta-name>Author impact statement</meta-name><meta-value>Biochemical and in vivo physiology imaging reveal that plant pathogens actively imbalance the apoplastic eAdo/eATP levels as a virulence mechanism.</meta-value></custom-meta></custom-meta-group></article-meta></front><body><sec id="s1" sec-type="intro"><title>Introduction</title><p>Adenosine-5'-triphosphate (ATP) constitutes the energy currency of all living organisms and is the driving force of many cellular processes. In addition, it fulfills a broad range of tasks in signaling mechanisms once it leaves the cytosol and becomes extracellular (eATP). In plants, eATP contributes to root hair growth, gravitropism, cell death, and to response to abiotic and biotic stresses (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib42">Roux and Steinebrunner, 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Chen et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib47">Tanaka et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Choi et al., 2014a</xref>). ATP reaches the apoplast through transporters (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib48">Thomas et al., 2000</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib41">Rieder and Neuhaus, 2011</xref>) and secretory vesicles (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Kim et al., 2006</xref>). Since eATP is involved in a broad selection of signaling processes, tight controlling mechanisms are required to regulate its concentration. These comprise apoplast facing apyrases and purple acid phosphatases that hydrolyze eATP to adenosine monophosphate (AMP; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib57">Zrenner et al., 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Deng et al., 2015</xref>). AMP is subsequently hydrolyzed by 5’ nucleotidases (5’NT) to extracellular adenosine (eAdo; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib57">Zrenner et al., 2006</xref>) that is either taken up into to cytoplasm by the <italic>Equilibrative nucleoside transporter 3</italic> (ENT3; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib49">Traub et al., 2007</xref>), or further processed by the extracellular protein <italic>Nucleoside hydrolase 3</italic> (NSH3; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Jung et al., 2011</xref>). NSH3 removes the sugar moiety of eAdo and generates adenine (Ade), which is transported into the cytoplast by a purine permease transporter (PUP; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">Möhlmann et al., 2014</xref>).</p><p>Mechanical wounding of the plasma membrane leads to a high release of ATP to the apoplast (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib47">Tanaka et al., 2014</xref><ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://paperpile.com/c/HEnePN/6F0k">)</ext-link>, increasing eATP concentration up to 80 nM (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Dark et al., 2011</xref><ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://paperpile.com/c/HEnePN/XJGw">)</ext-link>, which is sufficient to activate the purinoreceptor <italic>Does not respond to nucleotides</italic> 1 (P2K1/DORN1) also known as the LecRK‐I.9 (lectin receptor kinase I.9; K<sub>d</sub> ~46 nM; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Choi et al., 2014a</xref>).

In addition, the beneficial root fungal endophyte <italic>Serendipita indica</italic> secretes ecto-5’-nucleotidases (E5’NT) that, like plant 5’NTs, are capable of hydrolyzing eATP and thereby shifting the equilibrium in the apoplast from eATP to eAdo (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">Nizam et al., 2019</xref><ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://paperpile.com/c/HEnePN/dqcC">)</ext-link>. Together, these data suggest that the eATP/eAdo balance is relevant for fungal infection and that microbes might manipulate the apoplastic Ado levels in its favor, as they do with the apoplastic pH (pH<sub>apo</sub>) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Felle, 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Masachis et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Kesten et al., 2019</xref><ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://paperpile.com/c/HEnePN/sXw8+rpv6+1rA2">)</ext-link>. However, the roles of eAdo and of the eATP/eAdo equilibrium in plant defense remain poorly understood.</p><p><italic>Fusarium oxysporum</italic> (Fo) is one of the plant pathogenic fungi whose capacity to induce pH<sub>apo</sub> changes is best studied (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Masachis et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Kesten et al., 2019</xref><ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://paperpile.com/c/HEnePN/rpv6+1rA2">)</ext-link>. As a microbe that mainly grows and advances through the apoplast, it represents an excellent model system to study plant-microbe molecular communication in this plant region. We thus made use of an elicitor mix, a crude mycelia extract of a lyophilized <italic>Arabidopsis</italic> pathogen Fo5176 suspension. This extract led to rapid and local alterations of the pH<sub>apo</sub> and cellulose synthesis machinery similar to those observed by the fungal hyphae (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Kesten et al., 2019</xref><ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://paperpile.com/c/HEnePN/1rA2">)</ext-link>. Through fractionation followed by HPLC purification of the elicitor mix, we identified Ado as an abundant and active molecule in the Fo5176 elicitor mix. Our data indicate that Fo5176 increases the levels of eAdo in the apoplast to facilitate its growth in the host. Genetic, transcriptomic, and live-cell high-resolution microscopy approaches revealed that Ado alters ATP-induced plant defense responses.</p></sec><sec id="s2" sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><sec id="s2-1"><title>Fo5176 secretes Ado that seems to counteract eATP-induced plant defense</title><p>We recently showed that a Fo5176 elicitor mix regulates the growth-defense balance in plants (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Kesten et al., 2019</xref><ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://paperpile.com/c/HEnePN/1rA2">)</ext-link>. To identify the molecules in the elicitor mix involved in this response, we performed a bioassay-guided fractionation, using a C18 solid phase cartridge with a 10% step gradient of a water:methanol solvent system followed by HPLC on a semiprep C18 column. This approach yielded a purified active component that we identified as adenosine (Ado) by standard 1D and 2D NMR (<xref ref-type="table" rid="table1">Table 1</xref>) and high-resolution mass spectrometry. Comparison of its retention time and mass data to a pure commercial standard, confirmed that Ado is a main component of elicitor mixes generated from in vitro-grown Fo5176 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1A</xref> ). We then asked whether the fungus secretes this potential new elicitor during plant infection. As the plant or fungal origin of the extracellular Ado (eAdo) present in the host apoplast cannot be distinguished, we tested the expression of genes required for hydrolysis and secretion of eAdo, <italic>ENT,</italic> and <italic>5’NT</italic>, respectively, in the host and the intruder during their interaction. Both <italic>FoENT</italic> and <italic>Fo5’NT</italic> were significantly upregulated during root colonization (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1B and C</xref>), while the expression of the <italic>Arabidopsis</italic>’ homologs was not altered by the presence of the fungus (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1</xref>).

Thus, we first investigated if the plant response to Fo5176 is eATP-dependent by exposing the plants to different concentrations of ATP (10 µM to 500 µM) while infected by Fo5176, as described previously (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Kesten et al., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Huerta et al., 2020</xref>). Indeed, 300–500 µM ATP significantly reduced Fo5176 vascular colonization (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s2">Figure 1—figure supplement 2</xref>). To assess the effect of eAdo on ATP-induced plant defense, we exposed the roots to 500 µM ATP and Ado in equimolar to doubled concentrations of ATP (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s2">Figure 1—figure supplement 2</xref>). Plants treated with 1 mM Ado and 500 µM eATP were indistinguishable from control plants regarding vascular penetrations by Fo5176 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1D</xref> and S2B). Ado on its own did not have any detectable effect on fungal vascular penetration under our experimental conditions, indicating that Ado plays an important role in the plant eATP signaling regulation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1D</xref>). Importantly, eATP-induced root and fungal growth inhibition was not recovered by the addition of Ado (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1E–G</xref>). These results indicate that the plant response to Ado is ATP-dependent and implicate a mechanism in which eAdo interferes with eATP-induced plant defense responses that is not based on plant- or fungal-growth retardation.</p></sec><sec id="s2-2"><title>Plants impaired in ATP sensing or with high eAdo/eATP levels are more susceptible to Fo5176</title><p>To further test the role of Fo-secreted Ado (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1A–C</xref>) interfering with eATP during plant-pathogen interaction, we aimed at creating fungal mutants lacking <italic>FoE5’NT</italic> and <italic>FoENT</italic>. Although more than 165 potential transformants showed successful insertion of the resistance cassette into the fungal genome, none of them were knock-out mutants of the target genes, that is the cassette was inserted off-target. This indicates the importance of these genes for fungal viability and the very possible lethality of <italic>FoΔE5’NT</italic> and <italic>FoΔENT</italic> mutants.

Lack of DORN1 caused an increased fungal vascular penetration rate (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2A</xref>), underlining the role of eATP as a DAMP in Arabidopsis-Fo5176 interaction and confirming previous data (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Kumar et al., 2020</xref><ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://paperpile.com/c/HEnePN/WVU4">)</ext-link>.

To test this hypothesis, we measured both soluble Ado and ATP levels in the media of hydroponically grown plants in control and Fo5176-infected conditions, as proxy for the levels of those molecules in the apoplast. As expected, the growth media of infected <italic>ent3nsh3</italic> plants showed significantly elevated Ado levels in comparison to mock treatments, which were not observed in WT or <italic>dorn1</italic> plants (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s1">Figure 2—figure supplement 1</xref>).

After introgressing R‐GECO1‐mTurquoise into both mutant lines, we found that addition of ATP to <italic>ent3nsh3</italic> led to a Ca<sup>2+</sup> spike in the first 3 min, 1.5 times higher than that detected in WT, which decays to WT levels, indicating that an increased eAdo/eATP proportion might modulate rapid eATP-induced responses (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3A–D</xref>). Consistent with the role of DORN1 as the main eATP receptor, we detected no cytoCa<sup>2+</sup> peak in <italic>dorn1</italic> upon ATP treatment (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3E and F</xref>). Next, we investigated if the external addition of Ado can interfere with this signaling process by testing various Ado concentrations (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s1">Figure 3—figure supplement 1</xref>). While Ado did not induce any changes in the cytoCa<sup>2+</sup> levels up to a concentration of 200 µM, we detected that Ado enhanced the eATP-induced cytoCa<sup>2+</sup> spike transiently when the ATP:Ado ratio was at least 1:5 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3B</xref>). The cytoCa<sup>2+</sup> spike did not further increase in response to higher eATP:eAdo ratios (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s1">Figure 3—figure supplement 1</xref>).

Therefore, our data expand the current knowledge on apoplastic effectors secreted by plant fungal pathogens (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Masachis et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib53">Wei et al., 2022</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib56">Xia et al., 2020</xref><ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://paperpile.com/c/HEnePN/rpv6+OCw0+Zjcq">)</ext-link>. The presence of Ado in the media during Fo colonization of <italic>Arabidopsis</italic> roots did not alter the host-microbe interaction on its own, but blocked the ATP-induced plant resistance, while not affecting fungal growth (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1D–G</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1</xref>). Hence, we deduce that eAdo interferes with the ATP-induced plant immune system activation upon fungal infection. Genetically encoded plant sensors for cytosolic Ca<sup>2+</sup> levels and apoplastic pH confirmed that 10 µM ATP induces pattern-triggered immunity in <italic>Arabidopsis</italic> roots, as we could detect an immediate cytoCa<sup>2+</sup> peak and apoplastic alkalization in response to this molecule (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figures 3A–B ,</xref>–<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">4A–B</xref>). Importantly, the application of 50 µM Ado further enhanced the transient but not the sustained Ca<sup>2+</sup> influx response elicited by ATP, while Ado alone did not induce any plant response different from the control treatment (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3A and B</xref>). A comparable mechanism was already discovered in oviductal ciliated cells in which adenosine itself is inactive but increases ATP induced calcium influx through activation of protein kinase A (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Barrera et al., 2007</xref><ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://paperpile.com/c/HEnePN/mN2B">)</ext-link>. The same Ado concentration efficiently blocked the ATP-induced alkalization of the root apoplast, while Ado levels above a certain threshold significantly increased the ATP effect on apoplastic pH without any effect on the sustained Ca<sup>2+</sup> influx (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4A, B</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s1">Figure 4—figure supplement 1</xref>). As apoplastic alkalization has been reported to be required for Fo pathogenesis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Masachis et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Kesten et al., 2019</xref><ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://paperpile.com/c/HEnePN/rpv6+1rA2">)</ext-link>, our data indicate that eAdo hinders ATP-induced plant resistance above a certain eATP/eAdo ratio by boosting the ATP-induced apoplast alkalization (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6</xref>). Our short-term response data suggest that the rapid apoplastic alkalization generated by eATP is not a main contributor to plant defense against Fo5176, as (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib42">Roux and Steinebrunner, 2007</xref>) eAdo boosts this plant response potentially leading to increased fungal virulence (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figures 1D</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">4B</xref>), and (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Chen et al., 2017</xref>) eATP also generates a pH<sub>apo</sub> peak in the Fo5172 susceptible mutant ent3nsh3, similar to WT plants. It was previously reported that eATP induces defense-related gene expression independently of its effect on media pH (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Jewell et al., 2022</xref>). However, more research is needed to clarify the relationship between pH changes and the defense mechanism triggered by eATP, and MAMPs/DAMPs/elicitors in general, in the process of an infection. The elevated pH<sub>apo</sub> of <italic>dorn1</italic> under mock conditions might indicate a positive regulatory function of signal transducers downstream of DORN1 on H<sup>+</sup>-ATPases (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s1">Figure 3—figure supplement 1D</xref>). The reason for an ATP-dependent decrease in pH<sub>apo</sub> in <italic>dorn1</italic> mutants remains to be elucidated, although another target of eATP might be involved in that response.</p><fig id="fig6" position="float"><label>Figure 6.</label><caption><title>Scheme of the fungal-induced downregulation of the extracellular ATP and Adenosine homeostasis to increase its virulence.</title><p>Previously published results (adapted from <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">Nizam et al., 2019</xref>) showed that ATP is released into the apoplast by wounding, active transport and exocytosis. Apyrases (APY) and purple acid phosphatases (PAP) degrade ATP to AMP, which is further processed by 5’ nucletotidases (5’NT) and nucleoside hydrolases (NSH) to adenosine (Ado) and adenine (Ade). Equilibrative nucleotide transporters (ENT) and purine permease transporters (PUP) mediate take up of Ado and Ade into the cytoplasm. ATP is perceived by the puringeric receptor DORN1, which triggers Ca<sup>2+</sup> influx. Subsequently calcium dependent downstream signaling re-programming is initiated. First contact with <italic>F. oxysporum</italic> 5176 (Fo5176) elicits phosphorylation of <italic>Arabidopsis</italic> H+-ATPases (AHAs) and accordingly the apoplast acidifies (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Kesten et al., 2019</xref>). In this work, we show that during root colonization (red symbols), Fo5176 upregulates expression of eATP hydrolyzing ecto-5’ nucleotidase (Fo5’NT) and Ado transporter (FoENT) and secretes more Fo5’NT, increasing the extracellular Ado (eAdo) levels. eAdo interferes with ATP-induced plant immune system activation above a certain eAdo/eATP ratio by boosting ATP-induced apoplast alkalinization and thereby enhancing fungal virulence. Similar results were obtained in the <italic>ent3nsh3</italic> mutant where we detected higher eAdo/eATP levels compared to WT plants. Accordingly, this plant mutant is more susceptible to Fo5176 than WT plants and we observed a lack of upregulation of Fo5176-induced defense genes. Our data suggest that eAdo is perceived via a hitherto undiscovered dedicated plant receptor.</p></caption><graphic mimetype="image" mime-subtype="tiff" xlink:href="elife-92913-fig6-v2.tif"/></fig><p>Infection assays revealed an increased susceptibility of <italic>ent3nsh3</italic> mutants compared to WT whereas <italic>ent3</italic> single mutants were not significantly different from WT (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2A</xref>).

Our results, though, indicate that the <italic>ent3nsh3</italic> mutant has a higher eAdo/eATP ratio in control media than WT plants, as it secretes comparable levels of Ado but less ATP to the media in mock conditions (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figures 2D</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">3</xref>). This enhanced eAdo/eATP ratio might explain the constitutive upregulation of <italic>DORN1</italic> in <italic>ent3nsh3</italic> compared to WT (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5</xref>). A potential higher activity of DORN1 in <italic>ent3nsh3</italic> under mock conditions can explain its increased response to ATP regarding cytosolic Ca<sup>2+</sup> peak and pH<sub>apo</sub> (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figures 3C–D</xref>–<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">4C–D</xref>). However, during Fo5176 infection, those high <italic>DORN1</italic> expression levels detected in mock <italic>ent3nsh3</italic> drop, most probably as a result of the lack of its capacity to respond to Fo5176 infection, similar to that observed in the <italic>dorn1</italic> mutant (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5</xref>). Thus, we conclude that a constitutively high eAdo/eATP ratio reduces plant resistance to Fo, an hypothesis substantiated by experiments in which WT plants showed similar responses when exposed to these molecules (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1D</xref>). Furthermore, deficient defense responses on the transcriptional level in the <italic>ent3nsh3</italic> mutants corroborated this idea (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5</xref>). The high cytoCa<sup>2+</sup> peaks detected in <italic>ent3nsh3</italic> in response to ATP, equivalent to what we observed in WT plants upon ATP +Ado, suggest a sufficient enrichment of eAdo/eATP in the mutant to respond to ATP (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3B and D</xref>). These high ATP-induced transient cytoCa<sup>2+</sup> levels are not enough to activate a proper defense mechanism in <italic>ent3nsh3</italic>, in agreement with previously reported data (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Blume et al., 2000</xref>). On the other hand, <italic>ent3nsh3</italic> pH<sub>apo</sub> changes in response to ATP were similar to those observed in WT, but the response was not changed by the addition of Ado, which altered the alkalization peak in control plants (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4A–D</xref>). This could be explained by the conflicting published data about ENT3 being a proton symporter while transporting Ado (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib49">Traub et al., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">Möhlmann et al., 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib54">Wormit et al., 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Chen et al., 2006</xref><ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://paperpile.com/c/HEnePN/gNw8+otF2+MTq0+QgZi">)</ext-link>. Since Ado requires the presence of ATP to alter the pH<sub>apo</sub> in WT plants, it is conceivable that the perception of ATP by DORN1 is required to initiate essential phosphorylation of ENT3 prior to transport, as reported for an ENT-family member in mammals (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib40">Reyes et al., 2011</xref><ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://paperpile.com/c/HEnePN/eSd3">)</ext-link>. In addition, since we still detected a pH<sub>apo</sub> increase in <italic>ent3nsh3</italic> mutants in response to ATP, we hypothesize that there is another proton-distribution-modifying component involved. Considering the alkaline apoplast detected in <italic>ent3nsh3</italic> under mock conditions (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s1">Figure 4—figure supplement 1D</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Haruta and Sussman, 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Behera et al., 2018</xref><ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://paperpile.com/c/HEnePN/msYB+g9fz">)</ext-link>, we anticipate that a plasma-membrane localized H<sup>+</sup>-ATPase might be negatively controlled by eAdo. This constitutive high pH<sub>apo</sub> measured in <italic>ent3nsh3</italic> might explain its different response to ATP +200 μM Ado compared to WT since the proton deficiency in the apoplast restricts the plant’s ability to further increase pH<sub>apo</sub> (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4B and D</xref>; S5A and B). It also has to be taken into account that the prevalence of DORN1 in <italic>ent3nsh3</italic> mutants is higher compared to WT (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5</xref>), which could enable an enhanced induction of downstream signals like transient cytosolic Ca<sup>2+</sup> peak (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3D</xref>). The constitutively high apoplastic eAdo/eATP ratio and pH<sub>apo</sub> detected in <italic>ent3nsh3</italic> concurs with an enhanced eATP-dependent pH<sub>apo</sub> increase and could explain the higher susceptibility of this mutant to Fo5176 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6</xref>). We anticipate similar functions in response to other pathogens, based on the reported positive role of DORN1/P2K1 in plant resistance to the soilborne fungal pathogen <italic>Rhizoctonia solani</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Kumar et al., 2020</xref><ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://paperpile.com/c/HEnePN/WVU4">)</ext-link>.</p><p>Our data suggest that Ado could act as an antagonist and compete with ATP over the DORN1 receptor. However, this hypothesis was discarded by <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Choi et al., 2014a</xref> who showed no competitive inhibition of the DORN1 receptor by Ado. It can, however, not be fully excluded that Ado acts as a non-competitive or allosteric antagonist of ATP at the DORN1 receptor. It is also possible that eAdo may directly regulate apoplastic enzymes, e.g., ecto-apyrase/E-NTPDase, E5'NT, or another phosphatase, thereby indirectly controlling eATP homeostasis. A third option to explain the eAdo influence on ATP-mediated plant responses is the existence of an eAdo receptor whose activation interferes with the ATP-induced cascade (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6</xref>). Importantly, maximum cytosolic Ca<sup>2+</sup> concentrations as well as pH<sub>apo</sub> peaks were detected 100 s after simultaneous application of ATP and Ado in all plant genotypes, including the <italic>dorn1</italic> mutant. Therefore we expect eAdo to prompt its effect at the plasma membrane level, like eATP (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3B and D</xref>), and suggest the existence of a dedicated plant Ado receptor as described in animals. Indeed, G protein coupled receptors are reported to bind and sense adenosine in mammals and yeast (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Antonioli et al., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib52">Wang et al., 2021</xref><ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://paperpile.com/c/HEnePN/7e7O+PuoP">)</ext-link>.

What follows is the decision letter after the first round of review.]</p><p>Thank you for submitting the paper &quot;Vascular fungi alter the apoplastic purinergic signaling in plants by deregulating the homeostasis of extracellular ATP and its metabolite adenosine&quot; for consideration by <italic>eLife</italic>. Your article has been reviewed by 3 peer reviewers, one of whom is a member of our Board of Reviewing Editors, and the evaluation has been overseen a Senior Editor. The following individual involved in the review of your submission has agreed to reveal their identity: Kiwamu Tanaka (Reviewer #3).</p><p>Comments to the Authors:</p><p>We are sorry to say that, after consultation with the reviewers, we have decided that this work will not be considered further at this stage for publication by <italic>eLife</italic>. The requested experiments would likely exceed a normal time frame for a revision and it is our policy to prevent authors from multiple rounds of revisions with an uncertain outcome. We would, however, be willing to consider a revised manuscript that has fully addressed the main criticisms raised by reviewers.</p><p>The enhanced calcium signal elicited by by adenosine contradicts the increased susceptibility, and all reviewers believe this is a major unresolved issue. Furthermore, the assumption that Fusarium oxysporum produces adenosine to enhance penetration is not fully supported by the data, as pointed out by reviewer #3. In addition, the use of ent3 nsh3 double mutant is questioned because the mutant has the same amount of adenosine, which weakens the claim.</p><p><italic>Reviewer #1 (Recommendations for the authors):</italic></p><p>The authors identified Ado as an active elicitor produced by F. oxysporum and show that fungal genes, but not plant genes, controlling the production of Ado are specifically induced during infection. Like many elicitors, Ado likely plays a role in virulence, as the addition of Ado can block ATP-induced protection of plants against the fungal pathogen. Similarly, the authors show that the ent3 nsh3 double mutant which has an elevated eAdo/eATP ratio displayed increased susceptibility to the fungus. The authors provide data to show that eAdo can alter eATP signaling in a manner dependent on the ratio. Overall the work presents novel findings that homeostasis of eAdo and eATP plays an important role in plant resistance/susceptibility to the pathogen, which adds a twist to our understanding of the plant immune system. The limitation is with the underlying mechanism of disease susceptibility caused by eAdo/eATP change, as ca<sup>2+</sup> signaling and apoplast alkalization investigated in this study do not appear to explain the phenotype of plants.</p><p>Some of the results observed can be confusing to readers and the authors need to clearly discuss. The alterations of eATP-triggered cytosolic ca<sup>2+</sup> and apoplastic alkalization by eAdo do not explain the virulence function of eAdo. Ado apparently enhances the ATP-induced ca<sup>2+</sup> at an eAdo/eATP ratio of 5:1. As ca<sup>2+</sup> increase is known to be essential for plant immunity, the particular effect of Ado on ca<sup>2+</sup> described here contradicts our knowledge of ca<sup>2+</sup> signal in immunity. eAdo blocks eATP-induced alkalization, and the authors claim that blocking eATP-induced pH increases explains the virulence function of eAdo. Although apoplast alkalization is a well-known PTI response, whether and how this impacts disease resistance is not known. In addition, the ent3 nsh3 mutant has a high apoplast pH but is susceptible to F. oxysporum. Thus the authors need to be careful in interpreting the data. It is fine to use ca<sup>2+</sup> and alkalization as a proxy to show that the eAdo/eATP ratio is important for the alteration of ATP signaling, but at the same time, the authors need to tell readers that these responses do not explain resistance/susceptibility! Thus the authors are strongly encouraged to tone down their statement and address the limitation of their findings.</p><p><italic>Reviewer #2 (Recommendations for the authors):</italic></p><p>This work on purinergic signaling in plants, and the influence of a pathogenic fungus on this represents a highly interesting topic. The combination of calcium response quantification with mutants involved in eATP signalling and control of apoplastic adenylate levels allows a deeper insight into this complex process.</p><p>It is shown that eAdo exerts different responses, it increases calcium responses, and leads to alkalization of the apoplast but counteracts the effect of eATP on root penetration. It is proposed that eAdo activates the plant's immune response, but root growth in the absence or presence of the pathogen is not affected by this metabolite. This is a complex scenario and I have difficulties following the authors' hypothesis. A scheme showing how eAdo interacts with eATP for receptor activation, and how apoplast pH and removal of eAdo is achieved could be helpful in explaining this better.</p><p>I miss the verification of the mutants that were reidentified (dorn1, ent3) and the crossed line ent3/nsh3. Were the same T-DNA insertion lines used as in the corresponding original publications? Please give this information in the methods section together with the line identifiers. Also please show a PCR check on cDNA.</p><p>Line 72ff: What does it mean, ado is the main component in elicitor mixes.</p><p>What is an elicitor mix? How many substances were detected in total? Is the method quantitative? Which percentage is ado then?</p><p>Difficult to see the colors in figure 1A, optimize the presentation.</p><p>Line 101: Why do the authors write &quot;DORN1 impairment&quot;, isn't it a knockout?</p><p>Figure 2 D, E use of different symbols in addition to only colors would allow for easier access to the data.</p><p><italic>Reviewer #3 (Recommendations for the authors):</italic></p><p>The topic of the authors' study has a great impact and provides new insight into the purinergic signal and its homeostasis involved in plant-pathogen interactions.</p><p>Strengths:</p><p>Homeostasis of eATP has been studied for root growth, gravitropism, stomata opening/closure, and plant-symbiont interactions, while very limited information on this topic is currently available for plant-pathogen interactions. The research by Kesten et al. suggested an important role of the ATP level in apoplast that was targeted by the fungal pathogen Fusarium oxysporum. The authors proposed that the fungal pathogen releases Ado to regulate the eATP-induced plant defense during infection. There are only a few case studies regarding the Ado function in plants by Roux's group and Mohlmann's group where its mode of action has long been unclear as a negative regulator of the eATP signaling. Thus, the topic in the authors' manuscript has great potential to open up a new field of study in a regulatory mechanism of purinergic signaling in plants.</p><p>Weaknesses:</p><p>The discussion in the manuscript was incoherent and scarce, especially regarding their inconsistent results. For example, Ado inhibited the eATP-induced defense, whereas it further enhanced eATP-induced calcium elevation and alkalinization. An experiment was conducted under the assumption of high Ado in a mutant (ent3nsh3), while the actual level of Ado in the mutant was comparable with that in the wild-type plant. The authors need to make convincing explanations.</p><p>I would like to support the study in the manuscript by Kesten et al., given the impact of the topic and the scientific merits of the authors' discovery of the novel function of Ado in plant-pathogen interaction. The results appear to be preliminary and incomplete for publication at the present time. In addition, the discussion in the manuscript was incoherent and scarce.</p><p>The experiments using the ent3nsh3 mutant were performed under the assumption of the high level of endogenous Ado accumulated in the mutant. If this is the case, the effect of eATP could be nullified without the exogenous application of Ado. Moreover, Figure 2D showed that it was not actually a high level of Ado accumulated in the mutant. The authors are also recognizing that the eAdo level in ent3nsh3 was not remarkably different in comparison to WT (Line 229-231). Unfortunately, all experiments using the mutant are not actually supporting the authors' conclusions in Figure 2-5.</p><p>The authors did applaudable work isolating Ado as a potential inhibitor of eATP signaling out of a compound mix secreted from the fungal pathogen. However, validation of the Ado secretion from the fungi was not substantially demonstrated. Data only with gene expression measurement (Figures 1B and 1C) are just suggestive but not conclusive. Does the enzymatic activity of Fo5'NT (or FoENT) always correlate with its transcription? Does the protein level correlate with the transcription level of a fungal enzyme gene? Does an experiment using an isotope directly support the authors' conclusion?</p><p>It is well known that elevation of cytosolic calcium level is important to induce plant defense response. If eAdo is hypothesized to suppress the eATP-induced defense response, it is expected to reduce the calcium response. However, the authors showed that Ado further enhanced the calcium response, which is not consistent with Ado's inhibitory effect on eATP-induced defense response against the fungal pathogen. It does not make sense at all and the authors did not discuss it in the manuscript. Is it possible to demonstrate that the increased cytosolic calcium level suppresses the defense response and genuinely contributes to the susceptibility against fungal infection?</p><p>Since eAdo receptors have been reported and well studied in animals, it could be natural to adopt the idea of the eAdo function in plants as proposed by the authors in the Discussion section. However, there are still other possibilities to be tested on how eAdo suppresses eATP signaling. Ado could act as an antagonist and compete with ATP over the DORN1 receptor. It is also possible that eAdo may directly regulate apoplastic enzymes, e.g., ecto-apyrase/E-NTPDase, E5'NT, or another phosphatase, thereby indirectly controlling eATP homeostasis.</p><p>I recommend changing the title since &quot;Vascular fungi&quot; provides us the impression that the authors study the eATP signaling in the plant vascular tissue. &quot;Ascomycete fungus&quot; or &quot;Soilborne fungus&quot; would be appropriate for this study given their pathogenicity.</p><p>Line 58: The role of eATP against &quot;different pathogens&quot; was summarized in Table 1 of Jewell et al. https://doi.org/10.1093/plphys/kiac393, which could be an appropriate paper to cite.</p><p>Since this manuscript is about the role of eATP as a DAMP against the soilborne pathogen, it would be fair to compare the authors' data with the previous report where the soilborne pathogen Rhizoctonia (Kumar et al. https://doi.org/10.3389/fpls.2020.572920) was used and discuss further.</p><p>The term &quot;elicitor&quot; is about a compound that induces (elicits) plant defense. Toxin or effector is a compound that manipulates plant immune systems to help infection of symbionts and pathogens. The term should be distinguished carefully. In addition, I do not agree with defining &quot;eAdo as a MAMP&quot; on lines 203-4.</p><p>Since the study in this manuscript is about an apoplastic effector (toxin?) compound by fungal pathogens, the following 3 literature should be introduced together as previous precedents: Masachis et al. https://doi.org/10.1038/nmicrobiol.2016.43; Wei et al. https://doi.org/10.1038/s41467-022-29788-2; Xia et al. https://doi.org/10.1073/pnas.2012149117.</p><p>Since it is about [ATP] vs. [ATP + Ado], the statistic analysis should be performed between them for Fig1D and Figure 1-supl2.</p><p>Not everyone is an expert in the experiment of vascular penetration by fungal hyphae. It would be helpful for the broad audience if the authors kindly show a few representative pictures or diagrams to explain the method.</p><p>Why the authors used non-buffered media? ATP is a strong anion and it might have a significant impact on pH in the media. Root growth is known to be sensitive to pH. Maybe the Ado effect was masked by the effect of the pH lowering by the ATP addition. What would be the result if the experiment in Figure 2C is performed by preventing pH changing with a buffer to observe a true effect of ATP as a signal?</p><p>Line 137-8: I do not agree that the response to 10 μm ATP is enough to say &quot;more sensitive than previous report&quot;. A previous report showed that even 3 μm eATP provided enough consistent data (Demidchik et al. https://doi.org/10.1104/pp.103.024091).</p><p>Line 161: It is inappropriate to mention &quot;up to 100 uM&quot; without such data.</p><p>Line 166: It is inappropriate to mention &quot;high eAdo/eATP ration in ent3nsh3 apoplast without such data.</p><p>Line 176: How many genes did the authors test for &quot;various&quot; defense-related genes? Can it be specified?</p><p>Line 196: &quot;just&quot; 10 μm ATP? What are the authors emphasizing?</p><p>Line 199 and 200: My understanding is that the inhibition effect of Ado may be not due to a chemical reaction. So, &quot;Ado itself was inactive&quot; should be rephrased.</p><p>Line 205-7: The sentence does not make sense. How can eAdo block plant defense by blocking eATP-induced alkalinization even though alkalinization is for fungal pathogenesis? Instead, Figure 4B, where Ado further enhanced alkalinization, seems reasonably consistent with the previous case in ref 23.</p><p>Line 220: Since ATP is a strong anion, the acidification could be due to its chemical feature since no alkalinization in dorn1 was induced, as an alternative.</p><p>Line 221: The authors pointed out that P2K2 is involved in eATP-induced apoplastic acidification in Figures4E and 4F. Please explain and discuss further in detail.</p><p>Line 221-2: I had a tough time to understand how GPA is involved in the acidification in dorn1. Please elaborate more.</p><p>Line 247: I am not sure that it is a concentration-dependent manner since 10 μm and 200 μm of Ado evoked the opposite responses (Figure 4A and 4B). Please rephrase in an appropriate manner.</p><p>Line 249-51. I do not understand the sentence. Did the authors mean ENT3 is directly regulating (or transporting) protons since the authors speculated that phosphorylation of ENT3 by eATP is required for Ado-elicited pH changes? The following sentence on lines 251-3 was more confusing. Do the authors hypothesize ENT3 as an H<sup>+</sup> transporter?</p><p>Line 252-55: The authors speculate that there are H<sup>+</sup>-ATPases for ATP/Ado-induced pH changes. Indeed, ATP-induced calcium response and apoplastic pH (also cytosolic pH) are reported to be associated based on the data in Behera et al. https://doi.org/10.1105/tpc.18.00655 and in Figure 5D in Haruta et al. https://doi.org/10.1104/pp.111.189167. It would be nice to discuss this further by citing these publications.</p><p>I do not understand the logic of the authors' conclusion on lines 262-3. The authors speculated that there is a potential Ado receptor because eATP signaling is required for the inhibition effect by Ado.</p><p>[Editors’ note: further revisions were suggested prior to acceptance, as described below.]</p><p>Thank you for submitting your article &quot;Soil-borne fungi alter the apoplastic purinergic signaling in plants by deregulating the homeostasis of extracellular ATP and its metabolite adenosine&quot; for consideration by <italic>eLife</italic>.

This novel perspective on the regulation of purinergic signaling in plants has the potential to open up a new field of study. The authors' research demonstrated the important role of eAdo in controlling the eATP/eAdo ratio in the apoplast and its influence on eATP-mediated plant defense responses. The findings suggest that altering this ratio can enhance susceptibility to pathogens, offering valuable insights into the plant's immune response mechanisms. Despite its promising insights, the manuscript leaves certain aspects unresolved, particularly concerning the precise mechanisms of how eAdo is perceived and the exact impact of eATP/eAdo ratio on plant responses to eATP. Further research and exploration are needed for a full understanding of these mechanisms and can be pursued in the future.</p><p>The authors have made significant improvements to the original manuscript. I only have a few minor comments that could improve the current version further:</p><p>Line 28: The term &quot;secondary messengers&quot; used for eATP and possibly eAdo is not accurate in the context of cell biology. Since eATP initiates a series of downstream signaling events, it should be referred to as a primary messenger. Secondary messengers, like cytosolic ca<sup>2+</sup>, serve to amplify signals generated by the binding of a primary messenger to specific cell surface receptors.</p><p>Line 110: I found the term &quot;ATP equilibrium&quot; unclear. It would be helpful if the authors could clarify what it means. I suspect that the authors are referring to a mechanism involving negative feedback to regulate excessive eATP signaling.</p><p>Lines 245-246: While references 41 and 42 were cited, their placement in the text appears inappropriate. These papers are still relevant and should be mentioned somewhere in the Discussion section with a more appropriate context.</p><p>I'm still finding it challenging to fully grasp how the ATP/Ado ratio and pH alterations might influence a plant's susceptibility. For example, in Figure 1D, an ATP/Ado ratio of 1:2 appears to inhibit eATP-induced resistance. Moreover, at an ATP/Ado ratio of 1:5, eATP-induced pH elevation is suppressed, while a ratio of 1:20 enhances the pH elevation caused by eATP. What might offer a reasonable explanation for the relationship between pH changes and the defense mechanism triggered by eATP?</p><p><italic>Reviewer #3 (Recommendations for the authors):</italic></p><p>I still think that a PCR confirmation of the mutans used (lack of transcript) would strengthen the work.</p></body></sub-article><sub-article article-type="reply" id="sa2"><front-stub><article-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.92913.sa2</article-id><title-group><article-title>Author response</article-title></title-group></front-stub><body><p>[Editors’ note: the authors resubmitted a revised version of the paper for consideration.

The limitation is with the underlying mechanism of disease susceptibility caused by eAdo/eATP change, as ca<sup>2+</sup> signaling and apoplast alkalization investigated in this study do not appear to explain the phenotype of plants.</p></disp-quote><p>Many thanks for the summary and comments. Please, read below our response to your concerns.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Some of the results observed can be confusing to readers and the authors need to clearly discuss. The alterations of eATP-triggered cytosolic ca<sup>2+</sup> and apoplastic alkalization by eAdo do not explain the virulence function of eAdo. Ado apparently enhances the ATP-induced ca<sup>2+</sup> at an eAdo/eATP ratio of 5:1. As ca<sup>2+</sup> increase is known to be essential for plant immunity, the particular effect of Ado on ca<sup>2+</sup> described here contradicts our knowledge of ca<sup>2+</sup> signal in immunity. eAdo blocks eATP-induced alkalization, and the authors claim that blocking eATP-induced pH increases explains the virulence function of eAdo. Although apoplast alkalization is a well-known PTI response, whether and how this impacts disease resistance is not known. In addition, the ent3 nsh3 mutant has a high apoplast pH but is susceptible to F. oxysporum. Thus the authors need to be careful in interpreting the data. It is fine to use ca<sup>2+</sup> and alkalization as a proxy to show that the eAdo/eATP ratio is important for the alteration of ATP signaling, but at the same time, the authors need to tell readers that these responses do not explain resistance/susceptibility! Thus the authors are strongly encouraged to tone down their statement and address the limitation of their findings.</p></disp-quote><p>Many thanks for pointing out these confusions that we address here and in the new version of the manuscript.</p><list list-type="bullet"><list-item><p>Regarding the Ado enhancement of the ATP-induced [ca<sup>2+</sup>]<sub>cyt</sub> elevation, our data show that Ado only alters the ATP-induced rapid [ca<sup>2+</sup>]<sub>cyt</sub> transient peak but not the ATP-induced sustained [ca<sup>2+</sup>]<sub>cyt</sub> elevation.

The research by Kesten et al. suggested an important role of the ATP level in apoplast that was targeted by the fungal pathogen Fusarium oxysporum. The authors proposed that the fungal pathogen releases Ado to regulate the eATP-induced plant defense during infection. There are only a few case studies regarding the Ado function in plants by Roux's group and Mohlmann's group where its mode of action has long been unclear as a negative regulator of the eATP signaling. Thus, the topic in the authors' manuscript has great potential to open up a new field of study in a regulatory mechanism of purinergic signaling in plants.</p><p>Weaknesses:</p><p>The discussion in the manuscript was incoherent and scarce, especially regarding their inconsistent results. For example, Ado inhibited the eATP-induced defense, whereas it further enhanced eATP-induced calcium elevation and alkalinization. An experiment was conducted under the assumption of high Ado in a mutant (ent3nsh3), while the actual level of Ado in the mutant was comparable with that in the wild-type plant. The authors need to make convincing explanations.</p></disp-quote><p>Many thanks for your comments. We have expanded and modified the discussion of our data in context with the current literature. We paid particular attention on the two main concerns you and the other Reviewers address: (1) “Ado inhibited the eATP-induced defense, whereas it further enhanced eATP-induced calcium elevation and alkalinization” and (2) “An experiment was conducted under the assumption of high Ado in a mutant (ent3nsh3), while the actual level of Ado in the mutant was comparable with that in the wild-type plant”. Please, see our detailed responses below. We do hope that these explanations address your concerns satisfactorily.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>I would like to support the study in the manuscript by Kesten et al., given the impact of the topic and the scientific merits of the authors' discovery of the novel function of Ado in plant-pathogen interaction.

In addition, the discussion in the manuscript was incoherent and scarce.</p></disp-quote><p>Thank you for your willingness to support our study. We have modified the text and hope now you find it coherent and complete.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>The experiments using the ent3nsh3 mutant were performed under the assumption of the high level of endogenous Ado accumulated in the mutant. If this is the case, the effect of eATP could be nullified without the exogenous application of Ado. Moreover, Figure 2D showed that it was not actually a high level of Ado accumulated in the mutant. The authors are also recognizing that the eAdo level in ent3nsh3 was not remarkably different in comparison to WT (Line 229-231). Unfortunately, all experiments using the mutant are not actually supporting the authors' conclusions in Figure 2-5.</p></disp-quote><p>Many thanks for pointing out this discrepancy. Indeed, Daumann et al. (2015) detected increased apoAdo levels in leaves of this mutant compared to WT ones only of soil-grown, but not hydroponically-grown plants. This work shows that higher levels of endogenous Ado in <italic>ent3nsh3</italic> organs cannot be assumed. We have reworded the text to clarify these data and to point out the limitations of the material available.</p><p>Our data, indeed, showed no differences between <italic>ent3nsh3</italic> and WT secreted Ado by roots of mock plants grown hydroponically. On the other hand, we show that the apoplastic Ado/ATP ratio is higher in the mutant than in WT. Moreover, upon Fo5176 infection, we detect a significant increase in apoAdo and Ado/ATP ratio in <italic>ent3nsh3</italic> compared to WT roots. These apoplastic purinergic imbalance might explain the different responses of <italic>ent3nsh3</italic> to Fo5176 infection and eAdo treatments, supporting our conclusions in Figures 2-5. We have included an Ado/ATP ratio graph in Figure 2 (Figure 2D) and rewrote the discussion accordingly.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>The authors did applaudable work isolating Ado as a potential inhibitor of eATP signaling out of a compound mix secreted from the fungal pathogen. However, validation of the Ado secretion from the fungi was not substantially demonstrated. Data only with gene expression measurement (Figures 1B and 1C) are just suggestive but not conclusive. Does the enzymatic activity of Fo5'NT (or FoENT) always correlate with its transcription? Does the protein level correlate with the transcription level of a fungal enzyme gene? Does an experiment using an isotope directly support the authors' conclusion?</p></disp-quote><p>Many thanks for recognizing the chemical effort behind the Ado isolation from the fungal compound mix.</p><p>We did aim to fully demonstrate the Ado secretion by Fo5176 by generating Fo5176 mutants unable to secrete Ado (<italic>FoΔE5’NT</italic> and <italic>FoΔENT</italic>). Unfortunately, as we described in the Results section, these efforts failed, most probably due to the vital importance of this process for fungal viability. The upregulation of these fungal genes during root colonisation, while the expression of the plant homologs is not altered, suggest an activation of the Ado secretion in Fo5176 inside the host. These data are supported by the identification of Fo5’NT protein (g8638) in the secretome of Fo5176infected roots of hydroponically-grown Col-0 plants (Gámez-Arjona et al., 2022). We have included this relevant information in the new version and we deeply thank the reviewer for the advice.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>It is well known that elevation of cytosolic calcium level is important to induce plant defense response. If eAdo is hypothesized to suppress the eATP-induced defense response, it is expected to reduce the calcium response. However, the authors showed that Ado further enhanced the calcium response, which is not consistent with Ado's inhibitory effect on eATP-induced defense response against the fungal pathogen. It does not make sense at all and the authors did not discuss it in the manuscript. Is it possible to demonstrate that the increased cytosolic calcium level suppresses the defense response and genuinely contributes to the susceptibility against fungal infection?</p></disp-quote><p>Our data show that Ado only alters the ATP-induced rapid [ca<sup>2+</sup>]<sub>cyt</sub> transient peak but not the ATP-induced sustained [ca<sup>2+</sup>]<sub>cyt</sub> elevation (Figure 3B).

However, there are still other possibilities to be tested on how eAdo suppresses eATP signaling. Ado could act as an antagonist and compete with ATP over the DORN1 receptor. It is also possible that eAdo may directly regulate apoplastic enzymes, e.g., ecto-apyrase/E-NTPDase, E5'NT, or another phosphatase, thereby indirectly controlling eATP homeostasis.</p></disp-quote><p>Many thanks for these suggestions. We have included these hypotheses in the Discussion of the new version. In addition, we have added the data published by Choi et al.

We agree on the need to clarify these terms. “Elicitor” is “a substance that induces a reaction from an organism”. As such, it is not only related to defence responses. Thus we refer to the fungal compound mix as “elicitor mix” because it does induce a reaction from the plant. Indeed, based on our data, the Ado secreted by Fo5176 inside the root can be considered a fungal “effector”. Thanks for the suggestion.

ATP is a strong anion and it might have a significant impact on pH in the media. Root growth is known to be sensitive to pH.

(2016) and ourselves, the dynamic change of the apoplastic pH is essential during Fo infection. A buffered media alters the plant-microbe interaction. Preventing pH changing will affect many molecular aspects of the infection and, thus, will not be informative. Indeed, ATP in pure water results in a mildly acidic pH around 3.5 because its phosphate groups are weakly acidic with pK values in the physiological range.

This novel perspective on the regulation of purinergic signaling in plants has the potential to open up a new field of study. The authors' research demonstrated the important role of eAdo in controlling the eATP/eAdo ratio in the apoplast and its influence on eATP-mediated plant defense responses. The findings suggest that altering this ratio can enhance susceptibility to pathogens, offering valuable insights into the plant's immune response mechanisms. Despite its promising insights, the manuscript leaves certain aspects unresolved, particularly concerning the precise mechanisms of how eAdo is perceived and the exact impact of eATP/eAdo ratio on plant responses to eATP. Further research and exploration are needed for a full understanding of these mechanisms and can be pursued in the future.</p><p>The authors have made significant improvements to the original manuscript.

For example, in Figure 1D, an ATP/Ado ratio of 1:2 appears to inhibit eATP-induced resistance. Moreover, at an ATP/Ado ratio of 1:5, eATP-induced pH elevation is suppressed, while a ratio of 1:20 enhances the pH elevation caused by eATP. What might offer a reasonable explanation for the relationship between pH changes and the defense mechanism triggered by eATP?</p></disp-quote><p>Our short-term response data suggest that the rapid apoplastic alkalization generated by eATP is not a main contributor to plant defence against Fo5176, as (1) eAdo boosts this plant response potentially leading to increased fungal virulence (Figure 1D and 4B), and (2) eATP also generates a pH<sub>apo</sub> peak in the Fo5172 susceptible mutant ent3nsh3, similar to WT plants. It was previously reported that eATP induces defence-related gene expression independently of its effect on media pH (Jewell et al., 2019). However, more research is needed to clarify the relationship between pH changes and the defence mechanism triggered by eATP, and MAMPs/DAMPs/elicitors in general, in the process of an infection. We have included these comments in the discussion.</p><p>About the effect of the different externally altered ATP/Ado ratio in plant responses, we think it is important to keep in mind that we can not numerically compare the results from plate infection assays with that we observe in short response analysis of pH<sub>apo</sub> changes. In the plate infection assays, Ado and ATP were dissolved in the media where the plants grew for 7 days and Fo5176 increased the apoplastic Ado level during the infection (see Figure 2D WT mock vs infected, among other data). The pH<sub>apo</sub> rapid changes induced by different ATP/Ado were tested in 10 min assays, in a concrete area of the root, and without additional effects caused by a pathogen. As the media surrounding plants colonised by Fo strongly alkalizes during the infection (Masachis et al., 2016; Kesten et al., 2019), we hypothesise that the ATP/Ado levels reach the ratio above which there is a boost of ATP-induced alkalization in our plate-infection assays. Thanks to your question we have realised that the sentence in the Discussion “Indeed, a minimum amount of eAdo is required to block the ATP-induced plant resistance to Fo5176 (Figure 1D and S2)” is not correct and have decided to remove it.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Reviewer #3 (Recommendations for the authors):</p><p>I still think that a PCR confirmation of the mutans used (lack of transcript) would strengthen the work.</p></disp-quote><p>All mutants have been characterised before, so we do not think a reconfirmation to be necessary.
