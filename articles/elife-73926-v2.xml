colorectal cancer (CRC) cells exhibit a mucin hypersecretory phenotype, which is suggested to provide resistance to immune surveillance and chemotherapy. We now formally show that CRC cells build a barrier to chemotherapeutics by increasing mucins’ secretion. We show that low levels of KChIP3, a negative regulator of mucin secretion (Cantero-Recasens et al., 2018), is a risk factor for CRC patients’ relapse in a subset of untreated tumours. Our results also reveal that cells depleted of KChIP3 are four times more resistant (measured as cell viability and DNA damage) to chemotherapeutics 5-fluorouracil + irinotecan (5-FU+iri.) compared to control cells, whereas KChIP3-overexpressing cells are 10 times more sensitive to killing by chemotherapeutics. A similar increase in tumour cell death is observed upon chemical inhibition of mucin secretion by the sodium/calcium exchanger (NCX) blockers (Mitrovic et al., 2013). Finally, sensitivity of CRC patient-derived organoids to 5-FU+iri. increases 40-fold upon mucin secretion inhibition. Reducing mucin secretion thus provides a means to control chemoresistance of mucinous CRC cells and other mucinous tumours.</p></abstract><kwd-group kwd-group-type="author-keywords"><kwd>chemotherapy</kwd><kwd>colorectal cancer</kwd><kwd>mucins</kwd><kwd>KChIP3</kwd><kwd>chemoresistance</kwd><kwd>5-FU+iri.</kwd></kwd-group><kwd-group kwd-group-type="research-organism"><title>Research organism</title><kwd>Human</kwd></kwd-group><funding-group><award-group id="fund1"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100010198</institution-id><institution>Ministerio de Economía, Industria y Competitividad, Gobierno de España</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>BFU2013-44188-P</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Malhotra</surname><given-names>Vivek</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund2"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100004587</institution-id><institution>Instituto de Salud Carlos III</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>PI19-00013</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Espinosa</surname><given-names>Lluis</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><funding-statement>The funders had no role in study design, data collection and interpretation, or the decision to submit the work for publication.</funding-statement></funding-group><custom-meta-group><custom-meta specific-use="meta-only"><meta-name>Author impact statement</meta-name><meta-value>Genetic analysis and biochemical approaches reveal that chemorefractory properties are reversed by inhibiting mucin secretion, thus providing a means to curb the growth and spread of colorectal cancer.</meta-value></custom-meta></custom-meta-group></article-meta></front><body><sec id="s1" sec-type="intro"><title>Introduction</title><p>Secreted mucins are synthesized in the endoplasmic reticulum (ER) and transported to the Golgi apparatus, where they receive extensive O-glycosylation that increases their molecular weight by about fivefold. These heavily glycosylated mucins are then packed into specialized micrometre-sized granules where they can reach molecular weights of up to 50 MDa (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Sheehan et al., 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Thornton et al., 2008</xref>). These granules mature by a process that involves mucin condensation, and, finally, a small number of granules fuse to plasma membrane in a calcium-dependent manner to release the required quantity of mucins in the extracellular space (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Adler et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Rossi et al., 2004</xref>). Specifically, mucins are secreted by two main processes: (1) extracellular calcium-dependent pathway called stimulated secretion, which is triggered by an exogenous agonist; and (2) intracellular calcium-dependent release, but independent of external agonists, called baseline secretion. It has recently been shown that cooperation between TRPM4/5 sodium channels and the Na<sup>+</sup>/Ca<sup>2+</sup> exchangers (NCX) controls stimulated secretion (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Mitrovic et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Cantero-Recasens et al., 2019</xref>). The calcium-binding protein KChIP3, on the other hand, regulates baseline secretion (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Cantero-Recasens et al., 2018</xref>).</p><p>The secreted mucins compose the mucus that protects the underlying epithelium from toxins, pathogens, and allergens (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Kesimer et al., 2013</xref>). Secretion of the right quantity and quality of mucins is crucial because mucin hypersecretion in the airways is linked to chronic obstructive diseases and hyposecretion makes the underlying tissue more susceptible to damage by the immune cells and the foreign particles (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Thornton et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Pelaseyed et al., 2014</xref>). Most cancer cells start expressing mucins, and it is widely thought that they isolate tumour cells from the immune system and also render them resistant to anticancer therapies (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Kufe, 2009</xref>). Indeed, treatment with O-glycosylation inhibitors (benzyl-α-GalNAc) increases the effectiveness of chemotherapy on pancreatic cells overexpressing the transmembrane mucin MUC1 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Kalra and Campbell, 2007</xref>). But whether this is due to inhibition of MUC1 glycosylation only or any of the other O-glycosylated proteins is not known. Patients with mucinous colorectal adenocarcinoma (10–15% of colorectal cancer [CRC]; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Luo et al., 2019</xref>), however, present dysregulated mucin secretion that is long associated with high resistance to chemotherapy. In fact, extracellular mucins account for at least 50% of the volume of these tumours (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Hugen et al., 2016</xref>). Whether or not controlling the levels of mucins secreted by cancer cells affects their susceptibility to chemotherapeutics, however, remains untested. Here, we have studied this question directly in CRC cell lines and organoids derived from a CRC patient and show that reducing mucin secretion reverses the chemorefractory properties of hypersecretory CRC cells.</p></sec><sec id="s2" sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><sec id="s2-1"><title>5-Fluorouracil + irinotecan treatment induces mucin production</title><p>15–20% of CRCs develop a mucinous profile (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Luo et al., 2019</xref>), which renders cancer cells highly resistant to commonly used chemotherapies, such as 5-fluorouracil + irinotecan (5-FU+ iri.) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Van Cutsem et al., 2016</xref>). To study the contribution of secreted mucins to CRC chemorefraction, we used the HT29 CRC cell line (clones HT29-18N2 and HT29-M6) that are differentiated into mucin-producing cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Mitrovic et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Mayo et al., 2007</xref>).</p><p>We first tested the effect of 5-FU + iri. on mucin production, focusing on secreted mucins, which are the main macrocomponents of the mucus layer (i.e. MUC5AC) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Thornton et al., 2008</xref>). Briefly, differentiated HT29-M6 cells were treated with 5-FU + iri. (50 μg/mL 5-fluorouracil + 20 μg/mL irinotecan diluted in normal tissue culture medium) and MUC5AC levels monitored over time (0, 1, 3, 6, and 24 hr) by Western blot (WB) (scheme in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1A</xref>). Our results reveal that 5-FU + iri. treatment strongly increases MUC5AC intracellular levels (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1A</xref>). To further confirm this effect, 5-FU + iri.-treated HT29-M6 cells (24 hr) were imaged by confocal immunofluorescence microscopy. Accordingly, we found that 5-FU + iri.-treated cells present a clear increase in MUC5AC level compared to control cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1B</xref>). These results suggest that increased production of mucins after 5-FU + iri. treatment could act as a barrier to chemical permeation, thus enhancing chemorefraction of mucosecretory cancer subtypes.</p><fig-group><fig id="fig1" position="float"><label>Figure 1.</label><caption><title>Mucins in colorectal cancer.</title><p>(<bold>A</bold>) Cell lysates from differentiated HT29-M6 cells treated with 5-fluorouracil + irinotecan (5-FU + iri.)

After 30 min, cells were divided into two groups: one group was extensively washed with isotonic solution to remove the mucin fibres, while the other group was subjected to mild washes to preserve these fibres. Next, cells were incubated with Alexa Fluor 488-labelled albumin for 1 hr, processed for confocal immunofluorescence microscopy and stained with anti-MUC5AC antibody. As shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1C</xref>, mucins act as a barrier that prevents the endocytosis of albumin by HT29-M6 cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1C</xref>, upper panel). Contrarily, removal of mucin fibres allows the contact and uptake of albumin by cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1C</xref>, lower panel). Quantification of the images using the Fiji software revealed that in the presence of mucin fibres albumin colocalizes with MUC5AC (Manders’ coefficient albumin-MUC5AC: 0.16 vs. 0.01, p=0.01), whereas in cells without mucin barrier, albumin is found intracellularly (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1D</xref>). Altogether, these data demonstrate that colonic cancer cells produce higher levels of MUC5AC in response to chemotherapy treatment, which form a barrier that protects cells from incorporation of extracellular compounds. We anticipated that MUC5AC may act as a barrier against chemotherapy in human CRC tumours, and as a consequence, it could represent a prognostic biomarker for CRC.</p><p>Analysis of CRC subtypes, using the consensus molecular subgroup (CMS) classification from <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Guinney et al., 2015</xref>, indicated a radically different distribution of high and low MUC5AC-expressing tumours among subtypes: CMS1 (28% vs. 10%), CMS2 (15% vs. 41%), CMS3 (36% vs. 6%), and CMS4 (5% vs. 26%) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1E</xref>). Importantly, both CMS1 (associated with immune evasion) and CMS3 (metabolic dysregulation and goblet cell markers enrichment) have worse prognosis than CMS2 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Guinney et al., 2015</xref>), which include the majority of tumours with low MUC5AC expression. These results point to an important role of MUC5AC in the prognosis of CRC patients. To directly assess this possibility, we evaluated whether MUC5AC expression levels discriminate patients’ outcome in a well-annotated CRC cohort (GSE14333, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Jorissen et al., 2009</xref>). Importantly, although this public database does not include information on chemotherapy treatment, we could analyse the disease-free survival (DFS) of patients depending on the gene-expression levels, a parameter that is related to tumour chemoresistance. However, DFS analysis revealed no significant differences between patients with high or low MUC5AC levels (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1F</xref>), strongly suggesting that factors controlling mucin secretion, and not only intracellular mucin levels, might be relevant biomarkers for CRC prognosis.</p></sec><sec id="s2-2"><title>The mucin regulator KChIP3 is a risk factor for CRC with high MUC5AC expression</title><p>Mucin secretion can be triggered by an external agonist (stimulated secretion), such as ATP and allergens, or in the absence of external agonists (baseline secretion) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Adler et al., 2013</xref>). We have shown previously that KChIP3, an intracellular calcium sensor, negatively controls baseline mucin secretion (loss of KChIP3 causes mucin hypersecretion) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Cantero-Recasens et al., 2018</xref>). So, we checked whether KChIP3 could be a prognostic biomarker for CRC. Analysis of DFS of patients according to KChIP3 levels, encoded by the <italic>KCNIP3</italic> gene, revealed that KChIP3 is, indeed, a prognostic factor (hazard ratio [HR] = 1.925, p=0.02) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2A</xref>). To further confirm whether this effect is related to mucins, patients were divided between high (n = 73) and low (n = 153) MUC5AC expression levels, and then we studied the effect of KChIP3 on the DFS of patients. Our analysis reveals that low levels of KChIP3 are a clear risk factor in those patients with high MUC5AC levels (HR = 3.29, p=0.04) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2B</xref>). There is no significant effect on patients with low MUC5AC expression (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2C</xref>), although after 100 months there is a decrease in DFS. Further analysis of this effect revealed that three patients (GSM358532, GSM358534, and GSM358438) were responsible for this effect. We studied these patients in more detail, and interestingly, although they have low levels of MUC5AC, these patients present increased levels of other secreted mucins (e.g., MUC2) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s1">Figure 2—figure supplement 1A</xref>). However, similarly to previous studies (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Kufe, 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Luo et al., 2019</xref>), analysis of the effect of MUC2 levels on DFS shows that high MUC2 levels are protective while patients with low levels of MUC2, which may reflect a more dedifferentiated state of cancer cells, have a lower DFS (HR = 2.54, p=0.023) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s1">Figure 2—figure supplement 1B</xref>). Importantly, when we studied the effect of KChIP3 on the DFS of patients with high expression of MUC2, we found a clear tendency (p=0.08) to worse prognosis in patients with low levels of KChIP3 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s1">Figure 2—figure supplement 1C</xref>). Altogether, these results suggest that low levels of KChIP3, which consequently increase the quantity of mucins secreted, protect cancer cells from chemotherapeutic drugs.</p><fig-group><fig id="fig2" position="float"><label>Figure 2.</label><caption><title>KChIP3 is a prognostic marker of colorectal cancer (CRC).</title><p>(<bold>A–C</bold>) Disease-free survival (DFS) according to KChIP3 levels of CRC patients (low KChIP3 levels, n = 120; high KChIP3 levels, n = 106) (<bold>A</bold>), CRC patients with high MUC5AC levels (low KChIP3 levels, n = 39; high KChIP3 levels, n = 34) (<bold>B</bold>), or CRC with low MUC5AC levels (low KChIP3 levels, n = 81; high KChIP3 levels, n = 72) (<bold>C</bold>).

Analyses of images using Fiji software (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Schindelin et al., 2012</xref>) revealed that cells treated with 5-FU + iri. contained significantly fewer MUC5AC-containing particles than control cells (75.7 vs. 100.7 particles/field, p=0.002) with a reduced average size (1.12 µm<sup>3</sup> vs. 2.48 µm<sup>3</sup>) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3C</xref>, quantification in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3D</xref>). It is important to note that this anti-MUC5AC antibody mainly recognizes the mature mucin granules (close to the plasma membrane, as shown in <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Cantero-Recasens et al., 2018</xref>), which can explain the apparent contradiction with the effect of 5-FU + iri. treatment on mucin production (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1</xref>).

We obtained cell lysates at different time points (0, 1, 3, and 6 hr) after treatment and then measured the levels of MUC5AC and γH2AX by WB. Our results confirmed that SN-6 leads to MUC5AC intracellular accumulation over time in 5-FU + iri.-treated cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4A</xref>, first lane), which correlated with a slight increase in γH2AX levels (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4A</xref>, second lane).

Importantly, the first time point (time 0) represents HT29 cells not treated with 5-FU + iri. or mucin secretion inhibitors (scheme in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s1">Figure 4—figure supplement 1A</xref>). Thus, our results revealed that 5-FU + iri treatment caused an increase in mucin secretion (60–80% compared to time 0), which was blocked by SN-6 (relative levels: 1.8 vs. 1.0, respectively) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4A</xref>). Next, to validate the increase in DNA damage, differentiated HT29-M6 cells were treated with vehicle (control), 5-FU + iri.

These proteins are the major macrocomponents of the mucus layer, which is a physical barrier that protects the underlying tissue from external insults (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Cone, 2009</xref>). Importantly, the combination of different mucins and the type of secretion (baseline or stimulated) modulates the properties of the mucus layer to meet the tissue demands. For instance, baseline secretion is the prominent pathway that maintains the colonic mucus layer, while stimulated is the main pathway to rapidly protect the epithelium after allergen or toxic challenge in the airways (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">Zhu et al., 2015</xref>). Accordingly, tight regulation of mucin quantities and composition is essential for the correct functioning of the mucus. Alterations in their synthesis or release are, therefore, hallmarks of several pathological situations like severe asthma or CRC. Hyperproduction of mucin in some subtypes of CRC leads to enhanced chemoresistance of cancer cells, thereby reducing patients’ survival (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Pothuraju et al., 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Jin et al., 2017</xref>). However, in some cases, decreased expression of secreted mucins (i.e. MUC2 and MUC5AC) is an indicator of more aggressive colorectal tumour, possibly because these cells are more dedifferentiated and thus more invasive (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Luo et al., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Kocer et al., 2002</xref>). Interestingly, inhibition of O-glycosylation renders pancreatic cancers overexpressing the transmembrane mucin MUC1 more sensitive to 5-FU (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Kalra and Campbell, 2007</xref>). Transmembrane mucins contribute to chemoresistance by inhibiting apoptosis or promoting epithelial to mesenchymal transition (EMT) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">van Putten and Strijbis, 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Jonckheere et al., 2014</xref>). But the role of secreted mucins in chemoresistance to CRC has not been explored. The chemicals and proteins employed here affect both MUC2 and MUC5AC as shown previously (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Cantero-Recasens et al., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Cantero-Recasens et al., 2018</xref>), but for the sake of simplicity we have monitored only the effects on MUC5AC secretion.</p><sec id="s3-1"><title>Cancer cells produce mucins as a protective response to chemotherapy</title><p>Our data show that CRC cells produce mucins in response to 5-FU + iri., a first-choice chemotherapy for most CRC (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Kamnerdsupaphon et al., 2007</xref>). Besides, 5-FU + iri. not only increases mucin production, but also increases mucin secretion (70–80% after 6 hr). This increase in secretion is completely blocked by SN-6 treatment (as described previously in <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Cantero-Recasens et al., 2019</xref>). This is extremely important because secreted mucins can create a physical barrier that could prevent drugs (for instance, chemotherapeutics) from reaching the tumour cells. Another possibility is that 5-FU + iri. is actively retained by mucin fibres. The availability of tagged versions of these chemicals will help to address this issue in the future.</p><p>Our results in PDOs and cell lines show that cancer cells respond to chemotherapeutics by secreting copious amounts of mucin to form a barrier against the treatment. We suggest that this reaction (mucin secretion) of CRC cells to chemotherapy is similar to the programmed response of epithelial cells to toxics or pathogens. In this situation, which could resemble the treatment with 5-FU + iri., mucin-producing cells would release large quantities of mucins to isolate them from the insults (toxins, allergens, or pathogens) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Adler et al., 2013</xref>). An interesting question is how 5-FU + iri. triggers mucin secretion and whether there is a specific receptor involved in this response or an intracellular pathway that is activated by these chemicals. This finding is important in the application of chemotherapeutics and merits further investigation. Our results show that this increase in mucin production/secretion triggered by chemotherapeutics is independent of transcriptional effects on mucins, although we cannot completely discard the possibility that the levels of components necessary for mucin modification and secretion (e.g., glycosyltransferases) are altered.</p></sec><sec id="s3-2"><title>KChIP3, a novel risk factor for mucinous CRC</title><p>We postulated that mucin levels could be used as prognostic biomarkers for CRC. Our gene-expression analyses of a public CRC cohort, however, revealed that mucin levels do not reflect the prognosis of CRC patients. Although surprising, this is not totally unexpected because mucin secretion is an extremely well-regulated process to prevent pathological situations. Therefore, high intracellular levels do not directly translate to increased extracellular levels. Our gene-expression data reveal that low level of KChIP3, which negatively regulates baseline secretion (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Cantero-Recasens et al., 2018</xref>), is an important risk factor for untreated tumours with high MUC5AC expression levels. We have found that cells with low levels of KChIP3 (that corresponds to more mucin secretion) are more resistant to 5-FU + iri. To summarize, low levels of KChIP3 promote mucin secretion, which is even more dramatic in tumours with high expression of MUC5AC. Increased mucin secretion protects cancer cells from chemotherapy, which drastically reduce CRC patients’ DFS. KChIP3 thus emerges as a good prognostic marker, although it may have low relevance as a therapeutic target because it necessitates the use of gene therapy to enhance its expression and block mucin secretion. An exciting option is to target factors that control KChIP3 activity, such as ryanodine receptors or quenchers of intracellular calcium (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Cantero-Recasens et al., 2018</xref>).</p></sec><sec id="s3-3"><title>Combined treatment with NCX inhibitors improves chemotherapy efficacy</title><p>Mucinous cancers present higher chemoresistance than other subtypes of CRC (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Luo et al., 2019</xref>). As suggested by several authors and now shown by our experimental data, secreted mucins can act as a barrier to external insults including chemotherapeutic drugs. In fact, genetic regulation of this secretion by modulating KChIP3 levels renders cancer cells more sensitive to treatment. However, our results also demonstrate that 5-FU + iri. is a stimulus for mucin secretion, which may be an adaptive response of cancer cells for isolation from harmful environment. This unexpected effect can explain how some cancer cells become more resistant to treatment over time.</p><p>Stimulated mucin secretion, by colonic or airways cells, depends on extracellular calcium entry through the reverse mode of NCX (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Mitrovic et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Cantero-Recasens et al., 2019</xref>). Our data show that inhibition of stimulated mucin secretion reduces the resistance of tumour cells to anticancer treatments. Both NCX inhibitors (benzamil and SN-6) prevent the effect of 5-FU + iri. on mucin secretion. On the other hand, co-treatment with NCX inhibitors improves the apoptotic effect of 5-FU + iri. on cancer cells, even at low 5-FU + iri. concentrations (IC20). However, one of the main problems of NCX inhibitors is their low specificity and the effects on cardiac function. To avoid these problems, SN-6 was developed as a specific inhibitor of NCX reverse mode that at working concentration does not affect other receptors, transporters, or ion channels, and has less side effects than benzamil (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Niu et al., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Iwamoto et al., 2004</xref>). Our results reveal the potential therapeutic importance of SN-6. Finally, it is satisfying to note that the effect of SN-6 on the chemotherapy sensitivity of cancer cells is replicated in PDOs.</p></sec><sec id="s3-4"><title>Conclusions</title><p>In conclusion, CRC cells produce mucins to create a protective environment against chemotherapy treatments. Blocking mucin secretion by genetic (altering KChIP3 levels) or chemical means (using NCX inhibitors) renders tumour cells more sensitive to anticancer therapies. In addition, we have identified the mucin secretion regulator KChIP3 as a novel risk factor for mucinous CRC, which could be used as a prognostic biomarker. We have provided potential new pharmacological strategies to control chemorefraction of mucinous CRCs, but this approach is likely to benefit patients with mucinous cancers in general.</p></sec></sec><sec id="s4" sec-type="materials|methods"><title>Materials and methods</title><table-wrap id="keyresource" position="anchor"><label>Key resources table</label><table frame="hsides" rules="groups"><thead><tr><th align="left" valign="bottom">Reagent type (species) or resource</th><th align="left" valign="bottom">Designation</th><th align="left" valign="bottom">Source or reference</th><th align="left" valign="bottom">Identifiers</th><th align="left" valign="bottom">Additional information</th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td align="left" valign="bottom">Gene (<italic>Homo sapiens</italic>)</td><td align="left" valign="bottom">MUC5AC</td><td align="left" valign="bottom">Ensembl</td><td align="left" valign="bottom">ENSG00000215182</td><td align="left" valign="bottom"/></tr><tr><td align="left" valign="bottom">Gene (<italic>H. sapiens</italic>)</td><td align="left" valign="bottom">MUC2</td><td align="left" valign="bottom">Ensembl</td><td align="left" valign="bottom">ENSG00000198788</td><td align="left" valign="bottom"/></tr><tr><td align="left" valign="bottom">Gene (<italic>H. sapiens</italic>)</td><td align="left" valign="bottom">MUC6</td><td align="left" valign="bottom">Ensembl</td><td align="left" valign="bottom">ENSG00000184956</td><td align="left" valign="bottom"/></tr><tr><td align="left" valign="bottom">Gene (<italic>H. sapiens</italic>)</td><td align="left" valign="bottom">MUC5B</td><td align="left" valign="bottom">Ensembl</td><td align="left" valign="bottom">ENSG00000117983</td><td align="left" valign="bottom"/></tr><tr><td align="left" valign="bottom">Gene (<italic>H. sapiens</italic>)</td><td align="left" valign="bottom">MUC19</td><td align="left" valign="bottom">Ensembl</td><td align="left" valign="bottom">ENSG00000205592</td><td align="left" valign="bottom"/></tr><tr><td align="left" valign="bottom">Gene (<italic>H. sapiens</italic>)</td><td align="left" valign="bottom">KCNIP3</td><td align="left" valign="bottom">Ensembl</td><td align="left" valign="bottom">ENSG00000115041</td><td align="left" valign="bottom"/></tr><tr><td align="left" valign="bottom">Cell line (<italic>H. sapiens</italic>)</td><td align="left" valign="bottom">HT29-M6</td><td align="left" valign="bottom">ATCC</td><td align="left" valign="bottom">CVCL_G077</td><td align="left" valign="bottom">Mycoplasma free</td></tr><tr><td align="left" valign="bottom">Cell line (<italic>H. sapiens</italic>)</td><td align="left" valign="bottom">HT29-18N2</td><td align="left" valign="bottom">ATCC</td><td align="left" valign="bottom">CVCL_5942</td><td align="left" valign="bottom">Mycoplasma free</td></tr><tr><td align="left" valign="bottom">Antibody</td><td align="left" valign="bottom">Anti-MUC5AC (mouse monoclonal)</td><td align="left" valign="bottom">Neomarkers,Waltham, MA</td><td align="left" valign="bottom">Clone 45M1</td><td align="char" char="." valign="bottom">(1:1000)</td></tr><tr><td align="left" valign="bottom">Antibody</td><td align="left" valign="bottom">Anti-γH2A.X (mouse monoclonal)</td><td align="left" valign="bottom">Cell Signaling</td><td align="left" valign="bottom">#2577</td><td align="char" char="." valign="bottom">(1:1000)</td></tr><tr><td align="left" valign="bottom">Commercial assay or kit</td><td align="left" valign="bottom">CometAssay Trevigen Kit</td><td align="left" valign="bottom">Trevigen</td><td align="char" char="ndash" valign="bottom">250-050K</td><td align="left" valign="bottom"/></tr><tr><td align="left" valign="bottom">Chemical compound, drug</td><td align="left" valign="bottom">SN-6</td><td align="left" valign="bottom">Sigma-Aldrich</td><td align="left" valign="bottom">SML1937-5MG</td><td align="left" valign="bottom">(5 µM)</td></tr><tr><td align="left" valign="bottom">Chemical compound, drug</td><td align="left" valign="bottom">Benzamil</td><td align="left" valign="bottom">Sigma-Aldrich</td><td align="left" valign="bottom">B2417-10MG</td><td align="left" valign="bottom">5 µM</td></tr></tbody></table></table-wrap><sec id="s4-1"><title>Bioinformatics analysis</title><p>Transcriptomic and available clinical data dataset from CRC was downloaded from the open-access resource CANCERTOOL.

Your article has been reviewed by 2 peer reviewers, and the evaluation has been overseen by a Reviewing Editor and Suzanne Pfeffer as the Senior Editor. The following individual involved in review of your submission has agreed to reveal their identity: Benjamin S Glick (Reviewer #2).</p><p>The reviewers have discussed their reviews with one another and essential points are listed below.</p><p>Essential revisions:</p><p>1. Additional data supporting mucus secretion as a mechanism for effects of chemotherapy would be necessary to support the main conclusions of the paper. To conclude an inhibitory effect of secreted mucus on the accessibility of the drugs, mucus secretion and reduced drug accessibility by mucus must be demonstrated by relevant analyses.</p><p>2. Regarding chemotherapeutic drugs increasing mucin secretion: it is obvious why that response aids the tumor cells, but not obvious why tumor cells are programmed to respond in that way. Please address this question.</p><p><italic>Reviewer #1 (Recommendations for the authors):</italic></p><p>Some suggestions mostly linked to the points raised in the public review that could improve the study.</p><p>The contribution from other mucins in the CRC survival analysis and in the cell expression and secretion studies would be of importance as the impact of them might influence the outcome. Complementing any staining of intracellular and secreted mucus with a general mucin staining approach (possibly by utilizing the glycans) would possibly give a more comprehensive view.</p><p>The mucus secretion in cell lines will be impacted by cell proliferation, survival and polarization that are all important factors to monitor and show or discuss to reveal how they were accounted for.</p><p>To conclude an inhibitory effect of secreted mucus on the accessibility of the drugs, mucus secretion and reduced drug accessibility by mucus must be demonstrated by relevant analyses. Mucus secretion is preferably assessed by complementary methods monitoring intracellular vesicles using microscopy and measuring secreted mucus using dotblot, a method previously performed by the group. As the FOLFIRI treatment induce cell death, contamination of mucus from dead or detached cells will contribute, but a relative comparison to the amount of any general intracellular protein in the samples could shed light on the size of this fraction. Another option is to separate the secreted reduced mucus on more porous gel-types to estimate the amount of the not fully glycosylated material compared to the fully glycosylated secreted mucins. The effect on transcript expression would add a nice complement to these studies deciphering the transcriptional element of mucus production. Assessment of mucus secretion upon modulation of the FOLFIRI effect by KChipP3 expression levels or Benzamil and SN-6 treatment would be required to provide a functional link to mucus.</p><p>Assessing mucus release in the organoids would strengthen the argument substantially. Mucus staining of fixed samples could be explored.</p><p>As the overall basis of the study is the link between mucin secretion and CRC treatment efficacy it would be good if the patient material could be stratified by treatment with separation of groups based on mucin expression and the related genes.</p><p>The rationale for using two different HT-29 clones should be explained.</p><p><italic>Reviewer #2 (Recommendations for the authors):</italic></p><p>1. In Figure 1 and other figures, the abbreviation &quot;FOLFIRI&quot; is apparently used in place of &quot;5-FU+iri&quot;. The authors should choose one or the other and be consistent.</p><p>2. In Figure 1C, it's hard to tell what we are looking at with albumin. Are endosomes being visualized in the washed cells? What are the labeled structures in the cells with mucin fibers? In Figure 1D, why would albumin overlap with DAPI?</p><p>3. The abbreviation &quot;HR&quot; should be defined. &quot;DSF&quot; in the text should probably be &quot;DFS&quot; as defined in the subsequent sentence. And if &quot;CT&quot; stands for chemotherapy, this abbreviation should be either defined or avoided.</p><p>4.In Figure 2C, is there truly no significant difference? By 100 months, the two populations look radically different. Either something is wrong with the statistics, or the analysis has a problem.</p><p>5. The description of Figure 3B is confusing. The authors seem to say that the combination treatment is effective, then not effective, then effective again. Is the point that the effect becomes visible only after 72 h?</p><p>6. Figure 4A and 4C seem to be contradictory, because Figure 4A shows no significant increase in (g)H2A.X with SN-6 whereas Figure 4C shows a strong increase. Please clarify.</p><p>[Editors' note: further revisions were suggested prior to acceptance, as described below.]</p><p>Thank you for resubmitting your work entitled &quot;Reversing chemorefraction in colorectal cancer cells by controlling mucin secretion&quot; for further consideration by <italic>eLife</italic>. Your revised article has been evaluated by Suzanne Pfeffer (Senior Editor) and a Reviewing Editor.</p><p>The manuscript has been improved but there are some remaining issues that need to be addressed, as outlined below:</p><p>In light of the comments by Reviewer #1 below, the following revisions are requested:</p><p>1. Given that the model is that 5FU+iri increases mucin secretion, direct demonstration of increased mucin secretion (as opposed to mucin vesicle production) upon 5FU+iri treatment vs. vehicle control should be shown. An experiment similar to what is shown in Figure 1C but with 5FU+iri treatment vs vehicle would address this. Also, westerns of Muc5AC from media and cell lysates of vehicle treated vs. 5FU+iri treated (similar to what is shown in Figure 4A) would allow quantitation of this increase and would strengthen the paper.</p><p>2. There is still some confusion over the link between Kchip3 expression, mucin secretion, chemo treatment and CRC patient outcome. The authors presumably already have images showing increased and decreased mucin secretion in the cell lines where kchip3 has been mutated or overexpressed relative to controls-showing these data would greatly strengthen the paper. Additionally, if the authors could include some clarification/discussion that the patient data is based on gene expression rather than mucin secretion, and does not include information on chemotherapy treatment, this may resolve some of the confusion.</p><p><italic>Reviewer #1 (Recommendations for the authors):</italic></p><p>The authors have addressed several of the concerns raised and show nicely that the secreted material does not contain dead or detached cells. They also provide important information on mucin expression upon treatment of cells although the effect of the inhibitor SN6 alone in reducing mucin expression is not discussed. The main issue with secretion is addressed in relation to 5-FU+Iri and SN6 treatment, but not to the most central component of the study, KChiP3, relevant data is however referred to. The secreted mucins are detected by WB at a size of above 450 kDa and as the theoretical size of the naked protein in the range of 580 kDa it indicates to be the secreted product, however with limited glycosylation (a gel stained by Alcian blue would show this). However, the discrepancy in the data on mucus secretion partly remains as the results in Figure 1B, 4A and 4B show enhanced intracellular MUC5AC upon 5-FU+Iri treatment (referred to as production as it is not dependent on expression), but the data in Figure 3C with reduced number and size of vesicles is not in line. Mucus secretion was further analyzed using general staining (Alcian blue) of treated cells and organoids. The data on cells is very hard to interpret while the stained organoid shows secreted mucus. In this context treatment of the organoid with 5-FU+Iri would have been a much better representation of enhanced secretion upon treatment compared to the fixed cells.</p><p>The link between enhanced mucin expression leading poor prognosis for CRC patients and reduced effects of treatment depending on mucus secretion is explained by differentiation, but this is a main concern in the concept and could benefit from even further discussion.<italic>Reviewer #2 (Recommendations for the authors):</italic></p><p>The authors have done a satisfactory job of responding to my previous comments. I support publication of the revised manuscript.</p><p>[Editors' note: further revisions were suggested prior to acceptance, as described below.]</p><p>Thank you for resubmitting your work entitled &quot;Reversing chemorefraction in colorectal cancer cells by controlling mucin secretion&quot; for further consideration by <italic>eLife</italic>. Your revised article has been evaluated by Suzanne Pfeffer (Senior Editor) and a Reviewing Editor.</p><p>We are pleased to notify you that it is now acceptable for publication, provided that the authors include numbers of samples and replicates for all figures (as Figure 4A) and a brief explanation, as given in the response letter, why there is a variation observed in Figure 3C compared to other results presented.</p><p><italic>Reviewer #1 (Recommendations for the authors):</italic></p><p>The manuscript is now improved by text alterations. It is unfortunate that no extra data is provided proving mucus secretion to affect CRC treatment, but the text now includes most of the information needed for proper evaluation by readers. In this context I would find it important to include numbers of samples and replicates for all figures (as Figure 4A) and to include a brief explanation, as given in the response letter, why there is a variation observed in Figure 3C compared to other results presented to be fully transparent. With these additions I do find it acceptable for publication.</p></body></sub-article><sub-article article-type="reply" id="sa2"><front-stub><article-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.73926.sa2</article-id><title-group><article-title>Author response</article-title></title-group></front-stub><body><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Essential revisions:</p><p>1.

Our results show that mucins act as a physical barrier to prevent drug accessibility. In the revised version, we provide new data showing extracellular mucus (staining with Alcian Blue) in cells and PDOs (Figure 4 – Supplement figure 1A and 1C) and show that this effect is independent of transcriptional regulation of mucins (Figure 4 – Supplement figure 1B). In addition, we have added data on mucin secretion by treatment with chemotherapy and NCX inhibitor SN-6 (Figure 4A). These data are now included in the Results section. We also discuss the contribution of secreted mucins on the accessibility of drugs as stated below.</p><p>“Cancer cells produce mucins as a protective response to chemotherapy</p><p>Our data show that CRC cells produce mucins in response to 5-Fluorouracil + Irinotecan (5-FU+iri.), a first-choice chemotherapy for most CRC (30). Besides, 5-FU+iri. not only increases mucin production, but also increases mucin secretion (70-80% after 6 hours). This increase in secretion is completely blocked by SN-6 treatment (as described previously in (6)). This is extremely important, because secreted mucins can create a physical barrier that could prevent drugs (for instance, chemotherapeutics) from reaching the tumour cells. Another possibility is that 5-FU+iri. is actively retained by mucin fibres. The availability of tagged versions of these chemicals will help to address this issue in the future.</p><p>Our results in PDOs and cell lines show that cancer cells respond to chemotherapeutics by secreting copious amounts of mucin to form a barrier against the treatment. We suggest that this reaction (mucin secretion) of colorectal cancer cells to chemotherapy is similar to the programmed response of epithelial cells to toxics or pathogens. In this situation, which could resemble the treatment with 5-FU+iri., mucin-producing cells would release large quantities of mucins to isolate them from the insults (toxins, allergens or pathogens) (3). An interesting question is how 5-FU+iri. triggers mucin secretion and whether there is a specific receptor involved in this response or an intracellular pathway that is activated by these chemicals. This finding is important in application of chemotherapeutics and merits further investigation. Our results show that this increase in mucin production/secretion triggered by chemotherapeutics is independent of transcriptional effects on mucins, although we cannot completely discard the possibility that the levels of components necessary for mucin modification and secretion (e.g., glycosyltransferases) are altered.”</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>2.

Please address this question.</p></disp-quote><p>This is an interesting question. We suggest that this is a programmed response of epithelial cells to toxics or pathogens. In this situation (similar to the change in the environment that cancer cells detect after chemotherapy treatment) mucin-producing cells release huge amounts of mucins to isolate them from the toxins, pathogens or allergens. Interestingly, our new results show that this increase in mucin production and secretion is independent of transcriptional effects (Figure 4 – Supplement figure 1B). We have extended the previous paragraph on this topic in the discussion:</p><p>“We suggest that this reaction (mucin secretion) of colorectal cancer cells to chemotherapy is similar to the programmed response of epithelial cells to toxics or pathogens.

Our results show that this increase in mucin production/secretion triggered by chemotherapeutics is independent of transcriptional effects on mucins, although we cannot completely discard the possibility that the levels of components necessary for mucin modification and secretion (e.g., glycosyltransferases) are altered.”</p><p>We have also included the following for the analysis of MUC5AC transcription in the Results section:</p><p>“In addition, to test for the transcriptional effect of SN-6 on 5-FU+iri. dependent mucin production, we analysed RNA levels of MUC5AC in HT29-M6 cells treated with vehicle (control), 5-FU+iri.

Our results revealed that the increase in mucin production and secretion by 5-FU+iri. and the effect of SN-6 on 5-FU+iri. is independent of MUC5AC transcription (Figure 4 – Supplement figure 1B).”</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Reviewer #1 (Recommendations for the authors):</p><p>Some suggestions mostly linked to the points raised in the public review that could improve the study.</p><p>The contribution from other mucins in the CRC survival analysis and in the cell expression and secretion studies would be of importance as the impact of them might influence the outcome.

Mucus secretion is preferably assessed by complementary methods monitoring intracellular vesicles using microscopy and measuring secreted mucus using dotblot, a method previously performed by the group. As the FOLFIRI treatment induce cell death, contamination of mucus from dead or detached cells will contribute, but a relative comparison to the amount of any general intracellular protein in the samples could shed light on the size of this fraction. Another option is to separate the secreted reduced mucus on more porous gel-types to estimate the amount of the not fully glycosylated material compared to the fully glycosylated secreted mucins.</p></disp-quote><p>As the reviewer suggested before, we now include data showing that the secreted fraction does not contain cytosolic proteins to exclude contribution of cell lysis (Figure 4A).</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>The effect on transcript expression would add a nice complement to these studies deciphering the transcriptional element of mucus production.</p></disp-quote><p>We have included new data (qPCR) on the effect on transcriptional regulation of mucins (Figure 4 – Supplement figure 1B).</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Assessment of mucus secretion upon modulation of the FOLFIRI effect by KChipP3 expression levels or Benzamil and SN-6 treatment would be required to provide a functional link to mucus.</p></disp-quote><p>As the reviewer suggested, we have assessed the mucin secretion after FOLFIRI treatment (Figure 4A).

By 100 months, the two populations look radically different. Either something is wrong with the statistics, or the analysis has a problem.</p></disp-quote><p>The statistical analysis in Figure 2C takes into account the whole curve, and since for the first 100 months both curves are very similar, there are no significant differences. Interestingly, we have found three patients that behave differently from the rest and were responsible for this change after 100 months. We have found that these patients have low levels of MUC5AC but high levels of other secreted mucins, which could explain the fall in DFS (Figure 2 – Supplement figure 1A). We now describe this in the discussion as stated below.</p><p>“There is no significant effect on patients with low MUC5AC expression (Figure 2C), although after 100 months there is a decrease in DFS. Further analysis of this effect revealed that three patients (GSM358532, GSM358534 and GSM358438) were responsible of this effect. We studied these patients in more detail and interestingly, although they have low levels of MUC5AC, these patients present increased levels of other secreted mucins (e.g., MUC2) (Figure 2 – Supplement figure 1A). However, similarly to previous studies (10, 12), analysis of the effect of MUC2 levels on DFS shows that high MUC2 levels are protective while patients with low levels of MUC2, which may reflect a more dedifferentiated state of cancer cells, have a lower DFS (HR=2.54, p=0.023) (Figure 2 – Supplement figure 1B). Importantly, when we studied the effect of KChIP3 on the DFS of patients with high expression of MUC2, we found a clear tendency (p=0.08) to worse prognosis in patients with low levels of KChIP3 (Figure 2 – Supplement figure 1C). Altogether, these results suggest that low levels of KChIP3, which consequently increase the quantity of mucins secreted, protect cancer cells from chemotherapeutic drugs.”</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>5. The description of Figure 3B is confusing. The authors seem to say that the combination treatment is effective, then not effective, then effective again.

We apologize for this confusion; we have rewritten the sentences to make this consistent as stated below.</p><p>“We then tested cell viability of HT29-M6 at 24- and 72-hours post-treatment of 5-FU+iri. alone or in combination with Benzamil. There was no significant effect of the combined Benzamil and 5-FU+iri. treatment at 24 hours. At 72 hours, however, the therapeutic effect of low concentration of 5-FU+iri. (15% reduction on cell viability) was strongly enhanced when combined with 20 µM Benzamil (40% reduction on cell viability compared with the control) (Figure 3B). These results demonstrate that treatment with the NCX inhibitor Benzamil improves the effect of chemotherapy on tumour cell eradication.”</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>6. Figure 4A and 4C seem to be contradictory, because Figure 4A shows no significant increase in (g)H2A.X with SN-6 whereas Figure 4C shows a strong increase. Please clarify.</p></disp-quote><p>In Figure 4A there is some increase in the SN-6 treatment at 1 and 3 hours, which is not so evident at 6 hours likely due to saturation of the signal. Figure 4C is conceptually different as it represents the percent of cells that are positive for (g)H2A.X and not the amount of signal. Despite that, we now include a new Figure 4A with lower amounts of cell lysate, which confirms the increase in yH2A.X.</p><p>[Editors' note: further revisions were suggested prior to acceptance, as described below.]</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>The manuscript has been improved but there are some remaining issues that need to be addressed, as outlined below:</p><p>In light of the comments by Reviewer #1 below, the following revisions are requested:</p><p>1. Given that the model is that 5FU+iri increases mucin secretion, direct demonstration of increased mucin secretion (as opposed to mucin vesicle production) upon 5FU+iri treatment vs. vehicle control should be shown. An experiment similar to what is shown in Figure 1C but with 5FU+iri treatment vs vehicle would address this. Also, westerns of Muc5AC from media and cell lysates of vehicle treated vs. 5FU+iri treated (similar to what is shown in Figure 4A) would allow quantitation of this increase and would strengthen the paper.</p></disp-quote><p>Data demonstrating that 5-FU+iri promotes mucin secretion is already shown in Figure 4A. It is important to state that 5-FU+iri is diluted in tissue culture medium, so the comparison of time 0 vs. the other time points is the experiment that the reviewer is requesting. In more detail, cells are grown to confluency and, seven days post-confluency, they are incubated with 5-FU+iri (and pre-treated with vehicle or mucin secretion inhibitors in Figure 4A) for the corresponding time points (starting for 24 hr treatment and continuing with the subsequent time points). Lysates and extracellular medium are finally collected at the same time. This procedure alleviates any issues that might arise due to time dependent release in export of mucins under baseline or stimulated secretion. We have added the protocol for these experiments in supplementary figure 1 and 4; and changed the labels of Figure 4 (New Figure 4, Figure 1 —figure supplement 1A and Figure 4 —figure supplement 1A). We have also included specific description in the Materials and methods and extended this part in the results.</p><p>“Materials and methods</p><p>Secretion assay and western blot (WB)</p><p>HT29 cells were grown to confluency and, seven days post-confluency, cells were incubated with 5-FU+iri.

Thus, our results revealed that 5-FU+iri treatment caused an increase in mucin secretion (60 – 80% compared to time 0), which was blocked by SN-6 (Relative levels: 1.8 vs 1.0, respectively) (Figure 4A).”</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>2. There is still some confusion over the link between Kchip3 expression, mucin secretion, chemo treatment and CRC patient outcome. The authors presumably already have images showing increased and decreased mucin secretion in the cell lines where kchip3 has been mutated or overexpressed relative to controls-showing these data would greatly strengthen the paper. Additionally, if the authors could include some clarification/discussion that the patient data is based on gene expression rather than mucin secretion, and does not include information on chemotherapy treatment, this may resolve some of the confusion.</p></disp-quote><p>This paper is a research advance to our previous publication “KChIP3 coupled to ca<sup>2+</sup> oscillations exerts a tonic brake on baseline mucin release in the colon”, where we clearly showed that modulation of KChIP3 levels affects mucin secretion.

Mucus secretion was further analyzed using general staining (Alcian blue) of treated cells and organoids. The data on cells is very hard to interpret while the stained organoid shows secreted mucus.

It is important to note that this anti-MUC5AC antibody mainly recognizes the mature mucin granules (close to the plasma membrane, as shown in (7)), which can explain the apparent contradiction with the effect of 5-FU+iri. treatment on mucin production (Figure 1). Besides, it has been previously shown that after maximum stimulated secretion, mucin stores require 24 hours to be fully restored (23).
