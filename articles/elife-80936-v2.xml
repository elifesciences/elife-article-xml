We compared the osteochondral units of the humeral head of marine and terrestrial mammals across species spanning a wide range of body weights, focusing on microstructural organization and biomechanical performance. Aquatic mammals feature cartilage with essentially random collagen fiber configuration, lacking the depth-dependent, arcade-like organization characteristic of terrestrial mammalian species. They have a less stiff articular cartilage at equilibrium with a significantly lower peak modulus, and at the osteochondral interface do not have a calcified cartilage layer, displaying only a thin, highly porous subchondral bone plate. This totally different constitution of the osteochondral unit in aquatic mammals reflects that accommodation of loading is the primordial function of the osteochondral unit. Recognizing the crucial importance of the microarchitecture-function relationship is pivotal for understanding articular biology and, hence, for the development of durable functional regenerative approaches for treatment of joint damage, which are thus far lacking.</p></abstract><kwd-group kwd-group-type="author-keywords"><kwd>dolphin</kwd><kwd>mammals</kwd><kwd>whale</kwd><kwd>cartilage</kwd><kwd>bone</kwd></kwd-group><kwd-group kwd-group-type="research-organism"><title>Research organism</title><kwd>Other</kwd></kwd-group><funding-group><award-group id="fund1"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100000780</institution-id><institution>European Commission</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>3099622 (FP7)</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Mancini</surname><given-names>Irina AD</given-names></name><name><surname>van Weeren</surname><given-names>P René</given-names></name><name><surname>Malda</surname><given-names>Jos</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund2"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100018286</institution-id><institution>Dutch Arthritis Society</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>LLP12</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Levato</surname><given-names>Riccardo</given-names></name><name><surname>Castilho</surname><given-names>Miguel Dias</given-names></name><name><surname>van Weeren</surname><given-names>P René</given-names></name><name><surname>Malda</surname><given-names>Jos</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund3"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100018286</institution-id><institution>Dutch Arthritis Society</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>LLP22</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Levato</surname><given-names>Riccardo</given-names></name><name><surname>Castilho</surname><given-names>Miguel Dias</given-names></name><name><surname>van Weeren</surname><given-names>P René</given-names></name><name><surname>Malda</surname><given-names>Jos</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund4"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution>Dutch Ministry of Nature, Agriculture and Food Quality</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>140000353</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>IJsseldijk</surname><given-names>Lonneke L</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund5"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution>Dutch Ministry of Nature, Agriculture and Food Quality</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>WOT04-009-045</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>IJsseldijk</surname><given-names>Lonneke L</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund6"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution>Dutch Ministry of Nature, Agriculture and Food Quality</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>HD3611/BO11018.02 065</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>IJsseldijk</surname><given-names>Lonneke L</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund7"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution>European Community’s Seventh Framework Programme</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>FP7/2007– 2013 (HydroZONES)</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>van Weeren</surname><given-names>P René</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><funding-statement>The funders had no role in study design, data collection and interpretation, or the decision to submit the work for publication.</funding-statement></funding-group><custom-meta-group><custom-meta specific-use="meta-only"><meta-name>Author impact statement</meta-name><meta-value>Analysis of the osteochondral unit of aquatic mammals reveals a distinctly different tissue structure, lacking the arcade-like collagen fiber organization, a calcified cartilage layer and a dense subchondral bone plate, typically seen in osteochondral tissue of terrestrial mammals.</meta-value></custom-meta></custom-meta-group></article-meta></front><body><sec id="s1" sec-type="intro"><title>Introduction</title><p>In the course of evolution, mammals have gone from land to water at several occasions, resulting in separate lineages ranging from Cetacea, which include whales and dolphins, to diverging lines, such as the polar bear (<italic>Ursus maritimus</italic>) and sea otter (<italic>Enhydra lutris</italic>) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib51">Uhen, 2007</xref>). Polar bears and sea otters have maintained their terrestrial form despite spending a significant portion of their life in water, while other species, in their evolutionary process, have become permanent residents of the aquatic environment, undergoing considerable morphological adaptations to marine life (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib51">Uhen, 2007</xref>). This long adaptation process that started in the Eocene, is particularly evident in Cetacea (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib51">Uhen, 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">Reidenberg, 2007</xref>), where thoracic limbs became flippers, hind limbs regressed and disappeared, and vertebral bones adopted a more uniform morphology (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Cozzi et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib47">Thewissen et al., 2006</xref>).</p><p>The main drive for these changes was obviously meeting the physical demands of life in an aquatic environment, where locomotion is largely disentangled from weight-bearing (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib50">Turnbull and Cowan, 1999</xref>), and thus radically different than as experienced on land. In fact, in water, buoyancy changes the influence of gravity dramatically and water is denser and more viscous than air, influencing resistance (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Dejours, 1987</xref>). Therefore, locomotion in water happens when the mechanism that propels the animal forward is powerful enough to counter the effects of drag. Different mammalian species specialized in the form of diverse morphologies of their body and limbs (or fins), however, always with the common denominator of the development of propulsive surfaces that oscillate to generate thrust. Swimming of aquatic mammals differs significantly in mechanical efficiency and stress distribution from locomotion in terrestrial mammals relying on limb movement. In particular, pinnipeds, cetaceans and sirenians descend from mammals that evolved to move limbs in a vertical plane, and consequently use a hydrodynamic lift-based momentum exchange to move through water (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Farnum, 2007</xref>).</p><p>In all mammals, regardless whether they live on land or in water, locomotion is effectuated by the musculoskeletal system. Its framework is composed by the skeleton, whose bony components articulate via joints. The function of synovial joints in particular, is to ensure the correct articulation of adjacent bones. In addition, it minimizes friction between the bony components by providing a smooth articulating surface and lubrication to accommodate the biomechanical forces generated by locomotion, transmitting and dampening them (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib44">Sophia Fox et al., 2009</xref>). The fundamental element that enables physiological function of the synovial joint is the osteochondral unit, composed of articular cartilage and bone. In the front extremities, synovial joints are the principal joint type in terrestrial mammals; in aquatic mammals they have been preserved during evolution at the articulating ends of the humerus, radius, and ulna (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib41">Sanchez and Berta, 2010</xref>), but have been replaced by fibrous joints in the distal joints of flippers, where bony elements are connected by dense connective tissue (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib48">Thewissen, 2009</xref>).</p><p>Earlier comparative studies on the musculoskeletal system of terrestrial and aquatic mammals have largely focused on bone differences. This is probably because bone is a tissue known to respond extensively and quickly to changes in loading, as described by Wolff’s law and Frost’s mechanostat theory (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib57">Wolff, 1893</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Frost, 2001</xref>). Studies on the macroscopic structures have shown that the bones of the cetacean arm and forearm adopted an hourglass-like form, and that the medullary cavity disappeared to strengthen flipper resistance for steering during swimming (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">de Buffrénil and Schoevaert, 1988</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Felts and Spurrell, 1965</xref>). At tissue level, evolutionary adaptations of the bone have been described for both terrestrial (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Doube et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">Mancini et al., 2019</xref>) and aquatic mammals (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Gray et al., 2007</xref>), with a particular focus on how aquatic mammals manage buoyancy by variations in their structural bone density (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Gray et al., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib46">Taylor, 2000</xref>). However, besides a few studies on some joint diseases (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">Nganvongpanit et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib50">Turnbull and Cowan, 1999</xref>), there is very limited knowledge of specific adaptations of the architecture of the cartilage extracellular matrix in aquatic mammals. Moreover, subchondral bone microstructure and related mechanical characteristics, which provide insight in essential aspects of the functionality of the osteochondral unit in joints, have not yet been studied in detail.</p><p>The osteochondral unit is the pivotal element of the joint, with a fundamental clinical relevance in highly prevalent joint disorders as osteoarthritis (OA), for which no effective, durable treatment exists yet (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Lepage et al., 2019</xref>). In terrestrial mammals, comparative studies on the osteochondral unit have shown that the biochemical components of the tissues are strongly preserved across a wide range of species (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Malda et al., 2013</xref>). A negative allometric relationship exists between cartilage thickness and body mass (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Malda et al., 2013</xref>) and it is the trabecular bone structure that adapts to increasing body mass (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">Mancini et al., 2019</xref>). At present, comparative studies of the osteochondral unit of terrestrial and aquatic mammalian species do not exist, despite the high clinical relevance of the structure and the potential fundamental insights such studies would provide.</p><p>The aim of this study was, therefore, to investigate if and how the structure of both the cartilage and the bone component of the osteochondral unit differs between mammals living on land or in water. Given that the biological function of the osteochondral unit is largely structural in nature and determined by the composition and the architecture of the extracellular matrix (ECM) of both the cartilage and the bone part, the present work focused on analyzing the microstructural composition and architectural features of the osteochondral units from the humeral head of six aquatic and nine terrestrial mammalian species.</p></sec><sec id="s2" sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><sec id="s2-1"><title>Histological and polarized light microscopy analysis of cartilage</title><p>Articular cartilage thickness varied widely between species, ranging from 209 μm in the rat to 7660 μm in the sperm whale (<italic>Physeter macrocephalus</italic>).

Here, the characteristics of articular cartilage of aquatic mammals are described for the first time and they appeared to be widely different from all known terrestrial species in which this has been investigated. In contrast to the arcade-like (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Benninghoff, 1925</xref>) collagen arrangement in the articular cartilage of terrestrial mammals, articular cartilage collagen fibers did not display this alignment in aquatic mammals. Moreover, the cartilage-bone interface of aquatic mammals entirely lacks the typical calcified layer present in all terrestrial species in which the osteochondral unit has been investigated. Further, it also lacks a dense subchondral plate, featuring an abrupt transition from hyaline cartilage to subchondral trabecular bone. Aquatic mammals lack the intermediate transitional forms of either cartilage (the calcified layer) or bone (the subchondral plate) that are typical of terrestrial species. Interestingly, for semi-aquatic species, such as the harbor seal (<italic>Phoca vitulina</italic>), there appears still to be some densification of the subchondral bone region, but this needs further investigation. Nevertheless, the trabeculae of the subchondral bone are thinner in aquatics than in terrestrials and they do not increase in size with increasing body mass, in contrast with what has been observed in terrestrial mammals.</p><p>Previously, it was shown that cartilage biochemistry is remarkably preserved among species, and that cartilage tissue displays microstructural features that allow functionality in mice as much as in elephants (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Malda et al., 2013</xref>). One of the important features in the accommodation of different forces generated by body mass is the thickness of the tissue. Our group previously reported that articular cartilage thickness scaled with negative allometry in relationship to body mass (<italic>a</italic>=0.28), based on the analysis of nearly 60 terrestrial mammalian species (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Malda et al., 2013</xref>). Interestingly, in the analysis presented here, it was observed that this correlation was similar in aquatic mammals, suggesting that this relationship might be dependent of factors other than loading, such as possibly metabolic limitations (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Holliday et al., 2010</xref>). In hyaline cartilage, an avascular tissue in which nutrient supply is dependent on diffusion and fluid flow across a poroviscoelastic matrix (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Lu and Mow, 2008</xref>), metabolite limitation is known to be related to tissue thickness (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Malda et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib53">White and Seymour, 2003</xref>). In the sperm whale, an almost direct transition from hyaline cartilage to trabecular subchondral bone was observed, making diffusion from the rich vascular network of the trabecular bone to the hyaline cartilage probably as easy as diffusion from the synovial fluid at the articular surface of that hyaline cartilage. The increased porosity, and thus the greater potential for transfer of solutes, may permit the great cartilage thickness seen in some aquatic mammals (over 7 mm in the largest whale [<italic>Balaenoptera physalus</italic>]). As an avascular tissue, cartilage is dependent on diffusion, so critical thickness will be larger if diffusion of nutrients can be provided more efficiently from two sides. The ratio of nutrient exchange is likely to be different in aquatic mammals, as at the few sites where the hyaline cartilage is in direct contact with the subchondral bone in terrestrial animals, solute exchange has been shown to be fivefold higher than through the calcified cartilage (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Arkill and Winlove, 2008</xref>).</p><p>Simon et al. did not observe a consistent correlation between cartilage thickness and estimated compressive stress on the joint in a study conducted on five species of terrestrial mammals that varied widely in body mass (mouse, rat, dog, sheep, and cow; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib43">Simon, 1970</xref>). When studying the thicknesses of the different zones that make up articular cartilage, significant differences were observed between aquatic and terrestrial mammals in the deep and middle layers. However, this was not the case for the superficial layer. This supports the notion that the primary role of the superficial layer of cartilage is to protect the deeper layers from shear forces and to distribute impact forces and loads among the tissue (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Julkunen et al., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Bevill et al., 2010</xref>). Importantly, the load distribution of forces is essential in both aquatic and terrestrial species. Unlike shear forces, compressive loads will, however, be substantially lower in aquatic species, which would be a likely explanation for the relatively thinner deep layer.</p><p>A significant difference in the predominance of fiber orientation was found between aquatic and terrestrial mammals in all cartilage layers: collagen fiber orientation in terrestrial species followed the classic Benninghoff arcade model (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Benninghoff, 1925</xref>). This is known to be conserved in all terrestrial species in which the configuration has been investigated (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Kääb et al., 1998</xref>) and in which orientation is principally parallel to the surface in the superficial layer, and is changing in the middle zone as the fibers are bending towards an orientation perpendicular to the subchondral bone in the deep layer. The deep layer is known to increase in relative thickness with increasing body mass and therefore increasing compressive loading (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Felts and Spurrell, 1965</xref>). Conversely, in aquatic mammals, orientation of the collagen fibers throughout the whole thickness of the cartilage was more random. In an aquatic mammal, the total biomechanical loading of the joints will be less because of the absence of gravity and in a relative sense, shear forces, which perhaps are less than in case of terrestrial locomotion, but are still generated by swimming (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Dejours, 1987</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib56">Williams and Worthy, 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib54">Williams, 1999</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib55">Williams, 2001</xref>), will become more important. This could potentially explain the presence of only a thin superficial layer. Moreover, it is likely that the heterogeneity in the alignment of the collagen fibers in aquatic mammals represents the strongly reduced need for a specifically organized orientation as seen in terrestrial mammals.</p><p>The different collagen fiber orientation observed in the aquatic mammals compared to terrestrial mammals is also reflected in the biomechanical behavior of cartilage. To analyze this effect, both peak and equilibrium modulus of cartilage were determined. These parameters are commonly used to describe the mechanical functionality of native and engineered cartilage because they provide a better understanding of how the constituents of cartilage contribute to its overall mechanical function (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">Mow et al., 1984</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Klika et al., 2016</xref>). The mechanical responses observed in the aquatic mammals are indicative of an overall less stiff cartilage tissue, compared to that in terrestrial mammals. Furthermore, the absence of a defined collagen network structure in the aquatic mammals is likely to provide less resistance to osmotic swelling, as in terrestrial mammal’s cartilage up to two thirds of the elastic modulus in compression arises from the electrostatic contributions and osmotic swelling that is restricted inside the organized collagen matrix (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Lai et al., 1991</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Canal Guterl et al., 2010</xref>).</p><p>The lack of a calcified cartilage layer and a compact subchondral plate, which are typical features of the osteochondral unit in terrestrial animals (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib44">Sophia Fox et al., 2009</xref>), was highly remarkable. The main function of the calcified layer in the osteochondral unit is to provide a gradual transition in stiffness from hyaline cartilage to subchondral bone and to serve as anchor point for the collagen fibers in the deep layer of the hyaline cartilage, that is to serve as a foundation for the Benninghoff arcades (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib44">Sophia Fox et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Benninghoff, 1925</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Madry et al., 2010</xref>). The subchondral plate has a role in distributing the compressive forces acting on the joint. As discussed earlier, in aquatic mammals compressive loading is hardly present and it may well be that firm anchoring of the collagen fibrils is much less important for this reason. Detailed studies using high resolution electron microscopy might shed some light on this issue.</p><p>Bone density deeper under the cartilage tissue (trabecular BV/TV) was relatively higher in terrestrial mammals and increased with body mass, while the opposite was observed in aquatic mammals. For the terrestrial animals the relationship, this is in accordance with the earlier observation in these animals trabecular bone increases with increasing in size (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Barak et al., 2013</xref>). The second observation, can be attributed to the lack of loading and the fact that in aquatic mammals living in deep waters, in which the absence of gravity obviates the need for such adaptation to increasing body mass, it has been shown that low bone density enables dynamic buoyancy control (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Gray et al., 2007</xref>), explaining the opposite tendency in terrestrials. According to Dumont et al., bone microanatomy carries an ecological signal that holds information about habitat and locomotion patterns, which is particularly evident in tetrapods that have developed advanced secondary adaptations to life in water (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Dumont et al., 2013</xref>). In the matter of buoyancy control of aquatic mammals, species recently adapted to aquatic life or living in shallow waters, such as sea cows (sirenians), have bones that are denser than in terrestrial forms to allow static control (<italic>ballast</italic>), as opposed to a lower bone density typically associated with the dynamic buoyancy control required by animals that exhibit deep diving behavior for longer periods (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Gray et al., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib52">Wall, 1983</xref>).</p><p>Moreover, bone trabecular thickness behaved in a similar manner. This parameter also increased with size in terrestrial mammals, with a trend similar to previous reports in literature (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">Mancini et al., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Doube et al., 2011</xref>), while in aquatic mammals trabecular thickness appeared to scale independently. This independence can possibly be explained by the lack of compressive forces necessary to elicit a proportionate response in the bone for trabecular thickness as suggested by Wolff’s law (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib57">Wolff, 1893</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Frost, 2001</xref>). In fact, Rolvien et al. investigated characteristics of the vertebral bodies of three toothed whale species sperm whale<italic>,</italic> orca (<italic>Orcinus orca</italic>) and harbor porpoise (<italic>Phocoena phocoena</italic>) and found that bone volume fraction (BV/TV) did not scale with body mass, but that trabeculae were thicker and fewer in number in larger whale species (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib40">Rolvien et al., 2017</xref>). Although research has shown the relationship between bone microanatomical organization, habitats and locomotion patterns in different taxa (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Dumont et al., 2013</xref>), this was less clear when comparing different species of whales, particularly in view of the variability of for example diving-depth behavior of the different animals (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib40">Rolvien et al., 2017</xref>).</p><p>Interestingly, the histological sections of the aquatic mammals, displayed small islands of cartilaginous tissue embedded within the subchondral bone, and in the larger aquatic species, such as the sperm whale, large islands of cartilage tissue were found deep in the trabecular bone. These appeared as large lacunae upon first inspection with micro-CT, and an initial explanation was that these were a possible areas of osteocyte death due to barotraumas, which have been anecdotally described in deep-diving mammals (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">Moore and Early, 2004</xref>). However, upon histological evaluation, these islands appeared to be composed of healthy cartilage-like tissue naturally embedded in the bone, devoid of evident signs of bone remodeling, not suggesting any form of pathology. The areas may, therefore, represent incomplete osteochondral ossification, well-known in the horse and other species as osteochondrosis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib49">Thomas and Barnes, 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">McCoy et al., 2013</xref>) similarly to what was found and described by Rolvien et al. in the central areas of the vertebrae of sperm whales (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib40">Rolvien et al., 2017</xref>).</p><p>The number of individuals and species from which samples could be obtained was based on species availability and practical (such as the possibility of tissue harvest shortly after death from aquatic mammals) and does not compare to the numbers of earlier multispecies investigations in terrestrial animals (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">Mancini et al., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Malda et al., 2013</xref>), which could be considered as a major limitation of this study. However, the included aquatic species covered a wide range of body masses (from 54 to 48,000 kg) and can, given the high consistency of the findings and the clear and unambiguous landslide differences with terrestrial species, be considered representative, especially in view of the very limited and subtle differences observed between a large number of different terrestrial species in the earlier studies (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">Mancini et al., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Malda et al., 2013</xref>). Taken together, the findings of the current study add significantly to our knowledge of the basic aspects of the biology of the osteochondral unit and clearly reflect the crucial influence of loading. We know from evolution that life started to develop in the water and that later species came on land to develop further (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Colbert and Morales, 2001</xref>). We also know that all mammals have initially evolved on land and that some of them returned to the water to become what we now call aquatic mammals (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Colbert and Morales, 2001</xref>). Where we do not have histological data from the joints of the land-borne species from which our current aquatic mammalian species have evolved, it is reasonable to assume that their osteochondral units were similar to the common format of all currently existing terrestrial mammalian species. The huge structural differences between the osteochondral units of the currently living aquatic and terrestrial mammals make hence clear that accommodating loading is the most important evolutionary pressure on the osteochondral unit of terrestrial mammals. Further, it highlights that this challenge is dealt with by the architecture and structural composition of the osteochondral unit and not by molecular composition or cellular diversity. The last two elements of the osteochondral unit are similar in aquatics and terrestrials. It is the specific tissue architecture and structural organization of especially the cartilage-bone interface that got lost in aquatic mammals, once the loading-based evolutionary pressure disappeared. This increased insight in the fundamental biology of the structural components of the osteochondral unit, obtained by observing Nature, is of great importance from a tissue repair perspective, as it is a natural guide for which considerations should be prioritized in the quest for recapitulation of the native template for regenerative purposes. In this sense, the study presents strong support for a recent call to rethink the current paradigms in articular cartilage regeneration (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">Malda et al., 2019</xref>), through focusing on solutions with a proper architecture that allow restoration of (biomechanical) function, rather than on mere cellular activity in terms of production of extracellular matrix components.</p></sec><sec id="s4" sec-type="methods"><title>Methods</title><sec id="s4-1"><title>Collection of materials and tissues</title><p>To investigate the morphology of cartilage tissue and of the interface between cartilage and bone, histological analysis was performed on osteochondral samples taken from fresh humeral heads (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6</xref>) of a variety of terrestrial and aquatic mammals (<xref ref-type="table" rid="table1">Table 1</xref>).

Histological sections were stained with picrosirius red to stain the collagen fibers of the cartilage extracellular matrix (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Junqueira et al., 1979</xref>). All microscopic images were acquired through an Olympus DP73 digital camera using Cell^F software (Matrix Optics, Malaysia). A combination of U-ANT and U-POT filters mounted on a light microscope (Olympus BX51, Olympus) was used for the PLM measurements. The two cross polarizers were used so that highly ordered collagen fibers that were perpendicular or tangential to the articular surface appeared bright or red, while fibers with other orientations (non-birefringent) appeared darkest. Collagen fiber orientation visualized via PLM was used for the classification of the superficial, middle and deep layer of cartilage (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Changoor et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">Rieppo et al., 2008</xref>). The area with the minimum birefringence value was identified as the border between the superficial and the middle zones, whereas the deep zone was considered to begin when the orientation angle values reached a plateau (typically close to 90 degrees with respect to cartilage surface) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Julkunen et al., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Arokoski et al., 1996</xref>). Micrographs acquired via PLM were converted to 8-bit images and the angle of orientation of the collagen structures was calculated within each of the three zones via automated image analysis and Fourier spectrum analysis, using the Directionality plug-in from the FIJI software (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib42">Schindelin et al., 2012</xref>). Data were plotted as histograms of frequency for each representative angle, and as radial plots (0° represent fibers parallel to the articulating surface) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7</xref>). For each of the histograms, the peaks centered at 0° and ±90° and were integrated to calculate their area using the OriginPro 8 software package (OriginLab, USA).

Stress relaxation tests were performed by first applying a pre-load of 0.01 N to test samples and then strained to 15% at a rate of 10 µm/s, followed by a relaxation period of 900 s. Tests were conducted on cylindrical osteochondral plugs (<xref ref-type="table" rid="table2">Table 2</xref>).

Here, stress is defined as the force divided by the specimen’s unloaded cross-sectional area, and strain as the ratio between the original sample thickness and the displacement of compression platen. To quantify the relaxation response, a piecewise exponential function was fitted to the obtained stress-time curves, following the method by <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Castilho et al., 2019</xref>.

However, the data presented in Figure 4A showed that aquatic animals seem to have a tide mark. The authors need to explain this discrepancy.</p><p><italic>Reviewer #1 (Recommendations for the authors):</italic></p><p>Within this comparative study of terrestrial and aquatic mammals using morphological and biomechanical methods, the authors could point out differences that most probably relate to their movement under buoyancy versus full gravity. Most importantly aquatic animals have a less stiff cartilage (at equilibrium), a more random alignment of collagen, and a lack of calcified cartilage leading to a continuous transition between cartilage and bone. Uniaxial compression tests, polarization microscopy, histochemistry, and µCT provided the necessary information about stress relaxation, fiber orientation, and cartilage versus bone localization. Despite the limited number of species presented in more detail, the results were sound and conclusive and elucidated new aspects of cartilage extension into the subchondral space which is interesting for developmental biology as well as tissue regeneration.</p><p>Manuscript in general</p><p>The manuscript is well structured and written and data are presented thoroughly. The methods used are appropriate to answer the research questions and histological, polarization microscopic, and µCD images are of high quality.</p><p>Despite the high number of species included in the study, only three species were presented in more detail.

In Figure 2. A-C the aquatic animals show green polarization in the deep zone and red polarization in the main part while in the giraffe the main lower part appeared yellow. Is this conformable with other aquatic and terrestrial species?</p><p>Important point: Furthermore, in Figure 2A the main part of the fibers appears oriented parallel to the joint surface and not without any predominant orientation as described in the text. Please comment on that or change the text accordingly.</p><p>Figure 2 D, E Are the orientation and average peak areas for the three species in Figure A-C or for all species included in this study?</p><p>Figure 2 D: Please explain the x-axis in the polar graphical representation.</p><p>Figure 2 E: Box plot might again be more informative.</p><p>Figure 3A: Is it possible to show also the curves from the other species that were measured?</p><p>3E, F: please declare which data point belongs to which species.</p><p>Important point: Figure 4 Figure legend 4C says that terrestrial mammals display a tide mark. Does this formulation seem to implicate that aquatic animals do not have a tide mark? However, in the insert of Figure 4A, a line is visible which also looks like a tide mark. Can you please comment on that?</p><p>Figure 4D: The legend says that the figure shows on top a dense surface area that interfaces with the (calcified) cartilage (not shown in the scan). How is this meant? Was the calcified cartilage removed?</p><p>Discussion:</p><p>&quot;articular cartilage collagen fibers did not display a preferential alignment in aquatic mammals.&quot; Figure 2A appears as if the main part (middle layer) was aligned horizontally (parallel to the surface).</p><p>&quot;…This supports the notion that the primary role of the superficial layer of cartilage is to distribute impact forces and loads among the tissue&quot; In addition, the superficial zone (thickness and structure) is a consequence of the shear force which influences the tissue mainly to a restricted depth. This might also be a predominant reason for the low thickness of the superficial zone.</p><p>&quot;A significant difference in the predominance of fiber orientation was found between aquatic and terrestrial mammals in all cartilage layers&quot; – except in the superficial zone?</p><p>&quot;In the matter of buoyancy control of aquatic mammals, species recently adapted to aquatic life or living in shallow waters …&quot; maybe add an example of such a species.</p><p>Important point: For the mechanical test osteochondral cylinders were used. Could the authors please explain in more detail about the standardization and the proportion of bone and cartilage (e.g. total thickness of the plugs always the same)? In case the bone was of different thicknesses, how do the authors think that it could influence the values of the measurements and therefore the interpretation of the data?</p><p>The large islands of cartilage tissue within the trabecular bone are very interesting. Do the authors have any explanation for that? Could it be residuals of endochondral ossification or be related to an increased cross-talk between cartilage and bone due to a more continuous transition and less complete separation of bone and cartilage?</p><p>Materials and methods:</p><p>Were micro CT samples subsequently used for histology?</p><p>For completeness please mention the program that was used for statistics.</p></body></sub-article><sub-article article-type="reply" id="sa2"><front-stub><article-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.80936.sa2</article-id><title-group><article-title>Author response</article-title></title-group></front-stub><body><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Essential revisions:</p><p>1) An additional figure plate showing a selection of further species, especially the high extremes would further increase the value of the manuscript.</p></disp-quote><p>This has now been included as Figure 4—figure supplement 1.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>2) Making schematic drawings that indicate the location of the humerus joint for the three most presented species will help readers understand the anatomical and biomechanical context.</p></disp-quote><p>This has now been included as Figure 6.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>3) In the legend of Figure 4, the authors stated that terrestrial mammals display a tide mark, implying that aquatic animals do not have a tide mark.

Is this conformable with other aquatic and terrestrial species?</p></disp-quote><p>The reviewer brings up an important point. It is known that in terrestrial mammals the collagen fiber thickness varies and increases with dept (see for example, Changoor <italic>et al.</italic> OAC 19:1458, 2011). However, visualization of picro Sirius red-stained samples cannot be directly related to the fiber thickness alone as the packing of the collagen molecules is an additional determining factor (Dayan <italic>et al.</italic> Histochem 93:27, 1989), which is of particular relevance in the densely packed cartilage tissue. Therefore, we have not commented on this in the revised manuscript.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Important point: Furthermore, in Figure 2A the main part of the fibers appears oriented parallel to the joint surface and not without any predominant orientation as described in the text. Please comment on that or change the text accordingly.</p></disp-quote><p>The reviewer raises an important point indeed. The statement in the manuscript text was quite strong. There is a clear distinction between the fiber orientation in the aquatic and terrestrial samples, however minor alignment can indeed be observed. We have adjusted it now to better reflect our observations. The text now reads:</p><p>“…whereas for the aquatic mammals this arcade orientation of fibers could not be distinguished (Figure 2D-E). However, some alignment in the superficial layer was also observed (Figure 2B), albeit not to the same extend as in the samples of terrestrial mammals” (page 6)</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Figure 2 D, E Are the orientation and average peak areas for the three species in Figure A-C or for all species included in this study?</p></disp-quote><p>Indeed, the provided orientation and average peak areas reported are based on all samples (species) included in the study.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Figure 2 D: Please explain the x-axis in the polar graphical representation.</p></disp-quote><p>The information in the radial in the graph is the normalized frequency (how many features the software recognizes) per angle (in degrees), see also Figure 6 in the manuscript for further explanation.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Figure 2 E: Box plot might again be more informative.</p></disp-quote><p>We do thank the reviewer for this suggestion and have changed Figure 2E accordingly.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Figure 3A: Is it possible to show also the curves from the other species that were measured?</p><p>3E, F: please declare which data point belongs to which species.</p></disp-quote><p>Inclusion of the additional curves did not improve the legibility of the graph and as the figure was only intended as an example we have not further altered the original figure.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Important point: Figure 4 Figure legend 4C says that terrestrial mammals display a tide mark. Does this formulation seem to implicate that aquatic animals do not have a tide mark? However, in the insert of Figure 4A, a line is visible which also looks like a tide mark. Can you please comment on that?</p></disp-quote><p>We thank the reviewer for pointing this out. The observed line, or dark border, on the image in Figure 4A is actually not the tidemark, but an artifact (wrinkle) in the slide as the large cartilage-bone samples are challenging to process due to the swelling behavior of the cartilage matrix. To support our claim and clarify this, we have included high magnification images of the bone cartilage interface of all three sperm whale samples included in this study as an additional supplementary figure (Figure 4—figure supplement 2).</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Figure 4D: The legend says that the figure shows on top a dense surface area that interfaces with the (calcified) cartilage (not shown in the scan). How is this meant? Was the calcified cartilage removed?</p></disp-quote><p>We apologize for this unclarity. We meant that the cartilage layer is not visualized in the scan (though it was still present during the analysis). We have removed “(calcified)” from the legend text to make this more clear.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Discussion:</p><p>&quot;articular cartilage collagen fibers did not display a preferential alignment in aquatic mammals.&quot; Figure 2A appears as if the main part (middle layer) was aligned horizontally (parallel to the surface).</p></disp-quote><p>We agree with the reviewer that the statement is confusing and have adjusted it in the revised manuscript accordingly. It now reads:</p><p>“In contrast to the arcade-like (Benninghoff<sup>23</sup>) collagen arrangement in the articular cartilage of terrestrial mammals, articular cartilage collagen fibers did not display this alignment in aquatic mammals..”(page 7)</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>&quot;…This supports the notion that the primary role of the superficial layer of cartilage is to distribute impact forces and loads among the tissue&quot; In addition, the superficial zone (thickness and structure) is a consequence of the shear force which influences the tissue mainly to a restricted depth.

Importantly, the load distribution of forces is essential in both aquatic and terrestrial species. Unlike shear forces, compressive loads will, however, be substantially lower in aquatic species, which would be a likely explanation for the relatively thinner deep layer.” (page 9)</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>&quot;A significant difference in the predominance of fiber orientation was found between aquatic and terrestrial mammals in all cartilage layers&quot; – except in the superficial zone?</p></disp-quote><p>A significant different in predominance of fiber orientation was found for all layers, including the superficial zone as is underscored in the lower intensity in the Figures 2A and 2B, as well as the lower frequency reported in Figure 2D for the aquatic samples. However, a thin superficial layer was present. We have now changed the discussion to better reflect this.</p><p>“Conversely, in aquatic mammals, orientation of the collagen fibers throughout the whole thickness of the cartilage was more random. In an aquatic mammal, the total biomechanical loading of the joints will be less because of the absence of gravity and in a relative sense, shear forces, which perhaps are less than in case of terrestrial locomotion, but are still generated by swimming<sup>6,32-34</sup>, will become more important. This could potentially explain the presence of only a thin superficial layer.”</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>&quot;In the matter of buoyancy control of aquatic mammals, species recently adapted to aquatic life or living in shallow waters …&quot; maybe add an example of such a species.</p></disp-quote><p>We thank the reviewer for the suggestion and have now included an example of such an aquatic mammal that lives in shallow water (sea cow).</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Important point: For the mechanical test osteochondral cylinders were used. Could the authors please explain in more detail about the standardization and the proportion of bone and cartilage (e.g. total thickness of the plugs always the same)? In case the bone was of different thicknesses, how do the authors think that it could influence the values of the measurements and therefore the interpretation of the data?</p></disp-quote><p>The overall stiffness of the bone is about three orders of magnitude higher than that of the cartilage. In view of this, we have assumed minimal effects of the bone component on the outcome of the testing.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>The large islands of cartilage tissue within the trabecular bone are very interesting. Do the authors have any explanation for that? Could it be residuals of endochondral ossification or be related to an increased cross-talk between cartilage and bone due to a more continuous transition and less complete separation of bone and cartilage?</p></disp-quote><p>We do thank the reviewer for raising this point. Indeed, this could be remnants of the process of osteochondral ossification. One could actually postulate that due to the limited direct loading the developmental process does not need or is not induced to proceed further and hence does not result in a dense subchondral bone plate. In our clinical experience, we have seen these remnants in (young) horses as well. In those animals these islands may end up as necrotic cartilage (as the original vasculature of the growth cartilage disappears) that in the end may give rise to the formation of fissures and joint mice (loose fragments; osteochondrosis). However, for the aquatics, one can presume that, if the cartilage islands are not too large and are located in quite open and hence very richly vascularized trabecular bone <italic>and are not loaded</italic>, they might survive through diffusion of tissue fluid. However, this would need further investigation.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Materials and methods:</p><p>Were micro CT samples subsequently used for histology?</p></disp-quote><p>No, separate samples were obtained for micro CT and for histology.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>For completeness please mention the program that was used for statistics.</p></disp-quote><p>We apologize for omitting to include this and have now added this to the revised manuscript:</p><p>“Statistical analysis was performed using GraphPad Prism 8 (GraphPad Software, Dotmatics, USA).” (page 17)</p></body></sub-article></article>
