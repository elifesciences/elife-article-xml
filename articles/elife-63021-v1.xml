(ID)-causing gene mutations remain largely unclear, although many genetic variations might relate to ID. We screened gene mutations in Chinese Han children suffering from severe ID and found a single-nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) in the 5′-untranslated region (5′-UTR) of fibroblast growth factor 13 (FGF13) mRNA (NM_001139500.1:c.-32c&gt;G) shared by three male children. In both HEK293 cells and patient-derived induced pluripotent stem cells, this SNP reduced the translation of FGF13, which stabilizes microtubules in developing neurons. Mice carrying the homologous point mutation in 5′-UTR of <italic>Fgf13</italic> showed delayed neuronal migration during cortical development, and weakened learning and memory. Furthermore, this SNP reduced the interaction between <italic>FGF13</italic> 5′-UTR and polypyrimidine-tract-binding protein 2 (PTBP2), which was required for <italic>FGF13</italic> translation in cortical neurons. Thus, this 5′-UTR SNP of <italic>FGF13</italic> interferes with the translational process of <italic>FGF13</italic> and causes deficits in brain development and cognitive functions.</p></abstract><kwd-group kwd-group-type="author-keywords"><kwd>Intellectual disability</kwd><kwd>fibroblast growth factor 13</kwd><kwd>single-nucleotide polymorphism</kwd><kwd>5'-untranslated region</kwd><kwd>protein translation</kwd><kwd>polypyrimidine-tract-binding protein 2</kwd></kwd-group><kwd-group kwd-group-type="research-organism"><title>Research organism</title><kwd>Human</kwd><kwd>Mouse</kwd></kwd-group><funding-group><award-group id="fund1"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100001809</institution-id><institution>National Natural Science Foundation of China</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>31630033</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Zhang</surname><given-names>Xu</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund2"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100001809</institution-id><institution>National Natural Science Foundation of China</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>31991194</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Bao</surname><given-names>Lan</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund3"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100003399</institution-id><institution>Science and Technology Commission of Shanghai Municipality</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>18JC1420301</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Zhang</surname><given-names>Xu</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund4"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100002367</institution-id><institution>Chinese Academy of Sciences</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>XDPB1005</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Zhang</surname><given-names>Xu</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund5"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100002367</institution-id><institution>Chinese Academy of Sciences</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>XDB39000000</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Zhang</surname><given-names>Xu</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund6"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100002367</institution-id><institution>Chinese Academy of Sciences</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>QYZDY-SSW-SMC007</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Zhang</surname><given-names>Xu</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><funding-statement>The funders had no role in study design, data collection and interpretation, or the decision to submit the work for publication.</funding-statement></funding-group><custom-meta-group><custom-meta specific-use="meta-only"><meta-name>Author impact statement</meta-name><meta-value>A 5'-UTR SNP of <italic>FGF13</italic> impairs PTBP2 interacting with FGF13 mRNA, leading to reduced <italic>FGF13</italic> translation and deficits in brain development and cognitive functions.</meta-value></custom-meta></custom-meta-group></article-meta></front><body><sec id="s1" sec-type="intro"><title>Introduction</title><p>Intellectual disability (ID) is defined as an overall intelligence quotient (IQ) of less than 70, together with a disability characterized by ‘significant limitations both in intellectual functioning and in adaptive behavior as expressed in conceptual, social and practical skills’ with onset before the age of 18 years (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Dsm, 1994</xref>). It is estimated that 1–3% of the general population suffers from ID, which is caused by either genetic or environmental factors during development (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib42">Larson et al., 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib58">Ropers, 2008</xref>). About 5–10% of male ID patients are caused by genetic variations in X chromosome, including structure variations (SVs), copy number variations (CNVs), and single-nucleotide variations (SNVs) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib46">Lubs et al., 2012</xref>), and named as X-linked intellectual disability (XLID) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib43">Lehrke, 1972</xref>). Large-scale and systematic sequencing for ID individuals and related families has markedly accelerated the study of the intact genetic spectrum for XLID, and about 200 candidate genes have been suggested for XLID (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Gécz et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib71">Stevenson and Schwartz, 2009</xref>). The sequencing of coding exons of 718 X-chromosome genes from 208 families with ID patients further identifies 9 novel XLID-related genes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib75">Tarpey et al., 2009</xref>), and yet only covers 65% regions of these X-chromosome genes but does not include noncoding sequences. Whether the ID-related genetic variations cause ID pathogenesis needs to be proved with cell models and animal models. In addition, huge difference of genetic background exists between East Asian (EAS) and European (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib68">Sirugo et al., 2019</xref>), while populations in the Europe and the USA have magnificent databases of human genomics. Therefore, the investigation of genetic mutations in the genetic spectrum of Chinese population is of significance.</p><p>The proper translation of mRNAs is critical for cellular functions, and neurons particularly rely on the accurately controlled mRNA translation both spatially and temporally. Defects in the translational control have been linked to numerous neurodegenerative disorders (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Darnell and Klann, 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Gkogkas et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Buffington et al., 2014</xref>). The 5′-untranslated region (5′-UTR) of mRNA is the frame for 43S subunit to scan along at the initiation of translation, and features within the 5′-UTR could modulate the efficiency of mRNA translation, including 5′-UTR length, secondary structures, multiple upstream open reading frames (uORFs), and internal ribosome entry site (IRES) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Chatterjee and Pal, 2009</xref>). Moreover, various elements located in the UTRs of mRNAs influence the translation and may cause diseases under altered conditions (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib40">Kondo et al., 1998</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib76">Tassone et al., 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib63">Scheper et al., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib79">Wang et al., 2007</xref>). For example, the fragile X syndrome (FXS) is the most frequent form of inherited XLID caused by an expansion of the CGG triplet repeat on X chromosome within the 5′-UTR of <italic>FMR1</italic>, which leads to the excessive methylation and silenced <italic>FMR1</italic> transcription (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Bell et al., 1991</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib52">Oberlé et al., 1991</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib77">Verkerk et al., 1991</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib89">Yu et al., 1991</xref>). The current studies are biased to identify coding variants implicated in ID (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Gilissen et al., 2014</xref>), while the pathogenic non-coding regulatory variants, including duplication, insertion, and SNVs, have only been discovered in a few cases to date (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Borck et al., 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Bonnet et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">Huang et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib41">Kumar et al., 2016</xref>). Nevertheless, the deleterious functions and underlying mechanisms of those noncoding variants remain to be further explored.</p><p>The regulation of cytoskeleton dynamics is important for neuronal morphogenesis, and several microtubule-stabilizing proteins (MSPs), such as doublecortin identified from human lissencephaly patients (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Gleeson et al., 1998</xref>), are involved in the process of axon branching (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">Kappeler et al., 2006</xref>) and neuronal migration (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Gleeson et al., 1999</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">Koizumi et al., 2006</xref>). Fibroblast growth factor 13 (FGF13), a nonsecretory fibroblast growth factor (FGF), belongs to the <italic>FGF11</italic> subfamily (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Goldfarb, 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib91">Zhang et al., 2012</xref>). <italic>FGF13</italic> might be a candidate gene for the syndromal and nonspecific forms of XLID mapped to the q26 region of X-chromosome (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib69">Smallwood et al., 1996</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Gecz et al., 1999</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Goldfarb, 2005</xref>). In a Börjeson–Forssman–Lehmann syndrome-like patient, <italic>FGF13</italic> was interrupted by a duplication breakpoint (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Gecz et al., 1999</xref>). Moreover, FGF13b, the cytoplasmic isoform of FGF13, serves as a MSP required for axon development, neuronal migration, and brain development, and FGF13-deficient mice exhibit impaired learning and memory (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib86">Wu et al., 2012</xref>). Genetic disruption of <italic>FGF13</italic> due to chromosome translocation in a genetic epilepsy family is also associated with cognitive impairment, in which not only the proband but also his mother’s maternal aunt together with her two children all exhibit cognitive impairments (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib55">Puranam et al., 2015</xref>). However, the function and the regulating mechanisms of <italic>FGF13</italic> mutations in ID still lack systematic investigations.</p><p>Here, we identified a single-nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) in the 5′-UTR of <italic>FGF13</italic> of 3 severe ID children (IQ &lt; 40). This 5′-UTR mutation selectively hampered the protein translation of FGF13. The defects of neuronal migration and axon branching along with ID-related behaviors appeared in mice carrying the homologous point mutation of FGF13. This point mutation impaired the binding of <italic>FGF13</italic> 5′-UTR with polypyrimidine tract-binding protein (PTBP)1/2, which resulted in the translation dysfunction of <italic>FGF13</italic>.

Among them, three male cases (allele frequency = 2.2%) shared an identical cytosine-to-guanine substitution (C&gt;G) in the 5′-UTR of <italic>FGF13</italic> (NC_000023.10:g.138286301g&gt;C, NM_001139500.1:c.-32c&gt;G) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1A</xref>). The SNP identified in the present study was not reported in previous SNP database at that time (dbSNP, 1000G), but the new build of 1000G database in 2015 (rs757803941) included this site, where the SNP was found in one heterozygous individual from Chinese Han South population (CHS). Meanwhile, the EAS population of ExAC database also reported this SNP in 2016 and showed that it is an EAS-specific SNP (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Exome Aggregation Consortium et al., 2016</xref>).

As expected, in each of these three families, the SNP of <italic>FGF13</italic> is inherited from the mother, which is in accordance with the presumed mode of X-linked recessive inheritance (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1B</xref>). After annotated by the clinVar database (see Materials and methods), the SNPs located in the ID-related genes were predicted to be pathogenic or not (see <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="supp2">Supplementary file 2</xref>). Notably, the father of family 1 had one SNP suggested as pathogenic, and the mother of this family also had one pathogenic SNP. However, their son did not inherit these two pathogenic SNPs from parents and did not have other pathogenic ID-related SNPs. None of the pathogenic ID-related SNPs were found in other two families. The members of all three families did not carry any pathogenic ID-related In-Dels (see <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="supp2">Supplementary file 2</xref>).</p><p>Furthermore, to search for the genomic characteristics of these three children, we performed whole-genome sequencing.

To verify the expression pattern of FGF13 in human brain development, we first reanalyzed the published single-cell database of human fetal prefrontal cortex (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib96">Zhong et al., 2018</xref>) and found that FGF13 mRNA was abundant in both neural progenitor cells (NPCs) and neurons (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1A</xref>). Then, the real-time PCR showed that in human fetal brain the transcript variants 2 and 4 (NM_001139500.1 and NM_001139498.1) that might be influenced by the <italic>FGF13</italic> SNP were highly expressed and more enriched compared to others (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1B</xref>).</p><p>To test the role of the <italic>FGF13</italic> 5′-UTR variation, we constructed pcDNA3.1 plasmids expressing the transcript variant 2 or 4 of <italic>FGF13</italic>, along with the whole 5′-UTR of human sequence origins to be inserted before the coding sequence, which were able to be translated into the isoform 2 or 4 of FGF13, respectively (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1D</xref>). A HA tag-fused RFP (HA-RFP) was also co-expressed in the pcDNA3.1 plasmid to normalize the expression level due to different transfection efficacy. Importantly, immunoblotting showed that the protein levels, but not the mRNA levels, of both isoforms 2 and 4 of FGF13 were reduced in HEK293 cells expressing the plasmids carrying the single-nucleotide mutation of <italic>FGF13</italic> compared to that of wildtype (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1D, E</xref>).

Besides the bands of FGF13 isoforms 2 and 4, other FGF13 bands, which might represent FGF13 isoform 3 or FGF13 isoforms with post-translational modifications, were also verified by the antibody absorption experiment. The intensity of these FGF13-immunoreactive bands exhibited similar reduction in the patient-derived iPSCs. Thus, the protein level of endogenous FGF13 is decreased in patient-derived iPSCs.</p><p>In order to confirm the specific effect of this 5′-UTR point mutation in FGF13 and exclude the variation in FGF13 expression due to individual genetic background, we used the CRISPR/Cas9 system to introduce the mutant nucleotide (C&gt;G) into human iPSCs (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1D</xref>).

RIP experiments detected that the exogenous MS2-FGF13 mRNA exhibited an increased binding to MCP-PTBP2 in HEK293 cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6D</xref>). At the same time, MCP-PTBP2 increased the protein level of FGF13 in HEK293 cells compared with PTBP2 alone (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6E</xref>), suggesting that the enhanced binding of PTBP2 to <italic>FGF13</italic> 5′-UTR is able to increase the protein translation. Then, we try to rescue the PTBP2 binding to endogenous mutant <italic>Fgf13</italic> 5′-UTR in neurons of mutant mice. Pumilio/fem-3 mRNA-binding factor (PUF) was reported to specifically recognize and bind to a fragment of 8-nucleotide RNA sequence to artificially increase the binding affinity between the RNA and the PUF-fused protein (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Dong et al., 2011</xref>). According to the engineering principle (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Choudhury et al., 2012</xref>), PTBP2 was fused with ‘wildtype-recognition’ PUF (wPUF-PTBP2, recognizing the wildtype RNA sequence UCUC<bold>C</bold>UGG) or with ‘mutant-recognition’ PUF (mPUF-PTBP2, recognizing the mutant RNA sequence UCUC<bold>G</bold>UGG), respectively (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6F</xref>). Notably, PTBP2 in these two fusion proteins could normally bind to wildtype mouse <italic>Fgf13</italic> 5′-UTR, but had a lower binding affinity with mutant <italic>Fgf13</italic> 5′-UTR. Thus, wPUF-PTBP2 binds to wildtype <italic>Fgf13</italic> 5′-UTR either through wPUF or PTBP2, but both bindings are reduced in mutant <italic>Fgf13</italic> 5′-UTR; mPUF-PTBP2 could enhance the binding to mutant <italic>Fgf13</italic> 5′-UTR through its mPUF domain. The binding affinity was further verified by RNA pull-down assay. The level of mPUF-PTBP2 pull-downed by the synthesized mutant RNA was increased to the level similar to that by the synthesized wildtype RNA, while wPUF-PTBP2 could only partially bind with the synthesized mutation-carrying RNA (~65% of binding with the synthesized wildtype RNA) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6G</xref>), suggesting that the engineered mPUF-PTBP2 increases the binding of PTBP2 with mutant <italic>Fgf13</italic> 5′-UTR. Moreover, we tested whether the increase in the binding affinity between PTBP2 and mutant <italic>Fgf13</italic> 5′-UTR could enhance the <italic>Fgf13</italic> translation in mice. For efficient expression of wPUF-PTBP2 and mPUF-PTBP2 in cultured cortical neurons, we used lentivirus to infect neurons of <italic>Fgf13</italic> mutant mice (see Materials and methods). Immunoblotting showed that the expression of mPUF-PTBP2 increased the FGF13 protein level in the cortical neurons of mutant mice, although wPUF-PTBP2 had no effect on FGF13 expression (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6H</xref>). Therefore, the enhanced binding of PTBP2 to mutant <italic>Fgf13</italic> 5′-UTR is able to rescue the impaired protein translation.</p><p>We finally examined whether abnormal neuronal development of mutant mice could be rescued by mPUF-PTBP2. Cortical neurons cultured from <italic>Fgf13</italic> mutant mice had decreased polarity and increased axon branching, while expressing mPUF-PTBP2 but not wPUF-PTBP2 could rescue these defects (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6I</xref>), consistent with the finding that the expression of mPUF-PTBP2 rather than wPUF-PTBP2 increased the FGF13 protein level in cortical neurons of mutant mice (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6H</xref>).

FGF13 is transiently expressed in the cerebral cortex from E14 until P14 with a peak level at P7 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib86">Wu et al., 2012</xref>). FGF13 is another recently identified MSP, and the deficiency of FGF13 disrupts the MT stabilization, thus leading to axon/leading process branching and delayed neuronal migration in both cerebral cortex and the CA1 region of hippocampus in mice. Learning and memory were impaired in FGF13-deficient mice, although the positioning of neurons in the cerebral cortex and hippocampus of adult mutant mice became similar to that in normal mice (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib86">Wu et al., 2012</xref>). In the present study, mice with the point mutation of <italic>Fgf13</italic> 5′-UTR showed the defects of neuronal polarization, axon branching, and neuronal migration similar to that of <italic>Fgf13</italic> knockout mice, consistent with the finding that the point mutation attenuated the FGF13 expression in mouse brain. Notably, the impaired spine formation in the hippocampus suggests that the aberrant neural circuit establishment in adult <italic>Fgf13</italic> mutant mice may involve in the behavioral deficits. In addition to the function of FGF13 in neuronal development, FGF13 was also reported to bind to and regulate the function of voltage-gated sodium channels at the Ranvier nodes along the myelinated nerve fibers (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib85">Wittmack et al., 2004</xref>), at the axon initial segment of hippocampal neurons (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Goetz et al., 2009</xref>), and in DRG neurons (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib88">Yang et al., 2017</xref>). Further analysis of electrophysiological recordings to examine the efficiency of synaptic transmission in mutant mice could help to understand the mechanisms correlated with the defects of learning and memory behavior.</p><p>Mutations influencing the coding region of genes could alter the protein sequence and result in the dysfunctions in many human diseases. However, mutations in the noncoding region of genes are involved in various regulating mechanisms and relatively difficult to study. Studies using the exome sequencing to screen variations in the gene landscapes hardly give information on the noncoding region of genome that have important roles in regulating gene transcription, translation, stability, and many other aspects (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Chatterjee and Pal, 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Barrett et al., 2012</xref>). Genes involved in numerous important cellular functions, such as fertilization, development, and cell cycle, are regulated at the level of translation. Certain changes in the UTR of genes are associated with various diseases, indicating the critical function of noncoding regions (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib66">Signori et al., 2001</xref>). Moreover, mutations located on 5′-UTR are related to several genetic diseases (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib40">Kondo et al., 1998</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib76">Tassone et al., 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib63">Scheper et al., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib79">Wang et al., 2007</xref>) and involved in different ways to influence the gene translation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Chatterjee and Pal, 2009</xref>). The 5′-UTR length, GC content, and thermal stability, as well as its secondary structures, multiple uORFs, and IRES could influence overall translation rate. Furthermore, the 5′-UTR has numerous binding sites for proteins that may repress or promote translation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Chatterjee and Pal, 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Barrett et al., 2012</xref>). For example, a G&gt;C mutation in <italic>BRCA1</italic> 5′-UTR was identified in a highly aggressive sporadic breast cancer and resulted in a defective initiation of BRCA1 protein translation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib66">Signori et al., 2001</xref>).</p><p>In the present study, we provide several lines of evidence showing that the SNP in the <italic>FGF13</italic> 5′-UTR of ID patients causes a reduction of <italic>FGF13</italic> translation by attenuated binding with RNA-binding proteins PTBP1/2. First, the point mutation in <italic>FGF13</italic> 5′-UTR decreased the expression of FGF13 in HEK293 cells, patient iPSCs, and <italic>Fgf13</italic> mutant mice. Second, the polysome profiling assay and examination of mRNA binding on translating ribosomes showed that the ribosome entry of FGF13 mRNAs was reduced, which may cause a decreased efficiency of <italic>Fgf13</italic> translation in the mutant mice. Third, the RNA pull-down assay detected that the 5′-UTR SNP attenuated the binding of <italic>FGF13</italic> 5′-UTR with both PTBP1 and PTBP2. Finally, an increase of the binding between PTBP2 and <italic>FGF13</italic> 5′-UTR with MS2/MCP system or mutant <italic>Fgf13</italic> 5′-UTR with mPUF-PTBP2 rescued the translation of FGF13. Specific increase of the binding affinity between RNA and related PUF-fused PTBP2, rather than direct overexpression of PTBP2, may bypass potential side effects due to the important biological roles of PTBP2 in neuronal development (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">Hu et al., 2018</xref>). Obviously, our study provides another case for the importance of noncoding SNPs in the dysfunction of protein synthesis and the pathogenicity of ID. PTBP1/2 usually play major roles in regulating pre-mRNA splicing by binding to pyrimidine-rich sequences. They could also affect miRNA function and cytoplasmic translation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib62">Sawicka et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">Kafasla et al., 2012</xref>). Our study provides further evidence for the cytoplasmic function of PTBPs in FGF13 translation.</p><p>The next-generation sequencing of various disease cases could produce numerous data across whole human exome or genome (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Exome Aggregation Consortium et al., 2016</xref>). To find the pathological mutations related to ID among these massive data, we need a fast approach to screen these mutations. First effort is usually made to screen out pathogenic variants from remaining background ones (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Gilissen et al., 2014</xref>), and the second step is to verify the pathogenic functions and mechanisms. The generation of patient-derived iPSCs from easily harvested renal epithelial cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib97">Zhou et al., 2012</xref>) and CRISPR/Cas9 gene editing may provide convenient tools to study the functions of numerous gene mutations and thus accelerate the studies of ID genomic spectrum (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib73">Takahashi et al., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">Jinek et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib47">Mali et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib56">Ran et al., 2013</xref>). Subsequently, the induced NPCs and functional neurons from iPSCs further facilitate the study of the functions and mechanisms of neural diseases in human (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Chambers et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib65">Shi et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib82">Wapinski et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib92">Zhang et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib60">Sakaguchi et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib74">Tao and Zhang, 2016</xref>). The mouse models inspired by mutations from human diseases could perform standard examinations from neurons and neural circuits to behaviors; therefore, new technologies to generate the mutation-introduced mice (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib95">Zhong et al., 2015</xref>) provide us with a rapid and efficient strategy to screen the pathogenic mutations from big scale of data, thus leading to the ‘phenotype-omics’ for each genetic variations. Recently, the semi-cloning technology was used to identify the pathogenic combinations of genetic variants in mouse model for a complex disease Müllerian anomalies (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib81">Wang et al., 2020</xref>). It would largely benefit the genetic etiological and pathological studies of ID and any other diseases. However, the development of human brain is more complicated, and some human neural diseases have more severe phenotypes than those in mice (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Gleeson et al., 1998</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">Kappeler et al., 2006</xref>). The studies are still required to correlate the degree of changes at cell and mouse models with the patients suffering from human neural diseases.</p></sec><sec id="s4" sec-type="materials|methods"><title>Materials and methods</title><table-wrap id="keyresource" position="anchor"><label>Key resources table</label><table frame="hsides" rules="groups"><thead><tr><th valign="top">Reagent type <break/>(species) or resource</th><th valign="top">Designation</th><th valign="top">Source or reference</th><th valign="top">Identifiers</th><th valign="top">Additional information</th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td>Genetic reagent (<italic>Mus musculus</italic>) male and female</td><td><italic>Fgf13</italic> mutant</td><td>This paper</td><td>Home-made</td><td>Obtained by contacting the correspondence author</td></tr><tr><td>Antibody</td><td>Anti-FGF13(goat polyclonal)</td><td>Santa Cruz</td><td>Cat# sc-16811 RRID:<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://scicrunch.org/resolver/AB_2104044">AB_2104044</ext-link></td><td>IB (1:500)</td></tr><tr><td>Antibody</td><td>Anti-FGF13(rabbit polyclonal)</td><td><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib86">Wu et al., 2012</xref></td><td>Home-made by immunization with FGF13B 182–192 aa</td><td>IB (1:5000)</td></tr><tr><td>Antibody</td><td>Anti-HA(mouse monoclonal)</td><td>Sigma</td><td>Cat# H3663 RRID:<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://scicrunch.org/resolver/AB_262051">AB_262051</ext-link></td><td>IB (1:2000);

Your article has been reviewed by 3 peer reviewers, one of whom is a member of our Board of Reviewing Editors, and the evaluation has been overseen by Huda Zoghbi as the Senior Editor. The following individuals involved in review of your submission have agreed to reveal their identity: Fernanda Laezza (Reviewer #2); Gene W Yeo (Reviewer #3).</p><p>The reviewers have discussed the reviews with one another and the Reviewing Editor has drafted this decision to help you prepare a revised submission.</p><p>As the editors have judged that your manuscript is of interest, but as described below that additional experiments are required before it is published, we would like to draw your attention to changes in our revision policy that we have made in response to COVID-19 (https://elifesciences.org/articles/57162). First, because many researchers have temporarily lost access to the labs, we will give authors as much time as they need to submit revised manuscripts. We are also offering, if you choose, to post the manuscript to bioRxiv (if it is not already there) along with this decision letter and a formal designation that the manuscript is &quot;in revision at <italic>eLife</italic>&quot;. Please let us know if you would like to pursue this option. (If your work is more suitable for medRxiv, you will need to post the preprint yourself, as the mechanisms for us to do so are still in development.)</p><p>Summary:</p><p>This paper presents translational work aimed at connecting a SNP in the 5' UTR of FGF13 associated with intellectual disabilities with a surprising molecular mechanism involving the binding of a factor PTBP2 (usually associated with splicing) to enhance translational efficiency. The authors present a substantial amount of data including the analysis of protein production in vitro, in patient-derived iPSCs and in an ad hoc animal model carrying the mutation. While there were many strengths to the study, reviewers had concerns about the depth of analysis to support the novel molecular mechanism. The shift in the polysome profiles of the mRNA was modest and requires replicates to be convincing, the tethering reporter with PUF proteins was complicated by the endogenous proteins in the cell and would be clearer with a simpler experiment, and it was felt that more support was needed to establish interactions between PTBP2 and the SNP in the iPSCs.</p><p>Essential revisions:</p><p>1. Provide replicates for Figure 4B.</p><p>2. Consider a more simple tethering assay allowing for simpler interpretation and a more convincing conclusion.</p><p>3. Perform RIP type experiments in iPSCs to establish interaction between SNP and endogenous PTBP2.</p><p>4, Provide better graphic representation of the cellular phenotyping data (i.e. additional images, higher magnification, additional parameters measured)</p><p><italic>Reviewer #1:</italic></p><p>In this work, Pan et al. seek to expand our understanding of protein expression and how this contributes to human disease. The authors focus on FGF13 because of recent advancements suggesting its involvement in neural development and identify a C≥G SNP in the 5'UTR of FGF13 which is found in 3 male ID patients and is therefore enriched in the ID patient population relative to the general population (~2% compared to ~0.1-0.3%). Based on whole-genome sequencing of the affected individuals, the authors posit that this SNP may be causal for ID. The rest of the work takes this SNP into cell culture and mouse models in order to understand how it contributes to the ID phenotype. The authors observe modest isoform-specific reductions in protein levels of FGF13 in SNP-harboring HEK293 cells, iPSCs from patients, iPSC-derived neurons, and in mouse neural tissue. Mice feature slight behavioral and memory impairments, and slight defects in neural migration, polarization, and branching. Polysome profiling and ribosome-IP experiments suggest that the SNP slightly decreases FGF13 mRNA association with translating ribosomes. Mass spectrometry identifies PTBP1 and PTBP2 as proteins which preferentially associate with the WT 5'UTR of FGF13 over the SNP-containing 5'UTR. The authors show that decreasing PTBP expression also decreases FGF13 expression, and a tethering assay is attempted to show that recruitment of PTBP2 to the FGF13 5'UTR drives expression. Together, this combination of data leads the authors to propose a model whereby the C≥G SNP disrupts PTBP2 binding to the FGF13 5'UTR, leading to decreased FGF13 protein expression, disrupted neural development, and ultimately the ID phenotype.</p><p>While this work presents an intriguing model for regulation of FGF13, there are several key concerns that limit enthusiasm for publication at this stage.</p><p>1) The effect sizes throughout the cell culture and mouse model experiments are small. Slight decreases are observed in FGF13 protein expression and in neuronal migration and branching, and the mouse behavioral and memory impairments appear to be small and unenlightening due to the random assortment of positive and negative behavioral assays. These modest effect sizes stand in stark contrast to the severe ID phenotypes observed in the affected patients (IQ &lt; 40, significant deficiencies in adaptive behaviors). This is concerning and calls to question whether the C≥G SNP is actually causal for the ID phenotype, or whether the mouse is an appropriate model to study the FGF13 5'UTR despite demonstrated conservation at the SNP site. A discussion of ID penetrance for humans harboring this SNP is warranted since ~0.1-0.3% of the population appears to carry this SNP.</p><p>2) The evidence for translational regulation is very modest – the small redistribution of FGF13 mRNA on the polysome gradient to a lighter fraction in Figure 4 seems unlikely to report on the ~25% decrease in protein expression reported in Figure 2D. This assay can be a useful one for looking at translational regulation but a greater shift would be more compelling (see Figure 2C in Tahmasebi et al., Cell Stem Cell (2014) for an example of a more compelling shift).</p><p>3) The authors model is predicated on a role of the PTBPs as enhancers of mRNA translation, whereas prior evidence suggests the major role of PTBPs to be in splicing. While this would be a novel and interesting role for PTBPs, the authors do not adequately discuss the known functions of PTBPs or canonical PTBP binding motifs, and do little experimentally to convince the reader of this novel function (e.g. subcellular localization).

As shown in Figure 6C, the MS2-binding motif was inserted into the 5’-UTR of FGF13 mRNA. This MS2-FGF13 mRNA exhibited an increased binding to MS2 coat protein (MCP)-fused PTBP2, which was revealed by the RIP experiment (see Figure 6D). Moreover, recruitment of PTBP2 to FGF13 mRNA could increase the protein level of FGF13 (see Figure 6E).

The authors focus on FGF13 because of recent advancements suggesting its involvement in neural development and identify a C≥G SNP in the 5'UTR of FGF13 which is found in 3 male ID patients and is therefore enriched in the ID patient population relative to the general population (~2% compared to ~0.1-0.3%). Based on whole-genome sequencing of the affected individuals, the authors posit that this SNP may be causal for ID. The rest of the work takes this SNP into cell culture and mouse models in order to understand how it contributes to the ID phenotype. The authors observe modest isoform-specific reductions in protein levels of FGF13 in SNP-harboring HEK293 cells, iPSCs from patients, iPSC-derived neurons, and in mouse neural tissue. Mice feature slight behavioral and memory impairments, and slight defects in neural migration, polarization, and branching. Polysome profiling and ribosome-IP experiments suggest that the SNP slightly decreases FGF13 mRNA association with translating ribosomes. Mass spectrometry identifies PTBP1 and PTBP2 as proteins which preferentially associate with the WT 5'UTR of FGF13 over the SNP-containing 5'UTR. The authors show that decreasing PTBP expression also decreases FGF13 expression, and a tethering assay is attempted to show that recruitment of PTBP2 to the FGF13 5'UTR drives expression. Together, this combination of data leads the authors to propose a model whereby the C≥G SNP disrupts PTBP2 binding to the FGF13 5'UTR, leading to decreased FGF13 protein expression, disrupted neural development, and ultimately the ID phenotype.</p><p>While this work presents an intriguing model for regulation of FGF13, there are several key concerns that limit enthusiasm for publication at this stage.</p><p>1) The effect sizes throughout the cell culture and mouse model experiments are small. Slight decreases are observed in FGF13 protein expression and in neuronal migration and branching, and the mouse behavioral and memory impairments appear to be small and unenlightening due to the random assortment of positive and negative behavioral assays. These modest effect sizes stand in stark contrast to the severe ID phenotypes observed in the affected patients (IQ &lt; 40, significant deficiencies in adaptive behaviors). This is concerning and calls to question whether the C≥G SNP is actually causal for the ID phenotype, or whether the mouse is an appropriate model to study the FGF13 5'UTR despite demonstrated conservation at the SNP site. A discussion of ID penetrance for humans harboring this SNP is warranted since ~0.1-0.3% of the population appears to carry this SNP.</p></disp-quote><p>Nowadays, mouse models provide valuable clues for the function and mechanism research of human neural diseases. In the present study, we also used human cellular models directly from patients to test the function of the SNP, and the results were consistent with our animal studies (at molecular, cellular and behavior levels). We agree with the reviewer that the effect sizes in cellular model and mouse model were modest. The studies are still required to correlate the degree of changes at cell culture and mouse models with the patients suffering from human neural diseases. Although the gap exists between human and mouse in their development process, the mouse is still a useful model for human neural diseases. Actually, the development of human brain is more complicated, and some human neural diseases have more severe phenotypes than those in mice. One example is doublecortin (DCX), which is a classical microtubule-associated protein. Patients with mutant DCX have lissencephaly and double cortex syndrome (Gleeson et al., 1998), while the loss of DCX in rats or mice only results in increased axon branching and delayed neuronal migration (Bai et al., 2003; Kappeler et al., 2006). Now we added the discussion in line 895-899, page 47 in the Discussion.</p><p>According to the reviewer’s comment, we have modified the description “In three families of the present study, all male carriers exhibited ID phenotypes. However, whether the allele frequency in general population (~0.2%) comes from unaffected female carriers or from reduced penetrance of male carriers is still unknown. The true penetrance of the SNP in general population could only be estimated based on data from more families of affected individuals.” in line 796-801, page 42 in the Discussion.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>2) The evidence for translational regulation is very modest – the small redistribution of FGF13 mRNA on the polysome gradient to a lighter fraction in Figure 4 seems unlikely to report on the ~25% decrease in protein expression reported in Figure 2D. This assay can be a useful one for looking at translational regulation but a greater shift would be more compelling (see Figure 2C in Tahmasebi et al., Cell Stem Cell (2014) for an example of a more compelling shift).</p></disp-quote><p>According to the reviewer’s suggestion, we performed recommended assay to further look at translational regulation. The semi-quantitative PCR following the polysome profiling from 3 wildtype and 3 mutant mice also detected that FGF13 mRNA showed less association with heavy polysomes in mutant mice. This result was shown in the format of that in Tahmasebi et al., Cell Stem Cell (2014) and added in Figure 4—figure supplement 1B-1C.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>3) The authors model is predicated on a role of the PTBPs as enhancers of mRNA translation, whereas prior evidence suggests the major role of PTBPs to be in splicing. While this would be a novel and interesting role for PTBPs, the authors do not adequately discuss the known functions of PTBPs or canonical PTBP binding motifs, and do little experimentally to convince the reader of this novel function (e.g. subcellular localization). Finally, the experimental setup and interpretations of the tethering assay (Figure 6) are convoluted and provide no support for their model. Tethering is a valuable tool as it obviates the need for a well-defined binding site, but that is the way to utilize it – recruitment of PTBP2 to an orthogonal site such as an MS2 binding motif would be a cleaner method to show that PTBP recruitment is sufficient to drive translation of the FGF13 mRNA.</p></disp-quote><p>According to the reviewer’s suggestion, we added a simpler strategy in HEK293 cells, in which we used the MS2-binding motif to recruit PTBP2 to exogenous FGF13 mRNA.
