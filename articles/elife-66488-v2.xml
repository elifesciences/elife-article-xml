neuronal Na<sup>+</sup> channels that are activated by a drop in pH. Their established physiological and pathological roles, involving fear behaviors, learning, pain sensation, and neurodegeneration after stroke, make them promising targets for future drugs. Currently, the ASIC activation mechanism is not understood. Here, we used voltage-clamp fluorometry (VCF) combined with fluorophore-quencher pairing to determine the kinetics and direction of movements. We show that conformational changes with the speed of channel activation occur close to the gate and in more distant extracellular sites, where they may be driven by local protonation events. Further, we provide evidence for fast conformational changes in a pathway linking protonation sites to the channel pore, in which an extracellular interdomain loop interacts via aromatic residue interactions with the upper end of a transmembrane helix and would thereby open the gate.</p></abstract><kwd-group kwd-group-type="author-keywords"><kwd>conformational change</kwd><kwd>ion channel</kwd><kwd>voltage-clamp fluorometry</kwd><kwd>molecular dynamics</kwd><kwd>kinetic model</kwd></kwd-group><kwd-group kwd-group-type="research-organism"><title>Research organism</title><kwd>Human</kwd></kwd-group><funding-group><award-group id="fund1"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100001711</institution-id><institution>Schweizerischer Nationalfonds zur Förderung der Wissenschaftlichen Forschung</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>31003A_172968</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Kellenberger</surname><given-names>Stephan</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><funding-statement>The funders had no role in study design, data collection and interpretation, or the decision to submit the work for publication.</funding-statement></funding-group><custom-meta-group><custom-meta specific-use="meta-only"><meta-name>Author impact statement</meta-name><meta-value>Analysis of conformational changes indicates that activation of acid-sensing ion channels involves protonation of diverse extracellular sites and interaction of interdomain loops with the upper ends of transmembrane helices.</meta-value></custom-meta></custom-meta-group></article-meta></front><body><sec id="s1" sec-type="intro"><title>Introduction</title><p>This study investigates the activation mechanism of acid-sensing ion channels (ASICs), a family of H<sup>+</sup>-gated Na<sup>+</sup> channels of the nervous system (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib49">Waldmann et al., 1997</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib50">Wemmie et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Kellenberger and Schild, 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib53">Yang and Palmer, 2014</xref>).

The lower palm domains enclose the central vestibule. The wrist links the extracellular channel parts to the transmembrane segments. The acidic pocket, the palm and the wrist are pH-sensing regions that are potentially involved in ASIC activation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">Paukert et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Krauson et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Liechti et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib48">Vullo et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib43">Schuhmacher et al., 2015</xref>). It is expected that protonation would locally induce structural rearrangements, and these conformational changes would be transmitted to the gate. It may also be possible that the opening of the ASIC1a gate is controlled by protonation events in the wrist alone, since combined mutation of two putative pH-sensing His residues in the wrist suppressed ASIC1a activation, while maintaining cell surface expression intact (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">Paukert et al., 2008</xref>).</p><p>By using voltage-clamp fluorometry (VCF), we show here that conformational changes with the kinetics of ASIC activation occur in the wrist and in several distal extracellular parts, consistent with pH sensing in different channel regions. To investigate possible pathways transmitting conformational changes from distant sites to the channel gate, we determined the kinetics and direction of conformational changes in the palm and the adjacent palm-thumb loops, using VCF combined with the introduction of fluorescence quencher groups. The fluorescence signals were analyzed with a kinetic model to further support the attribution of fluorescence changes to specific functional transitions. This analysis allowed us to propose sequences of conformational rearrangements in ASIC domains in the proximity of the β1-β2 linker during activation and desensitization. Inspection of the crystal structures, and unbiased Molecular Dynamics (MD) simulations were used to interpret the VCF predictions.</p></sec><sec id="s2" sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><sec id="s2-1"><title>Fast conformational changes in ASIC domains that are distant from the pore</title><p>The aim of a first set of experiments was to compare the kinetics of conformational changes in different parts of ASIC1a. To this end, VCF was used, which measures simultaneously with the channel current, changes in fluorescence (ΔF) of a strategically placed fluorophore, as a readout of changes in its environment. ASIC1a constructs containing engineered Cys residues for the docking of maleimide derivatives of fluorophores were expressed in <italic>Xenopus laevis</italic> oocytes, and oocytes were exposed to maleimide derivatives of AlexaFluor488 or CF488A prior to the measurement. The ΔF signals detected in labeled mutants are due to fluorophores attached to the engineered Cys residues, since exposure of wild-type (WT) ASIC1a to the maleimide derivatives of these two fluorophores does not lead to fluorescence changes upon acidification (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Bonifacio et al., 2014</xref>).</p><p>In previous studies, we had observed rapid ΔF signals with mutations located distantly from the channel gate (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Bonifacio et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Gwiazda et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib48">Vullo et al., 2017</xref>). For an accurate comparison of the kinetics of these mutants (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1B</xref>), they were measured here in a measuring chamber in which the current and ΔF signal are measured from approximately the same oocyte surface (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1C</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib48">Vullo et al., 2017</xref>). The tested mutants produced transient currents upon extracellular acidification (black traces in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1D</xref>). The ΔF signals of these mutants (red traces) were sustained; only E355C showed an additional first transient component. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1E</xref> presents for acidification to pH6 the rise time (time to pass from 10% to 90% of the maximal amplitude, RT) of the ΔF onset (red symbols) and of the current appearance (black), and the decay time (90% to 10%) of the current desensitization (green). The kinetic analysis illustrates that for most of these mutants, the ΔF onset kinetics are similar to those of current appearance (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1E</xref>). To determine how closely the conformational changes underlying the ΔF signals were associated with a functional transition, a correlation analysis was done for each mutant (Materials and methods). This indicated a correlation to channel activation for K105C, K133C, and E355C (purple label). The results obtained at pH6.5 and 5.5 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1</xref>) were comparable with those at pH6.0 shown here.</p><p>The ΔF signals indicate that the environment of the docked fluorophores changes, thus that the acidification induces conformational changes. The ΔF may be due to changes in solvent exposure of the fluorophore (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Gandhi and Olcese, 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Cha and Bezanilla, 1997</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Mannuzzu et al., 1996</xref>), or to changes of the exposure to nearby quenching groups (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">Pantazis and Olcese, 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib48">Vullo et al., 2017</xref>). It is expected that conformational transitions that are not directly associated with a defined functional state also influence the fluorescence signal. As an additional strategy for testing the association of ΔF signals with specific transitions, ΔF traces were compared to traces generated by a kinetic model under the assumption that each functional state contributes with a proportionality factor that lies between −1 and +1 to the measured fluorescence. To this end, a kinetic ASIC1a model recently developed in our laboratory was used (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Alijevic et al., 2020</xref>), which is based on the Hodgkin-Huxley formalism containing an activation and a sensitization gate. The model contains four states, an open (O), a closed (C) and two desensitized states, closed-desensitized (CD) and open-desensitized (OD; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1F</xref>). This model reproduces the acid-induced ASIC1a activity well (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Alijevic et al., 2020</xref>). <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1G</xref> shows ΔF traces generated by this model for a pH change from 7.4 to 6.0, under the assumption that in each case one single functional state, or a pair, O+OD (corresponding to the activation gate) and CD+OD (sensitization gate) contributes to the signal. The ΔF onset is most rapid for the fluorescence associated with the O or O+OD states. The CD state is associated with a substantial ΔF only at the return to pH7.4 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1G</xref>). At the end of the acidic pulse when the pH is changed back to 7.4, the return to the initial fluorescence level is slow if the fluorescence is associated with the CD state, consistent with the slow recovery from desensitization at pH7.4 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Alijevic et al., 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib41">Rook et al., 2020</xref>).</p><p>By attributing proportionality factors between −1 and +1 to the four states of the model, based on the shape and the kinetics of experimental ΔF traces (Materials and methods, experimental values of the ΔF kinetics at the return to the conditioning pH are provided in <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="supp1">Supplementary file 1</xref>), ΔF signals can be generated that closely resemble the measured ΔF signals, as illustrated by the blue traces shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1D</xref>, where the proportionality factors (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="supp2">Supplementary file 2</xref>) are indicated for each mutant.

The timing in the animation is not indicative of the timing of the distance changes in the represented pairs.</p></caption></media><p>To provide a structural interpretation of at least some of the predicted conformational changes, an unbiased MD simulation of a structural model of hASIC1a was carried out. Molecular dynamics simulations have been used extensively to study biomolecular processes at atomic resolutions, including ion channel activation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Bignucolo et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Kasimova et al., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Lynagh et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Hadden et al., 2018</xref>). The MD simulation was conducted for a duration of 740 ns with hASIC1a in the resting state, embedded in a membrane and protonated according to a pH of 5, based on pKa calculations (Materials and methods). These conditions mimic an acidification administered to a closed channel. They would therefore initiate conformational changes leading to channel opening. In this short MD simulation, it may be possible to observe initial transitions that would ultimately lead to channel opening. To identify possible distance changes between residues at the level of the side chains, the evolution of these distances over time was plotted for the six pairs identified by VCF in the closed-open transition (<xref ref-type="table" rid="table1">Table 1</xref>). Two changes were effectively observed in the trajectories (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7A–B</xref>, <xref ref-type="video" rid="video2">Video 2</xref>), an increase of the distance between Ser83 and 'Gln358 from initially 5.7 Å (average during the first 20 ns of simulation, for three subunits) to 8.4 Å (average during the last 200 ns of simulation), and an approaching between Ser83 and 'Glu359 from 8.1 Å to 6.1 Å. The distances within the other four pairs did not change during this period. Snapshots at 6 and 640 ns of the simulation illustrate that the side chains of 'Gln358 and 'Glu359 exchange their orientation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7D</xref>). Further inspection of the MD simulations showed a continuous decrease of the distance between the side chains of 'Glu359 and Lys211, from initially 18.4 to 10.1 Å (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7C</xref>, <xref ref-type="video" rid="video2">Video 2</xref>). In one of the subunit interfaces, the distance between the side chains decreased from 16.9 to 3.8 Å, a distance that was maintained during the last 100 ns of simulation and is compatible with the formation of a salt bridge. These observations suggest that 'Glu359 might engage transiently in electrostatic interactions with Lys211 during the first steps of the channel activation. In a recent study we observed that the distance between 'Glu359 and the neighboring palm domain was correlated with the pH dependence of activation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Bignucolo et al., 2020</xref>), suggesting that facilitating the decrease of this distance would enhance the activation probability.</p><fig id="fig7" position="float"><label>Figure 7.</label><caption><title>Structural interpretation of selected VCF-predicted distance changes.</title><p>(<bold>A–D</bold>) Data and structural images based on unbiased MD simulations starting from a closed structural model of hASIC1a, in which the protonation of residues mimicked pH5.

First, the approaching between 'Thr289 and the neighboring β1-β2 linker, already observed during opening, was continued during desensitization, whereas a comparison of the crystal structures indicates an increase of the A81-'T289 distance upon desensitization. Thr289 is located close to the β-turn in the β9-β4 loop. In cASIC1a, Thr289 is replaced by an Asp residue, which could engage in different interactions with the neighboring Lys292 (Lys291 in hASIC1a). In addition, this loop is relatively poorly resolved in the crystal structure, since residues 297 and 298 (hASIC1a-296 and −297) are missing, thus possibly decreasing the reliability of some structural distances. Secondly, the distance increase between Ala81 and 'Leu369 of the neighboring palm contradicts the structure predictions. Comparison of the human and chicken ASIC1a structures does not reveal any obvious explanation for the contradiction related to the Ala81 - 'Leu369 pair. Leu369 is located within a narrow pocket of hydrophobic residues. Since Ala81 is located close to Leu415 and Asn416 that undergo an isomerization during desensitization (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Baconguis and Gouaux, 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib41">Rook et al., 2020</xref>), it may be involved in conformational changes linked to this isomerization. Thirdly, VCF predicted a distance increase between Ala81 and Met210 of the proximal β5-β6 loop, while the comparison of the crystal structures indicated a 3 Å decrease of this distance. One difference between human and chicken ASIC1a in the proximity of Met210 is the residue at position 208, which is a Lys in human, and Ile in chicken ASIC1a. In both isoforms, an Arg residue is located at two positions more distal on the β5-β6 loop, hASIC1a-Arg206, and cASIC1a-Arg207. Chicken ASIC1a contains an Arg residue in the β1-β2 linker at the position homologous to hASIC1a-Gln84. Thus, in cASIC1a, there is one basic side chain each in this range of the β1-β2 linker and β5-β6 loop (Arg85 and Arg207), while in hASIC1a, the two basic residues are located on the β5-β6 loop (Lys208 and Arg206). It is not clear whether these amino acid substitutions may be at the origin of the difference between VCF- and structure-based predictions regarding the movement of the proximal β5-β6 loop relative to the β1-β2 linker.</p><p>The open and desensitized structural models show no difference in distance between the β1-β2 linker and the distal residues Pro205 and Arg206 of the β5-β6 loop, nor between Gln84 and Tyr417 (<xref ref-type="table" rid="table2">Table 2</xref>), while VCF predicts in these cases an approaching. These differences arise likely from the fact that the residue homologous to hASIC1a-Gln84 is an Arg in cASIC1a, as mentioned above. In cASIC1a, the approaching between the β1-β2 linker and the distal β5-β6 loop would bring Arg85 and Arg207 (homologous to hASIC1a-Arg206) close to each other, which is unlikely to occur due to the repulsion between basic residues (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7E</xref>). In both cASIC1a and hASIC1a open structures, Arg280 (hASIC1a-Arg279) forms a cation-π interaction with Tyr416 (hASIC1a-Tyr417), since the guanidium group is stacked over and located within 6 Å from the aromatic ring. In hASIC1a, Gln84, which is located within a loop and exposed to the solvent, can easily approach the Arg279 side chain (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7E</xref>, center panel). While this distance seems too large to support stable electrostatic interactions, the structural comparison shows that this residue does not constitute a barrier like Arg85 in cASIC1 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7E</xref>, right panel).</p><table-wrap id="table2" position="float"><label>Table 2.</label><caption><title>Distances between Cys / quencher pairs.</title><p>The distances were calculated between the β-carbon residues of the indicated residues from structural models of the closed (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib54">Yoder et al., 2018</xref> PDB code 5WKU), Mit-toxin-opened (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Baconguis et al., 2014</xref> 4NTW) and desensitized state (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Gonzales et al., 2009</xref> 4NYK) of hASIC1a in Chimera (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">Pettersen et al., 2004</xref>).

Our VCF analysis indicates that fast conformational changes tend to occur more in the two thumb-palm loops, while slower changes occur in the palm. The lower thumb-palm loop contains the β-turn that interacts with the TM1 and may, via this interaction, lead to the opening of the channel gate (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8">Figure 8A</xref>).</p><sec id="s3-1"><title>Association of ΔF signals with functional transitions</title><p>To test for an association between ΔF signals and functional transitions, the kinetics of current and ΔF signals were compared. This showed, comparable to many other VCF studies, that some ΔF signals are timely associated with defined functional transitions, while many mutants showed intermediate kinetics, likely because they report conformational changes that are not directly associated with the channel gate but may be part of processes that precede and lead to the functional transition. In addition to this analysis, we have applied kinetic modeling that assumed that the fluorescence signal is a linear combination of the probabilities of finding the ASICs in individual functional states. Although care must be taken when assigning predefined fluorescence levels to given states, and although this simple model does not consider any intermediate states and is based on WT ASIC1a, it was able to reproduce most of the measured ΔF signals rather well. The scaling factors in these models suggested for most mutants that the open and open-desensitized states were the principal contributors to the ΔF signal.</p><p>For the interpretation of VCF data, potential limitations have to be taken into consideration. VCF is carried out with mutants, and although mutants are selected that have similar properties as the WT, there are differences with regard to the kinetics and the ligand concentration dependence. In this study, ΔF kinetics were directly compared to the current kinetics, therefore the conclusions were not influenced by kinetic differences of the mutants to the WT. VCF measurements were done in the pH range 6.5–5.5 and were qualitatively similar over this range. Since for the vast majority of the tested mutants, the pH<sub>50</sub> shift relative to the WT was &lt;0.5 pH units, these shifts do not influence the conclusions.</p><p>Experiments with ultrarapid perfusion systems have shown that ASICs activate with time constants of the order of 10 ms (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Bässler et al., 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib46">Sutherland et al., 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Alijevic et al., 2020</xref>). In the measuring chamber used in this study, the RT of solution change was ~300 ms (Materials and methods). The measured kinetics were therefore limited by the speed of solution change, and since the measured RTs of many mutants were faster than 300 ms, peak amplitudes were probably reached before the solution was completely exchanged (Materials and methods). In each experiment and for each condition, the kinetics of ΔF and current were directly compared, providing thus correct conclusions of the ΔF kinetics relative to the current kinetics, and therefore a valid attribution of the ΔF signals to functional transitions. In the interpretation of the data, it has to be considered that the absolute speed of the measured kinetics was limited by the speed of the solution change, and that the actual pH of the measurement of the kinetics was slightly more alkaline than that of the test solution.</p></sec><sec id="s3-2"><title>Dissociation of ΔF and current pH dependence</title><p>The pH dependence of the ΔF signal was in most mutants, even mutants associated with activation, shifted to more alkaline values than the pH dependence of current activation, and closer to the pH dependence of SSD. Such a shift has been observed in previous studies (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib48">Vullo et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Bonifacio et al., 2014</xref>). An alkaline shift was observed here even with the non-desensitizing mutant A81C/Y417V/T209W, thus it does not indicate a link to desensitization. It is thought that in ASICs, as in other ion channels, conformational changes in different parts of the channel will eventually lead to the opening of the channel pore. The pH dependence of the current reflects the pH dependence of the ultimate steps in this pathway. It is possible that conformational changes that do not belong to these ultimate steps have a different pH dependence. The pH<sub>50</sub> values depend on the two ends of the scale, the most alkaline pH at which a ΔF signal or a current is detected, and the pH at which its increase saturates. ΔF signals appear to saturate in many mutants at less acidic pH than the current. The observed alkaline shift in the pH dependence of fluorescence is reminiscent of the hyperpolarization shift of the fluorescence relative to the current voltage dependence of K<sup>+</sup> channels (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Mannuzzu et al., 1996</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Cha and Bezanilla, 1997</xref>).

These rearrangements are accompanied by a displacement of the β-turns. The collapse of the central vestibule continues during the open-desensitized transition.

The generally slow conformational changes in the palm further support the tight link between the palm and desensitization, adding to the previously demonstrated importance of the β1-β2 linker in determining the desensitization kinetics (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Coric et al., 2003</xref>), the established role of the β11-β12 linker with whom the β1-β2 linker tightly interacts (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib44">Springauf et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib41">Rook et al., 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Baconguis and Gouaux, 2012</xref>), as well as the importance of the lower palm β strands (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib42">Roy et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib51">Wu et al., 2019</xref>) in desensitization. The approaching of 'D357 to β1-β2 linker residues may be related to slow conformational changes in the acidic pocket, which are not predicted from the structure comparison, for which there is however strong evidence from VCF experiments (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib48">Vullo et al., 2017</xref>).</p></sec><sec id="s3-6"><title>ASIC pH sensing and signaling toward the gate</title><p>Mutations of titratable residues in the palm, wrist and acidic pocket affect the pH dependence of ASICs, and although crystal structures predict an important role of the acidic pocket in ASIC activation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Jasti et al., 2007</xref>), it was shown that pH sensing in the acidic pocket is not required for the generation of transient H<sup>+</sup>-induced ASIC currents (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib48">Vullo et al., 2017</xref>). In the lower palm, putative pH-sensing residues were identified in several β strands (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Liechti et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Krauson et al., 2013</xref>). Mutation of the wrist residue His73 to Ala shifted the pH dependence of activation to more acidic values, and simultaneous mutation of His72 and His73 to Asn suppressed pH-induced currents completely (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">Paukert et al., 2008</xref>).</p><p>We show here that activation-related conformational changes occur in the finger and in the acidic pocket. Such conformational changes can likely be transmitted down to the pore from the finger and acidic pocket via the thumb and the thumb-palm loops to the TM1 involving the interactions between aromatic residues of the TM1 and the β-turn, and/or via the central scaffold and subunit interactions to the palm and from there to the transmembrane domains (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8">Figure 8A</xref>). Protonation events in the palm and wrist would affect the transmission of conformational changes initiated farther up, or may drive in part the large conformational changes of these domains, which would – due to their proximity – also change the conformation of the transmembrane domains or affect the position of the β-turns. Mutation of the interacting residues between the β-turn and the TM1 disrupts ASIC1a currents (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Li et al., 2009</xref>), leading to a lowering of the cell surface expression, and rendering the cell surface-resident channels non-functional (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Jing et al., 2011</xref>). Normal mode analysis had suggested a high correlation between movements of the β-turn and the upper TM1 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib52">Yang et al., 2009</xref>), highlighting together with the experimental data a possible importance of the β-turn for ASIC activation.</p><p>In conclusion, we show here that upon extracellular acidification, fast conformational changes occur simultaneously in different ASIC domains, consistent with the existence of multiple protonation sites. Analysis of the kinetics and the direction of conformational changes in the palm and palm-thumb loops highlights rapid events in the palm-thumb loops, which may therefore constitute a preferred communication pathway between protonation sites and the channel gate in the context of activation.</p></sec></sec><sec id="s4" sec-type="materials|methods"><title>Materials and

All oocytes used for TEVC and VCF experiments had been previously labeled in the dark with 5 μM CF488 maleimide (Biotium) or AlexaFluor488 maleimide (ThermoFisher) at room temperature for 15 min. Oocytes were placed in a RC-26Z recording chamber (Warner Instruments) and impaled with glass electrodes filled with 1M KCl, and continuously perfused by gravity at a rate of 5–15 mL/min. A specially designed chamber was used to measure the kinetics of the fluorescence changes (ΔF) and current from about the same oocytes surface, as described previously (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib48">Vullo et al., 2017</xref>). In this chamber, the solution flows under the oocyte (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1C</xref>). Macroscopic currents were measured at a holding potential of −40 mV with a TEV-200A amplifier (Dagan Corporation). Data were recorded with Chartmaster software (HEKA Electronics) at a sampling rate of 1 kHz. Standard recording solutions contained (mM): 110 NaCl, 2 CaCl<sub>2</sub>, and 10 HEPES for pH ≥6.8. For solutions with a pH &lt;6.8, HEPES was replaced by 10 mM MES. The pH was adjusted using NaOH and HCl. For the current and ΔF measurements, channels were stimulated once every minute for 10 s (20 s for pH dependence measurements of ΔF).</p><p>The speed of solution change in the area used for the measurement of the fluorescence and the current signal of the chamber used for the kinetic measurements was determined by the same approach as described previously for a different chamber (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Bonifacio et al., 2014</xref>). The constitutively active, Na<sup>+</sup>-selective ENaC was expressed in oocytes, and oocytes were labeled before the experiment with the membrane-impermeable, pH-sensitive fluorophore 5 (6) FAM SE [5-(and-6)-carboxyfluorescein, succinimidyl ester] mixed isomers (Biotium, Chemie Brunschwig, Basel, Switzerland). In the experiments, the solution was changed from one containing K<sup>+</sup> as cation, at pH7.4 to one in which K<sup>+</sup> was replaced by Na<sup>+</sup>, and whose pH was 6.0. This allowed the simultaneous determination of the solution change by fluorescence and by current measurement without the involvement of a channel activation, since ENaC is constitutively active, but not permeable to K<sup>+</sup>. The rise time (RT) of the solution change was 355 ± 37 ms (current) and 296 ± 34 ms (ΔF), and the ratio RTΔF/RTI was 0.85 ± 0.07 (n = 8). These kinetics are slower than the current and ΔF measured for ASIC activation by pH in many experiments. It is known from experiments with ultrarapid perfusion systems and excised patches that the intrinsic kinetics of ASIC activation are of the order of ~10 ms (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Bässler et al., 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib46">Sutherland et al., 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Alijevic et al., 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib47">Vaithia et al., 2019</xref>). Therefore, the ASIC activation kinetics are in most studies limited by the speed of the perfusion change. Our control experiments indicate that in experiments with ASICs, the current and ΔF maximum was reached before the solution change was complete, indicating that the peak was reached at a lower H<sup>+</sup> concentration than the one of the acidic solutions. Therefore, the actual acidic pH of the kinetic measurements is more alkaline than the pH of the acidic solution. Since in our experiments, relative differences between current and ΔF kinetics, measured simultaneously, are analyzed, the conclusions about the speed of the ΔF relative to the current signal, and with this the attribution to a given functional transition, is valid. It needs however to be taken into account that the absolute speed of these kinetics is limited by the kinetics of the solution change, and that the actual pH of the measurement of the kinetics is slightly more alkaline than that of the test solution.</p></sec><sec id="s4-4"><title>Fluorescence measurements</title><p>The VCF setup was equipped with an Intensilight mercury lamp (C-HGFI; Nikon) and a 40x Nikon oil-immersion objective to detect the fluorescence signal emitted by fluorophore-labeled oocytes. The optical signal was then converted into current units by a photodiode (S1336-18BQ; Hamamatsu Photonics) coupled to the head stage of an amplifier (List-EPC-7; HEKA). A low-pass eight-pole Bessel filter was used to amplify and filter the signal at 50 Hz. Changes in fluorescence intensity (ΔF) were normalized to the total fluorescence signal (F). Specificity of the fluorescence signals was assessed by exposing the oocytes to a slightly acidic pH (pH6.7) for 50 s, which puts the channels in the desensitized state, before they were stimulated with pH6. This protocol did not generate ionic current, because the channels were desensitized before the acidification to pH6. If a Cys mutant showed a substantial fluorescence signal after application of this protocol, the signal was considered as potentially non-specific. It can, however, not be excluded that such a signal may be due to a transition between different sub-states, as for example two desensitized states. As a measure of the specificity of the signal (or a component of the signal), the ratio of the ΔF/F induced by acidification from the desensitized relative to the ΔF/F induced by acidification from the closed state was calculated (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="supp3">Supplementary file 3</xref>).

ΔF and current kinetics were considered as correlated for a given mutant and pH condition if the steepness of the linear regression of a plot of the rise time (as time to pass from 10 to 90% of the full amplitude) of ΔF as a function of the rise time of the current kinetics was between 0.75 and 1.33.

The traces in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1G</xref> show modeled ΔF traces for the case that ΔF was associated to one single functional state, or associated to either the activation or sensitization gate. The model assumes that fluorescence can be positively or negatively associated with any of the four states. We aimed to use the simplest model (least number of non-zero factors) that described the measured ΔF sufficiently well. For ease of interpretation, we included an F(C) different from 0 only if the trace could not be described with attributing values to F(C), F(O) and/or F(CD) alone. For the large majority of ΔF traces it was possible to find combinations of scaling factors that reproduced the experimental trace reasonably well (see for example <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1D</xref>). The values of F(C), F(O), F(CD), and F(OD) describing each model are noted in blue below the simulated traces, and are presented in <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="supp2">Supplementary file 2</xref>. These factors were estimated empirically as follows. For some recurring, relatively simple patterns of the ΔF signal, defined rules were used to derive the factors. Simple transient signals containing in addition a sustained component (e.g. E63C) were characterized by a F(O) and F(OD). F(O) was set equal to −1 or +1 depending on the polarity of the ΔF signal, and F(OD) was chosen to reproduce the quantitatively determined ΔF<sub>sust</sub>/ΔF<sub>peak</sub> ratio. Many of the measured ΔF signals were sustained, without transient component (e.g. K105C). Simulations with the kinetic model showed that the kinetics of the ΔF onset depend almost exclusively on F(O) and F(OD). The absolute value of F(OD), (abs(F(OD))) needs to be &gt; abs(F(O)) to ensure that there is no transient component. F(OD) was set to −1 or +1 in these cases, and F(O) was based on experimentally determined kinetics at pH6.0 of the RT of the fluorescence onset (RTF) relative to the current rise time (current activation, RTAI) and the current decay time (current desensitization, RTDI) as (RTF-RTAI)/(RTDI-RTAI). This ratio was also determined with the kinetic model for a number of values of F(O), and a function relating F(O) to the (RTF-RTAI)/(RTDI-RTAI) ratio was derived from the model, and used to calculate F(O) for each mutant showing a simple sustained signal (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="supp2">Supplementary file 2</xref>, Model parameters).</p><p>For acidification from pH7.4 to pH6.0, the P(CD) is ~0 during the acidification and increases immediately upon returning to pH7.4, and decreases then slowly. This slow decrease is related to the recovery from desensitization. A slow decay of the ΔF signal upon returning to pH7.4 was observed in many mutants, as for example S83C (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4B</xref>). In some cases, only a part of the decay is slow (I428C, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2B</xref>). If abs(F(CD)) &gt; abs(F(OD)), a partially sustained ΔF signal increases transiently upon returning to pH7.4 (e.g. Y71C, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2B</xref>). F(O) and F(OD) do not influence the ‘off’ kinetics of the ΔF signals. To obtain values of F(CD) for each mutant, the experimental ‘off’ kinetics of the ΔF signal of each mutant were measured for the pH6.0-pH7.4 transition (RTF<sub>off</sub>, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="supp1">Supplementary file 1</xref>). These kinetics were also determined for a model with F(OD)=1 and different values of F(CD), and the relationship in the model between F(CD) and RTF<sub>off</sub> was determined. If abs(F(OD))&lt;1, the F(CD)/F(OD) ratio determined the ‘off’ kinetics (i.e. the RTF<sub>off</sub> in the model F(OD)=1, F(CD)=1 was equal to that of F(OD)=0.5, F(CD)=0.5). The relationship between F(CD) and RTF<sub>off</sub> determined in the model was then used to calculate F(CD) from the experimental RTF<sub>off</sub> for each mutant (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="supp2">Supplementary file 2</xref>).</p></sec></sec></body><back><ack id="ack"><title>Acknowledgements</title><p>The authors thank Ivan Gautschi for expert experimental work, and Anand Vaithia and Zhong Peng for their comments on a previous version of the manuscript.

ASIC1a channels are beginning to be unraveled. This paper by Vullo et al., present elegant experiments that provide a framework to understand how the interaction of protons at distant sites are transmitted and converted to the opening of the pore in these channels. The authors have carried out simultaneous recordings of channel activity and conformational changes and rationalized their results in a comprehensive model of channel gating. This is a relevant work that extends the understanding of these channels, which participate in important physiological and pathophysiological processes such as pain and noxious stimuli perception.</p><p><bold>Decision letter after peer review:</bold></p><p>[Editors’ note: the authors submitted for reconsideration following the decision after peer review. What follows is the decision letter after the first round of review.]</p><p>Thank you for submitting your work entitled &quot;Kinetic analysis of ASIC1a delineates conformational signaling from proton-sensing domains to the channel gate&quot; for consideration by <italic>eLife</italic>. Your article has been reviewed by three peer reviewers including Leon D Islas as the Reviewing Editor and Reviewer #1, and the evaluation has been overseen by a Senior Editor. The following individuals involved in review of your submission have agreed to reveal their identity: John Bankston (Reviewer #2); John B Cowgill (Reviewer #3).</p><p>Our decision has been reached after consultation between the reviewers. Based on these discussions and the individual reviews below, we regret to inform you that your work will not be considered further for publication in <italic>eLife</italic>.</p><p>The reviewers considered this an interesting manuscript and were impressed by the large amount of work presented; however, it is the consensus that the depth of analysis is lacking and the interpretation needs to be reconsidered in the light of a more careful analysis. In particular, the sequence of the proposed conformational wave is a weak point that needs to be reinterpreted given the difficulty in assigning particular states based on fluorescence changes. We believe the required changes are substantial and require more time that allowed by <italic>eLife</italic>. If you decide to thoroughly address the reviewers comments, we will be willing to receive a new submission.</p><p><italic>Reviewer #1:</italic></p><p>The authors of this manuscript have carried out an extensive mapping of fluorescence changes associated with ASIC channel activation by pH changes. Through reaction of fluorophores at strategically introduced cysteine residues, fluorescence signals in response to rapid solution changes were recorded that had different kinetics.

However, the main problem I see with this manuscript in its current form is that the different kinetic behaviors of fluorescence signals cannot be unequivocally assigned to specific channel states or gating transitions.</p><p>For example, fast fluorescence changes with the kinetics of channel opening do not necessarily mean they are associated with opening.

This observation could also happen if fluorescence arises form desensitization coupled to channel opening. Separating closed-state desensitization from opening is not easy, but the authors should at least discuss these possibilities.</p><p>Also, please indicate if, as expected, current and fluorescence kinetics become faster with lower pH.</p><p>The observation that Tyr417 quenches the fluorescence of the Alexa dyes, leads the authors to the Trp quenching experiments. Please explain the rational for using Trp and not Tyr. One would expect that the bulkier, more hydrophobic Trp could potentially produce larger, unspecific, structural perturbations.</p><p>In subsection “The β1- β2 linker and the β5- β6 loop approach each other before desensitization”, it is argued that the fluorophores positioned at some mutants could produce signals as a result of protonation of the dyes. This argument can be applied to dyes introduced in all positions studied here. Please show control experiments indicating the ph-dependence of the fluorescence of a dye introduced in a non-dynamic position.</p><p>Related to this issue, for position in which the Alexa was paired with Trp, please show, as a control, the fluorescence of these modified positions in the absence of Trp. Presumably there is no fluorescence change in the absence of the quencher that can confound the interpretation of these experiments (Figures 3 and Figure 4).</p><p><italic>Reviewer #2:</italic></p><p>In this manuscript, Vullo and colleagues use VCF to look at conformational changes in many different regions of the extracellular domain of ASIC1a in order to determine which regions of the channel may be involved in pH sensing versus gate opening and to determine the directionality of a number of these conformational changes. The experiments are, overall, well executed and the data are high quality, but there are a number of issues with the analysis and interpretation that lessen my enthusiasm for the work. My specific concerns are listed below</p><p>1) Overall there is an enormous amount of data here and each figure could almost be expanded into its own more detailed paper. In the end, I think there needs to be a more thorough analysis and discussion of this data in order to understand what the take home messages might be. There is a lot of nuance in almost each labelled position, and many are just not discussed at all and I think the conclusions drawn by the authors are overly simple compared to the complexity of the data. I will just give a few examples below, but this problem persists throughout.</p><p>2) Figure 1 is used to conclude that &quot;fast conformational changes occur simultaneously in different ASIC domains, consistent with the existence of multiple protonation sites.&quot; It is almost certainly true that lots of sites on the channel are protonated, but it’s not clear if these conformational changes are related to a conformational change that is actually associated with pH sensing and/or gating. For a few examples, T419C F rise time matches the rise time of the current rise time (Figure 1D), but the pH0.5 of the current is ~6.5 while the pH0.5 of the F is more like 6. So at pH 6 half the channels have undergone this conformational change as measured by F, but all of the channels are open. So it’s not clear to me, what this pH dependent conformational change represents. Then if you look at E63 the pH0.5 of the F is close to the pHDes0.5 and more alkaline that the pH0.5 of the current but no discussion of these data is given. The F signal might be alkaline relative to the current because ASICs are trimers and 3 subunits must undergo the conformational change at this site before the channel opens. This is analagous to the movement of 4 voltage sensing particles in the Hodgkin Huxley model which requires that the F curves in these channels be raised to the fourth power to match the current. Or maybe the conformational change is related to the entry into desensitization. But this sort of examination of the data is almost totally missing from the paper.</p><p>3) As another example, in Figure 3, A81C/Y417V/P205W and A81/Y417/M210 shows an increase in F suggesting A81 is moving away from P205 and M210. But then A81, S83 and Q84 are moving closer to 205, 205, and 209 in every other case. While this may all be true and some of the differences might be simply explained by a change or flip in rotameric position of the side chains, I think the analysis done here and the Discussion is not detailed enough to create a clear picture of what is happening at each of the regions of the channel. This is made clear in the model Figure in 5B and C in which the loop, where S83 is, is somehow simultaneously moving in opposite directions. Perhaps molecular dynamics simulations using some of the constraints from the data could help pull together a picture from this amount of data, but as it stands it’s just hard to understand the overall conclusions.</p><p>4) Not every mutant has a pH0.5 measurement. S83 alone shifts the pH0.5 to about 6 such that the channel is only half activated at the pH they use through much of the paper. Meanwhile, WT is probably 75% activated at pH 6 and A81 is 100% activated. It makes interpreting the data challenging. And if for some reason these triple mutants had larger effects on pH dependence it would even further complicate the interpretation.</p><p><italic>Reviewer #3:</italic></p><p>ASICs are pH sensing ion channels that have garnered interest as potential targets for treatments of a wide variety of physiological disorders and diseases. Structures are available for the channel putatively in all three observable functional states of ASICs. These highlight the structural changes that must occur during a gating cycle, but as of now, the kinetics of the various structural changes have not been established. Vullo et al., use VCF to correlate the conformational changes in various regions of the ASIC extracellular domain to functional changes during channel gating to establish an understanding of the order of events leading to channel opening then desensitization. Furthermore, they utilize fluorophore-quencher pairs to establish directionality to conformational changes. Overall, the manuscript is well written, and the experiments are expertly conducted, and these findings should help the field better understand ASIC channel gating. I have only a few concerns which I have listed below:</p><p>The plots with the split y-axes are very difficult to interpret. Perhaps the authors could instead plot the y-axis on the log scale so that it is easier to accommodate all the data on a single plot. Log time scales are probably more appropriate for viewing time constants, which would be analogous to the RT used here, anyway. As it is, Figure 1D, Figure 3C, Figure 4C, Figure 1—figure supplement 1A,B, Figure 3—figure supplement 2B, and Figure 4—figure supplement 1A,B are not legible.</p><p>In the subsection &quot;Fast conformational changes in ASIC domains that are distant from pore,&quot; fluorescence changes observed are attributed to movements of the labeled site. Later authors show that (at least in some cases) it is movement relative to a quencher group located elsewhere in the channel that causes fluorescence change (subsection “The β1- β2 linker and the β5- β6 loop approach each other before desensitization”). And others, the movement is attributed to the quencher and not the fluorophore (subsection “Detection of fast conformational changes in palm-thumb loops”). It might be helpful to add to the limitations section a brief discussion about uncertainty regarding whether it is the fluorophore or quencher moving. Additionally, it would be helpful if the authors included the distance range where fluorophore-quencher pairs are sensitive to movement.</p><p>An additional limitation for VCF that is mentioned in subsection “Slow approaching between the palm β1-β2 linker and β12 strand” that is not mentioned in the Discussion is that a change in orientation could produce a fluorescence change without change in distance.</p><p>Studies on kinetics of ligand-gated processes are generally restricted by the rate of solution exchange of the setup. This study somewhat gets around the issue because authors are comparing rate of the fluorescence changes relative to changes in current amplitude that is measured simultaneously. It would be helpful to have the approximate rate of solution exchange provided to compare with the kinetics of the changes in current or fluorescence.</p><p>Fluorescence changes observed using pH jump from 6.7 to 6 are deemed non-specific. Is there any evidence that there are not structural changes occurring during this change other than the lack of currents elicited? Is it possible there are multiple desensitized states and this stimulus just causes change from one desensitized state to another? The attribution of nonspecific components in the change in fluorescence to protonation of the fluorophore seems less plausible given it is not widely observed but only occurs in a couple mutants. I think the use of this protocol is a very nice control but may not completely eliminate specific signals.</p><p>[Editors’ note: further revisions were suggested prior to acceptance, as described below.]</p><p>Thank you for submitting your article &quot;Kinetic analysis of ASIC1a delineates conformational signaling from proton-sensing domains to the channel gate&quot; for consideration by <italic>eLife</italic>. Your article has been reviewed by four peer reviewers including Leon D Islas as the Reviewing Editor and Reviewer #1, and the evaluation has been overseen by Kenton Swartz as the Senior Editor. The following individuals involved in review of your submission have agreed to reveal their identity: John Bankston (Reviewer #2); John B Cowgill (Reviewer #3).</p><p>The reviewers have discussed their reviews with one another, and the Reviewing Editor has drafted this to help you prepare a revised submission.</p><p>Summary:</p><p>In this work, the authors propose an allosteric pathway for the activation of ASIC channels by pH. These channels are important substrates for disease and pharmacological targets. The authors use a combination of electrophysiology and fluorescence measurements to trace conformational changes in the channel protein. The main result is that pH-dependent changes occur in several extracellular proton-binding sites that converge on the final opening gating step. This work provides a large amount of valuable data for scientists interested in how ASIC channel gating might work. In addition, it provides a number of testable hypotheses about conformational changes that occur in the various domains of ASIC1a.</p><p>The authors have made several changes and improvements to the manuscript, in particular, the inclusion of a gating model helps the interpretation of experimental results in a coherent framework.</p><p>Essential Revisions:</p><p>1) The reviewers agree that the new MD calculations do not help support the conclusions. In particular, steered MD cannot be used as in this version of the manuscript to validate experimental results. Since the MD protocol is not unbiased, it seems the expected conformation change will always be warranted to occur. Please see the individual reviewers’ comments.</p><p>2) The consensus of the reviewers’ discussions is that the MD results do not help the manuscript, are largely arbitrary and should be removed unless substantially different MD protocols can be applied.</p><p><italic>Reviewer #1 (Recommendations for the authors):</italic></p><p>Regarding the SMD simulations.</p><p>I find it a little backwards when the author uses MD to validate an experimental result. It is usually the other way around, a simulation suggests a (theoretical) conformational change and it’s validated by experiment.</p><p>Although suggestive, the use of SMD is not well justified in the context that it is presented in the manuscript, as a validation of the conformational change. It seems to me that the criteria used in this simulation is not robust enough, why use a criterion of reaching a target distance in 40 ns ? How is the cut-off of 2.2 A justified?</p><p>SMD will by necessity produce a change in the direction in which the desired force is applied, so it seems that additional criteria should be used for its results to be taken as a validation of a conformational change suggested in experimental results.</p><p>Regarding Figures.</p><p>The schemes presented in Figure 5—figure supplement 2 and Figure 6—figure supplement 1 should be improved. A movie or animation should be used to summarize all this data. In the current figures, the conformational changes implied by the arrows are difficult to discern in a static picture. The authors should consider improving or eliminating them altogether.</p><p><italic>Reviewer #2 (Recommendations for the authors):</italic></p><p>While I still have concerns, the authors have added new data and tried to provide more framework for understanding this large volume of work. They have discussed the potential limitations in the discussion and tempered some of the conclusions. I don't have any additional suggestions for this manuscript.</p><p><italic>Reviewer #3 (Recommendations for the authors):</italic></p><p>If the protonation states were assigned assuming a pH of 5.3 as in the previous publication, I think this needs to be clarified in both the Results and the Materials and methods. If the protonation states were assigned assuming a pH of ~7, I think the simulations would need to be repeated at low pH. Indeed, any differences in the SMD for these pairs observed between the pH 5.3 and 7 condition could be informative,</p><p><italic>Reviewer #4 (Recommendations for the authors):</italic></p><p>The protocol used for the steered MD simulations is largely arbitrary:</p><p>how can one be sure that the length of the simulation is sufficient to observe the displacement? How about the force constant for the bias?</p><p>Is there any quantitative criterion that can be invoked to gauge the strength of this bias potential?</p><p>More fundamentally: since one is biasing the distance, what kind of conclusion can one draw based on the fact that the target has been reached? In other words: isn't it tautological that if I bias a distance then that distance change?</p><p>The authors should consider these concerns and make an effort to redesign (or at least provide some reasoning for) the computational protocol.</p></body></sub-article><sub-article article-type="reply" id="sa2"><front-stub><article-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.66488.sa2</article-id><title-group><article-title>Author response</article-title></title-group></front-stub><body><p>[Editors’ note: the authors resubmitted a revised version of the paper for consideration.

In the revised manuscript we have determined from the kinetic model what the properties of a fluorescence signal that is associated with the desensitized state would be. The kinetic model used is based on the Hodgkin-Huxley formalism and contains therefore two desensitized states, CD (closed-desensitized) and OD (open-desensitized). The model predicts that a fluorescence signal associated with the CD state would have a bell-shaped pH dependence with a maximum at <italic>~</italic>pH6.8. The experimental determination of the pH dependence of fluorescence signals showed however an increase with acidic pH and then a saturation. If the two desensitized states are lumped together, the pH dependence shows a saturation (thus no bell-shaped curve), however the kinetics are those of the transition from the open to the desensitized state, and clearly slower than the kinetics of channel opening, indicating that rapid fluorescence changes are not associated with the desensitized state.</p><p>This is presented in Figure 3 and discussed in the text.</p><p>Regarding our statement on the pH-independence of the ratios of fluorescence to current, we agree with Dr. Islas that this is not at all a proof for a close association with opening, and we have removed this statement.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Also, please indicate if, as expected, current and fluorescence kinetics become faster with lower pH.</p></disp-quote><p>We observe this acceleration. In the manuscript we present the data at different pH values, however not in all cases side by side. A side-by-side comparison of fluorescence kinetics at three pH values of wrist mutants is for example shown in Figure 3D, confirming such a pH dependence. For the current, it is expected that the current appearance, but not the current decay is accelerated with acidic pH. This is for example shown in Figure 4D for three mutants of the palm.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>The observation that Tyr417 quenches the fluorescence of the Alexa dyes, leads the authors to the Trp quenching experiments. Please explain the rational for using Trp and not Tyr. One would expect that the bulkier, more hydrophobic Trp could potentially produce larger, unspecific, structural perturbations.</p></disp-quote><p>We agree with Dr. Islas that Tyr would be a more conservative choice with less risk of structural interference. Trp is a stronger quencher, and it is for this reason that we have chosen to use Trp. A possible drawback is that the function of such mutants is different from the WT. All triple mutants except two mutants described in Figure 5</p><p>(A81C/Y417C/T209W, A81C/Y417C/M210W) showed an ASIC-typical transient current. The pH dependence of desensitization was generally not affected, while there was some variability in the pH dependence of activation. All mutants except for S83C/Y417V/D357W expressed big currents. Together, this indicates that the function of the mutants was quite close to that of the wild type. Since we compare current and fluorescence signal properties directly at the same pH, and carry out this analysis at three pH values, the shifts in pH dependence should not affect the conclusions. We discuss these aspects in subsection &quot;Association of <italic>D</italic>F signals with functional transitions&quot;.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>In subsection “The β1- β2 linker and the β5- β6 loop approach each other before desensitization”, it is argued that the fluorophores positioned at some mutants could produce signals as a result of protonation of the dyes. This argument can be applied to dyes introduced in all positions studied here. Please show control experiments indicating the ph-dependence of the fluorescence of a dye introduced in a non-dynamic position.</p></disp-quote><p>The fluorophores used in this study are indicated as being &quot;intrinsically pH-independent&quot;. We observe with both fluorophores in many mutants that we have tested no fluorescence change at all. Such mutants are then not further used, because no information can be extracted. In some of them, the engineered Cys may not be accessible, in others however the pH change does probably not change enough the environment, which would explain the lack of fluorescence change. In the present study we observed big fluorescence signals with the single mutants A81C, S83C and Q84C (Figure 4 of the new manuscript). If on the background of each of these mutants Tyr417 was mutated to Val, the fluorescence signal disappeared almost completely. The Y417V mutation does not affect the reaction of the fluorophore derivative with the engineered Cys residues at positions 81, 83 and 84, but changed dramatically the fluorescence signal. This indicates therefore that the fluorophores have been attached, but that only a very small fluorescence change is recorded. If the fluorescence change was due to a pH effect on the fluorophore, it would not be affected by the mutation of Tyr417. We have carried out control protocols to estimate the specificity of the fluorescence signals for each mutant (Supplementary file 3) that are also discussed in the response to one of the points raised by Dr. Cowgill.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Related to this issue, for position in which the Alexa was paired with Trp, please show, as a control, the fluorescence of these modified positions in the absence of Trp. Presumably there is no fluorescence change in the absence of the quencher that can confound the interpretation of these experiments (Figure 3 and Figure 4).</p></disp-quote><p>These controls are those discussed above, which are described in the revised manuscript in Figure 4.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Reviewer #2:</p><p>1) Overall there is an enormous amount of data here and each figure could almost be expanded into its own more detailed paper. In the end, I think there needs to be a more thorough analysis and discussion of this data in order to understand what the take home messages might be. There is a lot of nuance in almost each labelled position, and many are just not discussed at all and I think the conclusions drawn by the authors are overly simple compared to the complexity of the data. I will just give a few examples below, but this problem persists throughout.</p></disp-quote><p>For this new version of the manuscript, the analysis has been refined and completed. We will discuss this in the specific points raised below. We would like to stress here also that the fact that many residues are analyzed is also a strength of this study. Our conclusions are not based on only a limited number of mutants, but they rely on a large data sample. The extension of the analysis in the new manuscript leads to clearer conclusions.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>2) Figure 1 is used to conclude that &quot;fast conformational changes occur simultaneously in different ASIC domains, consistent with the existence of multiple protonation sites.&quot; It is almost certainly true that lots of sites on the channel are protonated, but it’s not clear if these conformational changes are related to a conformational change that is actually associated with pH sensing and/or gating. For a few examples, T419C F rise time matches the rise time of the current rise time (Figure 1D), but the pH0.5 of the current is ~6.5 while the pH0.5 of the F is more like 6. So at pH 6 half the channels have undergone this conformational change as measured by F, but all of the channels are open. So it’s not clear to me, what this pH dependent conformational change represents. Then if you look at E63 the pH0.5 of the F is close to the pHDes0.5 and more alkaline that the pH0.5 of the current but no discussion of these data is given. The F signal might be alkaline relative to the current because ASICs are trimers and 3 subunits must undergo the conformational change at this site before the channel opens. This is analagous to the movement of 4 voltage sensing particles in the Hodgkin Huxley model which requires that the F curves in these channels be raised to the fourth power to match the current. Or maybe the conformational change is related to the entry into desensitization. But this sort of examination of the data is almost totally missing from the paper.</p></disp-quote><p>As indicated, there is in most mutants a shift between the pH dependence of the current and of that of the fluorescence signal, that has already been shown in other studies. The origin of this shift is not understood. However, it is highly likely that in ASICs, as in other ion channels, conformational changes in different parts of the channel will eventually lead to the opening of the channel pore. The pH dependence of the current reflects the pH dependence of the ultimate steps in this pathway. It is well possible that conformational changes that do not belong to these ultimate steps have a different pH dependence. For both mutants cited above, the kinetics of the fluorescence signal at a given pH change are however very close to the kinetics of current appearance. One of the mutants tested in our study, A81C/Y417C/T209W (Figure 5) does not desensitize at all, however its pH50 of fluorescence is shifted from the pH50 of current activation similarly as other mutants. This further shows that the alkaline shift of the pH dependence of fluorescence does not indicate an association with desensitization. The pH50 value depends on the two end points of the curve, thus the least acidic pH where a signal (fluorescence or current) is measured on one end, and the more acidic pH where saturation of the signal increase occurs on the other end. Clearly, saturation occurs at less acidic pH for fluorescence signals than currents. The observed alkaline shift in the pH dependence of fluorescence is reminiscent of the hyperpolarization shift of the fluorescence relative to the voltage dependence of K channels (Manuzzu, 1996). A divergence of the concentration dependence between the deltaF signals and the current was also observed for other ligand-gated channels for fluorescence signals associated with activation, as for example in Dahan, 2004 and Pless and Lynch, 2009. We agree with Dr. Bankston that this discrepancy in the pH dependence needs to be better discussed. In the revised manuscript, we provide the pH dependence of almost all mutants, we plot the difference in pH50 (pH50(<italic>D</italic>F)-pH50(current activation)) as a function of the <italic>D</italic>F kinetics in Figure 6—figure supplement 4, and we discuss these shifts in subsection &quot;Dissociation of <italic>D</italic>F and current pH dependence&quot;.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>3) As another example, in Figure 3, A81C/Y417V/P205W and A81/Y417/M210 shows an increase in F suggesting A81 is moving away from P205 and M210. But then A81, S83 and Q84 are moving closer to 205, 205, and 209 in every other case. While this may all be true and some of the differences might be simply explained by a change or flip in rotameric position of the side chains, I think the analysis done here and the discussion is not detailed enough to create a clear picture of what is happening at each of the regions of the channel. This is made clear in the model Figure in 5B and C in which the loop, where S83 is, is somehow simultaneously moving in opposite directions. Perhaps molecular dynamics simulations using some of the constraints from the data could help pull together a picture from this amount of data, but as it stands it’s just hard to understand the overall conclusions.</p></disp-quote><p>As indicated by Dr. Bankston, some VCF-predicted distance changes contradict each other, and it is difficult to determine which of them are more reliable than others. We have now carried out two MD simulations, one for <italic>D</italic>F signals correlated with the closedopen, and one for signals correlated with the open-desensitized transitions. In these simulations we applied constraints that were based on the VCF data: For residue pairs predicted to approach each other, we applied harmonic forces to reduce their distance by 5 Å, and for those predicted to move away from each other, we applied forces to increase their distance. In such steered MD simulations, the applied force will decrease once the target distance is approached. At the end of the simulation, we thus measured the remaining difference to the target distance and the force that was still applied. By posing a threshold, we could thus select between distance changes that are likely to occur, and such that seem less probable. We used the MD simulations also to interpret seemingly contradicting predictions of the VCF experiments. Based on this additional analysis, the presentation and interpretation of the structural conclusions of the VCF data has been changed, as shown in Figure 7, Figure 8 and Figure 9 of the revised manuscript.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>4) Not every mutant has a pH0.5 measurement. S83 alone shifts the pH0.5 to about 6 such that the channel is only half activated at the pH they use through much of the paper. Meanwhile, WT is probably 75% activated at pH 6 and A81 is 100% activated. It makes interpreting the data challenging. And if for some reason these triple mutants had larger effects on pH dependence it would even further complicate the interpretation.</p></disp-quote><p>We provide for large majority of mutants kinetic analyses at three pH conditions, pH6.5, 6.0 and 5.5. In the revised manuscript, we provide also, the pH dependence for most of the triple mutants. The fact that we did not do all the measurements is due to circumstantial reasons, since one student is no longer working in the laboratory, and the person who took over had to undergo a major surgery. The additional dataset (Figure 6—figure supplement 3) shows that, for the large majority of triple mutants the pH50 of current activation was between 5.5 and 6.3. The kinetics of the <italic>D</italic>F signal relative to the current signal do not much change between pH6.0 and 5.5. Therefore, these shifts in pH dependence should not affect the conclusions. The triple mutants that showed a large acidic shift in the pH dependence of activation are A81C/Y417V/T209W and S83C/Y417V/D357W. The first of these mutants has a sustained current and slow kinetics and was for these reasons not considered for any structural interpretation. In the mutant S83C/Y417V/D357W, the kinetics of the fluorescence signal were at pH6.0 and 5.5 very close to those of desensitization (at pH6.5, no current was measured).</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Reviewer #3:</p><p>ASICs are pH sensing ion channels that have garnered interest as potential targets for treatments of a wide variety of physiological disorders and diseases. Structures are available for the channel putatively in all three observable functional states of ASICs. These highlight the structural changes that must occur during a gating cycle, but as of now, the kinetics of the various structural changes have not been established. Vullo et al., use VCF to correlate the conformational changes in various regions of the ASIC extracellular domain to functional changes during channel gating to establish an understanding of the order of events leading to channel opening then desensitization. Furthermore, they utilize fluorophore-quencher pairs to establish directionality to conformational changes. Overall, the manuscript is well written, and the experiments are expertly conducted, and these findings should help the field better understand ASIC channel gating. I have only a few concerns which I have listed below:</p><p>The plots with the split y-axes are very difficult to interpret. Perhaps the authors could instead plot the y-axis on the log scale so that it is easier to accommodate all the data on a single plot. Log time scales are probably more appropriate for viewing time constants, which would be analogous to the RT used here, anyway. As it is, Figure 1D, Figure 3C, Figure 4C, Figure 1—figure supplement 1A,B, Figure 3—figure supplement 2B, and Figure 4—figure supplement 1A ,B are not legible.</p><p>In the subsection &quot;Fast conformational changes in ASIC domains that are distant from pore,&quot; fluorescence changes observed are attributed to movements of the labeled site. Later authors show that (at least in some cases) it is movement relative to a quencher group located elsewhere in the channel that causes fluorescence change (subsection “The β1- β2 linker and the β5- β6 loop approach each other before desensitization”). And others, the movement is attributed to the quencher and not the fluorophore (subsection “Detection of fast conformational changes in palm-thumb loops”). It might be helpful to add to the limitations section a brief discussion about uncertainty regarding whether it is the fluorophore or quencher moving. Additionally, it would be helpful if the authors included the distance range where fluorophore-quencher pairs are sensitive to movement.</p></disp-quote><p>The fact that VCF does not tell whether the quencher or the fluorophore moves is discussed in the revised manuscript in subsection &quot;Structural interpretation of VCF with fluorophore-quencher pairing&quot;. The distance range in which quenching between a fluorophore and a quencher such as Trp or Tyr occurs was in several studies estimated as ≤ 15 Å. This information is provided in the revised manuscript at the beginning of subsection &quot;Conformational changes in the <italic>β</italic>1- <italic>β</italic>2 linker and the <italic>β</italic>5-<italic>β</italic>6 linker precede desensitization&quot;. As indicated in the response to the other reviewers, we have carried out Molecular Dynamics simulations to help interpreting the VCF results and overcome some of its limitations.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>An additional limitation for VCF that is mentioned in subsection “Slow approaching between the palm β1-β2 linker and β12 strand” that is not mentioned in the Discussion is that a change in orientation could produce a fluorescence change without change in distance.</p></disp-quote><p>This aspect is also discussed in subsection &quot;Structural interpretation of VCF with fluorophore-quencher pairing&quot; of the revised manuscript. For some fluorophore-quencher pairs we have analyzed with the MD simulation whether the backbone distance between the residues, or only the side chain distance changes, providing thus an information that we could not deduce from the VCF analysis.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Studies on kinetics of ligand-gated processes are generally restricted by the rate of solution exchange of the setup. This study somewhat gets around the issue because authors are comparing rate of the fluorescence changes relative to changes in current amplitude that is measured simultaneously. It would be helpful to have the approximate rate of solution exchange provided to compare with the kinetics of the changes in current or fluorescence.</p></disp-quote><p>Dr. Islas also asked us to provide such information. We provide in the revised manuscript this information in the Materials and methods, and discuss its implication in subsection &quot;Structural interpretation of VCF with fluorophore-quencher pairing&quot;.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Fluorescence changes observed using pH jump from 6.7 to 6 are deemed non-specific. Is there any evidence that there are not structural changes occurring during this change other than the lack of currents elicited? Is it possible there are multiple desensitized states and this stimulus just causes change from one desensitized state to another? The attribution of nonspecific components in the change in fluorescence to protonation of the fluorophore seems less plausible given it is not widely observed but only occurs in a couple mutants. I think the use of this protocol is a very nice control, but may not completely eliminate specific signals.</p></disp-quote><p>We were not clear enough in the description of how we interpret this test protocol. If for a mutant no fluorescence change is measured when the pH is changed from 6.7 to 6, this test tells us that the measured signal under normal conditions (from an alkaline pH to pH6) is specific. If a signal is also observed with the pH change from 6.7 to 6, it indicates that the signal may be non-specific, but as you mention, it is possible that this signal reflects conformational changes occurring for example between different desensitized states. With the reorganization of the manuscript we have moved this part to the Materials and methods, and have reformulated the passage as &quot; Specificity of the fluorescence signals was assessed by exposing the oocytes to a slightly acidic pH (pH6.7) for 50s, which puts the channels in the desensitized state, before they were stimulated with pH6. This protocol did not generate ionic current, because the channels were desensitized before the acidification to pH6. If a Cys mutant showed a substantial fluorescence signal after application of this protocol, the signal was considered as potentially non-specific. It can however not be excluded that such a signal may be due to a transition between different sub-states, as for example two desensitized states.&quot;</p><p>[Editors’ note: what follows is the authors’ response to the second round of review.]</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Essential Revisions:</p><p>1) The reviewers agree that the new MD calculations do not help support the conclusions.

To answer your specific questions, (1) regarding the cutoff of 2.2A: this value was chosen arbitrarily. However, about two thirds of the studied residue pairs fitted well in either one of two categories, those in which the distance and the force decreased, and those in which both parameters stayed elevated throughout the simulation. The cutoff of 2.2 A together with a cutoff for the remaining applied force separated these two populations well. (2), regarding the duration of the simulation: the simulations had a duration of 140 ns (closed-open transition) or 170ns (open-desensitized transition), because in all cases, convergence was obtained within this time. We recorded of all residue pairs the time course of the distance change. This showed that the main part of the distance change required only a few ns. The indication of 40 ns corresponded to the last 40 ns of a simulation, after reaching convergence.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>SMD will by necessity produce a change in the direction in which the desired force is applied, so it seems that additional criteria should be used for its results to be taken as a validation of a conformational change suggested in experimental results.</p></disp-quote><p>Although a force was applied to all involved residue pairs in these simulations, the expected changes in inter-residue distance occurred only in about half of them. This indicates that in such cases, the VCF-predicted conformational change is for structural reasons not possible.

We provide two animations, one for the closed-open, and one for the open-desensitized transition.

We concluded that the predicted movements in pairs in which the target was not reached are less likely to occur. Within the pairs for which the target was reached, some of the movements may correspond to those induced by protonation, while some may not, but are structurally possible.
