[8–12 Hz] oscillations with inhibitory functions: for instance, several studies showed that visual attention increases alpha-band power in the hemisphere ipsilateral to the attended location. However, other studies demonstrated that alpha oscillations positively correlate with visual perception, hinting at different processes underlying their dynamics. Here, using an approach based on traveling waves, we demonstrate that there are two functionally distinct alpha-band oscillations propagating in different directions. We analyzed EEG recordings from three datasets of human participants performing a covert visual attention task (one new dataset with <italic>N</italic> = 16, two previously published datasets with <italic>N</italic> = 16 and <italic>N</italic> = 31). Participants were instructed to detect a brief target by covertly attending to the screen’s left or right side. Our analysis reveals two distinct processes: allocating attention to one hemifield increases top-down alpha-band waves propagating from frontal to occipital regions ipsilateral to the attended location, both with and without visual stimulation. These top-down oscillatory waves correlate positively with alpha-band power in frontal and occipital regions. Yet, different alpha-band waves propagate from occipital to frontal regions and contralateral to the attended location. Crucially, these forward waves were present only during visual stimulation, suggesting a separate mechanism related to visual processing. Together, these results reveal two distinct processes reflected by different propagation directions, demonstrating the importance of considering oscillations as traveling waves when characterizing their functional role.</p></abstract><kwd-group kwd-group-type="author-keywords"><kwd>traveling waves</kwd><kwd>covert visual attention</kwd><kwd>alpha-band oscillations</kwd><kwd>EEG recordings</kwd><kwd>alpha lateralization</kwd></kwd-group><kwd-group kwd-group-type="research-organism"><title>Research organism</title><kwd>Human</kwd></kwd-group><funding-group><award-group id="fund1"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100000781</institution-id><institution>European Research Council</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>101075930</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Alamia</surname><given-names>Andrea</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund2"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100001665</institution-id><institution>Agence Nationale de la Recherche</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>ANR-19-PI3A-0004</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>VanRullen</surname><given-names>Rufin</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><funding-statement>The funders had no role in study design, data collection, and interpretation, or the decision to submit the work for publication.</funding-statement></funding-group><custom-meta-group><custom-meta specific-use="meta-only"><meta-name>Author impact statement</meta-name><meta-value>Covert visual attention modulates alpha-band traveling waves propagating from frontal to occipital regions in both hemispheres, yet it modulates waves propagating in the opposite direction (occipital to frontal) only in the presence of visual stimulation.</meta-value></custom-meta></custom-meta-group></article-meta></front><body><sec id="s1" sec-type="intro"><title>Introduction</title><p>Brain oscillations are related to several cognitive functions, as they orchestrate neuronal activity at distinct temporal and spatial scales (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Buzsáki and Draguhn, 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Buzsáki, 2009</xref>). Alpha-band oscillations [8–12 Hz] are the most prevailing rhythms in electrophysiological (EEG) recordings, spreading through most cortical regions.</p><p>Several studies investigated their functional role in various cognitive processes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">Palva and Palva, 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib40">Palva and Palva, 2011</xref>), providing mixed results. On the one hand, some studies showed that alpha-band oscillations might filter sensory information, regulating excitation and inhibition of sensory-specific brain regions (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Jensen and Mazaheri, 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Mathewson et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Klimesch, 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib44">Sadaghiani and Kleinschmidt, 2016</xref>). Accordingly, researchers interpreted alpha oscillations as a top-down mechanism involved in inhibitory control and timing of cortical processing (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Klimesch et al., 2007</xref>), as well as modulating cortical excitability (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Jensen and Mazaheri, 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Mathewson et al., 2011</xref>). Experimental studies corroborated this hypothesis, demonstrating how the phase of alpha-band oscillation affects visual perception (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Busch et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Fakche et al., 2022</xref>; but see also <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib43">Ruzzoli et al., 2019</xref>). Another highly replicated result regarding the inhibitory role of alpha oscillations consists in the hemispheric modulation in occipital regions associated with visual attention, having an increase of power ipsilateral to the attended hemifield, and a corresponding decrease contralaterally (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib60">Worden et al., 2000</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib45">Sauseng et al., 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Kelly et al., 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib54">Thut et al., 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Händel et al., 2011</xref>). On the other hand, other experimental studies have related alpha-band oscillations in occipital and parietal regions to perceptual processing and visual memory (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Bonnefond and Jensen, 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib57">VanRullen, 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib41">Pang et al., 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">Luo et al., 2021</xref>). For example, reverse-correlation techniques reveal that the visual system reverberates sensory information in the alpha-band for as long as 1 s, in what has been dubbed ‘perceptual echoes’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib56">VanRullen and Macdonald, 2012</xref>). Importantly, these echoes are a clear signature of sensory processing as they reflect the input’s precise time course, are modulated by attention and have been dissociated from inhibitory alpha power modulation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib56">VanRullen and Macdonald, 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib57">VanRullen, 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Brüers and VanRullen, 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib49">Schwenk et al., 2020</xref>).</p><p>Altogether, these experimental evidences support distinct and contradictory conclusions about alpha-band oscillation’s functional role(s), which remains an open debate. Here, we address this question from a different perspective that interprets alpha-band oscillations as traveling waves (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">Muller et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Alamia and VanRullen, 2019</xref>), thus considering their spatial component, and their propagation direction. Considering the case of visual attention, we tested the hypothesis that two functionally distinct alpha-band oscillations propagate along the frontal–occipital line in opposite directions. This compelling hypothesis about the different functional roles of alpha-band traveling waves derives from our previous studies (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Alamia and VanRullen, 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib41">Pang et al., 2020</xref>), in which we showed how visual perception modulates alpha waves, that is forward waves during visual stimulation, backward waves when the stimulus was off. In addition, this hypothesis is in line with previous studies suggesting that distinct alpha-band oscillations are related to specific cognitive processes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Gulbinaite et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Deng et al., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib48">Schuhmann et al., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib51">Sokoliuk et al., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Kasten et al., 2020</xref>). In this study, we analyzed three datasets, two publicly available (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Foster et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Feldmann-Wüstefeld and Vogel, 2019</xref>, see below), and one collected specifically for this study. In all datasets, participants attended either to the left or the right hemifield, while keeping central fixation. Our results confirmed the hemispheric modulation of alpha-band oscillations in posterior regions (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib60">Worden et al., 2000</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib45">Sauseng et al., 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Kelly et al., 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib54">Thut et al., 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Händel et al., 2011</xref>) and revealed two distinct alpha-band traveling waves propagating in opposite directions. First, visual attention increases top-down alpha-band waves propagating from frontal to occipital regions ipsilateral to the attended location, and such waves correlate positively with alpha power in frontal and occipital regions. Moreover, our analysis demonstrates that visual attention also modulates contralateral forward waves, that is, waves propagating from occipital to frontal areas. Importantly, the attentional modulation of forward waves is crucially dependent on sustained sensory processing, as this modulation disappears in the absence of visual stimulation. In contrast, alpha-band top-down waves are present and modulated by visual attention irrespective of the presence or absence of concurrent sensory stimulation. These results demonstrate two distinct alpha-band oscillatory waves propagating in opposite directions, seemingly underlying different cognitive processes. The well-known lateralization effect observed in alpha-band can be interpreted as top-down traveling waves, and it is most likely related to inhibitory processes, in line with previous studies (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Jensen and Mazaheri, 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Händel et al., 2011</xref>). However, different alpha-band oscillations propagate in a forward direction and are directly related to sensory processing, reconciling previous evidence linking alpha-band oscillations with visual processing (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib56">VanRullen and Macdonald, 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Lozano-Soldevilla and VanRullen, 2019</xref>).</p></sec><sec id="s2" sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><sec id="s2-1"><title>Traveling waves’ spectral profile</title><p>The goal of the study was to investigate how visual attention modulates alpha-band traveling waves in the hemisphere contra- and ipsilateral to the attended location. To test this, we considered 11 lines of electrodes running from occipital to frontal regions (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1C</xref>), 5 for each hemisphere and 1 midline. It is important to note that the spatial resolution of these lines is not critical for our analysis, as we do not expect significant differences within each hemisphere. However, before testing how visual attention modulates traveling waves, we explored the amount of waves propagating forward (FW) and backward (BW) as a function of their temporal frequency (see Figure 5 and methods for a detailed description of the analysis). <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1D</xref> shows the spectral profile of FW and BW waves in the midline (along the Oz–Fz axis) and the contra- and ipsilateral lines: confirming previous experimental studies (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Alamia and VanRullen, 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib41">Pang et al., 2020</xref>), we found that alpha-band oscillatory waves propagate in both directions during visual stimulation, whereas theta (4–7 Hz) and high-beta/gamma (24–45 Hz) bands propagate mostly bottom-up from occipital to frontal regions, and low-beta (13–23 Hz) waves flow in the top-down direction. Interestingly, this pattern of results confirms previous studies using different methods, in which higher frequency bands (i.e., high-beta/gamma) have been associated with forward processing, whereas low-beta and alpha frequencies have been related to top-down processing (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Bastos et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Bastos et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib55">van Kerkoerle et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">Michalareas et al., 2016</xref>; but see also <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib47">Schneider et al., 2021b</xref>).</p><fig id="fig1" position="float"><label>Figure 1.</label><caption><title>Experimental design and waves’ spectral profile.</title><p>(<bold>A</bold>) Each trial lasted 5 s, in which two flickering stimuli were presented to both hemifield.

We focused on trials where neither a target nor a distractor was presented. First, we quantified the amount of traveling waves in the contra- and ipsilateral hemispheres to the attentional allocation. As shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2</xref> (left column), we found a strong lateralization effect revealing an increase (respectively, decrease) of contralateral (ipsilateral) forward waves in the alpha-band, and the opposite pattern in waves propagating in the opposite direction. These results were confirmed by a Bayesian analysis of variance (ANOVA), considering as factors DIRECTION (FW or BW), LINES (distance from the midline), and LATERALITY (contra vs. ipsi). The results revealed strong evidence in favor of the interaction between DIRECTION and LATERALITY factors (BF<sub>10</sub> = 31.230, estimated error ~1%, <inline-formula><mml:math id="inf1"><mml:msup><mml:mrow><mml:mi>η</mml:mi></mml:mrow><mml:mrow><mml:mn>2</mml:mn></mml:mrow></mml:msup></mml:math></inline-formula> = 0.08 as estimated from a classical ANOVA), whereas all other factors and their interactions revealed evidence in favor of the absence of an effect (BFs<sub>10</sub> &lt; 0.3). We also found no significant effect in the other frequency bands (as shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1D</xref>, namely theta, low, and high beta), hence we focused the following analyses on alpha-band oscillatory waves. These results demonstrate that the direction of alpha-band oscillatory traveling waves shows a laterality effect during a task involving covert selective attention.</p><fig id="fig2" position="float"><label>Figure 2.</label><caption><title>Traveling waves block analysis.</title><p>Each column in the figure represents a different EEG dataset involving experiments with visual stimulation (left and middle columns) and without visual stimulation (right column).

One may then wonder about the relationship between alpha power and traveling waves. To address this question, we investigated whether the oscillatory activity we observe propagating through the cortex relates to the spectral power in either occipital or frontal regions. We computed the averaged alpha-band power in frontal and occipital areas, contra- and ipsilaterally to the target presentation, considering the same electrodes used for quantifying the traveling waves (see <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3A</xref>). Interestingly, we found a significant positive correlation between alpha-band power in both occipital and frontal regions and backward waves, but not with forward waves (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3A</xref> and <xref ref-type="table" rid="table1">Table 1</xref>). Next, we considered the lateralization effect in the alpha-band, as shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3B</xref> (topographic plot in the right panel) and well replicated in previous studies (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib45">Sauseng et al., 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib54">Thut et al., 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Händel et al., 2011</xref>). We wondered whether we could observe a correlation between such lateralization, defined as the difference between alpha-band power when attention is allocated to one side of the screen and to the other side, and the effect we reported in the traveling waves (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2</xref>).

In particular, we correlated trial-by-trial forward and backward waves with alpha-band power for each subject, obtaining correlation coefficients ‘<italic>r</italic>’ and their respective p values. As in the previous analysis, we correlated forward and backward waves with frontal and occipital electrodes in both contro- and ipsilateral hemispheres. We applied the Fisher method (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Fisher, 1992</xref>, see Methods for details) to combine all subjects’ p values in every conditions. Overall, we found a significant effect of all combined p values (p &lt; 0.0001), except in the lateralization condition (contra- minus ipsilateral hemisphere), similar to our previous analysis. Additionally, we tested for a consistent positive or negative distribution of the correlation coefficients. As shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3C</xref>, the results support a significant correlation between backward waves and alpha power in the hemisphere contralateral to the attended location (BF<sub>10</sub> = 10.7 and BF<sub>10</sub> = 7.4 for occipital and frontal regions, respectively; all other BF<sub>10</sub> were between 1 and 2, providing inconclusive evidence). Interestingly, this analysis also revealed a small but consistent effect in the correlation between lateralization effects, as we reported a consistently positive correlation in the contra- minus ipsilateral difference between forward waves and alpha power (BF<sub>10</sub> ~ 5 for both frontal and occipital electrodes). However, it is important to notice that the combined p values obtained using the Fisher method did not reach the significance threshold in the lateralization condition, reducing the relevance of this specific result.</p></sec><sec id="s2-4"><title>Covert attention modulates forward waves only with visual stimuli</title><p>To confirm our previous results, we replicated the same traveling waves analysis on two publicly available EEG datasets in which participants performed similar attentional tasks (experiment 1 of <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Foster et al., 2017</xref> and experiment 1 of <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Feldmann-Wüstefeld and Vogel, 2019</xref>). In the first experiment from the Feldmann-Wüstefeld and Vogel dataset, participants were instructed to perform a visual working memory task in which, while keeping a central fixation, they had to memorize a set of items while ignoring a group of distracting stimuli. We focused our analysis on those trials in which the visual items to remember were placed either to the right or the left side of the screen, while the distractors were either in the upper or lower part of the screen (we pulled together the trials with either two or four distractors, as this factor was irrelevant for our analysis). The stimuli were shown for 200 ms, and we computed the amount of forward and backward waves in the 500 ms following stimulus onset. As shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2</xref> (central column), the analysis confirmed our previous results, demonstrating a strong interaction between the factors DIRECTION and LATERALITY (BF<sub>10</sub> = 667, error ~2%; independently, the factors DIRECTION and LATERALITY had BF<sub>10</sub> = 0.2 and BF<sub>10</sub> = 0.4, respectively). These results confirmed that spatial attention modulates both forward and backward waves in the presence of visual stimulation. Next, we analyzed another publicly available dataset from <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Foster et al., 2017</xref>. In the first experiment of Foster’s study, participants completed a spatial cueing task, requiring them to identify a digit among distractor letters. After a central cue was displayed for 250 ms, participants attended one of eight locations for 1000 ms before the onset of the target and distractors. As in our design, participants allocated attention to different locations to the left or right of the screen while keeping central fixation. However, unlike in our and in Feldmann-Wüstefeld’s study, no stimulus was displayed while participants were attending one of the possible locations. Here, we assessed the amount of waves in the 1000 ms before the onset of the stimulus during attention allocation, when no visual stimuli were shown on the screen. Remarkably, as shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2</xref> (right panel), our analysis demonstrated an effect of the lateralization (LATERALITY: BF<sub>10</sub> = 3.571, error ~1%), revealing more waves contralateral to the attended location, but inconclusive results regarding the interaction between DIRECTION and LATERALITY (BF<sub>10</sub> = 2.056, error ~1%). However, using a classical ANOVA (i.e., without modeling the slope of the random terms), the interaction between DIRECTION and LATERALITY proved significant (<italic>F</italic>(1,16) = 9.81, p = 0.003, <inline-formula><mml:math id="inf2"><mml:mstyle displaystyle="true" scriptlevel="0"><mml:mrow><mml:msup><mml:mi>η</mml:mi><mml:mrow><mml:mn>2</mml:mn></mml:mrow></mml:msup></mml:mrow></mml:mstyle></mml:math></inline-formula> = 0.13). In addition, when testing LATERALITY separately for forward and backward waves, we observed an effect in the backward waves (BF<sub>10</sub> = 3.497, error &lt;0.01%) but not in the forward waves (BF<sub>10</sub> = 0.231, error &lt;0.01%, supporting evidence in favor of the absence of an effect). In addition, as analyzed in our dataset, we tested the correlation between backward waves and alpha-band power in occipital (electrodes: PO3 and PO4) and frontal (electrodes: F3 and F4) regions. We found moderate evidence of a positive correlation between contra- and ipsilateral backward waves, and occipital (all Pearson’s <italic>r</italic>~ = 0.4, all BFs<sub>10</sub>~ = 3) but inconclusive evidence in the frontal areas (all Pearson’s <italic>r</italic>~ = 0.3, all BFs<sub>10</sub>~ = 2). These results supported those from our dataset, despite having a smaller amount of electrodes’ lines, and potentially reduced statistical power (see <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2</xref>, lower panels). All in all, we could confirm our previous conclusion that covert visual attention modulates top-down oscillatory waves, showing this effect even in the absence of visual stimulation. In addition, we surmised that the lateralization effect we reported in the forward waves in our dataset (absent in the Foster dataset) is related to the steady visual stimulation during the attentional allocation, in line with our previous results demonstrating that oscillatory bottom-up waves reflect sensory processing (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Alamia and VanRullen, 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib41">Pang et al., 2020</xref>).</p></sec><sec id="s2-5"><title>Both detected targets and distractors elicit FW waves, but not missed targets</title><p>In our previous analysis, based on a subset of trials in which neither a target nor a distractor occurred, we demonstrated that sustained attention to one hemifield generates oscillatory alpha-band waves propagating forward in the contralateral hemisphere and backward in the ipsilateral one. We now assess whether the occurrence of a specific event, such as the onset of a target or a distractor stimulus, could induce the generation of transient oscillatory waves. For this reason, we replicated the same analysis on those trials including either a target or a distractor (on average, each participant performed 146.25 trials in each condition), to quantify the amount of waves locked to the onset of these events.</p><p>The upper panels of <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4A</xref> reveal the amount of forward and backward waves contralateral to the stimulus.

This result reveals that both target and distractor elicit forward waves propagating contralateral to the hemifield where they occur.

Interestingly, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4B</xref> reveals the amount of waves 400 ms before and after the onset of the stimulus, showing how a missed target is related to a decrease (increase) in forward (backward) waves contralateral (ipsilateral) to the attended location, possibly due to attentional fluctuations during each trial.</p><fig id="fig4" position="float"><label>Figure 4.</label><caption><title>Event analysis.</title><p>(<bold>A</bold>) The figure shows the amount of forward (in blue) and backward (in red) contralateral waves around the onset of the target/distractor (left) or hit and missed targets (right panel).

Here, we took a novel perspective on these results by interpreting oscillations as traveling waves (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">Muller et al., 2018</xref>), thus considering their spatial component on top of the temporal one. Our results revealed two distinct alpha-band waves propagating in opposite directions: attention modulates oscillations traveling from occipital to frontal regions only in the presence of visual stimulation, thus relating forward waves to visual processing (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Lozano-Soldevilla and VanRullen, 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib41">Pang et al., 2020</xref>); whereas oscillations propagating in the opposite, top-down direction were modulated by attention irrespective of the presence or absence of concurrent visual stimulation; as in standard studies of alpha power lateralization (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib60">Worden et al., 2000</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib45">Sauseng et al., 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Kelly et al., 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib54">Thut et al., 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Händel et al., 2011</xref>), this attentional modulation involved both an decrease of alpha waves contralateral to the attended location, and an ipsilateral increase.</p><p>In line with previous studies (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Gulbinaite et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Deng et al., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib48">Schuhmann et al., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib51">Sokoliuk et al., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Kasten et al., 2020</xref>), our results support the thesis that distinct alpha-band oscillations are involved in separate cognitive processes. A recent study from <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib51">Sokoliuk et al., 2019</xref> demonstrated two different sources of alpha-band oscillations during a multisensory task: one, located in visual areas, reflects the ‘spotlight of attention’ and decreases linearly with increasing attention, whereas another one indicates attentional efforts and occurs in parietal regions. Gulbinaite et al. also demonstrated that parietal, but not occipital alpha-band oscillations are responsible for the oscillatory reverberation causing the ‘triple-flash’ illusion (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Gulbinaite et al., 2017</xref>). Similarly, another study (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Kasten et al., 2020</xref>) disentangled two primary sources of alpha oscillations, revealing a differential effect of tACS stimulation on endogenous but not exogenous attention. The authors interpreted their results as evidence supporting the hypothesis that alpha-band oscillations play a causal role in top-down but not bottom-up attention (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib48">Schuhmann et al., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Kasten et al., 2020</xref>). Our results are consistent with these findings, including the spatial dimension in analyzing and interpreting alpha-band oscillations. Additionally, we also found a significant correlation between backward waves and occipital and frontal alpha-band power, consistently with Kasten’s study (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Kasten et al., 2020</xref>) and the inhibitory role of alpha-band oscillations. Our findings support the hypothesis that top-down processes, as reflected by backward waves, drive the well-documented hemispheric asymmetries reported in the literature (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Händel et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Klimesch, 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib58">Waldhauser et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib42">Peylo et al., 2021</xref>). All in all, previous studies and our results pave the way for a more comprehensive understanding of the role of alpha oscillations in cognition.</p><p>One may wonder whether alpha-band oscillations during attention relate to target enhancement or distractor suppression (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib46">Schneider et al., 2021a</xref>). In the first case, the desynchronization of alpha activity would favor the sensory processing in the hemisphere contralateral to the target, whereas in the second case, alpha synchronization would suppress the processing of the distractor (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Kelly et al., 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">Noonan et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib42">Peylo et al., 2021</xref>). Our findings do not address this question directly but provide another element to the picture, suggesting the intriguing hypothesis that target enhancement is not reflected in the alpha power decrease but rather in an increase in the contralateral alpha-band waves processing the target and propagating forward. Our results thus support the hypothesis that alpha waves are involved in both distractor suppression (via ipsilateral top-down inhibitory feedback) and target enhancement (via contralateral bottom-up alpha-band waves). Future studies will precisely characterize the anatomical pathways of the distinct alpha-band oscillations, possibly involving cortical dynamics in the ventral and dorsal streams (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Capilla et al., 2014</xref>) or corticothalamic connections (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Lopes da Silva et al., 1980</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Halgren et al., 2019</xref>).</p><p>Concerning the anatomical pathway of waves’ propagation, our analysis based on EEG recordings prevents us from clearly determining whether the observed waves propagate through the cortex or whether more localized dipoles generate such widespread observations at the sensor level. A previous source-analysis study on different visual-task datasets (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Lozano-Soldevilla and VanRullen, 2019</xref>) leaves both possibilities open. However, recent simulations on perceptual echo data (related to bottom-up, sensory waves, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib61">Zhigalov and Jensen, 2022</xref>) suggest that two dipoles in occipital and parietal regions could be responsible for the generation of the waves propagating in the occipital-to-frontal direction. Supposing this conclusion generalizes to raw EEG data and not only perceptual echoes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib56">VanRullen and Macdonald, 2012</xref>), one could speculate that visual attention modulates dipoles selectively in each hemisphere. However, one may wonder whether similar dipoles are also responsible for generating top-down waves in frontal regions or whether other mechanisms are involved in generating alpha-band backward waves.</p><p>Our previous work proposed an alternative cause for the generation of cortical waves (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Alamia and VanRullen, 2019</xref>). We demonstrated that a simple multilevel hierarchical model based on Predictive Coding (PC) principles and implementing biologically plausible constraints (temporal delays between brain areas and neural time constants) gives rise to oscillatory traveling waves propagating both forward and backward. This model is also consistent with the two-dipole hypothesis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib61">Zhigalov and Jensen, 2022</xref>), considering the interaction between the parietal and occipital areas (i.e., a model of two hierarchical levels). However, dipoles in parietal regions are unlikely to explain the observed pattern of top-down waves, suggesting that more frontal areas may be involved in generating the feedback. This hypothesis is in line with the PC framework, in which top-down connections have an inhibitory function, suppressing the activity predicted by higher-level regions (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Huang and Rao, 2011</xref>). Interestingly, Spratling proposed a simple reformulation of the terms in the PC equations that could describe it as a model of biased competition in visual attention, thus corroborating the interpretation of our finding within the PC framework (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib52">Spratling, 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib53">Spratling, 2012</xref>).</p><p>In conclusion, our study demonstrated the existence of two functionally distinct alpha-band traveling waves propagating in opposite directions and modulated by visual attention. Top-down waves prevail in the hemisphere ipsilateral to the attended location and are related to inhibitory functions, whereas forward waves reflect ongoing visual processes in the contralateral hemisphere.</p></sec><sec id="s4" sec-type="methods"><title>Methods</title><sec id="s4-1"><title>Participants</title><p>EEG data were recorded from 16 volunteers (aged 20–32 years old, four women, three left-handed).

After setting the EEG device and placing the electrodes, participants performed the task in a dim and quiet room. The experiment was composed of 10 blocks of 60 trials each. During each trial (described in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1A</xref>), two flickering luminance disks were displayed for 5 s, 9° to the left and right from the center of the screen. The flicker had a frequency of 160 Hz, and the intensities were pooled from a uniform distribution. We chose to apply flickering stimulation to keep participants engaged in the task and avoid attentional captures due to sudden target/distractor onset and offset (see below). Before each block, participants were instructed to allocate attention to either the right or the left stimulus while focusing on a central arrow located at the center of the screen. The arrow pointed to the attended location and served as a visual reminder throughout the block. In half of the trials, a target or a distractor flashed 100 ms inside the attended or non-attended stimulus (see <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1A</xref>). Their onset could occur any time after the first 500 ms of the trial. Both target and distractor were squares whose luminance was a percentage of the disk’s luminance (i.e., when at 100%, targets/distractors were indiscernible from the disk, as they have the same luminance). A QUEST algorithm (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib59">Watson and Pelli, 1983</xref>) modulated such percentage to keep participants’ performance around 80% throughout the experiment (see <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1B</xref>). In the other half of the trials, either the target followed the distractor’s onset, or neither the target nor the distractor was presented (in sum, four possible trials occurred with the same frequency: either only a target, or only a distractor, or a target preceded by a distractor, or neither of them). Participants reported whether they saw a target only at each trial’s end to prevent motor activity from confounding the EEG signals. All stimuli were generated in MATLAB using the Psychtoolbox (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Brainard, 1997</xref>).</p><p>We included two additional datasets in this study. In both studies, participants performed a visual attention task while keeping their fixation in the center of the screen. Regarding the (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Feldmann-Wüstefeld and Vogel, 2019</xref>) study, participants were asked to memorize the colors of two stimuli while ignoring a set of distractors stimuli. We analyzed uniquely those trials in which the visual stimuli were presented to the left or right side of the screen, while the distractors were placed above or below the fixation cross. After 500 ms of the fixation cross, two colored ‘target’ stimuli were presented for 200 ms. Participants were asked to memorize these stimuli, and a new ‘probe’ stimulus was shown after an additional second. Participants reported whether the probe matched the target stimuli or not. We analyzed the traveling waves in the 500 ms following the target stimulus onset.</p><p>Participants performed a spatial attention task in the second dataset from <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Foster et al., 2017</xref>. First, the fixation cross cued participants to covertly attend one of eight possible spatial positions uniformly distributed around the center of the screen. After 1 s, a digit was displayed either in the cued location or in any other one. The remaining locations were filled with letters. Participants were instructed to report the displayed digit. We analyzed the waves the second before the stimuli onset when participants were attending to the locations cued to the left or right side of the screen (we discarded trials in which participants attended locations above or below the fixation cross).

Importantly, we carefully discarded from all analyses all trials in which the EOG signals revealed eye movements.</p></sec><sec id="s4-4"><title>Traveling wave analysis</title><p>As in our previous studies (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Alamia et al., 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib41">Pang et al., 2020</xref>), we quantified traveling waves’ propagation along 11 lines of seven electrodes, running from occipital to frontal regions. As shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1C</xref>, we considered one midline (Oz, POz, Pz, CPz, Cz, FCz, and Fz) and five lines spreading through the left and right hemispheres, symmetrically to the midline. The electrodes’ choice overlapped and covered a large portion of each hemisphere. For each set of seven electrodes, we created 2D maps by sliding a 500-ms time window over the EEG signals (having a 250-ms overlap) and computing 2D-FFT representations of each map (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5B</xref>). Notably, the power in the lower and upper quadrants quantifies the amount of waves propagating forward (FW – from occipital to frontal electrodes) and backward (BW – from frontal to occipital), respectively (see <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5A</xref>). Next, we performed the same procedure after shuffling the electrodes to obtain a baseline with the same spectral power but without information about the amount of FW/BW waves (note in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1D</xref> that the surrogate distribution accounts for the typical <inline-formula><mml:math id="inf3"><mml:mfrac><mml:mrow><mml:mn>1</mml:mn></mml:mrow><mml:mrow><mml:mi>f</mml:mi></mml:mrow></mml:mfrac></mml:math></inline-formula> power trend, as well as the alpha peak). Lastly, for each frequency in the range [2–45 Hz], we extracted the maximum values in the 2D-FFT spectra in both the real (FW and BW) and the shuffled data (FW<sub>ss</sub> and BW<sub>ss</sub>), obtaining the waves’ amount in decibel [dB] as:<disp-formula id="equ1"><mml:math id="m1"><mml:mrow><mml:mi>F</mml:mi><mml:mi>W</mml:mi><mml:mi>w</mml:mi><mml:mi>a</mml:mi><mml:mi>v</mml:mi><mml:mi>e</mml:mi><mml:mi>s</mml:mi><mml:mrow><mml:mo>[</mml:mo><mml:mrow><mml:mi mathvariant="normal">d</mml:mi><mml:mi mathvariant="normal">B</mml:mi></mml:mrow><mml:mo>]</mml:mo></mml:mrow><mml:mo>=</mml:mo><mml:mrow><mml:mn>10</mml:mn><mml:mo>∗</mml:mo><mml:mi mathvariant="normal">l</mml:mi><mml:mi mathvariant="normal">o</mml:mi><mml:msub><mml:mi mathvariant="normal">g</mml:mi><mml:mrow><mml:mn>10</mml:mn></mml:mrow></mml:msub></mml:mrow><mml:mrow><mml:mo>(</mml:mo><mml:mfrac><mml:mrow><mml:mi>F</mml:mi><mml:mi>W</mml:mi></mml:mrow><mml:mrow><mml:mi>F</mml:mi><mml:msub><mml:mi>W</mml:mi><mml:mrow><mml:mi>s</mml:mi><mml:mi>s</mml:mi></mml:mrow></mml:msub></mml:mrow></mml:mfrac><mml:mo>)</mml:mo></mml:mrow><mml:mo>;</mml:mo><mml:mi>B</mml:mi><mml:mi>W</mml:mi><mml:mi>w</mml:mi><mml:mi>a</mml:mi><mml:mi>v</mml:mi><mml:mi>e</mml:mi><mml:mi>s</mml:mi><mml:mrow><mml:mo>[</mml:mo><mml:mrow><mml:mi>d</mml:mi><mml:mi>B</mml:mi></mml:mrow><mml:mo>]</mml:mo></mml:mrow><mml:mo>=</mml:mo><mml:mn>10</mml:mn><mml:mo>∗</mml:mo><mml:msub><mml:mrow><mml:mi mathvariant="normal">l</mml:mi><mml:mi mathvariant="normal">o</mml:mi><mml:mi mathvariant="normal">g</mml:mi></mml:mrow><mml:mrow><mml:mn>10</mml:mn></mml:mrow></mml:msub><mml:mrow><mml:mo>(</mml:mo><mml:mfrac><mml:mrow><mml:mi>B</mml:mi><mml:mi>W</mml:mi></mml:mrow><mml:mrow><mml:mi>B</mml:mi><mml:msub><mml:mi>W</mml:mi><mml:mrow><mml:mi>s</mml:mi><mml:mi>s</mml:mi></mml:mrow></mml:msub></mml:mrow></mml:mfrac><mml:mo>)</mml:mo></mml:mrow></mml:mrow></mml:math></disp-formula></p><fig id="fig5" position="float"><label>Figure 5.</label><caption><title>Waves analysis.</title><p>(<bold>A</bold>) The 2D-Fast Fourier Trasform (2D-FFT) decomposes an image (e.g., a space-time representation of an EEG signal) into its spectral components. The upper part shows the decomposition of a 2D sinusoid propagating along the vertical or horizontal axis of the image. The corresponding peaks are found on the axis in the spectral domain, and their position depends on the frequency of the oscillations. The lower part of the figure shows how the spectra change when the oscillations propagate with a backward- or forward- like pattern. Importantly, the spectral peaks rotate in two of the four quadrants depending on the direction, providing a reliable measure of forward or backward waves in the image. (<bold>B</bold>) Schematic of the waves’ quantification method. After defining time windows over each electrode line, we computed 2D Fourier transformation to quantify the amount of forward (in blue) and backward (in red) waves. From the upper and lower quadrants of the 2D-FFT spectra, we consider the maximum value over spatial frequencies, providing a 1D spectrum of forward and backward waves in the temporal frequency domain. The same procedure after shuffling the electrodes’ order provides a surrogate measure, used as a baseline. Notably, such surrogate distribution captures the 1/f trend and the alpha-band peak, accounting for these factors in the final waves’ quantification.</p></caption><graphic mimetype="image" mime-subtype="tiff" xlink:href="elife-85035-fig5-v2.tif"/></fig><p>This value quantifies the total waves compared to the null distribution, thus being informative when contrasted against zero. Importantly, this waves analysis is limited to the surface level, and does not directly inform about the underlying sources. It is also necessary to keep in mind issues related to long-range connections and distortions due to scalp interference (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">Nunez, 1974</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Alexander et al., 2019</xref>).</p><sec id="s4-4-1"><title>Block analysis</title><p>This analysis quantified the amount of traveling waves across all trials when neither a target nor a distractor appeared. Participants paid attention to either one or the other side of the screen, thus defining a controlateral and an ipsilateral hemisphere (see <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1C</xref>). First, we averaged the forward and backward waves separately (in dB, see above) for each map computed along the 11 lines of electrodes within the 5-s trial (five lines for each hemisphere and the midline). Next, we averaged the results between trials, thus obtaining five contralateral and five ipsilateral spectra per subject for both FW and BW waves. Although our hypothesis focuses on alph-band oscillations, we also assessed the amount of waves in other frequency bands. Accordingly, from each spectrum, we computed the average per frequency band defined as ϑ (4–7 Hz), α (8–12 Hz), low β (13–24 Hz), and high β/γ (25–45 Hz). Besides following the frequency band definition found in the literature, such division reflects the waves’ profile observed in the midline (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1D</xref>). Then, we normalized each pair of symmetric lines (e.g., L1) by subtracting their mean value separately for each frequency band (i.e., <inline-formula><mml:math id="inf4"><mml:mfrac><mml:mrow><mml:msub><mml:mrow><mml:mi>L</mml:mi></mml:mrow><mml:mrow><mml:mi>i</mml:mi><mml:mo>,</mml:mo><mml:mi>c</mml:mi><mml:mi>o</mml:mi><mml:mi>n</mml:mi><mml:mi>t</mml:mi><mml:mi>r</mml:mi><mml:mi>a</mml:mi></mml:mrow></mml:msub><mml:mo>+</mml:mo><mml:msub><mml:mrow><mml:mi>L</mml:mi></mml:mrow><mml:mrow><mml:mi>i</mml:mi><mml:mo>,</mml:mo><mml:mi>i</mml:mi><mml:mi>p</mml:mi><mml:mi>s</mml:mi><mml:mi>i</mml:mi></mml:mrow></mml:msub></mml:mrow><mml:mrow><mml:mn>2</mml:mn></mml:mrow></mml:mfrac></mml:math></inline-formula>). This normalization allows to remove power differences across lines (e.g., L1, L2, etc.) and to compare the effects between hemispheres. Lastly, we tested an ANOVA considering as factors DIRECTION (either FW or BW), LINE (a value from 1 to 5 to define the distance from the midline), LATERALITY (contra- vs. ipsilateral), and all their interactions. We considered SUBJECTS as the random factor in the model. All models in this study relied on Bayesian statistics (see below for details). We performed the same analysis on the EEG recordings from the second dataset (16 participants performing a similar attentional task, see <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Foster et al., 2017</xref>, data available online at <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://osf.io/m64ue">https://osf.io/m64ue</ext-link>).

First, we estimated the mean alpha power in contra- and ipsilateral electrodes in both frontal and parieto-occipital regions, using the same electrodes involved in the waves’ analysis (see <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3B</xref>). We computed power spectra using wavelet transform (1–45 Hz in log-space frequency steps with 1–20 cycles) for all trials when neither a target nor a distractor appeared. We then correlated the mean alpha power in both frontal and posterior regions with alpha-band forward and backward waves between subjects in both contra- and ipsilateral hemispheres. We reported Bayes Factor (BF) and Pearson’s coefficients. Additionally, we computed trial-by-trial correlations between waves and alpha power for all participants. First, we tested the correlation coefficient against zero in all conditions.

We also include an acceptance summary that explains what the editors found interesting or important about the work.</p></boxed-text><p><bold>Decision letter after peer review:</bold></p><p>Thank you for submitting your article &quot;Distinct roles of forward and backward α-band waves in spatial visual attention&quot; for consideration by <italic>eLife</italic>. Your article has been reviewed by 2 peer reviewers, and the evaluation has been overseen by a Reviewing Editor and Chris Baker as the Senior Editor. The following individual involved in the review of your submission has agreed to reveal their identity: Christian Keitel (Reviewer #1).</p><p>The reviewers have discussed their reviews with one another, and the Reviewing Editor has drafted this to help you prepare a revised submission.</p><p>Essential revisions:</p><p>1) Although the results are in line with the conclusions drawn, some questions remain. The authors investigate the relationship between traveling α waves and the hemispheric lateralization of α power, which is a well-established neural signature of spatial attention. Surprisingly, the lateralization of α power shown in Figure 3B appears relatively weak in the present dataset (by visual inspection), which raises the question of whether the investigation of a relation between lateralized α power and α traveling waves is warranted in the first place.</p><p>(1b) Furthermore, the authors employ between-subject correlations (with N = 16) to test the relationship between α traveling waves and (lateralized) α power. However, as inter-individual differences in patterns of travelling waves are not the main focus here, within-subject analyses of the same relations would be able to test the authors' hypotheses much more directly.</p><p>2) For any naive reader the concept of travelling waves may be hard to grasp in the way data are currently presented – only based on the results of the 2D-FFT. Can forward and backward-travelling waves be illustrated in a representative example to make this more intuitive?</p><p>3) Findings from both datasets were difficult to discern and more effort should be made to highlight these. Also, a major conclusion &quot;the directionality effect [effect of attention on forward waves] only occurs for visual stimulation&quot; only rested on a qualitative comparison between studies. The authors have improved on this here, e.g., by toning down this conclusion. One thing that is still missing is a graphical representation of the data from Foster et al. (the second dataset analysed here) that would support the statistical results and allow the reader a visual comparison between the sets of findings.</p><p>4) Given that the Direction x Laterality interaction reported on page 9 was inconclusive (and likely not statistically significant) it is a bit difficult to interpret the apparent presence of an effect for forward waves only. Since the analysis pipeline appears to be very straightforward, it might be an option to support the claims by including one or two additional spatial attention datasets in the analysis.</p><p>In order to better understand the results, it would be helpful to show a temporally resolved plot of the power of forward and backward waves across the trial time course.</p><p><italic>Reviewer #1 (Recommendations for the authors):</italic></p><p>– Abstract: Mention &quot;(N=16 each)&quot; when introducing the studies.</p><p>– One idea to strengthen the &quot;travelling&quot; part of the wave would be to present a phase progression analysis of sorts that demonstrates a consistent phase difference in α oscillations along the &quot;lines&quot; of electrodes, potentially converted to physiologically plausible latencies that correspond to conduction delays. These could be of interest: Nunez et al. (2001) https://doi.org/10.1002/hbm.1030, Burkitt et al. 2000 https://doi.org/10.1016/S1388-2457(99)00194-7</p><p>– The Foster et al. dataset remains underspecified in the paper. I appreciate that this is available elsewhere but it would be great to provide some basic information somewhere in the paper. A separate section in the Methods that gives a few details on how the analysis differed from the 'main' dataset would be appreciated.</p><p>– For some of the analyses, data is broken down in increasingly smaller chunks based on target/distractor presence and behavioural outcome. However, I couldn't find information on how many trials were available per &quot;condition&quot; (on avg) for these. This seems important to convince the reader of an acceptable SNR for these analyses.</p><p><italic>Reviewer #2 (Recommendations for the authors):</italic></p><p>The Introduction is well written but the authors might want to structure the text into a few paragraphs (also applies to other sections of the manuscript).</p><p>At the end of the introduction, the authors state the hypothesis that two functionally distinct α-band oscillations propagate along the frontal-occipital line in opposite directions. It was a bit unclear where this hypothesis exactly comes from. The authors might want to explain the justification of this hypothesis in more detail or make a more balanced statement with respect to the question of whether this precise pattern was indeed hypothesized a priori.</p><p>I appreciate the reporting of Bayes Factors but since the present manuscript reports new findings (which will potentially be tested in new datasets in the future), it would be nice to report effect sizes as well.</p><p>In Figure 1D, it was a bit unclear to me what 0 (on the y-axis) refers to. The authors might want to report this in the caption.</p><p>The authors report between-subject correlation analyses (with N = 16) but as far as I understand, within-subject analyses (which are better powered) would test their claims more directly. Regarding α lateralization, it would be important to see whether the absence of a relation between lateralized α power and traveling waves' direction holds on a within-subject (single-trial) level. Between-subject correlations instead assume that there are robust and interpretable interindividual differences between subjects, which is at present unclear and possibly not what the authors want to demonstrate here.</p><p>The α lateralization in Figure 3B looks rather weak and it was not entirely clear to me what the unit (in colour) exactly is (probably a simple difference between attend-left and attend-right trials). Often, a lateralization index is used in the literature, which is more robust as it normalizes the lateralization for overall power. Also, I did not find a statistical test for this α lateralization pattern in the text. It would be important to demonstrate that a robust and statistically significant α lateralization is present in this dataset. Otherwise, it would be difficult to interpret the ensuing correlations of α lateralization with traveling waves.</p><p>Given that the Direction x Laterality interaction reported on page 9 was inconclusive (and likely not statistically significant) it is a bit difficult to interpret the apparent presence of an effect for forward waves only. Since the analysis pipeline appears to be very straightforward, it might be an option to support the claims by including one or two additional spatial attention datasets in the analysis.</p><p>In order to better understand the results, it would be helpful to show a temporally resolved plot of the power of forward and backward waves across the trial time course.</p><p>Page 11: &quot;as in standard studies of α power lateralization (Worden et al., 2000; Sauseng et al., 2005; Kelly et al., 2006; Thut et al., 2006; Händel et al., 2011), this attentional modulation involved both an increase of α waves contralateral to the attended location, and an ipsilateral decrease&quot;.

Also, a major conclusion &quot;the directionality effect [effect of attention on forward waves] only occurs for visual stimulation&quot; only rested on a qualitative comparison between studies. The authors have improved on this here, e.g., by toning down this conclusion. One thing that is still missing is a graphical representation of the data from Foster et al. (the second dataset analysed here) that would support the statistical results and allow the reader a visual comparison between the sets of findings.</p></disp-quote><p>We are glad that the reviewer recognizes the improvement in the presentation of the conclusions. According to their suggestions, we have modified figure 2, not only by including a third dataset (see point below) but also in a way that allows a direct comparison between the three datasets. Specifically, the results from the three datasets are now shown in three columns next to each other. The first row shows the FW and BW waves in contra and ipsilateral lines of electrodes: our dataset and the one from Feldmann-Wustefeld and colleagues (the first and the second column in the figure, both with visual stimulation) shows a clear interaction between direction and laterality, as confirmed by the statistical analysis. The dataset from Foster and colleagues (the third column, no visual stimulation) shows a laterality effect only in the backward waves but not in the forward ones, in line with the hypothesis that FW waves are modulated only in the presence of visual stimulation. The second row shows a schematic representation of the task, and the third row illustrates the electrodes' lines used in each dataset. We hope the reviewer will be satisfied with the current data presentation.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>4) Given that the Direction x Laterality interaction reported on page 9 was inconclusive (and likely not statistically significant) it is a bit difficult to interpret the apparent presence of an effect for forward waves only. Since the analysis pipeline appears to be very straightforward, it might be an option to support the claims by including one or two additional spatial attention datasets in the analysis.</p></disp-quote><p>We have now included a third dataset in the paper. In this dataset, from (Feldmann-Wüstefeld and Vogel, 2019), participants performed a visual working memory task by attending either the left or the right side of the screen where a stimulus was displayed. We analyzed the amount of waves during stimulus presentation, and we found the same results as in our own dataset: very strong evidence in favor of an interaction between LATERALITY (contra- and ipsilateral) and DIRECTION (FW and BW). We now included the results in figure 2 (see point above) and in the Results section of the manuscript. Unfortunately, we couldn't find any other publicly available EEG dataset in which participants attend to either side of the screen without ongoing visual stimulation.</p><p>In addition, we re-analyzed our main findings (i.e. the interaction between LATERALITY and DIRECTION) in all three datasets using a classic ANOVA to report the effect size as η<sup>2</sup> (see point above). Unlike the Bayesian ANOVA (which -in JASP- is based on linear mixed models), the classic one does not model the slope of the random effects. Yet, we observed that the LATERALITY x DIRECTION interaction in the Foster dataset proved very significant, with a large effect size (F(1,16)=9.81, p=0.003, η<sup>2</sup>=0.13). Supposedly, modeling the slope of the random effects in the Bayesian ANOVA lowered its statistical sensitivity. For the sake of completeness, we reported both results in the manuscript.</p><p>From the Results section:</p><p>“To confirm our previous results, we replicated the same traveling waves analysis on two publicly available EEG datasets in which participants performed similar attentional tasks (experiment 1 of Feldmann-Wüstefeld and Vogel, 2019 and experiment 1 of Foster et al., 2017). In the first experiment from the Feldmann-Wüstefeld and Vogel dataset, participants were instructed to perform a visual working memory task in which, while keeping a central fixation, they had to memorize a set of items while ignoring a group of distracting stimuli. We focused our analysis on those trials in which the visual items to remember were placed either to the right or the left side of the screen, while the distractors were either in the upper or lower part of the screen (we pulled together the trials with either 2 or 4 distractors, as this factor was irrelevant for the purposes of our analysis). The stimuli were shown for 200ms, and we computed the amount of forward and backward waves in the 500ms following stimulus onset. As shown in figure 2 (central column), the analysis confirmed our previous results, demonstrating a strong interaction between the factors DIRECTION and LATERALITY (BF<sub>10</sub>=667, error~2%; independently, the factors DIRECTION and LATERALITY had BF<sub>10</sub>=0.2 and BF<sub>10</sub>=0.4, respectively). These results confirmed that, in the presence of visual stimulation, spatial attention modulates both forward and backward waves. Next, we analyzed another publicly available dataset from Foster et al., 2017. […]”</p><p>“Remarkably, as shown in figure 2 (right panel), our analysis demonstrated an effect of the lateralization (LATERALITY: BF<sub>10</sub>=3.571, error~1%), revealing more waves contralateral to the attended location, but inconclusive results regarding the interaction between DIRECTION and LATERALITY (BF<sub>10</sub>=2.056, error~1%). However, using a classical ANOVA (i.e., without modeling the slope of the random terms), the interaction between DIRECTION and LATERALITY proved significant (F(1,16)=9.81, p=0.003, η<sup>2</sup>=0.13).”</p><p>From the Methods section:</p><p>“Furthermore, we included EEG recordings from two additional publicly available datasets investigating distinct scientific questions and using different analyses than our study. In the first one, 31 participants performed a visual working memory task involving spatial attention. The data were published in a previous study (Feldmann-Wüstefeld and Vogel, 2019, data available online at https://osf.io/a65xz/). In the second dataset, 16 participants performed a task involving covert spatial attention. These data were published in another study (Foster et al., 2017, data available online at https://osf.io/m64ue). The number of participants in our dataset was estimated based on a power analysis of previous studies investigating travelling waves in vision (Luo et al., 2021) and to match the number of participant in the third dataset (Foster et al., 2017).”</p><p>&quot;We included two additional datasets in this study. In both studies, participants performed a visual attention task while keeping their fixation in the center of the screen. Regarding the Feldmann-Wüstefeld and Vogel, 2019 study, participants were asked to memorize the colors of two stimuli while ignoring a set of distractors stimuli. We analyzed uniquely those trials in which the visual stimuli were presented to the left or right side of the screen, while the distractors were placed above or below the fixation cross. After 500ms of the fixation cross, two colored 'target' stimuli were presented for 200ms. Participants were asked to memorize these stimuli, and a new 'probe’ stimulus was shown after an additional second. Participants reported whether the probe matched the target stimuli or not. We analyzed the traveling waves in the 500ms following the target stimulus onset.</p><p>Participants performed a spatial attention task in the second dataset from Foster et al. 2017.

Participants were instructed to report the only displayed digit. We analyzed the waves the second before the stimuli onset when participants attended to the locations cued to the left or right side of the screen (we discarded trials in which participants attended locations above or below the fixation cross).

The updated figure 1 should now be helpful in clarifying the ‘travelling’ part of the waves, providing some examples.

In this study, we have decided to apply the 2DFFT method because it proves, on average, more robust to noise (Alamia et al. 2020), as it considers all electrodes at once in a given time window (it would not be straightforward to have the same advantage using an approach based on the phases). The main limitation is that it sets a strong prior on the direction of propagation of the waves.

In order to quantify the effect, we performed an analysis similar to (Thut et al., 2006), defining a laterality index as:  <inline-formula><mml:math id="sa2m4"><mml:mstyle displaystyle="true" scriptlevel="0"><mml:mrow><mml:msub><mml:mtext>index</mml:mtext><mml:mrow><mml:mi>a</mml:mi></mml:mrow></mml:msub><mml:mo>=</mml:mo><mml:mfrac><mml:mrow><mml:mi>α</mml:mi><mml:mrow><mml:mo>(</mml:mo><mml:mrow><mml:mtext>ipsi</mml:mtext><mml:mtext> </mml:mtext><mml:mtext>ROI</mml:mtext></mml:mrow><mml:mo>)</mml:mo></mml:mrow><mml:mo>−</mml:mo><mml:mi>α</mml:mi><mml:mo stretchy="false">(</mml:mo><mml:mtext>contra</mml:mtext><mml:mtext> </mml:mtext><mml:mtext>ROI</mml:mtext><mml:mo stretchy="false">)</mml:mo></mml:mrow><mml:mrow><mml:mtext>mean</mml:mtext><mml:mtext> </mml:mtext><mml:mtext>of</mml:mtext><mml:mtext> </mml:mtext><mml:mi>α</mml:mi><mml:mo stretchy="false">(</mml:mo><mml:mtext>contra</mml:mtext><mml:mo>+</mml:mo><mml:mtext>ipsi</mml:mtext><mml:mtext> </mml:mtext><mml:mtext>ROI</mml:mtext><mml:mo stretchy="false">)</mml:mo></mml:mrow></mml:mfrac></mml:mrow></mml:mstyle></mml:math></inline-formula></p><p>We computed such index for occipital electrodes, and on their average. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="sa2fig1">Author response image 1</xref> reveals that for most electrodes, including their average, the laterality index is significantly larger than 0, confirming the presence of an α-band lateralization effect. However, we also note that the size of the effect, around 0.04, is reduced as compared to the study by Thut and colleagues, which was between 0.05 and 0.10.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Given that the Direction x Laterality interaction reported on page 9 was inconclusive (and likely not statistically significant) it is a bit difficult to interpret the apparent presence of an effect for forward waves only. Since the analysis pipeline appears to be very straightforward, it might be an option to support the claims by including one or two additional spatial attention datasets in the analysis.</p></disp-quote><p>We have now included a third dataset in the paper. In this dataset, from (Feldmann-Wüstefeld and Vogel, 2019), participants performed a visual working memory task by attending either the left or the right side of the screen where a stimulus was displayed. We analyzed the amount of waves during stimulus presentation, and we found the same results as in our own dataset: very strong evidence in favor of an interaction between LATERALITY (contra- and ipsilateral) and DIRECTION (FW and BW). We now included the results in figure 2 (see point above) and in the Results section of the manuscript. Unfortunately, we couldn't find any other publicly available EEG dataset in which participants attend to either side of the screen without ongoing visual stimulation.</p><p>In addition, we re-analyzed our main findings (i.e. the interaction between LATERALITY and DIRECTION) in all three datasets using a classic ANOVA to report the effect size as η<sup>2</sup> (see point above). Unlike the Bayesian ANOVA (which -in JASP- is based on linear mixed models), the classic one does not model the slope of the random effects. Yet, we observed that the LATERALITY x DIRECTION interaction in the Foster dataset proved very significant, with a large effect size (F(1,16)=9.81, p=0.003, η<sup>2</sup>=0.13). Supposedly, modeling the slope of the random effects in the Bayesian ANOVA lowered its statistical sensitivity. For the sake of completeness, we reported both results in the manuscript.</p><p>From the Results section:</p><p>“To confirm our previous results, we replicated the same traveling waves analysis on two publicly available EEG datasets in which participants performed similar attentional tasks (experiment 1 of Foster et al., 2017 and experiment 1 of Feldmann-Wüstefeld and Vogel, 2019). In the first experiment from the Feldmann-Wüstefeld and Vogel dataset, participants were instructed to perform a visual working memory task in which, while keeping a central fixation, they had to memorize a set of items while ignoring a group of distracting stimuli. We focused our analysis on those trials in which the visual items to remember were placed either to the right or the left side of the screen, while the distractors were either in the upper or lower part of the screen (we pulled together the trials with either 2 or 4 distractors, as this factor was irrelevant for the purposes of our analysis). The stimuli were shown for 200ms, and we computed the amount of forward and backward waves in the 500ms following stimulus onset. As shown in figure 2 (central column), the analysis confirmed our previous results, demonstrating a strong interaction between the factors DIRECTION and LATERALITY (BF<sub>10</sub>=667, error~2%; independently, the factors DIRECTION and LATERALITY had BF<sub>10</sub>=0.2 and BF<sub>10</sub>=0.4, respectively). These results confirmed that, in the presence of visual stimulation, spatial attention modulates both forward and backward waves. Next, we analyzed another publicly available dataset from Foster et al., 2017. […]”</p><p>“Remarkably, as shown in figure 2 (right panel), our analysis demonstrated an effect of the lateralization (LATERALITY: BF<sub>10</sub>=3.571, error~1%), revealing more waves contralateral to the attended location, but inconclusive results regarding the interaction between DIRECTION and LATERALITY (BF<sub>10</sub>=2.056, error~1%). However, using a classical ANOVA (i.e., without modeling the slope of the random terms), the interaction between DIRECTION and LATERALITY proved significant (F(1,16)=9.81, p=0.003, η<sup>2</sup>=0.13).”</p><p>From the Methods section:</p><p>&quot;We included two additional datasets in this study. In both studies, participants performed a visual attention task while keeping their fixation in the center of the screen. Regarding the Feldmann-Wüstefeld and Vogel, 2019 study, participants were asked to memorize the colors of two stimuli while ignoring a set of distractors stimuli. We analyzed uniquely those trials in which the visual stimuli were presented to the left or right side of the screen, while the distractors were placed above or below the fixation cross. After 500ms of the fixation cross, two colored 'target' stimuli were presented for 200ms. Participants were asked to memorize these stimuli, and a new 'probe’ stimulus was shown after an additional second. Participants reported whether the probe matched the target stimuli or not. We analyzed the traveling waves in the 500ms following the target stimulus onset.</p><p>Participants performed a spatial attention task in the second dataset from Foster et al. 2017. First, the fixation cross cued participants to covertly attend one of eight possible spatial positions uniformly distributed around the center of the screen. After one second, a digit was displayed either in the cued location or in any other one. The remaining locations were filled with letters. Participants were instructed to report the only displayed digit. We analyzed the waves the second before the stimuli onset when participants attended to the locations cued to the left or right side of the screen (we discarded trials in which participants attended locations above or below the fixation cross). For additional details about both experimental procedures, we refer the reader to Foster et al., 2017 and Feldmann-Wüstefeld and Vogel, 2019.”</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>In order to better understand the results, it would be helpful to show a temporally resolved plot of the power of forward and backward waves across the trial time course.</p></disp-quote><p>We thank the reviewer for the interesting suggestion. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="sa2fig2">Author response image 2</xref> shows the amount of forward and backward waves in the hemisphere contralateral to the attended location as a function of time.
