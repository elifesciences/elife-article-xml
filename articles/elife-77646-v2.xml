This phenomenon, called epigenetic transcriptional memory, accelerates reactivation, and requires both changes in chromatin structure and recruitment of poised RNA polymerase II (RNAPII) to the promoter. Memory of inositol starvation in budding yeast involves a positive feedback loop between transcription factor-dependent interaction with the nuclear pore complex and histone H3 lysine 4 dimethylation (H3K4me2). While H3K4me2 is essential for recruitment of RNAPII and faster reactivation, RNAPII is not required for H3K4me2. Unlike RNAPII-dependent H3K4me2 associated with transcription, RNAPII-independent H3K4me2 requires Nup100, SET3C, the Leo1 subunit of the Paf1 complex and, upon degradation of an essential transcription factor, is inherited through multiple cell cycles. The writer of this mark (COMPASS) physically interacts with the potential reader (SET3C), suggesting a molecular mechanism for the spreading and re-incorporation of H3K4me2 following DNA replication.</p></abstract><kwd-group kwd-group-type="author-keywords"><kwd>epigenetics</kwd><kwd>chromatin</kwd><kwd>nuclear pore</kwd><kwd>fitness</kwd><kwd>mitosis</kwd><kwd>transcriptional memory</kwd></kwd-group><kwd-group kwd-group-type="research-organism"><title>Research organism</title><kwd><italic>S. cerevisiae</italic></kwd></kwd-group><funding-group><award-group id="fund1"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000057</institution-id><institution>National Institute of General Medical Sciences</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>R35 GM136419</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Sump</surname><given-names>Bethany</given-names></name><name><surname>Brickner</surname><given-names>Donna G</given-names></name><name><surname>D'Urso</surname><given-names>Agustina</given-names></name><name><surname>Kim</surname><given-names>Seo Hyun</given-names></name><name><surname>Brickner</surname><given-names>Jason H</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund2"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000057</institution-id><institution>National Institute of General Medical Sciences</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>R01 GM118712</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Sump</surname><given-names>Bethany</given-names></name><name><surname>Brickner</surname><given-names>Donna G</given-names></name><name><surname>D'Urso</surname><given-names>Agustina</given-names></name><name><surname>Kim</surname><given-names>Seo Hyun</given-names></name><name><surname>Brickner</surname><given-names>Jason H</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund3"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000057</institution-id><institution>National Institute of General Medical Sciences</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>T32 GM008061</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>D'Urso</surname><given-names>Agustina</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><funding-statement>The funders had no role in study design, data collection and interpretation, or the decision to submit the work for publication.</funding-statement></funding-group><custom-meta-group><custom-meta specific-use="meta-only"><meta-name>Author impact statement</meta-name><meta-value>During epigenetic transcriptional memory in budding yeast, histone H3 lysine 4 dimethylation - dependent on Nup1000 and independent of RNA polymerase II - regulates binding of a critical transcription factor and, once established, is mitotically heritable for at least four cell divisions.</meta-value></custom-meta></custom-meta-group></article-meta></front><body><sec id="s1" sec-type="intro"><title>Introduction</title><p>Cells react to changes in their environment by altering gene expression, primarily by regulating transcription of inducible genes. The rate of induction of such genes is a product of enhancer and promoter activity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib85">Vo Ngoc et al., 2017</xref>) but can also be influenced by the previous experiences of the cells. A number of genes from yeast, flies, worms, mammals, and plants are more strongly induced following a previous exposure to a stimulus, and this primed state can persist for 4–14 mitotic cell divisions (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Brickner et al., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">D’Urso et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Gialitakis et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib49">Lämke and Bäurle, 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib53">Light et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib52">Light et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib58">Maxwell et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib67">Pascual-Garcia et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib79">Siwek et al., 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib81">Sood and Brickner, 2017</xref>). Because only a subset of genes induced under a particular condition exhibits memory (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib53">Light et al., 2013</xref>), this can also result in a qualitative change in the global expression pattern.</p><p>Although transcriptional memory in different organisms or for different genes has unique features, several common, conserved mechanisms have been identified. For example, in budding yeast, flies, and mammals, transcriptional memory requires the nuclear pore protein Nup98 (homologous to Nup100 in yeast). This protein physically interacts with the promoters of genes that exhibit memory and loss of Nup98/Nup100 disrupts memory (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib53">Light et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib52">Light et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib67">Pascual-Garcia et al., 2017</xref>). The interaction with Nup98 with chromatin in flies and mammals can occur away from the nuclear pore complex (NPC; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Capelson et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib43">Kalverda et al., 2010</xref>). However, during memory, the interaction of promoters with Nup98/Nup100 in both yeast and flies occurs at the pore.</p><p>Transcriptional memory is also associated with local changes in chromatin modifications and chromosome folding. In <italic>Drosophila</italic>, memory induced by ecdysone involves a long-distance promoter-enhancer interaction that is strengthened/stabilized by Nup98 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib67">Pascual-Garcia et al., 2017</xref>). In yeast, plants, and human cells, histone modifications of the promoter are required for memory: histone H3 lysine 4 dimethylation(H3K4me2) is generally associated with memory in yeast and humans (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">D’Urso et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Gialitakis et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib53">Light et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib52">Light et al., 2010</xref>), while in plants, several forms of epigenetic memory are associated with either H3K4me2 or H3K4me3 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib49">Lämke and Bäurle, 2017</xref>). In flies and mammals, Nup98 physically interacts with the H3K4 methyltransferases Trx and Set1A/COMPASS, respectively (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Franks et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib66">Pascual-Garcia et al., 2014</xref>). Nup98/Nup100 is required for memory-associated H3K4me2 in yeast and mammals, and conditional inactivation of either COMPASS (the methyltransferase) or SET3C (a histone deacetylase complex that binds H3K4me2; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib44">Kim and Buratowski, 2009</xref>) leads to rapid loss of memory in yeast (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">D’Urso et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib53">Light et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib52">Light et al., 2010</xref>). Likewise, substitution of alanine or arginine for lysine 4 on histone H3 (H3 K4R or K4A) disrupts <italic>INO1</italic> transcriptional memory (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">D’Urso et al., 2016</xref>). Importantly, the H3K4me2 during memory in yeast is carried out by a form of COMPASS that lacks the Spp1 subunit (Spp1<sup>-</sup> COMPASS), preventing trimethylation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">D’Urso et al., 2016</xref>).</p><p>Finally, transcriptional memory in yeast and mammals leads to binding of a poised RNA polymerase II (RNAPII) pre-initiation complex (PIC; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">D’Urso et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib53">Light et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib52">Light et al., 2010</xref>). A similar phenomenon, called RNAPII ‘docking,’ has been reported in <italic>Caenorhabditis elegans</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib58">Maxwell et al., 2014</xref>). Work from yeast suggests that this poised RNAPII PIC is distinct from active RNAPII PIC in two ways. First, it fails to recruit Cdk7 (Kin28 in budding yeast), the kinase that phosphorylates serine 5 on the RNAPII carboxy terminal domain upon initiation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">D’Urso et al., 2016</xref>). Second, it remains associated with Mediator kinase Cdk8 (Ssn3 in budding yeast; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">D’Urso et al., 2016</xref>). Cdk8 is also associated with poised promoters in HeLa cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">D’Urso et al., 2016</xref>) and has been found to regulate initiation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Akoulitchev et al., 2000</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib70">Pavri et al., 2005</xref>), suggesting that it plays a conserved role in transcriptional poising. Conditional depletion of yeast Ssn3 from the nucleus leads to loss RNAPII binding from the <italic>INO1</italic> promoter during memory and a defect in the rate of <italic>INO1</italic> reactivation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">D’Urso et al., 2016</xref>). Therefore, transcriptional memory is a conserved phenomenon that may involve a conserved core mechanism.</p><p>The highly inducible budding yeast gene <italic>INO1</italic> has served as a model for epigenetic transcriptional memory. <italic>INO1</italic> is an essential enzyme that catalyzes the conversion of glucose to <italic>myo</italic>-inositol for the biosynthesis of phosphatidylinositol. Our current understanding of <italic>INO1</italic> memory is summarized in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1A</xref>. Repressed <italic>INO1</italic> localizes in the nucleoplasm. Upon activation, the gene repositions to the nuclear periphery through interaction with the NPC (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Ahmed et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Brickner and Walter, 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib83">Sumner et al., 2021</xref>). Interaction of active <italic>INO1</italic> with the NPC requires two transcription factors, Put3 and Cbf1, that bind to the upstream DNA zip codes GRSI and GRSII (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1A</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Ahmed et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Brickner and Walter, 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib73">Randise-Hinchliff et al., 2016</xref>). Upon repression, recently repressed <italic>INO1</italic> acquires memory-specific chromatin marks, poised RNAPII PIC, and associates with the NPC by another mechanism (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Brickner et al., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib53">Light et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib52">Light et al., 2010</xref>). Whereas nucleosomes in the promoter and 5’ end of active <italic>INO1</italic> are hyper-acetylated and show both H3K4me2 and H3K4me3; the nucleosomes at the 5’ end of recently repressed <italic>INO1</italic> are hypo-acetylated and show only H3K4me2 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">D’Urso et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib53">Light et al., 2013</xref>). Also, the histone variant H2A.Z is incorporated into an upstream nucleosome during <italic>INO1</italic> memory (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Brickner et al., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib52">Light et al., 2010</xref>). The interaction with the NPC requires the Sfl1 transcription factor, the memory recruitment sequence (MRS) DNA zip code to which Sfl1 binds, and the nuclear pore protein Nup100 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">D’Urso et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib53">Light et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib52">Light et al., 2010</xref>). Loss of Nup100 or Sfl1, or mutations in the MRS, disrupt <italic>INO1</italic> localization to the nuclear periphery, cause loss of H3K4me2, H2A.Z and RNAPII binding, and slow the rate of reactivation of <italic>INO1</italic> without affecting repression or activation. <italic>INO1</italic> memory, as monitored by gene positioning, histone modification or RNAPII binding, is both maintained in mother cells and inherited to daughter cells through up to four mitotic divisions before being lost (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Brickner et al., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">D’Urso et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib52">Light et al., 2010</xref>).</p><fig-group><fig id="fig1" position="float"><label>Figure 1.</label><caption><title><italic>INO1</italic> transcriptional memory stimulates faster transcription and provides a competitive fitness advantage.</title><p>(<bold>A</bold>) Model of <italic>INO1</italic> in the active, memory, and long-term repressed states, highlighting factors that are specifically required for memory.

First, although transcription rates are impacted by memory, how it impacts fitness has not been generally assessed. We find that inositol memory provides a competitive fitness advantage during inositol starvation that is Nup100-, Cdk8-, and H3K4me2-dependent. Second, we assessed the function of H3K4me2 during memory. Sfl1 is required for H3K4 dimethylation, and H3K4me2 is essential for both Sfl1 binding and for RNAPII recruitment during <italic>INO1</italic> memory, suggesting that memory involves a chromatin-dependent positive feedback loop. Third, we define ways in which the dimethylation of H3K4 during transcription is different from dimethylation of H3K4 during memory. While transcription-associated H3K4 methylation is RNAPII-dependent, memory-associated H3K4me2 is RNAPII-independent and requires both overlapping and distinct factors. Finally, we explore the molecular mechanism of epigenetic inheritance of <italic>INO1</italic> memory. We rule out that protein production during inositol starvation promotes memory and instead highlight the critical role of heritable H3K4me2. Although establishing H3K4me2 during memory requires Sfl1, once established, H3K4me2 is maintained and inherited through ~4 cell divisions in the absence of Sfl1. A putative reader of H3K4me2 (SET3C) that is essential for this inheritance physically interacts with the writer of H3K4me2 (COMPASS), suggesting a molecular mechanism by which H3K4me2 is inherited during DNA replication. This work provides a compelling example of a heritable histone modification that stimulates future transcription and is inherited over a shorter timescale than other heritable histone modifications like H3K9 or H3K27 methylation.</p></sec><sec id="s2" sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><sec id="s2-1"><title>Epigenetic transcriptional memory of inositol starvation stimulates faster transcription and promotes competitive fitness</title><p>Factors that are specifically required for <italic>INO1</italic> memory stimulate faster reactivation. For example, while the rate of <italic>INO1</italic> activation (+inositol → −inositol) is unaffected by mutations in the MRS, the rate of <italic>INO1</italic> reactivation (−inositol →+inositol, 3 hr → −inositol) is clearly decreased by such mutations (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1B</xref>). Thus, Sfl1 binding to the MRS is important for enhancing the rate of <italic>INO1</italic> reactivation and has no role in <italic>INO1</italic> activation. However, this experiment highlights a paradox: although poised RNAPII PIC is associated with the recently repressed <italic>INO1</italic> promoter prior to reactivation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">D’Urso et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib52">Light et al., 2010</xref>), the rate of reactivation is not obviously faster than the rate of activation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1B</xref>). This has led to the suggestion that <italic>INO1</italic> does not exhibit transcriptional memory (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">Halley et al., 2010</xref>). However, it is also possible that the rate at which inositol starvation is perceived might be affected by previous expression of Ino1, leading to a reactivation-specific delay that obscures the effect of memory.</p><p>In the presence of inositol, <italic>INO1</italic> transcription is repressed by the combined action of the repressors Opi1 and Ume6 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Graves and Henry, 2000</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib41">Jackson and Lopes, 1996</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib89">White et al., 1991</xref>); loss of either of these proteins leads to constitutive, high-level expression of <italic>INO1</italic>. Depletion of inositol from the medium slows the rate of phosphatidylinositol biosynthesis, leading to an accumulation of the precursor, phosphatidic acid, which directly binds to and inhibits Opi1 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib55">Loewen et al., 2004</xref>). Inhibition of Opi1 leads to its dissociation from the promoter, export from the nucleus, and activation of <italic>INO1</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Brickner and Walter, 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib55">Loewen et al., 2004</xref>). In cells that have recently expressed Ino1, the extracellular inositol and the inositol produced by Ino1 may exceed that in cells that have not recently expressed Ino1, making them resistant to inositol starvation and delaying the accumulation of phosphatidic acid. To avoid this possible complication, we induced <italic>INO1</italic> transcription by removing Opi1 from the nucleus using the Anchor-Away method (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">Haruki et al., 2008</xref>), either in cells that were grown continuously in the presence of inositol (i.e. activation) or in cells that were grown overnight in the absence of inositol and then shifted into medium containing inositol for 3 hr (i.e. reactivation; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1C</xref>). By removing Opi1 from the nucleus in the presence of inositol, this approach should bypass any insensitivity to inositol starvation, allowing us to directly compare the rate of activation to the rate of reactivation. Upon Anchor Away of Opi1, reactivation was faster than activation, and this effect was lost in both <italic>mrs</italic> and <italic>nup100∆</italic> mutant cells, confirming that it requires the interaction with the NPC (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1D</xref>, middle and right panels). Therefore, <italic>INO1</italic> transcriptional memory enhances the rate of transcriptional reactivation.</p><p>We next asked if inositol memory promoted competitive fitness by competing pairs of strains with nearly identical plasmids integrated into the genome, differing at a single nucleotide (see Materials and methods). The abundance of each strain was quantified by PCR amplification and Sanger sequencing of a segment encompassing the SNP (either A or C; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1E</xref>). Mixing strains in various ratios confirmed that this assay is quantitative and accurate over a large dynamic range (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1F</xref>). Using this assay, we found that, during the initial 3 hr of inositol starvation, cells with inositol memory are more fit than cells experiencing inositol starvation for the first time (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1G</xref>). Importantly, this fitness benefit is dependent upon Nup100 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1G</xref>). Because <italic>INO1</italic> reactivation is not obviously faster than activation under these conditions, this fitness difference may be due to either more uniform expression of <italic>INO1</italic> among cells in the population, similar to other types of transcriptional memory (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib81">Sood and Brickner, 2017</xref>).</p><p>Alternatively, fitness may reflect the rate of reactivation of multiple inositol-regulated genes, including <italic>INO1</italic>. Consistent with this idea, we find that <italic>CHO1</italic>, a gene encoding phosphatidyl serine synthase that is also repressed by inositol exhibits all of the hallmarks of transcriptional memory. The <italic>CHO1</italic> locus was tagged with an array of ~128 Lac repressor binding sites in a strain expressing LacI-GFP and the ER (endoplasmic reticulum) membrane marker Pho88-mCherry to localize this gene within a population of live cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib75">Robinett et al., 1996</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib82">Straight et al., 1996</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">D’Urso et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Egecioglu et al., 2014</xref>). The percentage of cells in which <italic>CHO1</italic> colocalized with Pho88-mCherry at the nuclear periphery was quantified (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1A</xref>). Based on the size of the yeast nucleus, we expect a randomly positioned gene to colocalize with the nuclear envelope in ~27% of cells (blue dashed line; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Brickner et al., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Brickner and Walter, 2004</xref>). Following repression, <italic>CHO1</italic> showed Nup100-dependent peripheral localization for at least 3 hr (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1A</xref>). Also, chromatin immunoprecipitation (ChIP) showed both H3K4me2 and RNAPII associated with the <italic>CHO1</italic> promoter 3 hr after repression (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1B</xref>). Finally, <italic>CHO1</italic> showed faster reactivation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1C</xref>). This protein is required for growth in the absence of inositol (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Atkinson et al., 1980</xref>). Therefore, inositol memory impacts <italic>INO1</italic>, <italic>CHO1,</italic> and potentially other genes, suggesting that the fitness benefit associated with inositol memory is due to the coordinated, enhanced rate of reactivation of a set of genes that promote adaptation to inositol starvation.</p><p>Some forms of memory either require transcription during the initial stimulus or reflect the slow dilution of proteins that are expressed in activating conditions (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib48">Kundu and Peterson, 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib81">Sood and Brickner, 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib92">Zacharioudakis et al., 2007</xref>). Other forms of memory do not require previous transcription (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib68">Pascual-Garcia et al., 2022</xref>). Therefore, we tested if transcription is required to induce <italic>INO1</italic> memory. First, we determined how long cells need to be starved for inositol to induce <italic>INO1</italic> memory based on its retention at the nuclear periphery. As little as 10 min of inositol starvation resulted in Nup100-dependent peripheral localization 3 hr after shifting back to +inositol (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s2">Figure 1—figure supplement 2A</xref>). This is well before significant transcription has been induced (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1B</xref>). Using a temperature-sensitive mutation in the large subunit of RNAPII (<italic>rpb1-1</italic>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib65">Nonet et al., 1987</xref>), we find that inactivating RNAPII during inositol starvation did not affect retention of <italic>INO1</italic> at the nuclear periphery after repression (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s2">Figure 1—figure supplement 2B</xref>). Finally, to test if transcription is required in cis, we introduced mutations in the TATA box of <italic>INO1</italic>. This mutation blocks <italic>INO1</italic> transcription and leads to an Ino<sup>-</sup> phenotype (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s2">Figure 1—figure supplement 2C</xref>). However, localization of <italic>INO1</italic> at the nuclear periphery under either activating or memory conditions was unaffected by mutation of the TATA box (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s2">Figure 1—figure supplement 2D</xref>). Therefore, neither transcription of a <italic>trans</italic>-acting factor nor transcription of <italic>INO1</italic> is required for localization at the nuclear periphery during memory. This suggests that <italic>cis</italic>-acting molecular changes associated with the early moments of transcriptional activation induce <italic>INO1</italic> transcriptional memory.</p><p><italic>INO1</italic> memory persists through ~4 cell divisions (6–8 hr; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Brickner et al., 2007</xref>). This duration could reflect either the dilution and degradation of proteins over time or imperfect fidelity of inheritance following DNA replication. To shed light on this, we asked if memory could be extended significantly by arresting/slowing the cell cycle. Indeed, treatment with nocodazole extended <italic>INO1</italic> memory beyond 18 hr (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1</xref>). While dilution is also inhibited by arresting cell division, it seems unlikely that protein production and dilution explain the duration of memory because transcription during inositol starvation is not required. This supports a model in which the duration of memory is regulated by the number of cell divisions or replication cycles.</p></sec><sec id="s2-2"><title>A positive feedback loop promotes <italic>INO1</italic> transcriptional memory</title><p>To confirm that Opi1 Anchor Away is dependent on the chromatin modifications associated with <italic>INO1</italic> memory, we compared the rate of <italic>INO1</italic> activation and reactivation upon Opi1 Anchor Away in a <italic>set1∆</italic> strain lacking the catalytic subunit responsible for H3K4 methylation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2A</xref>).

ChIP in wild type (WT) cells reveals that H3K4me2 is observed under activating and memory conditions (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2C</xref>), while H2A.Z upstream of the TSS is only observed during memory (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2C</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib52">Light et al., 2010</xref>). The Sfl1 TF binds to the <italic>INO1</italic> promoter specifically during memory, requires the MRS DNA zip code, and is both necessary and sufficient to induce Nup100-dependent peripheral localization (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">D’Urso et al., 2016</xref>). In strains lacking either Nup100 or Sfl1, H3K4me2 is lost during memory (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2C</xref>) and the rate of reactivation is slowed (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1D</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">D’Urso et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib52">Light et al., 2010</xref>). Furthermore, H3K4me2 is rapidly lost in the <italic>nup100∆</italic> strain upon shifting from activating to repressing conditions (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2D</xref>). Likewise, incorporation of H2A.Z during memory also requires Sfl1 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2E</xref>), as has been seen for Nup100 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib52">Light et al., 2010</xref>). Thus, the interaction with the NPC stimulates both H3K4me2 and H2A.Z incorporation during <italic>INO1</italic> memory (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2E</xref>, left).</p><p>To explore how chromatin modifications impact each other, we performed ChIP against H2A.Z in a strain lacking Set3, a structural subunit of the SET3C histone deacetylase that binds H3K4me2 and is essential for maintaining H3K4me2 during memory (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">D’Urso et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib44">Kim and Buratowski, 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib53">Light et al., 2013</xref>). Strains lacking Set3 also failed to incorporate H2A.Z during <italic>INO1</italic> memory, suggesting that H2A.Z incorporation requires Sfl1/Nup100 and H3K4me2. Because H3K4me2 during memory does not require H2A.Z (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib53">Light et al., 2013</xref>), this suggests a hierarchical relationship between dimethylation of H3K4 and incorporation of H2A.Z (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2F</xref>).</p><p>Finally, we asked if Sfl1 binding to the <italic>INO1</italic> promoter during memory requires either interaction with the NPC or chromatin modifications. Surprisingly, loss of Nup100, Set3, or Swr1 (the catalytic subunit of the SWR complex, which incorporates H2A.Z into chromatin; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib59">Mizuguchi et al., 2004</xref>) disrupted binding of Sfl1 to the <italic>INO1</italic> promoter during memory (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2G</xref>). In other words, while Sfl1 is required for interaction of the <italic>INO1</italic> gene with the NPC and chromatin modifications, Nup100 and chromatin modification are also required for Sfl1 binding to the <italic>INO1</italic> promoter. We confirmed this dependence on H3K4me2 by conditional inactivation of COMPASS (the histone methyltransferase) using Anchor Away of Swd1 after establishing memory (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">D’Urso et al., 2016</xref>). Removing COMPASS from the nucleus leads to loss of H3K4me2 over the <italic>INO1</italic> promoter within ~60 min (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">D’Urso et al., 2016</xref>). In cells that have established memory, Sfl1 was bound to the <italic>INO1</italic> promoter (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2H</xref>, t=0), but upon Anchor Away of COMPASS, Sfl1 binding was lost rapidly (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2H</xref>). Thus, Sfl1 binding to the <italic>INO1</italic> promoter during memory requires H3K4me2 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2I</xref>). Together, these data suggest that <italic>INO1</italic> memory involves positive feedback between Sfl1-dependent interaction with the NPC and NPC-dependent H3K4me2 and H2A.Z incorporation.</p></sec><sec id="s2-3"><title>Two Heat Shock Factor-related transcription factors are required for <italic>INO1</italic> transcriptional memory</title><p>The MRS DNA zip code (5’-TCCTTCTTTCCC-3’; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib52">Light et al., 2010</xref>) contains sequences reminiscent of the trinucleotide repeats within heat shock elements (5’-TTC-3’). This aided in the identification of Sfl1, which possesses an Hsf1-like DNA binding domain (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">D’Urso et al., 2016</xref>). In budding yeast, there are three other TFs with similar DNA binding domains (Hms2, Mga1, and Skn7), which we also tested for a role in <italic>INO1</italic> memory (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s1">Figure 3—figure supplement 1</xref>). Of these proteins, only Hms2 was required for localization of <italic>INO1</italic> at the nuclear periphery during memory (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s1">Figure 3—figure supplement 1</xref>). Loss of Mga1 resulted in constitutive <italic>INO1</italic> localization at the periphery, while loss of Skn7 had no effect (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s1">Figure 3—figure supplement 1</xref>).

This suggests that Hms2 binds to the MRS both before and after establishing memory. Under activating conditions, loss of Hms2 did not affect RNAPII binding or methylation of H3K4, but during memory, loss of Hms2 led to loss of both (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3B</xref>). Furthermore, loss of Hms2 led to a specific decrease in the rate of reactivation upon Opi1 Anchor Away (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3C</xref>).

Introduction of a single copy of this 11-base pair element near the <italic>URA3</italic> locus (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6E</xref>, top) recapitulates important aspects of transcriptional memory: peripheral localization, H3K4me2, and H2A.Z incorporation, but not RNAPII binding (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib53">Light et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib52">Light et al., 2010</xref>). We have interpreted this to suggest that interaction of the NPC is sufficient to induce the chromatin changes associated with memory, but that recruitment of RNAPII requires <italic>cis</italic> acting promoter elements (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">D’Urso et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib53">Light et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib52">Light et al., 2010</xref>).

Such phenomena often require histone modifications, sometimes called epigenetic marks. However, histone modifications are generally regulated by sequence-specific DNA binding proteins that interact with <italic>cis</italic>-acting, genetically encoded DNA elements (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">Holoch et al., 2021</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">Holoch and Moazed, 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib50">Laprell et al., 2017</xref>). Thus, signal transduction that alters the activity of a TF can produce a heritable change in phenotype that requires histone modifications without the histone modification itself being heritable. Unlike DNA methylation, in which the methyl marks retained on one strand after replication serve to stimulate methylation of the other (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Edwards et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">Hermann et al., 2004</xref>), histone/nucleosome modifications are not necessarily re-incorporated at the same location after DNA replication (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Escobar et al., 2021</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib88">Wang et al., 2009</xref>).

Furthermore, elegant proximity labeling studies show that nucleosomes at certain silent loci are re-incorporated locally after DNA replication (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Escobar et al., 2019</xref>). Thus, mitotic inheritance requires both the local reincorporation of marked nucleosomes and reinforcement of these modifications through covalent modification of unmarked nucleosomes following DNA replication. The histone marks for which there is the clearest data for heritability share several features: (1) they tend to occur over large regions, encompassing many nucleosomes, (2) they are associated with transcriptional repression, and (3) inheritance requires an interaction between a writer and a reader that recruits or stimulates the writer.</p><p>Here we find that H3K4 dimethylation of nucleosomes over the same location in the genome can either be stable and heritable or unstable and rapidly removed, depending on the mechanism by which it is deposited.

In contrast, during memory, histone acetylation and H3K4me3 are lost and H3K4me2 is deposited (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6C</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">D’Urso et al., 2016</xref>). This mechanism of H3K4 dimethylation during memory is mechanistically distinct from that observed during transcription: it is catalyzed by Spp1<sup>-</sup> COMPASS, does not require RNAPII and requires SET3C, Leo1, Sfl1, and Nup100 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">D’Urso et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib53">Light et al., 2013</xref>). Critically, once established, H3K4me2 is both stable and inherited for ~4 cell divisions following degradation of Sfl1 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6</xref>). This is distinct from the effects of inactivating COMPASS or SET3C (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figures 4</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">6</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">D’Urso et al., 2016</xref>). Therefore, H3K4me2 can be maintained and inherited in the absence of an essential initiating factor but continuously requires the writer and reader. We conclude that, as with histone marks associated with heterochromatin (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib74">Reinberg and Vales, 2018</xref>), a histone mark associated with transcriptional poising is epigenetically inherited.</p><p>How is heritable H3K4me2 distinguished from unstable H3K4me2? It is possible that the heritable signal comprises H3K4me2 and additional histone marks. Although the incorporation of H2A.Z during memory is an intriguing possibility for a second signal, it is not essential for H3K4 dimethylation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib53">Light et al., 2013</xref>). Alternatively, unacetylated histones may stimulate heritable H3K4 dimethylation, perhaps by regulating the activity of Spp1<sup>-</sup> COMPASS or the Paf complex via Leo1. This may explain why the SET3C histone deacetylase is the reader for this mark.</p><p>Whereas H3K9 methylation or H3K27 methylation is generally very stable and state switching promotes long-term or permanent switches, transcriptional memory persists for shorter timescales, generally between 4 and 14 mitotic divisions. This limited inheritance may reflect a balance between the fitness benefits of memory and its costs in a fluctuating environment. Regardless, our current understanding suggests that the duration of memory relates to limits on inheritance following each round of DNA replication. Whereas H3K9 methylation or H3K27 methylation generally covers tens to hundreds of thousands of base pairs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Barski et al., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Cutter DiPiazza et al., 2021</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib69">Pauler et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib90">Yu et al., 2014</xref>), the chromatin changes associated with epigenetic transcriptional memory are more local, covering hundreds of base pairs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">D’Urso et al., 2016</xref>). Following DNA replication, nucleosomes are randomly segregated into the two daughter molecules (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib71">Petryk et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib91">Yu et al., 2018</xref>). Approximately half of the nucleosomes should retain regulatory marks and the inheritance of those marks requires recognizing these nucleosomes and modifying adjacent, unmarked nucleosomes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Escobar et al., 2021</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib56">Loyola et al., 2006</xref>). If recognition and/or modification is imperfect, the efficiency of such an inheritance mechanism should increase with the number of nucleosomes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Cutter DiPiazza et al., 2021</xref>). If so, then the duration of memory could be limited by a combination of the number of modified nucleosomes, the fidelity, and efficiency of the reader-writer system and the regulation of the initiating transcription factors.</p><p>Our current model for <italic>INO1</italic> transcriptional memory is shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7</xref>. When active, <italic>INO1</italic> interacts with the NPC through upstream DNA zip codes and the TFs Put3 and Cbf1. Two TFs essential for transcription, Ino2 and Ino4, bind to two UAS<sub>INO</sub> elements that flank the MRS. These TFs recruit co-activators, including histone acetyltransferases like SAGA. Hms2 binds the MRS but has no known role in localization or transcription of active <italic>INO1</italic>. RNAPII recruits the Paf1C and COMPASS, leading to H3K4me3 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7A</xref>).</p><fig id="fig7" position="float"><label>Figure 7.</label><caption><title>Models for <italic>INO1</italic> transcriptional memory.</title><p>(<bold>A</bold>). <italic>INO1</italic> under activating conditions. Interaction with the nuclear pore complex (NPC) is mediated by Put3 (and, potentially, Cbf1; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Ahmed et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib73">Randise-Hinchliff et al., 2016</xref>). Ino2/Ino4 heterodimers bind UAS<sub>INO</sub> elements flanking the memory recruitment sequence (MRS) and recruit coactivators such as Mediator to promote RNA polymerase II (RNAPII) recruitment and transcription. Hms2 binds to the MRS element but does not contribute to <italic>INO1</italic> transcription or localization. (<bold>B</bold>) Upon repression, <italic>INO1</italic> transcriptional memory is established by Hms2-dependent recruitment of Sfl1, leading to Nup100-dependent interaction with the NPC. Nup100, Sfl1, and Hms2 are required for both Spp1<sup>-</sup> COMPASS-dependent H3K4 dimethylation and H2A.Z incorporation near the MRS. SET3C associates with H3K4me2 and is required for its persistence. (<bold>C</bold>) During memory, Cdk8<sup>+</sup> Mediator is recruited to the <italic>INO1</italic> promoter.

Following DNA replication, only half of the nucleosomes bear H3K4me2. SET3C recognizes the H3K4me2-marked nucleosomes and recruits Spp1<sup>-</sup> COMPASS, which methylates adjacent nucleosomes. In the presence of Sfl1/Hms2, this re-establishment will likely emanate from the MRS outwards.</p></caption><graphic mime-subtype="tiff" mimetype="image" xlink:href="elife-77646-fig7-v2.tif"/></fig><p>Upon repression, the Opi1 repressor binds to Ino2 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Brickner and Walter, 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">Heyken et al., 2005</xref>), repressing transcription by recruiting the Rpd3L histone deacetylase (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib42">Kadosh and Struhl, 1997</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib73">Randise-Hinchliff et al., 2016</xref>). To establish memory, Hms2 facilitates recruitment of Sfl1 to the MRS and Nup100-dependent interaction with the NPC (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7</xref>). Because Nup98 physically interacts with the H3K4 methyltransferases Trithorax in flies (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib66">Pascual-Garcia et al., 2014</xref>) and MLL in mammals (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Franks et al., 2017</xref>), we envision that Nup100 helps recruit Spp1<sup>-</sup> COMPASS to dimethylate H3K4 and establish memory (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7</xref>). To-date, we have not observed co-immunoprecipitation of Nup100 with COMPASS (not shown). However, it is possible that Sfl1, Hms2, or Nup100 compete with Spp1 for binding to COMPASS to ensure this switch. Alternatively, these proteins may recruit Paf1C and COMPASS through interaction with Leo1.</p><p>Importantly, the H3K4me2 mark is required for both Sfl1 binding and H2A.Z incorporation during memory, forming a positive feedback loop between interaction with the NPC and chromatin changes. Because the MRS at an ectopic site is sufficient to induce chromatin changes without recruiting RNAPII (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib53">Light et al., 2013</xref>) or Mediator (our unpublished results), <italic>cis-</italic>acting promoter elements presumably facilitate RNAPII recruitment. We hypothesize that Ino2/Ino4 collaborate with Sfl1/Hms2 to recruit Cdk8<sup>+</sup> Mediator, which is essential for RNAPII poising (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7</xref>). This would explain why loss of H3K4 methylation leads to loss of Sfl1 binding, peripheral localization, and RNAPII.</p><p>Following DNA replication, we proposed that inheritance requires methylation of unmodified H3K4 on nucleosomes near those that were previously modified (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib60">Moazed, 2011</xref>). This pathway would involve recognition of the H3K4me2 mark on reincorporated nucleosomes by SET3C, recruitment of Spp1<sup>-</sup> COMPASS, and dimethylation of H3K4 on adjacent nucleosomes. Once the <italic>INO1</italic> promoter nucleosomes are methylated, Sfl1/Hms2 can bind, mediating interaction with the NPC and re-establishing memory. Loss of Leo1 seems to both weaken the interaction between COMPASS and SET3C and to disrupt persistence/inheritance of <italic>INO1</italic> memory, suggesting that it facilitates Spp1<sup>-</sup> COMPASS recruitment after DNA replication.</p><p>Do all genes that exhibit transcriptional memory utilize the same molecular mechanism? No. Several of the molecules required for <italic>INO1</italic> memory are not generally involved in memory, such as Sfl1 and Hms2 (our unpublished data). However, <italic>INO1</italic> epigenetic memory has also identified factors and mechanisms that are implicated in memory more generally and suggest a core, conserved, epigenetic poising mechanism. For example, Nup100-dependent interaction with the NPC is associated with transcriptional memory of several yeast genes and Nup98 plays an essential role in both interferon gamma memory in HeLa cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib52">Light et al., 2010</xref>) and in ecdysone memory in flies (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Gozalo et al., 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib67">Pascual-Garcia et al., 2017</xref>). In yeast and mammals, memory leads to H3K4me2, RNAPII binding, and Cdk8 association (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">D’Urso et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib53">Light et al., 2013</xref>). Therefore, many genes from yeast to mammals employ a common transcriptional poising mechanism. What selects which genes exhibit memory? Many yeast TFs can mediate Nup100-dependent interaction with the NPC (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Brickner et al., 2019</xref>). Therefore, different stimuli may induce memory through regulating the activity of these TFs to induce memory in different subsets of genes. Diverse, transient signals could be interpreted through TFs to alter future fitness in distinct ways for several generations.</p></sec><sec id="s4" sec-type="materials|methods"><title>Materials and methods</title><sec id="s4-1"><title>Yeast strains</title><p>Yeast strains used in this study are listed in <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="supp1">Supplementary file 1</xref>.

positive feedback loop exists between Sfl1-dependent interaction with the nuclear pore complex and H3K4me2 deposition in the INO1 promoter, which is essential for recruitment of poised Pol II, but which does not require transcription initiation to occur. This distinguishes this activity of COMPASS from its conventional role in H3K4 methylation that is dependent on transcription. The Pol II-independent mechanism was also shown to require Nup100, SET3C, and the Leo1 subunit of the Paf1 complex. It is further noteworthy that this specialized H3K4me2 deposition can persist through multiple cell cycles, in a manner that appears to be enhanced by physical association between the writer of this mark, the memory-specific form of COMPASS lacking subunit Spp1, and the reader SET3C, in the manner expected for epigenetic spreading of histone methylation.</p></body></sub-article><sub-article article-type="decision-letter" id="sa1"><front-stub><article-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.77646.sa1</article-id><title-group><article-title>Decision letter</article-title></title-group><contrib-group content-type="section"><contrib contrib-type="editor"><name><surname>Hinnebusch</surname><given-names>Alan G</given-names></name><role>Reviewing Editor</role><aff><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="ror">https://ror.org/04byxyr05</institution-id><institution>Eunice Kennedy Shriver National Institute of Child Health and Human Development</institution></institution-wrap><country>United States</country></aff></contrib></contrib-group></front-stub><body><boxed-text id="sa2-box1"><p>Our editorial process produces two outputs: (i) <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://sciety.org/articles/activity/10.1101/2022.02.11.480054">public reviews</ext-link> designed to be posted alongside <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://www.biorxiv.org/content/10.1101/2022.02.11.480054v1">the preprint</ext-link> for the benefit of readers; (ii) feedback on the manuscript for the authors, including requests for revisions, shown below.

At the same time, they each raised issues with certain experiments or interpretations that will likely require some additional experimental work, in addition to text revisions, to address, as follows:</p><p>1) Test whether deletion of SET1 or introducing the H3K4R substitution upon anchor away of Opi1 impairs memory, to eliminate an alternative model that Opi1 mediated repression is the primary driver of memory.</p><p>2) Try to clarify why nuclear depletion of Opi1 is required to observe that memory stimulates the rate of INO1 derepression during reactivation; and if this is not the case in cells containing Opi1, how can you account for the increased fitness conferred by memory in WT cells?</p><p>3) Provide additional qRT-PCR measurements of INO1 mRNA levels to confirm their changes in key TF mutants.

In Figure 1, the authors show that mutations in the TATA box of the INO1 promoter or mutations in the RNAP II Rbp1 subunit do not compromise transcriptional memory, demonstrating that transcription itself does not appear to be required for memory. However, the readout for memory here is localization of the tagged locus to the nuclear periphery. It would further solidify the authors' conclusions to assess additional transcriptional memory marks. Can authors show that H3K4Me2 or potentially other aspects like H2AZ incorporation also do not get affected?</p><p>2. The Leo1 finding is very interesting. To further corroborate their conclusions on the role of Leo1 in maintenance of memory and H3K4Me2, but not in its establishment, authors could assess the timing of recruitment of Leo1 to INO1 – does Leo1 get recruited later on in the memory process? Does it stay at the INO1 promoter as long as the H3K4me2 mark persists? Can it be detected at the ectopically inserted MRS element at the URA3 locus?</p><p>3. Sfl1 was found to act in the opposite manner to Leo1 – using varying times of Sfl1 degradation, authors show that it is required for establishment of H3K4Me2 during early memory but is dispensable for later maintenance. Does the other key factor of this process, Nup100, mediate establishment or maintenance or both? Can it be tested in similar time scales?</p><p><italic>Reviewer #3 (Recommendations for the authors):</italic></p><p>Overall summary of the manuscript</p><p>In general, I am very enthusiastic about the system, the anchor away approaches that are used to demonstrate that memory indeed is encoded in the INO1 re-activation process (Figure 1) and that there is a source of RNA polII independent H3K4me2 (Figure 6). These data are the strengths of this manuscript. I am less enthusiastic about some of the more incoherent aspects of the paper which includes conflating transcriptional memory with spatial relocalization (lacO based imaging), interpreting genetic interaction data as biochemical interactions, and finally a read-write model of H3K4me2 propagation. However, the data on a source of H3K4me2 that is transcription independent is compelling and what is particularly unique about the observation is the elegant genetics that makes it possible to capture its transient presence within the 'memory' paradigm. I am less convinced that these modifications themselves are required for re-activation, but I fully support such ideas being a part of the Discussion section. In general, strengthening the manuscript with additional data such as qRT-PCR experiments and removing claims of a read-write model for the propagation of H3K4me2 would make this manuscript a valuable addition to our understanding of the intriguing chromatin dependent processes that maintain epigenetic memory.</p><p>Specific comments</p><p>Related to Figure 1</p><p>The authors must consider experiments where -ino to +ino to -ino is performed using different delay times. The timepoint they are using for re-activation measurements are capturing H3K4me2 levels that are coincident with cells moving to the -ino condition. If this has been already done in an earlier study, it would be appropriate to discuss more carefully how they chose the 3-hour time point to investigate memory by returning cells to the -ino state. The data that would help their case is not the memory of spatial localization but supporting data in the form of either H3K4me2 ChIP-qPCR experiments or qRT-PCR measurements.</p><p>The Opi1 experiment is a very well thought and clearly the anchor away experiment reveals that the system does indeed exhibit stronger memory that is obscured by the repressive effects of Opi1. This is not a question about semantics but as presented, the authors seem to be looking at the loss of repression as opposed to faster re-activation. This is concerning since an alternative model emerges wherein the combination of activators and repressors (the authors highlighted ~ 6 of them- Cbf1, Put3, Sfi1, Opi1, Mga1, Hms2) could enable the types of persistent memory responses observed in their experiments. Discussing this as an alternative model would be helpful. A full mathematical model would be an appropriate next step but it is understandably outside the scope of this manuscript.</p><p>Error in labeling the memory scheme in Figure 1D (should be -ino1 based on the authors description in the text).</p><p>How do H3K4me2 levels changes in the Opi1 anchor away paradigm? This would be a vital addition to a revised version of their manuscript where the authors might reasonably expect an increase in H3K4me2 levels upon an increase in the magnitude of re-activation (or loss of repression).</p><p>In general, a major caveat to the authors interpretation is that there is no data mapping a quantitative relationship between the magnitude of re-activation and H3K4me2 levels although the Opi1 system represents an opportunity for such a measurement.</p><p>Have the authors tested set1 deletion or H3K4R strains in cells where they can anchor away Opi1? This would resolve the alternative model that Opi1 mediated repression primarily contributes to memory (or lack thereof). If re-activation (or memory) fails to be present this would support their model of an alternative transcription independent source of H3K4me2 being important.</p><p>In supplementary figure 1, the authors visualize the INO1 locus tethered to the nuclear periphery with nocodazole dependent inhibition of cell division. The authors claim ‘memory’ persists but I do not understand if the memory they refer to is the spatial relocalization (as their data supports) or transcriptional memory (as their data does not support).</p><p>Related to Figure 3</p><p>I was struck by the tradeoffs in binding and occupancy between the different TFs and think the data where different TFs have distinct effects on memory/activation is very interesting. However, this data once again compels me to ask the extent to which TF occupancy itself confers memory. How does the overexpression of Hms2 and Mga1 affect memory and re-activation?</p><p>While there is an impressive amount of panels of ChIP and imaging measurements, I am fundamentally missing a simple qRT-PCR measurement of INO1 RNA levels and how these levels are affected in the different TF deletion mutants. This is especially important in understanding the exact roles of Hms2 and/or Mga1 and the consequence of the increase RNA polII occupancy in ChIP measurements.</p><p>Related to Figure 4</p><p>Specifically Figure 4E is designed in a manner where one assumes that the authors are testing whether ssn3-AID (+auxin) and NaPP1 have an additive effect. It seems like they do not. In any event this experiment needs a control where the authors solely test the depletion of ssn3-AID (+auxin). If the effect isn’t additive how does this data affect their model and interpretations of the role of the paused RNA polII complex?</p><p>The results of the SPT15 depletion measurements are surprising. How is H3K4me2 present in the memory paradigm especially if it was absent during the activation phase? Perhaps one explanation (which I assume the authors favor) is that there is a transcription independent mechanism of H3K4me2 deposition. I am surprised by the fact that this pathway is as efficient as the transcription dependent one (comparing %IP levels). Either the authors are overestimating the effects, or it is a timing issue of when the authors choose to test re-activation? This conclusion as it relates to Figure 4C must be addressed with either additional experiments or a plausible explanation that accounts for the transcription independent pathway being as efficient as the transcription independent one.</p><p>Related to Figure 5</p><p>The authors discovered that Leo1 affects memory. While the spatial positioning of INO1 data exhibits memory, the authors must include qRT-PCR data given that memory associated with transcription and its correspondence with fitness are the centerpiece of this manuscript. This critique holds true for experiments in the Main and Supplementary Figures.</p><p>Related to Figure 6</p><p>Although I could infer the experimental details and the experimental design, I found figure 6A to be a very confusing schematic. It would be helpful to readers to revise this panel.</p><p>Figure 6B needs supporting qRT-PCR data to test how the timing of auxin addition affects INO1 expression.</p><p>Figure 6C (and Figure 1) are very compelling pieces of data and strongly argue for a transcription or at least an RNA polII independent mode of H3K4me2 deposition. This was surprising and I want to highlight that at least to this reviewer, it was a very exciting finding.</p><p>The coIP experiment as designed in Figure 6 provides a weak foundation to propose a read-write model of H3K4me2 propagation. The conceptual problem is that not all genes behave like INO1 as a result of which the coIP is unlikely to really reflect how complexes at one particular locus in the genome are changing. If the authors want to generalize their conclusions, there needs to be more genome wide data. Another possible way to address this (although it is a much weaker experiment) is to do the same coIP in different deletion backgrounds where cells exhibit the same phenotype as leo1 δ.</p><p>The authors also must show data with point mutants where &quot;reading&quot; activity has been impaired to preserve both complex stoichiometry and disable only its ability to autonomously propagate an epigenetic signal. In the absence of such data, the manuscript will be better served by removing said data from the manuscript and refocusing it on the novel source of H3K4me2 which is RNA polII independent but Nup100 (and other factors) dependent.</p><p>Other overall comments as it relates to the manuscript text</p><p>Examples where genetic interaction data is conflated with a biochemical model of protein-protein or protein-DNA interactions. This is a recurring theme in the manuscript. I think the genetic data is very compelling and the manuscript simply needs to express the results as such.</p><p>&quot;In other words while Sfi1 is required for the interaction with the NPC and chromatin modifications, interaction with the NPC and chromatin modification are also required for Sfi1 binding&quot;</p><p>&quot;Thus our current model is that Hms2 prevents Sfi1 binding to active INO1 promoter but is required for Sfi1 binding during memory, perhaps binding as a heterodimer&quot;</p><p>In all plots showing INO1/ACT1 mRNA:</p><p>y axis for qRT-PCR suggests absolute mRNA counts; should be relative abundance where the authors are in fact measuring a fold-change.</p></body></sub-article><sub-article article-type="reply" id="sa2"><front-stub><article-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.77646.sa2</article-id><title-group><article-title>Author response</article-title></title-group></front-stub><body><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Essential revisions:</p><p>The referees are in agreement that the paper is potentially a valuable contribution and that the finding of transcription independent deposition of H3K4me2 to establish memory, and its epigenetic inheritance, are both of great interest.

We have added the following to the Results section (along with Figure 1 – Supplement 2):</p><p>“Because INO1 reactivation is not obviously faster than activation under these conditions, it seems likely that the fitness difference is due to the rate of reactivation of multiple inositol-regulated genes, including INO1. Consistent with this idea, we find that CHO1 (encoding phosphatidyl serine synthase), which is also repressed by inositol, also shows sustained, Nup100-dependent peripheral localization for at least 3h after repression, H3K4me2 and RNAPII binding after repression and faster reactivation (Figure 1 – Supplement 2). This protein is required for growth in the absence of inositol (Atkinson et al., 1980). Therefore, inositol memory impacts other genes as well and the fitness difference is likely due to the coordinated, enhanced reactivation of a set of genes that promote adaptation to inositol starvation.”</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>3) Provide additional qRT-PCR measurements of INO1 mRNA levels to confirm their changes in key TF mutants. The experiment on deleting the TATA box in Figure 1 is a case in point, where only localization of Nup1 was examined.

Previous work has shown that sfl1∆ mutants show a defect in the rate of reactivation (D’Urso et al., 2016), which we highlight in the text. Also, we have now added qRT PCR for the hms2∆ strain activated or reactivated using the Opi1 Anchor Away (Figure 3C), confirming that Hms2 is required for faster reactivation in this system.</p><p>To confirm that previous transcription is not required for H3K4 methylation during memory, we performed ChIP against H3K4me2 and H3K4me3 in the wild type and tata mutant strains under repressing and memory conditions, as suggested. Consistent with the localization data, we find normal H3K4me2 under memory conditions in the tata mutant strain (Figure 4E).</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>4) The coIP experiment in Figure 6 does not provide compelling support for the read-write model of H3K4me2 propagation and is merely consistent with it.

Our data support a physical interaction between COMPASS and SET3C. While we believe this interaction is important for inheritance of inositol memory, as measured by H3K4me2 of the INO1 promoter, it is possible that it is also important for H3K4me2 at other sites around the genome under a variety of conditions. This may account for the prevalence of the interaction. If this were true, we would expect that the Spp1<sup>-</sup> form of COMPASS would specifically participate in this interaction. Consistent with this notion, we did not see CoIP with Set3 when the Spp1 subunit was tagged, instead of the Swd1 subunit (now included in Figure 6F).</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>5) Regarding this last point, it seems important to extend the analysis in Figure 6D to show that the persistence of H3K4me2 deposition following depletion of Sfl1 will be diminished in cells lacking Set3 to bolster the model that the proposed epigenetic inheritance of H3K4me2 requires Set3C as a reader of this histone mark.</p></disp-quote><p>Excellent suggestion. We have now included experiments in which we degraded either Sfl1-AID alone or Sfl1-AID and Set3-AID together and assessed the persistence of H3K4me2 over either the INO1 promoter or at URA3:MRS (Figure 6D and E). Remarkably, both loci showed the same efficiency of reincorporation of H3K4me2 and duration of inheritance when Sfl1 alone was degraded (~6-8h; Figure 6D and E). However, when both Sfl1 and Set3 were degraded, H3K4me2 was rapidly lost (Figure 6D and E).</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>6) It would enhance the scientific quality of the work if it was shown that Nup100 mediates establishment or maintenance of memory or both?</p></disp-quote><p>This is a worthwhile experiment that we have tried unsuccessfully. N-terminal and C-terminal AID alleles of Nup100 are neither perfectly functional nor efficiently degraded. Thus, we have not attempted to analyze them in the same way as we have for Sfl1 and Ssn3.</p><p>Because loss of Sfl1 leads to loss of peripheral localization (Figure 6B), it seems likely that Nup100 is critical for establishment of H3K4me2, but not essential for its inheritance through mitosis. To strengthen this connection, we now include additional characterization of the nup100∆ phenotype. ChIP against H3K4me2 over time after repression shows that, unlike the wild type strain in which we observe H3K4me2 for &gt; 6h after repression, H3K4me2 is lost within 1h in nup100∆ (Figure 2D), similar to the effect of this mutation on INO1 gene localization (Figure 3D).</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Reviewer #1 (Recommendations for the authors):</p><p>– Additional discussion is required to explain why nuclear depletion of Opi1 is required to observe that memory stimulates the rate of INO1 derepression during reactivation; and if this is not the case in WT cells, how can they account for the increased fitness conferred by memory?</p></disp-quote><p>First, we thank Reviewer 1 for their positive assessment of this work.</p><p>Related to the source of the fitness advantage of inositol memory, we have included additional text in the Results and in the Discussion regarding our model for the fitness advantage (described above).

This suggests that several genes may be more efficiently and coordinately upregulated during memory and that this promotes adaptation to inositol starvation.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>– It seems important to extend the analysis in Figure 6D to show that the persistence of H3K4me2 deposition following depletion of Sfl1 will be diminished in cells lacking Set3 to bolster the model that the proposed epigenetic inheritance of H3K4me2 requires Set3C as a reader of this histone mark.</p></disp-quote><p>We have degraded either Sfl1-AID alone or Sfl1-AID and Set3-AID together and assessed the persistence of H3K4me2 over either the INO1 promoter or at URA3:MRS (Figure 6D and E).

In Figure 1, the authors show that mutations in the TATA box of the INO1 promoter or mutations in the RNAP II Rbp1 subunit do not compromise transcriptional memory, demonstrating that transcription itself does not appear to be required for memory. However, the readout for memory here is localization of the tagged locus to the nuclear periphery. It would further solidify the authors' conclusions to assess additional transcriptional memory marks. Can authors show that H3K4Me2 or potentially other aspects like H2AZ incorporation also do not get affected?</p></disp-quote><p>We have included new data in Figure 4E showing that under memory conditions, the INO1 promoter in both the wild type and the tata mutant strains are marked by H3K4me2. This is not observed under repressing conditions and under nether condition is H3K4me3 observed, consistent with this mark being strictly associated with active transcription. Therefore, the H3K4 dimethylation observed under memory conditions is independent of previous transcription.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>2. The Leo1 finding is very interesting. To further corroborate their conclusions on the role of Leo1 in maintenance of memory and H3K4Me2, but not in its establishment, authors could assess the timing of recruitment of Leo1 to INO1 – does Leo1 get recruited later on in the memory process? Does it stay at the INO1 promoter as long as the H3K4me2 mark persists? Can it be detected at the ectopically inserted MRS element at the URA3 locus?</p></disp-quote><p>The Paf1C complex is required for all H3K4 methylation, suggesting that it is present whenever H3K4 methylation is observed, including during active transcription. Because Leo1 co-purifies with the Paf1C complex, we do not propose that the protein is binding only during memory or that Leo1 is functioning independently of the rest of the complex (Figure 7). Our current model is that Leo1 is present whenever we observe H3K4 methylation. However, we have not shown that it binds by ChIP.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>3. Sfl1 was found to act in the opposite manner to Leo1 – using varying times of Sfl1 degradation, authors show that it is required for establishment of H3K4Me2 during early memory but is dispensable for later maintenance. Does the other key factor of this process, Nup100, mediate establishment or maintenance or both? Can it be tested in similar time scales?</p></disp-quote><p>This is an excellent suggestion. However, our attempts to make conditional alleles of Nup100 have not been successful to-date. Both amino terminal and carboxyl terminal AID tags show both partial loss of function and are incompletely degraded upon addition of auxin. Therefore, we could not test the role of Nup100 in establishment vs inheritance. However, two observations suggest that Nup100, like Sfl1, is important for establishing H3K4me2 during memory, but not for its inheritance: (1) a null mutation in NUP100 leads to rapid loss of both H3K4me2 (Figure 2D), and peripheral localization (Figure 5E), suggesting a failure to establish memory, (this is distinct from the delayed defect observed in the leo1∆ mutant (Figure 5E)) and (2) degradation of Sfl1 leads to loss of peripheral localization (Figure 6), suggesting loss of the interaction with the nuclear pore complex, but does not lead to rapid loss of H3K4me2.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Reviewer #3 (Recommendations for the authors):</p><p>Specific comments</p><p>Related to Figure 1</p><p>The authors must consider experiments where -ino to +ino to -ino is performed using different delay times. The timepoint they are using for re-activation measurements are capturing H3K4me2 levels that are coincident with cells moving to the -ino condition. If this has been already done in an earlier study, it would be appropriate to discuss more carefully how they chose the 3-hour time point to investigate memory by returning cells to the -ino state. The data that would help their case is not the memory of spatial localization but supporting data in the form of either H3K4me2 ChIP-qPCR experiments or qRT-PCR measurements.</p></disp-quote><p>We apologize for any lack of clarity that led to confusion on our protocol. All of the ChIP experiments for H3K4me2 and RNAPII were performed after 3h of repression, the same moment when cells were shifted back to -ino medium in competition or qRT PCR experiments and the same time point at which rapamycin was added for the anchor away experiments. However, to confirm that H3K4me2 is associated with the full duration of memory, we performed ChIP in cells shifted to repressing conditions for 0-6h (Figure 2D). This experiment confirmed that, like INO1 localization (Brickner et al., 2007) and RNAPII binding (Light et al., 2013), H3K4me2 persists for &gt; 6h after transcription has been repressed.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>The Opi1 experiment is a very well thought and clearly the anchor away experiment reveals that the system does indeed exhibit stronger memory that is obscured by the repressive effects of Opi1. This is not a question about semantics but as presented, the authors seem to be looking at the loss of repression as opposed to faster re-activation. This is concerning since an alternative model emerges wherein the combination of activators and repressors (the authors highlighted ~ 6 of them- Cbf1, Put3, Sfi1, Opi1, Mga1, Hms2) could enable the types of persistent memory responses observed in their experiments. Discussing this as an alternative model would be helpful. A full mathematical model would be an appropriate next step but it is understandably outside the scope of this manuscript.</p></disp-quote><p>This is a good point and something we will consider in future studies. In Figure 7, we have attempted to summarize our current understanding as well as providing hypotheses to be tested in the future. Modeling may require a better molecular understanding of how these TFs are regulated and how they recruit critical co-factors. Sfl1 and Hms2 have poorly understood roles as activators and have also been described as repressors. Our current model is that they play a dual role in memory: both altering chromatin structure and facilitating recruitment of Cdk8<sup>+</sup> Mediator, perhaps in collaboration with Ino2/4. The outcome is a poised state that prevents both Opi1-mediated repression and active transcription. Consistent with this model, loss of upstream factors like Sfl1 and Hms2 leads to full Opi1 repression, while loss of Cdk8 kinase activity leads to loss of the poised RNAPII PIC, but maintenance of H3K4me2.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Error in labeling the memory scheme in Figure 1D (should be -ino1 based on the authors description in the text)</p></disp-quote><p>Actually, this label is correct.

The anchor away of Opi1 was only used during the final activation/reactivation time course. Prior to that, memory was established using exactly the same conditions we used throughout the rest of the paper: overnight growth in -inositol, followed by 3h of repression in +inositol. We have clarified this in the Results section with the following text:</p><p>“To avoid this possible complication, we induced INO1 transcription by removing Opi1 from the nucleus using the Anchor-Away method (Haruki et al., 2008), either in cells that were grown continuously in the presence of inositol (i.e. activation) or in cells that were grown overnight in the absence of inositol and then shifted into medium containing inositol for 3h (i.e. reactivation; Figure 1C).”</p><p>In other words, all of the ChIP experiments against H3K4me2 from non-anchor away strains represent the 0 minute time point for the anchor away experiments.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Have the authors tested set1 deletion or H3K4R strains in cells where they can anchor away Opi1? This would resolve the alternative model that Opi1 mediated repression primarily contributes to memory (or lack thereof). If re-activation (or memory) fails to be present this would support their model of an alternative transcription independent source of H3K4me2 being important.</p></disp-quote><p>We now include qRT PCR data for INO1 transcription upon Opi1 anchor away in the set1∆ mutant (Figure 2A), confirming that Set1 is essential for the faster reactivation of INO1 during memory.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>In supplementary figure 1, the authors visualize the INO1 locus tethered to the nuclear periphery with nocodazole dependent inhibition of cell division.

Given that interaction with Sfl1/Hms2 leads to Nup100dependent interaction with the NPC and that these factors are essential for chromatin modifications, binding of RNAPII and faster reactivation upon Opi1 anchor away, peripheral localization is a reasonable proxy for the other molecular events that promote transcriptional memory.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Related to Figure 3</p><p>I was struck by the tradeoffs in binding and occupancy between the different TFs and think the data where different TFs have distinct effects on memory/activation is very interesting.

However, we also performed the control of inhibiting Ssn3 without degrading Set3. If the reviewer is asking if inactivating Set3 alone has an effect, the answer is yes. D’Urso et al., (2016) showed that depletion of Set3 by anchor away leads to rapid loss of H3K4me2 during memory, but not under activating conditions.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>The results of the SPT15 depletion measurements are surprising. How is H3K4me2 present in the memory paradigm especially if it was absent during the activation phase? Perhaps one explanation (which I assume the authors favor) is that there is a transcription independent mechanism of H3K4me2 deposition. I am surprised by the fact that this pathway is as efficient as the transcription dependent one (comparing %IP levels). Either the authors are overestimating the effects, or it is a timing issue of when the authors choose to test re-activation? This conclusion as it relates to Figure 4C must be addressed with either additional experiments or a plausible explanation that accounts for the transcription independent pathway being as efficient as the transcription independent one.</p></disp-quote><p>We conclude from our data that transcription is essential for H3K4 methylation under activating conditions and that it is dispensable under memory conditions.

Loss of Sfl1 leads to a defect in transcription (D’Urso et al., 2016). The loss of RNAPII in these experiments upon Sfl1 degradation argues that Sfl1 is required for the establishment and continuous presence of RNAPII (Figure 7). The important finding of this experiment is that Sfl1 is required for both establishment and maintenance of peripheral localization, H2A.Z and RNAPII binding during memory, but that it is required for establishment, but not maintenance of H3K4me2 during memory. Furthermore, conditional inactivation of Sfl1 once memory is established demonstrated that RNAPII-independent H3K4me2 is mitotically heritable.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Figure 6C (and Figure 1) are very compelling pieces of data and strongly argue for a transcription or at least an RNA polII independent mode of H3K4me2 deposition.

The conceptual problem is that not all genes behave like INO1 as a result of which the coIP is unlikely to really reflect how complexes at one particular locus in the genome are changing. If the authors want to generalize their conclusions, there needs to be more genome wide data. Another possible way to address this (although it is a much weaker experiment) is to do the same coIP in different deletion backgrounds where cells exhibit the same phenotype as leo1 δ.</p></disp-quote><p>We agree that this experiment alone does not settle the mechanism.
