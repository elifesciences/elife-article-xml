Numerous studies suggested that 3′UTR-mediated p53 expression regulation plays a role in tumorigenesis and could be exploited for therapeutic purposes. However, these studies did not investigate post-transcriptional regulation of the native <italic>TP53</italic> gene. Here, we used CRISPR/Cas9 to delete the human and mouse <italic>TP53/Trp53</italic> 3′UTRs while preserving endogenous mRNA processing. This revealed that the endogenous 3′UTR is not involved in regulating p53 mRNA or protein expression neither in steady state nor after genotoxic stress. Using reporter assays, we confirmed the previously observed repressive effects of the isolated 3′UTR. However, addition of the <italic>TP53</italic> coding region to the reporter had a dominant negative impact on expression as its repressive effect was stronger and abrogated the contribution of the 3′UTR. Our data highlight the importance of genetic models in the validation of post-transcriptional gene regulatory effects.</p></abstract><kwd-group kwd-group-type="author-keywords"><kwd>Post-transcriptional gene regulation</kwd><kwd>CRISPR-mediated gene editing</kwd><kwd>3′UTR knock-out</kwd><kwd>reporter assay</kwd><kwd>mouse model</kwd><kwd>deletion of endogenous 3′UTRs</kwd></kwd-group><kwd-group kwd-group-type="research-organism"><title>Research organism</title><kwd>Human</kwd><kwd>Mouse</kwd></kwd-group><funding-group><award-group id="fund1"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000052</institution-id><institution>NIH Office of the Director</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>DP1-GM123454</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Mayr</surname><given-names>Christine</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund2"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100010304</institution-id><institution>Pershing Square Foundation</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Mayr</surname><given-names>Christine</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund3"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000054</institution-id><institution>National Cancer Institute</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>P30 CA008748</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Mayr</surname><given-names>Christine</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund4"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100001659</institution-id><institution>Deutsche Forschungsgemeinschaft</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Mitschka</surname><given-names>Sibylle</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><funding-statement>The funders had no role in study design, data collection and interpretation, or the decision to submit the work for publication.</funding-statement></funding-group><custom-meta-group><custom-meta specific-use="meta-only"><meta-name>Author impact statement</meta-name><meta-value>The endogenous 3′UTR does not regulate TP53 mRNA or protein level and the 3′UTR is repressive when used alone in reporters, but addition of the coding region has a dominant repressive effect.</meta-value></custom-meta></custom-meta-group></article-meta></front><body><sec id="s1" sec-type="intro"><title>Introduction</title><p>The transcription factor p53 coordinates the cellular stress response. p53 regulates expression of genes involved in cell cycle control, DNA repair, apoptosis, metabolism, and cell differentiation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Kastenhuber and Lowe, 2017</xref>), thus allowing cells to adequately respond to various stimuli. In contrast to most other stress sensors, p53 is not dependent on de novo transcription as the <italic>TP53</italic> gene is continuously transcribed even in unstressed cells. This mechanism reduces the time of delay between signal detection and downstream responses. To avoid activation of p53 in unstressed cells, p53 protein levels are controlled by rapid protein degradation induced by MDM2 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Haupt et al., 1997</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Kubbutat et al., 1997</xref>).</p><p>Reduced levels or insufficient p53 activity are major risk factors for the development of cancer and more than half of all human cancers exhibit diminished p53 expression or function (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Kastenhuber and Lowe, 2017</xref>). In contrast, hyperactive p53 has been linked to impaired wound healing, obesity, and accelerated aging (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib42">Rufini et al., 2013</xref>). These phenomena highlight the importance of p53 protein abundance and activity regulation in human health.</p><p>For many years, the 3′ untranslated region (3′UTR) of the <italic>TP53</italic> mRNA has been a widely studied element of p53 expression regulation. 3′UTRs are essential for facilitating pre-mRNA processing. In addition, they can also recruit microRNAs (miRNAs), RNA-binding proteins, and lncRNAs which can modulate mRNA stability and protein translation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib47">Tian and Manley, 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">Mayr, 2019</xref>).

In particular, miRNAs targeting the <italic>TP53</italic> mRNA were previously established as putative gatekeepers that prevent p53 hyperactivation and some of these miRNAs are also elevated in cancer, e.g. miR-504, miR-30d, and miR-125 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Hu et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Li et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Banzhaf-Strathmann and Edbauer, 2014</xref>).

While <italic>TP53</italic> mRNA expression does not change upon DNA damage, upregulation of p53 protein expression is achieved through increased translation rates and lower protein turnover (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Kumari et al., 2014</xref>). Previous studies had suggested a role of the 3′UTR in the upregulation of p53 translation after exposure to genotoxic stress (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Fu and Benchimol, 1997</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">Mazan-Mamczarz et al., 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Chen and Kastan, 2010</xref>). To assess stress-induced p53 expression regulation in dUTR cells, we treated cells with the topoisomerase inhibitor etoposide which is known to upregulate p53 protein expression by causing DNA double-strand breaks. We found that concentration-dependent upregulation of p53 protein expression was similar in parental, control clone, and dUTR cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2C and D</xref>). In addition, p53 levels analyzed over a period of 2 days revealed similar p53 expression kinetics (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2E and F</xref>). Finally, we tested additional stress stimuli including 5-fluorouracil (a thymidylate synthase inhibitor) or UV irradiation. These treatments robustly upregulated p53 protein across all cell lines, but with no significant differences in p53 expression between WT and dUTR cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2G and H</xref>).

As transcription of MDM2 itself is activated by p53, the expression of both proteins is balanced by a negative feedback loop that could obscure a change in p53 synthesis rate. In order to assess p53 synthesis in the absence of MDM2-mediated degradation, we treated HCT116 cells with increasing concentrations of the MDM2 inhibitor Nutlin-3. If p53 translation rates from dUTR transcripts were indeed altered, the inhibition of MDM2-mediated p53 degradation would lead to differences in p53 accumulation.

Until recently, research on 3′UTR functions has mostly been conducted using overexpression systems and reporter gene assays. In contrast, gene knockouts that disrupt the production of proteins from endogenous gene loci have long been considered the gold standard for analyzing gene functions. The advent of CRISPR/Cas9 gene editing tools has made the generation of 3′UTR knockouts using genomic deletion feasible in both cell lines and organisms.</p><p>Using these tools, we conclude that the endogenous <italic>TP53</italic> 3′UTR does not have a significant impact on p53 abundance regulation under standard conditions used to study p53, including induction of DNA damage in HCT116 cells and total body irradiation of mice (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figures 1D</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">2B, D, H</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">5B and D</xref>). These observations are in stark contrast to the data obtained by overexpression of synthetic constructs in previous studies (<xref ref-type="table" rid="table1">Table 1</xref>). While we could reproduce earlier reporter studies with respect to a repressive function of the <italic>TP53</italic> 3′UTR when used in isolation, we found that the 3′UTR-mediated repressive effect was eliminated in the context of an mRNA containing the <italic>TP53</italic> coding region (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4C</xref>).</p><p>Notably, the <italic>TP53</italic> coding region was the most repressive sequence tested in our reporter system. Our data further support the recently established role of the coding region as a major regulator of mRNA stability and translation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib40">Presnyak et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Eraslan et al., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">Mauger et al., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">Narula et al., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib49">Wu et al., 2019</xref>). Genome-wide comparisons of human coding regions showed that codon optimality and RNA structure in coding regions have the potential to modulate mRNA stability and translation efficiency to a similar extent as 3′UTRs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">Narula et al., 2019</xref>). These effects were often found to be translation-dependent, suggesting the involvement of ribosome-associated protein complexes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib49">Wu et al., 2019</xref>). The stronger contribution of the coding region is supported by the observation that the coding sequence of <italic>TP53</italic> is more conserved than the 3′UTR sequence. Although this is true for the majority of human genes, the conservation of the <italic>TP53</italic> 3′UTR is among the 20% poorest conserved 3′UTRs of protein coding genes. Given the fatal consequences of p53 deregulation, we speculate that a basic mechanism for p53 expression control may have first evolved in the coding region.</p><p>Moreover, we found that the <italic>TP53</italic> coding region abrogated the effect of additional suppressive elements in the 3′UTR. These results corroborated our findings from endogenous p53 regulation, where all sequence elements are located on the same transcript. The impact of sequence context on the effect of <italic>cis</italic>-regulatory elements has been previously described: The 5′UTR, codon optimality and splicing have all been shown to modulate the impact of 3′UTR elements in specific genes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Cottrell et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">Paolantoni et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib46">Theil et al., 2018</xref>). However, most studies investigate the effect of untranslated regions in isolation and hence the prevalence of this phenomenon is entirely unknown. Mechanistically, a different sequence context may lead to changes in RNA folding which could create constraints on RNA-binding motif accessibility. In addition, saturation effects and epistatic interactions might limit or modulate the impact of additional suppressive <italic>cis</italic>-regulatory elements provided by the sequence context (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Cottrell et al., 2018</xref>). Our data indicate that the different parts of mRNAs do not act autonomously, but are part of a regulatory unit and functionally cooperate with each other (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Cottrell et al., 2017</xref>; ; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib56">Zrimec et al., 2020</xref>).</p><p>3′UTR knockouts can be used to discriminate between direct and indirect targets of miRNAs and RNA-binding proteins. Both miRNAs and RNA-binding proteins usually regulate hundreds of mRNAs. This makes it difficult to assign phenotypes to the deregulation of specific target mRNAs. Moreover, miRNAs and RNA-binding proteins often target several genes in the same pathway (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Ben-Hamo and Efroni, 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib51">Zanzoni et al., 2019</xref>). Therefore, the results of overexpression or knockdown experiments with miRNAs and RNA-binding proteins may be confounded. This problem has likely contributed to the hypothesis that the 3′UTR is involved in p53 expression regulation. For example, the tumor suppressor RBM38 (also called RNPC1) was proposed to bind to the human <italic>TP53</italic> 3′UTR resulting in lower p53 expression in the presence of RBM38 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib52">Zhang et al., 2011</xref>). However, apart from <italic>TP53</italic>, RBM38 targets several other genes in the p53 pathway, including <italic>MDM2</italic>, <italic>PPMID</italic>, and <italic>CDKN1A</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib44">Shu et al., 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib50">Xu et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib54">Zhang et al., 2015</xref>). Expression changes of these genes can indirectly upregulate p53 or result in phenotypes that mimic p53 overexpression. Indeed, while RBM38 knockout mice show phenotypes consistent with p53 hyperactivation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib53">Zhang et al., 2014</xref>), <italic>Trp53</italic> dUTR mice are apparently normal. This suggests that the repressive effects of RBM38 on p53, that were previously attributed to be mediated by direct 3′UTR-dependent expression regulation, may be indirect. Similarly, HUR was shown to bind and regulate expression of both <italic>MDM2</italic> and <italic>CDKN1A</italic>. HUR-deficient mouse embryonic fibroblasts have cell cycle defects that can be rescued by MDM2 overexpression (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib48">Wang et al., 2000</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Ghosh et al., 2009</xref>).</p><p>In addition to the direct regulation of genes in the p53 pathway, we believe it is plausible that some prior studies observed p53 upregulation as a result of general cell stress. Overexpression and knockdown of RNA-binding proteins and miRNAs often result in expression changes across large sets of genes, which could lead to dysfunction in any number of pathways. As an integrator of the cellular stress response, p53 activation is uniquely sensitive to altered cell states. The anti-proliferative transcriptional program that is controlled by p53 is activated upon various stress signals not related to genotoxicity, including ribosomal stress, oxidative stress, loss of adhesion, and oncogene activation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Horn and Vousden, 2007</xref>). Hence, p53 protein stability may be indirectly regulated by these stress-response pathways as a function of p53 activation. These effects are highly reproducible and extremely difficult to control for.</p><p>We want to point out that a recent study that deleted endogenous 3′UTR sequences in several cytokine genes also found discrepancies between reporter-based assays and gene expression from native contexts (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib55">Zhao et al., 2017</xref>). In other cases, endogenous 3′UTR deletions led to the discovery of 3′UTR-dependent mRNA localization phenotypes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib45">Terenzio et al., 2018</xref>). Although our data indicate that p53 abundance regulation is 3′UTR-independent, the 3′UTR may still have important functions possibly through control of protein localization or protein activity as has been shown for other proteins (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Berkovits and Mayr, 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">Moretti et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib45">Terenzio et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Lee and Mayr, 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">Mayr, 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Bae et al., 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Fernandes and Buchan, 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Kwon et al., 2020</xref>). Finally, while our experimental conditions were highly similar to conditions tested in previous studies, we cannot fully exclude the possibility of 3′UTR-dependent expression regulation in select cell types or under specific conditions.</p><p>The unexpected finding that the endogenous <italic>TP53</italic> mRNA does not depend on the 3′UTR for post-transcriptional expression regulation as predicted by reporter assays makes a strong case for revising standard experimental procedures. 3′UTR knockouts allow to distinguish between direct and indirect effects associated with post-transcriptional regulation and they enable investigators to perform experiments under endogenous expression conditions. We think that this kind of genetic validation is critical for identifying the most promising gene targets for potential sequence-based miRNA therapeutics that aim to influence gene expression in human patients (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Kasinski and Slack, 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Hermeking, 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Bonneau et al.,

Additionally, reference samples with saturated 4sU-labeled RNA were generated by incubating HCT116 cells at a concentration of 100 µM 4sU for 3 days. After labeling, TRI Reagent (Invitrogen) was used to extract total RNA from cells. In the subsequent biotinylation reaction 40 µg of total RNA was mixed with 0.4 µg unlabeled yeast RNA, 10x biotinylation buffer (100 mM HEPES pH 7.5, 10 mM EDTA) and 10 µg MTSEA-biotin-XX (Biotium) in a total volume of 150 µl. The reaction was incubated for 30 min at room temperature and the RNA was recovered by ethanol precipitation. Then, half of the biotinylated RNA was mixed with 100 µM DTT and retained as the total RNA fraction. The other half was incubated with Dynabeads MyOne Streptavidin C1 magnetic beads (Invitrogen, blocked with 1% BSA and 1 µg/ml yeast tRNA) for 20 min at room temperature. Subsequently, the beads were washed three times with high-salt buffer (100 µM Tris-HCl pH 7.5, 1M NaCl and 0.1% NP40) using a magnet.

Your article has been reviewed by 3 peer reviewers, one of whom is a member of our Board of Reviewing Editors, and the evaluation has been overseen by Maureen Murphy as the Senior Editor.</p><p>Although the Reviewers all acknowledged the novelty of your system and the rigor of the findings presented, all three felt that certain key experiments were missing, particularly regarding RNA half-life and translation, in both stressed and unstressed cells. After conferring, the reviewers felt that the amount of new work requested was likely to be considerable, and potentially prohibitive.</p><p><italic>Reviewer #1:</italic></p><p>In this manuscript the authors investigated the role of the 3'UTR of p53 mRNA on endogenous p53 expression in human and mouse cells. The authors utilized CRISPR/Cas9 to delete the p53 3'UTR and found that deletion of the 3'UTR does not significantly affect the expression of the p53 protein and that of p21 mRNA, a well-established transcriptional target of p53. Although the data presented are interesting and contradicts several previous reports from different labs where the p53 3'UTR was shown to be regulated by miRNAs and RNA-binding proteins such as HuR, there are many concerns that should be addressed before further consideration. Indeed, even if the authors find that the 3UTR of p53 is not important for basal p53 expression and p53 induction in response to the DNA damaging agent, from a broader perspective, the significance of these findings is unclear to this reviewer.</p><p>Specific comments that need to be addressed are:</p><p>1. The authors should specifically describe how portions of the p53 3'UTR were determined to be essential or non-essential when determining the region to delete.</p><p>2. P53 is known to play an important role in G1 arrest in response to DNA damage. For example, in HCT116 cells, loss of p53 results in almost no G1 arrest upon Doxorubicin treatment. The authors should determine if there are differences in cell cycle distribution between the WT, dUTR and p53KO cells upon Doxorubicin treatment (300 nM, 48 to 72 hr of continuous treatment).</p><p>3. In Figure 3c, it is more beneficial to clone both the p53 coding sequence and the 3'UTR or dUTR fragment downstream of GFP, rather than having the coding sequence upstream and the 3'UTR downstream. Having the 3'UTR proximal to the coding sequence is more representative of biological conditions.</p><p>4. It appears that the WT 293T or HCT116 cells are parental cells. This may not be a rigorous control because these cells were not transfected and did not go through the process of clonal selection during CRISPR/Cas9. The ideal control for the dUTR cell lines would be to use clonal cell lines generated in parallel to the dUTR cells using a non-targeting gRNA or a wild-type clone. All Western blots and RT-qPCR experiments should be repeated using one of these proper negative controls.</p><p>5. p53 is regulated predominantly at the level of protein stability. Because miRNAs or RNA-binding proteins might be involved in fine-tuning p53 expression, the role of the 3'UTR might be underestimated if the immunoblots were not quantitated. The authors to provide quantifications of the immunoblot images, assuming they can use a detection system in the linear range.</p><p>6. It is important to determine if deletion of the 3'UTR results in compensatory mechanisms to restore p53 expression. To test this, the authors should compare the stability of endogenous p53 protein between the WT clones and dUTR clones in HCT116 and HEK293T cells. Additionally, by S35 methionine pulse chase experiments, the authors should compare the rate of translation of endogenous p53 in HCT116 and HEK293T WT vs dUTR clones. Is it possible that deletion of the 3'UTR results in decreased translation and increased p53 protein stability to restore p53 expression? The experiments to address this question should be repeated at least 3 times to get statistically relevant data.</p><p>7. The TP53 gene also expresses other p53 isoforms and an antisense transcript called Wrap53. Does deletion of the 3'UTR have any effect on the p53 isoforms and the antisense lncRNA? Addressing this could be important because loss of the p53 3UTR can affect the expression of these genes and profoundly alter the response of cells to DNA damaging agents.</p><p>8. The authors claim that others have shown regulation of p53 3UTR using reporter assays only. However, endogenous p53 mRNA translation was shown to be regulated by HuR. PMID: 14517280, 12821781.</p><p>9. In figure 1a, within the 3'UTR there is a particular segment in which binding sites for multiple RNA-binding proteins overlap. Is there any effect of deleting only this segment?</p><p><italic>Reviewer #2:</italic></p><p>In this interesting manuscript &quot;Endogenous p53 expression in human and mouse is not regulated by its 3′UTR&quot; Mitschka and Mayr examine the gene-regulatory potential of the evolutionarily conserved 3'untranslated region (UTR) of the human and mouse p53 gene (TP53). Using CRISPR-Cas9-mediated gene editing they carefully deleted the entire 3'UTR in human cell lines and mice, leaving processing elements intact. They show that deleting the potential regulatory elements in the TP53 3'UTR does not influence steady state p53 protein expression, as well as p53 protein activation after genotoxic stress.</p><p>The authors strongly imply that the TP53 3'UTR does not play an important role in TP53 gene function, nevertheless, the conservation of recognizable regulatory elements, such as miRNA binding sites is difficult to square with a lack of function. It would seem necessary to adress this seeming contradiction constructively, considering that it appears to undercut the importance of untranslated regions – if the conserved UTR of a key gene, such as TP53 does not convey some function, are UTRs even important?</p><p>The presented experiments are unobjectionable and performed to a high standard. That being said, the author's assays, particularly the experiments relating to p53 activation under genotoxic stress mainly cover two aspects: a) translational regulation of the TP53 mRNA and b) posttranslational activation of p53 protein. Considering that the vast majority of the literature points to p53 being activated by genotoxic stress by increasing p53 protein halflife, mainly due to prevention of p53 ubiquitination by MDM2, it is not particularly surprising that once steady-state levels of p53 protein are set, the 3'UTR itself should not play any important role. It is furthermore not surprising that expression of their reporter with the GFP-p53CDS fusion is efficiently suppressed, given that its levels will be controlled by MDM2 in a posttranslational manner. What would happen if steady-state levels of p53 are manipulated, e.g. by simultaneous depletion of MDM2?</p><p>With p53 being a key protein for cell survival, it is conceivable that its levels are tightly controlled, possibly by multiple buffer systems, not just the UTR alone. E.g. the authors never test whether the half-life of the mRNA itself is impacted – in Figure 1c, they show a trend towards downregulation of steady-state mRNA levels; this in turn could indicate that either transcriptional activity or mRNA half-life are affected. Putting numbers on these parameters might shed light on the presence of additional buffer systems in the cell/mouse ensuring proper p53 protein levels in a sort of fail-safe mechanism.</p><p>Finally, the authors do not explore the possibility that the effects of their knockouts can be buffered by compensatory mechanisms (e.g. described by the Stainier group that shows that for some genes acute loss by shRNA/siRNAs shows different and more severe phenotypes than gene editing). Of course, this is difficult to test; possibly rescue of full TP53 KO with constructs containing or lacking the TP53 UTR could shed some light on the mRNA dynamics.</p><p>In summary, by heavily relying on their genotoxic assays that are likely to depend on steady-state p53 protein levels, the authors may have been looking in the wrong place to observe an effect of the TP53 UTR on mRNA dynamics. While their main observation that TP53 UTR deletion by itself does not have a clear phenotype, and miRNA based therapies explored in the context of p53 are likely to fail, they miss the opportunity to address the question whether the TP53 UTR impacts mRNA dynamics and whether the presence of additional buffering mechanisms obscures a direct phenotype.</p><p>Three major points to be considered:</p><p>– mRNA halflife and transcription: Putting numbers on these parameters might shed light on the presence of additional buffer systems in the cell/mouse ensuring proper p53 protein levels in a sort of fail-safe mechanism.</p><p>– Acute vs chronic loss of p53 UTR: possibly rescue of full TP53 KO with constructs containing or lacking the TP53 UTR could shed some light on the mRNA dynamics.</p><p>– Considering that once p53 steady-state levels are set by the activity of MDM2, the effect of genotoxic stress may be predictable: What would happen if steady-state levels of p53 are manipulated, e.g. by simultaneous depletion of MDM2?</p><p><italic>Reviewer #3:</italic></p><p>By utilizing the CRISPR approach, authors specifically delete the majority of the 3'UTR from the endogenous p53 gene in multiple human cell lines as well in mouse. Their study revealed that deletion of the 3'UTR does not alter the mRNA as well as protein levels of p53 under normal as well as DNA damage. Based on these studies, the authors propose that unlike the findings of others in the literature, the 3'UTR does not seem to play crucial roles in regulating p53 mRNA levels or translation of the endogenous TP53 gene.</p><p>In general, this is a nicely articulated manuscript with interesting data. The data argue against the role of 3'UTR in the differential expression of p53. However the significance of the findings are not entirely clear to this reviewer, and it is felt that the authors may need to perform experiments to test the role of other elements (5'UTR as well as coding region) in regulating p53 stability as well as translation.</p><p>1. The steady state levels of a protein is dictated by regulated translation versus protein degradation, and each of these processes are controlled by distinct sequence elements located within the transcript. Does the 3'UTR of p53 influence differential translation? The authors really should check the polysome association of WT as well dUTR p53 mRNA.</p><p>2. Both the WT and the 3'UTR present in the dUTR constructs contain a small region, which based on earlier studies, can support the binding of a few RBPs and miRNAs. It cannot be completely ruled out that those interactions might influence the post transcriptional processing of the p53 mRNA. It might be worth doing an experiment in which the entire 3'UTR of the endogenous p53 could be replaced with the 3'UTR of a house-keeping gene to see the effect on p53 mRNA stability, polysome association and translation.</p><p>3. The reporter assays indicated that both the 3'UTR as well as the CDS region contribute to the steady state levels of p53 mRNA. It is not clear why the dUTR alone containing reporter showed increased steady state levels of reporter mRNA compared to WT, if the 3'UTR of p53 does not have any function in regulating the stability of p53 mRNA. This needs to be better-explained.</p></body></sub-article><sub-article article-type="reply" id="sa2"><front-stub><article-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.65700.sa2</article-id><title-group><article-title>Author response</article-title></title-group></front-stub><body><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Although the Reviewers all acknowledged the novelty of your system and the rigor of the findings presented, all three felt that certain key experiments were missing, particularly regarding RNA half-life and translation, in both stressed and unstressed cells.

The first of these functions is essential for gene expression, as a failure to cleave and polyadenylate a transcript will result in decreased or abrogated expression of the mRNA and protein. Our aim was to design the 3′UTR deletion so that the remaining sequence still allows the endogenous cleavage and polyadenylation machinery to efficiently process the nascent <italic>TP53</italic> transcript. To make an informed decision about the location of sequences involved in 3′ end processing, we re-analyzed ChIP-seq data for all relevant 3′ end processing factors on a genome-wide level (Martin et al., 2012). In agreement with prior analyses, we determined that the binding sites of core factors as well as auxiliary elements are usually confined to a region encompassing the last 100-150 nucleotides upstream of the cleavage site (see <xref ref-type="fig" rid="sa2fig1">Author response image 1</xref>). Therefore, we consider the 150 nucleotides located upstream of the cleavage site as essential.</p><p>Of note, the read coverage from CLIP-seq data for binding sites of individual cleavage factors were too sparse to map them precisely to the <italic>TP53</italic> mRNA. However, using global 3′ end processing factor binding patterns and established criteria for guide RNA selection, we designed a deletion that left only 147 nucleotides of the original 3′UTR upstream of the cleavage site. This rationale is described in the text (lines 82-93).</p><fig id="sa2fig1"><label>Author response image 1.</label><caption><title>mRNA cleavage and polyadenylation requires multiple sequence elements surrounding the cleavage site.</title><p>A, Schematic of the multiprotein complex responsible for mRNA cleavage and polyadenylation in humans.

In our opinion a thorough investigation of potential p53 functions is beyond the scope of this paper. However, as suggested by the reviewers, we have performed additional experiments that allowed us to measure mRNA and protein synthesis which further strengthen our claims on p53 abundance regulation (Figure 1E, 1F and new Figure 3A-E). Furthermore, we added a sentence to the ‘Discussion’ where we state the limitations of our work. Although we investigated 3′UTR-dependent p53 expression regulation using the most frequently used stress conditions, including DNA damage, UV, and γ-irradiation (line 322-324), we cannot entirely rule out that a condition exists where the p53 3′UTR regulates p53 abundance.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>3.

However, we found that N-terminally tagged p53 had an unusual subcellular localization (data not shown). Thus, in line with most p53 studies, we decided to use C-terminally tagged p53 constructs which would ensure the expression of a functional p53 protein as shown by others (Norris et al. 1997, Stewart-Ornstein et al. 2017).

We measured p53 protein translation using a non-radioactive metabolic labeling technique. We think that this approach is better suitable than S35 methionine treatment to measure p53 synthesis in a truly unstimulated state, as genotoxic stress caused by the radioactive labeling itself was shown to result in p53 activation (Yeargin and Haas, 1995). The new data show no difference in p53 synthesis rate in dUTR cells compared with cell containing the WT 3′UTR (new Figure 3C-E).</p><p>We used an additional approach to examine p53 production rate. As p53 degradation is dominated by MDM2 (Haupt et al., 1997;; Kubbutat et al., 1997), we examined p53 accumulation by adding increasing concentrations of the MDM2 inhibitor Nutlin-3. We did not detect a significant difference in p53 level in response to Nutlin-3 treatment between parental WT, control clone and dUTR cells (new Figure 3A, 3B), again suggesting that p53 synthesis rate is 3′UTR-independent.</p><p>Steady state protein levels are determined by production rate and degradation rate. As our data showed that p53 steady-state as well as production rate were 3′UTR-independent, we did not additionally measure p53 protein stability.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>7.

Both mechanisms are known to give rise to at least twelve different p53 protein variants (see new Figure 2-Figure supplement 1A). For most analyses in the manuscript, we used a p53 antibody clone (DO-7) that detects all p53 protein variants with a complete N-terminus. In addition, in the revised manuscript, we have added western blot analyses using the p53-specific antibody clone PAb240 that recognizes the p53 DNA binding domain that is present in all isoforms (see new Figure 2-Figure supplement 1A). We did not find evidence for differences in p53 alternative isoform expression as a result of the 3′UTR deletion (new Figure 2-Figure supplement 1B).</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>8.

Instead, we listed in Table 1 all experimental approaches that were used by other investigators. However, to avoid confusion, we clarified the text in lines 179 and 245 and say “…often use reporter genes…” or “…has mostly been conducted….”.</p><p>When we analyzed existing research on the topic, we evaluated whether an experiment provides direct evidence for binding and regulation by a specific factor, or indirect evidence that can further support that claim. Evidence for direct regulation in <italic>cis</italic> includes assays that abrogate the effect of a factor upon mutation or deletion of the binding site in the 3′UTR. This is usually achieved with reporter constructs, where such manipulations are easily feasible. Alternatively, direct 3′UTR-dependent regulation could be achieved through morpholinos that sterically block access to a specific endogenous binding site, while leaving overall activity of the RBP or miRNA intact as described by Staton and Giraldez (2011). However, none of the studies that investigated p53 regulation used morpholinos.</p><p>Most prior papers present indirect evidence in addition to reporter assays. For example, p53 protein levels are measured after overexpression or knockdown of a miRNA or RNA-binding protein. While these experiments likely yield reproducible phenotypes, they cannot distinguish between direct effects on the <italic>TP53</italic> 3′UTR and indirect effects that lead to p53 regulation through other pathways. For example, the RNA-binding proteins HUR and RBM38 have putative binding sites in both <italic>MDM2</italic> and <italic>TP53</italic>, as well as in hundreds of other genes. As a result, measuring p53 protein level as a read-out is not sufficient to unambiguously prove that the regulation occurs in <italic>cis</italic> with the 3′UTR of <italic>TP53</italic> as the main target.</p><p>The use of our 3′UTR knock-out strategy enables investigators to tease apart these complex gene regulatory networks. Our study demonstrates for a widely studied and important gene that 3′UTRs do not necessarily regulate mRNA or protein abundance as is often assumed. We have added a more extensive discussion to better explain the potential limitations of prior studies on this subject (lines 283-311).</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>9. In figure 1a, within the 3'UTR there is a particular segment in which binding sites for multiple RNA-binding proteins overlap. Is there any effect of deleting only this segment?</p></disp-quote><p>Given the time that it takes to generate and validate genetically modified cell clones, we were not able to create and analyze new mutant cell lines during the manuscript revision. Instead, we created a reporter construct with this deletion in the <italic>TP53</italic> 3′UTR, called TP53-3′UTR (U-del) that we overexpressed in <italic>TP53-/-</italic> HCT116 cells (new Figure 4C). We created reporter constructs both with and without the <italic>TP53</italic> coding region and measured mRNA and protein levels. We largely confirm the data produced by other groups using very similar constructs (Fu et al., 1999). Specifically, we find that the deletion of the U-rich element leads to de-repression of the reporter mRNA and protein relative to the non-mutated full-length 3′UTR. In fact, this construct yields similar mRNA and protein levels as the much shorter dUTR construct.</p><p>Importantly though, when we coupled this <italic>TP53</italic> 3′UTR (U-del) sequence to the <italic>TP53</italic> coding region, these differences disappeared. All constructs that contained the <italic>TP53</italic> coding region (regardless of 3′UTR) were expressed at much lower levels. The combination of the coding region with any of the tested 3′UTR sequences did not result in further repression of the reporter. Our results demonstrate that the <italic>TP53</italic> coding region has a dominant effect on <italic>TP53</italic> mRNA and protein expression. This is a novel insight and we added this result to the abstract to increase the significance of the manuscript.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Reviewer #2:</p><p>In this interesting manuscript &quot;Endogenous p53 expression in human and mouse is not regulated by its 3′UTR&quot; Mitschka and Mayr examine the gene-regulatory potential of the evolutionarily conserved 3'untranslated region (UTR) of the human and mouse p53 gene (TP53). Using CRISPR-Cas9-mediated gene editing they carefully deleted the entire 3'UTR in human cell lines and mice, leaving processing elements intact. They show that deleting the potential regulatory elements in the TP53 3'UTR does not influence steady state p53 protein expression, as well as p53 protein activation after genotoxic stress.</p><p>The authors strongly imply that the TP53 3'UTR does not play an important role in TP53 gene function, nevertheless, the conservation of recognizable regulatory elements, such as miRNA binding sites is difficult to square with a lack of function. It would seem necessary to adress this seeming contradiction constructively, considering that it appears to undercut the importance of untranslated regions – if the conserved UTR of a key gene, such as TP53 does not convey some function, are UTRs even important?</p><p>The presented experiments are unobjectionable and performed to a high standard. That being said, the author's assays, particularly the experiments relating to p53 activation under genotoxic stress mainly cover two aspects: a) translational regulation of the TP53 mRNA and b) posttranslational activation of p53 protein. Considering that the vast majority of the literature points to p53 being activated by genotoxic stress by increasing p53 protein halflife, mainly due to prevention of p53 ubiquitination by MDM2, it is not particularly surprising that once steady-state levels of p53 protein are set, the 3'UTR itself should not play any important role. It is furthermore not surprising that expression of their reporter with the GFP-p53CDS fusion is efficiently suppressed, given that its levels will be controlled by MDM2 in a posttranslational manner. What would happen if steady-state levels of p53 are manipulated, e.g. by simultaneous depletion of MDM2?</p><p>With p53 being a key protein for cell survival, it is conceivable that its levels are tightly controlled, possibly by multiple buffer systems, not just the UTR alone. E.g. the authors never test whether the half-life of the mRNA itself is impacted – in Figure 1c, they show a trend towards downregulation of steady-state mRNA levels; this in turn could indicate that either transcriptional activity or mRNA half-life are affected. Putting numbers on these parameters might shed light on the presence of additional buffer systems in the cell/mouse ensuring proper p53 protein levels in a sort of fail-safe mechanism.</p><p>Finally, the authors do not explore the possibility that the effects of their knockouts can be buffered by compensatory mechanisms (e.g. described by the Stainier group that shows that for some genes acute loss by shRNA/siRNAs shows different and more severe phenotypes than gene editing). Of course, this is difficult to test; possibly rescue of full TP53 KO with constructs containing or lacking the TP53 UTR could shed some light on the mRNA dynamics.</p><p>In summary, by heavily relying on their genotoxic assays that are likely to depend on steady-state p53 protein levels, the authors may have been looking in the wrong place to observe an effect of the TP53 UTR on mRNA dynamics. While their main observation that TP53 UTR deletion by itself does not have a clear phenotype, and miRNA based therapies explored in the context of p53 are likely to fail, they miss the opportunity to address the question whether the TP53 UTR impacts mRNA dynamics and whether the presence of additional buffering mechanisms obscures a direct phenotype.</p><p>Three major points to be considered:</p><p>– mRNA halflife and transcription: Putting numbers on these parameters might shed light on the presence of additional buffer systems in the cell/mouse ensuring proper p53 protein levels in a sort of fail-safe mechanism.</p></disp-quote><p>We thank the reviewer for spending time to review our manuscript and for the insightful comments.

However, we provide additional data on p53 protein synthesis using metabolic labeling. These experiments were performed in steady state conditions as well as during genotoxic stress. The data shown in the new Figures 3C-E show that p53 synthesis (in unstressed or stress conditions) does not depend on the 3′UTR.

Based on the suggestion of the reviewer, we examined the role of the <italic>TP53</italic> 3′UTR in the regulation of translation. Instead of using polysome association to measure translation, we used metabolic labeling with the non-radioactive methionine analog AHA to measure protein synthesis. The measurement of newly synthesized protein is a more direct read-out for mRNA translation than polysome association.

Both the WT and the 3'UTR present in the dUTR constructs contain a small region, which based on earlier studies, can support the binding of a few RBPs and miRNAs. It cannot be completely ruled out that those interactions might influence the post transcriptional processing of the p53 mRNA. It might be worth doing an experiment in which the entire 3'UTR of the endogenous p53 could be replaced with the 3'UTR of a house-keeping gene to see the effect on p53 mRNA stability, polysome association and translation.</p></disp-quote><p>The genomic 3′UTR deletion was designed to preserve endogenous 3′ end processing, which is essential to produce an mRNA through cleavage and polyadenylation.

In order to address the question if the remaining 3′UTR sequence is actively involved in p53 expression regulation, we expanded our set of test 3′UTRs to include three 3′UTRs of housekeeping genes (<italic>GAPDH</italic>, <italic>HPRT</italic>, <italic>PGK1</italic>) in the reporter assay where we measured reporter mRNA and protein expression (new Figure 4C). We also added a reporter construct using the BGH poly(A) terminator sequence that generates a 3′UTR with a length of 225 nucleotides. This construct serves as a baseline for reporter gene expression.

The reporter assays indicated that both the 3'UTR as well as the CDS region contribute to the steady state levels of p53 mRNA.
