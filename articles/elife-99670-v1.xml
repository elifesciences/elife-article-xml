Here, we found that cardiomyocyte-specific deletion of mouse AARS2 exhibited evident cardiomyopathy with impaired cardiac function, notable cardiac fibrosis, and cardiomyocyte apoptosis. Cardiomyocyte-specific AARS2 overexpression in mice improved cardiac function and reduced cardiac fibrosis after myocardial infarction (MI), without affecting cardiomyocyte proliferation and coronary angiogenesis. Mechanistically, AARS2 overexpression suppressed cardiomyocyte apoptosis and mitochondrial reactive oxide species production, and changed cellular metabolism from oxidative phosphorylation toward glycolysis in cardiomyocytes, thus leading to cardiomyocyte survival from ischemia and hypoxia stress. Ribo-Seq revealed that <italic>Aars2</italic> overexpression increased pyruvate kinase M2 (PKM2) protein translation and the ratio of PKM2 dimers to tetramers that promote glycolysis. Additionally, PKM2 activator TEPP-46 reversed cardiomyocyte apoptosis and cardiac fibrosis caused by AARS2 deficiency. Thus, this study demonstrates that AARS2 plays an essential role in protecting cardiomyocytes from ischemic pressure <italic>via</italic> fine-tuning PKM2-mediated energy metabolism, and presents a novel cardiac protective AARS2-PKM2 signaling during the pathogenesis of MI.</p></abstract><kwd-group kwd-group-type="author-keywords"><kwd>AARS2</kwd><kwd>PKM2</kwd><kwd>cardiomyocytes</kwd><kwd>glycolysis</kwd><kwd>cardiac remodeling</kwd></kwd-group><kwd-group kwd-group-type="research-organism"><title>Research organism</title><kwd>Mouse</kwd></kwd-group><funding-group><award-group id="fund1"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100012166</institution-id><institution>National Key Research and Development Program of China</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>SQ2023YFA1800026</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Xiong</surname><given-names>Jing-Wei</given-names></name><name><surname>Zhu</surname><given-names>Xiaojun</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund2"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100012166</institution-id><institution>National Key Research and Development Program of China</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>2018YFA0800501</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Xiong</surname><given-names>Jing-Wei</given-names></name><name><surname>Zhu</surname><given-names>Xiaojun</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund3"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100001809</institution-id><institution>National Natural Science Foundation of China</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>32230032</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Xiong</surname><given-names>Jing-Wei</given-names></name><name><surname>Zhu</surname><given-names>Xiaojun</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund4"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100001809</institution-id><institution>National Natural Science Foundation of China</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>31730061</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Xiong</surname><given-names>Jing-Wei</given-names></name><name><surname>Zhu</surname><given-names>Xiaojun</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund5"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100001809</institution-id><institution>National Natural Science Foundation of China</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>81870198</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Xiong</surname><given-names>Jing-Wei</given-names></name><name><surname>Zhu</surname><given-names>Xiaojun</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><funding-statement>The funders had no role in study design, data collection and interpretation, or the decision to submit the work for publication.</funding-statement></funding-group><custom-meta-group><custom-meta specific-use="meta-only"><meta-name>Author impact statement</meta-name><meta-value>AARS2 safeguards cardiomyocytes against ischemic injury by modulating PKM2-driven energy metabolism, revealing the AARS2-PKM2 axis as a previously unrecognized cardioprotective pathway in myocardial infarction.</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta specific-use="meta-only"><meta-name>publishing-route</meta-name><meta-value>prc</meta-value></custom-meta></custom-meta-group></article-meta></front><body><sec id="s1" sec-type="intro"><title>Introduction</title><p>Cardiovascular disease (CVD) remains the leading cause of death worldwide (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Mendis et al., 2015</xref>). Myocardial infarction (MI), a major type of CVDs, is considered an epidemic, affecting ~1â2 percent of adults and posing a serious threat to human health and life (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Thygesen et al., 2018</xref>). MI is due to coronary atherosclerosis and coronary heart disease, and MI patients can develop arrhythmia, shock, heart failure, and even death in a short time in severe cases (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Frangogiannis, 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Thygesen et al., 2018</xref>). MI results in massive loss of cardiomyocytes and abnormal cardiac remodeling with severe inflammation and fibrosis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib43">Zhang et al., 2022</xref>). However, it is incompletely understood how to prevent massive cardiomyocyte death and inhibit cardiac fibrosis in time to achieve cardiac repair. Therefore, the main goals of cardiovascular research are to improve the adverse consequences of MI by improving immune inflammation and cardiac remodeling, cardiomyocyte protection, cardiomyocyte regeneration, and avoiding the expansion of fibrosis and scars.</p><p>As the heart ages, the reduced integrity and increased risk of heart diseases such as myocardial ischemia frequently take place, ultimately leading to heart failure (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">Strait and Lakatta, 2012</xref>). Due to limited regenerative potential of mammalian cardiomyocytes, massive death of cardiomyocytes leads to a decrease in their numbers, causing myocardial remodeling, hypertrophy, and impaired cardiac function after MI (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">Whelan et al., 2010</xref>). Over the years, the most effective approach to reducing acute myocardial ischemic injury is to salvage surviving cardiomyocytes. During ischemia, oxygen supply is reduced, leading to a decrease in ATP generation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Kalogeris et al., 2012</xref>). The significant reduction in ATP levels during ischemia is associated with the development of irreversible changes in cardiomyocytes because the cells deplete their energy reserves and cannot maintain internal homeostasis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Saraste, 1999</xref>). To compensate for the reduced oxidative phosphorylation (OXPHOS) during ischemia, cardiomyocytes increase glycolysis to maintain homeostasis. Under extreme stress conditions, such as MI, cardiomyocytes experience toxic levels of Ca<sup>2+</sup> and reactive oxygen species (ROS). Mitochondrial electron transport chain (ETC) uncoupling leads to excessive ROS production, resulting in lipid and protein oxidation, widespread cell damage, and initiation of cardiomyocyte death (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Penna et al., 2009</xref>). The detrimental effects of ROS include DNA and RNA damage, lipid peroxidation, protein oxidation, and functional impairments (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Schieber and Chandel, 2014</xref>). Mitochondria play a vital role in various metabolic pathways (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Sissler et al., 2017</xref>). Mitochondria protein mutations, which are involved in mitochondrial metabolism and directly affect the central functions of mitochondria, have been extensively studied for a long time (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Gorman et al., 2016</xref>). On the other hand, mitochondrial dysfunction and mutations in different components of the mitochondrial translation machinery may indirectly impact ATP production (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Pearce et al., 2013</xref>). These include mitochondrial aminoacyl-tRNA synthetases (mt-AARSs).</p><p>Mt-AARSs are a group of nuclei-coding enzymes that ensure the accurate translation of the genetic code by binding 20 amino acids to their homologous tRNA molecules (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Meyer-Schuman and Antonellis, 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">OgnjenoviÄ and SimonoviÄ, 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Sissler et al., 2017</xref>). Cytoplasmic AARS provides amino acid-tRNA binding for protein translation, and the corresponding mt-AARS are introduced into the mitochondrial matrix, fulfilling their typical role of transporting amino acids for tRNA molecules encoded by their mitochondrial genomes (mt-tRNA). The accuracy of mitochondrial protein synthesis depends on the coordination of nuclear-encoded mt-AARS and mitochondrial DNA-encoded tRNA (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">OgnjenoviÄ and SimonoviÄ, 2018</xref>). Mitochondrial dysfunction is known to preferentially affect tissues with high energy requirements, especially the brain, muscles, and heart. It is widely recognized that nearly all nuclear genes associated with mt-AARS are considered pathogenic genes responsible for mitochondrial diseases (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Euro et al., 2015</xref>). Typically, mutations in the mitochondrial alanyl-tRNA synthetase (AARS2) gene cause infantile-onset cardiomyopathy and white matter brain disease from childhood to adulthood (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Nielsen et al., 2020</xref>). <italic>AARS2</italic> is the gene encoding mitochondrial alanyl-tRNA synthetase, which is responsible for connecting specific tRNA with its cognate amino acid, alanine (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib45">Zhang et al., 2023b</xref>). Recent studies have shown that AARS2 contains proline-hydroxylated conserved amino acid sequences, and its stability is enhanced under hypoxic conditions (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Mao et al., 2024</xref>). Mutations in AARS2 can cause mitochondrial dysfunction (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Dallabona et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">Vasilescu et al., 2018</xref>), leading to a reduction in cellular energy production (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Fine et al., 2019</xref>). However, the precise mechanisms by which AARS2 deficiency contributes to the development of cardiomyopathy in patients are not fully understood, and the potential of AARS2 as a therapeutic target for heart-related diseases remains to be explored.</p><p>One of the nodal points of energy metabolism is pyruvate kinase that catalyzes the conversion of phosphoenolpyruvate (PEP) to pyruvate, the last step of glycolysis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">MÃ©ndez-Lucas et al., 2017</xref>). Mammalian pyruvate kinases (PKs) are encoded by two genes (PKLR and PKM), and each can generate two isoforms, respectively (PKL and PKR; PKM1 and PKM2) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib40">Wong et al., 2015</xref>). Pyruvate kinase muscle isozyme 1 (PKM1) and pyruvate kinase muscle isozyme 2 (PKM2) are alternative splicing products of the PKM gene and express in various tissues (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Israelsen and Vander Heiden, 2015</xref>). PKM1 is found in some differentiated adult tissues, such as heart, muscle, and brain. PKM2 is widely expressed and a predominant isoform in many adult cell types, including kidney tubular cells, intestinal epithelial cells, and lung epithelial cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Dayton et al., 2016a</xref>). PKM1 has constitutively high catalytic activity, whereas PKM2 enzyme activity is subject to complex allosteric regulation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Ikeda et al., 1997</xref>), which allows cells to switch between glycolysis and biosynthesis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">Tang et al., 2023</xref>). PKM2 was recently found to protect cardiomyocytes from ischemia and promote cardiomyocyte proliferation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Magadum et al., 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Ni et al., 2022</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib41">Wu et al., 2021</xref>). However, it remains to be addressed how PKM2 protein and mRNA are regulated during pathogenesis of MI.</p><p>We have previously reported that AARS2 binds lactate to modulate metabolic proteins in ischemia hearts and skeletal muscles (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Du et al., 2022</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Mao et al., 2024</xref>). However, we have very limited knowledge on AARS2 function in the heart. And our previous experiments demonstrated that AARS2 overexpression had no significant effect on pyruvate dehydrogenase PDHA1 lactylation in cardiomyocytes. Here, we investigated AARS2 function under ischemic and hypoxic stress by employing both loss-of-function and gain-of-function of AARS2 in mice and neonatal rat cardiomyocytes (NRCMs). And we deciphered the mechanistic insights of AARS2 into energy metabolism by using a variety of cell biology, biochemistry, mass spectrometry, and transcriptomics technologies. This work not only reveals a novel cardiac protection signaling AARS2-PKM2, but also identifies therapeutic targets and small molecules for cardiomyopathy and MI.</p></sec><sec id="s2" sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><sec id="s2-1"><title>Deleting <italic>Aars2</italic> in adult cardiomyocytes causes heart failure</title><p>It is known that AARS2 deficiency causes human cardiomyopathy (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Nielsen et al., 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">Vasilescu et al., 2018</xref>), but the underlying mechanisms remain unclear. By comparing expression pattern of AARS2 before and after mouse MI, we found that both AARS2 proteins and mRNA decreased in the hearts after MI (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1A and B</xref>), suggesting that AARS2 might be involved in the pathological progression of MI.

The pathological processes of CVDs involve irreversible cardiomyocyte death, oxidative stress, inflammation, and cardiac fibrosis, which further contribute to adverse cardiac remodeling and ultimately lead to heart failure. Currently, there are no effective therapeutic strategies available for CVDs. This study showed that AARS2 plays a crucial role in salvaging cardiomyocytes from ischemic stress <italic>via</italic> fine-tuning PKM2-mediated energy metabolism, thus presenting novel therapeutic targets and potential small molecules for treating cardiomyopathy and MI.</p><p>Previous studies have shown that <italic>AARS2</italic> mutations lead to abnormal cardiomyocyte function, eventually to cardiomyopathy in human patients (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Nielsen et al., 2020</xref>). However, it remains unknown whether AARS2 functions in cardiomyocytes or non-cardiomyocytes and how AARS2 regulates cardiomyocyte function and metabolism. Mitochondrial OXPHOS is the primary pathway for adult cardiomyocytes to produce ATP, relying on oxygen in the mitochondria to oxidize substrates and generate ATP through the cellular respiratory chain. Under hypoxia, glycolysis serves as an alternative pathway for cells to produce energy, breaking down glucose into lactate and generating a small amount of ATP (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">Vander Heiden et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">Wei et al., 2023</xref>). By creating cardiomyocyte-specific cKO and transgenic overexpression of <italic>Aars2</italic> mice, we found that AARS2 is not only required for cardiomyocyte function, but also improving cardiomyocytes from ischemia and hypoxia, thus establishing the critical function of AARS2 in cardiomyocytes. This provides a principle for future AARS2 gene therapy with targeted delivery into cardiomyocytes not non-cardiomyocytes. Our mechanistic investigations revealed that mitochondrial OXPHOS and glycolysis were impaired in cardiomyocytes lacking AARS2, leading to energy supply disruption and metabolic imbalance, ultimately resulting in cardiomyocyte death. On the other hand, AARS2 overexpression had a striking protective effect on cardiomyocytes, partly <italic>via</italic> enhancing glycolysis and resistance of cardiomyocytes to ischemia and hypoxia. Unbiased Ribosome RNA-Seq and functional analyses point out PKM2 as an important mediator of AARS2 in regulating cardiomyocyte function and metabolism. PKM2 decreased in the hearts of <italic>Aars2</italic> cKO mice, with the reduced formation of PKM2 dimers and tetramers; and AARS2 overexpression led to an increase in glycolysis and attenuated OXPHOS, with increased PKM2 translation and the ratio of PKM2 dimers to tetramers. PKM2 is a key enzyme in the glycolytic pathway, involved in converting PEP into pyruvate and ATP (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">MÃ©ndez-Lucas et al., 2017</xref>). Under certain conditions, an elevation in PKM2 levels can enhance the activity of the glycolytic pathway, thereby increasing the cell's ability to produce ATP through glycolysis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib40">Wong et al., 2015</xref>). Recent studies have found that not only AARS1 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Ju et al., 2024</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib48">Zong et al., 2024</xref>), but also AARS2 is a lactate binding protein (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Mao et al., 2024</xref>). Increased AARS2 further leads to increased binding to lactate, and PKM2 dimer, as a key enzyme in lactate production, can promote the production of lactate through glycolysis. Thus, AARS2 overexpression promotes the glycolytic pathway by increasing PKM2 translation and formation of dimers, thereby supporting the survival and function of cardiomyocytes. This metabolic adaptation is crucial for the heart to maintain its physiological functions under hypoxic or ischemic stress. Indeed, the PKM2 activator TEPP-46 enables to rescue cardiomyopathy phenotypes including cardiomyocyte death and cardiac fibrosis. This is because TEPP-46 enhances the tetramerization of PKM2, which enhances OXPHOS for cardiomyocytes. Therefore, this work presents a new cardiomyocyte survival mechanism involving AARS2-PKM2 signaling under ischemic conditions.</p><p>It is widely recognized that cardiomyocytes undergo dramatic metabolic alterations and responses to oxidative stress during the pathogenesis of CVDs. Our Seahorse data suggested that the maximal OCR decreased, while the maximal ECAR strikingly increased, in <italic>Aars2</italic> Tg/+ transgenic hearts. These findings suggest an enhanced glycolytic pathway in AARS2-overexpressing cardiomyocytes, thereby augmenting their capacity for ATP production through glycolysis. This metabolic adaptation may contribute to sustaining the survival and functionality of cardiomyocytes, particularly under hypoxia or other stress conditions. This notion was also supported by functional analyses of AARS2 in NRCMs. Additionally, overexpression of AARS2 inhibits mtROS production and confers protection against ischemia and H/R-induced injury in cardiomyocytes. ROS represents a major oxidative species closely associated with cardiomyocyte damage and disease occurrence (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">Wei et al., 2023</xref>). Despite causing a reduction in OXPHOS, AARS2 overexpression also suppresses mtROS generation caused by ETC disorders, thus mitigating the detrimental effects of oxidative stress. Consequently, overexpression of AARS2 provides a protective mechanism by reducing mtROS levels and helps maintain normal physiological homeostasis within cardiomyocytes. In summary, upregulation or activation of PKM2 dimers mediated by AARS2 overexpression enhances glycolysis, thereby supporting the survival and functionality of cardiomyocytes, especially under hypoxic or stressful conditions. This metabolic adaptation coupled with reduction of ROS holds significant importance for maintaining normal cardiac function during challenging situations.</p><p>However, this study has certain limitations. The interaction between PKM2 and HIF-1Î± in the nucleus can affect the expression of glycolysis genes and promote cell survival (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Chen et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Palsson-McDermott et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Prakasam et al., 2018</xref>), thus it remains be addressed whether AARS2 acts through this mechanism in cardiomyocytes. Investigating specific interactions between PKM2 and AARS2 in the context of cardiac pathophysiology will provide a better understanding of cardiomyocyte metabolism and adaptation mechanisms, but glycolysis is only one of the processes that the body makes adaptive changes under special conditions. It remains unclear whether continuously excessive high levels of glycolysis is beneficial to cardiomyocytes. This study primarily relies on mouse models and NRCMs, lacking sufficient human data to validate the experimental outcomes in human cardiomyocytes. Therefore, more researches related to human subjects are necessary before translating these findings to clinical treatments in humans. Moreover, ribosome profiling sequencing (Ribo-Seq) data show that AARS2 enhances PKM2 translation only as part of the investigated mechanisms. In fact, AARS2 also affects the translation of many other proteins. Further investigations are needed to address the influence of AARS2 on gene translation. Additionally, delving into more mutual interactions and regulatory mechanisms between AARS2 and PKM2 will help uncover the regulatory mechanisms of AARS2 on cardiomyocyte energy metabolism, providing a deeper understanding and potential therapeutic targets for the treatment of CVDs. Therefore, future investigations are needed to address how AARS2 regulates mitochondrial function in cardiomyocytes, how AARS2 interacts with PKM2 complex to regulate mitochondrial metabolism, and how the AARS2-PKM2 signaling is related to the pathogenesis of human cardiomyopathy.</p></sec><sec id="s4" sec-type="materials|methods"><title>Materials and methods</title><table-wrap id="keyresource"

Cardiomyocyte-specific AARS2 overexpression in mice improved cardiac function and reduced cardiac fibrosis after myocardial infarction (MI), without affecting cardiomyocyte proliferation and coronary angiogenesis. Mechanistically, AARS2 overexpression suppressed cardiomyocyte apoptosis and mitochondrial reactive oxide species production, and changed cellular metabolism from oxidative phosphorylation toward glycolysis in cardiomyocytes, thus leading to cardiomyocyte survival from ischemia and hypoxia stress. Ribo-Seq revealed that AARS2 overexpression increased pyruvate kinase M2 (PKM2) protein translation and the ratio of PKM2 dimers to tetramers that promote glycolysis.

Since we are focusing on cardiomyocyte phenotypes, immunostaining on TUNEL and anti-cTnT directly evaluated the level of cardiomyocyte apoptosis, which was supported by Western blots with anti-Bcl-2 and anti-BAX of control and mutant hearts. TUNEL data accurately represents biochemical and morphological characteristics of apoptotic cells, and is more sensitive than the conventional histochemical and biochemical methods.

By investigating the effects of both deletion and overexpression of AARS2 in cardiomyocytes, the study aims to determine how AARS2 influences cardiac health and survival during ischemic stress.</p><p>The authors successfully achieved their aims by demonstrating the critical role of AARS2 in maintaining cardiomyocyte function under ischemic conditions. The evidence presented, including genetic manipulation results, functional assays, and mechanistic studies, robustly supports the conclusion that AARS2 facilitates cardiomyocyte survival through PKM2-mediated metabolic reprogramming. The study convincingly links AARS2 overexpression to improved cardiac outcomes post-MI, validating the proposed protective AARS2-PKM2 signaling pathway.</p><p>This work may have a significant impact on the field of cardiac biology and ischemia research. By identifying AARS2 as a key player in cardiomyocyte survival and metabolic regulation, the study opens new avenues for therapeutic interventions targeting this pathway. The methods used, particularly the cardiomyocyte-specific genetic models and ribosome profiling, are valuable tools that can be employed by other researchers to investigate similar questions in cardiac physiology and pathology.</p><p>Understanding the metabolic adaptations in cardiomyocytes during ischemia is crucial for developing effective treatments for MI. This study highlights the importance of metabolic flexibility and the role of specific enzymes like AARS2 in facilitating such adaptations. The identification of the AARS2-PKM2 axis adds a new layer to our understanding of cardiac metabolism, suggesting that enhancing glycolysis can be a viable strategy to protect the heart from ischemic damage.</p></disp-quote><p>We thank this reviewer for his/her supports on our manuscript.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Strengths:</p><p>(1) Comprehensive Genetic Models: The use of cardiomyocyte-specific AARS2 knockout and overexpression mouse models allowed for precise assessment of AARS2's role in cardiac cells.</p><p>(2) Functional Assays: Detailed phenotypic analyses, including measurements of cardiac function, fibrosis, and apoptosis, provided evidence for the physiological impact of AARS2 manipulation.</p><p>(3) Mechanistic Insights: This study used ribosome profiling (Ribo-Seq) to uncover changes in protein translation, specifically highlighting the role of PKM2 in metabolic reprogramming.</p><p>(4) Therapeutic Relevance: The use of the PKM2 activator TEPP-46 to reverse the effects of AARS2 deficiency presents a potential therapeutic avenue, underscoring the practical implications of the findings.</p><p>Weaknesses:</p><p>(1) Species Limitation: The study is limited to mouse and rat models, and while these are highly informative, further validation in human cells or tissues would strengthen the translational relevance.</p></disp-quote><p>We fully agree with this reviewer that this study is limited to mouse and rat models.

We have carefully revised this manuscript now.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>(7) Recent studies have shown that a decrease in oxygen levels leads to an increase in AARS2, and lactic acid rises rapidly without being oxidized. Both of these factors inhibit oxidative phosphorylation and muscle ATP production by increasing mitochondrial lactate acylation, thereby inhibiting exercise capacity and preventing the accumulation of reactive oxygen species ROS. The key role of protein lactate acylation modification in regulating oxidative phosphorylation of mitochondria, and the importance of metabolites such as lactate regulating cell function through feedback mechanisms, i.e. cells adapt to low oxygen through metabolic regulation to reduce ROS production and oxidative damage, and therefore whether AARS2 in the heart also acts in this way.</p></disp-quote><p>This is an interesting question. Since overexpression of AARS2 in muscles has previously been reported to increase PDHA1 lactylation and decrease its activity [4]. Actually, we initially examined whether overexpression of AARS2 in cardiomyocytes has similar effect on PDHA1 lactylation. However, our results showed that overexpression of AARS2 had no evident increases of lactylated PDHA1 in cardiomyocytes as shown below. However, future studies are needed to explore whether other proteins lactylation by AARS2 are involved in its cardiac protection function.</p><fig id="sa3fig6" position="float"><label>Author response image 6.</label><graphic mimetype="image" mime-subtype="tiff" xlink:href="elife-99670-sa3-fig6-v1.tif"/></fig><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p><bold>Reviewer #2 (Recommendations For The Authors):</bold></p><p>Suggestions for Improved or Additional Experiments, Data, or Analyses:</p><p>(1) Validation in Human Models: It would be great if, in the future, the authors could conduct experiments with human cardiomyocytes derived from induced pluripotent stem cells (iPSCs) to validate the findings in a human context. This would strengthen the translational relevance of the results.</p></disp-quote><p>We fully agree with this reviewer that this study is limited to mouse and rat models. It would certainly be important to address how AARS2-PKM2 is related myocardial infarction patients and/or human iPSC-derived cardiomyocytes in the future.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>(2) Broader Metabolic Analysis: To perform comprehensive metabolic profiling (e.g., metabolomics) to identify other metabolic pathways influenced by AARS2 overexpression or deficiency. This could provide a more holistic view of the metabolic changes and potential compensatory mechanisms.</p></disp-quote><p>As noted above, we indeed assessed other metabolites by mass spectrometry, we found that overexpression of AARS2 in either transgenic mouse hearts or neonatal cardiomyocytes had no consistent changes on the level of fumarate, succinate, malate, alpha-ketoglutarate (alpha-KG), citrate, oxaloacetic acid (OAA), ATP, and ADP, thus suggesting that AARS2 overexpression has more specific effect on the level of lactate, pyruvate, and acetyl-CoA.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>(3) Temporal Dynamics: Investigate the temporal expression and activity of AARS2 and PKM2 during the progression and recovery phases of myocardial infarction. Time-course studies could elucidate the dynamics and regulatory mechanisms involved.</p></disp-quote><p>As noted above, we found that both AARS2 proteins and mRNA decreased on the third and seventh day after myocardial infarction in mice. Others have reported PKM2 proteins increased after heart surgery in mice at different time points [1]. Thus, the level of AARS2 is reversely related to PKM2 after myocardial infarction.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>(4) Investigate Additional Pathways: Explore the involvement of other signaling pathways and tRNA synthetases that might interact with or complement the AARS2-PKM2 axis.

AARS2 deficiency caused mitochondrial dysfunction due to increasing ROS production and apoptosis while decreasing PKM2 function and glycolysis, thus leading to cardiomyopathy in mutant mice. On the other hand, overexpression of AARS2 in mice activates PKM2 and glycolysis while decreases ROS production and apoptosis, thus improving heart function after myocardial infarction.</p><fig id="sa3fig7" position="float"><label>Author response image 7.</label><graphic mimetype="image" mime-subtype="tiff" xlink:href="elife-99670-sa3-fig7-v1.tif"/></fig><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>(2) Discussion: Shorten the Discussion and systematically address the significance of the findings, limitations of the study, and potential future directions.
