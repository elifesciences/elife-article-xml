micro-environments. Inferring histopathological information from magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) findings, however, remains challenging due to absence of direct links between MRI signals and cellular structures. Here, we show that deep convolutional neural networks, developed using co-registered multi-contrast MRI and histological data of the mouse brain, can estimate histological staining intensity directly from MRI signals at each voxel. The results provide three-dimensional maps of axons and myelin with tissue contrasts that closely mimic target histology and enhanced sensitivity and specificity compared to conventional MRI markers. Furthermore, the relative contribution of each MRI contrast within the networks can be used to optimize multi-contrast MRI acquisition. We anticipate our method to be a starting point for translation of MRI results into easy-to-understand virtual histology for neurobiologists and provide resources for validating novel MRI techniques.</p></abstract><kwd-group kwd-group-type="author-keywords"><kwd>magnetic resonance imaging</kwd><kwd>deep learning</kwd><kwd>mouse brain</kwd><kwd>axon</kwd><kwd>myelin</kwd><kwd>histology</kwd></kwd-group><kwd-group kwd-group-type="research-organism"><title>Research organism</title><kwd>Mouse</kwd></kwd-group><funding-group><award-group id="fund1"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100009633</institution-id><institution>Eunice Kennedy Shriver National Institute of Child Health and Human Development</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>R01HD074593</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Zhang</surname><given-names>Jiangyang</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund2"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000065</institution-id><institution>National Institute of Neurological Disorders and Stroke</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>R01NS102904</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Zhang</surname><given-names>Jiangyang</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><funding-statement>The funders had no role in study design, data collection and interpretation, or the decision to submit the work for publication.</funding-statement></funding-group><custom-meta-group><custom-meta specific-use="meta-only"><meta-name>Author impact statement</meta-name><meta-value>Deep convolutional neural networks can generate virtual histology from magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) data to map cellular structures in the mouse brain with high specificity, which enables neurobiologists to use MRI to characterize neuropathology effectively.</meta-value></custom-meta></custom-meta-group></article-meta></front><body><sec id="s1" sec-type="intro"><title>Introduction</title><p>Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) is one of a few techniques that can image the brain non-invasively and without ionizing radiation, and this advantage is further augmented by a large collection of versatile tissue contrasts. While MRI provides unparalleled insight into brain structures and functions at the macroscopic level (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Lerch et al., 2017</xref>), inferring the spatial organization of microscopic structures (e.g., axons and myelin) and their integrity from MR signals remains a challenging inverse problem. Without a thorough understanding of the link between MR signals and specific cellular structures, uncertainty often arises when determining the exact pathological events and their severities. The lack of specificity hinders direct translation of MRI findings into histopathology and limits its diagnostic value.</p><p>Tremendous efforts have been devoted to developing new mechanisms to amplify the affinity of MRI signals to target cellular structures in order to improve sensitivity and specificity. Recent progress in multi-modal MRI promises enhanced specificity by integrating multiple MR contrasts that target distinct aspects of a cellular structure (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Mangeat et al., 2015</xref>). For example, magnetization transfer (MT), T<sub>2</sub>, and diffusion MRI are sensitive to the physical and chemical compositions of myelin, and combining them can lead to more specific myelin measurements than individual contrast (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Cercignani and Bouyagoub, 2018</xref>). Progress in this front, however, has been hindered by the lack of realistic tissue models for inference and ground truth histological data for validation.</p><p>The objective of this study is to test whether deep convolutional neural networks (CNNs), developed using co-registered histology and MRI data, can bypass the above-mentioned obstacles and enhance our ability to map key cellular structures from MR signals. With its capability to bridge data acquired with different modalities (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Christiansen et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Leynes et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Ounkomol et al., 2018</xref>), the deep learning framework (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">LeCun et al., 2015</xref>) has certain advantages over existing modeling approaches, as it is data-driven and not limited by particular models and associated assumptions. As MR signals are the ensemble average of all spins within each voxel, a typical set of three-dimensional (3D) MRI data, with millions of voxels, thus provides ample instances to train deep CNNs. Through training, the networks can potentially reconstruct the link between MR signals and cellular structures in co-registered histology and translate multi-contrast MRI data into maps that mimic histology. Our results demonstrate that this approach offers enhanced specificity for detecting axons and myelin compared to existing MRI-based markers. Furthermore, adding perturbations to the networks allows us to probe the relative contribution of individual MR contrast, which can be used to optimize multi-contrast MRI strategy and evaluate novel imaging contrasts.</p></sec><sec id="s2" sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><sec id="s2-1"><title>Prediction of auto-fluorescence images of the mouse brain from MR images using deep learning</title><p>We first demonstrated our method using co-registered 3D MRI and auto-fluorescence (AF) data. MRI dataset from ex vivo C57BL/6 mouse brain (P60, n = 6), each contained 67 3D MR (T<sub>2</sub>, MT, and diffusion) images, were spatially normalized to the Allen Reference Atlas (ARA) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Ng et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1A</xref>). We then selected 100 AF datasets from the Allen Mouse Brain Connectivity Atlas (AMBCA) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Oh et al., 2014</xref>) with minimal amounts of tracer signals in the forebrain. The contrast in the AF data is not specific to a particular structure, but a majority of hypo-intense regions co-localized with myelinated white matter tracts (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Christensen et al., 2014</xref>). These 3D AF data had already been normalized to the ARA and were down-sampled to the resolution of the MRI data (0.06 mm isotropic).

In order to determine the amount of training data sufficient to capture the relationship between these two modalities, we performed separate training sessions with target AF data ranging from randomly selected 60 subjects (i), 6 subjects (ii), single subject data (iii), down to 5000 and 1000 3 × 3 patches randomly selected within a single subject data (iv and v) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1C</xref>). The 3 × 3 patch size was shown to accommodate residual mismatches between MRI and AF data (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1F-H</xref>), and we chose such a small patch size instead of the entire image for training because we aimed to define the local relationship between cellular structures within an MRI voxel and corresponding ensemble-averaged MRI signals.</p><p>The performance of MRH-AF was evaluated using the average 3D AF data in the ARA (CCF version 3, average of 1675 mouse brains)(<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Oh et al., 2014</xref>) as the reference and MRI data from a separate group of mice (P60, n = 4) as the inputs. The MRH-AF results trained with 60-subject AF data as training targets (i) showed good agreement with the reference (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1D</xref>) and strong voxel-wise signal correlation (R<sup>2</sup> = 0.71, p &lt; 0.001, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s3">Figure 1—figure supplement 3C</xref>). The agreement was maintained for (ii) and (iii) both visually and quantitatively, as measured by the root mean square errors (RMSEs) and structural similarity index (SSIM) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1D–E</xref>). The specificity to hypo-intense regions in the reference defined by optimal thresholding was evaluated using receiver operating characteristic (ROC) analysis. The MRH-AFs trained with 60- and 6-subject AF data (i and ii) showed high specificity with areas under curve (AUCs) greater than 0.94, and the MRH-AF trained with 1-subject data (iii) had a slightly reduced average AUC of 0.937 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1F</xref>). The variation in the ROC curves in (iii), caused by the inter-subject variations in AF signals among subjects chosen for training, was relatively small. Further reducing the size of training data (iv and v) resulted in declined performances (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1D–F</xref>), emphasizing the need for sufficient training data.</p><p>The way that MRH-AF in (iii) translated individual 3 × 3 MR patches into AF signals was visualized in a 2D feature space derived by t-distributed stochastic neighbor embedding (t-SNE) analysis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">van der Maaten and Hinton, 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1G</xref>). Patches in the MRI data that were assigned with hypo-intense AF signals (orange) mostly clustered at the lower right corner, well separated from patches that were assigned with hyper-intense AF signals (turquoise) or near the brain surface (gray). Representative patches from the first two categories showed distinctive signal profiles (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1H</xref>). Switching the network inputs to modified 3 × 3 patches, in which all voxels were assigned the same MR signals as the center voxel, resulted in no apparent loss in sensitivity and specificity and still produced strong voxel-wise signal correlation with the reference AF maps (R<sup>2</sup> = 0.68, p &lt; 0.001, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s3">Figure 1—figure supplement 3</xref>), suggesting that MRH-AF primarily relied on multi-contrast MR signals, not patterns within patches, to generate its predictions. Overall, the result demonstrates that the ability of MRH-AF to translate multi-contrast MRI data into maps that mimic the tissue AF contrast in the AMBCA.</p><p>Reducing the number of residual blocks from 30 to 10 resulted in a slight reduction in quality of the predicted AF map (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2A–B</xref>) with significantly increased RMSEs but no significant change in SSIM (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2B</xref>). MRH-AF outperformed first- and second-order polynomial fittings (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2A–B</xref>, case i vs. case iv, case iii vs. cases v and vi), potentially due to the network’s ability to accommodate remaining mismatch between AF and MRI data. Replacing the 67 rawdata with five commonly used MR parameter maps (T<sub>2</sub>, MTR, FA, MD, and MK) as inputs to train the network produced less accurate AF predictions, for example, the loss of contrasts in the thalamus (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2A</xref>) as well as significantly increased RMSEs and decreased SSIMs (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2B</xref>). This suggests that the five MR parameters, although reflecting key tissue properties, do not contain all the information available from the 67 rawdata. However, using empirical or model-based MR parameters as inputs to the network has the advantage of broader applicability without requiring particular acquisition protocols and instruments, and a carefully selected and comprehensive set of such parameters will likely improve the predictions.</p><fig-group><fig id="fig2" position="float"><label>Figure 2.</label><caption><title>Understanding how multi-contrast magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) input influences the performance of MRH auto-fluorescence (MRH-AF).</title><p>(<bold>A</bold>) MRH-AF results generated under different conditions (top panel) compared to polynomial fitting results (lower panel).

Here, we built on these efforts by demonstrating that deep learning networks trained by co-registered histological and MRI data can improve our ability to detect target cellular structures.</p><p>Previous studies on the relationship between histology and MRI signals focused on correlating histological and MRI markers as co-registered MRI and histological data as well as realistic tissue models are scarce (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Jelescu and Budde, 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Novikov et al., 2018</xref>). Adopting similar approaches described by recent reports (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Christiansen et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Ounkomol et al., 2018</xref>) on using deep learning to generate histological labels from unlabeled light microscopy images, we demonstrate a proof of concept of using deep learning to solve the inverse problem of inferring histological information from MRI signals. Even though the resolution of the virtual histology is inevitably limited by the resolution of the input MRI data (~100 μm/voxel) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s4">Figure 3—figure supplement 4</xref>), the presented approach has many potential applications in biomedical research involving MRI. It can enhance our ability to accurately map selected cellular structures and their pathology in mouse models of diseases using non-invasive MRI, with contrasts familiar to neurobiologists. Although the networks cannot be applied to human MRI directly due to vast differences in tissue properties and scanning protocols, understanding how the networks improve specificity based on given MRI contrasts will guide the development of optimal imaging strategy in the clinics. In addition, the co-registered histology and MRI dataset provide a testbed for developing new MRI strategies. As it is relatively easy to normalize any new MRI data to our 3D multi-contrast MRI data and co-registered histology, the sensitivity and specificity of a new MRI contrast to target cellular structures can be evaluated. With quantitative information on the contributions of different MR contrasts, it is now straightforward to design accurate and efficient multi-contrast MRI strategy.</p><p>Perfect co-registration between MRI and histology is highly challenging, as conventional tissue preparations inevitably introduce tissue deformation and damages. In addition, differences in tissue contrasts between histology and MRI also limit the accuracy of registration. Serial two-photon tomography used by the Allen Institute and similar methods allow 3D uniform sampling of the entire brain, which facilitate registration using established registration pipelines (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Kuan et al., 2015</xref>). We expect recent advances in tissue clearing techniques can assist in this aspect once issues such as tissue shrinkage and penetration of antibodies for more target cellular structures are resolved. Remaining mismatches can be accommodated by choosing the appropriate patch size in the network as shown in our results and earlier studies (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Rivenson et al., 2019</xref>).</p><p>There are several directions to further improve our work. First, it is important to curate a training dataset that covers a broad spectrum of normal and pathological conditions and, ideally, with MRI and histology data acquired from the same animal. The data included in this study were adult mouse brain and most white matter structures are myelinated. As a result, the network to predict axons place a substantial weight on MRI contrasts that reflect myelin content (e.g., MT). With the inclusion of unmyelinated embryonic or neonatal mouse brains, we anticipate that the contribution of myelin will be reduced. Inclusion of pathological examples, such as <italic>shiverer</italic> mouse brain data, for training will likely improve our ability to characterize pathological conditions. The result from the <italic>shiverer</italic> data, while demonstrating the usage of the tool, does not tell us whether it will work for cases with more complex pathology, which will require further investigation. Second, the CNNs constructed in this study involved several common building blocks of deep learning, and new advances on network architecture design (e.g., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Goodfellow et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">Zhu et al., 2017</xref>) could further enhance the performance. While CNNs have been commonly treated as black boxes, several recently reported approaches, such as deep Taylor decomposition (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Montavon et al., 2017</xref>) and Grad-CAM (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Selvaraju et al., 2017</xref>), can help explain the inner working. Third, developing similar networks for in vivo MRI data and potential clinical application will require additional effort. The MRI data used in this study were collected from post-mortem mouse brain specimens, which are different from in vivo mouse brains due to death and chemical fixation. Differences in tissue properties between human and mouse brains also require additional steps. MRI parameters, either empirical or model based, may help to bridge this gap as they are translatable and less dependent on acquisition settings. As demonstrated in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2</xref>, networks trained using well-selected MRI parameters can predict tissue histology with reasonable accuracy. Finally, deep learning cannot replace the good understanding of the physics involved in MRI contrasts and the development of new MRI contrast that targets specific cellular structures.</p></sec><sec id="s4" sec-type="materials|methods"><title>Materials and methods</title><sec id="s4-1"><title>Animals and ex vivo MRI</title><p>All animal experiments have been approved by the Institute Animal Care and Use Committee at New York University, Memorial Sloan Kettering Cancer Center, and Johns Hopkins University.

Voxels that belong to these structures in the MRI and average 3D AF data in the ARA (down-sampled to 0.06 mm isotropic resolution) were assigned distinct intensity values, and a diffeomorphic mapping between the discretized atlas MRI and ARA AF data was computed using LDDMM. The mapping was then applied to the original atlas MRI data to generate an MRI template registered to the ARA space. Using dual-channel LDDMM (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Ceritoglu et al., 2009</xref>) based on tissue contrasts in the average DWI and FA images and the MRI template, the 3D MRI data acquired in this study were accurately normalized to the ARA space.</p><p>NF- and MBP-stained images of the C57BL/6 mouse brain were downloaded from the ARA reference dataset. Images with major artifacts or tissue loss were excluded. Small tissue tearing and staining artifacts were removed using the inpainting feature implemented in the photoshop heading brush tool (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://www.adobe.com">https://www.adobe.com</ext-link>), and dark voxels in the ventricles were replaced by the average intensity values of the cortex to match MRI data (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s1">Figure 3—figure supplement 1</xref>). The repaired images were down-sampled to an in-plane resolution of 0.06 mm/voxel. For each 2D histological image, the best-matching MRI section in the MRI template was identified, and a coarse-to-fine alignment from histology to MRI using affine transform and landmark-based image warping tool in ImageJ (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://imageJ.nete/BUnwarpJ">https://imageJ.nete/BUnwarpJ</ext-link>). The aligned 2D sections were then assembled into a 3D volume and mapped to the MRI template using LDDMM (between NF/MBP and FA) to further improve the quality of registration.</p></sec><sec id="s4-4"><title>Evaluation of image resolution</title><p>The resolution of MRI, histological images, were evaluated using a parameter-free decorrelation analysis method (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Descloux et al., 2019</xref>), without the initial edge apodization step.</p></sec><sec id="s4-5"><title>Design and training of the MRH networks</title><p>MRH networks are constructed using a CNN model with convolutions from the MRI to histology space. The networks were implemented using the deep learning toolbox in Matlab (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://www.mathworks.com">https://www.mathworks.com</ext-link>) using the directed acyclic graph architecture. To accommodate residual mismatches between MRI and histological data, the network consistently applied convolutional layers until the end layer that computed the distance loss to the target histology. The number of layers and neurons in each layer was determined empirically to balance performance and the risk of overfitting. We chose 64 hidden layers (60 layers in 30 residual blocks plus four layers at the input and output ends), each with 64 neurons, which applied a filter size of 3 × 3 and included a rectified linear unit (ReLu). Most of the hidden layers utilized skip connections to jump over layers to avoid vanishing gradients (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">He et al., 2016</xref>). The network was initialized with orthogonal random weights and was trained using a stochastic gradient descent optimizer to minimize voxel-level absolute distance loss (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s2">Figure 1—figure supplement 2A-B</xref>). Several choices of mini batch sizes were tested and the size was set to 128 to attain a balance between training speed and performance. Stochastic gradient descent with a momentum beta of 0.9 was used for stochastic optimization, with an initial learning rate of 0.1 and a learning rate factor of 0.1. During training, the learning rate was reduced by a factor of 0.1 every 10 epochs. Maximum epoch number was set at 60, but early stopping was employed if the validation set loss did not decrease in five epochs. During hyper-parameter tuning, 1000 3 × 3 patches were randomly held out to as the validation dataset and isolated from the training dataset. The weights from the epoch with the lowest validation loss were selected for final testing.</p><p>When retraining the MRH-AF neural network using MBP/NF data, we refined the last three layers’ parameters while leaving the parameters in other layers untouched in the Matlab deep learning toolbox using the directed acyclic graph architecture. The hyperparameters and training patches are the same as MRH-AF. Specifically, the network training initial learning rate was 0.0001, while learning rate factor was 0.1 to accomplish transfer learning. Using the stochastic gradient descent optimizer, our transfer learning converged as shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s2">Figure 1—figure supplement 2C-D</xref>.</p></sec><sec id="s4-6"><title>t-SNE analysis</title><p>The t-SNE cluster was performed using the Matlab t-SNE analysis function on the network prediction based on values in 2000 randomly selected 3 × 3 patches in the mouse brain MRI data.</p></sec><sec id="s4-7"><title>Contribution analysis</title><p>Following the perturbation method described by <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Olden et al., 2004</xref>, Rician noises were added to one input MR image to the pre-trained MRH networks, and RMSE between the noise contaminated outputs and the original output without noise was recorded.

Gaussian random displacement fields were generated for pixels on a 1 mm by 1 mm grid in the coronal plane and propagated to other voxels by B-spline interpolations. The displacement fields followed a Chi distribution with 2 degrees of freedom and were adjusted to match the level of voxel mismatches observed between MRI and histological data.</p></sec><sec id="s4-9"><title>Statistical analysis</title><p>Statistical significance was determined using unpaired Student’s t-test with threshold set at 0.05.

Specifically,</p><p>1) We have included results from a network trained using five summary measures as inputs (Figure 2A-B). The results suggest that using summary measures as inputs to the network can generate reasonable predictions of histology, which improve the prospect of generalizing the method to data generated from other MR systems.</p><p>2) We have compared the deep net with linear and quadratic fitting (Figure 2A-B), and the result demonstrates that deep learning network outperforms linear/quadratic fitting. One reason for this difference is that the deep network can accommodate residual mismatches between histology and MRI data (as demonstrated in Figure 1 —figure supplement 1). Such mismatches, often hard to completely remove, will affect polynomial fitting.</p><p>3) We also examined the need for deep net by varying the number of layers and compared the results. As shown in Figure 2A, lowering the number of residual blocks, each consists of two layers, from 30 to 10, still produce reasonable predictions for tissue auto-fluorescence (AF) signals. Further reducing the number of layers produces less satisfactory results. Furthermore, the number of layers needed also depends on the target histology. While a network with 10 residual blocks (~ 24 layers) can generate satisfactory predictions for tissue auto-fluorescence, 30 residual blocks (~64 layers) are needed to generate satisfactory predictions for Nissl staining as shown in Figure 5. We also clarified that convolution mostly work across channels in our network.</p><p>4) We have clarified the noise perturbation experiments. In the revised manuscript, we have removed the supplementary figure on t-SNE analysis of the noise perturbation, clarified that there are redundant information in the diffusion MRI dataset. We have focused on using the information to accelerate image acquisition as shown in Figure 2.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Reviewer #2 (Recommendations for the authors):</p><p>I would advocate two additional sets of experiments; in the simple form, align the existing histology maps (from, for example, the shiverer mice) to the MRIs from the same animals to provide direct quantifiable estimates of where the predicted histology slices deviate from the actual histology slices.</p></disp-quote><p>We have performed the experiment comparing predicted myelin histology from shiverer and control mice, whose data were not used to train MRH-MBP, with MBP stained histology from the same animals. The result in Figure 4 shows that the predicted MBP signals correlated strongly with the actual MBP signals (R<sup>2</sup>=0.91) and have higher sensitivity and specificity than magnetization transfer ratio (MTR), a commonly used MRI marker for myelin. However, in the Discussion section, we emphasized that more work needs to be done to investigate whether the tool works for more complex myelin pathology.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>More broadly, this paper would greatly benefit from an enhanced training set consisting of MRI and histology from the same animals co-aligned.

Currently, it is still a time consuming and challenging task to acquire high quality 3D histology from tissue specimens. Although tissue clearing promising techniques have made significant progress over the recent years, getting antibodies into deep structures in the adult mouse brain remains inconsistent. We have just started working with two groups to collect co-registered histology and MRI data, and it may take a year to fine-tune the protocols to obtain high quality 3D histology and co-registration process.</p></body></sub-article></article>
