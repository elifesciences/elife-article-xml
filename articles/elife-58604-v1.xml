immediate and delayed rewards are associated with numerous psychiatric disorders. Such ‘intertemporal’ choice is influenced by genetic and experiential factors; however, the contributions of biological sex are understudied and data to date are largely inconclusive. Rats were used to determine how sex and gonadal hormones influence choices between small, immediate and large, delayed rewards. Females showed markedly greater preference than males for small, immediate over large, delayed rewards (greater impulsive choice). This difference was neither due to differences in food motivation or reward magnitude perception, nor was it affected by estrous cycle. Ovariectomies did not affect choice in females, whereas orchiectomies increased impulsive choice in males. These data show that male rats exhibit less impulsive choice than females and that this difference is at least partly maintained by testicular hormones. These differences in impulsive choice could be linked to gender differences across multiple neuropsychiatric conditions.</p></abstract><kwd-group kwd-group-type="author-keywords"><kwd>sex differences</kwd><kwd>decision making</kwd><kwd>delay discounting</kwd><kwd>intertemporal choice</kwd><kwd>sex hormones</kwd><kwd>impulsivity</kwd></kwd-group><kwd-group kwd-group-type="research-organism"><title>Research organism</title><kwd>Rat</kwd></kwd-group><funding-group><award-group id="fund1"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000002</institution-id><institution>National Institutes of Health</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>R01AG029421</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Bizon</surname><given-names>Jennifer L</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund2"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000002</institution-id><institution>National Institutes of Health</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>RF1AG060778</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Setlow</surname><given-names>Barry</given-names></name><name><surname>Bizon</surname><given-names>Jennifer L</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund3"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000002</institution-id><institution>National Institutes of Health</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>K99DA041493</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Orsini</surname><given-names>Caitlin</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund4"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100007049</institution-id><institution>McKnight Brain Research Foundation</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Bizon</surname><given-names>Jennifer L</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund5"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100005270</institution-id><institution>McKnight Foundation</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Hernandez</surname><given-names>Caesar M</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund6"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution>Pat Tillman Foundation</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Hernandez</surname><given-names>Caesar M</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund7"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution>Thomas H.

One aspect of behavior that associates with many neuropsychiatric conditions is intertemporal decision making (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Heerey et al., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Bickel et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Bickel et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib75">Steinglass et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib87">Wilbertz et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Hoptman, 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib76">Steward et al., 2017</xref>), which involves choices between small rewards delivered immediately and larger rewards delivered in the future. Individuals choose large over small rewards in the absence of delays but will discount the value of the large rewards as a function of the delay before their delivery. Variation in intertemporal choice predicts a variety of life outcomes, with extreme biases in either direction associated with neuropsychiatric disease. For example, an inability to forgo immediate rewards in favor of larger rewards delivered in the future, or greater ‘impulsive choice’, associates with attention deficit hyperactivity disorder (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib87">Wilbertz et al., 2013</xref>) and substance use disorders (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Bickel et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Bickel et al., 2014</xref>). In contrast, a hallmark feature of the eating disorder anorexia nervosa is a maladaptive preference for delayed gratification (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib75">Steinglass et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib76">Steward et al., 2017</xref>). Notably, the prevalence of these conditions is sex-biased, with males exhibiting higher rates of ‘impulsive’ disorders (e.g., substance use, attention deficit hyperactivity disorder) and females exhibiting disproportionate rates of anorexia nervosa (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib62">Rolls et al., 1991</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Becker et al., 2017</xref>).</p><p>Despite such associations, there remains a surprising lack of consensus regarding how biological sex influences impulsive choice. Some studies in humans report that males show greater impulsive choice than females (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">Kirby and Maraković, 1996</xref>) whereas others report the opposite (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib42">Logue and Anderson, 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib60">Reynolds et al., 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib72">Smith and Hantula, 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Beck and Triplett, 2009</xref>) or a lack of gender differences altogether (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib47">Mischel and Underwood, 1974</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Kirby and Maraković, 1995</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib68">Silverman, 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Bembenutty, 2007</xref>). Studies in rodents have been equally inconclusive, with findings ranging from no sex differences (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib57">Perry et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Eubig et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib64">Sackett et al., 2019</xref>) to males being more impulsive than females (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib53">Panfil et al., 2020</xref>), to females being more impulsive than males (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib83">Van Haaren et al., 1988</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib56">Perry et al., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib85">Weafer and de Wit, 2014</xref>).</p><p>Even fewer studies have addressed the contributions of gonadal hormones to impulsive choice. Testosterone and estrogen are the primary hormonal drivers of developmental traits and characteristics in males and females, respectively (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib86">Wieland et al., 1971</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib88">Wilson et al., 1981</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib61">Rogol et al., 2002</xref>). Circulating levels of these hormones both during brain development and in fully mature adults can influence a variety of cognitive functions (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">Korol, 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib73">Spritzer et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Frick et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib84">Wagner et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">Koss and Frick, 2019</xref>). Studies show that circulating levels of these hormones associate with impulsive choice in both men and women (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib77">Takahashi et al., 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Doi et al., 2015</xref>). Similarly, impulsive choice can vary across the menstrual cycle in women (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib71">Smith et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Diekhof, 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib74">Stanton, 2017</xref>). Notably, however, while exogenous administration of supraphysiological levels of testosterone decreases impulsive choice in male rats (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib90">Wood et al., 2013</xref>), this effect is not observed in humans, at least at relatively low (replacement level) doses (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib52">Ortner et al., 2013</xref>). Moreover, it is unclear in either sex whether physiological levels of gonadal hormones are necessary for regulating impulsive choice.</p><p>Elucidating the role of sex and gonadal hormones in impulsive choice could offer important insights into both the etiology and treatment of neuropsychiatric diseases. The current study thus had two primary goals. The first was to thoroughly evaluate sex differences in naive adult male and female rats. The second was to determine whether gonadal hormones are necessary for sex-typical patterns of impulsive choice in each sex.</p></sec><sec id="s2" sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><p>A timeline of the sequence of experimental procedures is shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1A</xref>.

Male and female rats did not differ in the numbers of free-choice trials completed in the task (percentage of trials omitted, t<sub>(30) </sub>= −1.39, p=0.174). Moreover, in this experiment and all others reported below, all rats reduced their choice of the large reward as the delay to its delivery increased (main effects of delay, all ps &lt; 0.005). Importantly, males and females significantly differed in their choices between the large, delayed and small, immediate rewards. As shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2A</xref> (see <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="fig2sdata1">Figure 2—source data 1</xref> for raw data), females made fewer choices of large, delayed rewards than males (two-factor ANOVA, main effect of sex: F<sub>(1,30)</sub>=10.586, p=0.003), particularly when longer delays preceded delivery of the large reward (sex × delay interaction: F<sub>(4,120)</sub>=8.572; p&lt;0.001).

Specifically, rats’ latencies to press the two levers and to omit responding on the forced-choice trials that began each trial block were evaluated to provide a measure of motivation to obtain the small and large rewards associated with each lever (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib65">Setlow et al., 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib44">Mai et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Hernandez et al., 2017</xref>). A three-factor, repeated measures ANOVA (sex × delay × lever) was used to analyze the lever press latencies and indicated main effects of sex (F<sub>(1,27)</sub>=10.047, p=0.004), delay (F<sub>(4,108)</sub>=65.403, p&lt;0.001), and lever (F<sub>(1,27)</sub>=14.258, p=0.001). Moreover, as shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3A</xref> (see <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="fig3sdata1">Figure 3—source data 1</xref> for raw data), all interactions among these variables were significant (delay × sex: F<sub>(4,108)</sub>=9.206, p&lt;0.001; delay × lever: F<sub>(4,108)</sub>=36.690, p&lt;0.001; sex × lever: F<sub>(1,27)</sub>=17.510, p&lt;0.001; and sex × lever × delay: F<sub>(4,108)</sub>=7.823, p&lt;0.001). To further elucidate these interactions, two-factor, repeated-measures ANOVAs (lever × delay) were used to analyze lever press latencies in males and females separately. While analyses of both males and females revealed main effects of delay (males: F<sub>(4,60)</sub>=17.453, p&lt;0.001; females: F<sub>(4,40)</sub>=28.762, p&lt;0.001) and delay × lever interactions (males: F<sub>(4,60)</sub>=8.603, p&lt;0.001; females: F<sub>(4,48)</sub>=27.137, p&lt;0.001), a main effect of lever was only present in females (males: F<sub>(1,15)</sub>=0.089, p=0.769; females: F<sub>(1,12)</sub>=30.349, p&lt;0.001). Consistent with female preference for the small, immediate reward on free-choice trials, females showed much longer latencies to press the large compared to the small reward lever on forced-choice trials. In contrast, males showed comparable latencies for both levers. The percentage of omitted forced-choice trials was analyzed in a similar manner. As with the latency analysis, a three-factor repeated measures ANOVA (sex × lever × delay) conducted on the percentage of forced-choice trials omitted revealed main effects of sex (F<sub>(1,30)</sub>=16.363, p&lt;0.001), lever (F<sub>(1,30)</sub>=15.995, p&lt;0.001), and delay (F<sub>(4,120)</sub>=20.695, p&lt;0.001) as well as interactions across factors (sex × lever: F<sub>(1,30)</sub>=8.602, p=0.006; sex × delay: F<sub>(4,120)</sub>=8.411, p&lt;0.001, lever × delay: F<sub>(4,120)</sub>=5.540, p&lt;0.001; sex × lever × delay: F<sub>(4,120)</sub>=5.156, p=0.001; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3B</xref>, see <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="fig3sdata2">Figure 3—source data 2</xref> for raw data). Follow up analyses for males and females performed separately showed that females omitted more forced-choice trials on the large compared to small reward lever, particularly at the longest delays (main effect of lever: F<sub>(1,15)</sub>=13.988, p=0.002; lever × delay: F<sub>(4,60)</sub>=7.526, p&lt;0.001).

Response latencies may provide insight into the affective and/or motivational processing underlying a response; longer latencies may indicate negative affect or reduced motivation for an action, whereas shorter response latencies may indicate positive affect or heightened motivation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Crespi, 1942</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Amsel, 1950</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib65">Setlow et al., 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib44">Mai et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib49">Orsini et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib67">Shimp et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Hernandez et al., 2017</xref>). Consistent with this interpretation, both males and females in the current study had shorter latencies to respond for the large reward relative to the small reward under no delay conditions, and large reward response latencies in both sexes increased as delays to the large reward increased. Relative to males, however, females took significantly longer in responsding to the large reward in the presence of delays. Females also displayed an increase in the number of omitted large reward forced-choice trials in the presence of the longest delays, consistent with delay intolerance (i.e., at those delays, the large reward was so reduced in value as to not be worth pursuing at all). The current data indicate, however, that females were not less sensitive to reward than males. Indeed, females responded as rapidly as males in the absence of a delay. Hence, at least in the context of the food rewards and delays employed here, females and males are similarly sensitive to reward magnitude but females are substantially less tolerant of delays compared to males. Interestingly, these results parallel findings from across species that females are more sensitive to punishment than males (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib46">Miettunen et al., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib63">Rood et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Cross et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib50">Orsini et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Chowdhury et al., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Grissom and Reyes, 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib41">Liley et al., 2019</xref>). In this context, females may perceive the delays in the intertemporal choice task as a form of ‘cost’ that shares overlapping features with explicit punishment.</p><p>Delay intolerance in females as a primary driver of sex differences in intertemporal choice could account for some of the disparate findings in the rodent literature. Several prior studies failed to detect sex differences on intertemporal choice tasks (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib57">Perry et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib64">Sackett et al., 2019</xref>) whereas the results of other studies largely agree with the current findings (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib83">Van Haaren et al., 1988</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib56">Perry et al., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">Koot et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Eubig et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib43">Lukkes et al., 2016</xref>). In particular, the relatively long delays employed in the present study (0–60 s) may have been optimal for detecting sex differences driven by delay intolerance. Indeed, several studies using shorter delays (0–40 s or 0–20 s) failed to detect sex differences (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Eubig et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib64">Sackett et al., 2019</xref>).</p><p>In addition to the use of longer delays, other factors could have contributed to the robust sex difference observed in the present study, relative to previous findings of smaller or equivocal differences. Several prior studies found that females had numerically but not significantly greater impulsive choice compared to males (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Eubig et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib43">Lukkes et al., 2016</xref>). These studies, however, employed relatively small group sizes (n = 6–9/sex) compared to the current study (n = 16/sex), which could account in part for their failure to detect significant sex effects. Another difference between the current and prior studies concerns the age at which the animals were tested. In the current study, rats began testing at 6 months of age, whereas rats in prior studies in which sex differences were not detected began testing at 3–4 months of age (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib57">Perry et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib64">Sackett et al., 2019</xref>). Impulsive choice in both sexes is reported to decrease from adolescence (younger than 2 months) to young adulthood (greater than 2 months; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Doremus-Fitzwater et al., 2012</xref>) and in male rats it decreases further from 6 months to 24 months (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib70">Simon et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Hernandez et al., 2017</xref>). To our knowledge, changes in impulsive choice over the course of young adult maturation have not been investigated. Thus, it is possible that sex differences in impulsive choice become more pronounced over the course of young adulthood. It is not likely that the design of the intertemporal choice task alone (fixed delays proceeding in an ascending order) accounts for the presence of robust sex differences, as previous studies that both have and have not detected sex differences have employed this design as well as adjusting delay designs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib56">Perry et al., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib57">Perry et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib64">Sackett et al., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib53">Panfil et al., 2020</xref>). Finally, it should be noted that previous studies have not evaluated sex differences in intertemporal choice in Fischer 344 × Brown Norway F1 hybrid rats, and thus it is possible that sex differences are particularly pronounced in this strain. Sex differences in many aspects of cognition (including other forms of cost-benefit decision making) have been observed in several rat strains (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib81">van den Bos et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib54">Peak et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib50">Orsini et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Blaes et al., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib41">Liley et al., 2019</xref>), and several studies have shown differences in impulsive choice between rat strains (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Huskinson et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Garcia and Kirkpatrick, 2013</xref>). To our knowledge, however, no studies have directly compared sex differences in impulsive choice between strains, suggesting that this will be an important avenue of future research.</p></sec><sec id="s3-2"><title>Greater impulsive choice in females is not dependent on differential hunger/satiety</title><p>Prior studies have reported that the degree of food restriction can affect impulsive choice (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Bradshaw and Szabadi, 1992</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib89">Wogar et al., 1992</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Ho et al., 1997</xref>), such that greater restriction leads to lower levels of impulsive choice. Because the rats in the current study were food-restricted to 85% of their free-feeding body weights, one possible explanation for greater impulsive choice in females relative to males is that females experienced a subjectively different level of food restriction than males. Manipulation of restriction level through ad libitum feeding modestly decreased choices of large, delayed rewards, but this effect did not differ by sex. Additionally, although more females than males omitted entire blocks of free-choice trials under satiated conditions, there was a similar increase in the overall number of free-choice trial omissions in males and females, suggesting that both sexes experienced a comparable degree of satiation. As such, these findings argue against the interpretation that greater impulsive choice in females is due to a difference in hunger state.</p></sec><sec id="s3-3"><title>Testicular but not ovarian hormones are necessary for sex-specific patterns of impulsive choice</title><p>There is evidence that impulsive choice in women varies across the menstrual cycle, suggesting that preference for small, immediate vs. large, delayed rewards can be modulated by fluctuations in ovarian hormones within the physiological range (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">Kaighobadi and Stevens, 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib71">Smith et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Diekhof, 2015</xref>). To determine whether this variation is also evident in rats, impulsive choice was evaluated across phases of the estrous cycle. Although previous work shows that some aspects of cognition and behavior in rats can fluctuate across the estrous cycle (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib66">Shansky et al., 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib79">Tuscher et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Becker and Koob, 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Blume et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib55">Pellman et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib91">Yagi et al., 2017</xref>), there was no effect of estrous phase on impulsive choice in the current study. This finding is consistent with those from previous studies of sex differences in decision making involving risk of punishment or delayed punishment, in which estrous cycle does not modulate choice behavior (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib50">Orsini et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib41">Liley et al., 2019</xref>). Similarly, estrous phase does not influence rats’ accuracy in a delayed response working memory task, performance on which is correlated with impulsive choice (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib67">Shimp et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Blaes et al., 2019</xref>).</p><p>Removal of ovarian hormones through ovariectomy can alter some forms of learning and memory (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Bimonte-Nelson et al., 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib59">Qu et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Frick et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">Kim et al., 2016</xref>), and a study in rats performing an effort-based decision-making task found that ovariectomy increased rats’ choice of large, high-effort over small, low-effort rewards relative to their pre-surgery performance (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib80">Uban et al., 2012</xref>). To determine if sex differences in impulsive choice are influenced by gonadal hormones, males and females underwent either gonadectomy or sham surgeries. Consistent with the absence of estrous cycle effects on choice behavior, ovariectomies did not alter task performance, suggesting that if ovarian hormones contribute to the greater impulsive choice observed in females, their effects may be organizational rather than activational. Alternatively, local androgen synthesis in the brain (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib78">Tobiansky et al., 2018</xref>) might compensate for loss of circulating ovarian hormones to allow maintenance of pre-surgical patterns of choice behavior in females.</p><p>In contrast to the null effect of ovariectomies, orchiectomies increased impulsive choice relative to pre-surgery performance. Analyses of response latencies and trial omissions on forced-choice trials revealed patterns of performance in orchiectomized rats more akin to those in female rats than intact males (i.e., longer response latencies and more trial omissions at longer delays), suggesting that orchiectomy causes a shift toward reduced tolerance for delayed rewards. Importantly, these results are not explained simply by motivational deficits, as orchiectomies did not increase omissions on free-choice trials. These findings are consistent with the results of a prior study in which a supraphysiological dose of testosterone administered to intact male rats caused a decrease in impulsive choice (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib90">Wood et al., 2013</xref>). Hence, testicular hormone signaling may allow bidirectional modulation of impulsive choice in adult rats.</p><p>The fact that orchiectomy shifted impulsive choice implies that testicular hormones do not solely contribute to the male-typical pattern of impulsive choice in an organizational manner, but that they play an activational role as well. Impulsive choice is mediated by a network of corticolimbic-basal ganglia structures, including prefrontal cortex, basolateral amygdala, and nucleus accumbens, as well as dopaminergic and serotonergic innervation of these structures (see <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Floresco et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib58">Peters and Büchel, 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Bailey et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Fobbs and Mizumori, 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Frost and McNaughton, 2017</xref> for review). Androgen receptors are found within all of these brain regions, and their functions can be modulated by manipulations of testicular hormones (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib78">Tobiansky et al., 2018</xref>). Hence, it is likely that the effects of orchiectomy on impulsive choice are mediated at least in part via hormonal effects on these brain systems. Future studies involving manipulations of hormonal signaling within specific brain regions will be needed to address this issue.</p></sec><sec id="s3-4"><title>Limitations and conclusions</title><p>The results in the current study highlight two major findings. First, there was a significant and robust difference in impulsive choice between males and females that was not readily attributable to differences in food motivation or reward sensitivity. Second, we describe the novel finding that testicular hormones are necessary for maintaining the bias toward delayed gratification typical of males, whereas ovarian hormones do not appear to be necessary for maintaining the female-typical bias toward immediate gratification. Finally, the robust differences between males and females, as well as the differential roles of gonadal hormones, highlight the importance of assessing both sexes in studies of cost-benefit decision making (see <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib82">van den Bos et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib51">Orsini and Setlow, 2017</xref> for reviews).</p><p>The current study had some of the largest group sizes to date in an assessment of sex differences in impulsive choice; however, it is limited in that rats of only a single strain and age were evaluated on a single task design using a fixed set of delays. As such, although the use of rodents avoids factors that can bias studies of impulsive choice in human subjects (such as age, education, and socioeconomic status), it is not clear to what extent the current results are representative of human behavior. Indeed, a meta-analysis of studies assessing impulsive choice in human subjects found no sex difference, although the heterogeneity in subject ages and task designs renders it challenging to draw generalities (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Cross et al., 2011</xref>). Particularly given that (in both rodents and humans) females appear to be more sensitive than males to punishment (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Cross et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib51">Orsini and Setlow, 2017</xref>), it may be the case that greater impulsive choice among females will be most evident in circumstances involving actual (experienced, rather than hypothetical) rewards and delays.</p><p>Given the strong associations between extremes in impulsive choice and sex-prevalent psychiatric disorders (e.g., ADHD and substance use disorders associated with greater impulsive choice in males, and anorexia nervosa associated with reduced impulsive choice in females), it is interesting to speculate as to how such disorders might be related to sex differences in impulsive choice. Notably, the sex differences observed here (greater impulsive choice in females than males) are opposite of those predicted by the sex prevalence of psychiatric disorders associated with alterations in impulsive choice such as ADHD, SUDs, and anorexia nervosa. The results of the current study depict sex-atypical patterns of impulsive choice relative to sex differences in psychiatric disorders with which they are associated. In other words (and if the present findings in rats were extended to humans) male-prevalent psychiatric disorders are associated with male-atypical patterns of impulsive choice, whereas female-prevalent psychiatric disorders are associated with female-atypical patterns of impulsive choice. Although it is not clear whether and how such relationships are relevant to the etiology or symptoms of psychiatric disorders, future studies employing more targeted manipulations of gonadal hormone signaling may begin to address these questions.</p></sec></sec><sec id="s4" sec-type="materials|methods"><title>Materials and methods</title><sec id="s4-1"><title>Subjects</title><p>Adult male (n = 16) and female (n = 16) Fischer 344 × Brown Norway F1 hybrid (FBN) rats were obtained at 6 months of age from the National Institute on Aging colony (Charles River Laboratories) and individually housed in the Association for Assessment and Accreditation of Laboratory Animal Care International-accredited vivarium facility in the McKnight Brain Institute building at the University of Florida.

The trough was fitted with a photobeam to detect head entries and a 1.12 W lamp for illumination. Food rewards consisted of 45 mg soy-free food pellets (5TUL, 1811155; Test Diet, Richmond, IN, USA).

Rats were initially shaped to lever press to initiate delivery of a food pellet into the food trough and were then trained to nosepoke in the food trough to initiate lever extension. Each nosepoke triggered extension of either the left or right lever (randomized across pairs of trials), a press on which yielded a single food pellet.

Each 80 s trial began with a 10 s illumination of the food trough and house lights. A nosepoke into the food trough during this time extinguished the food trough light and triggered extension of either a single lever (forced-choice trials) or both levers simultaneously (free-choice trials). Each block began with two forced-choice trials (one for each lever) followed by 10 free-choice trials. The forced-choice trials were designed to remind rats of the delay contingencies in effect for that block. A press on one lever (either left or right, counterbalanced across age groups) resulted in one food pellet (the small reward) delivered immediately. A press on the other lever resulted in four food pellets (the large reward) delivered after a variable delay. The identities of the levers remained consistent throughout testing. Failure to press either lever within 10 s of its extension resulted in the levers being retracted and lights extinguished, and the trial was scored as an omission. Once either lever was pressed, both levers were retracted for the remainder of the trial. The duration of the delay preceding large reward delivery increased between each block of trials (0, 10, 20, 40, 60 s; or 0, 2, 4, 8, 16 for females after ovariectomies), but remained constant within each block.

On the following day, all rats were tested under the usual food-restricted conditions (as a ‘washout period’ for the 1 hr ad libitum feeding schedule). On the third day, the second half of the cohort was given the 1 hr ad libitum feeding schedule. After a 48 hr washout period, rats were given a 24 hr ad libitum feeding schedule using the same design as the 1 hr feeding schedule. Comparisons of choice performance under the two ad libitum feeding conditions were conducted using a three-factor, repeated measures ANOVA, with sex as a between-subjects factor and both feeding condition (ad libitum vs. food-restricted) and delay as within-subjects factors. The percentages of free-choice trial omissions were compared using a two-factor, repeated measures ANOVA with sex as a between-subjects factor and feeding condition (ad libitum vs. food restricted) as a within-subjects factor.</p></sec><sec id="s4-4-3"><title>Evaluation of gonadectomy in intertemporal choice</title><p>Procedures used to analyze data after surgery were identical to those used to analyze data prior to surgery. Data from a stable five session window were averaged to calculate a mean percent choice of the large reward at each delay (0, 10, 20, 40, 60 s). Group comparisons were conducted in males and females separately using a three-factor, repeated measures ANOVA, with surgery group (sham vs. gonadectomy) as a between-subjects factor and surgery phase (pre- vs. post-surgery) and delay as within-subjects factors. Comparisons of forced-choice lever response latency and forced-choice trial omission data were conducted within each surgical group using a three-factor, repeated measures ANOVA, with surgery phase (pre- vs. post-surgery), lever type (small vs. large), and delay as within-subjects factors. Finally, the percentages of free-choice trial omissions were compared using a two-factor, repeated measures ANOVA with surgery group (sham vs. gonadectomy) as a between-subjects factor and surgery phase (pre- vs. post-surgery) as a within-subjects factor.</p></sec></sec></sec></body><back><ack id="ack"><title>Acknowledgements</title><p>We thank Vicky S Kelly, Matthew M Bruner, Shannon C Wall, and Bonnie I McLaurin for technical assistance.

Your article has been reviewed by three peer reviewers, including Shelly B Flagel as the Reviewing Editor and Reviewer #1, and the evaluation has been overseen by Kate Wassum as the Senior Editor.</p><p>The reviewers have discussed the reviews with one another and the Reviewing Editor has drafted this decision to help you prepare a revised submission.</p><p>We would like to draw your attention to changes in our revision policy that we have made in response to COVID-19 (https://elifesciences.org/articles/57162). Specifically, we are asking editors to accept without delay manuscripts, like yours, that they judge can stand as <italic>eLife</italic> papers without additional data, even if they feel that they would make the manuscript stronger. Thus the revisions requested below only address clarity and presentation.</p><p>Summary:</p><p>The authors investigate the impact of sex and gonadal hormones on impulsive responding in rats. While this topic is not novel, the results in the literature are mixed, and the authors attempted to dissociate sex and hormonal factors using a strong within-subject design. They report sex differences, with females showing more impulsive responding relative to males and conclude that this difference is likely due to testicular hormones, as gonadectomy affected male, but not female, responding. These gonadectomy results were considered to be a valuable contribution to the understanding of the influence of sex on impulsivity.</p><p>The reviewers agreed that this manuscript is well-written, that the data are easy to assimilate and beautifully graphed, and that the concluding paragraph in particular gives much food for thought. However, they feel that the conclusions need to be tempered and that further analyses and discussion are warranted surrounding some of the points highlighted below.</p><p>Essential revisions:</p><p>1) One primary concern with this manuscript is that it is aiming to resolve a big question that others have tried to resolve before this group, namely whether there are sex differences in performance of delay discounting tasks. The current data clearly imply that there are, and that females are more impulsive, but previous groups were likely just as confident in their assessment. Why should this study be taken as being more definitive than any of the others that preceded it? What was done better or differently than others? Is this strain of rats more likely to represent the human condition, or is the behavioral methodology better for comparative psychology? The strengths and weakness of the current approach should be made explicit in the Discussion.</p><p>2) To be clear, the above questions do not invalidate the scientific study done here- in fact, review of the studies cited suggests that this is the largest study done to date (n = 16 per group vs. n = 4 (van Haaren)/6 (Eubig)/9-10 (Sackett)etc.) but it is still only a small number of animals. Although this is a typical sample size for an animal study, due to the greater experimental control inherent when using animal models, it is still possible to get results that are not indicative of the whole population, especially as commercial rodent suppliers generally tend to ship siblings rather than genetically diverse cohorts. Likewise, individual experiments using human subjects may find evidence for or against sex/gender differences due to a relatively small n. However, a meta-analysis found no gender differences in delay discounting tasks across 277 studies using human subjects (Cross et al., 2011).</p><p>3) Beyond the issue of sample size, there are also strain differences in delay discounting tasks (e.g. (Garcia and Kirkpatrick, 2012; Huskinson et al., 2012)) So, again, if this study is aiming to definitively demonstrate sex difference in delay discounting, large numbers of animals should be used and the effect should hold across multiple strains. I therefore urge the authors to temper their title and conclusions: although compelling, the current data are unlikely to resolve the issue of whether sex differences are present in the performance of delay-discounting tasks, but will simply be added in to the collection of studies, adding weight to one side of the argument, but certainly not ending it.</p><p>4) The repeated testing warrants further discussion. In relation, it seems that comparing males and females (with and without surgery) would be important in order to make claims about whether or not hormones are truly mediating the sex differences. Given the current analysis, it is difficult to say if gonadectomy rendered males more similar to females.</p><p>5) It is not clear that the described differences are not due to overall differences in motivation or reward magnitude. While the data suggest that males and females respond similarly to restricted feeding, it doesn't directly address the motivational state of females at the time of the original test. Further, the sex differences in latency and omitted trials highlights potential differences in motivational states. Additional analyses might be telling in this regard. For example, if only non-omitted trials are included, are there still sex differences in latency? Further, in their restricted feeding tests, more females than males are excluded due to omitted trials and this could be a meaningful sex difference. This warrants further discussion.</p><p>6) In relation to the point above, the food restriction data are useful, but suffer from a small effect size. It is hard to see how the females could become any more impulsive, and the lines seem to be on top of one another, yet there is no main effect of sex in the omnibus ANOVA. Given that these results are integral in proving that the effect in females is not dependent on differences in satiety for sugar pellets, it would be useful to analyse the data from females only and show there is a clear effect of food restriction in these rats.</p><p>7) Further, it seems that the longer response latencies and greater percentage of trial omissions seen in females on the forced choice trials for the larger reward could also indicate that this large reward isn't as rewarding for females as males? This is partially addressed by the 24-hr ad lib feeding study but not entirely as ad lib feeding seems to affect females differently than males (note the decrease in % choice at the 0 sec delay and the increase in omissions seen in females after 24hr ad lib feeding).</p><p>8) Post-hoc comparisons should be included in the primary text when appropriate. For example, it is stated, &quot;As shown in Figure 2A, females made fewer choices of large, delayed rewards than males (two-factor ANOVA, main effect of sex: F<sub>(1,30)</sub>=10.586, p=0.003), particularly when longer delays preceded delivery of the large reward (sex x delay interaction, F<sub>(4,120)</sub>=8.572; p&lt;0.001). However, the graph suggests that sex differences were more robust at shorter delays. Post-hoc comparisons should be included for each delay.</p><p>9) In the Introduction, the authors mention previous work showing that testosterone administration in rats can influence impulsive choice whereas work in humans does not recapitulate these effects. The authors should discuss how this incongruity in the literature may influence the translational interpretation of their findings.</p></body></sub-article><sub-article article-type="reply" id="sa2"><front-stub><article-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.58604.sa2</article-id><title-group><article-title>Author response</article-title></title-group></front-stub><body><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Essential revisions:</p><p>1) One primary concern with this manuscript is that it is aiming to resolve a big question that others have tried to resolve before this group, namely whether there are sex differences in performance of delay discounting tasks.

We agree that other groups were likely just as confident in their findings, but we believe that our data provide the most convincing evidence to date for greater impulsive choice in female compared to male rats. Prior rodent studies in agreement with our findings either had small sample sizes or were not designed to explicitly test sex differences. One study employing an intertemporal choice task in which delays for the large reward were varied across sessions in 4 male and 4 female Wistar rats found that females discounted large food rewards to a greater extent than males when the delay to delivery increased from 9 to 36 s (van Haaren et al., 1988). Similarly, another study using rats bred for variability in saccharin preference employed an adjusting delays task and found that female rats were more impulsive relative to males (Perry et al., 2007). This sex difference was conditional, however, in that it was only evident in rats with low preference for saccharin (but not high preference for saccharine).</p><p>Two more recent studies also reported evidence for numerically greater impulsive choice in female than male rats, although the differences did not reach statistical significance (Eubig et al., 2014; Lukkes et al., 2016). In the first study, Eubig et al. employed an intertemporal choice task design similar to that used in our study and found that female rats had numerically fewer choices of large, delayed rewards relative to males. In the second study, Lukkes et al. also employed an intertemporal choice task design similar to that used in our study to evaluate impulsive choice in adolescent and adult male and female rats. These authors reported a numerically lower indifference point (greater impulsive choice) in female relative to male rats. It is possible that neither of these studies were sufficiently powered to detect statistically significant sex differences, given their smaller group sizes (Eubig et al.: n=6/sex; Lukkes et al.: n=8-9/sex) compared to our study (n=16/sex).</p><p>One study using mice in an intertemporal choice task in which mice had to nosepoke into food troughs that delivered a small immediate food reward vs. a large, delayed food reward reported that females were more impulsive than males (Koot et al., 2009). Like the Perry et al., 2007 study described above, however, these results were conditional in that the sex difference was only present in “high-discounting” mice, whereas there were no sex differences in “low-discounting” mice.</p><p>In contrast to the (limited) evidence for greater impulsive choice in female relative to male rodents described above, two studies reported neither numerical nor statistically significant sex differences in impulsive choice (Perry et al., 2008; Sackett et al., 2019). Although Perry and colleagues previously reported greater impulsive choice in females relative to males (Perry et al., 2007), these authors reported no such difference in a subsequent study (Perry et al., 2008). The null effect in the 2008 study could have been due to strain differences, as their previously reported sex differences (Perry et al., 2007) were in a subset of Sprague-Dawley rats bred for saccharin preference, whereas the lack of differences in the 2008 paper was in Wistar rats. The Sackett et al., 2019 study tested Long-Evans rats in an intertemporal choice task similar to that used in our study and found no differences between males and females in their choice behavior. Despite a null effect of sex in this study, however, when the authors used rats’ individual variability in choice behavior to sort them into high discounters (i.e., more impulsive choice) and low discounters (i.e., less impulsive choice), the high discounter group contained double the number of females relative to males, whereas the low discounting group contained double the males relative to females.</p><p>The results of the current study explicitly and unequivocally show a greater preference for small, immediate rewards in females relative to males and are in agreement (at least numerically if not statistically) with the bulk of the rodent literature on the topic, across rodent species and strains. Although the strain used in our study could certainly account for the large sex difference (relative to most previous work), we suspect that the larger sample sizes and the use of longer delays to the large reward delivery relative to most previous studies played a greater role in our ability to detect sex differences. Note that we cannot claim that the Fischer 344 × Brown Norway F1 hybrid rats used in our study is more representative of humans than other strains.</p><p>We now provide a more expanded discussion of these issues in the Discussion section.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>2) To be clear, the above questions do not invalidate the scientific study done here- in fact, review of the studies cited suggests that this is the largest study done to date (n = 16 per group vs. n = 4 (van Haaren)/6 (Eubig)/9-10 (Sackett)etc.) but it is still only a small number of animals.

However, a meta-analysis found no gender differences in delay discounting tasks across 277 studies using human subjects (Cross et al., 2011).</p></disp-quote><p>The reviewer emphasizes an important point. Ideally, we would reproduce these results across multiple strains using identical methodology to support our claim; however, it is important to note that among rodent studies (including several using different rat strains), the preponderance of evidence seems to point to greater impulsive choice in females (see response to Point 1 above). Notably, we observed considerable individual variability among male rats this variability was less evident in females, likely due to a floor effect; (see Figure 4B and E). It will be important in future work to follow up on these individual differences, as there is considerable evidence (largely from male rats) that variability in impulsive choice predicts numerous other behavioral phenotypes relevant to neuropsychiatric disorders. One additional important point to make is that the rats in this study were run in 3 separate cohorts each separated by 12-24 months. As such, our detection of sex differences cannot be solely attributed to the use of rats from only a few different litters (i.e., reduced genetic variability). This latter point is now noted in the subsection “Subjects”.</p><p>Regarding the null findings of the meta-analysis done by Cross et al., 2011, we agree it could call into question the broader translational relevance of our findings, but we also believe that gender differences in impulsive choice may be conditional and nuanced. There are several studies in the human literature to suggest sex differences consistent with our findings (e.g., Logue and Anderson, 2001, Reynolds et al., 2006, Smith and Hantula, 2008, Beck and Triplett, 2009); however, factors such as the use of real vs. hypothetical rewards may influence the magnitude and direction of gender differences in impulsive choice (Kirby and Maraković, 1995; Kirby and Maraković, 1996; Weafer and de Wit, 2014). Considered together, it is possible that inconsistencies in gender/sex differences in impulsive choice can be attributed to the types of rewards used or the weights placed on distinct features of rewards. Particularly if delays are viewed as more “costly” or “punishing” by females (who tend to be more sensitive to punishments than males; Cross et al., 2011), it may be the case that greater impulsive choice among females will be most evident in circumstances that more closely model actual (experienced, rather than hypothetical) delays. We now mention this point in the subsection “Limitations and Conclusions”.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>3) Beyond the issue of sample size, there are also strain differences in delay discounting tasks (e.g. (Garcia and Kirkpatrick, 2012; Huskinson et al., 2012)) So, again, if this study is aiming to definitively demonstrate sex difference in delay discounting, large numbers of animals should be used and the effect should hold across multiple strains. I therefore urge the authors to temper their title and conclusions: although compelling, the current data are unlikely to resolve the issue of whether sex differences are present in the performance of delay-discounting tasks, but will simply be added in to the collection of studies, adding weight to one side of the argument, but certainly not ending it.</p></disp-quote><p>We thank the reviewer for this comment, and again we agree. We have now changed the title to clarify that the study was conducted in rats and have incorporated a more detailed discussion of the rodent literature within the manuscript (Discussion). We believe that our data are in agreement with the majority of prior evidence for greater impulsive choice in female rodents (see responses above). Indeed, across strains, to our knowledge, there are more studies showing greater impulsive choice in female rodents than not, although we concede the limitations of the use of a single rodent strain and task design in our study (subsection “Limitations and Conclusions”).</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>4) The repeated testing warrants further discussion. In relation, it seems that comparing males and females (with and without surgery) would be important in order to make claims about whether or not hormones are truly mediating the sex differences. Given the current analysis, it is difficult to say if gonadectomy rendered males more similar to females.</p></disp-quote><p>Repeated testing of the same animals before and after surgery allowed us to incorporate both within- and between-subjects comparisons of the effects of gonadectomy (GDX). In our view, this was the strongest possible experimental design as it allowed us to include both surgical condition and timepoint as variables (which in turn enabled us to determine the contributions of GDX vs. simply the passage of time from pre- to post-surgery). The reviewer makes a good point regarding claims about whether or not hormones mediate the sex difference. Although we would argue that the results in castrated males are certainly suggestive, additional experiments would be necessary to strongly draw this conclusion, and thus we have moderated our language on this point in the revised manuscript (Discussion).</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>5) It is not clear that the described differences are not due to overall differences in motivation or reward magnitude. While the data suggest that males and females respond similarly to restricted feeding, it doesn't directly address the motivational state of females at the time of the original test. Further, the sex differences in latency and omitted trials highlights potential differences in motivational states. Additional analyses might be telling in this regard. For example, if only non-omitted trials are included, are there still sex differences in latency? Further, in their restricted feeding tests, more females than males are excluded due to omitted trials and this could be a meaningful sex difference. This warrants further discussion.</p></disp-quote><p>The reviewer brings up an important point regarding the potential contributions of sex differences in motivation, and we have attempted to clarify this issue throughout the Results section. In particular, we did not distinguish well in our original manuscript between omissions on free- vs. forced-choice trials, which we have attempted to do throughout the revised manuscript.</p><p>We now clarify (subsection “Effect of sex on intertemporal choice performance”) that there was no sex difference in the number of omitted free-choice trials during the original comparison of performance under food restricted conditions (i.e., for the data shown in Figure 2). As shown by the data in Figure 4C and F, pre-feeding (which should reduce motivation to obtain food during subsequent task performance) causes an increase in free-choice trial omissions, suggesting that the number of free-choice trial omissions is a reasonable proxy for food motivation (see Simon et al. 2009, Neuropsychopharmacology for similar findings). Note that there were also no sex differences in omitted free-choice trials during these pre-feeding tests as well (subsection “Effect of food motivational state on intertemporal choice performance in males and females”). Given these data (as well as the absence of sex differences in choice behavior in the effects of varying degrees of pre-feeding), we believe that the data argue for no sex differences in primary motivation to obtain food, at least under the conditions required for intertemporal choice task performance.</p><p>Regarding the sex differences in response latencies and trial omissions on forced-choice trials (Figure 3), we agree with the reviewer that these data highlight sex differences in motivation; however, we argue that these data are more consistent with sex differences in motivation specifically to obtain the large, delayed reward rather than differences in food motivation in general. In females, the increases in latency and omitted trials were largely limited to choices of the large reward. Indeed, latencies to obtain the small reward did not change at all across blocks of trials in females (Figure 3A), and on neither measure did small reward latencies or small reward trial omissions differ by sex. If females were less food motivated than males (either in general or as a function of satiation as they progressed through the blocks of trials), we would expect this to be reflected in longer latencies and more trial omissions to an equivalent degree on both small and large reward trials. As the changes in latency and trial omissions in females were mostly selective to the large reward, we conclude that this was due to greater impulsive choice/delay intolerance in females. This argument is now presented in greater detail in the subsection “Effect of sex on intertemporal choice performance”.</p><p>Regarding the latency measures, we now clarify that only completed trials were included in the analyses of latency data (i.e., omitted trials were excluded from this analysis – this is now clarified in the subsection “Evaluation of sex differences in intertemporal choice”). The reviewer makes a good point regarding the greater number of excluded females than males in the pre-feeding test, however, and we now mention this point in the subsection “Greater impulsive choice in females is not dependent on differential hunger/satiety”.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>6) In relation to the point above, the food restriction data are useful, but suffer from a small effect size. It is hard to see how the females could become any more impulsive, and the lines seem to be on top of one another, yet there is no main effect of sex in the omnibus ANOVA. Given that these results are integral in proving that the effect in females is not dependent on differences in satiety for sugar pellets, it would be useful to analyse the data from females only and show there is a clear effect of food restriction in these rats.</p></disp-quote><p>We thank the reviewer for catching our errors in statistical reporting! In the revised manuscript we now clarify the results from the pre-feeding experiment. The 1-hr ad libitum feeding schedule caused n=2 male and n=5 female rats to omit enough choices to be excluded from the analysis of choice performance (leaving n=14 male and n=11 female) but not the analysis of free-choice trial omissions (for which all rats were included). For choice behavior, a multi-factor ANOVA (sex × feeding schedule × delay) confirmed the expected main effects of sex (F<sub>(1,23)</sub>=26.753, p&lt;0.001), delay (F<sub>(4,92)</sub>=112.833, p&lt;0.001) and the sex × delay interaction (F<sub>(4,92)</sub>=11.227, p&lt;0.001; Figure 4A). The 1-hr ad libitum feeding schedule decreased choice of large, delayed rewards (main effect of schedule: F<sub>(1,23)</sub>=5.861, p=0.024; Figure 4B) in a non-delay-dependent manner (schedule × delay: F<sub>(4,92)</sub>=1.368, p=0.251). Most importantly, however (and most relevant to the point being tested in this experiment), there were no interactions between sex and the 1-hr ad libitum feeding schedule (schedule × sex: F<sub>(1,23)</sub>=0.417, p=0.525; schedule × sex × delay: F<sub>(4,92)</sub>=1.270, p=0.288), suggesting that different levels of hunger/satiation in males and females did not account for the sex difference in choice performance. Note that there was a main effect of feeding schedule (F<sub>(1,30)</sub>=9.115, p=0.005; Figure 4C) on the percentage of free-choice trials omitted such that 1-hr ad libitum significantly increased trial omissions irrespective of sex (main effect of sex: F<sub>(1,30)</sub>=0.294, p=0.592; schedule × sex: F<sub>(1,30)</sub>=0.294, p=0.592) – see also the response to Point 5 above.</p><p>The 24-hr ad libitum feeding schedule caused n=3 female rats to omit enough choices to be excluded from the choice but not the trial omission analysis. A multi-factor ANOVA (sex × feeding schedule × delay) confirmed the expected main effects of sex (F<sub>(1,27)</sub>=13.414, p=0.001) and delay (F<sub>(4,108)</sub>=81.398, p&lt;0.001) and the sex × delay interaction (F<sub>(4,108)</sub>=7.899, p&lt;0.001; Figure 4D). Unlike the 1-hr ad libitum schedule, there was no decrease in the choice of large, delayed rewards as a result of the 24-hr ad libitum feeding schedule (main effect of feeding schedule F<sub>(1,27)</sub>=2.302, p=0.141; Figure 4E). Most importantly (and as with the 1-hr schedule), however, there was no interaction between sex and schedule (schedule × sex: F<sub>(1,27)</sub>=0.021, p=0.887; schedule × sex × delay: F<sub>(4,108)</sub>=1.433, p=0.228), indicating that a sex difference in food motivation likely does not account for the sex difference in choice performance. Importantly, as with the 1-hr ad libitum schedule, there was a significant of effect of feeding schedule on trial omissions such that more trials were omitted during the 24-hr ad libitum period (main effect of schedule: F<sub>(1,30)</sub>=13.400, p=0.001; Figure 4F) irrespective of sex (main effect of sex: F<sub>(1,30)</sub>=2.297, p=0.140; schedule × sex: F<sub>(1,30)</sub>=2.839, p=0.102). We now include the corrected statistics for this experiment in the text (subsection “Effect of sex on intertemporal choice performance”).</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>7) Further, it seems that the longer response latencies and greater percentage of trial omissions seen in females on the forced choice trials for the larger reward could also indicate that this large reward isn't as rewarding for females as males? This is partially addressed by the 24-hr ad lib feeding study but not entirely as ad lib feeding seems to affect females differently than males (note the decrease in % choice at the 0 sec delay and the increase in omissions seen in females after 24hr ad lib feeding).</p></disp-quote><p>The reviewers bring up an excellent point. We have now highlighted the absence of difference between males and females in free-choice trial omissions under baseline conditions (subsection “Effect of sex on intertemporal choice performance”), suggesting a comparable willingness to engage in the task (see also the response to point 5 above). We also now discuss the rats’ performance at the 0 s delay (Figures 2 and 3). Specifically, the fact that males and females show equivalent preference for the large reward in the absence of delays (Figure 2A) suggests robust detection of reward magnitude differences and preference for the larger reward in females. At the 0 s delay, females did show slightly (though not significantly) longer latencies than males to choose the large reward (Figure 3A, t<sub>(27)</sub> = -2.031, p=0.052; mean difference -0.222 s), but this sex difference was an order of magnitude smaller than the sex difference at longer delays such as 40 s (t<sub>(27)</sub> = -5.453, p&lt;0.001; mean difference -3.33 s) or 60 sec (t<sub>(27)</sub> = -3.103, p=0.004; mean difference -2.26 s). In addition, there was no sex difference in the number of forced choice large reward trial omissions at 0 sec delays (Figure 3B, t<sub>(30)</sub>=1.192, p=0.243). Considered together, these data provide little to no evidence that females were less motivated by the large reward <italic>per se</italic>, but rather are consistent with the idea that any reductions in motivation for the large reward were due to the delays imposed before its delivery in later blocks of trials.</p><p>In addition, we compared males and females at the 0 sec delay in both restricted and ad libitum conditions and did not observe any significant differences under restricted (t<sub>(23)</sub> = 1.888, p=0.072) or ad libitum (t<sub>(23)</sub> = 1.401, p=0.175) conditions (Figure 4A). Furthermore, paired samples t-tests comparing restricted and ad libitum conditions at 0 sec within sexes revealed no significant difference in males (t<sub>(13)</sub> = 1.0, p=0.336) or females (t<sub>(10)</sub> = 1.019, p=0.332). Closer inspection of the data highlighted that n=1 female rat decreasing choice of the large reward at 0 sec from 90% to 60% was responsible for driving the numerical difference.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>8) Post-hoc comparisons should be included in the primary text when appropriate. For example, it is stated, &quot;As shown in Figure 2A, females made fewer choices of large, delayed rewards than males (two-factor ANOVA, main effect of sex: F<sub>(1,30)</sub>=10.586, p=0.003), particularly when longer delays preceded delivery of the large reward (sex x delay interaction, F<sub>(4,120)</sub>=8.572; p&lt;0.001). However, the graph suggests that sex differences were more robust at shorter delays. Post-hoc comparisons should be included for each delay.</p></disp-quote><p>We thank the reviewer for their comment.

The authors should discuss how this incongruity in the literature may influence the translational interpretation of their findings.</p></disp-quote><p>We thank the reviewer for their comment. The previous work in rats involved very high levels of testosterone administration (the intention in this study was to model anabolic steroid abuse). In humans, whereas exogenous testosterone (at doses an order of magnitude lower than those used in abuse settings) does not seem to modulate impulsive choice (Ortner et al., 2013), salivary testosterone levels do associate with discounting of delayed gains (Takahashi et al., 2006), suggesting that testosterone levels within the physiological range may play a role in impulsive choice. We have now clarified this point in the Introduction.</p></body></sub-article></article>
