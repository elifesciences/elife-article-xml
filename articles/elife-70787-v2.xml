Dbf4-dependent kinase (DDK)/Hsk1<sup>Cdc7</sup> is a conserved replication initiator kinase with conflicting roles in replication stress response. Here, we show that fission yeast DDK/Hsk1 phosphorylates sirtuin, Hst4 upon replication stress at C-terminal serine residues. Phosphorylation of Hst4 by DDK marks it for degradation via the ubiquitin ligase SCF<sup>pof3</sup>. Phosphorylation-defective <italic>hst4</italic> mutant (<italic>4SA-hst4</italic>) displays defective recovery from replication stress, faulty fork restart, slow S-phase progression and decreased viability. The highly conserved fork protection complex (FPC) stabilizes stalled replication forks. We found that the recruitment of FPC components, Swi1 and Mcl1 to the chromatin is compromised in the <italic>4SA-hst4</italic> mutant, although whole cell levels increased. These defects are dependent upon H3K56ac and independent of intra S-phase checkpoint activation. Finally, we show conservation of H3K56ac-dependent regulation of Timeless, Tipin, and And-1 in human cells. We propose that degradation of Hst4 via DDK increases H3K56ac, changing the chromatin state in the vicinity of stalled forks facilitating recruitment and function of FPC. Overall, this study identified a crucial role of DDK and FPC in the regulation of replication stress response with implications in cancer therapeutics.</p></abstract><kwd-group kwd-group-type="author-keywords"><kwd>sirtuin</kwd><kwd>H3K56ac</kwd><kwd>replication fork</kwd><kwd>Swi1</kwd><kwd>timeless</kwd><kwd>genome stability</kwd></kwd-group><kwd-group kwd-group-type="research-organism"><title>Research organism</title><kwd><italic>S. pombe</italic></kwd></kwd-group><funding-group><award-group id="fund1"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100001843</institution-id><institution>Science and Engineering Research Board</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>Grant EMR/2016/003933</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Haldar</surname><given-names>Devyani</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund2"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100001501</institution-id><institution>University Grants Commission</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>Ref No. 23/06/2013i(EU-V)</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Aricthota</surname><given-names>Shalini</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><funding-statement>The funders had no role in study design, data collection and interpretation, or the decision to submit the work for publication.</funding-statement></funding-group><custom-meta-group><custom-meta specific-use="meta-only"><meta-name>Author impact statement</meta-name><meta-value>Sirtuin, Hst4 is a novel DDK kinase target, which is modified and degraded in response to replication stress, increasing H3K56 acetylation, to stabilize DNA replication forks via fork protection complex which maintains genome stability and has potential in cancer therapeutics.</meta-value></custom-meta></custom-meta-group></article-meta></front><body><sec id="s1" sec-type="intro"><title>Introduction</title><p>DNA replication forks stall at various impediments including damaged DNA templates, DNA-protein complexes and secondary structures in chromatin generating replication stress (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Iyer and Rhind, 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib104">Zeman and Cimprich, 2014</xref>). In response to replication stress, the intra-S phase checkpoint is activated to maintain forks in a replication competent state and prevent fork collapse. The major checkpoint sensor ATR/Rad3 is active even in unperturbed S-phase to help recover from endogenous replication fork impediments. The progression of replication fork is dependent upon the chromatin state. However, in response to replication fork stalling, cross-talks of chromatin with replisome is elusive. DDK (Dbf4-dependent kinase) is a highly conserved serine/threonine kinase involved in the regulation of DNA replication through phosphorylation of MCM (mini chromosome maintenance) helicase (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib79">Sheu and Stillman, 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib98">Yabuuchi et al., 2006</xref>). The role of DDK kinase Cdc7/Hsk1 is dependent upon its cell cycle regulated partner Dbf4/Dfp1 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">Jackson et al., 1993</xref>). DDK-dependent replication mechanisms are well studied across all model systems. However, whether DDK has any positive role in the replication stress response pathway is still a debate. In <italic>Saccharomyces cerevisiae (S. cerevisiae</italic>), reports show that Rad53 targets DDK to inhibit its kinase activity and limits late origin firing (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">Jares et al., 2000</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib43">Kihara et al., 2000</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib92">Tsuji et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib94">Weinreich and Stillman, 1999</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib103">Zegerman and Diffley, 2010</xref>). Similarly, in <italic>Schizosaccharomyces pombe (S. pombe</italic>), Cds1 phosphorylates Hsk1 upon HU treatment (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib59">Matsumoto et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib80">Snaith et al., 2000</xref>). However, the Rad53/Cds1 activation is reduced in the <italic>cdc7/hsk1-89</italic> mutant (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib100">Yamada et al., 2014</xref>). On the contrary, studies in humans show that DDK complex formation, chromatin association, and kinase activity are not perturbed after HU treatment (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib47">Lee et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib86">Tenca et al., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib92">Tsuji et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib99">Yamada et al., 2013</xref>). It has been reported that DDK helps initiate checkpoint signaling by aiding ssDNA formation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib78">Sasi et al., 2018</xref>). Recently, DDK inhibition has been shown to be detrimental for human cells in S-phase and its role in fork remodeling during replication stress has been established (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">Jones et al., 2021</xref>).</p><p>The fork protection complex (FPC) consists of three members Timeless (Tim)/Tipin/Claspin in human, Tof1/Csm3/Mrc1 in <italic>S. cerevisiae</italic> while Swi1/Swi3/Mrc1 in <italic>S. pombe</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Bastia et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib49">Leman and Noguchi, 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib68">Noguchi et al., 2004</xref>). The function of FPC is critical under conditions of fork stress and also during normal, unperturbed cell cycle (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib51">Lou et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib89">Tourrière et al., 2005</xref>). Another replisome factor, And-1/Ctf4/Mcl1 is also a part of FPC as it functions as pol alpha accessory factor (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Gosnell and Christensen, 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib85">Tanaka et al., 2009</xref>). It has been reported that the Tim and Claspin are overexpressed in cancers and help in adaptability under replication stress (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Bianco et al., 2019</xref>). The mechanisms regulating FPC in tumor cells are unknown. In <italic>S. pombe</italic>, deletion of <italic>hsk1</italic>, <italic>swi1,</italic> and <italic>swi3</italic> leads to decreased Cds1 activation. Hsk1 physically interacts with Swi1 and Swi3, however, it remains unclear how these proteins regulate replication stress response molecularly and whether they have functions independent of checkpoint (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Dolan et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib58">Matsumoto et al., 2005</xref>). It has also been shown that in the absence of FPC, there is a coordinated degradation of replisome components via proteasome (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib75">Roseaulin et al., 2013b</xref>). Protein degradation plays a pivotal role in the regulation of various cellular processes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">Hershko et al., 2000</xref>). The ubiquitin-proteasome system consists of a ubiquitin-activating enzyme (E1), ubiquitin-conjugating enzyme (E2), and ubiquitin ligase (E3) enzyme which polyubiquitinates the substrate proteins and marks them for degradation by the 26S proteasome. The E3 ubiquitin ligases recognize specific substrate proteins and target these for proteolysis. The ubiquitin ligase, SCF (Skp1-Cdc53/Cullin-1-F-box) which recognizes phosphorylated substrates, regulates several S phase events during cell cycle progression (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib71">Petroski and Deshaies, 2005</xref>).</p><p>The role of chromatin modifications and their regulators in replication stress response is less studied (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Fournier et al., 2018</xref>). The Sir2 family of conserved NAD<sup>+</sup>-dependent protein deacetylases comprises of three members, Sir2, Hst2, and Hst4 in <italic>S. pombe,</italic> whereas it has seven members in mammals (SIRT1-7) called sirtuins. Deletion of <italic>S. pombe hst4</italic> causes S phase delay and sensitivity to replication stress causing agents (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Haldar and Kamakaka, 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib45">Konada et al., 2018</xref>). Hst4 levels are downregulated during unperturbed S phase and on MMS treatment (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Haldar and Kamakaka, 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib45">Konada et al., 2018</xref>). <italic>S. pombe</italic> Hst4 and Hst3/Hst4 (budding yeast) functions in preserving genome integrity by directly deacetylating H3K56 and thereby affecting chromatin state (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib52">Maas et al., 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib57">Masumoto et al., 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib62">Miller et al., 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib96">Xhemalce et al., 2007</xref>){<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib52">Maas et al., 2006</xref> #29; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib57">Masumoto et al., 2005</xref> #30; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib52">Maas et al., 2006</xref> #29}. Acetylation of H3K56 is a cell cycle regulated modification and is required for cell survival, replication stress response and nucleosome assembly (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Han et al., 2007b</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib57">Masumoto et al., 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib97">Xu et al., 2005</xref>). Acetylation of H3K56 is catalyzed by Rtt109, an acetyl transferase which requires a H3-H4 chaperone, Asf1 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib82">Sutton et al., 2003</xref>) for this acetylation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Driscoll et al., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Han et al., 2007a</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Han et al., 2007b</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib73">Recht et al., 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib91">Tsubota et al., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib96">Xhemalce et al., 2007</xref>). H3K56ac is required for completion of DNA replication and acts in the branch of S phase checkpoint (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib87">Thaminy et al., 2007</xref>). H3K56ac is known as the activator of transcription as it helps in turnover of promoter-proximal nucleosomes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib88">Topal et al., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib97">Xu et al., 2005</xref>). The role of H3K56ac in mammals is less understood because it is not as abundant as it is in yeast (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Das et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib93">Vempati et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib102">Yuan et al., 2009</xref>).</p><p>In this report, we identified a positive role of DDK in regulating replication stress response which is independent of its checkpoint functions. We show that in response to fork stalling, DDK/Hsk1 phosphorylates Hst4 at C-terminal serine residues leading to the formation of phosphodegron for recognition by SCF<sup>pof3</sup> E3 ubiquitin ligase and degradation via proteasome. We establish that degradation of Hst4 helps in stabilization of FPC components, Swi1 and Mcl1 upon replication stress via H3K56 acetylation at the chromatin. We found that Hst4 exhibit synthetic genetic interaction and physical interaction with FPC components, Swi1 and Swi3 in vitro. Hst4 may regulate the expression of FPC components in an H3K56 acetylation-dependent manner. We have also observed that these functions are independent of intra-S phase checkpoint. Further, we have shown conservation of regulation of human FPC components via H3K56ac by knocking down Asf1 in U2OS cells. Taken together, our work revealed a potential role of H3K56ac in the regulation of FPC and established a positive role of DDK in regulating replication stress by modulating chromatin to stabilize DNA replication forks and thereby maintaining genome stability.</p></sec><sec id="s2" sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><sec id="s2-1"><title>DNA replication fork stalling cause downregulation of Hst4</title><p>The stability of DNA replication forks is maintained by an intricate interplay of the replisome, FPC and chromatin. We have previously shown that the level of sirtuin Hst4 decreases upon treatment with methylmethane sulfonate (MMS) which cause replication stress (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Haldar and Kamakaka, 2008</xref>). To test whether Hst4 level is specifically controlled in response to MMS or the cellular regulation in response to replication fork stalling, asynchronously grown wild-type <italic>S. pombe</italic> cells were treated with MMS as well as another replicative stress causing agent, Hydroxyurea (HU) which depletes dNTP pools to stall DNA replication. Hst4 was downregulated upon HU treatment similar to MMS (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1A</xref>). Further, we analyzed the kinetics of Hst4 downregulation upon MMS treatment and observed that it was downregulated after 90 min (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1B</xref>). The kinetics of regulation of Hst4 on HU treatment was similar to MMS (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1C</xref>). Since Hst4 is already known to be downregulated during the unperturbed S phase of the cell cycle, its level was examined on MMS treatment to check the degradation kinetics during the S phase in the presence of damage. Wild-type cells were synchronized at the G2 phase of the cell cycle and released in the S phase with and without MMS. Interestingly, the downregulation of Hst4 was accelerated by 30 min upon MMS treatment (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1D and E</xref>), although MMS slowed S phase progression as shown by the corresponding flow cytometry profiles of cell cycle progression (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1F</xref>). Unlike in untreated cells, where Hst4 can be observed at 60 min, on MMS treatment it is downregulated at this timepoint, however stable at 30 min (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1A, B</xref>). The S-phase progression was further confirmed by performing septation index analysis of the corresponding timepoints as shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1C</xref>. It has been previously reported that MMS-induced toxicity is dependent on replication and that MMS slows replication fork progression (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Cortez, 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib81">Stokes et al., 2002</xref>). To establish the dependence of regulation of Hst4 on DNA replication-induced stress, cells arrested at the G2 phase were treated with MMS and Hst4 level was examined. The Hst4 levels remained same in cells arrested at G2 phase upon MMS treatment while the asynchronous cells from the same genetic background showed downregulation of Hst4 upon MMS treatment (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1G</xref>). The corresponding flow cytometry profile is being shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1H</xref>. Overall, these results suggest that Hst4 level specifically decreased in response to DNA replication fork stalling during normal S phase as well as upon treatment with fork stalling agents.</p><fig-group><fig id="fig1" position="float"><label>Figure 1.</label><caption><title>Replication stress leads to downregulation of Hst4.</title><p>(<bold>A</bold>) Wild-type (wt) strain (ROP238) containing TAP-tagged Hst4 was grown to 0.5 O.D., treated with 0.015 % MMS and 10 mM HU for 2 hr, respectively, whole cell extracts were prepared and immunoblotted with anti-PAP antibody to detect TAP-tagged Hst4.

Therefore, we hypothesized that replication stress targets this chromatin regulator for degradation via the proteasome. To investigate the stability of Hst4 in wild-type cells, the half-life of the protein was determined in the presence or absence of MMS using cycloheximide (CHX), which blocks new protein synthesis. Hst4 was degraded at 120 minutes in untreated wild-type cells, whereas the proteolysis was accelerated upon MMS treatment (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2A</xref>), showing Hst4 was significantly degraded upon replicative stress. The corresponding quantitation from three independent experiments is shown in the <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s1">Figure 2—figure supplement 1B</xref>. To examine the role of proteasome in the degradation of Hst4, <italic>mts2-1</italic> temperature sensitive cells (in which proteasome is inactive at non-permissive temperature) carrying genomic TAP-tagged Hst4 (TAP-Hst4) were grown at non-permissive temperature and western blot was performed (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib83">Takayama et al., 2010</xref>). Hst4 was significantly stabilized in <italic>mts2-1</italic> strain in the absence or presence of MMS (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2B and C</xref>). We next investigated whether Hst4 is ubiquitinated in these cells. To pull down ubiquitinated proteins, these strains were transformed with pREP1-His6-ubiquitin or empty vector and Ni-NTA column was used to purify ubiquitinated proteins under denaturing conditions (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib83">Takayama et al., 2010</xref>). Hst4 was found to be ubiquitinated under normal as well as upon MMS treatment (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2D</xref>). Immunoblotting with anti-his antibody is shown as an expression control. Overall, these results demonstrate that Hst4 is ubiquitinated in vivo and degraded via the proteasome pathway. There are various mechanisms of proteasome dependent degradation of proteins. The mechanisms which operate in cell-cycle-dependent manner are APC and SCF-dependent E3 ubiquitin ligases (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">Hershko et al., 2000</xref>). Since, the regulation of Hst4 is dependent on S phase, we hypothesized that SCF E3 ubiquitin ligases could play a role in the phosphorylation dependent degradation of Hst4. Therefore, we performed bioinformatic analysis and observed potential phosphorylation sites at the C-terminus of Hst4. We made a truncated protein in which the C-terminal amino acids 353–415 are deleted. . The truncated protein was not degraded upon MMS treatment while its full-length counterpart was degraded, confirming the requirement of the C-terminal domain for degradtion of Hst4 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2E and F</xref>). We further deleted amino acids 398–415 (T1∆-Hst4) and 371–415 (T2∆-Hst4) and concluded that the minimum residues required for degradation are present between 352 and 370 amino acids as the truncations, T1 and T2 did not lead to complete stabilization of Hst4 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s1">Figure 2—figure supplement 1C,D</xref>). We have also studied the subcellular localization of FL-Hst4 and C∆-Hst4 and looked at the stability of these proteins upon MMS treatment by immunofluorescence. We observed that both the proteins are localizing perfectly to the nucleus, however, on MMS treatment, FL-Hst4 is degraded while C∆-Hst4 is stabilized (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2G</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s1">Figure 2—figure supplement 1E</xref>).

We have performed potential phosphorylation motif search using Eukaryotic Linear Motif (ELM) software which is used to search functional sites in proteins. Bioinformatics analysis of the C-terminus of Hst4 revealed putative consensus phosphorylation sites of Hsk1 and Gsk3-Beta in the C-terminus of the protein, therefore, we checked whether Hst4 is phosphorylated upon MMS treatment and targeted for degradation. To test whether Hst4 is phosphorylated upon MMS treatment, TAP-Hst4 was immunoprecipitated from the cells grown in the absence and presence of MMS and the phosphorylation status was checked with phosphoserine antibody. We observed phosphorylation of Hst4 at 1 hr of MMS treatment (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3A</xref>). We also subjected the immunoprecipitated Hst4 sample to lambda phosphatase treatment and observed appearance of a lower mobility form (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3B</xref>). To check whether Hst4 is phosphorylated in the unperturbed S-phase of the cell cycle, we blocked wild-type cells at G2 phase, then released into cell cycle synchronously and collected cells at G2, 30, 60, and 90 min. As our results had (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1D</xref>) indicated, Hst4 was degraded by 90 min. The TAP-Tagged Hst4 was immunoprecipitated and western blot was performed using phosphoserine antibody. Our results show that the phosphorylated band of Hst4 appears at 60 min (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3C</xref>). Next, we wanted to identify the kinase which phosphorylates Hst4. Since, the C-terminal of Hst4 contained sites of Gsk3-Beta, we checked the level of Hst4 in <italic>gsk3Δ</italic> cells after MMS treatment. The degradation of Hst4 was not affected significantly in <italic>gsk3Δ</italic> cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s1">Figure 3—figure supplement 1A</xref>). Hsk1 is a major regulator of DNA replication initiation, it also mediates intra-S phase checkpoint response to DNA replication stress (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib58">Matsumoto et al., 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib59">Matsumoto et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib80">Snaith et al., 2000</xref>). Since, Hst4 was degraded in a replication dependent manner and putative Hsk1 kinase sites were present in the C-terminus of Hst4; the levels of Hst4 were determined in the <italic>hsk1-89</italic> in which Hsk1 is active at 25 degrees but inactive at 30 degrees centigrade. Hst4 was significantly stable in this mutant even after 4 hr of MMS treatment (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3D</xref>). To check whether the level of Hst4 is altered in mutants where replication initiation is prevented, we checked the level of Hst4 in another replication initiation protein, <italic>mcm4</italic> temperature-sensitive mutant (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib59">Matsumoto et al., 2010</xref>), we found that Hst4 is degraded in response to replication stress in this strain at non-permissive temperature indicating Hsk1 kinase specifically regulates Hst4 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s1">Figure 3—figure supplement 1B</xref>). To further substantiate our results, we complemented <italic>hsk1-89</italic> with wild-type Hsk1 and kinase-dead Hsk1 (K129D) cloned in pSLF272 vector and found that Hst4 degradation is rescued upon wild-type Hsk1 expression; however, the kinase-dead Hsk1 is unable to do so (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3E</xref>). The expression of Hsk1 was checked by probing the extracts with anti-HA antibody (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s1">Figure 3—figure supplement 1C</xref>). There is a controversy regarding the chromatin association of DDK upon replication stress. In lower eukaryotes, it has been shown that Dbf4 (SpDfp1) and Cdc7 (SpHsk1) is dissociated from the chromatin upon replication stress; however, this is not seen in mammalian cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib86">Tenca et al., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib99">Yamada et al., 2013</xref>). To know the status of DDK in <italic>S. pombe</italic> upon replication stress, we performed chromatin fractionation of untreated and MMS treated wild-type cells. Our results have shown that neither Dfp1 nor Hsk1 is dissociated from the chromatin upon replication stress; however, we observed a significant reduction of chromatin-bound Hst4 upon MMS treatment as expected due to downregulation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3F</xref>). Next, we also immunoprecipitated Hst4 from both wild-type and <italic>hsk1-89</italic> mutant strain and looked into the phosphorylation status of Hst4 upon MMS treatment. We did not find any phosphorylated band of Hst4 in <italic>hsk1-89</italic> cells confirming that Hst4 to be the target of Hsk1 on MMS treatment (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3G</xref>). The next question we asked was whether Hsk1 forms a complex with Hst4. We were unable to detect Hsk1 and Hst4 interaction in vivo indicating transient interaction. We therefore performed crosslinking by 1 % formaldehyde treatment and observed that Hst4 interacts with DDK only upon treatment with 0.015 % MMS in the wild-type cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3H</xref>). To check in vitro interaction, we expressed and purified recombinant his-tagged Hst4 using Ni-NTA column, coimmunoprecipitated HA tagged-Hsk1 which also contains Dfp1-myc from HU-treated fission yeast cells using anti-HA antibody and incubated the proteins together and subjected to western blot. Our results show that Hsk1-Dfp1 forms a complex with Hst4 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3I</xref>). Finally, we performed an in vitro kinase assay as described in materials and methods and observed that Hsk1 phosphorylates Hst4 as heat inactivation of kinase lead to loss of phosphorylation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3J</xref>). The immunoprecipitated Hsk1 under the same conditions was run on gel and western blot was performed (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s1">Figure 3—figure supplement 1D</xref>). Overall, these results suggest that Hst4 is a physiological substrate of Hsk1, which targets it for degradation via phosphorylation.</p><fig-group><fig id="fig3" position="float"><label>Figure 3.</label><caption><title>Replication-dependent regulation of Hst4 via phosphorylation by DDK/Hsk1.</title><p>(<bold>A</bold>) wt strain (ROP238) containing TAP-tagged Hst4 was grown to 0.5 O.D., treated with 0.015 % MMS for 1 hr and samples were immunoprecipitated using IgG-sepharose beads and western blot was performed with phosphoserine antibody.

The result in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s1">Figure 4—figure supplement 1D</xref> show that <italic>4SA-hst4</italic> has higher recovery defect as compared to FL-Hst4 and other mutants in response to MMS treatment suggesting all four serine residues are phosphorylated to form a degron for degradation. Finally, we have checked the survival and sensitivity of endogenously expressed <italic>4SA-hst4</italic> mutant upon replication stress. We have performed spot assay to check the growth rate and survival upon MMS and HU treatment. As shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4F</xref>, we found that cells expressing <italic>4SA-hst4</italic> are slow growing and sensitive to replication stress as compared to wild-type. We observed significant difference in sensitivity to MMS and HU on Day 3, however, on longer growth duration, cells adapted to MMS. We do not see such adaptation in presence of HU. The survival without stress is affected in <italic>4SA-hst4</italic> mutant, due to the cell cycle dependent regulation of Hst4 during S phase. To further quantitatively determine cell survival post replication stress we have treated cells with MMS and HU for indicated timepoints, cells were washed and then plated on fresh YES plates and colonies were counted. The results in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4G and H</xref> show that <italic>4SA-hst4</italic> has significant growth recovery defect as compared to wild-type. We have observed that treatment with HU leads to more sensitivity and recovery defects in <italic>4SA-hst4</italic> mutant cells than on treatment with MMS. Overall, our results show that dynamic regulation of Hst4 is required to maintain genome stability.</p></sec><sec id="s2-6"><title>SCF(Pof3) mediated degradation of Hst4 in response to replication stress</title><p>The degradation of S phase specific substrates is targeted mainly via SCF class of E3 ubiquitin ligases which contain a Skp1/cullin core associated with the Rbx1 RING finger protein and a F box protein. The substrate specificity determinant of SCF complex is the F- box protein, which recognize sphosphorylated Ser/Thr in the target protein. . Fission yeast contains 18 ORFs encoding F-box proteins (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Hermand, 2006</xref>). However, only a few of them have been characterized. We checked the stability of Hst4 in the absence of Pof3 (ScDia2), which is known to regulate DNA replication stress-related processes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib75">Roseaulin et al., 2013b</xref>), by constructing a TAP-tagged Hst4 strain in the <italic>pof3Δ</italic> background. We found that Hst4 was significantly stabilized in the <italic>pof3Δ</italic> cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5A</xref>). We have also looked at the level of Hst4 in the <italic>pop1Δ</italic> which is a F box protein known to affect cell ploidy (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib48">Lehmann et al., 2004</xref>); however, we could not find stabilization of Hst4, suggesting Pof3 is specifically required for the stabilization of Hst4 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5s1">Figure 5—figure supplement 1A</xref>). Further, we have examined the half-life of Hst4 in the <italic>pof3Δ</italic> using CHX in the presence of MMS and observed that the half life of Hst4 was significantly increased in <italic>pof3Δ</italic> compared to wild-type (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5B</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5s1">Figure 5—figure supplement 1B</xref>). Next, we confirmed the role of SCF<sup>pof3</sup> in the degradation of Hst4 by checking the levels of Hst4 in <italic>skp1-94</italic> which is specifically defective in interaction with Pof3 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib74">Roseaulin et al., 2013a</xref>). Our results show that Hst4 is significantly stabilized in <italic>skp1-94</italic> (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5C</xref>). We did not observe stabilization of Hst4 in the <italic>skp1-A4</italic> strain where Skp1 interaction with Pof3 is intact (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib48">Lehmann et al., 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5s1">Figure 5—figure supplement 1C</xref>). Finally, we checked for interaction between Hst4 and Pof3 by expressing HA-Pof3 in <italic>mts2-1</italic> strain, where Hst4 is stabilized and performing coimmunoprecipitation using anti-HA antibody to pull down Pof3 after MMS treatment. We observed that Hst4 interacts with Pof3 in <italic>mts2-1</italic> strain without replication stress as well as upon MMS treatment (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5D</xref>). This result suggests that Hst4 and Pof3 interaction occurs in the unperturbed S-phase cells as well. Next, we performed coimmunoprecipitation with cell extracts from MMS treated and untreated cells expressing HA-Pof3, using anti-HA antibody to check whether these proteins interact in the wild-type cells. We observed that pof3 interacts with Hst4 only in the presence of MMS in the wild-type cells upon 1 hr of treatment (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5E</xref>). It is known that E3 ubiquitin ligases are tightly regulated by various mechanisms. Since we observed Hst4 degradation upon treatment with HU and MMS, we checked the level of Pof3 upon treatment with MMS and HU. Interestingly, we found that the Pof3 protein levels were upregulated upon MMS and HU treatment in wild-type cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5F</xref>). Overall, these results further substantiate our findings on the regulation of Hst4 and establish the role of SCF<sup>pof3</sup> in the degradation of Hst4 in response to replication stress.</p><fig-group><fig id="fig5" position="float"><label>Figure 5.</label><caption><title>SCF<sup>Pof3</sup>-mediated degradation of Hst4 on replication stress.</title><p>(<bold>A</bold>) wt strain (ROP238) and F box mutant strain <italic>pof3Δ</italic> (DHP35) containing TAP-tagged Hst4 were grown to 0.5 O.D., treated with 0.015 % MMS for 2 hr and whole cell extracts were prepared and immunoblotted with anti-PAP antibody.

We performed the morphological analysis of both wild-type and 4SA-<italic>hst4</italic> after replication stress via Hydroxyurea-induced S phase arrest. We found a high amount of DNA fragmentation and septated cells shown by DNA staining after 6 hr of HU treatment indicating aberrant mitosis while wild-type cells were arrested, as indicated by the appearance of elongated, uninucleate cells without septa (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6A</xref>). Since, we observed slow growth and loss of viability upon mutation of <italic>4SA-hst4</italic>, we studied the cell cycle progression upon the G2 block and release into the S phase in this mutant. We observed a delay in S-phase progression in this mutant (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6B</xref>). These results indicate that degradation of Hst4 is important for maintaining genome stability during the unperturbed S phase as well as upon replication stress. Earlier observations with checkpoint proteins like <italic>mrc1</italic> and <italic>rad53</italic> have shown that lack of proper regulation leads to delayed recovery and defective restart of forks. Since Hst4 is degraded in response to replication stress; we wanted to understand the recovery kinetics after replication fork stalling. For this purpose, H2A phosphorylation status was checked as a marker of DNA damage on MMS treatment and after the removal of MMS during recovery. We found that H2A phosphorylation was reduced by 3 hr during recovery in wild-type whereas it persists in <italic>4SA-hst4</italic> (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6C</xref>). These results suggest that degradation of Hst4 is required for recovery from replication stress. We have also synchronized cells in G2 phase and checked the cell cycle progression after HU-induced cell cycle arrest, to study fork recovery through flow cytometry. We observed that the wild-type cells finished S-phase and resumed cell cycle progression, however, the <italic>4SA-hst4</italic> showed delayed S-phase progression which further confirms the inability of this mutant to recover from HU-induced replication stress (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6s1">Figure 6—figure supplement 1A</xref>). Further, we looked for recovery from replication stress in this strain by checking restart efficiency after replication stress through sequential incorporation of halogenated nucleotide analogs CldU and IdU and looked for colocalization. We marked replicating cells with CldU and then treated them with 12 mM HU for 2 hr and resumed replication by removing the drug and providing fresh medium with IdU. The results in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6D and E</xref> show that the IdU:CldU ratio is significantly lower in <italic>4SA-hst4</italic> than that in wild-type indicating the critical need for degradation of Hst4 for fork restart. The initial replication foci detected by CldU was found to be similar in both wild-type and <italic>4SA-hst4</italic> implying that the early replication is not hampered in the <italic>4SA-hst4</italic> mutant. We have performed the restart efficiency using single analog labeling by BrdU post MMS treatment recovery in the S phase and observed that only 25 percent of cells were recovered from the stress whereas wild-type cells efficiently recovered and restarted (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6s1">Figure 6—figure supplement 1B,C</xref>).

Our data indicated that replication forks are not appropriately stalled in response to replication stress, and therefore, cells are unable to resume DNA replication efficiently. The FPC has a critical role in the stabilization of replication forks. Deficiency of FPC components Swi1 and Swi3 cause high Rad22 (Rad52) repair foci and slow S phase progression (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib68">Noguchi et al., 2004</xref>). The <italic>hst4∆</italic> cells also exhibit similar phenotypes as shown in our earlier work (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib45">Konada et al., 2018</xref>). Therefore, we asked whether FPC components, <italic>swi1, swi3,</italic> and <italic>hst4</italic> interact genetically. We made double mutants of <italic>swi1∆hst4∆</italic> and <italic>swi3∆hst4∆</italic> and found that the combination is synthetic lethal as we could not recover spores (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7A</xref>). This result indicates that these genes are functioning in parallel pathways. To check whether there is physical interaction between Hst4 and Swi1-Swi3, Swi1-FLAG and Swi3-FLAG proteins were immunoprecipitated from untreated or MMS treated fission yeast cells and incubated with recombinant Fl-Hst4. We observed that Hst4 physically interacts with Swi1 and Swi3 in vitro (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7B</xref>). Since Hst4 is degraded upon replication stress and during S phase where these proteins have a crucial role, we hypothesized that Hst4 targets these at the chromatin via direct deacetylation. To sought that, we immunoprecipitated Swi1 and Swi3 upon MMS treatment and looked for acetylation. We did not find the acetylation of Swi1 and Swi3 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7s1">Figure 7—figure supplement 1A</xref>). We checked the whole cell levels of FPC in <italic>4SA-hst4</italic> mutant and interestingly found that Swi1 is significantly overexpressed when Hst4 was not degraded (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7C</xref>). Mcl1, the homolog of human And-1 is also a part of FPC in higher eukaryotes. Therefore, we looked at the levels of Mcl1 and overexpression of Mcl1 was observed. The quantitation of the data is shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7s1">Figure 7—figure supplement 1B,C</xref>. The replication protein Mrc1 is also part of the fork protection complex.

We have observed that Mrc1 is also upregulated in the <italic>4SA-hst4</italic> strain (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7s1">Figure 7—figure supplement 1D</xref>). We have also looked at the expression of PCNA, which is a clamp protein, crucial for DNA replication. We did not find altered expression of PCNA in <italic>4SA-hst4</italic> strain upon treatment with both MMS and HU which shows specific regulation of Swi1 and Mcl1 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7s1">Figure 7—figure supplement 1E</xref>, F).

Our results indicate that H3K56ac is drastically reduced in both <italic>hsk1-89</italic> and <italic>pof3∆</italic> strains as a consequence of constitutive Hst4 expression in these strains (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8s1">Figure 8—figure supplement 1A, B</xref>). Our results so far show the <italic>S. pombe</italic> DDK and H3K56ac-dependent regulation of FPC stability and chromatin association. It has been previously reported that the levels of FPC are highly upregulated in various types of cancer (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Bianco et al., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Chi et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib101">Yoshida et al., 2013</xref>). To check the conservation of regulation of FPC, we studied the levels of FPC upon knock down of Asf1a which regulates H3K56ac in the human U2OS cell line. We performed western blot to study the whole cell levels of FPC. Our results show that upon Asf1a knock down, there was a significant reduction of FPC components Tim, Tipin, and And-1 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8">Figure 8D</xref>). Since, H3K56ac is regulated by sirtuins, we checked the level of Sirtuin 2 and found that level of Sirtuin 2 was not altered upon Asf1 knock down. To confirm these results, we performed chromatin fractionation upon Asf1a knock down in U2OS cells. Our results revealed a significant decrease in the chromatin-bound Tim and And-1 consistent with the reduction in whole cell levels (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8">Figure 8E</xref>). Overall, these results indicate that the regulation of FPC association to the chromatin via H3K56ac is conserved in human cells.</p><fig-group><fig id="fig8" position="float"><label>Figure 8.</label><caption><title>H3K56 acetylation-dependent stabilization of Fork Protection Complex at the chromatin regulates genomic stability.</title><p>(<bold>A</bold>) wt strain (ROP238) and <italic>4SA-hst4</italic> strain (DHP146) were grown to 0.5 O.D., treated with 0.015 % MMS for 2 hr, whole cell extracts were prepared and immunoblotted with indicated antibodies.

In S-phase or upon replication stress, DDK/Hsk1 interacts with Hst4 and phosphorylates it at serine residues at the C-terminus. The phosphorylated Hst4 is recognized and ubiquitinated by SCF<sup>pof3</sup> ubiquitin ligase and degraded via proteasome. Degradation of Hst4 increases H3K56ac levels leading to stable maintenance of FPC Swi1 and Mcl1 at the chromatin which helps in fork recovery and cell survival.</p><p><supplementary-material id="fig8sdata1"><label>Figure 8—source data 1.</label><caption><title>Uncropped western blot images for <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8">Figure 8A–E</xref>.</title></caption><media mime-subtype="zip" mimetype="application" xlink:href="elife-70787-fig8-data1-v2.zip"/></supplementary-material></p><p><supplementary-material id="fig8sdata2"><label>Figure 8—source data 2.</label><media mime-subtype="zip" mimetype="application" xlink:href="elife-70787-fig8-data2-v2.zip"/></supplementary-material></p></caption><graphic mime-subtype="tiff" mimetype="image" xlink:href="elife-70787-fig8-v2.tif"/></fig><fig id="fig8s1" position="float" specific-use="child-fig"><label>Figure 8—figure supplement 1.</label><caption><title>Hypoacetylation of histone H3K56 in <italic>hsk1-89</italic> and <italic>pof3</italic> mutant cells.</title><p>(<bold>A</bold>) The wt (ROP238), <italic>hsk1-89</italic> (DHP78) and H3K56R strain (ROP253) were grown to mid-log phase, whole cell extracts were prepared and western blot was performed.

The FPC stabilizes the paused replisome via its association with MCM2 of the CMG helicase ahead of the fork which prevent fork rotation. Phosphorylation of MCM and Tof1 by DDK at the stalled fork, is required for fork stabilization in budding yeast (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Bastia et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib40">Kaplan and Bastia, 2009</xref>). DDK, a conserved serine/threonine kinase has a significant role in the initiation of DNA replication. Studies in yeast provide substantial evidence that DDK participates in the S-phase checkpoint activation, however, it is also a target of the S phase checkpoint (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib70">Ogi et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib80">Snaith et al., 2000</xref>). There are contrasting reports on the role of DDK under replication stress (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">Jones et al., 2021</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib92">Tsuji et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib100">Yamada et al., 2014</xref>). Here, we report that DDK/Hsk1 phosphorylates sirtuin Hst4 in response to replication stress to target it for proteasomal degradation through SCF<sup>Pof3</sup> ubiquitin ligase to regulate replication fork recovery. The cells expressing non-degradable mutant <italic>4SA-hst4</italic> show reduced H3K56ac due to constitutive expression of Hst4. We propose that DDK/Hsk1 phosphorylates and targets Hst4 for degradation via SCF<sup>Pof3</sup> increasing H3K56ac, which facilitates stable association of FPC and its functions in stable fork stalling (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8">Figure 8</xref>). We have shown that reduction in H3K56ac results in loss of FPC in human U2OS cells, indicating conservation of this mechanism, paving the path for therapeutic intervention as FPC is known to be upregulated in various cancers (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Bianco et al., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Chi et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib61">Mazzoccoli et al., 2011</xref>).</p><p>The genome integrity is constantly challenged by both exogenous as well as endogenous sources of replication stress. The major sensor of replication stress Rad3 (ATR in humans) gets activated upon sensing stalled replication forks and activates specific signaling pathways in response to combat it (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Cimprich and Cortez, 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Cortez, 2005</xref>). The more recent evidence suggests S phase checkpoint-independent mechanisms also exist that contribute to the maintenance of fork stability (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Bianco et al., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Feng et al., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib90">Tourrière and Pasero, 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib89">Tourrière et al., 2005</xref>). In <italic>S. pombe,</italic> it has been shown that in the absence of FPC component <italic>swi1∆</italic>, cells mediate proteasome dependent degradation of replisome components to prevent fork collapse (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib75">Roseaulin et al., 2013b</xref>). We have earlier shown that sirtuin Hst4 gets downregulated in the S-phase of the cell cycle (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Haldar and Kamakaka, 2008</xref>). Here, we have shown that Hst4 gets targeted for degradation upon replication fork stalling during unperturbed S phase or exogenously caused by MMS and HU. This process is dependent upon DNA replication as we failed to observe downregulation in G2 cells with damage (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1</xref>). The DNA replication dependent phenomenon is due to the activity of DDK kinase, which is majorly active in the S phase of the cell cycle (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib60">Matthews and Guarné, 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib72">Ramer et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib76">Rossbach et al., 2017</xref>). There are not many substrates of DDK known which indicate its function in replication stress response. In <italic>S. cerevisiae</italic>, it has been shown that DDK complex formation and activity is inhibited upon replication stress (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib43">Kihara et al., 2000</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib92">Tsuji et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib94">Weinreich and Stillman, 1999</xref>). However, more recently, it was shown that programmed fork arrest requires phosphorylation of MCM as well as Tof1 by DDK (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Bastia et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib77">Rowlands et al., 2017</xref>).This phosphorylation is required for association of Tof1 with the replisome. In this study, we have observed that the DDK complex is intact upon replication stress and it actively phosphorylates sirtuin Hst4 upon MMS treatment (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3</xref>) in fission yeast, <italic>S. pombe</italic>. Studies in mammalian cells have also shown that DDK kinase activity and complex formation is retained and required for protecting replication forks upon replication stress (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib47">Lee et al., 2012</xref>). Most recent evidence has implicated the role of mammalian DDK in the replication fork restart following stalling of forks (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">Jones et al., 2021</xref>). DDK prefers S/T residues close to acidic amino acids such as aspartate and glutamate for phosphorylation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Cho et al., 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib55">Masai and Arai, 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib56">Masai et al., 2006</xref>). We observed <italic>S. pombe</italic> DDK/Hsk1 kinase phosphorylates serine residues S354, S355, S362, and S363 at the C-terminus of Hst4, the serines 354 and 355 are adjacent to acidic residue glutamic acid (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4</xref>). We confirmed the stabilization of Hst4 by making a mutant <italic>4SA-hst4</italic>, in whichall four serines are mutated to alanines resulting in stabilization of Hst4 and loss of phosphorylation by DDK (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4</xref>). It is to be noted that we could detect the interaction of DDK with Hst4 only upon formaldehyde crosslinking in vivo, indicating that this interaction is transient in cells. The phosphorylated residues at the C-terminus of Hst4 form a phosphodegron in order to be recognized by E3 ubiquitin ligase SCF<sup>Pof3</sup>, where the F-box protein Pof3 recognizes phosphorylated Hst4 and degrades it via ubiquitin-dependent proteolysis (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figures 2</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">5</xref>). The SCF family of E3 ubiquitin ligases are very well conserved in evolution and regulate wide variety of proteins, they are also implicated in cancers (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib50">Liu et al., 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib65">Nakayama and Nakayama, 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib67">Nguyen and Busino, 2020</xref>). Pof3 regulates replication stress responses in <italic>S. pombe</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib41">Katayama et al., 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib54">Mamnun et al., 2006</xref>). The <italic>S. cerevisiae</italic> homolog of Pof3, Dia2 is also a regulator of replisome integrity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Blake et al., 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib53">Maculins et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib63">Mimura et al., 2009</xref>). While our work was in progress, reports on the degradation of <italic>S. cerevisiae</italic> Hst3, one of the functional homolog of <italic>S. pombe</italic> Hst4, were published (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Delgoshaie et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Edenberg et al., 2014</xref>). The degradation of Hst3 in <italic>S. cerevisiae</italic> is, however, carried out by a different E3 ubiquitin ligase and also the kinase phosphorylating Hst3 is different from Hsk1 indicating that the degradation mechanisms of Hst3 of <italic>S. cerevisiae</italic> and Hst4 of <italic>S. pombe</italic> are different. Our results have shown for the first time that Pof3 itself is regulated upon replication stress. We found higher protein levels of Pof3 upon both MMS and HU treatment, whereas Hst4 is targeted for degradation under the same conditions (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5F</xref>). However, the mechanism of regulation of Pof3 upon replication stress is at present not clear and could be studied in future. In <italic>S. pombe</italic>, Pof3 and Hsk1 are known to regulate histone homeostasis via regulating the proteasome-dependent degradation of Ams2, the first report suggesting that DDK regulates the stability of proteins (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib83">Takayama et al., 2010</xref>). We believe the major function of DDK is not limited to the regulation of DNA replication, in fact, DDK is a master regulator of major DNA transactions in the cell including, DNA damage checkpoint, cohesion, homologous recombination, histone homeostasis, etc. (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Furuya et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib78">Sasi et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib83">Takayama et al., 2010</xref>). Our findings would help highlight the positive role of DDK/Hsk1 in regulating replication stress response in chromatin context specifically in <italic>S. pombe</italic> and higher eukaryotes.</p><p>High amount of DNA fragmentation and recovery defects were observed when we expressed, mutant hst4, <italic>4SA-hst4,</italic> which was not degraded upon replication stress (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6</xref>). The <italic>4SA-hst4</italic> mutant shows delayed S-phase progression as indicated by the FACS profile. Our results have also shown replication fork restart defect in <italic>4SA-hst4</italic> using dual labelling with BrdU analog co-localization experiments (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6</xref>). The <italic>4SA-hst4</italic> mutant is not defective in initial CldU foci formation indicating that <italic>4SA-hst4</italic> does not have a DNA replication initiation defect. Tim, Tipin, Claspin, and And1 have been identified as members of the Replication Pausing complex (RPC), also known as FPC, which moves with the replisome and preserves replisome integrity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Cho et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Chou and Elledge, 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Errico et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Errico et al., 2007</xref>). The role in preserving the integrity of the replication fork goes beyond their function in checkpoint activation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Errico and Costanzo, 2012</xref>). The synthetic lethality of <italic>hst4∆swi1∆ and hst4∆swi3∆</italic> observed in our study suggests that Hst4 functions in parallel with the FPC. We have earlier observed in <italic>hst4∆</italic> cells, high incidence of Rad22 foci formation in the unperturbed S phase and delayed S-phase (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib45">Konada et al., 2018</xref>). These defects are similar to the those seen in <italic>swi1∆</italic> and <italic>swi3∆</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib68">Noguchi et al., 2004</xref>). Our current study shows that Hst4 exhibit synthetic genetic interaction and direct physical interaction with Swi1 and Swi3 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7</xref>). The whole cell levels of Swi1 and Mcl1 are both upregulated in <italic>4SA-hst4</italic> mutant. This result is consistent with our earlier study which shows that deletion of <italic>hst4</italic> (hyperacetylation of H3K56) leads to reduced Mcl1 levels (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib45">Konada et al., 2018</xref>). Interestingly, the chromatin association of these proteins is reduced upon fork stalling in <italic>4SA-hst4</italic> mutant, indicating phosphorylation of Hst4 is required for their chromatin retention and fork stabilization function. Since Hst4 is a protein deacetylase, we hypothesized Swi1 and Swi3 could be its substrates; however, we did not detect direct deacetylation of these components. It is known that H3K56 acetylation is involved in the proper response to replication stress and recovery and thus completion of DNA replication (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Han et al., 2007a</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Han et al., 2007b</xref>). During the normal cell cycle, H3K56 is deacetylated in G2/M phase (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib52">Maas et al., 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib57">Masumoto et al., 2005</xref>). This deacetylation requires Hst3 and Hst4 in <italic>S. cerevisae</italic>, Sir2 family deacetylases (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib52">Maas et al., 2006</xref>). Cells lacking Hst3 and Hst4 are sensitive to genotoxic agents that impede replication-fork progression and exhibit a high incidence of mitotic chromosome loss and replication-linked spontaneous DNA damage (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib57">Masumoto et al., 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib95">Wurtele et al., 2012</xref>). Thus, the acetylation of new histones is a double-edged sword. It has also been shown that <italic>hst3 hst4</italic> of <italic>S. cerevisiae</italic> genetically interacts with Csm3 and Tof1, the homologs of Swi1 and Swi3; however, how these proteins converge in a single pathway of replication stress is not known (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib87">Thaminy et al., 2007</xref>). Recent Cryo-EM of FPC suggest that Tof1/Csm3 is present ahead of CMG complex and interacts with double-stranded DNA (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Baretić et al., 2020</xref>). It will be interesting to check the interaction of FPC with nucleosomal DNA. We observed hypoacetylated H3K56 in the <italic>4SA-hst4</italic> as well as in <italic>hsk1-89</italic> and <italic>pof3Δ</italic> as there is constitutive expression of Hst4. Therefore; we hypothesized that the observed reduction of FPC at the chromatin and regulation of expression depends upon H3K56 acetylation. Our results in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8">Figure 8</xref> have shown that the observed depletion of FPC at the chromatin in the <italic>4SA-hst4</italic> is indeed dependent on H3K56 acetylation as we observed similar destabilization of Swi1 and Mcl1 at the chromatin in H3K56R mutant. The whole cell levels of Swi1 and Mcl1 are also increased in H3K56R mutant indicating regulation via H3K56 acetylation. Swi1 and Swi3 have recently been shown to regulate histone H4 acetylation and physically interact with vid21 subunit of NuA4 acetyltransferase (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib69">Noguchi et al., 2019</xref>). Our study has further linked Swi1 and Swi3 to histone H3K56 acetylation and thereby promoting stalled replication fork stability. The <italic>4SA-hst4</italic> mutant has hypoacetylation of H3K56 without any exogenous replication stress indicating that forks are hypoacetylated during the unperturbed S phase, leading to cell survival defect. It is well known that the checkpoint sensor, ATR deletion leads to cell lethality indicating that ATR is active during normal S phase (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Cimprich and Cortez, 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Cortez, 2015</xref>). The intrinsically challenged forks, therefore, need to be stabilized. It is also possible that in <italic>4SA-hst4</italic> mutant, chromatin is prone to collapse due to lower H3K56ac and higher expression of FPC. The evidence for this comes from the study where it has been shown that hypoacetylation of H3K56ac leads to reduced replisome components Pol €, Rfc3, and PCNA at the replication fork (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Han et al., 2007b</xref>). Swi1 and Swi3 are known to localize in rDNA and late replicating regions and Hst4 was also observed to be localized at telomere and rDNA locus earlier (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Chang et al., 2011</xref>). These interactions may occur in heterochromatic regions as they are prone to collapse. It is not clear yet how loss of H3K56ac leads to defective fork protection complex retention or stability at the chromatin. Further studies need to be done to know the chromatin links of FPC. A recent report has shown that cancerous cells upregulate the level of Timeless (SpSwi1) and Claspin (SpMrc1) to protect from endogenous replication stress (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Bianco et al., 2019</xref>). We have found that the reduced levels of FPC at the chromatin, is still able to activate intra-S phase checkpoint indicating that the basal levels of FPC are enough to activate checkpoint. Similar results were obtained by <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Bianco et al., 2019</xref> wherein they show the residual levels of FPC are sufficient to activate checkpoint. It is believed that proteins of the RPC/FPC coordinate DNA polymerase and helicase activities at the stalled replication fork (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Errico et al., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Gambus et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib42">Katou et al., 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib66">Nedelcheva et al., 2005</xref>). Tim-Tipin inhibits helicase activity and stimulates pol activity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Cho et al., 2013</xref>). During replication stress, this function becomes important to prevent excess ssDNA formation and double-strand breaks (DSBs). The non-degradable Hst4 leads to reduced FPC at the chromatin thereby the helicase and DNA polymerase uncoupling will lead to fork collapse and excess breaks indicated by high H2A-P, DNA fragmentation and defective restart in <italic>4SA-hst4</italic> mutant. The recent reports on chromatin modifications at the replication fork also show that DNA polymerase and helicase activities at the fork are coordinated independent of checkpoint (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Feng et al., 2019</xref>). We believe, apart from the upstream players of checkpoint, the major functional module is dictated by these downstream players like FPC which help stabilize replication forks.</p><p>Finally, we show the conservation of regulation of FPC via the H3K56ac pathway in human U2OS cells. Upon knockdown of Asf1a, a H3-H4 chaperone which is required for H3K56ac, we found reduction in the expression of Timeless, Tipin, and And1. The chromatin levels of FPC were also drastically reduced in Asf1a knock-down conditions. This finding is important because the FPC components Timeless and Claspin have been shown to have elevated expression in cancer cells including U2OS cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Bianco et al., 2019</xref>). These proteins are controlled both transcriptionally and post-translationally (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Errico and Costanzo, 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib105">Zhang et al., 2017</xref>). Although Asf1a could have other functions such as nucleosome assembly, however, knock down of Asf1a here is carried out specifically, to reduce H3K56ac. The mechanism of regulation of expression of FPC via H3K56ac is currently unclear. Also the difference in the expression pattern of FPC in yeast versus mammals is intriguing. The role of H3K56ac in the regulation of transcription is well known. Interestingly, recent reports have shown that H3K56ac can have opposing effects on the transcription of genes depending upon the context of chromatin and crosstalks with other histone marks (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Cote et al., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib88">Topal et al., 2019</xref>). It will be interesting to study the molecular mechanism of regulation of FPC via H3K56ac in the future. Overall, our study has shown a novel role of H3K56ac in the regulation of FPC which opens up a promising pathway to therapeutic intervention for treating cancer.</p></sec><sec id="s4" sec-type="materials|methods"><title>Materials and methods</title><sec id="s4-1"><title>Yeast strains, media, and growth conditions</title><p>Fission yeast strains used in this study are listed in <xref ref-type="table" rid="table1">Table 1</xref>.

stability. This manuscript has employed a combination of biochemistry, molecular and genetics studies to establish that, in <italic>S. pombe</italic>, the histone deacetylase Hst4 is targeted by DDK for proteosomal degradation during unchallenged DNA replication and in response to replication blocking agents. Preventing Hst4 degradation leads to a lower level of the histone mark H3K56Ac and impairs Swi1 and Mcl1, two components of the fork protection complex, association to chromatin, leading to stalled forks more prone to collapse. Finally, key experiments are provided to establish that reduced level of H3K56Ac in U2OS cells results in downregulation of fork protection complex.</p><p><bold>Decision letter after peer review:</bold></p><p>[Editors’ note: the authors submitted for reconsideration following the decision after peer review. What follows is the decision letter after the first round of review.]</p><p>Thank you for submitting your work entitled &quot;DDK/Hsk1 Phosphorylates and Targets Histone Deacetylase Hst4 for Degradation to Stabilize Stalled DNA Replication Forks&quot; for consideration by <italic>eLife</italic>. Your article has been reviewed by 3 peer reviewers, including Jerry L Workman as the Reviewing Editor and Reviewer #1, and the evaluation has been overseen by a Senior Editor.</p><p>Our decision has been reached after consultation between the reviewers. Based on these discussions and the individual reviews below, we regret to inform you that your work will not be considered further for publication in <italic>eLife</italic>.</p><p>The reviewers found the work interesting and the discovery of DDK phosphorylation of Hst4 during replication stress important. The reviewers felt that in principle the work is significant enough for consideration at <italic>eLife</italic>. There were however issues with the manuscript that preclude its being accepted, these include issues with the quality of some of the data, issues with apparent contradictions in some of the data and whether a strong enough case was made to conclude that Hst4 phosphorylation by DDK is replication stress activated. While the reviewers felt that with time you would be able to address many of the comments in the reviews this would clearly take longer than the three months allowed for revisions at <italic>eLife</italic>. Hence the manuscript has to be rejected. While this version of the manuscript is rejected, a new version of this story may be appropriate for <italic>eLife</italic> at some point in the future.</p><p><italic>Reviewer #1:</italic></p><p>This study in fission yeast found that the histone deacetylase hst4 is phosphorylated by the Hsk1 kinase upon replication stress. This leads to degradation of hst4 by the SCF ligase and the proteasome. H3K56 is deacetylated by hst4 and this modification is required at stalled replication forks for the resolution of the stalled forks and progression through S phase.</p><p>This is a systematic study that logically proceeds through the various steps in this pathway through a nice combination of biochemistry and genetics.</p><p>My major concern is that some of the western blots shown are of poor quality. This dampens confidence on the reproducibility of some experiments if these are the best repeats. The following blots should be repeated.</p><p>Figures 3E, 4 sup. 1A, 5 D, E and F, 7D and E.</p><p><italic>Reviewer #2:</italic></p><p>In this work, Aricthota et al. showed the fission yeast Dbf4 Dependent Kinase (DDK)/Hsk1 phosphorylates histone deacetylase Hst4 upon replication stress, which marks it for degradation by the ubiquitin ligase SCFpof3. The phosphorylation of Hst4 is required for recovery from replication stress, faulty fork restart and decreased viability. The phosphorylation of Hst4 is required for the recruitment of the fork protection complex components to the chromatin in a H3K56ac dependent manner.</p><p>The results that DDK phosphorylates Hst4 for degradation upon replication stress are interesting. However, the overall quality of the data presented is poor. Some data are not consistent and do not support the conclusion quite well. The following are my comments:</p><p>1. The authors used the MMS spot assay to examine the role of Hst4 phosphorylation in MMS sensitivity. However, the data presented are not quite convincing. The function of Hst4 phosphorylation in MMS sensitivity needs more strong evidence. For Figure 4—figure supplement 1B, the 4SA-Hst4 already grew slowly on -Ura. On -Ura+MMS plate, its slow growth cannot be simply attributed to increased sensitivity to MMS. For Figure 4—figure supplement 1B, there is no difference for FL-Hst4 and 4SA-Hst4, which argue against the role of Hst4 phosphorylation in cell function and survival. Also, there is big difference for WT and CΔ-Hst4 grown on -Ura and this difference is not augmented by MMS treatment (Figure 2—figure supplement 1F). These data point to the other function of Hst4, which compromised the main conclusion of this paper.</p><p>2. Some data presented do not support their conclusion:</p><p>For example, in Figure. 2A and B, they claimed that &quot;Hst4 was degraded at 120 minutes in untreated wild type cells, whereas the proteolysis was accelerated upon MMS treatment (Figure. 2A and B).&quot; However, there seems to be an opposite trend for untreated and MMS treatment. Moreover, the quantification data is not consistent with the Western blots.</p><p>Figure 5E: The Co-IP assay showed that Hst4 interacts with Pof3 and this interaction was reduced upon MMS treatment, which contradicts with the role of SCFpof3 in the degradation of Hst4 in response to replication stress.</p><p>3. There is a lot of inconsistency for data in this paper:</p><p>For example, the stability of Hst4 proteins in WT cells when treated with CHX+MMS, Figure 4C and 5C are totally different.</p><p>For Figure 2E, Hst4 was found to be ubiquitinated under normal and MMS treatment. However, in figure 2-supplement 1B, Hst4 is ubiquitinated only upon MMS treatment (Figure 2—figure supplement 1B). Please explain this discrepancy.</p><p>4. Some Co-IP data in this manuscript need to be improved. For example, in Figure 3H, they only performed in vitro co-IP by incubating recombinant purified Hst4 and purified Dfp1. What about their interaction inside cells? Moreover, the authors can examine the interaction between these proteins under different conditions, i.e. untreated and MMS treatment, HU treatment. Also, a reverse Co-IP is also recommended.</p><p>5. The phosphorylation of Hst4 needs more accurate techniques to confirm, i.e. mass spec. It is likely that not all 4 residues were phosphorylated.</p><p>6. The authors should IP Hst4 when cells were individually synchronized at G2 and S phase and then examined the phosphorylation and ubiquitination status of Hst4.</p><p><italic>Reviewer #3:</italic></p><p>The work by Haldar and colleagues describes a dissection of regulation of the histone deacetylase Hst4 by the DNA replication initiation kinase DDK, in the fission yeast model. The key findings are that Hst4 protein abundance is cell cycle regulated by ubiquitin-mediated proteolysis during S phase, triggered by the Dbf4-dependent kinase (DDK). Proteolysis of Hst4 is triggered by phosphorylation on the C-terminus by DDK, which promotes association of Hst4 with the SCF component Pof3, resulting in polyubiquitination. A phenotypic analysis of hst4 phosphorylation site mutants follows, with replication phenotypes evident, along with the expected reduction in H3K56 acetylation (the established target of Hst4). Interestingly, decreased H3K56-Ac, either by the stabilizing 4SA-hst4 mutant, or by H3K56R, correlates with increased abundance of fork protection complex proteins, but with decreased FPC proteins in the chromatin fraction.</p><p>The work presents a previously unrecognized role for DDK in controlling H3K56 acetylation via Hst4 stability. The data provide good support for Hst4 being a relevant target of DDK, and make a case for dynamic regulation of Hst4 being important. The connection between decreased H3K56-Ac and chromatin binding by the fork protection complex is interesting, but how this effect is mediated is at this point unclear. Some of the data are not convincing, particularly those that support the claim for DDK phosphorylation of Hst4 being replication stress activated. An alternative model is that down-regulation of Hst4 is important during S phase, either perturbed or unperturbed, and that the key effect of replication stress is simply to prolong S phase. There is precedent for regulated proteolysis of the related Hst3 in cerevisiae, although this is CDK-triggered and mediated by a different F-box protein (Delgoshaie 2014). Cell cycle regulation of ScHst3 and Hst4 has been described, including destabilization in MMS (Maas 2006), as has regulation of SpHst4 (Haldar 2008). The importance of dynamic regulation of ScHst3/4 was explored previously in (Maas 2006). My sense is that while the core elements of the work (DDK regulation of Hst4 abundance) are solid, the findings are not of broad enough interest or novelty (in that phospho-regulation of protein stability is common) for <italic>eLife</italic>.</p><p>1. Figure 1F: The DNA contents don't seem to line up properly. It appears that at 120 minutes there is a 1C peak where typically there is a 2C and 4C peak. Why in MMS is there what appears to be a delay in cell separation? How is the position of S phase defined? Accompanying the histograms with a septation index analysis would clarify the position of S.</p><p>2. Line 136: Re-word, as it sounds like the proteasome pathway ubiquitinates.</p><p>3. Line 140: What are the specifics of the bioinformatic analysis? I assume that the authors mean to say that there are putative phosphoacceptor residues in the C-term, rather than phosphorylated residues.</p><p>4. Line 149: The truncation mutant has a severe fitness defect. It is not clear from the data in supplement Figure 2F that it is MMS sensitive.</p><p>5. Line 180: S cerevisiae Dfp1 is Dbf4, not Ddc1.</p><p>6. Line 186: I don't see how it follows from the data presented that chromatin retention affords an evolutionary advantage.</p><p>7. Line 206: Again, it is not clear that the mutants confer MMS sensitivity as they have a large fitness defect unperturbed. A more quantitative assay is required here.</p><p>8. Line 219: Same comment.</p><p>9. Figure 5E: There seems to be a negative effect of MMS on the Hst4-Pof3 interaction, where increased Hst4 phosphorylation and increased Pof3 abundance would suggest that a positive effect should be evident.</p><p>10. Figure 6: Since the MMS sensitivity data are not clear, it would be of interest to look at replication phenotypes of the 4SA-hst4 mutant during unperturbed S phase.</p><p>11. Line 266: The flow cytometry data in supplement Figure 6 appear identical between wt and mutant, with very similar S phase kinetics upon release from HU. This doesn't seem consistent with defective fork restart.</p><p>12. Line 288: What is the rationale for examining hst4∆ here? The more relevant allele is 4SA-hst4.</p><p>13. Line 296: Is there statistical support for this statement?</p><p>14. Figure 7D: Is not convincing. The level of H3 in 4SA HU chromatin is decreased, casting some doubt on the lower signal for Swi1. The soluble fraction blots do not have clear bands, and the Mcl1 chromatin blot has too high background.</p><p>15. Line 300: The PCNA control experiment is in MMS rather than HU, and is not quantified, making comparisons difficult.</p><p>16. Table 1: The mating types and ade status of the strains with '?' should be determined.</p><p>17. As a general comment, bar graphs should be replaced with scatter plots showing all the data points, so that the number of replicates and their distribution is evident. Exact p-values should be stated, either in the legend or on the figures.</p><p>[Editors’ note: further revisions were suggested prior to acceptance, as described below.]</p><p>Thank you for submitting your article &quot;DDK/Hsk1 Phosphorylates and Targets Fission Yeast Histone Deacetylase Hst4 for Degradation to Stabilize Stalled DNA Replication Forks&quot; for consideration by <italic>eLife</italic>.

Figure 5D: the authors performed an HU-block and release experiment that is a classical approach to evaluate the ability of cells to recover from transient fork stalling. However, only the septum index is shown (instead of classical FACS analysis) with a poor interpretation of the data. Line 312, the authors claim that septation occurs at the end of S-phase and is an indication of completion of S-phase. This is not exact. In unchallenged cells, the formation of the septum is concomitant to S-phase. After HU treatment, cells are blocked in early S-phase, mono-nucleated and no septum. After release from HU, cells replicate and WT cells complete replication in 30-45 minutes. The occurrence of the septum after HU block is indicative of the second S-phase in WT cells, after cell division, not of the first S-phase. Thus, this paragraph must be rephrased. As it stands, the data indicate that 4SA-hst4 cells are defective at either the first S-phase and/or the first cell division. Claiming that the data indicate, &quot;defective fork restart&quot; (lines 314) is an over interpretation. The data presented on Figure 6E provide better indication of defective fork restart.</p><p>Figure 5E: I have two questions with this experiment. First, we guess the control should have no HA tagged-Pof3, why there is a band with the same M.W. with HA-Pof3 in control sample? Second, as Hst4 is degraded and Pof3 is increased upon exposure to MMS treatment as demonstrated in this manuscript (Figure 5F), why in the input samples, we could not see the changes?</p><p>10.

Overall, the authors provide clear and comprehensive biochemical studies to establish that Hst4 harbor 4 serine residues at its C-terminal part that are phosphorylated by DDK/Hsk1 during normal and challenged DNA replication. This phospho-degron is proposed to channel Hst4 degradation by the Ubiquitin ligase SFC-Pof3. These finding are well complemented by the genetic study of the 4SA-hst4 allele encoding a degradation resistant form of Hst4. The authors establish that the lack of Hst4 degradation leads to cellular sensitivity to replication blocking agents (MMS and HU), catastrophic mitosis upon HU treatment and defective recovery from transient fork stalling. A molecular mechanism is provided to explain those replication defects phenotypes: the lack of Hst4 degradation results in a reduced level of H3K56Ac that impairs the chromatin association of Swi1 and Mcl1, explaining the reason why stalled forks are more prone to collapse in 4SA-hst4 mutated cells. Finally, the authors provide evidences that reduced level of H3K56Ac in human cells leads to the downregulation of the fork protection complex (Tipin, And-1 and timeless). Overall, the data are convincing and provide novel insights to understand how chromatin features contributes to fork stability. Thus, this manuscript clearly brings novelties in the field. However, some parts of the manuscript require better explanations of the data obtained and/or to tone down some statements.</p></body></sub-article><sub-article article-type="reply" id="sa2"><front-stub><article-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.70787.sa2</article-id><title-group><article-title>Author response</article-title></title-group></front-stub><body><p>[Editors’ note: the authors resubmitted a revised version of the paper for consideration.

As suggested by the reviewer 1, we have repeated all these western blots in figures 3E, Sup. 1A, 5D, E and F, 7D and E. The current figures have been prepared with new blots to improve data quality.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Reviewer #2:</p><p>[…] The results that DDK phosphorylates Hst4 for degradation upon replication stress are interesting. However, the overall quality of the data presented is poor. Some data are not consistent and do not support the conclusion quite well. The following are my comments:</p><p>1. The authors used the MMS spot assay to examine the role of Hst4 phosphorylation in MMS sensitivity. However, the data presented are not quite convincing. The function of Hst4 phosphorylation in MMS sensitivity needs more strong evidence. For Figure 4—figure supplement 1B, the 4SA-Hst4 already grew slowly on -Ura. On -Ura+MMS plate, its slow growth cannot be simply attributed to increased sensitivity to MMS. For Figure 4—figure supplement 1B, there is no difference for FL-Hst4 and 4SA-Hst4, which argue against the role of Hst4 phosphorylation in cell function and survival. Also, there is big difference for WT and CΔ-Hst4 grown on -Ura and this difference is not augmented by MMS treatment (Figure 2—figure supplement 1F). These data point to the other function of Hst4, which compromised the main conclusion of this paper.</p></disp-quote><p>We agree with the reviewer that data shown in the Figure 4—figure supplement 1B, the growth difference was not very significant in absence and presence of MMS. To show the MMS sensitivity more convincingly, we have repeated the spot assays and checked cell growth in presence of different MMS concentrations (low MMS 0.005% and 0.015%). We have also added photographs of spot assay taken on different days to show the difference in sensitivity between FL-Hst4 and 4SA-Hst4 (Figure 4—figure supplement 1C). The difference between FL-Hst4 and 4SA-Hst4 is clear at Day 3 as well as day 6. Further, we have performed cell survival assay and studied colony formation in these strains, which is more quantitative method to check the degree of fitness difference upon replication stress (Figure 4 G, H).</p><p>In this study, we have focused on studying the function of Hst4 in replication stress response pathway where stress is caused exogenously by agents like MMS and HU. We would like to mention that replication stress can also be generated endogenously during unperturbed S phase as replication forks are known to stall during normal DNA replication. These endogenously arising stalled forks could decrease fitness of the mutant strain (4SA-Hst4 mutant) even in absence of external stress by MMS as Hst4 is not degraded during endogenous replication stress in these mutant cells. The fact that Hst4 is degraded during S phase as well as upon HU and MMS treatment shows that stalling of forks is the elicitor of degradation.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>2. Some data presented do not support their conclusion:</p><p>For example, in Figure. 2A and B, they claimed that &quot;Hst4 was degraded at 120 minutes in untreated wild type cells, whereas the proteolysis was accelerated upon MMS treatment (Figure. 2A and B).&quot; However, there seems to be an opposite trend for untreated and MMS treatment. Moreover, the quantification data is not consistent with the Western blots.</p></disp-quote><p>To show this result more conclusively, we have performed this experiment again. The new figure 2A and figure suppl1B shows the observed difference in the level of Hst4 at 90 minutes time point between CHX and CHX + MMS where Hst4 is significantly reduced in MMS treatment. We hope, reviewer finds this data more convincing which supports our conclusion.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Figure 5E: The Co-IP assay showed that Hst4 interacts with Pof3 and this interaction was reduced upon MMS treatment, which contradicts with the role of SCFpof3 in the degradation of Hst4 in response to replication stress.</p></disp-quote><p>This could be the result of the time point taken for the experiment. This experiment was done at 2 hr time point post MMS treatment where Hst4 degradation is complete and this could be the reason for decrease in interaction. We have done this experiment at 60 mins time point where we see no such reduction in the interaction between Hst4 and Pof3 (Figure 5D, E). This interaction was studied in proteasome defective mts2-1 strain where Pof3 and Hst4 interact even in absence of MMS due to the S-phase regulation of Hst4. Additionally, now we have added new data showing interaction of Hst4 and Pof3 in MMS treated conditions in wild type strain. We found that Hst4 interacts with Pof3 only upon MMS treatment in wild type cells (Figure 5E).</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>3. There is a lot of inconsistency for data in this paper:</p><p>For example, the stability of Hst4 proteins in WT cells when treated with CHX+MMS, Figure 4C and 5C are totally different.</p></disp-quote><p>The stability of Hst4 is very much dependent upon cell cycle. We try our best to maintain mid log phase, however, we have observed the change in kinetics upon changes in OD between midlog to log phase cells. This could be because, the kinetics are sensitive to alteration in cell density. Quantification of this blot has been presented in Figure 5, suppl 1B.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>For Figure 2E, Hst4 was found to be ubiquitinated under normal and MMS treatment. However, in figure 2-supplement 1B, Hst4 is ubiquitinated only upon MMS treatment (Figure 2—figure supplement 1B). Please explain this discrepancy.</p></disp-quote><p>In figure 2-supplement 1B, the immunoprecipitation was carried out with IgG beads to pulldown TAP-tagged Hst4. The experiment in Figure 2E was His-Ub pull down with Ni-NTA under denaturing condition. The difference in experimental conditions and pull down efficiency has resulted in the difference in the ubiquitinated Hst4 observed. We have removed this data from supplementary because we could not obtain the same result as in Figure 2E.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>4. Some Co-IP data in this manuscript need to be improved. For example, in Figure 3H, they only performed in vitro co-IP by incubating recombinant purified Hst4 and purified Dfp1. What about their interaction inside cells? Moreover, the authors can examine the interaction between these proteins under different conditions, i.e. untreated and MMS treatment, HU treatment. Also, a reverse Co-IP is also recommended.</p></disp-quote><p>The interactions involving DDK are mainly transient in the cell. We have failed to observe interaction between Hst4 and Hsk1 in vivo, however, previous papers have used formaldehyde crosslinking to detect such transient interactions. We have performed formaldehyde crosslinking and confirmed in vivo interaction between Hst4 and Hsk1 (Figure 3H).</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>5. The phosphorylation of Hst4 needs more accurate techniques to confirm, i.e. mass spec. It is likely that not all 4 residues were phosphorylated.</p></disp-quote><p>We have made single site mutations of where only serine at each of these positions is mutated to alanine. We are checking the stability of mutant Hst4 currently and also confirming the phosphorylation status. Due to lockdown, we could not complete these experiments.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>6. The authors should IP Hst4 when cells were individually synchronized at G2 and S phase and then examined the phosphorylation and ubiquitination status of Hst4.</p></disp-quote><p>We have performed immunoprecipitation in S-phase cells to detect phosphorylation of Hst4. These results are added in Figure 3C. In order to detect ubiquitination, the cdc25-22 and mts2-1 temperature sensitive strains needs to be combined to get cell cycle synchronization as well as inhibition of proteasome to detect ubiquitinated proteins. The selection of such a combined strain would be tricky and therefore, this experiment was challenging for us.</p><p>We were not successful in generating this strain for doing this experiment.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Reviewer #3:</p><p>[…] The work presents a previously unrecognized role for DDK in controlling H3K56 acetylation via Hst4 stability. The data provide good support for Hst4 being a relevant target of DDK, and make a case for dynamic regulation of Hst4 being important. The connection between decreased H3K56-Ac and chromatin binding by the fork protection complex is interesting, but how this effect is mediated is at this point unclear. Some of the data are not convincing, particularly those that support the claim for DDK phosphorylation of Hst4 being replication stress activated. An alternative model is that down-regulation of Hst4 is important during S phase, either perturbed or unperturbed, and that the key effect of replication stress is simply to prolong S phase. There is precedent for regulated proteolysis of the related Hst3 in cerevisiae, although this is CDK-triggered and mediated by a different F-box protein (Delgoshaie 2014). Cell cycle regulation of ScHst3 and Hst4 has been described, including destabilization in MMS (Maas 2006), as has regulation of SpHst4 (Haldar 2008). The importance of dynamic regulation of ScHst3/4 was explored previously in (Maas 2006). My sense is that while the core elements of the work (DDK regulation of Hst4 abundance) are solid, the findings are not of broad enough interest or novelty (in that phospho-regulation of protein stability is common) for eLife.</p><p>1. Figure 1F: The DNA contents don't seem to line up properly. It appears that at 120 minutes there is a 1C peak where typically there is a 2C and 4C peak.
