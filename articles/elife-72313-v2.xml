These are derived from naive B cell precursors that enter the extrafollicular response and the germinal centre (GC) reaction (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib41">Nutt et al., 2015</xref>). Germinal centre derived antibody secreting cells may migrate to the bone marrow where they survive as long-lived plasma cells secreting high-affinity antibody.</p><p>The B- to plasma-cell transition requires substantial reprogramming of the transcriptome. This is achieved in part by the actions of transcription factors and epigenetic regulators that act within a layered system to control the timing of differentiation and its coordination with extracellular cues. Dynamic control within this system is further endowed by the integration of signal transduction pathways and post-transcriptional regulators. A central role for post-transcriptional control is mediated by microRNAs such as <italic>Mir148a (</italic><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib47">Porstner et al., 2015</xref>) and <italic>Mir155 (</italic><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">Lu et al., 2014</xref>) which promote and <italic>Mir125b (</italic><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Gururajan et al., 2010</xref>) which suppresses plasma cell differentiation. RNA binding proteins (RBPs) act co- or post-transcriptionally to influence the quality and quantity of expressed genes. However, while estimates of the numbers of RBPs encoded in the mammalian genome vary between one to five thousand, few have been implicated in plasma cell differentiation, survival, and migration. These include, HNRNPLL which promotes differentiation indirectly by suppressing BCL6 expression (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Chang et al., 2015</xref>); the non-canonical poly(A) polymerase FAM46C/TENT5C which acts as a tumour suppressor in myeloma (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Bilska et al., 2020</xref>); and ZFP36L1 which is required for the emigration of plasma cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib49">Saveliev et al., 2021</xref>).</p><p>Motivated by a lack of known roles of RBPs in plasma cell emergence and survival, we developed a CRISPR library targeting mouse RBPs and performed genetic screens for roles in B cell proliferation and survival, and for roles in regulating the accumulation of CD138 + cells in vitro as a surrogate for authentic plasma cells. We identified 103 RBPs that promote and 189 RBPs that inhibit plasma cell abundance and validated some of these using follow up assays with independent single guide RNA (sgRNA) sequences. Using mouse models, we demonstrated that YTHDF2, an N6-methyladenosine (m<sup>6</sup>A) RNA modification binding protein, acting within B cells is necessary for the accumulation of plasma cells in the bone marrow.</p></sec><sec id="s2" sec-type="results|discussion"><title>Results and discussion</title><sec id="s2-1"><title>Genetic screening identifies RBPs regulating CD138+ cell abundance</title><p>We curated a list of 1213 mouse RBPs (excluding ribosomal subunit proteins) compiled from the compendium by Gerstberger et al and presence in at least two RNA interactome capture studies (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Castello et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Baltz et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Beckmann et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Gerstberger et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Kwon et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">He et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">Liepelt et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="supp1">Supplementary file 1A</xref>). A custom sgRNA library targeting these was constructed in a vector backbone expressing puromycin resistance and CD90.1 as selection markers (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1A</xref>). The library encodes 10 sgRNAs per gene, targets 72 positive control genes and contains 500 negative control sgRNAs. It contains 13,350 sgRNAs in total with &gt;98.8% of sgRNAs normally distributed within a 16-fold range (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1B</xref>; <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="supp1">Supplementary file 1B</xref>).</p><p>To screen RBPs that regulate cell expansion (proliferation or survival), primary mouse B cells expressing Cas9 from the <italic>Rosa26</italic> locus were cultured in vitro on fibroblasts expressing CD40ligand and BAFF for 4 days with IL-4 followed by 4 days with IL-21<sup>15</sup>. The representation of sgRNAs at day 4 and day 8 was determined by next generation sequencing (NGS) and compared (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1C</xref>; <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="supp1">Supplementary file 1C</xref>). sgRNAs targeting <italic>Trp53</italic> and <italic>Myc</italic> enriched as expected for inhibiting and supporting cell expansion, respectively (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1D, E</xref>). <italic>Rc3h1</italic>, <italic>Caprin1,</italic> and <italic>Fam46c</italic> were the only RBPs enriched for limiting B cell proliferation or survival (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1D, E</xref>). FAM46C has been implicated in impairing the proliferation and/or survival of B cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">Mroczek et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Bilska et al., 2020</xref>). Further supporting the predictive power of our dataset, we validated the role for <italic>Rc3h1</italic> as limiting proliferation or survival with individual sgRNAs (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1F</xref>).</p><p>On day 8 of the culture, we sorted cells based on the expression of CD138, a marker of differentiated plasma cells that co-express CD267, IRF4, and BLIMP1 (encoded by <italic>Prdm1</italic>) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1G</xref>), and determined the representation of sgRNAs by NGS (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1C</xref>; <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="supp1">Supplementary file 1D</xref>). To identify RBPs that regulate the accumulation of CD138 + cells, but not B cell expansion between days 4 and 8, we considered the intersection between the two screens (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1A</xref>).

ZFP36- and TNRC6-families, as well as CNOT9 and the interacting partners CNOT10 and CNOT11 of the CCR4-NOT complex have roles in limiting the accumulation of CD138 + cells. By contrast, the CCR4-NOT binding partner YTHDF2 has an essential role in promoting the accumulation of plasma cells in the spleen and bone marrow. The mechanisms by which these RBPs limit CD138 + cell accumulation remain to be investigated. Our in vitro data support a role for YTHDF2 in promoting plasma cell accumulation via differentiation or survival, while our in vivo bone marrow data could also be explained by a role for YTHDF2 in plasma cell migration. We also observed a defect in <italic>Ythdf2</italic> deficient plasma cell accumulation in the spleen and identified m6A methylation on transcripts encoding transcriptional repressors and promotors of plasma cell differentiation; together these indicate that YTHDF2 mediated regulation of differentiation or migration are not sufficient to fully explain YTHDF2 support of plasma cell accumulation. One tempting hypothesis is that YTHDF2 promotes plasma cell accumulation by limiting apoptosis induced by ER stress (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Einstein et al., 2021</xref>) specifically within differentiated plasma cells. Furthermore, METTL3 is required for GC formation and YTHDF2 has been previously shown to have a role in supporting the germinal centre reaction (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Grenov et al., 2021</xref>), which may promote plasma cell accumulation.

Bowtie (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Langmead et al., 2009</xref>) was used to map these sequences with zero mismatches to a custom genome comprising the sgRNA sequences, and Seqmonk used to quantify the abundance of each sgRNA (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://www.bioinformatics.babraham.ac.uk/projects/seqmonk/">https://www.bioinformatics.babraham.ac.uk/projects/seqmonk/</ext-link>). Analysis of our genetic screens was performed with the MAGeCK software (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Li et al., 2014</xref>). MAGeCK determined gene-level LFC for the proliferation/survival (day 8 cells v day 4 cells) and plasma cell abundance (CD138 + cells v CD138- cells) screens. The non-targeting negative control sgRNAs were used to build a mean-variance model for null distribution, which in turn was used to calculate significant sgRNA enrichment. Positive and negative enrichments were calculated, then independently used in robust rank aggregation to obtain gene-level scores. This process identified the extent to which each sgRNA enriched out of the distribution of negative control sgRNAs, then ranked genes by the consistency of their sgRNAs to outperform the null hypothesis (that they would not enrich outside the NT-sgRNAs). Gene-level p-values were calculated by randomizing sgRNA to target gene allocation in permutation tests; false discovery was controlled by the Benjamini–Hochberg procedure. Log2 fold changes (LFC) were calculated as the median LFC for all sgRNAs for a targeted gene that enriched in the same direction. Z-scores were calculated as the number of standard deviations from the mean of all negative control LFCs. Our statistical cutoff for gene level enrichment was set at a Z-score of greater than or equal to +/-2, and an FDR adjusted p-value of less than 0.05.</p></sec><sec id="s3-6"><title>Validation of targets from CRISPR/Cas9 knockout screens</title><p>A mixed population of GFP-Cas9 positive and GFP-Cas9 negative B cells, at a ratio of 75:25, were cocultured and transduced with individual sgRNA vectors against genes of interest.

Total RNA was prepared with a kit (Zymo R2050) following the manufacturer’s instructions and sent to Eclipse Bioinnovations who isolated poly(A) RNA, crosslinked an m<sup>6</sup>A antibody, performed immunoprecipitation and NGS.</p><p>Data were analysed by Eclipse Bioinnovations according to their standard m<sup>6</sup>A-eCLIP analysis pipeline (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://eclipsebio.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/06/eclipsebio_data_analysis_review_m6A-eCLIP.pdf">https://eclipsebio.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/06/eclipsebio_data_analysis_review_m6A-eCLIP.pdf</ext-link>). Briefly: The first 10 bases of each read (which comprise a UMI) were trimmed using UMI-tools (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib54">Smith et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Li et al., 2011</xref>), followed by trimming of poor quality and adaptor sequences from the 3' end of the reads using cutadapt. Reads mapping to repetitive elements were filtered out, and the remaining reads mapped to the mouse GRCm38 genome build using STAR. PCR duplicates were removed using UMI-tools. Clusters of reads (peaks of m<sup>6</sup>A modification) were identified using CLIPper (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://github.com/YeoLab/clipper/wiki/CLIPper-Home">https://github.com/YeoLab/clipper/wiki/CLIPper-Home</ext-link>), and log2 fold change relative to the corresponding input sample calculated. Clusters that were reproducible between replicates were then identified using IDR (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Krakau et al., 2017</xref>) (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://github.com/nboley/idr">https://github.com/nboley/idr</ext-link>). Single nucleotide resolution crosslink sites with enrichment relative to input were also identified using PureCLIP (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib48">Ramírez et al., 2016</xref>). The gene or feature type to which each crosslink site was assigned was based on the Ensembl Mouse GRCm38.97 annotation release. If the site overlapped multiple genes or feature types, the most likely was chosen in a hierarchical way: first, protein coding isoforms were prioritised; second, transcript isoforms with support level &lt;4 were prioritised; third by a hierarchy of feature types (CDS &gt;3’UTR &gt;5’UTR &gt;intron &gt; non-coding exon &gt;non-coding intron); third, higher confidence isoforms (based first on transcript support level and second on whether they have a CCDS) were prioritised.</p><p>To assess enrichment of 5 base motifs at the crosslink sites, the 5 bases centred on each crosslink site for each replicate were identified, and the representation of all 5-mers quantified. This was repeated for 100 sets of control sites, where the locations of the crosslink sites were randomised across all genes that contain at least one crosslink site, ensuring the same distribution across features as in the m<sup>6</sup>A-eCLIP dataset. The z-score for each 5mer was then calculated as: (occurrence at eCLIP crosslink sites - mean occurrence at control sites) / standard deviation of occurrence at control sites.</p><p>Metagene analysis of the distribution of m<sup>6</sup>A was performed on the Galaxy server using deepTools (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Kim et al., 2015</xref>). The computeCoverage tool was first used using the Ensembl Mouse GRCm38.97 GTF file, scaling all CDS annotations and additionally analysing 1 kb up- and downstream of each. A BED file containing the reproducible clusters was used as the score file, and the maximum value calculated, without skipping 0 s (therefore, this will be 1 for windows containing a cluster and 0 for those without). The resulting matrix was then used as input to plotProfile, and the average across all genes plotted.</p></sec><sec id="s3-13"><title>Generation and analysis of mRNA sequencing libraries</title><p>For transcriptomic analysis, total RNA was isolated from 0.4 × 10<sup>6</sup> FACS-sorted B220hi CD138- and B220lo CD138 +B cells (derived from 3 biological replicates after eight days in culture) using the RNeasy Mini Kit (Qiagen). cDNA was generated from polyadenylated transcripts employing the SMART-Seq v4 ultra low input RNA kit (Takara Bio). RNA and cDNA quality was analysed on a 2100 Bioanalyser (Agilent). mRNAseq libraries were prepared using Nextera XT DNA library preparation kit (Illumina) and quantified with KAPA library quantification kit (Roche). Barcoded libraries were multiplexed and sequenced on an Illumina HiSeq 2500-RapidRun system on a 50 bp single-end mode with a coverage of 20 M reads per sample. Reads were trimmed using Trim Galore and mapped to mouse genome GRCm38.97 using HiSat2 (2.1.0) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Love et al., 2014</xref>). Raw counts were calculated over mRNA features (excluding Ig molecules) using SeqMonk (1.47.2; <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://www.bioinformatics.babraham.ac.uk/projects/seqmonk/">https://www.bioinformatics.babraham.ac.uk/projects/seqmonk/</ext-link>). DESeq2 (1.30.1)<sup>60</sup> was used to calculate differential RNA abundance and performed using default parameters, with ‘normal’ log2 fold change shrinkage. p Values were adjusted for false discovery rate using the Benjamini-Hochberg method. Information on biological replicates were included in the design formula to have paired analysis. Differentially expressed transcripts were cross-referenced with transcripts that contained peaks of m<sup>6</sup>A modification identified using CLIPper.</p></sec></sec></body><back><sec id="s4" sec-type="additional-information"><title>Additional information</title><fn-group content-type="competing-interest"><title>Competing interests</title><fn fn-type="COI-statement" id="conf1"><p>No competing interests declared</p></fn><fn fn-type="COI-statement" id="conf2"><p>No competing interests declared</p></fn></fn-group><fn-group content-type="author-contribution"><title>Author contributions</title><fn fn-type="con" id="con1"><p>Conceptualization, Data curation, Formal analysis, Investigation, Methodology, Project administration, Visualization, Writing – original draft, Writing – review and editing</p></fn><fn fn-type="con" id="con2"><p>Conceptualization, Investigation, Methodology, Writing – review and editing</p></fn><fn fn-type="con" id="con3"><p>Conceptualization, Formal analysis, Visualization, Writing – review and editing</p></fn><fn fn-type="con" id="con4"><p>Conceptualization, Data curation, Formal analysis, Visualization, Writing – review and editing</p></fn><fn fn-type="con" id="con5"><p>Conceptualization, Methodology, Validation, Writing – review and editing</p></fn><fn fn-type="con" id="con6"><p>Resources</p></fn><fn fn-type="con" id="con7"><p>Resources</p></fn><fn fn-type="con" id="con8"><p>Conceptualization, Funding acquisition, Supervision, Writing – review and editing</p></fn><fn fn-type="con" id="con9"><p>Conceptualization, Funding acquisition, Project administration, Supervision, Writing – review and editing</p></fn></fn-group><fn-group content-type="ethics-information"><title>Ethics</title><fn fn-type="other"><p>All mouse experimentation was approved by the Babraham Institute Animal Welfare and Ethical Review Body and was licensed by the United Kingdom Home Office under PPL P4D4AF812.</p></fn></fn-group></sec><sec id="s5" sec-type="supplementary-material"><title>Additional files</title><supplementary-material id="transrepform"><label>Transparent reporting form</label><media mime-subtype="pdf" mimetype="application" xlink:href="elife-72313-transrepform1-v2.pdf"/></supplementary-material><supplementary-material id="supp1"><label>Supplementary file 1.</label><caption><title>Supplementary tables.</title></caption><media mime-subtype="xlsx" mimetype="application" xlink:href="elife-72313-supp1-v2.xlsx"/></supplementary-material></sec><sec id="s6" sec-type="data-availability"><title>Data availability</title><p>The sgRNA library is available upon request and from Addgene (#169082).

We also include an acceptance summary that explains what the editors found interesting or important about the work.</p></boxed-text><p><bold>Decision letter after peer review:</bold></p><p>Thank you for submitting your article &quot;The RNA m6A binding protein YTHDF2 promotes the B cell to plasma cell transition.&quot; for consideration by <italic>eLife</italic>. Your article has been reviewed by 3 peer reviewers, and the evaluation has been overseen by a Reviewing Editor and Satyajit Rath as the Senior Editor. The following individual involved in review of your submission has agreed to reveal their identity: Koji Tokoyoda (Reviewer #1).</p><p>The reviewers have discussed their reviews with one another, and the Reviewing Editor has drafted this to help you prepare a revised submission.</p><p>Essential revisions:</p><p>1. The discrepancy of Figure 2C and 3D is confusing. Does YTHDR2 affect the formation of germinal centre B cells? If the authors just claim that GC can be formed, to support the cytometric data, histological analyses should be performed.</p><p>2. Was the detection of NIP/IgG1 in CD138+ plasma cells performed by intracellular staining? Since most NP-specific IgG1-secreting plasma cells lose surface Igs, the detection may be underestimated. Alternatively, an ELISPOT assay can be also utilized.</p><p>3. The identification of YTHDF2-related genes in B/plasma cells should be further assessed. The protein expression of CXCR4, S1PR, integrin alpha4, etc. by flow cytometry will be supportive to Figure 4, even if it makes no difference.</p><p>4. Data presented in Figure 1C, 1F, 1G, Figure 2 and Figure 3 should be confirmed in at least 2 independent experiments performed on independent days with appropriate group sizes. The data presented here appears to be from one experimental cohort.</p><p>5. For the YTHDF2 knockout experiments did the authors also measure antibody titers to the high valency NP molecules? The data showing a small but significant drop in antibody titers to low-valency NP and if high-valency titers are normal this would suggests affinity maturation maybe affected in the absence of YTHDF2. This experiment would add support to the authors conclusion that the germinal center is not affected in the absence of YTHDF2. Additionally, ELISpot assays should be used as an additional method for enumerating NP-specific plasma cells in the spleens and bone marrow since the numbers that are counted by flow cytometry are so rare.</p><p>6.The statistical cutoffs and other metrics (i.e., z-score or fold change) used to define sgRNA enrichment should be clearly stated in the methods section, manuscript text, and/or figure legends.</p><p>7. Details and steps for how the CRISPR/Cas9 screen, RNA-seq analysis, and eCLIP data was processed were included in the reporting summary but should also be included in the appropriate section of the manuscript.</p><p>8. CD138 expression alone is not necessarily sufficient to identify plasma cells. To determine the relationship between CD138+ cells induced in their in vitro system and in vivo plasma cells, the authors should perform a principal component analysis comparing the gene expression profile obtained from their RNA-seq analysis of CD138+B220lo cells with publicly available gene expression data from plasma cells. The authors could also show the percentage of CD138+B220lo cells that express key markers of plasma cell differentiation such as Blimp1.</p><p>9. The authors used mixed bone marrow chimera approaches to determine that YTHDF2 acts in a B cell intrinsic manner. However, these results do not indicate the stage of B cell differentiation where YTHDF2 acts to regulate plasma cell differentiation. Crossing the Ythdf2f/f mice to mice expressing Cre recombinase specifically in germinal center or plasma cells, such as the Jchain Cre, could clarify this issue. Alternatively, the authors could generate chimeras where they transduce Ythdf2f/f bone marrow with a tamoxifen inducible Cre to allow them to specifically ablate Ythdf2 after B cell activation has already occurred.</p><p>10. It is also unclear whether YTHDF2 is regulating migration to the bone marrow or maintenance within the bone marrow. A kinetic assessment of the frequency of bone marrow plasma cells in cKO mice could clarify this question.</p><p>11. The authors should include the number of times each experiment was repeated, and the total number of mice used in the figure legend. Based on the reporting form it seems that some experiments were only done once with 3-4 mice in the control group. Key experiments should be repeated at least twice with 3-6 mice per group to verify the reproducibility of their results.</p><p><italic>Reviewer #1 (Recommendations for the authors):</italic></p><p>The authors show an important role of an RNA-binding protein (RBP), YTHDF2 in the accumulation of plasma cells.

At this time, when the GC reaction is waning no conclusions can be drawn about the formation or function of germinal centres. Thus we have removed these data from the revised submission.</p><p>The paper by Grenov et al., is now published, in Figure 5C of that paper it shows a two-fold reduction in the frequency of GC B cells 14 days after administration of NP-KLH. In addition, it shows YTHDF2 is not required for the <italic>Myc</italic>-dependent gene expression programme associated with the selection of high-affinity B cell clones. These published data are consistent with our finding that YTHDF2 has no detectable effect on the GC cell numbers at day 7 in competitive chimeras, and a very small effect on the GC cellularity at day 21 in mMT chimeras. We include new data (Figure 2B) which shows no major effect on affinity maturation of the antibody response at day 21 in mMT chimeras.</p><p>The data of Grenov et al., and our findings, using independent systems and measurements suggest that any defect in the GC that does exist must be rather small in magnitude. The suggested histological analysis would require generating a new set of radiation chimeras in mMT mice, which we are unable to do. Histology may distinguish if the number or size of GCs is affected by the absence of YTHDF2, but we have no reason to think this is likely to be the case. Histology, in our experience, is not more sensitive than flow cytometry at detecting small differences in GC size.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>2.

In each experiment, data points are individual mice which are considered biological replicates. We have only conducted the measurements made in Figure 3 (competitive chimeras) in a single experiment with the indicated number of biological replicates. We have revised the text to clarify that the µMT and competitive chimera experiments are two independent experimental approaches to address the role of YTHDF2 in plasma cell differentiation [page 8, line 21]. Given that the competitive chimeras were generated as confirmatory support of the observations made with two independent cohorts of µMT chimeras and that the results from both systems are consistent with each other further repetition will not change the conclusion that YTHDF2 is required for accumulation of bone marrow plasma cells. We have clarified this in the transparent reporting file.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>For the YTHDF2 knockout experiments did the authors also measure antibody titers to the high valency NP molecules?

We have added new data to Figure 2B to show the ratio of high and low valency NP-binding IgG1 and conclude that the affinity maturation of the antibody response is not obviously diminished by the absence of YTHDF2 in B cells (we elaborate on this conclusion in response to reviewer 1 comment 1). Lack of correlation between antibody secreting cell numbers and serum antibody titers has been previously reported Takahashi et al., 1998; Holl et al., 2011, and has been previously observed in our group (Saveliev et al., Ref 7). Unfortunately, we do not have ELISPOT data, but our flow cytometry assays for detecting NP-binding cells as CD138+ CD267+ IRF4+ are robust and quantitative.</p><p>https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC2212188/</p><p>https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC3771081/</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>The statistical cutoffs and other metrics (i.e., z-score or fold change) used to define sgRNA enrichment should be clearly stated in the methods section, manuscript text, and/or figure legends.</p></disp-quote><p>We did not use a statistical cutoff for the enrichment of individual sgRNAs, instead we used a statistical cutoff for the combined enrichment of all sgRNAs targeting individual genes.

We have clarified this in the revised version of the manuscript [page 15, line 16].</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Details and steps for how the CRISPR/Cas9 screen, RNA-seq analysis, and eCLIP data was processed were included in the reporting summary but should also be included in the appropriate section of the manuscript.</p></disp-quote><p>We have revised the manuscript to include the relevant information from the reporting summary [page15].</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Multiple typos were found throughout the manuscript that should be corrected.</p></disp-quote><p>We have carefully proofread our manuscript prior to resubmission and apologise for any typographical errors.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Reviewer #3 (Recommendations for the authors):</p><p>1) CD138 expression alone is not necessarily sufficient to identify plasma cells. To determine the relationship between CD138+ cells induced in their in vitro system and in vivo plasma cells, the authors should perform a principal component analysis comparing the gene expression profile obtained from their RNA-seq analysis of CD138+B220lo cells with publicly available gene expression data from plasma cells. The authors could also show the percentage of CD138+B220lo cells that express key markers of plasma cell differentiation such as Blimp1.</p></disp-quote><p>In our experience, the technical differences between RNA-seq libraries prepared at different times and in different labs contribute a substantial amount of variability to the data, making direct comparisons very difficult. Thus, we believe a principle component analysis integrating our data with published plasma cell gene expression data would likely be very difficult to interpret. We include new data (Figure 1—figure supplement 1G) that shows the CD138+B220lo cells present in our cultures are also CD267+, IRF4+ and PRDM1+. These additional markers underpin our belief that the CD138+ B220lo cells have essential features of plasma cells. Moreover, the control genes in the screen <italic>Bach2</italic>, <italic>Prdm1</italic> and <italic>Irf4</italic> also enrich in a manner consistent with their expected impact on the differentiation of plasma cells, further substantiating the utility of the in vitro differentiation system for such a screen.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>2) The authors used mixed bone marrow chimera approaches to determine that YTHDF2 acts in a B cell intrinsic manner. However, these results do not indicate the stage of B cell differentiation where YTHDF2 acts to regulate plasma cell differentiation. Crossing the Ythdf2f/f mice to mice expressing Cre recombinase specifically in germinal center or plasma cells, such as the Jchain Cre, could clarify this issue. Alternatively, the authors could generate chimeras where they transduce Ythdf2f/f bone marrow with a tamoxifen inducible Cre to allow them to specifically ablate Ythdf2 after B cell activation has already occurred.</p></disp-quote><p>We have demonstrated that <italic>Ythdf2</italic> deficiency does not impact the reconstitution of the mature B cell compartment. We have more clearly stated the limitations of our current work [page 10, line 17 and page 11 line 1] to acknowledge the uncertainty around the precise stage, or stages that <italic>Ythdf2</italic> acts in plasma cell differentiation and survival. We have revised the title of our manuscript to reflect this important point raised by the reviewer. A detailed mechanistic study using additional Cre mouse models is not possible to perform as we have not generated these mice. It would take us an additional 2 years to complete this revision and we believe this would be beyond the scope of this brief report.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>3) It is also unclear whether YTHDF2 is regulating migration to the bone marrow or maintenance within the bone marrow. A kinetic assessment of the frequency of bone marrow plasma cells in cKO mice could clarify this question.</p></disp-quote><p>We agree that our data do not address the possibility that YTHDF2 has a role in the migration or survival of plasma cells and have edited the manuscript to ensure that this limitation is clear [page 10, line 17]. Given that both of our chimeric models indicate a reduction in the accumulation of antibody-secreting cells in the spleen at day 21 after immunisation we believe it is reasonable to suggest that YTHDF2 does not solely impact the accumulation of plasma cells through a role in migration. In light of Einstein et al., 2021, which describes a role for YTHDF2 in limiting endoplasmic reticulum stress-induced apoptosis https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/34216543/, it is appealing to hypothesise that YTHDF2 also limits apoptosis due to ER stress in plasma cells. We have discussed this possibility in the revised version of the manuscript [page 10, line 24].</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>4) The authors should include the number of times each experiment was repeated, and the total number of mice used in the figure legend. Based on the reporting form it seems that some experiments were only done once with 3-4 mice in the control group. Key experiments should be repeated at least twice with 3-6 mice per group to verify the reproducibility of their results.</p></disp-quote><p>We apologise for omitting this information and causing ambiguity. We have updated the manuscript to include this [page 8 line 9, page 8 line 24 and figure legends]. Our competitive chimera experiment consisted of only 3 control mice and was conducted once. However, as this experiment was primarily undertaken to support the findings made with multiple cohorts of µMT chimeras and gave a consistent result we do not believe repeating it will add significant value to the manuscript. Therefore, we have taken care to indicate these limitations [page 8 line 24].</p><p>Furthermore, we include new data that shows a comparison between the absolute number of antigen specific antibody secreting cells that arise from WT CD45.1+ internal controls and <italic>Ythdf2</italic> deficient CD45.2+ cells in our competitive chimeras in N=6 mice (Figure 3—figure supplement 1C). These data enable the clear interpretation that YTHDF2-deficient plasma cells show defective accumulation in the bone marrow.</p></body></sub-article></article>
