During sprouting angiogenesis, endothelial tip cells invade avascular tissues by generating actomyosin-dependent forces that drive cell migration and vascular expansion. Surprisingly, endothelial cells (ECs) can still invade if actin polymerization is inhibited. In this study, we show that endothelial tip cells employ an alternative mechanism of cell migration that is dependent on Aquaporin (Aqp)-mediated water inflow and increase in hydrostatic pressure. In the zebrafish, ECs express <italic>aqp1a.1</italic> and <italic>aqp8a.1</italic> in newly formed vascular sprouts in a VEGFR2-dependent manner. Aqp1a.1 and Aqp8a.1 loss-of-function studies show an impairment in intersegmental vessels formation because of a decreased capacity of tip cells to increase their cytoplasmic volume and generate membrane protrusions, leading to delayed tip cell emergence from the dorsal aorta and slower migration. Further inhibition of actin polymerization resulted in a greater decrease in sprouting angiogenesis, indicating that ECs employ two mechanisms for robust cell migration in vivo. Our study thus highlights an important role of hydrostatic pressure in tissue morphogenesis.</p></abstract><kwd-group kwd-group-type="author-keywords"><kwd>cell

sec-type="intro"><title>Introduction</title><p>The blood vascular system is a dynamic, multicellular tissue that adapts to the metabolic demands of development, growth, and homeostasis by altering its pattern and morphology. Macroscopic transformation in the vascular network is achieved by microscopic changes in endothelial cell (EC) behaviors. For example, vascular expansion through sprouting angiogenesis requires the coordination of EC migration, proliferation, anastomosis, lumen formation, and cell rearrangements, all of which require specific cell shape changes. At the initial phase of sprouting angiogenesis, endothelial tip cells generate numerous membrane protrusions such as filopodia and lamellipodia that drive migration and anastomosis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Figueiredo et al., 2021</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Gerhardt et al., 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib59">Phng et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib65">Sauteur et al., 2017</xref>). During tubulogenesis, apical membranes deform by generating inverse blebs to expand lumens so that blood can be transported efficiently through the blood vascular network (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Gebala et al., 2016</xref>). However, following vessel perfusion, ECs become less dynamic and instead develop mechanoresistance to the deforming forces of blood pressure to maintain vessel morphology (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">Kondrychyn et al., 2020</xref>). EC shape is therefore dynamic and changes depending on the morphogenetic state of vascular development.</p><p>It is well established that localized remodeling of actin cytoskeleton and non-myosin II contractility are instrumental in driving cell shape changes during tissue morphogenesis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Clarke and Martin, 2021</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib52">Munjal and Lecuit, 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib53">Murrell et al., 2015</xref>). More recently, there is an accumulating body of work implicating a role of water flow and the resulting increase in hydrostatic pressure as another mechanical mechanism of cell shape change (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Choudhury et al., 2022</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Chugh et al., 2022</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib42">Li et al., 2020</xref>). For example, in the osmotic engine model of cell migration, polarized distribution of ion channels and transporters generates an osmotic gradient that drives water inflow at the leading edge and outflow at the rear, leading to forward translocation of tumor cells in confined microenvironment (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib69">Stroka et al., 2014</xref>). Additionally, hydrostatic pressure from the extracellular environment can drive tissue morphogenesis, as demonstrated during mouse blastocyst formation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Chan et al., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Dumortier et al., 2019</xref>), development of the otic vesicle in the zebrafish (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib51">Mosaliganti et al., 2019</xref>), and blood vessel lumen expansion (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Gebala et al., 2016</xref>). Hydrostatic pressure can therefore generate sufficient forces to shape tissues and organs to their proper form and size during development.</p><p>We have previously discovered that EC migration persists after the inhibition of actin polymerization and in the absence of filopodia to generate new blood vessels in the zebrafish (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib59">Phng et al., 2013</xref>). This observation suggests the existence of an alternative mechanism of migration independent of actin polymerization. In this study, we sought to determine whether hydrostatic pressure regulates EC migration during sprouting angiogenesis in the zebrafish by investigating the function of Aquaporins (Aqp), which are transmembrane water channels that increase water permeability of cell membranes to promote transcellular water flow (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Day et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Farinas et al., 1997</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib40">Kozono et al., 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib61">Preston et al., 1992</xref>). We discovered that ECs of newly formed intersegmental vessels (ISVs) express <italic>aqp1a.1</italic> and <italic>aqp8a.1</italic> mRNA, and observed the enrichment of Aqp1a.1 and Aqp8a.1 proteins in the leading edge of migrating tip cells. Detailed single-cell analyses showed that endothelial tip cells lacking <italic>aqp1a.1</italic> and <italic>aqp8a.1</italic> expression have reduced cell volume, membrane protrusions, and migration capacity. As a result, there is defective sprouting angiogenesis and ISV formation in <italic>aqp1a.1;aqp8a.1</italic> double mutant zebrafish. Notably, when actin polymerization is inhibited in <italic>aqp1a.1;aqp8a.1</italic> double mutant zebrafish, there is a greater impairment in EC migration and sprouting angiogenesis, demonstrating the additive function of actin polymerization and hydrostatic pressure (that is created by water inflow) in generating membrane protrusions to drive EC migration in vivo.</p></sec><sec id="s2" sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><sec id="s2-1"><title><italic>aqp1a.1</italic> and <italic>aqp8a.1</italic> are differentially expressed by tip and stalk cells during sprouting angiogenesis</title><p>Of the 18 <italic>aquaporin</italic> genes that are expressed in zebrafish (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib72">Tingaud-Sequeira et al., 2010</xref>), <italic>aqp1a.1</italic> and <italic>aqp8a.1</italic> mRNA have been detected in blood ECs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">Koun et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib63">Rehn et al., 2011</xref>). We confirmed the endothelial expression of <italic>aqp1a.1</italic> and <italic>aqp8a.1</italic> at 30 hr post fertilization (hpf) and 2, 3, and 4 days post fertilization (dpf) by whole-mount in situ hybridization (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1âfigure supplement 1</xref>). The two endothelial <italic>aqp</italic> genes, however, differ in spatial expression. While <italic>aqp1a.1</italic> is widely expressed in blood vessels of the head and trunk (dorsal aorta [DA], caudal artery [CA], ISVs, dorsal longitudinal anastomotic vessels [DLAV] and caudal vein plexus) at 30 hpf, <italic>aqp8a.1</italic> expression is absent in cerebral blood vessels and is restricted to the DA, CA, and the ventral regions of ISVs in the trunk. After 1 dpf, <italic>aqp8a.1</italic> expression expands to the entire ISV and DLAV. Additionally, the expression of <italic>aqp1a.1</italic> and <italic>aqp8a.1</italic> gradually decreases in the DA and CA so that both are absent by 4 dpf. Single-cell RNA sequencing (scRNAseq) of ECs isolated at 24 hpf, 34 hpf, and 3 dpf further confirmed the endothelial expression of <italic>aqp1a.1</italic> and <italic>aqp8a.1</italic> mRNA (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s2">Figure 1âfigure supplement 2AâF</xref>), revealed differential expression of <italic>aqp1a.1</italic> and <italic>aqp8a.1</italic> mRNA in distinct endothelial clusters, and highlighted elevated <italic>aqp1a.1</italic> transcript expression in all endothelial subtypes compared to <italic>aqp8a.1</italic> (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s2">Figure 1âfigure supplement 2EâH</xref>).</p><p>We next examined the expression pattern of <italic>aqp1a.1</italic> and <italic>aqp8a.1</italic> at the beginning of sprouting angiogenesis at higher resolution using RNAscope and confocal microscopy. At 20 hpf, <italic>aqp1a.1</italic> mRNA is highly expressed in the DA with little expression in the posterior cardinal vein (PCV) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1A and C</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s3">Figure 1âfigure supplement 3</xref>). Closer inspection uncovered heterogeneous expression in the DA, with higher expression in ECs that would be specified as tip cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s3">Figure 1âfigure supplement 3</xref>). Indeed, tip cells of newly formed vascular sprouts express higher levels of <italic>aqp1a.1</italic> compared to adjacent ECs in the DA at 20 hpf (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1AâC</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s3">Figure 1âfigure supplement 3B</xref>) and the majority of ISVs (61%) display higher <italic>aqp1a.1</italic> expression in tip cells than in trailing stalk cells at 22 hpf (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1G</xref>). <italic>Aqp8a.1</italic> expression is at first largely absent in the DA at 20 hpf (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1B and D</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s3">Figure 1âfigure supplement 3C</xref>) but becomes detectable at 22 hpf (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1E and F</xref>).

However, the number of completely formed ISVs is significantly decreased, with the loss of Aqp1a.1 having a more severe impact compared to the loss of Aqp8a.1, and the combined loss of Aqp1a.1 or Aqp8a.1 having a greater deleterious effect.</p></sec><sec id="s2-5"><title>Aquaporins promote endothelial tip cell protrusion and migration</title><p>To gain a better understanding of why ISVs do not develop normally, we assessed EC number.

In <italic>aqp1a.1<sup>+/rk28</sup>;aqp8a.1<sup>+/rk29</sup></italic> embryos, tip cells emerge from the DA between 20 hpf and 24 hpf (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4A</xref>) and migrate dorsally between the somite boundaries over the notochord and neural tube to form primary ISVs (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4B</xref>, <xref ref-type="video" rid="fig4video1">Figure 4âvideo 1</xref>).

By performing detailed expression analyses, we showed that <italic>aqp1a.1</italic> and <italic>aqp8a.1</italic> are differentially expressed in newly formed vascular sprouts. <italic>Aqp1a.1</italic> is expressed earlier in the DA than <italic>aqp8a.1</italic> during development and in ECs destined to be tip cells.

In zebrafish harboring mutations in both <italic>aqp1a.1</italic> and <italic>aqp8a.1</italic>, there is delayed tip cell protrusion from the DA, decreased tip cell migration, and increased occurrence of truncated ISVs at 3 dpf. We further discovered that <italic>aqp1a.1</italic> and <italic>aqp8a.1</italic> expression is upregulated by VEGFR2 activity, suggesting that VEGFA-VEGFR2 signaling employs Aquaporin function as one mechanism to drive sprouting angiogenesis.</p><p>Several lines of evidence implicate Aquaporins in facilitating water flow into endothelial tip cells during sprouting angiogenesis. First, time-lapse imaging showed polarized localization of Aqp1a.1 and Aqp8a.1 proteins at the leading edge of migrating tip cells, suggesting that water flow occurs locally at the migrating front of the cell. Secondly, single-cell analyses revealed Aqp1a.1- and Aqp8a.1-deficient tip cells have reduced cell volume, impaired expansion of cell membranes at the leading edge, and decreased generation of stable cell protrusions. These observations implicate water flow into tip cells, leading to increased cell volume. This is confirmed by the overexpression of Aqp1a.1 in tip cells that resulted in increased cell volume. Due to the incompressible property of water within an enclosed compartment such as the cell, water influx will lead to elevation in hydrostatic pressure. At the leading edge of tip cells, increased hydrostatic pressure would expand and deform membranes to generate protrusions. Additionally, water influx can reduce cytoplasmic viscosity and increase spacing between the plasma membrane and the underlying actin cytoskeleton, promoting actin monomer diffusion, actin polymerization, and the generation of membrane protrusions to facilitate cell migration (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">de Boer et al., 2023</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib45">Loitto et al., 2009</xref>).</p><p>A key finding in this study is the demonstration that endothelial tip cells employ hydrostatic pressure as a second mechanism of cell migration in vivo. In a previous study, we discovered that ECs continue to migrate when actin polymerization is inhibited and in the absence of filopodia (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib59">Phng et al., 2013</xref>). Here, we show that hydrostatic pressure can generate force for EC migration in the absence of actin-based force generation. When both mechanisms are perturbed, there is a greater impairment in EC migration (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7D and E</xref>). This finding highlights the importance of hydrostatic pressure as an additional mechanism that reinforces actin-based cell shape changes and motility to ensure robust migration and formation of new blood vessels in complex three-dimensional environments. Such dual mode migration is advantageous when blood vessels develop in physically confined spaces such as in the zebrafish trunk, where ECs must emerge from the DA and migrate between somite boundaries and over tissues such as the notochord and neural tube to form ISVs. Such dependence on water flow in cell migration under confined microenvironment has been reported in human MDA-MB-231 breast cancer cells and mouse S180 sarcoma cells, which show cell migration persistence in narrow channels after inhibition of actin polymerization or myosin II-mediated contractility (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib69">Stroka et al., 2014</xref>). In this context, AQP5 mediates water flow and the decrease or increase in AQP5 expression suppresses or enhances, respectively, cancer cell migration (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Chae et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Jung et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib69">Stroka et al., 2014</xref>).</p><p>Our findings on the endothelial function of zebrafish Aqp1a.1, which is homologous to mammalian AQP1, corroborate previous studies demonstrating a function of AQP1 in promoting cell migration. In tumor-bearing AQP1-null mice, there is reduced tumor angiogenesis and AQP1-deficient ECs display reduced migration in an in vitro wound-healing assay (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib47">Maltaneri et al., 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib64">Saadoun et al., 2005</xref>). In chick, AQP1 expression levels affect neural crest cell migration speed and direction by regulating filopodia length and stability (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib49">McLennan et al., 2020</xref>). The regulation of membrane protrusions has also been demonstrated for other Aquaporin proteins. For example, AQP9 weakens membrane-cytoskeleton anchorage and promote the formation of membrane protrusions such as filopodia and blebs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">Karlsson et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib44">Loitto et al., 2007</xref>). We also demonstrate for the first time a role of Aqp8a.1 in promoting EC migration and sprouting angiogenesis in the zebrafish. However, its mammalian ortholog, AQP8, was shown to inhibit colorectal cancer cell lines in vitro (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib76">Wu et al., 2017</xref>), suggesting cell- and context-dependent function of AQP8 in the regulation of cell migration. The role of Aqp1a.1 and Aqp8a.1 has also been recently investigated in the zebrafish. However, the authors did not report defects in EC migration but instead observed altered ISV diameter in Aqp1a.1 and Aqp8a.1 knockout and overexpression experiments (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Chen et al., 2024</xref>). While we corroborate a decrease in the diameter of aISVs and vISVs in <italic>aqp1a.1<sup>rk28/rk28</sup></italic> and <italic>aqp1a.1<sup>rk28/rk28</sup>;aqp8a.1<sup>rk29/rk29</sup></italic> zebrafish, we observed a slight increase in the diameter in <italic>aqp8a.1<sup>rk29/rk29</sup></italic> zebrafish at 2 dpf (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s7">Figure 3âfigure supplement 7A</xref>). Furthermore, unlike described in Chen et al., we could not detect a difference in ISV diameter between control and Aqp1a.1- or Aqp8a.1-overexpressing ECs (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s7">Figure 3âfigure supplement 7B</xref>). The disparity in phenotypes observed between our groups is likely a result of differences in the <italic>aqp1a.1</italic> and <italic>aqp8a.1</italic> mutations and the level of Aqp1a.1 or Aqp8a. overexpression generated in our respective zebrafish lines.</p><p>A central determinant of water movement is the osmotic gradient across the membrane, with water flowing in the direction of higher osmotic concentration to build up hydrostatic pressure. Given a crucial role of water flow in regulating cell volume, shape, and migration, it is also important to understand the function and distribution of ion channels, exchangers, and transporters and water channels that generate an osmotic gradient across the cell. This is reflected in a growing number of studies demonstrating a role of ion transporters in cell migration. In neutrophils, the increase in cell volume and potentiation of cell migration depend on the sodium-proton exchanger 1 (NHE1) and the chloride-bicarbonate exchanger 2 (AE2) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib54">Nagy et al., 2023</xref>). In T cells, chemokine-induced migration depends on ion influx via SLC12A1, and water influx via AQP3 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">de Boer et al., 2023</xref>). In tumor cells migrating in narrow channels, the establishment of a polarized distribution of Na<sup>+</sup>/H<sup>+</sup> pumps and Aquaporin proteins in cell membranes is required for net inflow of ions and water at the leading edge and net outflow at the trailing edge (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib69">Stroka et al., 2014</xref>). Although our study identifies a function of Aqp1a.1 and Aqp8a.1 in facilitating water inflow, it remains unknown which ion channels and transporters control ion flux across the cell membrane to modulate water flow in tip cells. Results from our study suggest a role of SWELL1 in generating an osmotic gradient that controls EC migration since its inhibition resulted in reduced membrane protrusions, slower tip cell migration, and defective sprouting angiogenesis. Due to the limitations of our experimental approach, we do not know whether the effect of inhibiting SWELL1 function is cell autonomous or a consequence of altered chloride flux in the neighboring cells that would alter tissue osmolarity. It also remains to be clarified where SWELL1 is localized within migrating ECs, how it regulates the osmotic gradient within the EC (cellular) and between the EC and the surrounding interstitial tissue (extracellular) to control the direction of water flow, and whether other ion channels also work in concert to modulate overall cellular and extracellular osmolarity to direct EC migration.</p><p>We have also observed enrichment of Aqp1a.1 and Aqp8a.1 proteins in specific compartments of ECs at the leading edge of migrating endothelial tip cells as well as apical membranes during lumen formation (not shown). This leads to the question of how Aquaporin localization is regulated as this will determine the site of increased water inflow and hydrostatic pressure. It has been shown that rapid changes in subcellular localization of mammalian Aquaporins upon stimulation occurs mainly via trafficking to and from the plasma membrane (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib48">Markou et al., 2022</xref>) to modulate the amount of protein in the plasma membrane. The regulation of AQP subcellular relocalization via calmodulin- and/or phosphorylation-dependent mechanisms has been implicated for AQP0-5 and AQP7-9 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib48">Markou et al., 2022</xref>). For example, rapid translocation of AQP1 to plasma membrane upon a hypotonic stimulus is dependent on calmodulin activation and phosphorylation by protein kinases C (PKC) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Conner et al., 2012</xref>) and subcellular localization of AQP8 in hepatocytes is also regulated by PKA and PI3K signaling (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Gradilone et al., 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Gradilone et al., 2003</xref>). Further work is needed to elucidate the mechanism of Aqp1a.1 and Aqp8a.1 protein distribution in ECs.</p><p>In this study, we have assumed that Aqp1a.1 and Aqp8a.1 regulate EC behaviors through their ability to control water permeation based on previous studies demonstrating that water molecules flow through mammalian AQP1 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib61">Preston et al., 1992</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib77">Zeidel et al., 1992</xref>) and AQP8 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib43">Liu et al., 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib46">Ma et al., 1997</xref>), as well as through zebrafish orthologs Aqp1a.1 and Aqp8a.1 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib72">Tingaud-Sequeira et al., 2010</xref>). However, AQP1 and AQP8 are not water-specific channels. AQP1 can conduct unpolar gases such as carbon dioxide (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib55">Nakhoul et al., 1998</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib60">Prasad et al., 1998</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib75">Wang et al., 2007</xref>) and nitric oxide (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Herrera et al., 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Herrera and Garvin, 2007</xref>), and in zebrafish, Aqp1a.1 also mediates the transfer for small gaseous molecules such as carbon dioxide and ammonia (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib70">Talbot et al., 2015</xref>). AQP8 is permeable to ammonia (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">Jahn et al., 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib43">Liu et al., 2006</xref>) and is present in the inner mitochondrial membrane (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Calamita et al., 2005</xref>), where it is suggested to mediate ammonia transport rather than water fluxes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib68">Soria et al., 2010</xref>). Nevertheless, because water movement flows up an osmotic gradient, increased entry of ions into the cell through Aquaporins will also trigger water inflow.</p><p>In summary, our study highlights the role of water influx and hydrostatic pressure as another force-generating mechanism utilized by cells to build tissues during animal development. We demonstrate that endothelial tip cells employ both actin polymerization and hydrostatic pressure for robust sprouting angiogenesis. As morphogenetic events are governed by a coordination of cell shape changes, cell migration, and rearrangements, we envision that the shaping and formation of other tissues will also depend on Aquaporin function and changes in hydrostatic pressure.</p></sec><sec id="s4" sec-type="materials|methods"><title>Materials and methods</title><table-wrap id="keyresource" position="anchor"><label>Key

The top 2000 variable genes identified using the vst method in FindVariableFeatures function were used for principal component analysis in RunPCA function, and the first 30 principal components were used for visualization analysis with Uniform Manifold Approximation and Projection (UMAP) method, and in FindNeighbors function analysis. The cell clustering resolution was set at 0.5 in FindClusters function. The Seurat object was then processed using the ShinyCell package (version 2.1) for gene expression visualizations.</p></sec><sec id="s4-21"><title>Statistical analysis</title><p>For zebrafish experiments, the sample size (number of cells or vessels) was chosen based on the number of embryos expressing the transgene of interest (e.g., transient overexpression of plasmids) or of the desired genotype obtained per experiment. The number of embryos used for time-lapse imaging per experiment ranged from 3 to 4 per experiment for overnight imaging, 6â8 for short (0.5â2 hr) but high temporal resolution imaging, and 1â3 embryos for drug treatments since time was a limiting factor. Statistical analysis was performed using Prism software version 10.2.0 (GraphPad). The variance between the mean values of two groups was evaluated using the unpaired Studentâs <italic>t</italic>-test. For assessment of more than three groups, we used one-way ANOVA test. A p-value of &lt;0.05 was considered statistically significant. Statistic details can be found in each figure legend.</p></sec><sec id="s4-22"><title>Materials availability statement</title><p>Further information and requests for reagents should be directed to the corresponding author, Li-Kun Phng (likun.phng@riken.jp).</p></sec></sec></body><back><sec sec-type="additional-information" id="s5"><title>Additional information</title><fn-group content-type="competing-interest"><title>Competing interests</title><fn fn-type="COI-statement" id="conf1"><p>No competing interests declared</p></fn></fn-group><fn-group content-type="author-contribution"><title>Author contributions</title><fn fn-type="con" id="con1"><p>Data curation, Formal analysis, Investigation, Methodology, Writing â original draft</p></fn><fn fn-type="con" id="con2"><p>Formal analysis, Methodology</p></fn><fn fn-type="con" id="con3"><p>Investigation</p></fn><fn fn-type="con" id="con4"><p>Supervision, Funding acquisition</p></fn><fn fn-type="con" id="con5"><p>Conceptualization, Resources, Formal analysis, Supervision, Funding acquisition, Investigation, Visualization, Writing â original draft, Project administration, Writing â review and editing</p></fn></fn-group><fn-group content-type="ethics-information"><title>Ethics</title><fn fn-type="other"><p>All animal experiments were approved by the Institutional Animal Care and Use Committee at RIKEN Kobe Branch (IACUC).</p></fn></fn-group></sec><sec sec-type="supplementary-material" id="s6"><title>Additional files</title><supplementary-material id="supp1"><label>Supplementary file 1.</label><caption><title>Plasmids used in this study.</title></caption><media xlink:href="elife-98612-supp1-v1.xlsx" mimetype="application" mime-subtype="xlsx"/></supplementary-material><supplementary-material id="supp2"><label>Supplementary file 2.</label><caption><title>Oligonucleotides used in this study.</title></caption><media xlink:href="elife-98612-supp2-v1.xlsx" mimetype="application" mime-subtype="xlsx"/></supplementary-material><supplementary-material id="mdar"><label>MDAR checklist</label><media xlink:href="elife-98612-mdarchecklist1-v1.docx" mimetype="application" mime-subtype="docx"/></supplementary-material></sec><sec sec-type="data-availability" id="s7"><title>Data availability</title><p>All data generated or analyzed in this study are included in the manuscript and associated source data files.

We have taken on board the reviewerâs suggestion and examined the expression of NHE1 and SWELL1 in endothelial cells using published scRNAseq of 24 hpf ECs (Gurung et al, 2022, Sci. Rep.). We found that <italic>slc9a1a, slc9a6a, slc9a7, slc9a8, lrrc8aa</italic> and <italic>lrrc8ab</italic> are expressed in different endothelial subtypes. To examine the function of NHE1 and SWELL1 in endothelial cell migration, we used the pharmacological compounds, 5-(N-ethyl-Nisopropyl)amiloride (EIPA) and DCPIB, respectively. While we were unable to observe an ISV phenotype after EIPA treatment at 5, 10 and 50ÂµM, we were able to observe impaired ISV formation after DCPIB treatment that was very similar to that observed in Aquaporin mutants. We were very encouraged by these results and proceeded to perform more detailed experiments whose results have yielded a new figure (Figure 6) and are described and discussed in lines 266 to 289 and 396 to 407, respectively, in the revised manuscript.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>(2) In some places the discussion seems a little confusing where the text goes from hydrostatic pressure to osmotic gradient.

Kondrychyn I. et al. provide data that indicate a requirement for zebrafish aquaporins 1 and 8, in cellular water inflow and sprouting angiogenesis. Zebrafish mutants lacking aqp1a.1 and aqp8a.1 have significantly lower tip cell volume and migration velocity, which delays vascular development. Inhibition of actin formation and filopodia dynamics further aggravates this phenotype. The link between water inflow, hydrostatic pressure, and actin dynamics driving endothelial cell sprouting and migration during angiogenesis is highly novel.</p><p>Strengths:</p><p>The zebrafish genetics, microscopy imaging, and measurements performed are of very high quality. The study data and interpretations are very well-presented in this manuscript.</p><p>Weaknesses:</p><p>Some of the mechanobiology findings and interpretations could be strengthened by more advanced measurements and experimental manipulations. Also, a better comparison and integration of the authors' findings, with other previously published findings in mice and zebrafish would strengthen the paper.</p></disp-quote><p>We thank Reviewer #2 for the critique that the paper can be strengthened by more advanced measurements and experimental manipulations. One of the technical challenges that we face is how to visualize and measure water flow directly in the zebrafish. We have therefore taken indirect approaches to assess water abundance in endothelial cells in vivo. One approach was to measure the diffusion of GEM nanoparticles in tip cell cytoplasm in wildtype and Aquaporin mutants, but results were inconclusive. The second was to measure the volume of tip cells, which should reflect water in/outflow. As the second approach produced clear and robust differences between wildtype ECs, ECs lacking Aqp1a.1 and Aqp8a.1 and ECs overexpressing Aqp1a.1 (revised Fig. 5), we decided to present these data in this manuscript.</p><p>We have also taken Reviewer 2 advice to better incorporate previously published data in our discussion (see below and lines 374 to 383 of the revised manuscript).</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p><bold>Reviewer #2 (Recommendations For The Authors):</bold></p><p>I have a few comments that the authors may address to further improve their manuscript analysis, quality, and impact.</p><p>Major comments:</p><p>(1) Citation and discussion of published literature</p></disp-quote><p>The authors have failed to cite and discuss recently published results on the role of aqp1a.1 and aqp8a.1 in ISV formation and caliber in zebrafish (Chen C et al. Cardiovascular Research 2024). That study showed a similar impairment of ISV formation when aqp1a.1 is absent but demonstrated a stronger phenotype on ISV morphology in the absence of aqp8a.1 than the current manuscript by Kondrychyn I et al. Furthermore, Chen C et al show an overall decrease in ISV diameter in single aquaporin mutants suggesting that the cell volume of all ECs in an ISV is affected equally. Given this published data, are ISV diameters affected in single and double mutants in the current study by Kondrochyn I et al? An overall effect on ISVs would suggest that aquaporin-mediated cell volume changes are not an inherent feature of endothelial tip cells. The authors need to analyse/compare and discuss all differences and similarities of their findings to what has been published recently.</p><p>We apologise for having failed and discussed the recently published paper by Chen et al. This has been corrected and discussed in lines 374 to 383.</p><p>In the paper by Chen et al, the authors describe a role of Aqp1a.1 and Aqp8a.1 in regulating ISV diameter (ISV diameter was analysed at 48 hpf) but they did not examine the earlier stages of sprouting angiogenesis between 20 to 30 hpf, which is the focus of our study. We therefore cannot directly compare the ISV phenotypes with theirs. Nevertheless, we recognise that there are differences in ISV phenotypes from 2 dpf. For example, they did not observe incompletely formed or missing ISVs at 2 and 3 dpf, which we clearly observe in our study. This could be explained by differences in the mutations generated. In Chen et al., the sgRNA used targeted the end of exon 2 that resulted in the generation of a 169 amino acid truncated aqp1a.1 protein. However, in our approach, our sgRNA targeted exon 1 of the gene that resulted in a truncated aqp1a.1 protein that is 76 amino acid long. As for the <italic>aqp8a.1</italic> zebrafish mutant that we generated, our sgRNA targeted exon 1 of the gene that resulted in a truncated protein that is 73 amino acids long. In Chen et al., the authors did not generate an <italic>aqp8a.1</italic> mutant but instead used a crispant approach, which leads to genetic mosaicism and high experimental variability.</p><p>Following the reviewerâs suggestion, we have now measured the diameters of arterial ISVs (aISVs) and venous ISVs (vISVs) in <italic>aqp1a.1-/-</italic>, <italic>aqp8a.1-/-</italic> and <italic>aqp1a.1-/-</italic>;<italic>aqp8a.1-/-</italic> zebrafish.

In fact, we often observed wider ISVs adjacent to unperfused ISVs (Fig. 3J) as more blood flow enters the lumenized ISV. Therefore, to determine the cell autonomous function of Aquaporin in mediating cell volume changes in vessel diameter regulation, one would need to perform cell transplantation experiments where we would measure the volume of single <italic>aqp1a.1-/-</italic>;<italic>aqp8a.1-/-</italic> endothelial cells in wildtype embryos with normal blood flow.

If aquaporin-mediated water inflow occurs locally at the leading edge of endothelial tip cells (Figure 2, line 314-318), why doesn't cytoplasmic volume expand specifically only at that location (as shown in immune cells by Boer et al. 2023)? Can the observed reduction in cytoplasmic volume simply be a side-effect of impaired filopodia formation (Figure 4F-I)?</p></disp-quote><p>We believe that water influx not only expands filopodia but also the leading front of tip cells (see bracket region in Fig. 4D), where Aqp1a.1-mEmerald/Aqp8a.1-mEmerald accumulate (Fig. 2), to generate an elongated protrusion and forward expansion of the tip cell. The decrease in cytoplasmic volume observed in the <italic>aqp1a.1;aqp8a.1</italic> double mutant zebrafish is a result of decreased formation of these elongated protrusions at the leading front of migration tip cells as shown in Fig. 4E (compare to Fig. 4D), not from just a decrease in filopodia number. In fact, in the method used to quantify cell volume, mEmerald/EGFP localization is limited to the cytoplasm and does not label filopodia well (compare mEmerald/EGFP in green with membrane tagged-mCherry in Fig. 5A - C). The volume measured therefore reflects cytoplasmic volume of the tip cell, not filopodia volume.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Do the authors have data on cytoplasmic volume changes of endothelial tip cells in latrunculin B treated fish?

However, in the current manuscript by Kondrychyn I. et al. this has not been analysed carefully. In Movie S4 the authors indicate by arrows tip cells that fail to invade the zebrafish trunk demonstrating a severe defect of sprouting initiation in these mutants. Yet, when only looking at ISVs that reach the dorsal side in Movie S4, it appears that they are comprised of fewer EC nuclei/ISV than the ISVs in Movie S3. At the beginning of DLAV formation, most ISVs in control Movie S3 consist of 3-4 EC nuclei, while in double mutants Movie S4 it appears to be only 2-3 EC nuclei. At the end of the Movie S4, one ISV on the left side even appears to consist of only a single EC when touching the dorsal roof. The authors provide convincing data on how the absence of aquaporin channels affects sprouting initiation and migration speed, resulting in severe delay in ISV formation. However, the authors should also analyse EC proliferation, as it may also be affected in these mutants, and may also contribute to the observed phenotype. We know that effects on cell migration may indirectly change the number of cells and proliferation at the ISVs, but this has not been carefully analysed in this paper.</p></disp-quote><p>We thank the reviewer for highlighting the lack of information on EC number and division in the aquaporin mutants.

However, because tjp1-tdTomato is expressed in all cell types including the skin that lies just above the ISV and the signal in ECs in ISVs is very weak at 22 to 25 hpf, it was very difficult to obtain good quality images that can properly delineate cell boundaries to determine the number of cells in the ISVs at this early stage.

Unlike the mouse retina where it has been demonstrated that two endothelial cells can occupy the tip cell position side-by-side (Pelton et al., 2014), this is usually not observed in zebrafish ISVs. This is demonstrated in Movie S3, where it is clear that one nucleus (belonging to the tip cell) occupies the tip of the growing ISV. The accumulation of intracellular membranes is often observed in tip cells that may serve as a reservoir of membranes for the generation of membrane protrusions at the leading edge of tip cells.</p><p>We agree that by generating transgenic <italic>Tg(fli1ep:aqp1a.1-mEmerald)</italic> and <italic>Tg(fli1ep:aqp8a.1mEmerald)</italic> zebrafish, Aqp1a.1 and Aqp8a.1 are overexpressed that may affect their localization.

As demonstrated in Fig. 4, most of the phenotypes can be explained by the delayed emergence of tip cells from the dorsal aorta and slower tip cell migration. However, in some instances, we also observed retraction of tip cells (Movie S4) and failure of tip cells to emerge from the dorsal aorta or endothelial cell death (see attached figure on page 14), which can give rise to the Class II phenotype. In the dominant class I phenotype (in contrast to class II), secondary sprouting from the posterior cardinal vein is unaffected, and the secondary sprout migrates dorsally passing the level of horizontal myoseptum but cannot complete the formation of vISV (it stops beneath the spinal cord). The Class III phenotype appears to result from a failure of the secondary sprout to fuse with the regressed primary ISV. In the Class IV phenotype, the ventral EC does not maintain a connection to the dorsal aorta.
