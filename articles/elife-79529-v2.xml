relationship has not been deeply explored in the vascular endothelium. Endothelial cells (ECs) rapidly respond to extrinsic signals, such as tissue damage or microbial infection, by upregulating factors to activate and recruit circulating leukocytes to the site of injury and aberrant activation of ECs leads to inflammatory based diseases, such as multiple sclerosis and atherosclerosis. Here, we studied the role of cholesterol and a key transcription regulator of cholesterol homeostasis, SREBP2, in the EC responses to inflammatory stress. Treatment of primary human ECs with pro-inflammatory cytokines upregulated SREBP2 cleavage and cholesterol biosynthetic gene expression within the late phase of the acute inflammatory response. Furthermore, SREBP2 activation was dependent on NF-κB DNA binding and canonical SCAP-SREBP2 processing. Mechanistically, inflammatory activation of SREBP was mediated by a reduction in accessible cholesterol, leading to heightened sterol sensing and downstream SREBP2 cleavage. Detailed analysis of NF-κB inducible genes that may impact sterol sensing resulted in the identification of a novel <italic>RELA</italic>-inducible target, <italic>STARD10</italic>, that mediates accessible cholesterol homeostasis in ECs.

Undoubtedly, leukocytes are crucial for host defense and tissue repair, regulating the balance between resolution and chronic inflammation. However, the endothelium plays a significant role in the overall inflammatory response, particularly in initiation and vascular maintenance. Endothelial cells (ECs) are in constant contact with the bloodstream and rapidly change their phenotype in response to inflammatory stimuli. Inflammatory cytokines, such as tumor necrosis factor alpha (TNFα) and interleukin-1 beta (IL1β), bind to their respective receptors to activate I-κ-kinase, which phosphorylates and degrades inhibitory IκBα and releases the key inflammatory transcription factor, NF-κB, to the nucleus (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">DiDonato et al., 1997</xref>). NF-κB, along with other activated transcription factors, such as activator protein 1 (AP1) upregulate the transcription of several inflammatory response genes that increase (1) vascular permeability, (2) leukocyte chemoattraction, and (3) immune cell adhesion and extravasation into tissue (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">Pober and Sessa, 2007</xref>). Indeed, the vascular endothelium is a primary sensor of the circulating bloodstream and is exposed to various stimuli that regulate systemic host defense responses.</p><p>It is becoming increasingly appreciated that there exists a connection between cellular immunity and cholesterol. Cellular lipid and cholesterol homeostasis are tightly regulated by the transcription factor sterol response element binding protein (SREBP). At sufficient cellular cholesterol levels, SREBP is retained as a full-length protein in the endoplasmic reticulum (ER) bound to adaptor proteins SREBP cleavage-activating protein (SCAP) and inhibitory insulin-induced gene (INSIG) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Brown and Goldstein, 1997</xref>). When cellular cholesterol levels decrease, the SCAP-SREBP complex translocates to the Golgi where SREBP is proteolytically cleaved by proteases, S1P and S2P. Cleavage results in the release of the N-terminal fragment of SREBP into the cytoplasm, which translocates to the nucleus to bind to DNA and initiate gene transcription. SREBP1a and SREBP1c isoforms predominantly activate the expression of genes involved in fatty acid synthesis and the SREBP2 isoform upregulates genes that increase cellular cholesterol by de novo synthesis and exogenous uptake (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Horton et al., 2002</xref>).</p><p>The relationship between SREBP2, cholesterol homeostasis, and immune phenotype has been predominantly studied in leukocyte immunobiology. First, it has been suggested SREBP2 directly modulates immune responses. In macrophages, it was found that the SCAP/SREBP2 shuttling complex directly interacts with the NLRP3 inflammasome and regulates inflammasome activation via translocation from ER to Golgi (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Guo et al., 2018</xref>). Another group found that SREBP2 was highly activated in macrophages treated with TNFα and that nuclear SREBP2 bound to inflammatory and interferon response target genes to promote an M1-like inflammatory state (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Kusnadi et al., 2019</xref>). Second, several studies have shown that cellular cholesterol levels control immune phenotype. Type I interferon (IFN) signaling in macrophages decreases cholesterol synthesis, allowing for activation of STING on the ER to feed forward and enhance IFN signaling (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib46">York et al., 2015</xref>). Furthermore, decreasing cholesterol synthesis via <italic>Srebf2</italic> knockout was sufficient to activate the type I IFN response. Mevalonate, an intermediate in the cholesterol biosynthetic pathway, can regulate trained immunity in monocytes. Patients lacking mevalonate kinase accumulate mevalonate and develop hyper immunoglobulin D syndrome (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Bekkering et al., 2018</xref>). On the other hand, studies have indicated that bacterial lipopolysaccharide (LPS) or type I IFNs can actively suppress synthesis of cholesterol in macrophages and that restoring cholesterol biosynthesis promotes inflammation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Araldi et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Dang et al., 2017</xref>).</p><p>Despite the importance of the endothelium in the inflammatory response, the link between inflammation and cholesterol homeostasis is not well studied in ECs. There is evidence that increased activation of SREBP2 and cholesterol loading in ECs are pro-inflammatory, but these studies were largely focused on models of atherosclerosis and did not focus on the mechanism of activation, flux of the discrete pools of cholesterol and/or sterol sensing in ECs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib44">Xiao et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib43">Westerterp et al., 2016</xref>). Here we show an intimate relationship between inflammatory signaling and cholesterol homeostasis in EC. Tumor necrosis factor α (TNFα) rapidly activates NF-κB resulting in a time-dependent activation of SREBP2 and SREBP2 dependent gene expression. The activation of SREBP occurs via TNF mediated stimulation of NF-κB and changes in the accessible cholesterol pool that promote sterol sensing but not via other post-translational mechanism. Mechanistically, we show that TNFα induction of the NF-κB inducible gene, <italic>STARD10,</italic> in part<italic>,</italic> mediates the changes in accessible cholesterol leading to heightened SREBP activation. Thus, EC respond to inflammatory cytokine challenges by reducing the accessible cholesterol pool on the plasma membrane thereby inducing canonical SREBP processing and gene expression leading to inflammation.</p></sec><sec id="s2" sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><sec id="s2-1"><title>TNFα and RELA transcriptionally regulate canonical SREBP-dependent gene expression</title><p>Primary HUVEC were treated with TNFα (10 ng/mL) for 4 and 10 hr followed by RNA-seq analysis to uncover the transcriptional changes at peak and later stages of activation, respectively.

Furthermore, Upstream Regulator analysis restricted to transcription factors predicted that SREBF1 was significantly activated in these cells.

HUVEC were treated overnight in LPDS with or without the addition of 25 μg/mL LDL, to suppress SREBP2 cleavage and LDLR expression (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2c</xref>). LDL treatment decreased LDLR protein levels in HUVEC at rest and TNFα significantly increased LDLR levels in HUVEC cultured in both LPDS and LPDS +LDL. Exogenous LDL was also able to partially suppress LDLR expression, indicating that this process is sterol-sensitive. Similar results were found for another well-known SREBP2 target of cholesterol biosynthesis, HMGCR (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s1">Figure 2—figure supplement 1c</xref>). Next, we tested fluorescently labeled LDL uptake as a functional readout of the increase in LDLR as quantified by flow cytometry.

For canonical NF-κB signaling, TNFα activates the immediate post-translational activation of the NF-κB complex via phosphorylation and degradation of the inhibitory molecule IκBα by I-κ-kinase (IKK) isoforms (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">DiDonato et al., 1997</xref>). However, TNFα has been shown to upregulate several other signaling pathways, such as JNK, p38, and ERK1/2 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Aggarwal, 2003</xref>). Therefore, we sought to confirm that NF-κB signaling is necessary for SREBP2 activation in ECs undergoing inflammatory stress. Treatment of HUVEC with TNFα, IL1β, and lipopolysaccharide (LPS) to activate NF-κB through separate pathways led to an increase in SREBP2 cleavage and upregulation of LDLR levels (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3a</xref>) with concomitant increases in ICAM1 as a positive control. Furthermore, pre-treatment of HUVEC with the transcription inhibitor, Actinomycin D (ActD), blunted activation of SREBP2, LDLR and ICAM1 in response to TNFα (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3b, c</xref>).

Accessible cholesterol can be quantified using modified recombinant bacterial toxins that bind in a 1:1 molar ratio to accessible free cholesterol on the plasma membrane (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Gay et al., 2015</xref>). To examine accessible cholesterol in EC, we purified His-tagged anthrolysin O (ALOD4) and used it as a probe (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Endapally et al., 2019a</xref>). To assess the utility of the probe in HUVEC, cells were incubated with Chol, LDL or with methyl-β-cyclodextrin (MβCD, a cholesterol acceptor) and ALOD4 bound was quantified by probing for anti-HIS at 15 kDa by western blotting. As expected, treatment with Chol or LDL increased ALOD4 binding, whereas MβCD decreased ALOD4 binding (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5s1">Figure 5—figure supplement 1a</xref>). Secondly, a similar method was used, but instead of cell lysis, DyLight680-conjugated anti-HIS antibody was directly applied to the ALOD4-incubated cells and read live on LICOR Biosciences Odyssey CLx platform (In-Cell Western Blot). Likewise, the positive controls were able to tightly regulate ALOD4 binding and fluorescence signal (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5s1">Figure 5—figure supplement 1b</xref>).</p><p>TNFα treatment of HUVEC significantly decreased ALOD4 binding (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5c</xref>).

This suggests that the decrease in accessible cholesterol was independent of SREBP2 stability. Probing accessible cholesterol throughout an 8 hr timecourse revealed that ALOD4 binding significantly decreased as early as 4 hr after TNFα treatment in HUVEC treated with and without PF-429242 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5e</xref>).

STARD10 belongs to a family of proteins that bind hydrophobic lipids via a structurally conserved steroidogenic acute regulatory-related lipid transfer (START) domain (Clark, 2020). STARD proteins regulate non-vesicular trafficking of cholesterol, phospholipids, and sphingolipids between membranes. <italic>STARD10</italic> was found to be upregulated by TNFα after 4 and 10 hr of treatment and inhibited by loss of <italic>RELA</italic> (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6a</xref>). <italic>STARD4</italic> also shared this expression pattern, however, it is a sterol-sensitive gene and its upregulation by TNFα most likely occurred via SREBP2 activation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">Soccio et al., 2005</xref>). Analysis of RELA chromatin ChIP-seq data revealed increased occupancy of RELA within the <italic>STARD10</italic> promoter in ECs treated with IL1β or TNFα (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6b</xref>). Immunoblotting confirmed what was indicated by the RNA-seq and ChIP-seq results, revealing that STARD10 was significantly upregulated by TNFα and its expression was dependent on RELA (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6c</xref>). STARD10 has been shown to bind phosphatidylcholine (PC), phosphatidylethanolamine (PE), and phosphatidylinositol (PI), but much of its detailed biology remains unknown (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">Olayioye et al., 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Carrat et al., 2020</xref>). Although it has not been shown to directly bind cholesterol, STARD10 may be implicated in the reorganization of membrane phospholipids that could alter cholesterol flux and shield cholesterol localization (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib40">Tabas, 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Mesmin and Maxfield, 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Lagace, 2015</xref>).</p><p>We next knocked down STARD10 to analyze its role in cholesterol homeostasis and EC inflammatory response. Treatment of ECs with two independent siRNAs targeting STARD10 significantly decreased <italic>STARD10</italic> expression and attenuated the enhanced expression of SREBP2 target genes <italic>HMGCS1, HMGCR,</italic> and <italic>LDLR</italic> (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6d</xref>). Furthermore, STARD10 knockdown significantly rescued the loss in accessible cholesterol that occurs with TNFα stimulation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6e</xref>). SREBP2 activation and LDLR upregulation were also attenuated with STARD10 silencing. Therefore, we have identified a novel RELA-inducible gene in ECs that mediates the cholesterol homeostasis in response to inflammatory stress.</p></sec></sec><sec id="s3" sec-type="discussion"><title>Discussion</title><p>Little is known about cholesterol metabolism and homeostasis in ECs in the context of physiology or pathology. Here, we show that TNFαand IL-1β induce a transcriptional response via NF-κB that alters cholesterol homeostasis in ECs (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7</xref>). Accordingly, rapid changes in accessible cholesterol then activates SREBP2 processing to compensate for the altered flux of accessible cholesterol between the plasma membrane and ER. Importantly, we identified a novel NF-κB-inducible gene, <italic>STARD10</italic>, that serves as an intermediate bridging TNF activation to changes in accessible cholesterol and SREBP2 activation. Collectively, these data support the growing evidence for an intimate relationship between inflammatory signaling and cholesterol homeostasis.</p><fig id="fig7" position="float"><label>Figure 7.</label><caption><title>Working model of the relationship between sterol sensing and EC acute inflammatory response.</title><p>Pro-inflammatory cytokines, such as TNFα and IL1β, promote NF-κB activation of gene transcription in endothelial cells. NF-κB upregulates factors, such as <italic>STARD10</italic>, that significantly decrease accessible cholesterol on the plasma membrane. SCAP senses the reduction in accessible cholesterol and shuttles SREBP2 to the Golgi to initiate classical proteolytic processing. Active N-SREBP2 translocates to the nucleus to transcriptionally upregulate canonical cholesterol biosynthetic genes.</p></caption><graphic mimetype="image" mime-subtype="tiff" xlink:href="elife-79529-fig7-v2.tif"/></fig><p>Different forms of cellular stress have been shown to activate SREBP2 in multiple cell types, including oscillatory shear stress in ECs, ER stress in hepatocytes, and TNFα in macrophages (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib44">Xiao et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Kim et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Kusnadi et al., 2019</xref>). However, these studies did not implicate changes in cholesterol accessibility as an upstream mechanism leading to the activation of SREBP2. Here, we clearly demonstrate that activation of NF-kB leads to changes in the accessible cholesterol pool promoting classical SREBP2 processing in a SCAP-dependent manner. Epithelial cells treated with IFNγ-stimulated macrophage conditioned media rapidly reduce accessible cholesterol to protect against bacterial infection by preventing cholesterol-mediated transport between cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Abrams et al., 2020</xref>). Similarly, macrophages deplete accessible cholesterol to protect against bacterial toxin-mediated injury (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib47">Zhou et al., 2020</xref>). In both of these studies, accessible cholesterol was mediated by IFN-induction of the enzyme, cholesterol 25-hydroxylase (Ch25H), which produces 25-HC as a product and enhances the esterification of cholesterol. However, Ch25H is not expressed ECs with or without TNFα and cholesterol does not mobilize into the lipid droplet pool. Nonetheless, EC depletion of accessible cholesterol may be an evolutionary mechanism of host immunity.</p><p>In the present study, we show that TNFα activation of NF-κB induces the expression of the gene, STARD10. Although little is known about the physiological function of STARD10, it may influence cholesterol homeostasis in several ways. Firstly, it has been reported that STARD10 can directly bind PC, PE, and PI and may alter intracellular membrane dynamics to influence the flux of cholesterol. It has been suggested PC plays a role in cholesterol sequestration either by steric hindrance from by its polar head group or through the creation of novel membranes that may sink cholesterol out of the accessible pool (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Mesmin and Maxfield, 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Lagace, 2015</xref>). Furthermore, STARD10 belongs to a classical family of lipid transporters and may bind lipids not previously reported. As a novel NFκB inducible gene, STARD10 regulation of cholesterol homeostasis is a novel concept that warrants further investigation.</p><p>Previous studies indicate that SREBP2 activation feeds forward into the inflammatory response and exacerbates inflammatory damage. Firstly, SREBP2 has been shown to regulate inflammatory phenotype via modulation of cholesterol homeostasis. Increased cholesterol flux has been reported to feed into multiple immune pathways, such as interferon responses, inflammasome activation, and trained immunity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib46">York et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Dang et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Bekkering et al., 2018</xref>). Furthermore, perturbations in cellular cholesterol may change membrane dynamics and affect cellular signaling (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Araldi et al., 2017</xref>). Secondly, SREBP2 has been proposed to bind and promote transcription of several pro-inflammatory mediators, such as <italic>IL1β</italic>, <italic>IL8, NLRP3,</italic> and <italic>NOX2</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Kusnadi et al., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib44">Xiao et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib45">Yeh et al., 2004</xref>). SREBP2 binding to non-classical gene promotors may very well depend on cellular and epigenetic context. How SREBP2 feeds into post-translational inflammatory response phenotype of ECs, such as permeability, sensitivity to infection, and receptor signaling, remains to be explored.</p><p>This study extends a growing body of work identifying a tight relationship between cholesterol homeostasis, inflammation and immunity. Although we have shown EC response to inflammatory cytokines in the acute setting, much remains to be explored in the context of chronic inflammation. Of particular interest, it has been well appreciated that the endothelium plays an important role in the progression of atherosclerosis. Chronic exposure to elevated lipoproteins causes accumulation of LDL in the subendothelial layer and activation of the endothelium (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Libby et al., 2019</xref>). This leads to an inflammatory cascade that causes a cycle of leukocyte recruitment and inflammatory activation. In this pathological context, ECs are exposed to a unique microenvironment composed of relatively high concentrations of cholesterol and cytokines. Thus, elucidating how the endothelium in vivo responds to the loss of <italic>Srebf2</italic> in mouse models of acute and chronic inflammation will be important delineate the role of EC cholesterol homeostasis in vascular health and disease.</p></sec><sec id="s4" sec-type="materials|methods"><title>Materials and methods</title><sec id="s4-1"><title>Mammalian cell culture</title><p>HUVECs were obtained from the Yale School of Medicine, Vascular Biology and Therapeutics Core facility.

Your article has been reviewed by 2 peer reviewers, and the evaluation has been overseen by a Reviewing Editor and Mone Zaidi as the Senior Editor. The reviewers have opted to remain anonymous.</p><p>The reviewers have discussed their reviews with one another, and the Reviewing Editor has drafted this to help you prepare a revised submission.</p><p>Essential revisions:</p><p>You will see that one reviewer (#1) had a number of clarifications and extensions of your results that are not expected to involve significant experimental work. Reviewer #3 and I (in discussions after the reviews were received) agreed with the editorial changes requested by reviewer #1. Thus, please address all of them. In terms of data clarification/extension, please address reviewer 1's requests:</p><p>1) Figure 3b: quantification of full length vs cleaved SREBP2.</p><p>2) Figure 6: RELA occupancy of other potential RELA-dependent genes.</p><p>3) Western blots of STARD10 after TNF treatment or RELA knockdown.</p><p><italic>Reviewer #1 (Recommendations for the authors):</italic></p><p>Overall this is a very thorough set of experiments and a well-written manuscript. There are a few areas that could be strengthened.</p><p>Figure 2 b: The rapid activation of NF-Kappa-B genes by TNF is likely a result of RNA polymerase being poised at the promoter for rapid response (see PMID: 19820169). It might be useful to mention this in the results or discussion as an explanation for the lag in the induction of the SREBP2 genes relative to the NF-Kappa-B targets.</p><p>Figure 3b: The authors should quantitate the full length vs cleaved SREBP2 upon Actinomycin D vs vehicle treatment. It's difficult to glean the main point from this figure since there appears to be less of the unprocessed form of SREBP upon Actinomycin D treatment.</p><p>Figure 6a: There were several other lipid mediator genes (other than STARD10) that are RELA dependent. It would be useful to see if the other genes also show RELA occupancy, which could help determine specificity as it is likely that STARD10 is not the whole story. It would also be useful to discuss one or two of these other factors and how they might (or might not) impact cholesterol accessibility.</p><p>There were no western blots of STARD10 upon TNF stimulation or RELA knockdown. It would be important to know whether the STARD10 protein abundance is reduced by the siRNA as much as the mRNA since the effect of STARD10 depletion on SREBP2 cleavage is modest (Figure 6D).</p><p>In figure 6c, there needs to be a scale on the ChIP seq data of RELA with STARD10 since the tracks without this are not very meaningful. Also, the authors might not want to use the term &quot;strong&quot; binding of RELA to the STARD10 promoter (strong relative to what?) in the Results section but rather state that there is an increase in occupancy of RELA upon TNF and IL1B stimulation.</p><p>This reviewer has never liked the use of the term &quot;master&quot; regulator for transcription factors. We know SREBP is a key regulator of cholesterol biosynthesis gene expression, but this terminology is outdated and potentially offensive to some readers. I would suggest removing it from the manuscript.</p></body></sub-article><sub-article article-type="reply" id="sa2"><front-stub><article-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.79529.sa2</article-id><title-group><article-title>Author response</article-title></title-group></front-stub><body><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Reviewer #1 (Recommendations for the authors):</p><p>Overall this is a very thorough set of experiments and a well-written manuscript.
