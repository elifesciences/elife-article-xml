However, only a handful of endogenous proteins encoded by putative lncRNAs have been identified and assigned a function. Here, we report the discovery of a putative gastrointestinal-tract-specific lncRNA (<italic>LINC00675</italic>) that is regulated by the pioneer transcription factor FOXA1 and encodes a conserved small protein of 79 amino acids which we termed FORCP (<italic>FO</italic>XA1-<italic>R</italic>egulated <italic>C</italic>onserved Small <italic>P</italic>rotein). <italic>FORCP</italic> transcript is undetectable in most cell types but is abundant in well-differentiated colorectal cancer (CRC) cells where it functions to inhibit proliferation, clonogenicity, and tumorigenesis. The epitope-tagged and endogenous FORCP protein predominantly localizes to the endoplasmic reticulum (ER). In response to ER stress, <italic>FORCP</italic> depletion results in decreased apoptosis. Our findings on the initial characterization of <italic>FORCP</italic> demonstrate that FORCP is a novel, conserved small protein encoded by a mis-annotated lncRNA that regulates apoptosis and tumorigenicity in well-differentiated CRC cells.</p></abstract><kwd-group

Although the vast majority of lncRNAs have not been functionally characterized, some have established functions in development and disease (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Fatica and Bozzoni, 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">Li and Chang, 2014</xref>) and control diverse cellular processes including dosage compensation, differentiation, proliferation, apoptosis, metastasis, DNA repair, and genome stability maintenance (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Fatica and Bozzoni, 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Lee et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib43">Munschauer et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib53">Sharma et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Arun et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib51">Sahakyan et al., 2018</xref>). lncRNA expression is frequently altered in cancer (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib49">Prensner and Chinnaiyan, 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Huarte and Rinn, 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Huarte, 2015</xref>). We and others have shown that some lncRNAs play important roles in mediating the effects of tumor-suppressive transcription factors such as p53 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Chaudhary et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Li et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Adriaens et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Hünten et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">Léveillé et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Grossi et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib42">Marín-Béjar et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Huarte et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Chaudhary and Lal, 2017</xref>). Investigating the molecular and cellular functions of lncRNAs could uncover their roles in cancer and lay the foundation for future translational research.</p><p>Unlike mRNAs that are predominantly cytoplasmic, lncRNAs can be nuclear and/or cytoplasmic (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Cabili et al., 2015</xref>).

Having set up specific pulldown of the FORCP-FLAG protein, we performed pulldowns from four biological replicates followed by mass spectrometry. To reduce the number of false positives, we intersected the list of proteins enriched in our pulldowns with CRAPOME, a publicly available online tool that shows if a protein of interest is a common contaminant in more than 400 pulldown experiments. We found 16 FORCP-FLAG-interacting proteins enriched in all four pulldowns (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="supp3">Supplementary file 3</xref>). Of these 16 proteins, seven appeared in less than 30 of the 411 experiments in the CRAPOME dataset (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4G</xref>). Of these seven proteins, we focused on BRI3BP (BRI3-binding protein) because it had been reported in a subnetwork of proteins important for ER biology (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Christianson et al., 2011</xref>). We next validated the interaction between FORCP-FLAG and BRI3BP by co-transfecting 293 T cells with constructs expressing FORCP-FLAG and BRI3BP-FLAG-Myc followed by anti-Myc IP and immunoblotting using an anti-FLAG antibody (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4H</xref>).

These data on the FORCP-BRI3BP interaction raise the possibility that FORCP could inhibit BRI3BP function or <italic>vice versa</italic> in the context of ER stress. However, this needs to be investigated in future studies. Together, our results indicate that <italic>FORCP</italic> is a novel protein-coding gene that was mis-annotated as a lncRNA.

Functionally, we found that <italic>FORCP</italic> inhibits proliferation at the basal level and is pro-apoptotic in the context of ER stress.</p><p>In contrast to current annotations and publications on this gene (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">Li et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib59">Zeng et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib61">Zhong et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib52">Shan et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">Ma et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">Li et al., 2018</xref>), we found that <italic>FORCP</italic> is mis-annotated as a lncRNA. Our discovery that <italic>FORCP</italic> is translated into a small protein contributes to the emerging notion that short ORFs are often hidden in lncRNAs and are translated into small proteins or micropeptides that play essential roles in regulation of fundamental biological processes in organisms ranging from bacteria to humans (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Hartford and Lal, 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib41">Makarewich and Olson, 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib57">Storz et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Leslie, 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib46">Orr et al., 2019</xref>). Although the exact molecular mechanisms by which these small proteins mediate their effects remains largely unclear, there is some evidence that the small size of these proteins can allow them to block or boost the activity of the larger proteins they interact with (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Leslie, 2019</xref>). For example, the micropeptide MOXI localizes to the inner mitochondrial membrane where it interacts with mitochondrial trifunctional protein (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib40">Makarewich et al., 2018b</xref>), whereas the micropeptide DWORF localizes to the sarcoplasmic reticulum in muscle cells where it enhances SERCA activity by displacing the SERCA inhibitors phospholamban, sarcolipin, and myoregulin (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib45">Nelson et al., 2016</xref>). In future studies, detailed investigation of the FORCP-BRI3BP interaction could help elucidate the precise mechanism(s) of its anti-proliferative functions and its role during ER stress. Because FORCP is localized to the ER, an organelle involved in the production, processing and transport of proteins and lipids in a cell, future studies that combine biochemical approaches with lipidomics and/or proteomics could help determine the exact molecular and cellular function(s) of FORCP. Given that we identified KDSR and CERS2 as FORCP-interacting proteins and that these proteins catalyze sequential steps in ceramide biosynthesis, it would be interesting to determine if FORCP has a role in ceramide biosynthesis. Additionally, determining the in vivo function of <italic>FORCP</italic> in mice could reveal a role of <italic>FORCP</italic> in normal colon biology and in colorectal cancer.</p><p>Our study emphasizes the need to identify the appropriate cell-type in which a lncRNA is robustly expressed. In the case of <italic>FORCP</italic>, we found that it is robustly expressed in normal human colon tissue and downregulated in CRC patients. Surprisingly, <italic>FORCP</italic> was not expressed in the commonly used CRC cell lines and in 57 cell lines in the NCI-60 panel. <italic>FORCP</italic> was abundant in well-differentiated CRC cells that are colon-like, consistent with high <italic>FORCP</italic> expression in the normal human colon tissue. Identifying the appropriate cell type was instrumental in the discovery of the FORCP protein, identification of FOXA1 as an upstream regulator of FORCP and for functional analysis. In summary, the discovery of <italic>FORCP</italic> as a novel protein-coding gene, together with recent reports on other lncRNA-encoded small proteins, reveals vital functions of small proteins translated from ORFs hidden in lncRNAs and underscores the need to determine the coding potential of cytoplasmic lncRNAs in an endogenous setting. Future studies will likely identify new mis-annotated lncRNAs that encode functional small proteins important for normal development and human diseases.</p></sec><sec id="s4" sec-type="materials|methods"><title>Materials and methods</title><sec id="s4-1"><title>Cell culture and siRNA transfections</title><p>HEK293T (293T), HCT116, SW48, SW480, RKO, C80, and LS180 cells were purchased from ATCC (Manassas, VA.).

One ml of urea buffer (50 mM HEPES, pH 8.0 and 8 M urea) was applied to each of the cell pellets. Cell lysates were sonicated on ice with three 5 s pulses (30 s pause between pulses). Lysates were cleared of cell debris by centrifugation at 14,000 rpm for 10 min at 4°C. Protein concentration was estimated using standard BCA assay. One hundred micrograms of lysate were reduced using dithiothreitol (Thermo Fisher) and alkylated with iodoacetamide (Thermo Fisher). Lysates were diluted to a final concentration of 2 M urea using 50 mM HEPES, pH 8.0 and proteins digested at 37°C overnight with 2 µg trypsin (Promega). Digestion was stopped by acidification of the extract using trifluoracetic acid and samples were vacuum centrifuged to dry. The first-dimension separation of the peptides was performed off line, using Waters Acquity HUPLC system with a fluorescence detector (Waters, Milford, MA) coupled to a 150 mm x 3.0 mm XBridge Peptide BEM 2. 5 µm C18 column (Waters, MA) operating at 0.35 ml/min. The dried peptides were reconstituted in 100 µl of mobile phase A (3 mM ammonium bicarbonate, pH 8.0). Mobile phase B was 100% acetonitrile (Thermo Fisher). The column was washed with mobile phase A for 10 min followed by gradient elution 0–50% B (10–60 min) and 50–75% B (60–75 min) and fraction collected every minute. The fractions, collected from minute 10 to 75, were consolidated into 24 pools, dried in SpeedVac and stored at −80°C until analysis by mass spectrometry. The dried peptide pools were reconstituted in 0.1% TFA and subjected to nanoflow liquid chromatography (200 nl/min) (Thermo Easy nLC 1000, Thermo Scientific) coupled to high-resolution tandem MS (Q Exactive, HF, Thermo Scientific). Data depended acquisition of top 20 ions was done at resolution of 60,000 for MS1 with the automatic gain control (AGC) set at 3e<sup>6</sup> over a mass range of 380–1580 m/z, followed by MS/MS analysis at a resolution of 15,000 with AGC set at 2e<sup>5</sup>. Precursor ion isolation width was set at 1.4 m/z and normalized collision energy at 27, and charge state one and unassigned charge states were excluded. Acquired MS/MS spectra were searched against a FASTA file containing all potential FORCP tryptic peptides, along with a contaminant protein database, using SEQUEST and percolator at 0.01% FDR in Proteome Discoverer 2.2 software (Thermo Scientific, CA). The precursor ion tolerance was set at 10 ppm and the fragment ions tolerance was set at 0.02 Da along with methionine oxidation included as dynamic modification.

you for sending your article entitled &quot;A small protein encoded by a putative lncRNA regulates apoptosis and tumorigenicity in human colorectal cancer cells&quot; for peer review at <italic>eLife</italic>. Your article is being evaluated by three peer reviewers, and the evaluation is being overseen by Maureen Murphy as the Senior and Reviewing Editor.</p><p>Summary:</p><p>This manuscript from the Lal lab describes the identification of a new micropeptide which they term FORCP encoded by an erroneously categorized lncRNA that is expressed in well-differentiated colon cancer cell lines. Using a combination of elegant bioinformatics and biochemical approaches, they report that the FORCP locus encodes for two exons and the spliced mRNA guides the expression of a small protein which can be detected by mass spectrometry and immunofluorescence. They localize this protein to the membrane of the ER and demonstrate that its expression can be induced by pharmacologically-induced ER stress. Using loss-of-function studies they describe tumor-suppressive effects of the encoded protein in in vitro and in vivo studies. The manuscript is well written and the results, for the most part, support the conclusions.</p><p>Essential revisions:</p><p>1) The concept that some (or many) lncRNAs actually encode small proteins is not new. As such the manuscript requires a much deeper mechanistic understanding of FORCP. Along these lines:</p><p>i) Identification of FORCP interacting proteins might provide allow the authors to elucidate a molecular function for this peptide, which would significantly increase the impact of this work.</p><p>ii) Alternatively, there is little insight here as to how FORCP functions in ER stress; the authors show that silencing FORCP leads to decreased induction of Bip and Chop, but this could be because silencing FORCP enhances cell death and these mRNAs are decreased. The manuscript ends with a bit of a disappointing note, and no hint as to the mechanism whereby FORCP works, in ER stress or in tumorigenesis or otherwise. Including clear data as to the mechanism whereby FORCP functions in ER stress or tumorigenesis would strengthen the impact of the work.</p><p>2) The most important technical weakness of this paper is the use of only a single siRNA pool for all the FORCP phenotypic experiments. Particularly because very general phenotypes are being studied (proliferation, cell death), it is essential that the authors do a better job of establishing the specificity of these results. Ideally, CRISPR would be used to knockout FORCP to confirm these findings. Although it may be difficult to grow the well-differentiated CRC cell lines as single cell clones, CRISPR knockouts can be highly effective in lentivirally-infected pools, so this is not a sufficient reason to avoid genome-editing experiments. Alternatively, it might be acceptable to use additional siRNAs and perform rescue experiments, but use of CRISPR would be more convincing. The authors would need to repeat all the experiments in Figures 6-7 with this additional loss-of-function approach.</p><p>3) The in vivo tumor growth data are lacking a clear description and appear to have been performed in non-conventional manner. Injecting 1 million cells embedded in Matrigel in the flank and reporting one volume measurement after 3 weeks does not provide sufficient detail into the effects of the studied protein. These studies must be performed and prevented more conventionally. In flank tumor models, tumor growth can be extended up to 1,000-1,500 cc and measurements on a daily or every other day should be reported. It is possible that the tumors did not grow at all, or grew very little as the data is presented. More importantly, there are no correlative studies to test the main findings in vitro, e.g., staining for Ki-67 or EdU incorporation (proliferation) and cleaved caspase-3/TUNEL (apoptosis) in the tumors. The inhibition of FORCP before injection of the tumors could very well have affected angiogenesis and not proliferation or resistance to apoptosis.</p><p>4) Mechanistically, the authors show that in vitro, FOXA1 binds to the promoter and an intronic region of FORCP gene. However, it is unclear if FOXA1 is required for the ER stress-dependent induction of FORCP.</p><p>5) In terms of ER stress, only two acute and non-physiological stresses, DTT and Tunicamycin were used. Since the authors suggest a tumor-suppressive role of FORCP, they should try more relevant stresses such as hypoxia and amino acid or glucose deprivation.</p><p>[Editors' note: further revisions were suggested prior to acceptance, as described below.]</p><p>Thank you for resubmitting your article &quot;A small protein encoded by a putative lncRNA regulates apoptosis and tumorigenicity in human colorectal cancer cells&quot; for consideration by <italic>eLife</italic>. Your revised article has been reviewed by three peer reviewers, and the evaluation has been overseen by a Reviewing Editor and Maureen Murphy as the Senior Editor. The following individual involved in review of your submission has agreed to reveal their identity: Constantinos Koumenis (Reviewer #2).</p><p>The reviewers have discussed the reviews with one another and the Reviewing Editor has drafted this decision to help you prepare a revised submission.</p><p>We would like to draw your attention to changes in our revision policy that we have made in response to COVID-19 (https://elifesciences.org/articles/57162). Specifically, when editors judge that a submitted work as a whole belongs in <italic>eLife</italic> but that some conclusions require a modest amount of additional new data, as they do with your paper, we are asking that the manuscript be revised to either limit claims to those supported by data in hand, or to explicitly state that the relevant conclusions require additional supporting data.</p><p>Our expectation is that the authors will eventually carry out the additional experiments and report on how they affect the relevant conclusions either in a preprint on bioRxiv or medRxiv, or if appropriate, as a Research Advance in <italic>eLife</italic>, either of which would be linked to the original paper.</p><p>Summary:</p><p>This manuscript convincingly demonstrates that LINC00675 encodes a conserved small protein, which the authors term FORCP, that is expressed in the GI tract and in well-differentiated CRC cell lines. FORCP localizes to the ER, slows proliferation of CRC cell lines in vitro, and promotes apoptosis after ER stress.</p><p>The revised manuscript has been reviewed by all three reviewers. All feel that the absence of functional information about the role of FORCP in ER stress is a weakness. The reviewers appear willing to consider this further if the following changes are made in a further revised manuscript.</p><p>Essential revisions:</p><p>1) I do not think that the polysome fractionation data in Figure 2B is interpretable without the A260 absorbance data, which is necessary to determine which fractions contain polysomes. As the data are presented now, this is just a sucrose gradient fractionation, showing that FORCP RNA associates with fractions in the middle of the gradient. FORCP could be polysome associated, or it could be associated with some other EDTA-sensitive complex. Given the weakness of these data, and the authors' inability to perform the appropriate analysis due to the pandemic, I suggest that these data be removed. There are sufficient other data to show that FORCP encodes a protein without this experiment.</p><p>2) The images in Figure 3C, which show endogenous FORCP protein, do not very convincingly show co-localization with PDI (there is clearly some co-localization, but the FORCP distribution appears to be broader). Quantification of co-localization in a larger number of cells should be provided.</p><p>3) The inclusion of additional, more physiological stressors in the experiments described in Figure 4 is a positive development. However, the use of CoCl<sub>2</sub> in lieu of &quot;true hypoxia&quot; (i.e., elicited by use of an environmental hypoxia chamber), is problematic. CoCl<sub>2</sub> &quot;mimics hypoxia&quot; only as far as induction of HIF-1a or HIF-2a is concerned, via inhibition of the activity of prolyl-hydroxylases and post-translational stabilization of those proteins. Induction of ER stress and the UPR by hypoxia depends on actual reduction in intracellular O<sub>2</sub> levels leading to accumulation of unfolded proteins. Therefore, Figure 4—figure supplement 3C should be removed and only the low glucose data be shown. A more detailed analysis on the role of FORCP in cell survival under hypoxia should be re-examined in more detail later.</p><p>4) The authors describe a proteomic study that identifies a protein associated with ER stress, BRI3BP. At the very least, presenting the IP-western indicating a functional interaction would provide some hint as to the mechanism whereby FORCP functions in ER stress; the authors would only have to present the proteomics and interaction and could save the remaining new data for a more comprehensive functional study.</p></body></sub-article><sub-article article-type="reply" id="sa2"><front-stub><article-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.53734.sa2</article-id><title-group><article-title>Author response</article-title></title-group></front-stub><body><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Essential revisions:</p><p>1) The concept that some (or many) lncRNAs actually encode small proteins is not new.

Of the 9 FORCP-interacting proteins we focused on BRI3BP, a transmembrane protein that is not well-characterized. Our rationale to focus on BRI3BP was based on some evidence in the literature that BRI3BP could have a function in ER stress (Christianson et al., 2011). We have gathered the following new data: (1) validation of the BRI3BP-FORCP interaction by co-IP, (2) colocalization of BRI3BP and FORCP in the ER using confocal microscopy, (3) during ER stress, knockdown of BRI3BP resulted in increased cell death whereas knockdown of FORCP resulted in decreased cell death, (4) concurrent knockdown on FORCP and BRI3BP significantly rescues cell viability during ER stress indicating a functional interaction between FORCP and BRI3BP. Overall, these results provide encouraging insights into the potential mechanism by which FORCP functions during ER stress.</p><p>However, determining the precise mechanism by which the FORCP-BRI3BP complex functions during ER stress will require many additional experiments.</p><p>As discussed with the editors and reviewers, we were not able to add this data due to space limitations.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>2) The most important technical weakness of this paper is the use of only a single siRNA pool for all the FORCP phenotypic experiments.

We found that, similar to our FORCP siRNA experiments, as compared to the FORCP-WT cells, isogenic FORCP-KO cells proliferate faster under untreated conditions and undergo decreased cell death during ER stress. These data validate the specificity of our results using siRNA pool against <italic>FORCP</italic>. Using the <italic>FORCP</italic>-WT and isogenic <italic>FORCP</italic>-KO LS180 cells, we have repeated the majority of the experiments, as suggested by the reviewers. The new data are presented in Figure 4D-H and Figure 4—figure supplement 3A-D of the revised manuscript.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>3) The in vivo tumor growth data are lacking a clear description and appear to have been performed in non-conventional manner. Injecting 1 million cells embedded in Matrigel in the flank and reporting one volume measurement after 3 weeks does not provide sufficient detail into the effects of the studied protein. These studies must be performed and prevented more conventionally. In flank tumor models, tumor growth can be extended up to 1,000-1,500 cc and measurements on a daily or every other day should be reported. It is possible that the tumors did not grow at all, or grew very little as the data is presented. More importantly, there are no correlative studies to test the main findings in vitro, e.g., staining for Ki-67 or EdU incorporation (proliferation) and cleaved caspase-3/TUNEL (apoptosis) in the tumors. The inhibition of FORCP before injection of the tumors could very well have affected angiogenesis and not proliferation or resistance to apoptosis.</p></disp-quote><p>Having generated the FORCP-KO cells, we were planning to do this in vivo experiment. However, we had to abruptly terminate this experiment due to the pandemic. Given that we would need at least 3 months to do this experiment and the uncertainty of the current situation, the editors and reviewers have kindly agreed to our request of not including these data.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>4) Mechanistically, the authors show that in vitro, FOXA1 binds to the promoter and an intronic region of FORCP gene. However, it is unclear if FOXA1 is required for the ER stress-dependent induction of FORCP.</p></disp-quote><p>During the revision, we have addressed this question. Our data indicate that FOXA1 may not be necessary for inducing FORCP expression during ER stress (Figure 4—figure supplement 1C).</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>5) In terms of ER stress, only two acute and non-physiological stresses, DTT and Tunicamycin were used. Since the authors suggest a tumor-suppressive role of FORCP, they should try more relevant stresses such as hypoxia and amino acid or glucose deprivation.</p></disp-quote><p>We have addressed this concern by conducting new experiments as suggested. Our data indicate that in the context of other stresses such as hypoxia and inhibition of glucose metabolism, FORCP-KO cells show significantly better than FORCP-WT cells (Figure 4—figure supplement 3C and D). The difference in survival was modest but significant.</p><p>[Editors' note: further revisions were suggested prior to acceptance, as described below.]</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Essential revisions:</p><p>1) I do not think that the polysome fractionation data in Figure 2B is interpretable without the A260 absorbance data, which is necessary to determine which fractions contain polysomes. As the data are presented now, this is just a sucrose gradient fractionation, showing that FORCP RNA associates with fractions in the middle of the gradient. FORCP could be polysome associated, or it could be associated with some other EDTA-sensitive complex. Given the weakness of these data, and the authors' inability to perform the appropriate analysis due to the pandemic, I suggest that these data be removed. There are sufficient other data to show that FORCP encodes a protein without this experiment.</p></disp-quote><p>We thank the reviewers for this comment and have removed the polysome data from the paper.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>2) The images in Figure 3C, which show endogenous FORCP protein, do not very convincingly show co-localization with PDI (there is clearly some co-localization, but the FORCP distribution appears to be broader). Quantification of co-localization in a larger number of cells should be provided.</p></disp-quote><p>We agree and have added the quantification of co-localization for FORCP and PDI in the revised Figure 3C.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>3) The inclusion of additional, more physiological stressors in the experiments described in Figure 4 is a positive development. However, the use of CoCl<sub>2</sub> in lieu of &quot;true hypoxia&quot; (i.e., elicited by use of an environmental hypoxia chamber), is problematic. CoCl<sub>2</sub> &quot;mimics hypoxia&quot; only as far as induction of HIF-1a or HIF-2a is concerned, via inhibition of the activity of prolyl-hydroxylases and post-translational stabilization of those proteins. Induction of ER stress and the UPR by hypoxia depends on actual reduction in intracellular O<sub>2</sub> levels leading to accumulation of unfolded proteins. Therefore, Figure 4—figure supplement 3C should be removed and only the low glucose data be shown. A more detailed analysis on the role of FORCP in cell survival under hypoxia should be re-examined in more detail later.</p></disp-quote><p>We agree and have removed this data.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>4) The authors describe a proteomic study that identifies a protein associated with ER stress, BRI3BP. At the very least, presenting the IP-western indicating a functional interaction would provide some hint as to the mechanism whereby FORCP functions in ER stress; the authors would only have to present the proteomics and interaction and could save the remaining new data for a more comprehensive functional study.</p></disp-quote><p>We agree with the reviewers’ comment. The new data has been added in revised Figure 4, Figure 4—figure supplement 4 and in Supplementary file 4. Briefly, we have included the names of all proteins that were enriched in the FORCP-FLAG pulldowns (N=4) followed by mass spectrometry (Supplementary file 4). A shorter list after removing potential false positives using CRAPOME is provided in Figure 4G. As suggested, we have validated the interaction between FORCP and BRI3BP by IP-Western (Figure 4H). Finally, we show that like FORCP, BRI3BP has a role in regulating apoptosis in response to ER stress (Figure 4I). These results provide hint to the mechanism by which FORCP functions during ER stress.</p></body></sub-article></article>
