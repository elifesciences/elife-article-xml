Cyclic di-GMP (CDG) is a promising mucosal vaccine adjuvant. However, its in vivo mechanisms are unclear. Here, we showed, in mice, that CDG elicits stronger Ab and T<sub>H</sub> responses than the mammalian 2′3′-cyclic GMP-AMP (cGAMP), and generated better protection against <italic>Streptococcus pneumoniae</italic> infection than 2′3′-cGAMP adjuvanted vaccine. We identified two in vivo mechanisms of CDG. First, intranasally administered CDG greatly enhances Ag uptake, including pinocytosis and receptor-mediated endocytosis in vivo. The enhancement depends on MPYS (STING, MITA) expression in CD11C<sup>+</sup> cells. Second, we found that CDG selectively activated pinocytosis-efficient-DCs, leading to T<sub>H</sub> polarizing cytokines IL-12p70, IFNγ, IL-5, IL-13, IL-23, and IL-6 production in vivo. Notably, CDG induces IFNλ, but not IFNβ, in vivo. Our study revealed previously unrecognized in vivo functions of MPYS and advanced our understanding of CDG as a mucosal vaccine adjuvant.</p><p><bold>DOI:</bold> <ext-link ext-link-type="doi" xlink:href="10.7554/eLife.06670.001">http://dx.doi.org/10.7554/eLife.06670.001</ext-link></p></abstract><abstract abstract-type="executive-summary"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.06670.002</object-id><title>eLife digest</title><p>The presence of a bacterium, virus, or other pathogen in the body generally triggers a response by the body's immune system. As well as trying to destroy the infectious agent, the immune system will also generate ‘memory cells’ that are primed and ready to recognize and help eliminate the pathogen if it is ever re-encountered. The parts of the invader that the memory cells recognize are called antigens.</p><p>A vaccine is a biological preparation that improves immunity to a particular disease. Vaccines normally contain a dead or weakened version of a pathogen, or its toxins or surface proteins. This exposes the immune system to the antigens in a harmless way, and creates memory cells that are able to fight off the harmful pathogen in the future before the individual becomes ill from the infection. Substances called adjuvants must also be added to many modern vaccines. Adjuvants help to present antigens to immune cells, and by doing so stimulate a stronger and more targeted immune response.</p><p>While many vaccines are currently injected, there is growing interest in developing and improving vaccines that can be inhaled. This delivers the vaccine directly to the mucosal surfaces that line the nose and lungs, which is a more effective way to produce immunity against certain bacteria and viruses. As these mucosal vaccines are also relatively cheap and easy to apply, they would also be suitable for use in developing countries and during emergencies.</p><p>Current licensed pneumococcal vaccines do not provide strong mucosal protection against the infection. As a result, pneumococcal diseases kill more people than all vaccine-preventable diseases combined. Developing safe and effective mucosal vaccine adjuvants is key to reducing the impact of pneumococcal diseases.</p><p>Cyclic di-GMP, a molecule found primarily in bacteria, is a powerful mucosal adjuvant. However, before it can be widely used in vaccines, it first needs to be known how cyclic di-GMP stimulates the immune system.</p><p>Blaauboer, Mansouri et al. studied the immune response of mice to cyclic di-GMP applied through the nose. This revealed two ways that cyclic di-GMP enhances the body's immune response to a vaccine. First, cyclic di-GMP improves the uptake of antigens by certain cells exposed to the vaccine, a process that ensures a large number of cells will alert the immune system to the perceived threat. Second, Blaauboer, Mansouri et al. explain that cyclic di-GMP selectively activates immune cells known as dendritic cells, which then produce proteins called cytokines that signal to other cells and coordinate the immune response. A gene called STING (stimulator of interferon genes) controls both cyclic di-GMP induced antigen uptake and the activation of dendritic cells. Further research into these processes is now needed to investigate whether cyclic di-GMP is a suitable mucosal pneumococcal vaccine adjuvant for humans.</p><p><bold>DOI:</bold> <ext-link ext-link-type="doi" xlink:href="10.7554/eLife.06670.002">http://dx.doi.org/10.7554/eLife.06670.002</ext-link></p></abstract><kwd-group kwd-group-type="author-keywords"><title>Author keywords</title><kwd>mucosal adjuvant</kwd><kwd>STING</kwd><kwd>dendritic cell</kwd><kwd>pneumococcal vaccine</kwd><kwd>lung</kwd></kwd-group><kwd-group kwd-group-type="research-organism"><title>Research organism</title><kwd>Mouse</kwd></kwd-group><funding-group><award-group id="par-1"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000060</institution-id><institution>National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases (NIAID)</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>1R56AI110606-01</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Jin</surname><given-names>Lei</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="par-2"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000060</institution-id><institution>National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases (NIAID)</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>1R01AI110606-01A1</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Jin</surname><given-names>Lei</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="par-3"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution>Albany Medical College</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>New Faculty Start-up Fund</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Jin</surname><given-names>Lei</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><funding-statement>The funders had no role in study design, data collection and interpretation, or the decision to submit the work for publication.</funding-statement></funding-group><custom-meta-group><custom-meta><meta-name>elife-xml-version</meta-name><meta-value>2.3</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta specific-use="meta-only"><meta-name>Author impact statement</meta-name><meta-value>In mice, cyclic di-GMP is an effective mucosal pneumococcal vaccine adjuvant that stimulates the immune response via two distinct mechanisms.</meta-value></custom-meta></custom-meta-group></article-meta></front><body><sec id="s1" sec-type="intro"><title>Introduction</title><p>Most pathogens enter the body via mucosal surfaces. Immunization by mucosal routes is more effective at inducing protective immunity against mucosal pathogens than systemic immunization. Moreover, mucosal vaccines have the benefits of low cost and ease of administration, which make mucosal vaccines particularly suitable for developing countries and during emergency. Currently, only a dozen mucosal vaccines are approved for human use. This is largely due to problems with developing safe and effective mucosal adjuvants.</p><p>Cyclic di-GMP (CDG) is a promising mucosal vaccine adjuvant candidate (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Ogunniyi et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Hu et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Chen et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Madhun et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Gray et al., 2012</xref>). It is ubiquitously found in bacteria, but is absent in higher eukaryotes. Yan et al. found that intranasal administration of CDG, along with the pneumococcal Ag PsaA, elicits a comparable Ag-specific Ab response, and reduces bacterial colonization to those mice immunized with cholera toxin and PsaA (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">Yan et al., 2009</xref>). Cholera toxin is the most potent experimental mucosal adjuvant. CDG also exhibits balanced T<sub>H</sub>1, T<sub>H</sub>2, and T<sub>H</sub>17 immune responses (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Ebensen et al., 2007</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Gray et al., 2012</xref>). A recent study found that CDG is a more potent activator of both T<sub>H</sub>1 and T<sub>H</sub>2 immune responses than LPS, CpG oligonucleotides (ODN), and aluminum salt based adjuvant in mice (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Gray et al., 2012</xref>). Thus, CDG is an excellent mucosal vaccine adjuvant candidate promoting both strong humoral and cellular immune responses.</p><p>The mechanism by which CDG acts as a mucosal adjuvant in vivo is not known (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Chen et al., 2010</xref>). We previously showed that MPYS-deficient mice (<italic>Tmem173</italic><sup><italic>−/−</italic></sup>) completely lost CDG induced Ag-specific Ab and T<sub>H</sub> responses (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Blaauboer et al., 2014</xref>). MPYS, also known as STING, MITA, and TMEM173, is a type I IFN stimulator (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Ishikawa and Barber, 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Jin et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib42">Zhong et al., 2008</xref>). However, we found that type I IFN signaling is not required for the mucosal adjuvant activity of CDG in vivo (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Blaauboer et al., 2014</xref>). CDG activates both type I IFN and NF-κB signaling (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">McWhirter et al., 2009</xref>). While MPYS is required for both CDG induced type I IFN and NF-κB activations (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Jin et al., 2011a</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">Sauer et al., 2011</xref>), we found that these two pathways can be uncoupled in dendritic cells (DCs) and macrophages (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Blaauboer et al., 2014</xref>). Of note, it is still unknown which cell type responds to mucosal adjuvant CDG in vivo.</p><p>In this study, we investigated how CDG promotes its mucosal adjuvant activity in vivo. We found that CDG enhances Ag uptake in vivo, and selectively activates pinocytosis-efficient DCs in vivo. Furthermore, we demonstrated that these CDG activities depend on the expression of MPYS in DCs in vivo.</p></sec><sec id="s2" sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><sec id="s2-1"><title>CDG is a better mucosal pneumococcal vaccine adjuvant than the mammalian cyclic dinucleotide 2′3′-cyclic GMP-AMP in mice</title><p>CDG is a potent mucosal vaccine adjuvant with activity similar to that of cholera toxin, the gold standard of a mucosal vaccine adjuvant (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">Yan et al., 2009</xref>). The 2′3′-cyclic GMP-AMP (cGAMP) is a newly discovered mammalian cyclic dinucleotide that also has mucosal adjuvant activity in vivo (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">Skrnjug et al., 2014</xref>). Both CDG and 2′3′-cGAMP can bind MPYS in vitro (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Burdette et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Gao et al., 2013a</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">Sun et al., 2013</xref>). The 2′3′-cGAMP has a much better binding affinity to MPYS than CDG (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Gao et al., 2013c</xref>). Furthermore, 2′3′-cGAMP induces stronger type I IFN production than CDG does in mammalian cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Gao et al., 2013c</xref>). We, thus, asked if the 2′3′-cGAMP exhibits superior mucosal adjuvant activity to CDG in vivo.</p><p>We intranasally administered BALB/C mice with CDG plus OVA Ag, or 2′3′-cGAMP, plus OVA Ag three times at 2 weeks interval.

We next performed the ex vivo recall assay in splenocytes from immunized mice, and examined the T<sub>H</sub> cytokine production. Again, CDG adjuvanted vaccine generated better IL-13, a T<sub>H</sub>2 cytokine, and IL-17 production than the 2′3′-cGAMP adjuvanted vaccine (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1B</xref>). The T<sub>H</sub>1 cytokine, IFNγ, was similarly produced by both cyclic dinucleotides (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1B</xref>).</p><p>We then replaced OVA Ag with pneumococcal surface protein A (PspA), a protein Ag extensively tested in various pneumococcal vaccines (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Feldman and Anderson, 2014</xref>).

We found that CDG adjuvanted PspA based pneumococcal vaccine generated higher titers of PspA-specific IgG1 and nasal IgA (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1C</xref>). Additionally, they had stronger IL-13 (T<sub>H</sub>2) and IL-17 (T<sub>H</sub>17) responses in the ex vivo recall assay than the 2′3′-cGAMP adjuvanted pneumococcal vaccine (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1D</xref>).

We concluded that, in mice, CDG, as a mucosal adjuvant, generated better Ag-specific Ab production as well as stronger T<sub>H</sub> responses than the mammalian cyclic dinucleotide 2′3′-cGAMP.

First, CDG enhances Ag uptake in APCs and non-APCs in vivo. Second, CDG activates pinocytosis-efficient cells in vivo. CDG has two phosphate groups preventing it from directly passing through the cell membrane. The mammalian receptor for CDG, MPYS, is located inside cells. Thus, though intranasally administered CDG enhances Ag uptake in all types of cells, only cells that efficiently take up CDG, via pinocytosis, will be activated (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig10">Figure 10A</xref>).<fig id="fig10" position="float"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.06670.015</object-id><label>Figure 10.</label><caption><title>In vivo mechanisms of the mucosal vaccine adjuvant CDG.</title><p>(<bold>A</bold>) The formula of CDG. Red arrows indicate the phosphate groups that prevent CDG from directly crossing the cell membrane. (<bold>B</bold>) Mechanism I: CDG enhances Ag uptakes in APCs and non-APCs. Among OVA647<sup>+</sup>APCs, only a portion of MHC II<sup>hi</sup>CD11C<sup>+</sup> (DCs) and MHC II<sup>int</sup> CD11C<sup>−</sup> cells up-regulate CD86 expression in vivo. They are mainly OVA647<sup>low</sup> cells, which take up Ag by pinocytosis. The activation of these cells generate a cytokine milieu that acts on other cells leading to enhanced Ag uptake (OVA647<sup>hi</sup> cells) but not cell activation. CDG also activates lung epithelial cells (LEC), leading to TSLP and IL-33 production. But this is only partially dependent on MPYS and is not sufficient to enhance Ag uptake in vivo (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8">Figure 8</xref>). (<bold>C</bold>) Mechanism II: CDG selectively activates pinocytosis-efficient DCs in vivo. After administering DQ-OVA together with CDG, the DQ<sup>+</sup>MHC II<sup>hi</sup>CD11C<sup>+</sup> Ag-loading DCs can be separated into two distinct populations: DQ-Green<sup>+</sup>DQ-Red<sup>−</sup>CD86<sup>+</sup> and DQ-Green<sup>+</sup>DQ-Red<sup>+</sup>CD86<sup>−</sup>. DQ-Green<sup>+</sup>DQ-Red<sup>−</sup> cells are OVA-647<sup>low</sup> cells, while DQ-Green<sup>+</sup>DQ-Red<sup>+</sup> cells are OVA-647<sup>hi</sup> cells. Only the DQ-Green<sup>+</sup>DQ-Red<sup>−</sup>CD86<sup>+</sup> cells migrated to lung DLNs.</p><p><bold>DOI:</bold> <ext-link ext-link-type="doi" xlink:href="10.7554/eLife.06670.015">http://dx.doi.org/10.7554/eLife.06670.015</ext-link></p></caption><graphic xlink:href="elife-06670-fig10-v2.tif"/></fig></p><p>How does CDG, as a mucosal adjuvant, enhance Ag uptake in vivo? Three observations in this study may shed light on the mechanism. First, CDG enhances Ag uptake by both pinocytosis and receptor mediated endocytosis (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4</xref>); Second, while CDG enhances Ag uptake in all types of cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4</xref>), deletion of MPYS in only CD11C<sup>+</sup> cells severely impaired that (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8">Figure 8</xref>); Third, MPYS expression in CD11C<sup>+</sup> cells is mainly responsible for the CDG induced cytokine milieu in lungs (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8">Figure 8</xref>). We propose that CDG enhances MPYS-dependent Ag uptake in cells directly taking up CDG (pinocytosis-efficient, OVA-647<sup>Low</sup>, DQ-Green<sup>+</sup>DQ-Red<sup>−</sup> cells). In cells that do not take up CDG (OVA-647<sup>hi</sup>, DQ-Green<sup>+</sup>DQ-Red<sup>+</sup> cells), Ag uptake is enhanced by the cytokine milieu generated mainly by CDG activated CD11C<sup>+</sup> cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig10">Figure 10B</xref>).</p><p>We favored the hypothesis that intranasally administered CDG directly primed pulmonary DCs, leading to MPYS-dependent production of T<sub>H</sub> polarizing cytokines in vivo (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig10">Figure 10C</xref>). Two pieces of data support this hypothesis. First, we detected IL-12 and IFNγ producing DCs in vivo as early as 5 hr post treatment (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3F,G</xref>). Second, the <italic>Itgax</italic><sup><italic>Cre</italic></sup><italic>Tmem173</italic><sup><italic>Flox/Flox</italic></sup> mice had dramatically decreased CDG-induced T<sub>H</sub>1 and T<sub>H</sub>17 cytokine in vivo (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8">Figure 8F,H</xref>). There are two CD11C<sup>+</sup> populations in the lung: MHC II<sup>hi</sup> and MHC II<sup>low</sup>. Among Ag positive (OVA-647<sup>+</sup>) cells, only the MHC II<sup>hi</sup>CD11C<sup>+</sup> population (i.e., DCs) were activated by CDG in vivo (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4E</xref>). This suggested that the deletion of MPYS in MHC II<sup>hi</sup>CD11C<sup>+</sup> cells (DCs) was responsible for the impaired T<sub>H</sub>1 and T<sub>H</sub>17 polarizing cytokine production in vivo.</p><p>Intriguingly, the production of T<sub>H</sub>2 polarizing cytokines IL-5 and IL-13 was less dependent on the expression of MPYS in DCs (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8">Figure 8G</xref>). Indeed, unlike <italic>Tmem173</italic><sup><italic>−/−</italic></sup> mice, <italic>Itgax</italic><sup><italic>Cre</italic></sup><italic>Tmem173</italic><sup><italic>Flox/Flox</italic></sup> mice still have some Ab and T<sub>H</sub> responses after CDG immunization (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig9">Figure 9</xref>). Therefore besides DCs, MPYS expression in other cells contributes to the adjuvant activity of CDG in vivo. We found that the OVA-647<sup>+</sup>CD11C<sup>−</sup>MHC II<sup>int</sup> APC was activated by CDG in vivo (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4E</xref>). The total number of OVA-647<sup>+</sup> activated cells in this CD11C<sup>−</sup>MHC II<sup>int</sup> population are comparable to that of the CD11C<sup>+</sup> MHC II<sup>hi</sup> population (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4G</xref>). Thus, these CD11C<sup>−</sup> OVA-647<sup>+</sup> MHC II<sup>int</sup> CD86<sup>+</sup> cells may contribute to the adjuvant activity of CDG in <italic>Itgax</italic><sup><italic>Cre</italic></sup><italic>Tmem173</italic><sup><italic>Flox/Flox</italic></sup> mice.</p><p>How does CDG enhance MPYS-mediated Ag uptake in pinocytosis-efficient cells in vivo? CDG activates MPYS-TBK1-IRF3-Type I IFN signaling in vitro. However, intranasally administered CDG did not induce Type I IFN production in vivo. Instead, it generates type II, type III IFN, and various cytokines that depend on NF-κB activation. We previously showed, in vitro, that CDG induced type I IFN and NF-κB activation can be uncoupled in DCs and macrophages (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Blaauboer et al., 2014</xref>). Thus, MPYS is not just a type I IFN stimulator. New molecular mechanisms by which CDG enhances MPYS-dependent Ag uptakes as well as activation of Type II, III IFN and NF-κB signaling in pinocytosis-efficient cells in vivo remains to be discovered.</p><p><italic>Tmem173</italic><sup><italic>−/−</italic></sup> mice still made several cytokines, namely IL-1α, IL-1β, IL-6, IL-10, IL-33, and TSLP, after CDG treatment in vivo. This indicates that CDG can activate MPYS-independent signaling in vivo. A previous study showed that CDG activated NLRP3 inflammasome independent of STING/MPYS (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Abdul-Sater et al., 2013</xref>). CDG also bound to hyperpolarization-activated cyclic nucleotide-gated channel 4 (HCN4) and inhibited cAMP regulated heart rate (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Lolicato et al., 2014</xref>). Very recently, it was found that cyclic di-AMP, a similar cyclic dinucleotide for STING/MPYS, induces human monocyte apoptosis independent of STING/MPYS (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">Tosolini et al., 2015</xref>). Thus, other mammalian receptors for CDG exist.</p><p>We showed that CDG is a superior mucosal pneumococcal vaccine adjuvant than the 2′3′-cGAMP in mice (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1</xref>). As a mammalian cyclic dinucleotide, 2′3′-cGAMP can be hydrolyzed by the ecto-nucleotide phosphodiesterase (ENPP1) found in mammalian cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Li et al., 2014</xref>). On the contrary, as a bacterial cyclic dinucleotide, CDG may be more resistant to hydrolysis when introduced into mammalian cells. Further study is needed to determine if CDG is a better human adjuvant than 2′3′-cGAMP.</p><p>The anti-tumor molecules 10-carboxymethyl-9-acridanone (CMA) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Cavlar et al., 2013</xref>) and 5,6-dimethylxanthenone-4-acetic acid (DMXAA) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Conlon et al., 2013</xref>) activate mouse, but not, human MPYS signaling. CDG, on the other hand, is functional in human cells as well (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Karaolis et al., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">Yi et al., 2013</xref>). In fact, CDG binds to mouse MPYS/STING (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Burdette et al., 2011</xref>) and human MPYS/STING (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Ouyang et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">Shang et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Shu et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib40">Yin et al., 2012</xref>) with similar dissociation constant (K<sub>d</sub>: 2–5 μM). Nevertheless, we first discovered that human TMEM173 gene displays great heterogeneity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Jin et al., 2011b</xref>). We further identified a loss-of-function human TMEM173 variant HAQ (R71H-G230A-R293Q) that is carried by ∼20% of Americans (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Jin et al., 2011b</xref>). In vitro studies demonstrated that many of these human TMEM173 variants are functionally different from the R232 (wild type) TMEM173 allele (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Ablasser et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Gao et al., 2013b</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">Yi et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib41">Zhang et al., 2013</xref>). To develop CDG or other cyclic dinucleotide as a human mucosal vaccine adjuvant, it becomes critical to determine if the adjuvant activity of cyclic dinucleotides is influenced by human TMEM173 variations in vivo.</p><p>In summary, we found that CDG enhances Ag uptake and selectively activates pinocytosis-efficient cells in vivo.

Your article has been favorably evaluated by Tadatsugu Taniguchi (Senior editor), a Reviewing editor, and two reviewers.</p><p>The Reviewing editor and the reviewers discussed their comments before we reached this decision, and the Reviewing editor has assembled the following comments to help you prepare a revised submission.</p><p>This is a very comprehensive and thorough study of mucosal responses to cyclic-di-GMP, a potent vaccine adjuvant. The ability of cyclic-di-GMP and related cyclic-di nucleotides to bind and activate STING, an ER membrane protein involved in type I IFN responses is well appreciated. Most of the work to date however in this area has focused on the mechanism of action of cyclic-di GMP and STING signaling in cells in culture. This study explores the in vivo mucosal adjuvant activity of cyclic-di GMP and the underlying mechanisms involved. In an elegant series of experiments the authors compare cyclic-di-GMP with cyclic GMP-AMP (cGAMP) an endogenous second messenger also known to bind STING. The authors provide evidence for the superior adjuvant activity of the bacterial ci-di-nucleotide over cGAMP. Moreoever, they provide evidence that cyclic di-GMP promotes its adjuvant activity in vivo by enhancing Ag uptake and via its ability to mobilize mucosal DCs in vivo, to promote its adjuvant effects. The authors generated CD11c-specific deletion of STING and uncover DC intrinsic roles for STING in mediating the adjuvant activities observed. Several really interesting aspects come out of these studies. Firstly, the authors convincingly demonstrate that the effects of cyclic-di-GMP are independent of type I IFN, but rather involve type II and type III IFNs. Secondly, their studies indicate that some in vivo effects of cyclic-di-GMP proceed independently of STING. These latter observations indicate that there are likely additional cyclic-di-GMP receptors important in vivo.</p><p>Specific comments:</p><p>1) STING-dependency is shown only for immune correlates (for example; cytokines, antigen uptake, etc). Whether actual immunity to a pathogen (after immunization with CDN adjuvants) requires STING has not been tested in this study. It would therefore be interesting to challenge STING-deficient mice (both germline knockout and conditional CD11c-Cre) with <italic>S.pneumoniae</italic> following PspA+c-di-GMP vaccination (as done in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1E</xref> with WT mice). The STING is indeed crucial to successful vaccination with CDNs, pathogen burden in STING knockouts should be similar to that seen in WT mice vaccinated with non-adjuvanted PspA. This experiment is important, as it would implicate STING in the actual outcome/effectiveness of CDN vaccination rather than in immune correlates of the immunization.</p><p>2) The observation that the responsiveness of STING for CDNs varies between species raises some concern. C-di-GMP (the CDN used in this study) is far more potent in mouse cells in vitro compared to human cells (for example, Cavlar et al., EMBO J 2013, PMID 23604073, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4</xref>). Therefore, whether c-di-GMP is superior to cGAMP as an adjuvant in humans is questionable. It is important that the authors discuss this point and amend the Abstract and other parts of the text to make it clear that c-di-GMP elicits stronger responses than cGAMP <italic>in mice</italic>. It is also noteworthy that different STING alleles found in humans encode proteins responding differentially to cGAMP isoforms (for example, Gao et al., Cell 2013, PMID 23910378).</p><p>Minor comments:</p><p>1) <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4A</xref>: To help those readers who are unfamiliar with the DQ-OVA<sup>+</sup>OVA647 assay, could the authors include a cartoon of how these compounds work here?</p><p>2) <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8">Figure 8F-J</xref>: Have the authors measured epithelial cell derived cytokines (as in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3</xref>)?

C-di-GMP (the CDN used in this study) is far more potent in mouse cells in vitro compared to human cells (for example, Cavlar et al., EMBO J 2013, PMID 23604073,</italic> <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4"><italic>Figure 4</italic></xref><italic>). Therefore, whether c-di-GMP is superior to cGAMP as an adjuvant in humans is questionable. It is important that the authors discuss this point and amend the Abstract and other parts of the text to make it clear that c-di-GMP elicits stronger responses than cGAMP</italic> in mice<italic>. It is also noteworthy that different STING alleles found in humans encode proteins responding differentially to cGAMP isoforms (for example, Gao et al., Cell 2013, PMID 23910378)</italic>.</p><p>We have amended the manuscript to emphasize that our observation was made in mice.
