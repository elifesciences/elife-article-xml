imaging on monkey and mice brains to examine the organisation of fibre pathways in white matter across anatomical scales. We compared the structure in the corpus callosum and crossing fibre regions and investigated the differences in cuprizone-induced demyelination in mouse brains versus healthy controls. Our findings revealed common principles of fibre organisation that apply despite the varying patterns observed across species; small axonal fasciculi and major bundles formed laminar structures with varying angles, according to the characteristics of major pathways. Fasciculi exhibited non-straight paths around obstacles like blood vessels, comparable across the samples of varying fibre complexity and demyelination. Quantifications of fibre orientation distributions were consistent across anatomical length scales and modalities, whereas tissue anisotropy had a more complex relationship, both dependent on the field-of-view. Our study emphasises the need to balance field-of-view and voxel size when characterising white matter features across length scales.</p></abstract><kwd-group kwd-group-type="author-keywords"><kwd>Mouse</kwd><kwd>vervet monkey</kwd><kwd>3D imaging</kwd><kwd>structure tensor</kwd><kwd>white matter</kwd><kwd>tractography</kwd></kwd-group><kwd-group kwd-group-type="research-organism"><title>Research organism</title><kwd>Mouse</kwd></kwd-group><funding-group><award-group id="fund1"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution>Captital Region of Denmark Research Foundation</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>A5657</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Kjer</surname><given-names>Hans Martin</given-names></name><name><surname>Andersson</surname><given-names>Mariam</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund2"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100000781</institution-id><institution>European Research Council</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>101044180</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Dyrby</surname><given-names>Tim B</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund3"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100003554</institution-id><institution>Lundbeck Foundation</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>R118-A11472</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Illes</surname><given-names>Zsolt</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund4"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution>Independent Research Fund Denmark</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>9039-00370B</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Illes</surname><given-names>Zsolt</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund5"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100008361</institution-id><institution>Scleroseforeningen</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>A41354</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Illes</surname><given-names>Zsolt</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund6"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100003554</institution-id><institution>Lundbeck Foundation</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>R347-2020-2454</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Elkjær</surname><given-names>Maria Louise</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><funding-statement>The funders had no role in study design, data collection and interpretation, or the decision to submit the work for publication.</funding-statement></funding-group><custom-meta-group><custom-meta specific-use="meta-only"><meta-name>Author impact statement</meta-name><meta-value>Common principles of white matter microstructure and pathway organisation was revealed using diffusion MRI and x-ray synchrotron imaging across resolutions, and employing diffusion tensor, micro-tensor, multi-fiber, and structure tensor models.</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta specific-use="meta-only"><meta-name>publishing-route</meta-name><meta-value>prc</meta-value></custom-meta></custom-meta-group></article-meta></front><body><sec id="s1" sec-type="intro"><title>Introduction</title><p>The connectome is the map of axonal connections between different brain regions. Mapping of the connectome across several anatomical length scales can unravel its hierarchical organisation, which bears a close association with normal brain function and with disruptions in disease states. The major white matter pathways can be outlined at millimetre image resolution, e.g., through photographic microdissection or tractography on diffusion magnetic resonance imaging (dMRI) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib53">Schilling et al., 2021</xref>). They include the association, projection, and interhemispheric pathways, which are further categorised into functionally related tracts such as the pyramidal tract and the inferior fronto occipital fasciculus. At millimetre resolution, the white matter tracts appear to form a structural backbone, but examination at higher resolution shows a particular topological and spatial organisation of the axonal fasciculi within (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib50">Sarubbo et al., 2019</xref>). A fasciculus is a bundle of axons that travel together over short or long distances. Its size and shape can vary depending on its internal organisation and its relationship to neighbouring fasciculi. The pyramidal tract, for example, has a topological organisation into parallel fasciculi determined by the homunculus organisation of the primary motor cortex. Hence, diseases such as amyotrophic lateral sclerosis that over time result in the loss of different types of motor control, correlate in the pyramidal tract with a topological dependent axonal degeneration (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib48">Sach et al., 2004</xref>).</p><p>The conventional model of white matter (WM) architecture has assumed a parallel within-tract topological organisation of fibres. Based on MRI tractography, Van Weeden proposed a sheet-like axonal organisation between tracts, with frequent right angle crossings (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib68">Wedeen et al., 2012</xref>), an interpretation that has been debated (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Catani et al., 2012</xref>). Indeed, the limited spatial resolution afforded by diffusion MRI calls into question the modelling accuracy of sub-voxel fibre crossings and parallel fibres (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">Maier-Hein et al., 2017</xref>). Subsequently, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib52">Schilling et al., 2017</xref> explored a potential resolution limit of crossing fibres by mapping the distribution of fibre orientations from histological images using the structure tensor model. They found that even at the scale of isotropic 32 μm, voxels still contain many crossing fibres. Despite the limited resolution of dMRI, the water diffusion process can reveal microstructural geometrical features, such as axons and cell bodies, though these features are compounded at the voxel level. Consequently, estimating microstructural characteristics depends on biophysical modelling assumptions, which can often be simplistic due to limited knowledge of the 3D morphology of cells and axons and their intermediate-level topological organisation within a voxel. Thus, complementary high-resolution imaging techniques that directly capture axon morphology and fasciculi organisation in 3D across different length scales within an MRI voxel are essential for understanding anatomy and improving the accuracy of dMRI-based models (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Alexander et al., 2019</xref>).</p><p>MicroCT from lab sources or large-scale synchrotron facilities has been demonstrated as useful for the validation of low-resolution MRI in small samples. Combining structure tensor analysis and streamlined tractography applied to the micro CT, Trinkel et al. demonstrated virtual mapping of the murine brain connectome of major pathways in comparison to tractography from diffusion MRI (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib64">Trinkle et al., 2021</xref>). In their work, they did not provide insights into the organisation of interfacing fasciculus bundles and were not able to resolve finer structures such as axons when using the resolution of MRI due to limited resolution.</p><p>X-ray holographic nanotomography (XNH) is another complementary imaging technique that enables nanoscopic image resolutions of intact axonal white matter in 3D using phase-contrast synchrotron imaging. By stacking image XNH volumes, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Andersson et al., 2020</xref> obtained an anisotropic FOV of 600 micrometres, which is of comparable scale to a typical MRI voxel. Through segmentation of the larger diameter axons, they characterised the microdispersion of their trajectories using a measure of tortuosity, thereby revealing that the cross-sectional morphological changes along individual axons are imposed by structures in the local environment, i.e., cells, vacuoles, and blood vessels (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Andersson et al., 2020</xref>). Such 3D characteristics have provided new insights that improved microstructure MRI diffusion models (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">Lee et al., 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Andersson et al., 2022</xref>). However, the Andersson study provided no analysis of the organisational features at the scale of axon fasciculus level due to the technical difficulty of segmenting full volumes. We thus see a need for a sufficiently high-resolution imaging modality with a larger FOV for exploring and quantifying axon fasciculus organisation (especially their interfaces) in simple and complex white matter regions. In this regard, Mortazavi et al., combined a neuronal tracer with structure tensor analysis applied to histological images to show that labelled axons of the major white matter pathways in the <italic>centrum semiovale</italic> cross each other in a grid-pattern (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib42">Mortazavi et al., 2018</xref>). Moreover, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib69">Zhou et al., 2013</xref> combined two different fluorescence neuronal tracers to show vertical stacking of parallel interhemispheric projections in the corpus callosum of mice. However, such approaches capture only a small number of labelled axons.</p><p>Recent advances in synchrotron imaging introduced hierarchical phase-contrast CT of the intact human brain, with a selection of different FOVs and image resolution (down to 2.5 μm) within a single imaging session (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib67">Walsh et al., 2021</xref>). Ideally, sub-micrometre imaging techniques are needed to be comparable to the microstructural features that diffusion MRI is sensitive to.</p><p>In this work, we applied a multimodal imaging approach, aiming to bridge the gap between diffusion MRI and the scale of the axonal fasciculi, aiming to reveal the 3D white matter organisation across different anatomical length scales throughout intact monkey and mouse brains, and in a murine demyelination model. We study two white matter regions of differing organisational complexity: The relatively simple and homogenous <italic>corpus callosum</italic> (CC), and second a complex crossing fibre region in the <italic>centrum semiovale</italic> (CS). We use the term ‘anatomical length scales’ throughout to designate anatomical features of different magnitudes – axons, bundles of axons (fasciculi), and tracts – that may have differing scales between mouse and monkey brains. To perform this multi-scale investigation, we apply a multi-modal imaging approach combining conventional diffusion MRI with sub-micron x-ray synchrotron phase-contrast tomography at two different synchrotron facilities: the Deutsches Elektronen-Synchrotron (DESY), beamline P10; and the European Synchrotron (ESRF), beamline ID16A. After diffusion MRI, we imaged volumes of interest at DESY (550 nm voxel size) and then at ESRF (75–100 nm voxel sizes). Each step produced images with increasing resolution, but in incrementally smaller FOVs. From the diffusion MRI data, we estimated tissue anisotropy using the diffusion tensor model (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Basser et al., 1994</xref>) and micro-tensor model (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Kaden et al., 2016</xref>). Additionally, we modelled the fibre orientation distribution (FOD) with the multi-fibre constrained spherical deconvolution (CSD) model (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib62">Tournier et al., 2007</xref>). In the x-ray synchrotron data, we applied a scale-space structure tensor analysis, which allowed for the quantification of structure tensor-derived tissue anisotropy and FOD in the same anatomical regime indirectly detected by dMRI. Additionally, we performed tractography on the main (or dominant) direction obtained from the structure tensor, and modelled axonal fasciculi based on the clustering of the tractography streamlines, with quantification of their deviations from linearity, i.e., tortuosity. Through these methods, we demonstrated organisational principles of white matter that persist across anatomical length scales and species. These principles govern the organisation of axonal fasciculi into sheet-like laminar shapes (structures with a predominant planar arrangement). Interestingly, while these principles remain consistent, they result in varied structural organisations in different species. We found that these laminae have differing inclination angles with respect to each other, depending on their presence within parallel or crossing major pathways. Furthermore, using a mouse model of focal demyelination induced by cuprizone (CPZ) treatment, we investigate the inflammation-related influence on axonal organisation. This is achieved through the same structure tensor-derived micro-anisotropy and tractography streamline metrics.</p></sec><sec id="s2" sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><sec id="s2-1"><title>Multi-scale, multi-modal imaging data in the monkey CC</title><p>We first acquired an ex vivo diffusion MRI image of the whole monkey brain, which was reconstructed with isotropic 0.5×0.5×0.5 mm<sup>3</sup> voxel sizes (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1A</xref>) (see Methods section for details).

The structure tensor directional colouring (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3B</xref>) does not clearly capture the layered laminar organisation seen in the DESY data.

An exact co-registration of the two synchrotron volumes was not feasible, and some discrepancies between the FODs are to be expected. The spread and shape of the FODs are quantified using the Orientation Dispersion Index (ODI) and Dispersion Anisotropy (DA) (see Methods section). For the DESY and ESRF samples, the ODI values are 0.038 and 0.069, respectively, while the DA values are 0.55 and 0.59. Despite the different FOVs, these values are similar. The low ODI indicates a high degree of axon alignment, as expected in the CC. The mid-level DA values suggest some anisotropic spread of the directions, reflecting the angled laminar organisation observed in the DESY sample.

As such, the streamlines in ESRF data (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5C</xref>) better reflect detailed axonal trajectory variations as compared to the DESY data. For example, streamlines in the CC show non-straight trajectories that circumvent neighbourhood obstacles such as clusters of cell bodies, other axons, and blood vessels (orange structures). Interestingly, we observed a few axon fasciculi crossing the FOV orthogonally to the otherwise dominant R-L organisation. This phenomenon was particularly evident along the blood vessels, as illustrated in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5C</xref> (red streamlines).</p><p>As expected, streamlines in the ESRF <italic>centrum semiovale</italic> data, followed the main direction of the laminae identified in the structure tensor directional map seen in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4F</xref>. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5D</xref> shows the trajectory of streamlines coloured according to the local direction, i.e., R-L (red), A-P (green) and S-I (blue). Independent of the main direction, we observe streamlines skirting around local obstacles and other axons, resulting in more complex and less straight trajectories than in the CC region.</p><p>To quantify the shape of fasciculi trajectories through the image volume, we characterised each streamline with two scalar values: (1) the streamline tortuosity index, which is a unitless score in [1, ∞] describing the deviation from linearity, and (2) the calculated maximum physical deviation from a straight line of each streamline, which depicts the maximal axonal ‘amplitude’ or dispersion. Both scalar metrics are independent of the general fasciculus orientation, but reflect micro-dispersion that can impact dMRI estimations (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib43">Nilsson et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Andersson et al., 2020</xref>). We estimated the distributions of tortuosity and maximum deviation for all streamlines in both the DESY and ESRF samples (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5B</xref>).</p><p>In the CC, the median tortuosity index of the distribution was almost identical in the DESY (1.01, IQR: 0.01) and ESRF sample (1.01, IQR: 0.01). A tortuosity index close to unity is equivalent to highly straight fibres, consistent with both the visual inspection of the streamlines (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5A and C</xref>), the estimated ODI, and likewise with our expectation for the CC. In contrast, the median observed maximum deviation within the samples differed distinctly between DESY (17.1 μm, IQR: 10.7 μm) and ESRF (2.8 μm, IQR: 3.1 μm). In ESRF data, the small FOV limits the analysis to capture only microscopic effects. Therefore, the maximum deviation is driven by the interaction of the fasciculus with neighbourhood obstacles, i.e., micro-dispersion. We observed maximum deviations as high as 12 μm, which were due to obstacles like blood vessels, thus in good agreement with observations reported in <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Andersson et al., 2020</xref>. In DESY data, deviations were as high as 40 μm, which we attribute to more macroscopic effects such as the bending of pathways, as observed in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5A</xref>.

Interestingly, the distribution of maximum deviations had a peak of around 5.3 μm and a median of 7.1 μm (IQR: 9.6 μm). While it is an increase compared to the CC, the magnitude of streamline dispersion is on a comparable scale.</p><p>We conducted three non-parametric statistical tests of significance (⍺=0.05) between the two CC samples (DESY vs. ESRF) and between the two ESRF samples (CC vs. CS).

We found sporadic directional deviations in the coronal view, represented as local regions with different directional colours in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7B</xref>, which indicate local crossing axon fasciculi and/or blood vessels. Nevertheless, the visualisation of orientations did not reveal any axonal organisation in the mouse CC due to the lack of local angular contrast, unlike the clear laminar structures seen in the monkey sample (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3A</xref>). Any parallel organisation in tissue remains undetectable because our visual contrast relies on angular differences.</p><p>The two major pathways, the CC and cingulum, appear in the mouse as two sharply separated structures, facilitating the generation of image masks for regionally independent quantifications of the structure tensor analysis. These structures cross almost orthogonally, as shown in the 3D glyphs of the structure tensor FODs from both the ESRF and DESY datasets (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7E</xref>). In all cases, the ODI was estimated to be below 0.06, indicating highly directed pathways, similar to those values measured in the monkey CC. The DA indices show more variation: In the CC, DA was 0.49 and 0.32 for the DESY and ESRF samples, respectively, and in the cingulum, 0.78 and 0.29. These values are on the same scale as those for the monkey and are non-zero, suggesting some axonal organisation is present, even though it was not visually confirmed.</p><p>The structure tensor FA histograms of the mouse CC and cingulum, are both shifted toward lower values in the DESY data as compared to the ESRF data (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7G</xref>). The two histograms overlap in the DESY data, whereas the ESRF data shows a shift towards higher FA values in the cingulum as compared to CC, indicating a dependency of the estimated FA on image resolution relative to the size of structures. From the ESRF data, we were able to roughly segment cell clusters and blood vessels. Since the volume consists of about 13.5% cells/blood vessels in the cingulum, versus only 8.5% in CC, the higher density of extra-axonal structures may factor into the differences in estimated FA values.</p><p>In the CPZ-treated mouse brain, the directional colour-coded structure tensors in the DESY data match that in the healthy mouse, even in the demyelination region, which shows reduced image contrast (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7C vs. D</xref>). The fact that there even is directional contrast in the demyelinated region, depicts the advantage of phase-contrast imaging, where the obtained contrast is not solely dependent on absorption. Note that the demyelination region is confined to axons within the CC, with sparing of the cingulum. The lower image contrast (lack of strong edges) in the demyelinated region contributes to the blurrier tensor shapes and lower FA values as compared to the normal-appearing white matter (mean FA: 0.44 vs 0.52), as shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7H</xref>. The FODs are similar (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7F</xref>) with ODI = 0.03 and 0.04 for the normal-appearing and lesioned regions respectively as expected for the highly aligned axons in CC. In the same order DA = 0.18 and 0.40.</p></sec><sec id="s2-7"><title>Axon fasciculi trajectories in healthy and demyelination mouse brains</title><p>For better comparisons, we registered the ESRF data of mouse CC onto the DESY data. In healthy and cuprizone-lesioned mice, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8">Figure 8A and B</xref> shows that the CC and cingulum are both mappable using streamlines. Irrespective of image resolution, the cingulum did have a lower tortuosity and maximal deviation than the CC (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8">Figure 8C and E</xref>), which could be due to differences in densities of extra-axonal structures. This is suggested by the streamlines projecting through the demyelinated region (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8">Figure 8B</xref>), which contains more cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6D and E</xref>). Indeed, both indices broadened with lower image resolution in combination with a larger FOV that covers macroscopic shape changes.

Importantly, our findings revealed common principles of fibre organisation in both monkeys and mice despite differences between species; small axonal fasciculi and major bundles formed sheet-like laminar structures, with relative angles that depended on the characteristics of the major pathways to which they belonged. By applying a scale-space structure tensor analysis and streamline tractography to the synchrotron datasets, we quantified the micro-dispersion of individual axons and fasciculi. Interestingly, the dispersion magnitude is indicative of fasciculi that skirt around obstacles in the white matter such as cells and blood vessels, and the results are observed across both white matter complexity (straight vs crossing fibre region) and pathology. Our dMRI and scale-space structure tensor analysis allowed us to compare and quantify tissue anisotropies and fibre orientations. We found that FODs were comparable across image resolutions and modalities. The observed discrepancies can be attributed to the fact that the FOVs are not exactly matched. Estimates of structure tensor-derived microscopic FA show a clear pattern across modalities. However, to achieve good specificity in the anatomical feature correlation the diffusion tensor and structure tensor models must be sensitive to the same anatomical length scale.</p><sec id="s3-1"><title>Laminar organisation across image resolutions and modalities</title><p>Our white matter samples from monkey and mouse brains were geometrically organised as stacked laminae across anatomical length scales extending from individual axons to axon fasciculi and the major WM pathways.</p><p>In the monkey CC DESY data, which has a field of view (FOV) comparable to a dMRI voxel, a columnar laminar organisation at a macroscopic level was visually revealed from the structure tensor (ST) direction colouring. However, this laminar organisation was not visible in the higher-resolution ESRF data for the same tissue sample. Although the two samples were not co-registered, the size of a single ESRF FOV within the DESY sample is illustrated in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3A</xref>. This demonstrates the possibility of placing the ESRF sample where the observed laminar structure is absent. Consequently, knowledge of the tissue structural organisation and its orientation is important to fully benefit from the stacked FOV of the ESRF sample and when choosing appropriate minimal FOV sizes in future experiments.</p><p>Interestingly, when characterising FODs with measures like ODI and DA as indicators of fibre organisation, rather than relying on visualisation, results from large- and small-FOV data show no discrepancies. This statistical approach discards the spatial context (visually perceived as laminae), highlighting the need to combine both methods.</p><p>Invasive tracer studies and histology in monkeys (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Caminiti et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Howard et al., 2023</xref>) and histology of humans (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib41">Mollink et al., 2017</xref>) previously hinted at a columnar organisation in the ventral part of midsagittal CC. However, the earlier approaches failed to show the finer 3D columnar organisation of 10 μm thick laminae as revealed by the present structure tensor analysis of the synchrotron data. The occurrence of these thin layers with slightly different angles may be confirmed by visual inspection of polarised light imaging (PLI) data collected in a human brain coronal CC slice (in Figure 6 of <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib41">Mollink et al., 2017</xref>). In a coronal view of the mid-sagittal region, PLI showed fibres arising from the right and left hemispheres reaching the midsagittal CC as a layered structure, based on its orientational colour coding. The greater slice thickness (in PLI 100 μm) in a coronal view may have resulted in a partial volume effect arising from the thinner non-parallel columnar laminar sheets that we observed in the sagittal view of our synchrotron data (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3A</xref>).</p><p>Structure tensor analysis of the present ESRF data in the complex fibre region clearly shows the crossing of three pathways composed of laminar sheets of fasciculi (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4E</xref>). Compared to the parallel within-tract axonal fasciculi in the monkey CC, the boundaries between fasciculi in the complex fibre region are thin (tens of micrometres), and, therefore, likely to be less well defined when visualised as streamlines. However, we did not see such an intermingling of streamlines at the interface between the crossing of the larger well-defined tracts such as the CC and cingulum in the mouse brain (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7B–D</xref>).</p></sec><sec id="s3-2"><title>The inclination angle between fasciculi</title><p>The structure tensor method performed very well in analysing the fasciculi without segmentation, through its detection of tracts and fasciculi based on their angular differences and highlighting of their sheet-like and laminar organisation. The observed tendencies regarding fasciculi organisation can be grouped into two: Within-WM pathways where inclination angles are low, including 0 degree parallel alignment, and between-WM pathways where the angles are high.</p><p>Within major WM pathways, neighbouring axonal fasciculi appeared to follow the same principal direction but could have inclination angles up to the order of 35 degrees in both species.</p><p>In the monkey CC (mid-body), we observed laminar organisation indicated by clear spatial angular differences in the ST directions in the sample (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3A</xref>). Quantifications of the FOD shape showed DA indices of 0.55 and 0.59 for the DESY and ESRF samples, respectively. In contrast, the mouse CC (splenium) did not visually reveal a similar angled laminar organisation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7C</xref>), and the DA indices were lower, at 0.49 and 0.32, respectively. Two possible explanations exist. First, the within-pathway laminar organisation may not be identical across the entire CC. Consequently, more scans from other CC regions would be required to confirm. Second, the different species might account for the differences. Larger brains like the monkeys might foster a different level of within-pathway axon organisation compared to the smaller mouse. Although we could not visually detect laminar organisation from the colour coding of the ST direction in the mouse, the non-zero DA values suggest some level of organisation. This is supported by our streamline tractography, which indicates a vertical layered organisation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8">Figure 8A and B</xref>). It further aligns with studies using histological tracer mapping that shows a stacked parallel organisation of callosal projections in mice, between cortex regions M1 and S1 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib69">Zhou et al., 2013</xref>). Nevertheless, we cannot rely solely on voxel-wise ST directions to fully describe the axonal organisation, as this method does not contrast almost parallel fasciculi (inclination angles approaching 0 degrees). Analysing patterns in tractography streamlines would be an interesting future direction for this purpose.</p><p>Interestingly, the default multi-fibre dMRI CSD model for the monkey CC showed only a single fibre direction with an isotropic FOD, indicating a coherent fibre pathway (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2C</xref>). This approach did not reveal any of the layering and organisation evident from structure tensor analysis of the synchrotron data (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3</xref>). Nevertheless, when investigating the directions of the diffusion tensor model we see signs that the diffusion signal is indeed sensitive to the complexity of fasciculi organisation; the principal direction agrees with the CSD and is locally consistent across the entire CC. However, the second and third eigenvectors are also informative, in that they behave symmetrically across the midline, and are locally consistent, although their order can shift at specific locations. This is likely an indication of the local organisation, similar to PLI-based observations (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib41">Mollink et al., 2017</xref>). Additionally, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib58">Tax et al., 2016</xref> have demonstrated the calculation of a grid-crossing sheet probability index from diffusion MRI data, which suggested the presence of sheet-like features in a crossing fibre region, which is in line with our findings in the synchrotron data. Note that the method by Tax et al. only detects sheet-like structures crossing on a grid and does not reveal laminar structures with lower inclination angles, as we observed in the monkey CC.</p><p>By further exploring the diffusion tensor modelling of the CC in the Human Connectome Data set (N=4, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="app1fig1">Appendix 1—figure 1</xref>) we found an order of the second and third eigenvectors resembling that in the dMRI of the monkey. This observation supports the future exploration of the diffusion-weighted signal to reveal insights about axonal organisation within a WM pathway. For the present, we have demonstrated axonal organisation only in selected regions of the WM, but further research may establish more generalised rules governing fasciculi organisation in WM pathways, and potential species-related differences.</p><p>Between-WM pathways, the fasciculi cross with high inclination angles approaching 90 degrees. This is readily detectable in diffusion MRI multi-fibre CSD modelling (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib61">Tournier et al., 2004</xref>) and in the structure tensor analysis. We observed this right angle crossing at the <italic>centrum semiovale</italic>, a complex fibre region with the crossing of three different pathways (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4</xref>). Using tracer labelling of axonal projections, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib42">Mortazavi et al., 2018</xref> revealed grid-like right-angle crossing of axons in a similar region in the monkey brain. Tractography and micro-dissection findings of <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib68">Wedeen et al., 2012</xref> of the same region similarly showed grid-like crossing of laminar from different pathways.</p><p>Interestingly, we observed in the ESRF data a single axonal fasciculus composed of a few axons that crossed the main callosum pathway at an almost 90 degree angle running parallel to a blood vessel (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5C</xref>). Such phenomena may be overlooked in lower resolution data and have such a small contribution to the diffusion MRI signal as to be dismissed as noise/artefact. Without prior knowledge of their existence, such crossings are apt to be disregarded by modelling choices, such as orders of spherical harmonics, model regularisation, and number of fibre populations.</p><p>Our findings of laminar organisation and the distinction between high and low inclination angles seem to support a simple topological rule across anatomical length scales. This holds especially for the low inclination cases, which retain their laminar organisation with minimal intermingling in the neighbourhood, meaning that we expect that topological organisation should be kept at a distance. If so, the (inclination angle) information might serve to form rules for low-resolution diffusion MRI-based tractography about how best to project through crossing fibre and bottleneck regions, which is currently a source of false-positives trajectories (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">Maier-Hein et al., 2017</xref>). The reason is that standard tractography methods do not ‘remember’ or follow anatomical organisation rules as they trace through complex regions. Our findings on pathway lamination and inclination angles—low for parallel-like trajectories and high for crossing-like trajectories—can help incorporate trajectory memory into these methods, reducing the risk of false trajectories.</p><p>We believe our observed topological rule of white matter laminar organisation can be explained by a biological principle known from studies of nervous tissue development. The first axons to reach their destination, guided by their growth cones, are known as ‘pioneering’ axons. ‘Follower’ axons use the shaft of the pioneering axon for guidance to efficiently reach the target region (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Breau and Trembleau, 2023</xref>). Axons can form a fasciculus by fasciculating or defasciculating along their trajectory through a zippering or unzipping mechanism, controlled by chemical, mechanical, and geometrical parameters. Zippering ‘glues’ the axons together, while unzipping allows them to defasciculate at a low angle (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib55">Šmít et al., 2017</xref>). Although speculative, the zippering mechanism may be responsible for forming the laminar topology observed across length scales. The defasciculation effect can explain our results in the corpus callosum (CC) of monkeys, with laminar structures at low angles (~35 degrees) also observed by <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Innocenti et al., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Caminiti et al., 2009</xref>, as well as in other major pathways (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib50">Sarubbo et al., 2019</xref>). In contrast, a fasciculation mechanism may be observed in the mouse CC (0 degrees). If the geometrical angle between two axons is high, i.e., toward 90 degrees, the zippering mechanism will not occur, and the two axons (fasciculi) will cross (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib55">Šmít et al., 2017</xref>). This supports our and other findings that crossing fasciculi or pathways occur at high angles toward 90 degrees in the fully matured brain (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib68">Wedeen et al., 2012</xref>). Once myelination begins, the zippering mechanism is lost (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib55">Šmít et al., 2017</xref>), suggesting that laminar topology is established at the earliest stages of brain maturation.</p></sec><sec id="s3-3"><title>Sources to the non-straight trajectories of axon fasciculi</title><p>Applying streamlined tractography to the main fibre orientations in the structure tensor analysis enabled a geometric quantification of the non-linearity of axon fasciculi trajectories as a tortuosity metric (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib46">Pingel et al., 2022</xref>). Surprisingly, we observed that the maximal amplitude of the axon fasciculi was comparable when measured in the crossing and straight fibre regions. This suggests that the geometrical variation in an axon fasciculus trajectory may hold similarly throughout the white matter.</p><p>We also detected differences in minor pathways: In the mouse brain ESRF data, axon fasciculi were straighter (i.e. having lower tortuosity) in the cingulum than those in the corpus callosum. Similarly in monkey ESRF data, fasciculi were straighter in the CC than in the crossing fibre region.</p><p>For the monkey and mouse brain samples, the distributions of maximal deviation in the ESRF and DESY data showed main peaks around 5–7 μm. This range of maximal deviation aligns with the typical radius of the cell bodies. Indeed, axons and fasciculi have been observed to skirt around oligodendrocytes in the ESRF monkey data set (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Andersson et al., 2020</xref>). In addition, the maximal deviation is in accord with the size of a single axonal fasciculi (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5C</xref>) or blood vessels.</p><p>Even in the case of regional demyelination in the cuprizone-treated mice, we saw minor changes in tortuosity compared to normal axon fasciculi (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8">Figure 8D</xref>). We suppose that microglia and macrophages invading the site of demyelination are sufficiently similar in size to oligodendrocytes that they have little net effect on the distribution of tortuosity. The measured max deviation was higher in the cuprizone-treated mouse (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8">Figure 8F</xref>), but given the magnitude of approx. 30 μm, this effect is more likely a description of the macroscopic bending of the CC, rather than a result of the demyelination. As our streamlines went through both demyelinated and normal-appearing regions of the CC, we experienced a similar dilemma found in MRI-based tractography applied in humans. The streamlines are based on only the direction of the tensor and are not guaranteed to be sensitive to local pathology. Additionally, demyelination is a dynamic process. We only sampled a single time point, and more must be included to explore if the tractography-based analysis has the sensitivity to correlate with the temporal dimension of demyelination.</p><p>Diffusion MRI is sensitive to the micro-dispersion effects (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Lee et al., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Andersson et al., 2020</xref>), but our findings suggest that the amplitude of micro-dispersion is primarily related to the sizes of extra-axonal structures independent of the complexity of the major white matter pathway. We also observe that the tortuosity can change between different white matter pathways. Assuming that the local distributions of cell bodies, vessels, and axon fasciculi can generalise within a pathway, then we can expect the micro-dispersion effects on the dMRI signal to be homogeneous.</p><p>Notably, high-resolution light-microscopy-techniques such as Polarised Light imaging with in-plane 5 μm and 30–100 μm thick slices (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Axer et al., 2011</xref>) as well as light-sheet imaging are expected to be too low in resolution to detect the micro-dispersion effects.</p></sec><sec id="s3-4"><title>Fibre orientation distributions across image resolutions depend on FOV</title><p>We found a general agreement in the FODs between the different image modalities and across image resolutions. This is in line with other studies comparing dMRI with structure tensor analysis using both single and multi-fibre models (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Khan et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Budde and Frank, 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">Leuze et al., 2021</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib51">Schilling et al., 2016</xref>).</p><p>The FOD discrepancies that we did observe could be attributed to the differences in the FOVs across the imaging modalities. As shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1</xref>, we prepared biopsy samples for synchrotron imaging that was on a sufficiently large scale to cover several MRI voxels of isotropic 500 μm size. Indeed, the DESY sample covered multiple MRI voxels, except that a relatively large unstained region in the middle of the sample was not included in the generated FOD. Similarly, the four stacked image volumes of the ESRF measuring 780 μm in length by 210 μm in diameter only covered a fraction of the DESY volume and MRI image voxel. Since the FOD is dependent upon fibre organisation, the observed FOD differences reflect actual anatomical differences, for example with more volumetric weighing in one fibre direction. Therefore, although FODs are independent of image resolution, care must be taken when comparing two modalities without covering the same 3D volume, as observed in the CC (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3E and F</xref> vs. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3H, I</xref>). Examples are validation studies comparing the FOD from diffusion MRI fibre models with that derived from 2D or 3D histology which only rarely cover the same identical volume (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Khan et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Budde and Frank, 2012</xref>). In cases of differing FOV, there may be a risk of misattributing an actual difference in anatomical information across length scales as a methodological difference.</p></sec><sec id="s3-5"><title>Tissue micro anisotropy across modalities, image resolutions, and pathology</title><p>We show that tissue anisotropy metrics are comparable across modalities but vary with the anatomical length scale. The simple FA metric in the diffusion tensor MRI model was, as expected, sensitive to the average tissue organisation/anisotropy in the voxel. Thus, we found higher anisotropy in the CC (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2C</xref>) as compared to the <italic>centrum semiovale</italic>, a more complex fibre region, much as observed by others (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Andersen et al., 2020</xref>). In contrast, the μFA dMRI metric (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Kaden et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Jespersen et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Jespersen et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">Lasič et al., 2014</xref>) is sensitive to tissue anisotropy only in micro-domains of 10 μm length scale (molecular displacement). The μFA generates a mean anisotropy value within a voxel, returning similarly high FA values in both the CC and c<italic>entrum semiovale</italic>, thereby confirming the expected independence of FA on the structural organisation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Andersen et al., 2020</xref>).</p><p>In the DESY and ESRF data, anisotropy measured by the structure tensor model is also determined within a micro-domain controlled by the patch-size and produces a distribution of values from the full volume. We introduced a scale-space parameter that automatically adjusts the patch-size to ensure optimal sensitivity to anisotropic features. Patch-sizes of 18 μm for DESY and 5 μm for ESRF data depict similarly sized micro-domains as in the μFA diffusion MR model and were shown to be largely independent of an axonal organisation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4H</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7G</xref>).</p><p>The same anatomical features, namely cell membranes and myelin, dominate the contrast of diffusion vs. structure tensor techniques. In dMRI, these structures are the main sources for restricted and hindered water diffusion, and their osmium staining for the synchrotron scans provides strong image gradients modelled by the structure tensor. However, tissue preparation differs substantially for the two image modalities. In the case of ex vivo MRI, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib56">Sun et al., 2005</xref> showed that anisotropy of perfusion fixated, hydrated tissue should closely match that in vivo. However, synchrotron imaging calls for an extra dehydration step before tissue embedding in EPON, which changes the intra- and extracellular volume fractions due to tissue shrinkage (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">Korogod et al., 2015</xref>). Similarly, there are shrinkage effects between dehydrated and hydrated synchrotron image samples (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib59">Töpperwien et al., 2019</xref>). Given the large differences in tissue processing, the obtained anisotropy measures naturally differ across the modalities. Nevertheless, as both the diffusion- and structure tensor models were sensitive to the same anatomical features, the observed strong correlation in FA values was expected.</p><p>Across image resolutions, the distributions of structure tensor anisotropy also changed, being generally lower and broader in DESY data compared to ESRF data. This could reflect greater partial volume effects in the lower-resolution DESY data, thus decreasing the apparent separation of cells and axons. Such image blurring can change the image gradient information used by the structure tensor model, thereby making the anisotropy metric dependent on the image resolution. Therefore, structure tensor quantification of anisotropy metrics calls for invariant image resolution.</p><p>In our comparison of structure tensor anisotropy in healthy mice versus cuprizone-induced demyelination, the data clearly shows a lowered anisotropy distribution in focally demyelinated regions compared with healthy WM regions (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7H</xref>). We observed an increased extra-axonal content in the lesion area, thus in agreement with the observed higher density of cells in demyelinated tissue (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">He et al., 2021</xref>). By outlining the various cellular structures in 3D, we could visualise what we believe to be cell bodies, macrophages, and the myelin debris engulfed inside macrophages (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6E</xref>).</p><p>Interestingly, despite reduced anisotropy in demyelinated regions, the structure tensor still detects a clear directionally dependent anisotropy as in the healthy brain, consistent with the persistence of axons in this animal model despite demyelination (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">He et al., 2021</xref>). We did not collect diffusion MRI for the cuprizone-lesioned brains. However, we recently reported relatively preserved μFA values in demyelinated regions of the rat CC (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">He et al., 2021</xref>). Similar findings were made in a group of multiple sclerosis patients compared to normal (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Andersen et al., 2020</xref>) supporting our synchrotron anisotropy results.</p></sec><sec id="s3-6"><title>Limitations</title><sec id="s3-6-1"><title>Sample size</title><p>Increasing the number of samples across both species and examining laminar organisation at various length scales in more regions would strengthen our findings. However, securing beamtime at two different synchrotron facilities to scan the same sample with varying image resolutions is a limiting factor. Beamline development for multi-resolution experimental setups, along with faster acquisition methods, is a rapidly advancing field. For instance, the Hierarchical Phase-Contrast Tomography (HiP-CT) imaging beamline at ID-18 at the ESRF, enables multi-resolution imaging within a single session to address this challenge, though it is currently limited to a resolution of 2.5 μm (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib67">Walsh et al., 2021</xref>).</p></sec><sec id="s3-6-2"><title>Registration</title><p>It was not possible to realise perfect correlational cell-to-cell imaging between the three very different modalities and experimental set-ups. This resulted in minor cross-modal differences between FODs, for example in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3</xref>, where we see a FOD tilt difference due to either misalignment or an anatomical difference, albeit without affecting the interpretation of quantitative measures.</p><p>MRI-to-synchrotron registration is challenging due both to the large resolution difference and different contrast mechanisms. Our best option was, therefore, to rely on prior knowledge of fibre orientations to match approximately the samples. Given that we know the site of biopsy sampling, we could confine our search to a small neighbourhood of possible/potential MRI voxels and identify the one giving the best visual match of fibre orientation.</p><p>The matching between the different synchrotron volumes was easier and achievable manually for the mouse samples, as they contained large global features in the form of both the CC and cingulum and even a little beyond. Despite our efforts, we could not obtain similar matching for the monkey samples. Due to the imaging at different beamlines, the samples had been physically moved and repositioned in a new setup, thus losing alignment. This process gradually becomes easier and more streamlined as the various synchrotron beamlines develop. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib67">Walsh et al., 2021</xref> recently succeeded in applying several zoom-ins on a low-resolution overview scan of an intact brain within the same scanning session at the ESRF BM05 beamline. This approach removes the need to collect small selective biopsy samples for the different experiments. However, the finest pixel size in Walsh et al. was isotropic 2.5 μm, which might be too coarse to perform the structure tensor analysis that we undertook to map fibre organisation across anatomical length scales to be compared with diffusion MRI.</p></sec><sec id="s3-6-3"><title>Resolution</title><p>The different imaging setups each have characteristic image resolutions and native voxel sizes, but these are not the only relevant factors in this study. The targeted anatomical features are a primary consideration. Our examination of the monkey and mouse samples at the same beamlines gave approximately the same image resolution, voxel size, and FOV size. Nevertheless, the anatomical scales are quite different simply because the mouse brain is smaller, with a brain volume ratio of approximately 1:190. Thus, the same synchrotron FOV covered only a small part of the CC in the monkey, vs. a large portion of the major callosal pathway and part of the cingulum in the mouse. When defining terminologies such as ‘high image resolution,’ it is essential to relate it to the size of the anatomical structures of interest (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Dyrby et al., 2014</xref>).</p><p>A limiting consequence of having samples imaged at differing anatomical scales is that certain measures become inherently hard to compare in a normalised way. The tractography-based metrics—tortuosity and maximum deviation—serve as good examples of this resolution and FOV dependence. In the ESRF samples, the anatomical scale was at the level of individual axons, and the streamline metrics primarily reflect micro-scale effects from the extra-axonal environment, such as the influence of cells and blood vessels. In comparison, the larger anatomical scale in the DESY samples represents the level of fasciculi and above, with metrics influenced by macroscopic effects, such as the bending of the CC pathway. Both scales are interesting and can provide valuable insights, but caution is required when comparing the numbers, especially for cross-species studies where there is a significant difference in brain volume ratios.</p><p>Within the same species, assuming perfect co-registration of samples, it would be possible to perform correlative imaging and analysis. This would allow validation of whether tractography streamlines could be reproduced at different image resolutions within the same normalised FOV. Although this was not possible with the current data and experimental setup, it would be an interesting point to pursue in future work.</p><p>Additionally, the image resolution does not determine voxel size, since acquired data of fixed resolution can be up- or down-sampled by interpolation. Indeed, interpolation does not change the image information (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Dyrby et al., 2014</xref>), while the image resolution is fundamentally defined by the ‘quality’ of the imaging setup. As summarised in <xref ref-type="table" rid="table2">Table 2</xref>, we interpolated by down sampling for ease of processing and visualisation. Nonetheless, we continue referring to the datasets according to the original reconstructed voxel size (e.g. 75 nm of the ESRF data), as this reflects the approximate inherent image resolution. We minimised the effects of interpolation on the results by specifying the parameters and converting quantities to physical distances whenever possible. Furthermore, we did not target anatomical features such as axon geometries, which cannot be robustly disentangled/quantified after downsampling, although other approaches may serve that purpose (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Andersson et al., 2020</xref>). Therefore, if the results are to be reproduced by others, then comparable imaging set-ups should be used.</p></sec></sec></sec><sec id="s4" sec-type="materials|methods"><title>Materials and methods</title><sec id="s4-1"><title>Monkey</title><p>The tissue came from a 32-mo-old female perfusion-fixated vervet (<italic>Chlorocebus aethiops</italic>) monkey brain, obtained from the Montreal Monkey Brain Bank.

To reduce susceptibility artefacts and avoid air bubbles, we scanned the monkey brain in a double-sealed plastic bag filled with PBS, whereas the mouse brain was kept in the skull and placed in a sealed plastic bag with PBS. The monkey brain data was collected on an experimental 4.7 Tesla Agilent MRI scanner, whereas the mouse brain data were collected on an experimental 7 Tesla Bruker Biospec MRI scanner. We used a quadrature radio frequency volume coil for the monkey, and a 2-parallel cryo-coil probe for the mouse brains. The isotropic image voxels were 0.55 mm for the monkey brain and 0.125 mm for the mouse.

The variation of axon diameters within some of the samples makes it challenging to capture all relevant structural orientation information with a single set of (σ,ρ)-parameters, i.e., for a single patch size. Therefore, we employed a ‘scale space structure tensor’ approach (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">Lindeberg, 1998</xref>). Here, the structure tensor is computed multiple times using a suite of varying (σ,ρ)-parameters called <italic>scales</italic>. Finally, for each voxel, we search for the dominating scale from which we retain the tensor.

With this approach, we select the structure tensor that provides the most anisotropic response across the set of manually defined scales. This ensures that the tensor-derived quantities—eigenvectors, eigenvalues, and FA—become independent of the axon diameter. Using the FA value for scale selection is reasonable, as we focus on the fibre-like axons. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="app1fig2">Appendix 1—figure 2</xref> in the Appendix illustrates the scale-space structure tensor concept applied to the monkey CC ESRF data, where the FA of three selected scales of gradually decreasing patch sizes (scales 2, 6, and 8), are shown to emphasise distinctly different microstructural features. The dominant scale illustration shows how scales with large patch sizes are selected where the axons are large.Structure tensor-based quantifications.</p><p>The ST analysis, whether using the scale space or standard variant with a single scale, provides one tensor per voxel.

The poles for this representation are poorly defined and hard to visualise. Therefore, the polar direction is aligned along the anatomical axis where we expect the least directional contribution for the particular sample. Additionally, since the bins in the parameterisation do not have equal areas, the actual area is estimated and used to normalise the histogram, obtaining a fibre orientation based probability density function.</p><p>To characterise the FOD, we fitted a spherical Bingham distribution to the FOD using the mtex toolbox (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://mtex-toolbox.github.io/BinghamODFs.html">https://mtex-toolbox.github.io/BinghamODFs.html</ext-link>). From the Bingham parameters, we derive two indices: the Orientation Dispersion Index (ODI), which describes the dispersion of the fibres on the surface of the unit sphere, and the Dispersion Anisotropy Index (DA), which expresses the anisotropic shape of the fibre dispersion (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib57">Tariq et al., 2016</xref>). Both metrics range from 0 to 1. A low ODI indicates a population of fibres with a narrow spread (a focused main direction), while a low DA suggests that the shape of the fibre dispersion is close to isotropic. It should be noted that the use of ODI and DA is only meaningful for a single pathway FOD.</p></sec><sec id="s4-9"><title>Structure tensor-based tractography</title><p>The principle and the process of structure tensor-based tractography are much the same as in diffusion MRI-based tractography, but applied to the synchrotron volumes using the direction vectors of the structure tensor and the deterministic <italic>FACT</italic> algorithm (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib63">Tournier et al., 2019</xref>). The process is controlled by defining <bold>seeding point regions</bold>, <bold>masks</bold> for rejection, inclusion/termination, and various <bold>streamlined filtering</bold> parameters, such as minimum length. We utilise an a priori anatomical understanding of the sample and it’s the axonal organisation to manually generate the seeding region(s). For example, in the CC samples, the axons should primarily run in the L-R direction. We therefore create a mask at the left and right ends of the sample (with some margin from the sample edge). When seeding points in the left region of interest (ROI), streamlines must reach the right ROI to be included, and vice versa.</p><p>In several instances, we employed inclusion or rejection masks, which defined the permitted boundaries of travel for the streamlines. In essence, these masks should roughly represent axonal tissue segmentations. Depending on the sample, such a mask can be generated by thresholding either FA - or image intensity values, followed by morphological operations (opening, closing) to close holes and remove small spurious regions.</p><sec id="s4-9-1"><title>Streamline clustering</title><p>The output of tractography is unstructured, thus often resulting in an overabundance of streamlines, which may be hard to interpret. It is then beneficial to apply a streamline clustering method, which can collect multiple streamlines into meaningful axonal bundles/fasciculi, while filtering away lone and spurious streamlines. To this end, we used the QuickBundles method (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Garyfallidis et al., 2012</xref>), known for its simplicity and scalability, with manual selection of the distance threshold parameter for each sample individually.</p></sec><sec id="s4-9-2"><title>Streamline analysis</title><p>We use two different metrics to quantify the clustered tractography streamlines: Tortuosity and maximum deviation.</p><p>The tortuosity index is a single number representing the non-straightness of the trajectory of each streamline.

The work is at the forefront of the anatomical investigation of the human connectome and aligns with several current efforts to bridge the resolution gap between what we can see in vivo at the millimeter scale and the complexity of the human brain at the sub-micron scale. The authors compare the 3D white matter organization across modalities within 2 small regions in one monkey brain (body of the corpus callosum, centrum semiovale) and within one region (splenium of the corpus callosum) in healthy mice and in one murine model of focal demyelination. The study compares measures of tissue anisotropy and fiber orientations across modalities, performs a qualitative comparison of fasciculi trajectories across brain regions and tissue conditions using streamlined tractography based on the structure tensor, and attempts to quantify the shape of fasciculi trajectories by measuring the tortuosity index and the maximum deviation for each reconstructed streamline. Results show measures of anisotropy and fiber orientations largely agree across modalities, especially for larger FOV data. The high-resolution data allows us to explore the fiber trajectories in relation to tissue complexity and pathology. The authors claim the study reveals new common organization principles of white matter fibers across species and scales, for which axonal fasciculi arrange into sheet-like laminar structures.</p><p>Strengths:</p><p>The aim of the study is of central importance within present efforts to bridge the gap between macroscopic structures observable in vivo in humans using conventional diffusion MRI and the microscopic organization of white matter tissue. Results obtained from this type of study are important to interpret data obtained in vivo, inform the development of novel methodologies, and expand our knowledge of the structural and thus functional organization of brain circuits.</p><p>Multi-scale data acquired across modalities within the same sample constitute extremely valuable data that is often hard to acquire and represent a precious resource for validation of both diffusion MRI tractography and microstructure methods.</p><p>The inclusion of multi-species data adds value to the study, allowing the exploration of common organization principles across species.</p><p>The addition of data from a murine cuprizone model of focal demyelination adds interesting opportunities to study the underlying biological changes that follow demyelination and how these impact tissue anisotropy and fiber trajectories. These data can inform the interpretation and development of diffusion MRI microstructure models.</p><p>[Editors' note: The Reviewing Editor considers that the authors addressed the reviewers' questions adequately.

Cross-modality comparisons are interesting as the different methods are able to probe anatomical structures at different length scales, from single axons in high-resolution synchrotron (ESRF) imaging, to clusters of axons in lower-resolution synchrotron (DEXY) data, to axon populations at the mm-scale in diffusion MRI. By acquiring all modalities in monkey and mouse ex vivo samples, the authors can observe principles of fibre organisation, and characterise how fibre characteristics, such as tortuosity and micro-dispersion, vary across select brain regions and in healthy tissue versus a demyelination model. The results are solid, though some statements (in the abstract/discussion) do not appear to be fully supported, and statistical tests would help confirm whether tissue characteristics are similar/different between different conditions.</p></disp-quote><p>R1.1: Thank you for the kind feedback. We have included statistical tests in the paper for tissue characteristics where appropriate.</p><p>Due to the very high number of sample points (one per voxel) within the 3D synchrotron volumes, testing for statistical significance is challenging for the structure tensor-based tissue fractional anisotropy (FA) metric. This causes any standard statistical test to have sufficient power to evaluate even minute differences between the volumes as statistically significant with high confidence. In other words, the null hypothesis (H0) will always be rejected with p = 0, regardless of the practical significance of the difference. Therefore, we have not added statistical analysis for FA results.</p><p>For the tractography based metrics, the number of sample points (one per streamline) is not as high as that for the structure tensor FA, thus making it more reasonable to test for statistical significance. The statistical analyses performed included tests for equality of distributions (Two-sample Kolmogorov-Smirnov tests), equality of medians (Two-sided Wilcoxon rank sum tests), and equality of variance (Brown-Forsythe tests). The results are described in relation to Figure 5(B, D), Figure 8(CF), and detailed in the Methods section.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>One very interesting result is the observation of apparent laminar organisation of fibres in ex vivo monkey white matter samples. DESY data from the corpus callosum shows fibres with two dominant orientations (one L-R, one slightly inclined), clustered in laminar structures within this major fibre bundle. Thanks to the authors providing open data, I was able to look through the raw DESY volume and observe regions with different &quot;textures&quot; (different orientations) in the described laminar arrangement. That this organisation can be observed by eye, as well as by structure tensor, is fairly convincing. As not all readers will download the data themselves, the manuscript could benefit from additional figures/videos to demonstrate (1) the quality of the DESY data and (2) a more 3D visualisation of the laminar structures (where the coronal plane shows convincing columnar structure or stripes). Similarly in Figure 5A, though this nicely depicts two populations with different orientations, it is somewhat difficult to see the laminar structure in the current image.</p><p>ESRF data of the centrum semiovale (CS) contributes evidence for similar laminar structures in a crossing fibre region, where primarily AP fibres are shown to cluster in 3 laminar structures. As above, further visualisations of the ESRF volume in the CS (as shown in Figure 4E) would be of value (e.g. showing consistency across the 4 volumes, 2D images showing stripey/columnar patterns along different axes, etc).</p></disp-quote><p>R1.2: Conveying complex 3D geometry through 2D still images is indeed challenging, and we greatly appreciate the reviewer’s comments and suggestions. To better communicate the understanding of the 3D anatomical environments, we have taken the following actions:</p><p>(1) To enhance insights into the tractography results in Figures 5A and 5D, we have rendered and added animations of the tractography scenes as supplemental material.</p><p>(2) To visually support 3D insights concerning the consistency of the laminar organisation of the callosal fibres, we have replaced the 2D slice views in Figures 3A and 3B with 3D renderings similar to the one in Figure 4E.</p><p>(3) An animation of Figure 4E was created to display the colour-coded structure tensor directions of all four stacked scans. This animation visually supports the complexity of the fibre orientation and the layered structural laminar organisation of the CS sample.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>A key limitation of this result is that, though the DESY data from the CC seems convincing, the same structures were not observed in high-resolution synchrotron (ESRF) data of the same tissue sample in the corpus callosum. This seems surprising and the manuscript does not provide a convincing explanation for this inconsistency. The authors argue that this is due to the limited FOV of the ESRF data (~200x200x800 microns). However, the observed laminar structures in DESY are ~40 microns thick, and ERSF data from the CST suggests laminar thicknesses in the range of 5-40 microns with a similar FOV. This suggests the ERSF FOV would be sufficient to capture at least a partial description of the laminar organisation. Further, the DESY data from the CC shows columnar variations along the LR axis, which we might expect to be observed along the long axis of the ESFR volume of the same sample. Additional analyses or explanations to reconcile these apparently conflicting observations would be of value. For example, the authors could consider down-sampling the ESRF data in an appropriate manner to make it more similar to the DESY data, and running the same analysis, to see if the observed differences are related to resolution (i.e. the thinner laminar structures cluster in ways that they look like a thicker laminar structure at lower resolution), or crop the DESY data to the size of the ESRF volume, to test whether the observed differences can be explained by differences in FOV. Laminar structures were not observed in mouse data, though it is unclear if this is due to anatomical differences or somewhat related to differences in data quality across species.</p></disp-quote><p>R1.3: We have clarified and expanded upon the results regarding the laminar organisation observed in the monkey CC DESY data. As noted in R1.2, we replaced the 2D images in Figures 3A (DESY) and 3B (ESRF) with 3D renderings to better display the spatial outline of the laminar organisation in the volumes. The reviewer is correct that, although the smaller field of view (FOV) of the ESRF data should allow us to at least partially capture parts of the laminar organisation observed in the larger FOV of the DESY data, this is not guaranteed. It depends on how the smaller FOV is positioned relative to the structural organisation, and since we lack co-registration, we do not know this. It should now be visually evident that the ESRF FOV can be placed such that it does not cover the observed laminae, a point which is now also emphasised in the Discussion.</p><p>Secondly, it is important to emphasise that the voxel colouring using the primary structure tensor direction is just a visualisation technique, which has limitations when it comes to assessing laminar organisation. Mapping 3D directions to RGB colours is inherently difficult and will always have ambiguities. If we had used the standard R-G-B to LR-AP-IS colouring in Figure 3, the laminar organisation would not be evident. Additionally, the laminae will only be visible when there are clear angular differences. There can still be a layered organisation even if we don’t observe it, which is the case for the mouse. The primary direction differences of these layers could be very low (i.e., parallel layers), and consequently not visually evident. This point has been clarified in both the Results and Discussion sections.</p><p>Finally, in response to R1.6, we have added analyses regarding the shape of the FOD, specifically estimating the Orientation Dispersion Index (ODI) and Dispersion Anisotropy (DA). This provides further context to the reviewer’s comments about the discrepancies in laminar organisation. We have reflected on the relationship between DA and the visually observed laminar organisation, and this has been integrated into the relevant parts of the Results and Discussion sections.</p><p>The changes to manuscript reflecting the statements above are listed here:</p><p>The Discussion section (page 21): “In the monkey CC DESY data, which has a field of view (FOV) comparable to a dMRI voxel, a columnar laminar organisation at a macroscopic level was visually revealed from the structure tensor (ST) direction colouring. However, this laminar organisation was not visible in the higher-resolution ESRF data for the same tissue sample. Although the two samples were not co-registered, the size of a single ESRF FOV within the DESY sample is illustrated in Fig. 3A. This demonstrates the possibility of placing the ESRF sample where the observed laminar structure is absent. Consequently, knowledge of the tissue structural organisation and its orientation is important to fully benefit from the stacked FOV of the ESRF sample and when choosing appropriate minimal FOV sizes in future experiments.</p><p>Interestingly, when characterising FODs with measures like ODI and DA as indicators of fibre organisation, rather than relying on visualisation, results from large- and small-FOV data show no discrepancies. This statistical approach discards the spatial context (visually perceived as laminae), highlighting the need to combine both methods.”</p><p>The Results section (page 8): “The mid-level DA values suggest some anisotropic spread of the directions, reflecting the angled laminar organisation observed in the DESY sample. Interestingly, the DA value for the ESRF sample is almost identical, despite the laminar bands being less visually apparent.”</p><p>The Results section (page 17): “Nevertheless, visualisation of orientations did not reveal any axonal organisation in the mouse CC due to the lack of local angular contrast, unlike the clear laminar structures seen in the monkey sample (Fig. 3A). Any parallel organisation in tissue remains undetectable because our visual contrast relies on angular differences.”</p><p>The Discussion section (page 22): “In the monkey CC (mid-body), we observed laminar organisation indicated by clear spatial angular differences in the ST directions in the sample (Fig. 3A). Quantifications of the FOD shape showed DA indices of 0.55 and 0.59 for the DESY and ESRF samples, respectively. In contrast, the mouse CC (splenium) did not visually reveal a similar angled laminar organisation (Fig. 7C), and the DA indices were lower, at 0.49 and 0.32, respectively. Two possible explanations exist. First, the within-pathway laminar organisation may not be identical across the entire CC. Consequently, more scans from other CC regions would be required to confirm. Second, the different species might account for the differences. Larger brains like the monkey might foster a different level of within-pathway axon organisation compared to the smaller mouse. Although we could not visually detect laminar organisation from the colour coding of the ST direction in the mouse, the non-zero DA values suggest some level of organisation. This is supported by our streamline tractography, which indicates a vertical layered organisation (Fig. 8A, B). It further aligns with studies using histological tracer mapping that shows a stacked parallel organisation of callosal projections in mice, between cortex regions M1 and S1 (Zhou et al. 2013). Nevertheless, we cannot rely solely on voxel-wise ST directions to fully describe axonal organisation, as this method does not contrast almost parallel fasciculi (inclination angles approaching 0 degrees). Analysing patterns in tractography streamlines would be an interesting future direction for this purpose.”</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>The authors further quantify various other characteristics of the white matter, such as micro-dispersion, tortuosity, and maximum displacement. Notably, the microscopic FA calculated via structure tensor is fairly consistent across regions, though not modalities. When fibre orientations are combined across the sample, they are shown to produce similar FODs to dMRI acquired in the same tissue, which is reassuring. As noted in the text, the estimates of tortuosity and max displacement are dependent on the FOV over which they are calculated. Calculating these metrics over the same FOV, or making them otherwise invariant to FOV, could facilitate more meaningful comparisons across samples and/or modalities.</p></disp-quote><p>R1.4: This raises an interesting point about the necessity of normalising the FOV to obtain invariant, tractography-based metrics of tortuosity and maximum deviation across different samples and modalities. In general, achieving this is challenging, and in this study, it is practically not possible. Between species, we encounter significant differences in brain volume ratios, which complicates the establishment of a common reference FOV due to the distinct anatomical organisation of monkey and mouse brains (see our response to R1.8). Within species, we would encounter challenges due to missing contrast—such as issues with staining—and the lack of perfect co-registration.</p><p>The Discussion section (page 28) has been extended to reflect this: ”Within the same species, assuming perfect co-registration of samples, it would be possible to perform correlative imaging and analysis. This would allow validation of whether tractography streamlines could be reproduced at different image resolutions within the same normalised FOV. Although this was not possible with the current data and experimental setup, it would be an interesting point to pursue in future work.”</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Though the results seem solid, some statements, particularly in the abstract and discussion, do not seem to be fully supported by the data. For example, the abstract states &quot;Our findings revealed common principles of fibre organisation in the two species; small axonal fasciculi and major bundles formed laminar structures with varying angles, according to the characteristics of major pathways.&quot;, though the results show &quot;no strong indication within the mouse CC of the axonal laminar organisation observed in the monkey&quot;. Similarly, the introduction states: &quot;By these means, we demonstrated a new organisational principle of white matter that persists across anatomical length scales and species, which governs the arrangement of axons and axonal fasciculi into sheet-like laminar structures.&quot; Further comments on the text are provided below.</p></disp-quote><p>R1.5: We understand that it can be misunderstood that the laminar organisation is identical in monkeys and mice, which is not the case. For example, we show that in the corpus callosum, pathways are parallel in the mouse but not in the monkey. We have clarified that while the principle of layered laminar organisation of pathways is shared between monkeys and mice, species-specific differences do exist.</p><p>We have made the following clarifying changes to the manuscript:</p><p>The Abstract (page 2): “Our findings revealed common principles of fibre organisation that apply despite the varying patterns observed across species”</p><p>The Introduction (page 4-5): “Through these methods, we demonstrated organisational principles of white matter that persists across anatomical length scales and species. These principles govern the organisation of axonal fasciculi into sheet-like laminar shapes (structures with a predominant planar arrangement). Interestingly, while these principles remain consistent, they result in varied structural organisations in different species.”</p><p>The Discussion (page 21): “despite species differences”.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>One observation not notably discussed in the paper is that the spherical histograms of Figure 3E/H appear to have an anisotropic spread of the white points about 0,0. It would be interesting if the authors could comment on whether this could be interpreted as the FOD having asymmetric dispersion and if so, whether the axis of dispersion relates to the fibre orientations of the laminar structures.</p></disp-quote><p>R1.6: That is a good point, and to address it, we have fitted spherical Bingham distributions to the FODs, allowing us to quantify their shapes. From each Bingham distribution, we derived two wellknown indices from the diffusion MRI community: the Orientation Dispersion Index (ODI) and Dispersion Anisotropy (DA) index. The ODI explains the dispersion of fibres for a single bundle FOD, whereas DA expresses the shape of the FOD on the unit sphere surface, i.e., the degree of anisotropy. We have integrated the Bingham-based analysis into the Methods, Discussion, and Results sections concerning Figures 3 and 7, but not Figure 4, which contains multiple fibre bundles that we cannot separate on a voxel level. The analysis does not impact the overall message and conclusion but adds interesting context to the discussion around laminar organisation.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>A limitation of the study is that it considers only small ex vivo tissue samples from two locations in a single postmortem monkey brain and slightly larger regions of mouse brain tissue. Consequently, further evidence from additional brain regions and subjects would be required to support more generalised statements about white matter organisation across the brain.</p></disp-quote><p>R1.7: Collecting more samples from various locations in the brain would provide valuable insights into the consistency of white matter organisation across anatomical length scales, as well as the structuretensor based anisotropy and tortuosity metrics. However, being awarded beamtime at two different synchrotron facilities to scan the same sample with different imaging setups is practically challenging. At the ESRF, we have gathered additional image volumes from other white matter regions of the monkey brain that support all our findings, which will be published separately. X-ray synchrotron imaging technology is advancing rapidly, with faster acquisition times enabling more image volumes to be stitched together. This extends the FOV and allows for a more robust statistical description of the anatomy. Consequently, future studies with an extended FOV and varying image resolutions could utilise a single synchrotron facility to collect additional samples, further supporting our findings.</p><p>The Discussion section (page 27) has been extended to reflect this: “Increasing the number of samples across both species and examining laminar organisation at various length scales in more regions would strengthen our findings. However, securing beamtime at two different synchrotron facilities to scan the same sample with varying image resolutions is a limiting factor. Beamline development for multiresolution experimental setups, along with faster acquisition methods, is a rapidly advancing field. For instance, the Hierarchical Phase-Contrast Tomography (HiP-CT) imaging beamline at ID-18 at the ESRF, enables multi-resolution imaging within a single session to address this challenge, though it is currently limited to a resolution of 2.5 μm (Walsh et al. 2021).”</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Given the monkey results, the mouse study (section 2.5 onwards) lacks some motivation. In particular, it is unclear why a demyelination model was studied and if/how this would link to the laminar structure observed in the monkey data. Further, it is unclear how comparable tortuosity/max deviation values are across species, considering the differences in data quality and relative resolution, given that the presented results show these values are very modality-dependent.</p></disp-quote><p>R1.8: We have clarified the motivation for including the mouse part of the study in both the Introduction and the Results sections.</p><p>The Introduction section (page 5): “Furthermore, using a mouse model of focal demyelination induced by cuprizone (CPZ) treatment, we investigate the inflammation-related influence on axonal organisation. This is achieved through the same structure tensor-derived micro-anisotropy and tractography streamline metrics.”</p><p>The Results section (page 15): “Finally, we investigated the organisation of fasciculi in both healthy mouse brains and a murine model of focal demyelination induced by five weeks of cuprizone (CPZ) treatment. This allowed for the exploration of the disease-related influence on axonal organisation, particularly under inflammation-like conditions with high glial cell density at the demyelination site (He et al. 2021). The experimental setup for DESY and ESRF is similar to that described for the monkey, with the exception that we did not perform dMRI and synchrotron imaging on the same brains, and only collected MRI data for healthy mouse brains. This approach allowed us to apply the same structure tensor and tractography streamline analysis used previously, but in a healthy versus disease comparison, demonstrating the methodology’s ability to provide insights into pathological conditions.”</p><p>Across species, the comparison of tortuosity and maximum deviation must be approached with caution. On one hand, we observe a comparable influence of the extra-axonal environment in both the monkey and mice, as discussed in the section “Sources to the non-straight trajectories of axon fasciculi.” On the other hand, the anatomical scale and relative image resolution are significant factors, as correctly pointed out. In the mouse, for instance, the measures are influenced by white matter pathway macroscopic effects, making cross-species comparison challenging to perform in a normalised way.</p><p>The limitations section of the Discussion (page 28) has been updated to reflect this: ”A limiting consequence of having samples imaged at differing anatomical scales is that certain measures become inherently hard to compare in a normalised way. The tractography-based metrics—tortuosity and maximum deviation—serve as good examples of this resolution and FOV dependence. In the ESRF samples, the anatomical scale was at the level of individual axons, and the streamline metrics primarily reflect micro-scale effects from the extra-axonal environment, such as the influence of cells and blood vessels. In comparison, the larger anatomical scale in the DESY samples represents the level of fasciculi and above, with metrics influenced by macroscopic effects, such as the bending of the CC pathway. Both scales are interesting and can provide valuable insights in their own right, but caution is required when comparing the numbers, especially for cross-species studies where there is a significant difference in brain volume ratios.”</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>The paper introduces a new method of &quot;scale-space&quot; parameters for structure tensors. Since, to my understanding, this is the first description of the method, some simple validation of the method would be welcomed. Further, the same scale parameters are not used across monkeys and mice, with a larger kernel used in mice (Table 2) which is surprising given their smaller brain size. Some explanation would be helpful.</p></disp-quote><p>R1.9: We have expanded the description of the scale-space structure tensor approach in the Methods section. Specifically, we have elaborated on the empirical process used to select the scale-space parameters shown in Table 2 and explained why multiple scales were applied only to the monkey samples scanned at ESRF (see Table 2, sample IDs 2 and 3) but not to the other datasets. Additionally, we have added a supplementary figure to assist in illustrating the concept.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p><bold>Reviewer #2 (Public Review):</bold></p><p>Summary:</p><p>In this work, the authors combine diffusion MRI and high-resolution x-ray synchrotron phase-contrast imaging in monkey and mouse brains to investigate the 3D organization of brain white matter across different scales and species. The work is at the forefront of the anatomical investigation of the human connectome and aligns with several current efforts to bridge the resolution gap between what we can see in vivo at the millimeter scale and the complexity of the human brain at the sub-micron scale. The authors compare the 3D white matter organization across modalities within 2 small regions in one monkey brain (body of the corpus callosum, centrum semiovale) and within one region (splenium of the corpus callosum) in healthy mice and in one murine model of focal demyelination. The study compares measures of tissue anisotropy and fiber orientations across modalities, performs a qualitative comparison of fasciculi trajectories across brain regions and tissue conditions using streamlined tractography based on the structure tensor, and attempts to quantify the shape of fasciculi trajectories by measuring the tortuosity index and the maximum deviation for each reconstructed streamline. Results show measures of anisotropy and fiber orientations largely agree across modalities, especially for larger FOV data. The high-resolution data allows us to explore the fiber trajectories in relation to tissue complexity and pathology. The authors claim the study reveals new common organization principles of white matter fibers across species and scales, for which axonal fasciculi arrange into sheet-like laminar structures.</p><p>Strengths:</p><p>The aim of the study is of central importance within present efforts to bridge the gap between macroscopic structures observable in vivo in humans using conventional diffusion MRI and the microscopic organization of white matter tissue. Results obtained from this type of study are important to interpret data obtained in vivo, inform the development of novel methodologies, and expand our knowledge of the structural and thus functional organization of brain circuits.</p><p>Multi-scale data acquired across modalities within the same sample constitute extremely valuable data that is often hard to acquire and represent a precious resource for validation of both diffusion MRI tractography and microstructure methods.</p><p>The inclusion of multi-species data adds value to the study, allowing the exploration of common organization principles across species.</p><p>The addition of data from a murine cuprizone model of focal demyelination adds interesting opportunities to study the underlying biological changes that follow demyelination and how these impact tissue anisotropy and fiber trajectories. These data can inform the interpretation and development of diffusion MRI microstructure models.</p><p>Weaknesses:</p><p>The main claim of a newly discovered laminar organization principle that is consistent across scales and species is not supported strongly enough by the data. The main evidence in support of the claim comes from the larger FOV data obtained from the body of the corpus callosum in the monkey brain. A laminar organization principle is partially shown in the centrum semiovale in the monkey brain and it is not shown in mice data. Additionally, the methods lack details to help the correct interpretation of these findings (e.g., how were these fasciculi defined?; how well do they represent different axonal populations?; what is the effect of blood vessels on the structure tensor reconstruction?; how was laminar separation quantified?) and the discussion does not provide a biological background for this organization. The corpus callosum sample suggests axons within a bundle of fibers are organized in a sheet-like fashion, while data from the centrum semiovale suggest fibers belonging to different fiber bundles are organized in a sheet-like arrangement. While I acknowledge the challenges in acquiring such high-resolution data, additional samples from different regions in the same animals and from different animals would help strengthen this claim.</p></disp-quote><p>R2.1</p><p>- how were these fasciculi defined?</p><p>In the introduction (page 3), we have clarified our definition of an axon fasciculus: “A fasciculus is a bundle of axons that travel together over short or long distances. Its size and shape can vary depending on its internal organisation and its relationship to neighbouring fasciculi.”</p><p>Additionally, we emphasise in the Results section (page 12) that the centroid streamlines are not guaranteed to be actual fasciculi, but rather representations of them. The paragraph now states: “To ease visualisation and quantification, we used QuickBundle clustering(Garyfallidis et al. 2012) to group neighbouring streamlines with similar trajectories into a centroid streamline. This centroid streamline serves as an approximation of the actual trajectory of a fasciculus.”</p><p>- what is the effect of blood vessels on the structure tensor reconstruction?</p><p>Fair point, that was not clear from our description. The clarification contains two parts. First, the estimation of the structure tensor occurs in all voxels, and in that sense, the blood vessels respond very similarly to axons. Second, when it comes to sample statistics derived from the structure tensor analysis (FA histograms and the FODs), they will have an influence, albeit a small one, given the low volume percentage of the blood vessels within the FOVs. In the monkey samples, segmenting the blood vessels was achievable with little effort, allowing us to exclude their contribution from FA statistics and FODs. To make this clear, we have added a paragraph to the Methods section (page 34) titled “Structure tensor-based quantifications,” reflecting this clarification. Additionally, we have restructured the entire structure tensor methods description (starting on page 32) as part of the reviewer comments in R1.6 and R1.9.</p><p>- how was laminar separation quantified?</p><p>We have added a clarification in Results section (page 7): “The laminar thickness was determined by manual measurements on laminae visually identified in the 3D volume”.</p><p>- discussion does not provide a biological background for this organization.</p><p>A good point. Including the biological background is relevant as it supports the laminar organisation of white matter pathways observed in our findings and those of others.</p><p>We have added a section on this background in the Discussion (page 24): “We believe our observed topological rule of white matter laminar organisation can be explained by a biological principle known from studies of nervous tissue development. The first axons to reach their destination, guided by their growth cones, are known as “pioneering” axons. “Follower” axons use the shaft of the pioneering axon for guidance to efficiently reach the target region (Breau and Trembleau 2023). Axons can form a fasciculus by fasciculating or defasciculating along their trajectory through a zippering or unzipping mechanism, controlled by chemical, mechanical, and geometrical parameters. Zippering “glues” the axons together, while unzipping allows them to defasciculate at a low angle (Šmít et al. 2017). Although speculative, the zippering mechanism may be responsible for forming the laminar topology observed across length scales. The defasciculation effect can explain our results in the corpus callosum (CC) of monkeys, with laminar structures at low angles (~35 degrees) also observed by (Innocenti et al. 2019; Caminiti et al. 2009), as well as in other major pathways (Sarubbo et al. 2019). In contrast, a fasciculation mechanism may be observed in the mouse CC (0 degrees). If the geometrical angle between two axons is high, i.e., toward 90 degrees, the zippering mechanism will not occur, and the two axons (fasciculi) will cross (Šmít et al. 2017). This supports our and other findings that crossing fasciculi or pathways occur at high angles toward 90 degrees in the fully matured brain (Wedeen et al. 2012). Once myelination begins, the zippering mechanism is lost (Šmít et al. 2017), suggesting that laminar topology is established at the earliest stages of brain maturation.”</p><p>- additional samples from different regions in the same animals and from different animals would help strengthen this claim</p><p>Reviewer #1 also pointed to the inclusion of additional samples, and this is now discussed as part of the study limitations on page 27 (see also R1.7).</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>The main goal of the study is to bridge the organization of white matter across anatomical length scales and species. However, given the substantial difference in FOVs between the two imaging modalities used, and the absence of intermediate-resolution data, it remains difficult to effectively understand how these results can be used to inform conventional diffusion MRI. In this sense, the introduction does not do a good enough job of building a strong motivation for the scientific questions the authors are trying to answer with these experiments and for the specific methodology used.</p></disp-quote><p>R2.2: Indeed, this is an essential point now emphasised in the introduction, page 3, which now states: ”Despite the limited resolution of dMRI, the water diffusion process can reveal microstructural geometrical features, such as axons and cell bodies, though these features are compounded at the voxel level. Consequently, estimating microstructural characteristics depends on biophysical modelling assumptions, which can often be simplistic due to limited knowledge of the 3D morphology of cells and axons and their intermediate-level topological organisation within a voxel. Thus, complementary highresolution imaging techniques that directly capture axon morphology and fasciculi organisation in 3D across different length scales within an MRI voxel are essential for understanding anatomy and improving the accuracy of dMRI-based models(Alexander et al. 2019).”</p><p>Additionally, in the introduction, page 4, we have made the following changes to strengthen the link across modalities, such that it now states: “In the x-ray synchrotron data, we applied a scale-space structure tensor analysis, which allowed for the quantification of structure tensor-derived tissue anisotropy and FOD in the same anatomical regime indirectly detected by dMRI.”</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>The cuprizone data represent a unique opportunity to explore the effect of demyelination on white matter tissue. However, this specific part of the study is not well motivated in the introduction and seems to represent a missed opportunity for further exploration of the qualitative and quantitative relationship between diffusion MRI and sub-micron tissue information (although unfortunately not within the same brain sample). This is especially true considering the diffusion MRI protocol for mice would allow extrapolation of advanced measures from different tissue compartments.</p></disp-quote><p>R2.3: A similar point was raised by Reviewer 1 (R1.8), and we have clarified the motivation for including the healthy mice and the demyelination samples.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p><bold>Recommendations for the authors:</bold></p><p><bold>Reviewer #1 (Recommendations For The Authors):</bold></p><p>Many thanks to the authors for providing open data.

For example, the green tensors in Figures 3 C and D are tilted up/down in opposite directions and the streamlines in Figure 5A seem opposite (SL) from what we would expect from Figure 2A (SR). Having consistent orientations across modalities and images would help the reader. When colouring tensors (e.g. in Figure 3), the authors could consider a 3D colour scheme (similar to that used by diffusion MRI) rather than colouring by only inclination, as this would provide useful information on whether different laminae have similar orientations, as implied by the tractography in Figure 4.</p></disp-quote><p>R1.11: Thank you for spotting the suboptimal consistency between Figures 2, 3, and 5.

This was to assist in the visualisation of the inclination angle between the laminars. We have used the same colour scheme for the tensors in Figure 3 to avoid confusion.</p><p>On a general note, the standard colour scheme has uniform “colour contrast” in all directions, but when there is only a single dominant direction in the sample, it can make sense to concentrate the colour contrast in that axis.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Results: &quot;even higher FA anisotropy in the micro-tensor domain of 0.997, i.e., the micro (μ)FA (20, 21).&quot; I understand these references lead to a definition of μFA that is based on multiple diffusion tensor encodings which is quite different from that suggested by Kaden.

We have reformulated the sentence to state: “Quantifications of fibre orientation distributions were consistent across anatomical length scales and modalities, whereas tissue anisotropy had a more complex relationship, both dependent on the field-of-view”.</p><p>While it is true that we only present the ST-derived quantifications – FOD and FA statistics – for a single FOV per modality and sample, the results shown for the ESRF monkey samples (Figures 3 and 4) are a merge of four individually processed volumes. The quantifications of each individual subFOV have now been added as a supplementary figure (Figure S3) to highlight the consistency of the methodology and the effect of shifting the FOV position. In the case of the mouse, we have two volumes from different mice, which also display similar FOD and FA statistics.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Abstract: &quot;Our study emphasises the need to balance field-of-view and voxel size when characterising white matter features across anatomical length scales.&quot;</p><p>This point does not seem very well explored in the paper, rather it is an observation of the limitations of the different imaging modalities. For example, there aren't analyses to compare metrics from highresolution data at different FOVs (i.e. by taking neighbourhoods of different sizes), nor are metrics compared from data at different resolutions and the same FOV.</p></disp-quote><p>R1.17: The question is related to R1.16, R1.4, and R1.8, and we have addressed this point in our responses to those comments.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Figure 7 - Taking into account the eigenvalues can be helpful when interpreting the secondary and tertiary eigenvectors of tensors (V2 and V3). It would be interesting to know whether the eigenvalues L2 ~ = L3 are approximately equal (suggesting isotropic diffusion about V1, where the definition of V2 versus V3 isn't very meaningful), or if L2 is noticeably larger than L3 (suggesting anisotropic diffusion about V1, potentially similar to the anisotropic dispersion discussed above).</p></disp-quote><p>R1.18: It would be interesting to explore the eigenvalues of the structure tensor in more detail, as has been done for the diffusion tensor. However, we believe this belongs to future work, as such additional detailed methodological analysis would complicate the already complex story. As mentioned in response to R1.10, most processed data has been made publicly available, and the rest can be requested (due to the storage size of the data sets) to perform such additional analysis.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Discussion: &quot;Importantly, our findings revealed common principles of fibre organisation in both monkeys and mice; small axonal fasciculi and major bundles formed sheet-like laminar structures,&quot; See above regarding the lack of evidence for laminar structures in mouse data.</p></disp-quote><p>R1.19: We have reformulated the text for clarification as part of R1.3. Additionally, we added FOD quantifications to support why we do not observe an apparent laminar organisation in the mouse CC— please see our response to R1.6.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Discussion: &quot;Interestingly, the dispersion magnitude is indicative of fasciculi that skirt around obstacles in the white matter such as cells and blood vessels, and the results are largely independent of both white matter complexity (straight vs crossing fibre region) and pathology.&quot; Again, do statistical tests of the various distributions support this?</p></disp-quote><p>R1.20: As part of R1.1, we have added statistical tests of significance for the quantifications of how max deviation changes when bending around objects. Indeed, the distributions are not statistically the same, and we do not wish to convey that sentiment, but they are comparable in the object sizes that they detect. As done in the abstract, we have reformulated the sentence to avoid misunderstanding and have replaced “largely independent” with “observed across.”</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Discussion: &quot;Tax et al. have demonstrated the calculation of a sheet probability index from diffusion MRI data, which suggested the presence of sheet-like features in the CC&quot;</p><p>My understanding was that this was observed in crossing fibre regions, such as where fibres projecting with the CC cross the CST, but not the main body of the CC itself. Tax defines sheet structure as &quot;composed of two tracts that cross each other on the same surface in certain regions along their trajectories.&quot; Is this a different phenomenon to the laminar structures observed here (where we observe fibres within a single tract being locally organised into laminar structures)?</p></disp-quote><p>R1.21: Thank you for pointing our attention to this. We have corrected the section in the Discussion (page 23), so it now states: “Additionally, Tax et al. have demonstrated the calculation of a gridcrossing sheet probability index from diffusion MRI data, which suggested the presence of sheet-like features in a crossing fibre region (Tax et al. 2016), which is in line with our findings in the synchrotron data. Note that the method by Tax et al. only detects sheet-like structures crossing on a grid and does not reveal laminar structures with lower inclination angles, as we observed in the monkey CC.”</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Discussion: &quot;We found that FODs were consistent across image resolutions and modalities, but only given that the FOV is the same.&quot; See above.</p></disp-quote><p>R1.22: As part of our response to R1.6, we quantified the FODs using the ODI and DA indices, which should help support our statement. Nevertheless, we have toned down the statement and reformulated the text as follows: “We found that FODs were comparable across image resolutions and modalities. The observed discrepancies can be attributed to the fact that the FOVs are not exactly matched.”</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Discussion: &quot;microscopic FA were highly correlated across modalities.&quot;</p><p>The data shows FA is considerably lower in DESY to ESRF; within modality FA is quite consistent irrespective of tissue region; and differences between the CC and CG shown in ESRF data in mice are not repeated in DESY. It is unclear from the current data if this would lead to a high correlation across modalities. Some evidence would be helpful.</p></disp-quote><p>R1.23: This is a fair point; we have not performed a correlation analysis. However, the pattern we observe for the synchrotron samples is as follows: When the anatomical length scale increases (becomes more macroscopic), the FA distribution shifts to lower values. This reflects the scale of information captured with the ST analysis (see also R1.9). Therefore, the most interesting comparison of FA statistics occurs when the resolution and anatomical length scale are approximately the same. The sentence in question has been reformulated to the following: ”Estimates of structure tensor derived microscopic FA show a clear pattern across modalities.”</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Discussion: &quot;If so, the (inclination angle) information might serve to form rules for low-resolution diffusion MRI based tractography about how best to project through bottleneck regions, which is currently a source of false-positives trajectories (6).&quot;</p><p>This is an interesting idea but it is unclear to me how this inclination information would help track through bottlenecks where, by definition, fibres are passing through with the same orientation. Some further explanation would be helpful.</p></disp-quote><p>R1.24: We have elaborated on the section in the Discussion (page 23), explaining how this can be used to improve tractography tracing through complex regions: “The reason is that standard tractography methods do not &quot;remember&quot; or follow anatomical organisation rules as they trace through complex regions. Our findings on pathway lamination and inclination angles—low for parallel-like trajectories and high for crossing-like trajectories—can help incorporate trajectory memory into these methods, reducing the risk of false trajectories”.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p><bold>Reviewer #2 (Recommendations For The Authors):</bold></p><p>Below I report comments that if addressed I believe would improve the clarity and readability of the manuscript.</p><p>- Figures 1 and 2 would be more meaningful if combined into one figure. This would allow for a direct visual comparison of the two modalities. If space is needed, I believe the second row of Figure 1 (coronal views of CC) does not add much information. It is often hard to navigate the different orientations of the tissue in the images; thus any effort in trying to help the reader visually clarify would improve readability.</p></disp-quote><p>R2.4: We considered the reviewer’s suggestion to merge Figures 2 and 3. However, this made both the figures and the main text additionally complex, so we chose to retain the original figure layout. Secondly, Figure 3 utilises a non-standard directional colormap. Keeping the colormap consistent within each figure is a feature we wish to preserve. In response to R1.11, the figures have been updated to have more consistent orientations for the monkey samples.</p><p>In Figure 2, the second row, showing a coronal view of the CC, is essential for comparison with human data in Figure S1. It highlights where we observed the columnar laminar organisation and their inclination angle, as also detected by DTI.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>- Figure 4 shows synchrotron data revealing an anterior-posterior component within the centrum semiovale that is not necessarily seen in the dMRI data. Could the authors comment on this?</p></disp-quote><p>R2.5: Thank you for pointing this out. We have now addressed this in the Results section (page 10), where we describe the observation in detail: “Interestingly, visual inspection of the colour-coded structure tensor directions in Fig. 4E shows the existence of voxels whose primary direction is along the A-P axis. However, this represents a small enough portion of the volume that it does not appear as a distinct peak on the FOD.“</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>- The authors claim they observed several purple axons crossing orthogonally in Figure 5c. However, that is not necessarily clear in the figure.</p></disp-quote><p>R2.6: We appreciate the feedback. We have now coloured the streamlines of the crossing fasciculi in Figure 5C in red.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>- Figure 5 would benefit from adding the color encoding scheme for Figure 5d, as sometimes this is not necessarily consistent.</p></disp-quote><p>R2.7: We appreciate the feedback. We have added an indication of the standard directional colour coding to Figure 5D.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>- Figure 5d shows interesting data from the complex region. However, it is hard to visualize and it looks like there are not many streamlines traveling entirely I-S? Maybe a different orientation of the sample would help visualization.</p></disp-quote><p>R2.8: A similar point was raised by Reviewer 1 (see R1.2). We have added an animation of the scene to assist in the interpretation of the 3D organisation within this complex sample.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>- The concept of axon fasciculi is not necessarily immediately clear. Adding an explanation for what the authors refer to when using this term would improve clarity.</p></disp-quote><p>R2.9: In the introduction, we now state our conceptual definition of an axon fasciculus as a number of axons that follow each other (see also R2.1).</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>- The methods do not provide details on how structure tensor FA is measured.</p></disp-quote><p>R2.10: Thank you for pointing this out. We have restructured and expanded the structure tensor description in the Methods section (see also R1.9 and R2.1), which now includes the definition of FA.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>- Why didn't the authors select the same cc region for both mice and monkeys? It seems this would have increased the strength of the comparison.</p></disp-quote><p>R2.11: We agree. The reason lies in the chronology of experiments and the fact that we cannot control where demyelination takes place. We have added a clarifying description in the Methods section (page 31): “Note that several separate beamline experiments were conducted to collect the volumes listed in Table 1. In the first two experiments, samples from the monkey brain were scanned at ESRF and DESY, respectively. The samples from the mouse brain were imaged in two subsequent experiments. Consequently, the location of the identified demyelinating lesion in the cuprizone mice, which cannot be precisely controlled, did not match the location of the CC biopsies in the monkey.”</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>- While it is mentioned in the results, the methods do not explain how vessel segmentations or cell segmentation in mice was performed and for which datasets it was performed.</p></disp-quote><p>R2.12: For the small ROI shown in Figure 6, the labelling was a manual process using the software ITK-SNAP, which has now been clarified in the corresponding figure caption. The generation of ROI masks and blood vessel segmentations involved a combination of intensity thresholding, morphological operations, and manual labelling in ITK-SNAP. This has been clarified in the restructured and expanded description of structure tensor analysis in the Methods section (starting on page 32).</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>- From the methods it is hard to understand (1) how many mice were used; (2) why dMRI was done on a different sample; (3) whether the same selenium region was selected for both healthy and CPZ animals; (4) how the registration across samples was performed.</p></disp-quote><p>R2.13: We appreciate the feedback and have inserted clarifying statements in the relevant parts of the Methods section. (1) The total number of mice included was three: one normal, one cuprizone, and one normal for MRI scanning. (2) The quality of the collected dMRI on the mouse was too poor to use, and it could not be redone as the brain had already been sliced and prepared for synchrotron experiments. (3) The same splenium section was selected for both healthy and cuprizone mice. (4) A paragraph on image registration has been added.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>- Diffusion MRI method sections would benefit from additional details on the protocols used.</p></disp-quote><p>R2.14: Thank you for pointing this out. We have added more details about the diffusion MRI protocols, including the b-value, gradient strength, and other relevant parameters.</p></body></sub-article></article>
