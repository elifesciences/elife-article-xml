sec-type="intro"><title>Introduction</title><p>Microtubules (MTs) play important roles in neuronal development by providing structural support for neurite growth and serving as tracks for intracellular transport. MTs are formed by the polymerization of α/β-tubulin heterodimers, which are crucial determinants of MT properties. Eukaryotic genomes contain multiple α- and β-tubulin genes (called isotypes) with distinct expression patterns and dynamic properties (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Janke and Magiera, 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">Lu and Zheng, 2022</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib41">Nsamba and Gupta, 2022</xref>). These tubulin isotypes are also subjected to a range of post-translational modifications (PTMs), which regulate the stability of MTs and their interaction with various microtubule-associated proteins (MAPs; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib50">Roll-Mecak, 2020</xref>). The findings of multiple tubulin isotypes with different PTMs led to the concept of a ‘tubulin code’, which suggests that the structure, dynamics, and functions of individual MTs are controlled by the tubulin isotype composition and the tubulin PTMs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Janke, 2014</xref>). Perturbation to the tubulin code can lead to MT dysfunction and are linked to human diseases (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib59">Tischfield et al., 2011</xref>).</p><p>Although previous research described the effects of several tubulin PTMs in neuronal development, these earlier studies have two potential limitations. First, the role of tubulin PTMs was often revealed by the overexpression of tubulin mutants with PTM-mimicking or unmodifiable amino acid substitutions (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib54">Shida et al., 2010</xref>). Such overexpression may create artifacts. Moreover, since the tubulin concentration in cells is controlled by autoregulation through mRNA degradation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Lin et al., 2020</xref>), overexpression of exogenous tubulins may trigger the downregulation of endogenous tubulin isotypes, complicating the interpretation of the results. Second, the effects of tubulin PTMs were also identified by studying the enzymes that add or remove specific PTMs. In some cases, the phenotypes caused by deleting the enzyme may not be the same as the elimination of the tubulin PTMs, because the enzyme may have multiple substrates, including non-tubulin substrates, or the enzyme has additional functions independent of its activity in modifying tubulins. For example, the function of α-tubulin acetyltransferase MEC-17 in regulating neurite outgrowth is independent of its enzymatic activities (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib60">Topalidou et al., 2012</xref>). Given the above two limitations and recent advances in genome editing, we reason that the role of tubulin PTMs can be directly assessed by engineering the endogenous tubulin genes.</p><p>In this study, we installed PTM-mimicking or -inactivating mutations in the endogenous loci of the <italic>Caenorhabditis elegans</italic> tubulin genes that are specific for the touch receptor neurons (TRNs) and examined the effects of these mutations on neuronal development. We and others previously established <italic>C. elegans</italic> TRNs as a model to study the effects of tubulin missense mutations on MT stability and neurite growth at the single-cell level (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">Lee et al., 2021</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib53">Savage et al., 1994</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib69">Zheng et al., 2017</xref>). TRNs are a set of six mechanosensory neurons that detect gentle body touch and have long sensory neurites along the body wall. These neurites are filled with specialized 15-protofilament MTs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Chalfie and Thomson, 1982</xref>), presumably made of MEC-12/α-tubulin and MEC-7/β-tubulin, which are the dominant tubulin isotypes in the TRNs and are expressed at much (&gt;100 times) higher levels than other tubulin isotypes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib57">Taylor et al., 2021</xref>). Mutations in <italic>mec-12</italic> and <italic>mec-7</italic> led to the reduction of MT numbers, loss of the 15-protofilament MT structure, alteration of MT stability, and defects in neurite growth and sensory functions in the TRNs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib69">Zheng et al., 2017</xref>), suggesting that MEC-12 and MEC-7 control MT structure and function in the TRNs.</p><p>Moreover, through the analysis of ~100 missense mutations in <italic>mec-12</italic> and <italic>mec-7</italic>, our previous work established three phenotypic categories for tubulin mutations: loss-of-function (<italic>lf</italic>), which caused mild defects in neurite extension, antimorphic (<italic>anti</italic>) gain-of-function, which led to significant reduction in MT stability and caused strong defects in neurite growth, and neomorphic (<italic>neo</italic>) gain-of-function, which resulted in hyperstable MTs and excessive neurite growth (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">Lee et al., 2021</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib69">Zheng et al., 2017</xref>). These distinct impacts of tubulin mutations on MT properties and neurite growth patterns provide a framework to assess and compare the varying roles of different tubulin PTMs in neuronal differentiation.</p><p>Here, by editing the endogenous <italic>mec-12</italic> and <italic>mec-7</italic> loci, we systematically studied the effects of β-tubulin S172 phosphorylation and K252 acetylation, α-tubulin K40 acetylation, and tubulin polyglutamylation and detyrosination on neurite growth and regeneration, MT stability, cargo transport, and neuronal functions. We found that the status of β-tubulin S172 phosphorylation strongly affects MT dynamics and neurite development, whereas α-tubulin K40 acetylation did not appear to affect either neuronal morphology or function in any significant way. Polyglutamylation and detyrosination of the tubulin C-terminal tail had more subtle effects on regulating MT stability and limiting ectopic neurite growth likely by modulating the interaction of microtubules with kinesin-13. Tubulin PTMs can have either negative or positive effects on axonal regeneration depending on the type of modifications. Overall, our studies establish a platform to analyze the effects of tubulin PTMs on neuronal differentiation and regeneration through the editing of neuron type-specific tubulin isotypes.</p></sec><sec id="s2" sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><sec id="s2-1"><title>β-tubulin S172 phosphorylation inhibits neurite growth</title><p>The first PTM we analyzed was the phosphorylation of β-tubulin at the well-conserved serine 172 (S172) residue (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1A</xref>). In mitotic cells, S172 phosphorylation by cyclin-dependent kinase Cdk1 led to the exclusion of the tubulins from the MTs likely because S172 phosphorylation interfered with both GTP binding to β-tubulin and the longitudinal interdimer interaction (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Fourest-Lieuvin et al., 2006</xref>). In neurons, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib43">Ori-McKenney et al., 2016</xref> found that the Minibrain Kinase (MNB) regulated MT dynamics and dendritic morphogenesis of the <italic>Drosophila</italic> class III da neurons, and <italic>Drosophila</italic> MNB was able to phosphorylate porcine β-tubulin at S172 in vitro. These results suggested that β-tubulin S172 phosphorylation may be a regulatory point for MT stability in neurons. However, the role of S172 in neurite growth has not been tested directly.</p><p>We created the phospho-mimicking S172E and the nonphosphorylatable S172A mutations in the endogenous <italic>mec-7</italic> locus through CRISPR/Cas9-mediated gene editing. We found that the <italic>mec-7(S172E</italic>) mutation led to severe defects in axonal growth in TRNs, since all neurites of ALM and PLM neurons, the two major TRN subtypes, were significantly shortened in <italic>mec-7(S172E</italic>) mutant animals. The two anteriorly directed neurites of ALM and PLM were termed ALM-AN and PLM-AN; the posteriorly directed neurite of PLM was termed PLM-PN (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1A–H</xref>). The phenotypes of S172E mutation were similar to our previously characterized <italic>mec-7(anti</italic>) alleles, which strongly suppressed neurite growth by blocking MT polymerization. In contrast, we observed the growth of an ectopic ALM posterior neurite (ALM-PN) in animals carrying the <italic>mec-7(S172A</italic>) mutation; this phenotype was similar to the <italic>mec-7(neo</italic>) alleles, which induced the growth of the ectopic ALM-PN by increasing MT stability. <italic>mec-7(S172A</italic>) mutants showed mild shortening of ALM-AN and PLM-AN, which were also observed with other <italic>mec-7(neo</italic>) alleles (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib69">Zheng et al., 2017</xref>). Being consistent with the genetic nature of gain-of-function mutants, both S172E and S172A mutations were semidominant since heterozygotes showed similar but less severe phenotypes than the homozygotes (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1B–C</xref>).</p><fig-group><fig id="fig1" position="float"><label>Figure 1.</label><caption><title>Substitution of MEC-7/β-tubulin S172 led to neurite growth defects in <italic>C. elegans</italic> TRNs.</title><p>(<bold>A</bold>) Neurite morphologies of ALM and PLM neurons.

Thus, S172E, S172A, and S172P mutations had three distinct phenotypes matching the three categories we previously defined (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib69">Zheng et al., 2017</xref>). Based on these phenotypic similarities, we reasoned that increased phosphorylation (S172E) likely prevented polymerization, leading to severe defects in neurite extension, whereas abolishing phosphorylation (S172A) led to hyperstable MTs and excessive neurite growth. The S172P mutation probably disrupted protein folding or blocked GTP binding, which rendered MEC-7 inactive and caused a <italic>lf</italic> phenotype identical to the <italic>mec-7(-</italic>) mutants (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib69">Zheng et al., 2017</xref>).</p><p>To confirm that MEC-7 S172 phosphorylation affects neurite growth cell-autonomously, we extracted the TRNs from the embryos and differentiated them in vitro. Wild-type TRNs grew long neurites in culture, whereas S172E but not S172A mutation significantly shortened the in vitro developed neurites, supporting that S172 phosphorylation controls neuronal morphology in a cell-intrinsic manner (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1I–J</xref>).

Moreover, anterior neurites in wild-type TRNs (e.g. ALM-AN) had uniformly plus-end-out MTs, whereas S172E mutants showed mixed MT polarity (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2C</xref>). The altered MT dynamic properties were consistent with the defects in neurite growth. To assess the difference in MT stability between the wild-type and S172A mutants (both of which showed limited dynamics under normal conditions), we treated the animals with low concentration of colchicine to depolymerize the MTs and then monitored MT dynamics during the recovery phase. Under this sensitized condition, we found that S172A mutants showed fewer EBP-2 comets than the wild-type animals, which suggested reduced MT dynamics and elevated stability (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2A–B</xref>).

In the wild-type TRNs, the MT bundles were only found in the axons but not the cell body according to previous electron microscopy studies (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Chalfie and Thomson, 1979</xref>). Another hypothesis is that the incorporation of nonphosphorylatable MEC-7(S172A) into MTs might affect GTP hydrolysis and thus expand the EBP-2 binding region beyond the MT tips, since EB2 has a specific nucleotide-dependent binding property (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib51">Roth et al., 2018</xref>).</p><p>S172 phosphorylation also affected cargo transport in TRNs.

Moreover, the transport of synaptic vesicles was also disrupted in <italic>mec-7(S172E</italic>) mutants. For example, wild-type PLM-AN branches at a position close to the vulva; the branch forms chemical synapses with the neurites in the ventral nerve cord, where the synaptic vesicles are transported to (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2G</xref>). In <italic>mec-7(S172E</italic>) mutants, the vesicles were mostly trapped in the cell bodies or along the proximal segment of the neurite, probably due to highly unstable MTs (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2G</xref>). About 40% of PLM-AN in <italic>mec-7(S172A</italic>) mutants grew no branches or had a ‘hook’ defect, and in these cases synaptic vesicles were trapped at the distal end of the neurite (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2G</xref>). Interestingly, synaptic vesicles were also transported to the ectopic ALM-PN in <italic>mec-7(S172A</italic>) mutants (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2G</xref>), as previously observed in other <italic>mec-7(neo</italic>) mutants (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib69">Zheng et al., 2017</xref>).</p><p>At the behavioral level, both S172E and S172P mutants showed strong defects in touch sensitivity, similar to the <italic>mec-7(-</italic>) deletion allele.

Since stable MTs are essential for the mechanosensory function of the TRNs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib52">Savage et al., 1989</xref>), reducing MT stability through S172 hyperphosphorylation was expected to affect TRN functions.</p></sec><sec id="s2-3"><title>Optimal level of MEC-7/β-tubulin S172 phosphorylation is required for axonal regeneration</title><p>One of the important functions of MTs is to support neuronal regeneration, and previous work have established the TRNs as an important model for axonal regeneration (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib64">Wu et al., 2007</xref>). In our hands, following laser axotomy,~72% wild-type PLM neurons were able to regrow the proximal axon for a short length to connect with the distal fragment (defined as reconnection), whereas the other ~28% PLM did not reconnect the severed axons and instead grew the proximal axon for a substantial length (defined as regrowth). We found that the <italic>mec-7(S172E</italic>) mutants were not able to reconnect the severed axons (only 4% reconnection) because the regrowth length was very short (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2I–K</xref>). A mesh-like structure with short sprouts were observed at the regrowth site. We reasoned that the dynamic MTs may be too unstable to support any substantial regrowth in the S172E mutants. Notably, these regeneration defects were different from that seen in the <italic>dlk-1(-</italic>) mutants, which showed significantly reduced regrowth but had no extensive sprouting (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2I</xref>) probably due to the lack of MT polymerization at the injury site (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Ghosh-Roy et al., 2012</xref>). DLK-1 is a dual leucine zipper MAPKKK essential for MT growth in regeneration.

Although 40% of the animals were able to reconnect the proximal axons with the distal segment, the regrowth length was shorter than the wild-type animals (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2I–J</xref>). Moreover, a highly branched tree-like structure was seen at the regrowth site. It appears that the regrowth had no clear direction. The regrowing axon extended multiple short processes towards different directions, but none of these processes developed into a prominent axon. One possible explanation is that the hyperstable MTs led to excessive neurite outgrowth and failure to properly respond to guidance cues during regeneration. Interestingly, another <italic>mec-7</italic> neomorphic allele that caused a P220S substitution also showed defects in axonal regeneration due to hyperstable MTs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Kirszenblat et al., 2013</xref>).

All TRN neurites were severely shortened in these mutants with K252R showing a stronger phenotype than K252Q mutants.

Our findings with the acetyl-mimicking K252Q mutants supported this hypothesis, but the K252R results are rather unexpected, as this mutation in theory would not affect the amino acid charge at that position.

Changing all seven amino acids to alanine resulted in similar phenotypes. There are four glutamic acid residues in MEC-12 C-terminal tail and three of them are in the last seven amino acids; these residues are potential sites for polyglutamylation. Mutating any of them to alanine could induce the growth of ALM-PN and converting all to alanine produced the strongest phenotype, suggesting that their functions are additive (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5A–B</xref>). Deleting the glutamic acid residues produced similar effects as changing them to alanine.

Whether these PTMs are simply markers for mature neurons or carry important functions during neuronal differentiation is not entirely clear. In this study, we established an in vivo model to test the functional relevance of tubulin PTM by editing the endogenous loci of neuron type-specific tubulin genes to install PTM-mimicking or nonmodifiable mutations. Leveraging the ease of genetic engineering in <italic>C. elegans</italic> and the simple morphology and functional readout of the mechanosensory TRNs, we investigated the role of several tubulin PTMs in axonal growth and regeneration at the single-cell level. In general, two large categories of tubulin PTMs were found (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8">Figure 8</xref>). One category, such as β-tubulin S172 phosphorylation and K252 acetylation, has strong impact on neuronal morphogenesis by affecting the incorporation of tubulin heterodimers; the other category, such as tubulin polyglutamylation and detyrosintion, has subtle effects on neurite development likely by altering the interaction between MTs and MAPs. One clear theme that stemmed from these analyses is that normal neuronal development requires an optimal level of tubulin PTMs. Either the complete absence or the excessive accumulation of tubulin PTMs would cause developmental defects.</p><fig id="fig8" position="float"><label>Figure 8.</label><caption><title>Summary of the phenotypes of the tubulin PTM site mutants.</title><p>Cartoons represent the morphologies of the ALM and PLM neurons in various <italic>mec-7</italic> and <italic>mec-12</italic> mutants.

Both mutations impaired axonal regeneration and caused defects in MT-dependent cargo transport. Previous studies found that S172-phosphorylated tubulin dimers cannot be incorporated into growing MTs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Fourest-Lieuvin et al., 2006</xref>). The fact that S172E mutants showed an antimorphic gain-of-function phenotype (indicated by severe neurite growth defects) instead of a loss-of-function phenotype (moderate growth defects found in S172P and <italic>mec-7(-</italic>) mutants) suggested that hyperphosphorylation did not simply inactivate the tubulin but produced dominant-negative effects. We suspect that MEC-7(S172E) proteins may form non-functional heterodimers with all α-tubulin isotypes expressed in TRNs and thus disabling all tubulins from polymerization, causing strong phenotypes. In contrast, the lack of MEC-7 in the deletion mutants may be partly compensated by other β-tubulin isotypes, resulting in a less severe phenotype.</p><p><italic>mec-7</italic>/β-tubulin K252 acetylation serves as another example for the requirement of optimal PTM levels, as both the acetyl-mimicking K252Q and the unmodifiable K252R mutants caused antimorphic phenotypes. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Chu et al., 2011</xref> previously found that acetylation of K252 slowed down tubulin incorporation into MTs, which is consistent with the K252Q phenotype. But the stronger defects in K252R mutants suggested that the complete elimination of K252 acetylation may cause more severe consequence on MT stability. Nevertheless, we could not rule out the possibility that K252R mutation induced structural changes of tubulin heterodimer independently of disabling K252 acetylation.</p></sec><sec id="s3-2"><title>α-tubulin K40 acetylation has little effects on neuronal differentiation</title><p>Although α-tubulin K40 acetylation serves as a marker for stable MTs in neurons, whether its relationship with MT stability is correlative or causative remains elusive.

For example, in vitro studies in a recombinant system found that the motility of kinesin motors were regulated by polyglutamylation, and the length of the glutamate side chain determined the type of kinesin motor that were activated (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib55">Sirajuddin et al., 2014</xref>). Similarly, detyrosination enhanced the interaction with kinesin-2 and kinesin-7 motor proteins, thus increasing their motility and processivity on MTs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Barisic et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib55">Sirajuddin et al., 2014</xref>). In our studies, we found that eliminating polyglutamylation or installing permanent detyrosination through the editing of α-tubulin locus increased MT stability and caused ectopic neurite growth. Genetic studies suggested that these effects are likely caused by reduced interaction with the MT-depolymerizing kinesin-13 motor protein, since the loss of kinesin-13 generated similar phenotypes, which were not enhanced by the tubulin PTM mutations. Moreover, our results are consistent with previous findings that kinesin-13 and polyglutamylation function in the same pathway to restrict axonal regeneration (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Ghosh-Roy et al., 2012</xref>), while detyrosination was known to reduce the interaction with kinesin-13 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib44">Peris et al., 2009</xref>). Thus, at least in <italic>C. elegans</italic> TRNs, both polyglutamylation and tyrosination seem to promote MT dynamics by enhancing the recruitment of kinesin-13.

So, the higher abundance of α-tubulin polyglutamylation may explain the stronger effects. Alternatively, it is also possible that glutamylation on the C-terminal tail of the α-tubulin had stronger structural influences on kinesin-13 binding compared to the modification of the β-tubulin.</p><p>However, the enzymes that mediate polyglutamylation and tyrosination in the TRNs remain elusive.

Only the regrowth cases were used to calculate the average regrowth length, which is the length of the longest regenerative branch from the cut site. About 20 regrowth case were analyzed for each strain.</p></sec><sec id="s4-5"><title>Microtubule dynamics analysis</title><p>Day-one adult animals expressing <italic>ebp-2::GFP</italic> in the TRNs were immobilized as stated above and imaged with 500 ms exposure continuously for 60 s (i.e. one frame every 529ms and 115 frames in total were collected). ImageJ was used to generate kymographs by placing a 50 μm ROI on PLM-AN starting from the cell body, and the number of EBP comets in the distal 30 μm segment were counted for quantification (we found the 20 μm proximal segment near the cell body sometimes contained many very short EBP comets, obscuring the counting). To increase MT dynamics in some strains, we used a mild colchicine treatment previously reported (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Hsu et al., 2014</xref>). L4 animals were first transferred to seeded NGM plates containing 0.125 mM colchicine and grown on these plates for 6.5 hours before being transferred back to normal NGM plates for recovery. After a one-hour recovery, the animals were mounted for video recording. In general, 15–20 animals were recorded and analyzed for each strain across multiple days.</p></sec><sec id="s4-6"><title>Recombinant proteins and kinase assays</title><p>Recombinant <italic>C. elegans</italic> MEC-12/MEC-7 tubulin dimers and MBK-2 kinase were produced in insect cells using the baculovirus-insect protein expression system. The <italic>Spodoptera frugiperda</italic> Sf9 cells (Thermo Fisher #11496015) were used to generate and propagate recombinant baculoviruses, and the <italic>Trichoplusia ni</italic> ovary High Five cells (Thermo Fisher #B85502) were used for protein expression. For the tubulins, the cDNA sequences encoding MEC-12 and MEC-7 were codon-optimized for expression in High Five cells, and the recombinant tubulin heterodimer were generated using a previously published protocol (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib58">Ti et al., 2020</xref>).</p><p>For MBK-2, we cloned the cDNA of the <italic>m</italic> isoform of MBK-2 (NP_001293914.1) into the pACEBac1 vector and infected the High Five cells with P3 virus. About 60 hr after the infection, cells were harvested by centrifugation (1000 × <italic>g</italic>, 15 min) and lysed in lysis buffer (50 mM Tris-HCl, 20 mM imidazole, 500 mM KCl, 1 mM MgCl<sub>2</sub>, 0.5 mM β-mercaptoethanol, 1 mM ATP, 1% IGEPAL, 5% glycerol, 3 U/ml Benzonase and Roche Complete EDTA-free protease inhibitor, pH 8.0) using dounce homogenization (20 strokes) on ice or at 4 °C. The extracts were clarified by centrifugation at 55,000 rpm for 1 hr. Supernatant was then filtered through the 0.22 µm Millex-GP PES membrane (Millipore) and loaded onto HisTrap HP column. After washing the HisTrap HP column with lysis buffer till the absorbance at 280 nm reaches the baseline, the bound protein was eluted with elution buffer (25 mM Tris-HCl, 250 mM imidazole, 500 mM KCl, 1 mM MgCl<sub>2</sub>, 2 mM β-mercaptoethanol, 1 mM ATP, 5% glycerol, pH 8.0).

The dialyzed protein solution was then loaded onto HisTrap HP and HiTrap Q FF columns. After washing the columns with low-salt buffer, the HisTrap HP column was disconnected, and the HiTrap Q FF column was eluted with a 0–100% gradient to the high-salt buffer (25 mM Tris-HCl, 20 mM imidazole, 500 mM KCl, 1 mM MgCl<sub>2</sub>, 2 mM β-mercaptoethanol, 1 mM ATP, 5% glycerol, pH 8.0).

After washing twice with Tris-Triton Buffer (TTB; 100 mM Tris-HCl pH 7.4, 1% Triton X-100, 1 mM EDTA), worms were treated with 1% β-mercaptoethanol in TTB at 37 °C with gentle agitation for 4 hr. Samples were then washed with Borate buffer (25 mM H<sub>3</sub>BO<sub>3</sub>, 25 mM NaOH, pH 9.2) and incubated in borate buffer with 10 mM DTT at 37 °C and in borate buffer with 0.3% H<sub>2</sub>O<sub>2</sub> at room temperature, sequentially; each incubation lasted 15 min under agitation and was followed by a wash using borate buffer. At this stage, worms were permeable to macromolecules due to the reduction of cuticular disulfide bonds to -SH and the subsequent oxidation of -SH to -SO<sub>3</sub>. Permeabilized worms were then blocked with Antibody Buffer (PBST containing 1% BSA and 1 mM EDTA) for 1 hr and incubated with antibodies at a 1:100 (for primary antibody) or 1:1000 (for secondary antibodies) dilution in Antibody Buffer for 2 hr. Three washes with shaking for a total of 2 hr were applied after antibody incubation. The staining signal in at least 40 animals were quantified from each strain.</p><p>Antibodies used in this study included the anti-phospho-S172 (abcam; #ab76286), anti-acetyl-K40 (abcam; #ab24610), anti-polyE GT335 (AdipoGen Life Science; #AG-20B-0020-C100), anti-polyE chain IN105 (AdipoGen; #AG-25B-0030-C050), anti-glycylated tubulin Gly-pep1 (AdipoGen; #AG-25B-0034-C100), anti-tyrosinated α-tubulin (Sigma; #MAB1864-I), anti-detyrosinated α-tubulin (Sigma; #MAB5566), and fluorophore-labeled secondary antibodies from Thermo Fisher (#A32723 and #A11006) and Jackson ImmunoResearch (#115-025-164, #111-545-003, #111-025-003, and #115-545-003).</p></sec><sec id="s4-8"><title>In vitro culture of <italic>C. elegans</italic> embryonic cells</title><p><italic>C. elegans</italic> embryos were collected from gravid adults through a bleaching procedure, washed with M9 buffer and then egg buffer (118 mM NaCl, 48 mM KCl, 3.4 mM CaCl2, 3.4 mM MgCl2, 5 mM Hepes, pH 7.4), and incubated in egg buffer (1 ml per 100 µl egg pellet) supplemented with 0.5% chitinase (Sigma #C6137) for ~20 min until the eggshells were dissolved. Digested embryos were washed in egg buffer twice and subsequently in L-15CM medium [Leibovitz’s L-15 Medium (Thermo Fisher #11415064) supplemented with 10% FBS, 100 U/ml penicillin-streptomycin (Sigma; P4333), and 0.85% sucrose].

However, most studies investigating the roles of tubulin PTMs have been conducted in vitro either with purified components or in cultured cells. Lu et al. use CRISPR/Cas9 genome editing to mutate tubulin genes in <italic>C. elegans</italic>, testing the role of specific tubulin residues on neuronal development. This study is a real tour de force, tackling multiple proposed tubulin modifications and following the resulting phenotypes with respect to neurite outgrowth in vivo. There is a ton of data that experts in the field will likely reference for years to come as this is one of the most comprehensive in vivo analyses of tubulin PTMs in vivo.</p><p>This paper will be very important to the field, however, it would be strengthened if: (1) the authors demonstrated that the mutations they introduced had the intended consequences on microtubule PTMs, (2) the authors explored how the various tubulin mutations directly affect microtubules, and (3) the findings are made generally more accessible to non <italic>C. elegans</italic> neurobiologist.</p><p>(1) The authors introduce several mutations to perturb tubulin PTMs, However, it is unclear to what extent the engineered mutations affecting tubulin in the intended way. i.e. are the authors sure that the PTMs they want to perturb are actually present in <italic>C. elegans</italic>. Many of the antibodies used did not appear to be specific and antibody staining was not always impacted in the mutant cases as expected. For example, is there any evidence that S172 is phosphorylated in <italic>C. elegans</italic>, e.g. from available phosphor-proteomic data? Given the significant amount of staining left in the S172A mutant, the antibody seems non-specific in this context and therefore not a reliable readout of whether MTs are actually phosphorylated at this residue. As another example, there is no evidence presented that K252 is acetylated in <italic>C. elegans</italic>. At the very least, the authors should consider demonstrating the conservation of these residues and the surrounding residues with other organisms where studies have demonstrated PTMs exist.</p><p>(2) Given that the authors have the mutants in hand, it would be incredibly valuable to assess the impact of these mutations on microtubules directly in all cases. MT phenotypes are inferred from neurite outgrowth phenotypes in several cases, the authors should look directly at microtubules and/or microtubule dynamics via EBP-2 when possible OR show evidence that the only way to derive the neurite phenotypes shown is through the inferred microtubule phenotypes. For example, the effect of the acetylation or detyrosination mutants on MTs was not assessed.</p><p>(3) There is a ton of data here that will be important for experts working in this field to dig into, however, for the more general cell biologist, some of the data are quite inaccessible. More cartoons and better labeling will be helpful as will consistent comparisons to control worms in each experiment. A good example of this issue is demonstrated in Figure 2 and Figure 4:</p><p>- Fig. 2: Please label images with what is being probed in each panel</p><p>- Fig 2G is very hard to interpret-cartoon diagramming what is being observed would be helpful.</p><p>- Line 182-185: is this referring to your data or to Wu et al? It is not clear in this paragraph when the authors are describing published work versus their own data presented here.</p><p>- Fig 2!-2K is not well described. What experiment is being done here? What is dlk-1 and why did you look at this mutant?</p><p>- Figure 4C: this phenotype is hard to interpret. Where is the wt control? Where is the quantification?</p><p>- There are no WT comparison images in Figure 4I, making the quantification difficult to interpret</p><p>(4) In addition, I am left unconvinced of the negative data demonstrating that MBK does not phosphorylate tubulin. First, the data described in lines 207-211 does not appear to be presented anywhere. Second, RNAi is notoriously finicky in neurons, thus necessitating tissue specific degradation using either the ZF/ZIF-1 or AID/TIR1 systems which both work extremely well in <italic>C. elegans</italic>. Third, there appears to be increasing S172 phosphorylation in Figure 3 supplement 2 with added MBK-2, but there is no anti-tubulin blot to show equal loading, so this experiment is hard to interpret.</p></body></sub-article><sub-article article-type="author-comment" id="sa2"><front-stub><article-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.94583.3.sa2</article-id><title-group><article-title>Author response</article-title></title-group><contrib-group><contrib contrib-type="author"><name><surname>Lu</surname><given-names>Yu-Ming</given-names></name><role specific-use="author">Author</role><aff><institution>University of Hong Kong</institution><addr-line><named-content content-type="city">Hong Kong</named-content></addr-line><country>Hong Kong</country></aff></contrib><contrib contrib-type="author"><name><surname>Yan</surname><given-names>Shan</given-names></name><role specific-use="author">Author</role><aff><institution>University of Hong Kong</institution><addr-line><named-content content-type="city">Hong Kong</named-content></addr-line><country>Hong Kong</country></aff></contrib><contrib contrib-type="author"><name><surname>Ti</surname><given-names>Shih-Chieh</given-names></name><role specific-use="author">Author</role><aff><institution>The University of Hong Kong</institution><addr-line><named-content content-type="city">Hong Kong</named-content></addr-line><country>Hong Kong</country></aff></contrib><contrib contrib-type="author"><name><surname>Zheng</surname><given-names>Chaogu</given-names></name><role specific-use="author">Author</role><aff><institution>University of Hong Kong</institution><addr-line><named-content content-type="city">Hong Kong</named-content></addr-line><country>Hong Kong</country></aff></contrib></contrib-group></front-stub><body><p>The following is the authors’ response to the original reviews.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p><bold>Public Reviews:</bold></p><p><bold>Reviewer #1 (Public Review):</bold></p><p>(1) The manuscript by Lu et al aims to study the effects of tubulin post-translational modification in <italic>C. elegans</italic> touch receptor neurons. Authors use gene editing to engineer various predicted PTM mutations in a-tubulin MEC-12 and b-tubulin MEC-7. Authors generate and analyze an impressive battery of mutants in predicted phosphorylation site and acetylation site of b-tubulin MEC-7, K40 acetylation site in a-tubulin MEC-12, enzymatic site of the a-tubulin acetyltransferase MEC-17, and PTM sites in the MEC-12 and MEC-7 C-tails (glutamylation, detyrosination, delta-tubulin). This represents a lot of work, and will appeal to a readership interested in <italic>C. elegans</italic> touch receptor neurons. The major concern/criticism of this manuscript is whether the introduced mutation(s) directly affects a specific PTM or whether the mutation affects gene expression, protein expression/stability/localization, etc. As such, this work does convincingly demonstrate, as stated in the title, that &quot;Editing of endogenous tubulins reveals varying effects of tubulin posttranslational modifications on axonal growth and regeneration.&quot;</p></disp-quote><p>We thank the reviewer for the constructive comments. With regards to the major concern or criticism, we like to point out that we have previously characterized ~100 missense mutations in <italic>mec-7</italic> and <italic>mec-12</italic> (Zheng et al., 2017, PMID: 28835377; Lee et al., 2021, PMID: 33378215). So, we are familiar with the phenotypes associated with mutations that affect gene expression or protein stability, which mostly result in a null phenotype. When analyzing the PTM site mutants, we compared their phenotypes with the previously categorized phenotypes of null alleles, neomorphic mutations that increase microtubule stability, and antimorphic mutations that prevent polymerization or disrupt microtubule stability. For example, in the case of <italic>mec-7</italic> S172 mutations, we found that S172P mutants had the same phenotype as the <italic>mec-7</italic> knockout (mild neurite growth defects), suggesting that S172P likely affects protein folding or stability, resulting in the loss of MEC-7. In contrast, S172A and S172E mutations showed phenotypes similar to neomorphic alleles (the emergence of ectopic ALM posterior neurite) and antimorphic alleles (the severe shortening of all neurites in the TRNs), respectively. These phenotypic differences suggested to us that the effects of S172A and S172E mutations cannot be simply attributed to the loss of protein expression and stability. Similar logic was applied to the studies of other PTM-inactivating or -mimicking mutations.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>(2) For example, the authors manipulate the C-terminal tail of MEC-12 and MEC-7, to test the idea that polyglutamylation may be an important PTM. These mutants displayed subtle phenotypes. The authors show that branch point GT335 and polyglutamyation polyE recognizing antibodies stain cultured embryonic touch receptor neurons (TRNs), but did not examine staining in <italic>C. elegans</italic> TRNs in situ. To my knowledge, these antibodies have not been shown to stain the TRNs in any published papers, raising the question of how these &quot;glutamylation&quot; mutations are affecting mec-12 and -7. The rationale for using cultured embryonic TRNs and the relevance of the data and its interpretation are not clear.</p></disp-quote><p>The GT335 and polyE antibodies were used by previous studies (O’Hagan et al., 2011, PMID: 21982591; and O’Hagan et al., 2017, PMID: 29129530) to detect the polyglutamylation signals in the sensory cilia of <italic>C. elegans</italic>. We initially tried to stain the whole animals using these antibodies but could not get clear and distinct signals in the TRNs. We reason that the tubulin polyglutamylation signals in the TRNs may be weak, and the in situ staining method which requires the antibodies to penetrate multiple layers of tissues (e.g., cuticles and epidermis) to reach the TRN axons may be not sensitive enough to detect the signal. In fact, the TRN axons are located deeper in the worm body compared to the sensory cilia that are mostly exposed to the environment. Another reason could be that the tissues (mostly epidermis) surrounding the TRN axons also have polyglutamylation staining, which makes it difficult to recognize TRN axons. This is a situation different from the anti-K40 acetylation staining, which only occurs in the TRNs because MEC-12 is the only a-tubulin isotype that carries K40. Due to these technical difficulties, we decided to use the in vitro cultured TRNs for the staining experiment, which allows both easy access of the antibodies (thus higher sensitivity) and the dissociation of the TRNs from other tissues. The fact that we were able to observe reduced staining in the <italic>ttll</italic> mutants and the tubulin mutants that lost the glutamate residues suggest that these antibodies indeed detected glutamylation signals in the cells.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>(3) The final paragraph of the discussion is factually incorrect.

We intended to say that “there is no <italic>C. elegans</italic> homolog of the known tubulin carboxypeptidases that catalyze detyrosination”, which is true given that the detyrosinase vasohibins (VASH1/VASH2) homologs cannot be found in <italic>C. elegans</italic>. We are aware of the publications on CCPP-1 and CCPP-6; CCPP-1 is known to regulate tubulin deglutamylation in the cilia of <italic>C. elegans</italic> (O’Hagan et al., 2011 and 2017), while CCPP-6 may function in the PLM to regulate axonal regeneration (Ghosh-Roy et al., 2012). In the revised manuscript, we have corrected the error.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p><bold>Reviewer #2 (Public Review):</bold></p><p>Summary:</p><p>The tubulin subunits that make up microtubules can be posttranslationally modified and these PTMs are proposed to regulate microtubule dynamics and the proteins that can interact with microtubules in many contexts. However, most studies investigating the roles of tubulin PTMs have been conducted in vitro either with purified components or in cultured cells. Lu et al. use CRISPR/Cas9 genome editing to mutate tubulin genes in <italic>C. elegans</italic>, testing the role of specific tubulin residues on neuronal development. This study is a real tour de force, tackling multiple proposed tubulin modifications and following the resulting phenotypes with respect to neurite outgrowth in vivo. There is a ton of data that experts in the field will likely reference for years to come as this is one of the most comprehensive in vivo analyses of tubulin PTMs in vivo.</p><p>This paper will be very important to the field, however would be strengthened if: (1) the authors demonstrated that the mutations they introduced had the intended consequences on microtubule PTMs, (2) the authors explored how the various tubulin mutations directly affect microtubules, and (3) the findings are made generally more accessible to non <italic>C. elegans</italic> neurobiologists.</p><p>(1) The authors introduce several mutations to perturb tubulin PTMs, However, it is unclear to what extent the engineered mutations affect tubulin in the intended way i.e. are the authors sure that the PTMs they want to perturb are actually present in <italic>C. elegans</italic>. Many of the antibodies used did not appear to be specific and antibody staining was not always impacted in the mutant cases as expected. For example, is there any evidence that S172 is phosphorylated in <italic>C. elegans</italic>, e.g. from available phosphor-proteomic data? Given the significant amount of staining left in the S172A mutant, the antibody seems non-specific in this context and therefore not a reliable readout of whether MTs are actually phosphorylated at this residue. As another example, there is no evidence presented that K252 is acetylated in <italic>C. elegans</italic>. At the very least, the authors should consider demonstrating the conservation of these residues and the surrounding residues with other organisms where studies have demonstrated PTMs exist.</p></disp-quote><p>We thank the reviewer for the comments. To our knowledge, there are very few phosphor-proteome data available for <italic>C. elegans</italic>. We searched a previously published dataset (Zielinska et al., 2009; PMID: 19530675) and did not find the S172 phosphorylation signal in MEC-7. This is not surprising, given that only six touch receptor neurons expressed MEC-7 and the abundance of MEC-7 in the whole animal lysate may be below the detection limit. However, this phosphorylation site S172 is highly conserved across species and tubulin isotypes (Figure 1-figure supplement 1 in the revised manuscript), suggesting that this site is likely phosphorylated in MEC-7.</p><p>In the case of K252, the potential acetylation site and the flanking sequences are extremely conserved across species and isotypes. In fact, the 20 amino acids from 241-260 a.a. are identical among the tubulin genes of <italic>C. elegans,</italic> fruit flies, Xenopus, and humans (Figure 4-figure supplement 1B). Thus, although K252 acetylation was found in the HeLa cells, this site can possibly be acetylated.</p><p>In the case of K40, we observed sequence divergence at the PTM site and adjacent sequences among the tubulin isotypes in <italic>C. elegans</italic>. MEC-12 is the only <italic>C. elegans</italic> a-tubulin isotype that has the K40 residue, and the 40-50 a.a. region of MEC-12 appears to be more conserved than other isotypes when compared to <italic>Drosophila</italic>, frog, and human a-tubulins (Figure 4-figure supplement 1A).</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>(2) Given that the authors have the mutants in hand, it would be incredibly valuable to assess the impact of these mutations on microtubules directly in all cases. MT phenotypes are inferred from neurite outgrowth phenotypes in several cases, the authors should look directly at microtubules and/or microtubule dynamics via EBP-2 when possible OR show evidence that the only way to derive the neurite phenotypes shown is through the inferred microtubule phenotypes. For example, the effect of the acetylation or detyrosination mutants on MTs was not assessed.</p></disp-quote><p>We thank the reviewer for the suggestions. In this study, we created &gt;20 tubulin mutants. Due to limited time and resources, we were not able to examine microtubule dynamics in every mutant strain using EBP-2 kymographs. We assessed the effects of the tubulin mutations mostly based on the changes on neurite growth pattern. From our previous experience of analyzing ~100 <italic>mec-7</italic> and <italic>mec-12</italic> missense mutations (Zheng et al., 2017, MBoC; Lee et al., 2021, MBoC), we found that the changes in microtubule dynamics are correlated with the changes in neuronal morphologies. For example, the growth of ectopic ALM-PN is correlated with fewer EBP-2 comets and potentially reduced microtubule dynamics; this correlation holds true for several <italic>mec-7</italic> neomorphic missense alleles we examined before (Lee et al., 2021, MBoC) and the PTM site mutants [e.g., <italic>mec-7(S172A)</italic> and <italic>mec-12(4Es-A)</italic>] analyzed in this study. Similarly, the shortening of TRN neurites is correlated with more EBP-2 comets and increased microtubule dynamics. For the mutants that don’t show neurite growth defects, our previous experience is that they are not likely to show altered microtubule dynamics in EBP-2 tracking experiments. So, we did not analyze the acetylation mutants (which had no defects in neurite growth) and the detyrosination mutants (which had weak ALM-PN phenotype). Nevertheless, we agree with the reviewer that we could not rule out the possibility that there may be some slight changes to microtubule dynamics in these mutants.</p><p>Using tannic acid staining and electron microscopy (EM), we previously examined the microtubule structure in several tubulin missense mutants (Zheng et al., 2017, MBoC) and found that the loss-of-function and antimorphic mutations significantly reduced the number of microtubules and altered microtubule organizations by reducing protofilament numbers. These structural changes are consistent with highly unstable microtubules and defects in neurite growth. On the other hand, neomorphic mutants had only slight decrease in microtubule abundance, maintained the 15-protofilament structure, and had a more tightly packed microtubule bundles that filled up most of the space in the TRN neurite (Zheng et al., 2017, MBoC). These structural features are consistent with increased microtubule stability and ectopic neurite growth. Although we did not directly examine the microtubule abundance and structure using EM in this study, we would expect similar changes that are correlated with the neurite growth phenotypes in the PTM mutants. We agree with the reviewer, it will be informative to conduct more comprehensive analysis on these mutants using EM and other structural biology methods.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>(3) There is a ton of data here that will be important for experts working in this field to dig into, however, for the more general cell biologist, some of the data are quite inaccessible. More cartoons and better labeling will be helpful as will consistent comparisons to control worms in each experiment.</p></disp-quote><p>Response: We thank the reviewer for the comment. In the revised manuscript, we added some cartoons to Figure 2G to show the location of the synaptic vesicles. The neurite growth phenotype should be quite straightforward. Nevertheless, we added one more Figure (Figure 8) to summarize all the results in the study with cartoons that depicted the changes to neuronal morphologies.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>(4) In addition, I am left unconvinced of the negative data demonstrating that MBK does not phosphorylate tubulin. First, the data described in lines 207-211 does not appear to be presented anywhere. Second, RNAi is notoriously finicky in neurons, thus necessitating tissue-specific degradation using either the ZF/ZIF-1 or AID/TIR1 systems which both work extremely well in <italic>C. elegans</italic>. Third, there appears to be increasing S172 phosphorylation in Figure 3 Supplement 2 with added MBK-2, but there is no anti-tubulin blot to show equal loading, so this experiment is hard to interpret.</p></disp-quote><p>We added the results of <italic>mbk-1</italic>, <italic>mbk-2</italic>, and <italic>hpk-1</italic> mutants and cell-specific knockdown of MBK-2 into Figure 3-figure supplement 1D. Considering the reviewer’s suggestion, we attempted to use a ZIF-1 system to remove the MBK-2 proteins specifically in the TRNs using a previously published method (PMID: 28619826). We fused endogenous MBK-2 with GFP by gene editing and then expressed an anti-GFP nanobodies fused with ZIF-1 in the TRNs to induce the degradation of MBK-2::GFP. To our surprise, unlike the <italic>mbk-2p::GFP</italic> transcriptional reporter, the MBK-2::GFP did not show detectable expression in the TRNs, although expression can be seen in early embryos, which is consistent with the “embryonic lethal” phenotype of the <italic>mbk-2(-)</italic> mutants (Figure 3-figure supplement 2A-B in the revised manuscript). We reason that either endogenous MBK-2 is not expressed in the TRNs or is expressed at a very low level. We then crossed <italic>mbk-2::GFP</italic> with <italic>ItSi953 [mec-18p::vhhGFP4::Zif-1]</italic> to trigger the degradation of any potential MBK-2 proteins and did not observe the ectopic growth of ALM-PN (Figure 3- figure supplement 2C). These results suggest that MBK-2 is not likely to regulate tubulin phosphorylation in the TRNs, which is consistent with the results of other genetic mutants and the RNAi experiments.</p><p>For Figure 3 Supplement 2 (Figure 3-figuer supplement 3 in revised manuscript), because we added the same amount of purified MEC-12/MEC-7 to all reactions and had established equal loading in Figure 3E, we did not do the anti-tubulin staining in this experiment. Since higher concentration (1742 nM) of MBK-2 did not produce stronger signal than the condition with 1268 nM, we don’t think the 1268 nM band represents true phosphorylation. Moreover, the signal is not significantly stronger than the control without MBK-2 and is much lower than the signal generated by CDK1 in Figure 3E. Based on these results, we concluded that MBK-2 is not likely to phosphorylate MEC-7.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p><bold>Recommendations for the authors:</bold></p><p><bold>Reviewer #1 (Recommendations For The Authors):</bold></p><p>General:</p><p>A summary table would help the reader digest the vast amount of phenotypic data.</p><p>Cartoons to help a non-<italic>C. elegans</italic> reader understand the figures.</p></disp-quote><p>We added Figure 8 to summarize and illustrate the effects of the various mutants analyzed in this study.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Specific:</p><p>The authors engineered mutations into the predicted phosphorylation site of b-tubulin mec-7. These CRISPR-alleles mutations phenocopied previously identified loss-of-function, gain-of-function, and neomorphic mec-7 alleles identified in genetic screens by the Chalfie lab. Next, the authors sought to identify the responsible kinase, taking a candidate gene approach. The most likely family - minibrain - had no effect when knocked down/out. The authors showed that cdk-1 mutants displayed ectopic ALM-PN outgrowth. Whether cdk-1 specifically acts in the TRNs was not demonstrated, calling into question whether CDK-1 phosphorylates S172 in vivo. In their introduction (lines 45-59), the authors built a case for engineering PTM mutations directly into tubulins, because the PTM enzymes may have multiple substrates. This logic applies to the cdk-1 experiment and its interpretation.</p></disp-quote><p>The reviewer is right. Since CDK1 and minibrain kinase are the only known kinases that catalyze S172 phosphorylation, our results suggest that CDK-1 is more likely to catalyze S172 phosphorylation in the TRNs compared to MBK-1/2. Genetic studies found that <italic>cdk-1(-); mec-7(S172A)</italic> double mutants did not show stronger phenotype than the two single mutants, suggesting that they function in the same pathway. Nevertheless, we could not rule out the possibility that other kinases may also control S172 phosphorylation, and the effect of CDK-1 is indirect. We mentioned this possibility in the revised manuscript.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>For a-tubulin MEC-12, acetyl-mimicking K40Q and unmodifiable K40R mutants failed to stain with the anti-acetyl-a-tubulin (K40) antibody and displayed subtle TRN phenotypes. The enzymatically dead MEC-17 had phenotypes similar to those described by Topalidou (2012), confirming the Chalfie lab finding that MEC-17 has functions in addition and independent of its acetyltransferase activity. The authors moved onto a predicted acetylation site in MEC-7 and observed TRN developmental defects, and acknowledged that this may be due to tubulin instability and not a PTM. This is a concern for all mutants, as there is no way to measure whether the protein is expressed, stable, or localized properly.</p></disp-quote><p>We acknowledge that this is a caveat of mutational studies. An amino acid substitution at the PTM site may have multiple effects, including the change of the PTM state and potential alteration of protein conformation. Without direct evidence for enzymatic modification of the PTM site in the neurons, we could not rule out the possibility the phenotype we observed is not related to PTM and instead is the result of abnormal protein conformation and function caused by the mutation.</p><p>Nevertheless, as stated in our above response to the first point in the public review, we can phenotypically differentiate loss-of-function and gain-of-function mutants. If the mutation reduces expression or general protein stability, it is more likely to cause a loss-of-function phenotype. For most PTM site mutants, this is not the case. We observed mostly gain-of-function phenotype, suggesting that the missense mutations did not simply inactivate the tubulin protein and instead affected the functional properties of the protein.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>From here, the authors manipulate the C-terminal tail of MEC-12 and MEC-7, testing the idea that polyglutamylation may be an important PTM.
