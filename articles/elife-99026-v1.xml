A comprehensive picture of native co-localized G4s and R-loops in living cells is currently lacking. Here, we describe the development of HepG4-seq and an optimized HBD-seq methods, which robustly capture native G4s and R-loops, respectively, in living cells. We successfully employed these methods to establish comprehensive maps of native co-localized G4s and R-loops in human HEK293 cells and mouse embryonic stem cells (mESCs). We discovered that co-localized G4s and R-loops are dynamically altered in a cell type-dependent manner and are largely localized at active promoters and enhancers of transcriptional active genes. We further demonstrated the helicase Dhx9 as a direct and major regulator that modulates the formation and resolution of co-localized G4s and R-loops. Depletion of Dhx9 impaired the self-renewal and differentiation capacities of mESCs by altering the transcription of co-localized G4s and R-loops -associated genes. Taken together, our work established that the endogenous co-localized G4s and R-loops are prevalently persisted in the regulatory regions of active genes and are involved in the transcriptional regulation of their linked genes, opening the door for exploring broader roles of co-localized G4s and R-loops in development and disease.</p></abstract><kwd-group kwd-group-type="author-keywords"><kwd>native G-quadruplex</kwd><kwd>native R-loop</kwd><kwd>HepG4-seq</kwd><kwd>HBD-seq</kwd><kwd>Dhx9</kwd><kwd>co-localized G4s</kwd><kwd>R-loops</kwd></kwd-group><kwd-group kwd-group-type="research-organism"><title>Research organism</title><kwd>Human</kwd><kwd>Mouse</kwd></kwd-group><funding-group><award-group id="fund1"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100013290</institution-id><institution>National Key Research and Development Program of China Stem Cell and Translational Research</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>2018YFA0109200</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Xue</surname><given-names>Zhihong</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund2"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution>Project for Cultivating Leading Talent in Science and Technology of Sichuan University</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>0082604151357</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Xue</surname><given-names>Zhihong</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund3"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100010031</institution-id><institution>Postdoctoral Research Foundation of China</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>2018M643467</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Yu</surname><given-names>Lin</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><funding-statement>The funders had no role in study design, data collection and interpretation, or the decision to submit the work for publication.</funding-statement></funding-group><custom-meta-group><custom-meta specific-use="meta-only"><meta-name>Author impact statement</meta-name><meta-value>The newly developed antibody-free techniques, HepG4-seq for G-quadruplexes and HBD-seq for R-loops, robustly reveal the comprehensive maps of native G-quadruplexes and R-loops, as well as their roles in transcriptional regulation.</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta specific-use="meta-only"><meta-name>publishing-route</meta-name><meta-value>prc</meta-value></custom-meta></custom-meta-group></article-meta></front><body><sec id="s1" sec-type="intro"><title>Introduction</title><p>Genomic DNA can form various types of non-B secondary structures, including G-quadruplexes (G4s), R-loops, Z-DNA, i-motifs, Cruciform, and others (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib66">Matos-Rodrigues et al., 2023</xref>). Among them, G4s and R-loops are two of the best studied. G4s are built by stacked guanine tetrads connected via Hoogsteen hydrogen bonds and can be formed by intra- or inter-molecular folding of the tetramers (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib78">Panyutin et al., 1989</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib86">Sen and Gilbert, 1988</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib90">Sundquist and Klug, 1989</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib97">Williamson et al., 1989</xref>). R-loops are three-stranded structures containing a DNA-RNA hybrid and a displaced single-stranded DNA (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Aguilera and García-Muse, 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib99">Xu and Clayton, 1996</xref>). Both G4s and R-loops are involved in key biological processes, including transcription, replication, genomic instability, class switch recombination in B cells, DNA damage and repair, and telomere maintenance (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">García-Muse and Aguilera, 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">Hänsel-Hertsch et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib94">Varshney et al., 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib105">Yang et al., 2023</xref>).</p><p>R-loops appear to have a strong sequence preference with high G/C ratios (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Ginno et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">Ginno et al., 2012</xref>). Reports about the interplay between R-loops and G4s are emerging. Specific G4 ligands stabilized G4s and simultaneously increase R-loop levels within minutes in human cancer cells, which finally induced DNA damage (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">De Magis et al., 2019</xref>). Reactive oxygen species (ROS) have been reported to induce G4 and R-loop formation at transcriptionally active sites, and their inter-regulation is essential for the DNA repair (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib92">Tan et al., 2020</xref>). In a reconstituted eukaryotic DNA replication system, the interplay of R-loops and G4s was shown to impact replication fork progression by inducing fork stalling (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib53">Kumar et al., 2021</xref>). Single-molecule fluorescence studies showed the existence of a positive feedback mechanism of G4 and R-loop formation during transcription, where the transcription-induced R-loop precedes and facilitates G4 formation in the non-template strand, and in turn, G4 promotes the R-loop formation in the following rounds of transcription (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib56">Lee et al., 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib62">Lim and Hohng, 2020</xref>). Wulfridge et al. reported that the architectural protein CCCTC binding factor (CTCF)-bound sites are enriched for R-loops and G4s which facilitate CTCF binding to promote chromatin looping interactions (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib98">Wulfridge et al., 2023</xref>).</p><p>Detection of G4s and R-loops have been largely based on the use of a single-chain variable fragment (scFv) BG4 for G4s and a monoclonal antibody S9.6 for R-loops. In recent years, these two antibodies have been coupled with deep sequencing to genome-widely detect G4s and R-loops (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Galli et al., 2022</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">Ginno et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">Hänsel-Hertsch et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib46">Jiang et al., 2023</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib64">Lyu et al., 2021</xref>). Using BG4 and S9.6 -based CUT &amp; Tag, G4s, and R-loops showed a high degree of co-occurrence in mESCs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib64">Lyu et al., 2021</xref>). However, given that a group of helicases, RNA-binding factors, endonucleases, and DNA topoisomerases cooperate to actively dissolve G4s and R-loops restoring B-formed DNA duplexes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">Hänsel-Hertsch et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib94">Varshney et al., 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib105">Yang et al., 2023</xref>), a steady state equilibrium is generally set at low levels in living cells under physiological conditions (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib71">Miglietta et al., 2020</xref>) and thus the addition of high-affinity antibodies may pull the equilibrium towards folded states. Additionally, the specificity of the S9.6 antibody on R-loops has been questioned recently for accurate quantification and mapping of R-loops (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">Hartono et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib51">König et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib79">Phillips et al., 2013</xref>).</p><p>To understand the co-localized G4s and R-loops in living cells under physiological conditions, we sought to develop an in vivo strategy for G4 profiling based on the G4-hemin complex-induced proximal labeling and R-loop profiling based on the N-terminal hybrid-binding domain (HBD) of RNase H1. Recent studies showed that G4s could tightly form a complex with the cellular cofactor hemin both in vitro and in living cells, where hemin binds by end-stacking on the terminal G-quartets of G4s without affecting the folding of G4s (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">Gray et al., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib89">Stadlbauer et al., 2021</xref>). The G4-hemin complex has been shown to act as a peroxidase to catalyze oxidation reactions in the presence of hydrogen peroxide (H<sub>2</sub>O<sub>2</sub>) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Cheng et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib55">Lat et al., 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib104">Yang et al., 2011</xref>). The H<sub>2</sub>O<sub>2</sub>-activated G4-hemin complex oxidizes the biotin tyramide to phenoxyl redicals that covalently conjugate biotin to G4 itself and its proximal DNA within 10 nm (equivalent to approximately 31 bp) in vitro and in vivo (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Einarson and Sen, 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib55">Lat et al., 2020</xref>). Here, we have utilized the G4-hemin-mediated proximal biotinylation rection to develop a new method HepG4-seq (for high throughput <bold>seq</bold>uencing of <bold>he</bold>min-induced <bold>p</bold>roximal labeled <bold>G4</bold>s) to map the genomic native G4s under physiological conditions. The HBD domain of RNase H1 mediates the specific recognition of DNA/RNA hybrid in a sequence-independent manner, which is a gold standard for R-loop recognition in the cell (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib76">Nowotny et al., 2008</xref>). The catalytically inactive RNase H1 or its HBD domain -based methods have been successfully used to identify genome-wide native R-loops (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Chen et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib96">Wang et al., 2021</xref>). We have adapted the ‘GST-His6-2xHBD’-mediated CUT&amp;Tag protocol (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib96">Wang et al., 2021</xref>) to develop the HBD-seq protocol in this study.</p><p>We have combined the HepG4-seq and HBD-seq to profile the genome-wide native co-localized G4s and R-loops with high signal-to-noise ratios in HEK293 cells and mESCs. We observed that the co-localized G4s and R-loops exhibit cell type-dependent distributions and are largely localized at active promoters and enhancers of transcriptionally active genes. We further showed that ~70% of the co-localized G4s and R-loops in mESCs were directly bound by the helicase Dhx9 and that depletion of Dhx9 significantly altered the levels of ~6200 co-localized G4s and R-loops bound by Dhx9. Furthermore, depletion of Dhx9 was shown to impair the self-renewal and differentiation capacities of mESCs by altering the transcription of co-localized G4s and R-loops -associated genes.</p></sec><sec id="s2" sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><sec id="s2-1"><title>Mapping of the native DNA G4 through the G4-hemin-mediated proximal biotinylation</title><p>The DNA G4-hemin complex could act as a mimic peroxidase to oxidize the biotin tyramide to phenoxyl radicals that can covalently conjugate biotin to G4 itself and its proximal DNA within ~30 bp in the presence of H<sub>2</sub>O<sub>2</sub> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Cheng et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Einarson and Sen, 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib55">Lat et al., 2020</xref>). However, the efficiency of peroxidase-mediated biotinylation on DNA is limited using the substrate biotin tyramide (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib109">Zhou et al., 2019a</xref>). Recently, biotin aniline (Bio-An) has been shown to have superior labeling efficiency on DNA than biotin tyramide, when catalyzed by the engineered peroxidase APEX2 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib109">Zhou et al., 2019a</xref>). The free heme concentration in normal human erythrocytes is 21±2 µM (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Aich et al., 2015</xref>). To explore the G4-hemin-mediated biotinylation in the living cells, we treated HEK293 cells with 25 µM hemin and 500 µM Bio-An for 2 hr prior to activation with 1 mM H<sub>2</sub>O<sub>2</sub> for 1 min, and then quenched the labeling reaction and performed the immunofluorescence staining using Alexa Fluor 647 conjugated recombinant streptavidin (Strep-647) that specifically recognizes biotin. As shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1A</xref>, cells treated with hemin and Bio-An exhibited a robust fluorescence signal, while the absence of either hemin or Bio-An almost completely abolished the biotinylation signals, suggesting a specific and active biotinylation activity. To understand whether the addition of hemin disturbs the formation of G4s, we performed the BG4 CUT&amp;Tag-seq using the recombinant BG4 and Tn5 on HEK293 cells treated with and without 25 µM hemin (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1A, B</xref>). The heatmap and profile plot analysis showed similar BG4 CUT&amp;Tag signals between the hemin-treated and control samples (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1B</xref>). There were only 174 BG4 CUT&amp;Tag peaks with significantly differential signals between the hemin-treated and control samples (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1C</xref>). These data suggest that the hemin treatment condition we used does not significantly affect G4 folding. Therefore, hemin-induced proximal biotinylation of G4s could be utilized to mark the native G4s in living cells.</p><fig-group><fig id="fig1" position="float"><label>Figure 1.</label><caption><title>Mapping of the native DNA G-quadruplex (G4) through the G4-hemin-mediated proximal biotinylation.</title><p>(<bold>A</bold>) Immunofluorescence staining of the HEK293 cells treated with indicated conditions using the Alexa Fluor 647 labeled recombinant streptavidin (Strep-647).

In the absence of differentiation inhibitor LIF, mESCs cultured in suspension spontaneously form three-dimensional aggregates called embryoid bodies (EBs), which could recapitulate many aspects of early embryogenesis, including the induction of three early germ lineages (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib88">Simunovic and Brivanlou, 2017</xref>). To understand the role of Dhx9 in regulating the pluripotency of mESCs, we performed the EB assay using the wild-type and <italic>dhx9<sup>KO</sup></italic> mESCs. As the EB differentiation progressed, loss of Dhx9 resulted in apparently smaller and fewer EBs than wild-type cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8">Figure 8F</xref>).

As shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig9">Figure 9B</xref>, the patterns of BG4 CUT&amp;Tag peaks overlap well with those of PQS while HepG4-seq peaks exhibit a much sharper shape and better resolution around the center of PQS patterns, indicating that BG4 may promote the folding of G4 motifs. Interestingly, the signal intensities of the HepG4-seq peaks are significantly lower than those of BG4 CUT&amp;Tag in HEK293 cells, but obviously higher than those of BG4 CUT&amp;Tag in mESCs. In the in vitro hemin-G4-induced self-biotinylation assay, parallel G4s exhibit higher peroxidase activities than anti-parallel G4s (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib55">Lat et al., 2020</xref>).

First, we compared the HBD-seq with S9.6 CUT&amp;Tag in mESCs using the same bioinformatic pipeline and SEACR for peak calling. As a result, HBD-seq and S9.6 CUT&amp;Tag identified similar numbers of peaks (125,311 for HBD-seq, 154,993 for S9.6 CUT&amp;Tag), and 45,989 HBD-seq peaks overlap with 88,036 S9.6 peaks, indicating that S9.6 peaks are possibly narrower than HBD-seq peaks. As shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig9">Figure 9D</xref>, the overlapping peaks showed similar heatmap patterns and signal intensities between HBD-seq and S9.6 CUT&amp;Tag while, notably, peaks of S9.6 CUT&amp;Tag exhibit a much sharper signals at the center of peaks, which reflect the difference of binding modules of HBD and S9.6. GST-2xHBD and S9.6 mediated CUT&amp;Tag were shown to generate highly similar native R-loop profiles (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib96">Wang et al., 2021</xref>). HBD-seq, as an optimized version of GST-2xHBD CUT&amp;Tag, still generated ~80,000 extra peaks compared to S9.6 CUT&amp;Tag, suggesting that the status of the recombinant 2xHBD protein could substantially affect R-loop mapping. To understand the difference among inactive ribonuclease H1-based methods, we compared the HBD-seq, MapR (inactive ribonuclease H1-mediated CUT&amp;Run) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib103">Yan et al., 2019</xref>) and GST-2xHBD CUT&amp;Tag (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib96">Wang et al., 2021</xref>) and re-analyzed the data using the same pipeline and peak caller SEACR. In HEK293 cells, HBD-seq, MapR, and GST-2xHBD CUT&amp;Tag identified 42,488, 12,520, and 17,570 peaks, respectively; 5752 MaR peaks and 11,701 GST-2xHBD CUT&amp;Tag peaks overlap with HBD-seq peaks (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig9">Figure 9E</xref>). Notably, the heatmap of all HBD-seq peaks showed an obviously stronger signal intensities and sharper peak shapes than MapR and GST-2xHBD CUT&amp;Tag, suggesting that HBD-seq provides superior R-loop signals. In consideration of the difference in DNA-RNA hybrid binding affinity and/or specificity between HBD and S9.6, the HBD-seq and S9.6 CUT&amp;Tag may need to be combined together to carefully explain the native R-loops.</p></sec></sec><sec id="s3" sec-type="discussion"><title>Discussion</title><p>In this study, we developed the new method ‘HepG4-seq’ and optimized the RNase H1 HBD domain-based HBD-seq to robustly map endogenous G4s and R-loops, respectively, in living cells with high specificity. Using the HepG4-seq and HBD-seq, we systematically characterized the native co-localized G4s and R-loops in HEK293 cells and mESCs, and revealed that co-localized G4s and R-loops are dynamically altered in a cell type-dependent way and largely localized at active promoters and enhancers of transcriptional active genes. Small molecules-induced inhibition of helicases BLM or WRN resulted in a significant accumulation of G4s within co-localized G4s and R-loops and at the same time led to genes with significantly differential expression in HEK293 cells that are enriched in the processes related to cell cycle, DNA metabolic, DNA damage response, chromatin binding, et al. Furthermore, we characterized the helicase Dhx9 as a key regulator of co-localized G4s and R-loops which efficiently unwinds or promotes co-localized G4s and R-loops, and illustrated that depletion of Dhx9 significantly altered the transcription of co-localized G4s and R-loops-associated genes that are enriched in embryonic development, cell differentiation, and germ lineage development, et al. Therefore, the loss of Dhx9 apparently impaired the self-renewal and pluripotency of mESCs.</p><p>In this study, we utilized a low dosage of hemin, similar to the physiological concentration in normal human erythrocytes, to spark the peroxidase activity of endogenous G4s without significantly altering the levels of native G4s (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1B, C</xref>) and further robustly biotinylated G4s themselves by G4-hermin complex-mediated proximity labeling in just 1 min in living cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Cheng et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Einarson and Sen, 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib55">Lat et al., 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib58">Li et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib89">Stadlbauer et al., 2021</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib104">Yang et al., 2011</xref>). In consideration of the high affinity and specificity, the recombinant streptavidin monomer (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib61">Lim et al., 2013</xref>) is able to recognize the biotinylated G4s with high sensitivity and specificity and thereby yield robust CUT&amp;Tag signals with the help of Moon-tag system (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Boersma et al., 2019</xref>). Therefore, our HepG4-seq strategy is able to robustly and specifically capture native G4s. In HEK293 cells, HepG4-seq uncovered 6799 consensus G4 peaks under wild-type status and 77,003 G4 peaks in the presence of BLM/WRN inhibitors, suggesting that HepG4-seq is capable of detecting endogenous G4s with high sensitivity. Yet, the hemin-G4 complex-induced peroxidase activities were reported to be variable between parallelled and anti-parallelled G4s in the in vitro assay (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib55">Lat et al., 2020</xref>), although only 2–4 synthesized short DNA fragments were used for the test. Given that a method of genome-widely distinguishing parallelled and anti-parallelled G4s is lacking, HepG4-seq and BG4-seq may be combined to characterize the conformation of G4s.</p><p>Notably, we also discovered that the native co-localized G4s and R-loops landscape is altered in a cell-dependent manner and that approximately 10 folds more peaks were observed in mESCs than in HEK293 cells, which reflects that co-localized G4s and R-loops have the potential to regulate the complex pluripotency network in mESCs. CTCF is a key regulator of genome organization and gene expression (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib77">Ong and Corces, 2014</xref>). Recently, Wulfridge et al. reported that CTCF-bound regions are enriched for both R-loops, and G4s and G4s associated with R-loops promote CTCF binding (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib98">Wulfridge et al., 2023</xref>). Interestingly, the enriched motif with the most significant p-value in mESCs co-localized G4s and R-loops (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4G</xref>) well matches the motif of CTCF ChIP-seq, suggesting that co-localized G4s and R-loops may be able to modulate the CTCF binding. To be noticed, the co-localized G4s and R-loops were identified by bioinformatically intersection analysis. The heterogenous distribution between cells will give false positive co-occurrence patterns. Recently, multi-CUT&amp;Tag, a method for simultaneous mapping of multiple chromatin proteins, has been reported (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Bartosovic and Castelo-Branco, 2023</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">Gopalan et al., 2021</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib69">Meers et al., 2023</xref>). As the multi-CUT&amp;Tag, we could combine the HepG4 and HBD-seq to simultaneously map the co-localized G4s and R-loops even in the single cell level.</p><p>Furthermore, while 47,857 co-localized G4s and R-loops are directly bound by Dhx9 in the wild-type mESCs (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="supp2">Supplementary file 2</xref>), only 4060 of them display significantly differential signals in the absence of Dhx9. In addition, a limited number of co-localized G4s and R-loops showed differential G4s and R-loops at the same time in the <italic>dhx9<sup>KO</sup></italic> mESCs. These data suggest that redundant regulators exist. It is worth noting that depletion of Dhx9 significantly altered the transcription of 30 known G4s and/or R-loops helicases/regulators (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7A</xref>) and that half of these helicases/regulators are able to establish physical interaction network (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6s1">Figure 6—figure supplement 1E</xref>). Due to the redundancy and compensatory roles of G4 and R-loop regulators, a comprehensively mechanistic study of G4 and R-loop interplay in living cells is difficult and lacking in the field. A degron system-mediated simultaneous and/or stepwise degradation system of multiple regulators will help us elucidate the interplaying effects between G4s and R-loops.</p><p>Taken together, our study provides new insights into exploring the regulatory roles of co-localized G4s and R-loops in development and disease.</p></sec><sec id="s4" sec-type="materials|methods"><title>Materials and methods</title><table-wrap id="keyresource" position="anchor"><label>Key resources table</label><table frame="hsides" rules="groups"><thead><tr><th align="left" valign="bottom">Reagent type (species) or resource</th><th align="left" valign="bottom">Designation</th><th align="left" valign="bottom">Source or reference</th><th align="left" valign="bottom">Identifiers</th><th align="left" valign="bottom">Additional information</th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td align="left" valign="bottom">Antibody</td><td align="left" valign="bottom">anti-Dhx9 (Rabbit monoclonal)</td><td align="left" valign="bottom">ABclonal</td><td align="left" valign="bottom">Cat# A4563;

To detect the differential peaks, peaks from different groups were first re-centered and trimmed based on calculating their reads coverage within a fix bin (400 bp) using R package DiffBind (v3.12); the read coverage of each peak was normalized using the scale factor calculated above; the significantly differential peaks were defined as peaks with the significance cut-off p-value &lt;0.05 and fold change (FC) ≥1.5; BEDTools were then used to identify overlaps between the significantly differential peaks and original peaks from SEACR to retrieve original peak sites with differential levels in different groups that were used subsequently as input file of HOMER software (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib42">Heinz et al., 2010</xref>).

Meanwhile, the &quot;GST-His6-2xHBD&quot;-mediated CUT&amp;Tag protocol (Wang et al., 2021) was optimized by replacing fusion protein and tag, the optimized HBD-seq avoids the generation of GST fusion protein aggregates and can reflect the genome-wide distribution of R-loops in vivo.</p><p>The authors employed HepG4-seq and HBD-seq to establish comprehensive maps of native co-localized G4s and R-loops in human HEK293 cells and mouse embryonic stem cells (mESCs).

The authors referred (Hartono et al., 2018; Konig et al., 2017; Phillips et al., 2013) need to be updated, and the author's bias against S9.6 antibodies needs also to be changed. In contrast to S9.6 CUT&amp;Tag and other inactive ribonucleotide H1-based methods including MapR (inactive ribonucleotide H1-mediated CUT&amp;Run) (Yan et al., 2019)and GST-2xHBD CUT&amp;Tag (Wang et al., 2021), HBD-seq did not perform satisfactorily and its binding specificity was questionable.</p><p>Although HepG4-seq is an effective G4s detection technique, and the authors have also verified its reliability to some extent, given the strong link between ROS homeostasis and G4s formation, hemin's affinity for different types of G4s and their differences in peroxidase activities, whether HepG4-seq reflects the dynamics of G4s in vivo more accurately than existing detection techniques still needs to be more carefully corroborated.</p><p>The authors focus on the interaction of non-B DNA structures G4s and R-loops and their roles in development and disease by regulating the transcription of related genes. Compared to the complex regulatory network of G4s and R-loops, the authors provide limited mechanistic insight into the major regulator of co-localized G4s and R-loops, helicase Dhx9. However, the authors propose that &quot;A degron system-mediated simultaneous and/or stepwise degradation system of multiple regulators will help us elucidate the interplaying effects between G4s and R-loops.&quot; is attractive. The main innovations of this article are the proposal of new antibody-independent methods for detecting G4s and the optimization of the GST-2xHBD CUT&amp;Tag (Wang et al., 2021) method for detecting R-loops. Unfortunately, however, the reliability and accuracy of these methods are still debatable, and the reference value of the G4s and R-loops datasets based on these methods is relatively limited.</p></body></sub-article><sub-article article-type="author-comment" id="sa4"><front-stub><article-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.99026.3.sa4</article-id><title-group><article-title>Author response</article-title></title-group><contrib-group><contrib contrib-type="author"><name><surname>Liu</surname><given-names>Ting</given-names></name><role specific-use="author">Author</role><aff><institution>Sichuan University</institution><addr-line><named-content content-type="city">Chengdu</named-content></addr-line><country>China</country></aff></contrib><contrib contrib-type="author"><name><surname>Shen</surname><given-names>Xing</given-names></name><role specific-use="author">Author</role><aff><institution>Sichuan University</institution><addr-line><named-content content-type="city">Chengdu</named-content></addr-line><country>China</country></aff></contrib><contrib contrib-type="author"><name><surname>Ren</surname><given-names>Yijia</given-names></name><role specific-use="author">Author</role><aff><institution>West China Second University Hospital of Sichuan University</institution><addr-line><named-content content-type="city">Chengdu</named-content></addr-line><country>China</country></aff></contrib><contrib contrib-type="author"><name><surname>Lu</surname><given-names>Hongyu</given-names></name><role specific-use="author">Author</role><aff><institution>Sichuan University</institution><addr-line><named-content content-type="city">Chengdu</named-content></addr-line><country>China</country></aff></contrib><contrib contrib-type="author"><name><surname>Liu</surname><given-names>Yu</given-names></name><role specific-use="author">Author</role><aff><institution>Sichuan University</institution><addr-line><named-content content-type="city">Chengdu</named-content></addr-line><country>China</country></aff></contrib><contrib contrib-type="author"><name><surname>Chen</surname><given-names>Chong</given-names></name><role specific-use="author">Author</role><aff><institution>Sichuan University</institution><addr-line><named-content content-type="city">Chengdu</named-content></addr-line><country>China</country></aff></contrib><contrib contrib-type="author"><name><surname>Yu</surname><given-names>Lin</given-names></name><role specific-use="author">Author</role><aff><institution>West China Second University Hospital of Sichuan University</institution><addr-line><named-content content-type="city">Chengdu</named-content></addr-line><country>China</country></aff></contrib><contrib contrib-type="author"><name><surname>Xue</surname><given-names>Zhihong</given-names></name><role specific-use="author">Author</role><aff><institution>West China Second University Hospital of Sichuan University</institution><addr-line><named-content content-type="city">Chengdu</named-content></addr-line><country>China</country></aff></contrib></contrib-group></front-stub><body><p>The following is the authors’ response to the original reviews.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p><bold>eLife assessment</bold></p><p>This useful study describes an antibody-free method to map G-quadruplexes (G4s) in vertebrate cells.

In the end, it does not substantially improve our understanding of DHX9's mode of action.</p></disp-quote><p>In this study, we aimed to report new methods for capturing endogenous G4s and R-loops in living cells. Dhx9 has been reported to directly unwind R-loops and G4s or promote R-loop formation (PMID: 21561811, 30341290, 29742442, 32541651, 35905379, 34316718). To understand the direct Dhx9-bound G4s and R-loops, we performed the Dhx9 CUT&amp;Tag assay and analyzed the co-localization of Dhx9-binding sites and G4s or R-loops. We found that 47,857 co-localized G4s and R-loops are directly bound by Dhx9 in the wild-type mESCs and 4,060 of them display significantly differential signals in absence of Dhx9, suggesting that redundant regulators exist as well. We showed that depletion of Dhx9 significantly altered the RNA levels of several key regulators of mESC and embryonic development, such as Nanog, Lin28a, Bmp4, Wnt8a, Gata2, and Lef1, which coincides with the significantly differential levels of G4s or R-loops around the TSS or gene bodies of these genes (Fig.7). The comprehensive molecular mechanism of Dhx9 action is indeed not the focus of this study. We will work on it in the future studies. Thank you for the comments.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>There is no in-depth comparison of the newly generated data with existing datasets and no rigorous control was presented to test the specificity of the hemin-G4 interaction (a lot of the hemin-dependent signal seems to occur in the cytoplasm, which is unexpected).</p></disp-quote><p>The specificity of hemin-G4-induced peroxidase activity and self-biotinylation has been well demonstrated in previous studies (PMID: 19618960, 22106035, 28973477, 32329781). In the Fig.1A, we compared the hemin-G4-induced biotinylation levels in different conditions. Cells treated with hemin and Bio-An exhibited a robust fluorescence signal, while the absence of either hemin or Bio-An almost completely abolished the biotinylation signals, suggesting a specific and active biotinylation activity. To identify the specific signals, we have included the non-label control and used this control to call confident HepG4 peaks in all HepG4-seq assays.</p><p>The hemin-RNA G4 complex has also been reported to have mimic peroxidase activity and trigger similar self-biotinylation signals as DNA G4s (PMID: 32329781, 31257395, 27422869). Therefore, it is not surprising to observe hemin-dependent signals in the cytoplasm generated by cytoplasmic RNA G4s.</p><p>In the revised version, we have included a new Fig. 9 and a new section “Comparisons of HepG4-seq and HBD-seq with previous methods” to carefully compare our methods to other methods.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>The authors talk about co-occurrence between G4 and R-loops but their data does not actually demonstrate co-occurrence in time. If the same loci could form alternatively either R-loops or G4 and if DHX9 was somehow involved in determining the balance between G4s and R-loops, the authors would probably obtain the same distribution pattern. To manipulate R-loop levels in vivo and test how this affects HEPG4-seq signals would have been helpful.</p></disp-quote><p>Single-molecule fluorescence studies have shown the existence of a positive feedback mechanism of G4 and R-loop formation during transcription (PMID: 32810236, 32636376), suggesting that G4s and Rloops could co-localize at the same molecule. Dhx9 is a versatile helicase capable of directly resolving R-loops and G4s or promoting R-loop formation (PMID: 21561811, 30341290, 29742442, 32541651, 35905379, 34316718). Although depletion of Dhx9 resulted in 6,171 Dhx9-bound co-localized G4s and R-loops with significantly altered levels of G4s or R-loops, only 276 of them (~4.5%) harbored altered G4s and R-loops, suggesting that the interacting G4s and R-loops are rare in living cells. Nowadays, the genome-wide co-occurrence of two factors are mainly obtained by bioinformatically intersection analysis. We agreed that F We will carefully discuss this point in the revised version.

This is a problem as global changes in DNA accessibility might strongly skew the results. It is unclear at this stage whether the lack of DHX9, BLM, or WRN has an impact on DNA accessibility, which might underlie the differences that were observed. Moreover, Tn5 cleaves DNA at a nearby accessible site, which might be at an unknown distance away from the site of interest. The spatial accuracy of Tn5-based methods is therefore debatable, which is a problem when trying to demonstrate spatial co-occurrence. Alternative mapping methods would have been helpful.</p></disp-quote><p>In this study, we used the recombinant streptavidin monomer and anti-GP41 nanobody fusion protein (mSA-scFv) to specifically recognize hemin-G4-induced biotinylated G4 and then recruit the recombinant GP41-tagged Tn5 protein to these G4s sites. Similarly, the recombinant V5-tagged N-terminal hybrid-binding domain (HBD) of RNase H1 specifically recognizes R-loops and recruit the recombinant protein G-Tn5 (pG-Tn5) with the help of anti-V5 antibody. Therefore, the spatial distance of Tn5 to the target sites is well controlled and very short, and also the recruitment of Tn5 is specifically determined by the existence of G4s in HepG4-seq and R-loops in HBD-seq. In addition, RNase treatment markedly abolished the HBD-seq signals and the non-labeled controls exhibit obviously reduction of HepG4-seq signals, demonstrating that HBD-seq and HepG4-seq were not contamination from tagmentation of asccessible DNA.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p><bold>Reviewer #2 (Public Review):</bold></p><p>Summary:</p><p>In this study, Liu et al. explore the interplay between G-quadruplexes (G4s) and R-loops.

It is unclear why this happens but it might happen if somehow hemin increased the probability that the Tn5 is close to chromatin in an unspecific manner (it would cut G-rich, nucleosome-poor, accessible sites in an unspecific manner). To discard this possibility, it would be interesting to investigate directly which loci are biotinylated. For this, the authors could extract and sonicate the genomic DNA and use streptavidin to enrich for biotinylated fragments. Strand-specific DNA sequencing could then be used to map the biotinylated loci.</p></disp-quote><p>In the cell culture medium, there were a certain amount of hemin from serum and a low dosage of biotin from the basal medium DMEM, which could not be avoid. Thus, these contaminated hemin and biotin would generate the background signals observed in the Non-label control samples. The biotinylated sites were specifically recognized by the recombinant Streptavidin monomer which further recruits Tn5 to the biotinylated sites with the help of Moon-tag. Different from the signals in the HEK293 samples, a much more robust HepG4-seq signals were observed in the mESC samples and the signals were also abolished in the non-label control samples. Thus, the relatively small signal-to-noise ratio in the HEK293 samples suggest the week abundance of endogenous G4s in the HEK293 cells. Thus, we politely disagree that hemin increased the non-specific recruitment of Th5. In addition, the CUT&amp;Tag technology has been wildly demonstrated to have a much lower background, high signal-to-noise ratio and high sensitivity.

These data have clearly shown the roles of Dhx9 directly modulating the stabilities of G4s and R-loops. Furthermore, we showed that loss of Dhx9 caused 816 Dhx9 directly bound colocalized G4 and R-loop associated genes significantly differentially expressed, supporting the transcriptional regulation of Dhx9.

The authors referred to (Hartono et al., 2018; Konig et al., 2017; Phillips et al., 2013) need to be updated, and the author's bias against S9.6 antibodies needs also to be changed. However, as the authors had questioned the specificity of the S9.6 antibody, they should compare in parallel with the data they have and the data generated by the widely used S9.6 antibody.</p></disp-quote><p>Thank you for the updating information about the structure data of S9.6 antibody. We politely disagree the specificity of the S9.6 antibody on RNA:DNA hybrids. The structural studies of S9.6 (PMID: 35347133, 35550870) used only one RNA:DNA hybrid to show the superior specificity of S9.6 on RNA:DNA hybrid than dsRNA and dsDNA. However, Fabian K. et al has reported that the binding affinities of S9.6 on RNA:DNA hybrid exhibits obvious sequence-dependent bias from null to nanomolar range (PMID: 28594954). We have included the comparison between S9.6-derived data and our HBD-seq data in the Fig.9 and the section “Comparisons of HepG4-seq and HBD-seq with previous methods”.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>(5) It is hoped that the results of immunofluorescence experiments can be statistically analyzed.</p></disp-quote><p>We have performed the statistical analysis and included the data in the new figure.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>(6) Some minor errors:</p><p>Line 168, &quot;G4-froming&quot; should be &quot;G4-forming&quot;;</p><p>Figure 5E, the color of the &quot;Repressed&quot; average signal at the top of the HepG4-seq heatmap should be blue;</p><p>Figure 7C, the abbreviation &quot;Gloop&quot; should be indicated in the text or in the figure caption.</p></disp-quote><p>Thank you for pointing out these issues.
