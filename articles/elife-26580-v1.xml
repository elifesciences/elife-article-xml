However, extracting novel genomes from complex mixtures of metagenomic data can still be challenging and represents an ill-posed problem which is generally approached with ad hoc methods. Here we present a microfluidic-based mini-metagenomic method which offers a statistically rigorous approach to extract novel microbial genomes while preserving single-cell resolution. We used this approach to analyze two hot spring samples from Yellowstone National Park and extracted 29 new genomes, including three deeply branching lineages. The single-cell resolution enabled accurate quantification of genome function and abundance, down to 1% in relative abundance. Our analyses of genome level SNP distributions also revealed low to moderate environmental selection. The scale, resolution, and statistical power of microfluidic-based mini-metagenomics make it a powerful tool to dissect the genomic structure of microbial communities while effectively preserving the fundamental unit of biology, the single cell.</p><p><bold>DOI:</bold> <ext-link ext-link-type="doi" xlink:href="10.7554/eLife.26580.001">http://dx.doi.org/10.7554/eLife.26580.001</ext-link></p></abstract><kwd-group kwd-group-type="author-keywords"><title>Author Keywords</title><kwd>metagenomics</kwd><kwd>novel phylogenetic groups</kwd><kwd>bining</kwd><kwd>microfluidics</kwd><kwd>Yellowstone National Park</kwd><kwd>mini-metagenomics</kwd></kwd-group><kwd-group kwd-group-type="research-organism"><title>Research Organism</title><kwd>Other</kwd></kwd-group><funding-group><award-group id="par-1"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution>Department of Energy Joint Genome Institute</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>Emerging Technology Opportunity Program</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Yu</surname><given-names>Feiqiao Brian</given-names></name><name><surname>Quake</surname><given-names>Stephen R</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="par-2"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000925</institution-id><institution>John Templeton Foundation</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>51250</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Yu</surname><given-names>Feiqiao Brian</given-names></name><name><surname>Quake</surname><given-names>Stephen R</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="par-3"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100005492</institution-id><institution>Stanford University</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>Stanford Graduate Fellowship</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Yu</surname><given-names>Feiqiao Brian</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="par-4"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000001</institution-id><institution>National Science Foundation</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>Graduate Research Fellowship Program</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Yu</surname><given-names>Feiqiao Brian</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="par-5"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000861</institution-id><institution>Burroughs Wellcome Fund</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>Career Award at the Scientific Interface</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Blainey</surname><given-names>Paul C</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><funding-statement>The funders had no role in study design, data collection and interpretation, or the decision to submit the work for publication.</funding-statement></funding-group><custom-meta-group><custom-meta><meta-name>elife-xml-version</meta-name><meta-value>2.5</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta specific-use="meta-only"><meta-name>Author impact statement</meta-name><meta-value>Microfluidic-based mini-metagenomics enables the investigation of environmental microbial communities in high-throughput and with single-cell resolution, facilitating genome binning and quantification of function, abundance, and genome variation.</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>eLife Digest</meta-name><meta-value>2.5</meta-value></custom-meta></custom-meta-group></article-meta></front><body><sec id="s1" sec-type="intro"><title>Introduction</title><p>Advances in sequencing technologies have enabled the development of shotgun metagenomics and single-cell approaches to investigate environmental microbial communities. These studies revealed many previously uncharacterized genomes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Brown et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Eloe-Fadrosh et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Kashtan et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">Rinke et al., 2013</xref>), increasing the total number of sequenced microbial genomes to more than 50,000 (Joint Genome Institute’s Integrated Microbial Genomes database, accessed December 1, 2016). However, the majority of environmental microbial diversity remains uncharacterized due to limitations in current techniques. Conventional shotgun metagenomic sequencing offers the ability to assemble genomes from a single heterogeneous sample, but is effective only if the complexity of the sample is not too great (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Howe et al., 2014</xref>). Furthermore, it is often difficult to separate contigs belonging to closely related organisms because techniques designed to resolve these differences, such as tetranucleotide analysis, depend on ad hoc assumptions about nucleotide usage (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Dick et al., 2009</xref>). It is possible to perform rigorous assemblies from independent single-cell genome amplifications but at the expense of lowering throughput (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">Rinke et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Blainey, 2013</xref>). In addition, when performed in plates, single-cell sequencing approaches are typically expensive and laborious, although microfluidic approaches have helped to alleviate that limitation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Blainey et al., 2011</xref>).</p><p>We report here a new mini-metagenomics approach which combines the advantages of shotgun and single-cell metagenomic analyses. This approach uses microfluidic parallelization to separate an environmental sample into many small sub-samples containing 5–10 cells, significantly reducing complexity of each sub-sample and allowing high quality assembly while enabling higher throughput than typical single-cell methods. Although each sub-sample contains a limited mixture of several genomes, single-cell resolution is regained through correlations of genome co-occurrence across sub-samples, which in turn enables a rigorous statistical interpretation of confidence and genome association.</p><p>We validated this approach using a synthetic mixture of defined microbial species and then applied it to analyze two hot spring samples from Yellowstone National Park. Among 29 genomes larger than 0.5 Mbps, most belong to known bacterial and archaeal phyla but represent novel lineages at lower taxonomic levels; three genomes represent deeply branching novel phylogenies. Functional analysis revealed different metabolic pathways that cells may use to achieve the same biochemical process such as nitrogen and sulfur reduction. Using information associated with genome occurrence across sub-samples, we further assessed abundance and genome variations at the single-cell level. Our analyses demonstrate the power of the mini-metagenomic approach in de-convolving genomes from complex samples and assessing diversity in a mixed microbial population.</p></sec><sec id="s2" sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><sec id="s2-1"><title>Evaluating microfluidic-based mini-metagenomics using a mock community reveals improved whole genome amplification</title><p>Microfluidic-based mini-metagenomics begins with microfluidic partitioning of each environmental sample randomly into 96 sub-samples with 5–10 cells per sub-sample (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1A</xref>). 96 lysis and MDA (Multiple Displacement Amplification) reactions are performed in independent chambers of an automated and commercially available Fluidigm C1 Integrated Fluidic Circuit (IFC) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1B</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1</xref>), which significantly reduces the time and effort required to perform these reactions. The C1 IFC has been used previously for mammalian single-cell RNA-seq and genome analysis experiments (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib43">Wu et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">Pollen et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib41">Treutlein et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Gawad et al., 2014</xref>). The hardware, including the microfluidic circuit, was not altered for the mini-metagenomic experiments, but we did adapt a new reagent kit and designed scripts and protocols for amplifying genomic DNA from microbial cells. After whole-genome amplification, DNA from each sub-sample is harvested into a 96 well plate, and all subsequent wet lab steps are performed on the bench top. Sequencing libraries are prepared with distinct barcodes labeling DNA derived from each sub-sample and sequenced on the Illumina Nextseq platform (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1C</xref>). Because of the small volumes used for microfluidic reactions, precious microbial samples and/or low cell concentrations that may not yield enough DNA for shotgun metagenomics can still be analyzed using this process. Another advantage of using a microfluidic platform is the enclosed reaction environment that limits potential contamination often observed with low input MDA reactions in well plates, a problem that, with other approaches, requires sophisticated protocols for contamination prevention and removal (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib42">Woyke et al., 2011</xref>). In addition, smaller MDA reaction volumes (~300 nL) are associated with lower gain and less amplification bias, which effectively improves coverage uniformity of amplified genomes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">de Bourcy et al., 2014</xref>) (Materials and methods).<fig-group><fig id="fig1" position="float"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.26580.002</object-id><label>Figure 1.</label><caption><title>Microfluidic-based mini-metagenomics pipeline.</title><p>(<bold>A</bold>) An environmental microbial sample is loaded onto a Fluidigm C1 IFC at the appropriate concentration so that cells are randomly dispersed into 96 microfluidic chambers at 5–10 cells per chamber.

Reads from each sub-sample are trimmed and assembled into sub-sample contigs (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1D</xref>), creating genome subassemblies. Since cells representing the same genome may appear in multiple sub-samples, overlapping genome subassemblies can be identified. Therefore, combined assembly of sub-sample reads and contigs results in longer mini-metagenomic contigs from which more meaningful biological information can be inferred (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1E</xref>). With this mini-metagenomic approach, cells from the same phylogenetic groups are randomly partitioned into different sub-samples, providing a physically defined approach to bin metagenomic contigs. Aligning reads from each sub-sample to mini-metagenomic contigs enables us to determine the co-occurrence pattern of each contig (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1F,G</xref>). Based on presence patterns across sub-samples, a <italic>p</italic> value for each pair of contigs is computed based on Fisher’s exact test (Materials and methods), where a small <italic>p</italic> is interpreted as an indicator that two contigs belong to cells of the same genome. Finally, co-occurrence based <italic>p</italic> values are used as a pairwise distance metric for sequence-independent contig clustering (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1H</xref>; Materials and methods).</p><p>We tested performance of the mini-metagenomic amplification on the Fluidigm C1 IFC using a mixture of five bacterial species with known genomes (<italic>E. vietnamensis</italic>, <italic>S. oneidensis</italic>, <italic>E. coli</italic>, <italic>M. ruber</italic>, and <italic>P. putida</italic>) (<xref ref-type="table" rid="tbl1">Table 1</xref>; Materials and methods). We first used a dilution of the control sample at ~10 cells per sub-sample. Then, we further diluted the control sample so that each sub-sample contained 0.5 cells on average, effectively performing microfluidic single-cell MDA with the same downstream steps (Materials and methods). Performing MDA from multiple cells in a 300 nL microfluidic chamber improved genome coverage at similar sequencing depths because smaller MDA reaction volumes tend to reduce amplification gain and bias (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">de Bourcy et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib45">Zong et al., 2012</xref>).<table-wrap id="tbl1" position="float"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.26580.006</object-id><label>Table 1.</label><caption><p>Species used to construct mock bacterial communities.</p><p><bold>DOI:</bold> <ext-link ext-link-type="doi" xlink:href="10.7554/eLife.26580.006">http://dx.doi.org/10.7554/eLife.26580.006</ext-link></p></caption><table frame="hsides" rules="groups"><thead><tr><th>Species name</th><th>GC content (%)</th><th>Culture source</th><th>Growth medium</th><th>Assession numbers</th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td><italic>Echinicola vietnamensis</italic> KMM6221</td><td>44.7</td><td>DSM 17526</td><td>Marine broth</td><td>NC_019904.1</td></tr><tr><td><italic>Shewanella oneidensis</italic> MR1</td><td>45.9</td><td>JGI</td><td>LB</td><td>NC_004347.2</td></tr><tr><td><italic>Escherichia coli</italic> MG1655</td><td>50.8</td><td>ATCC 700926</td><td>LB</td><td>NC_000913.3</td></tr><tr><td><italic>Pseudomonas putida</italic> F1</td><td>61.9</td><td>ATCC 700007</td><td>Nutrient medium</td><td>NC_009512.1</td></tr><tr><td><italic>Meiothermus ruber</italic></td><td>63.4</td><td>DSM 1279</td><td>Termus ruber medium</td><td>NC_013946.1</td></tr></tbody></table></table-wrap></p><p>Thirty mini-metagenomic and 36 single-cell limiting dilution sub-samples yielded 169 and 194 million paired end reads, respectively.

Mini-metagenomic MDA reactions produced higher median coverage than single-cell MDA reactions at all sequencing depths (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s3">Figure 1—figure supplement 3A</xref>). The proportion of assembled genome as a function of aligned genome, however, did not differ significantly between mini-metagenomic and single-cell methods (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s3">Figure 1—figure supplement 3B</xref>). Therefore, data from mock bacterial communities demonstrate that with the mini-metagenomic method, less sequencing cost is required to recover similar genome coverage as compared to single-cell experiments, with the improvement mostly associated with the amplification rather than assembly steps.</p></sec><sec id="s2-2"><title>Microfluidic-based mini-metagenomics enables contig binning based on co-occurrence patterns</title><p>Next, we performed microfluidic mini-metagenomic sequencing on two hot spring samples from Yellowstone National Park (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2</xref>; Materials and methods). Sample #1 was collected from Bijah Spring and sample #2 was collected from Mound Spring (<xref ref-type="table" rid="tbl2">Table 2</xref>). 121 and 133 million paired end reads were obtained from the two samples respectively. We removed sub-samples with less than 800,000 paired end reads, yielding 49 and 93 sub-samples respectively. After quality filtering, &gt;90% reads from each sub-sample were incorporated into contigs during independent assemblies (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s1">Figure 2—figure supplement 1</xref>). Re-assembling combined sub-sample reads increased contig length (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s2">Figure 2—figure supplement 2A</xref>). We obtained 643 and 1474 contigs longer than 10 kbp from the two samples, respectively, and used these contigs for subsequent analyses (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s2">Figure 2—figure supplement 2B</xref>; <xref ref-type="table" rid="tbl3">Table 3</xref>). To compare this performance to shotgun metagenomic assemblies, we obtained 32.5 million and 51.4 million shotgun metagenomic reads from Bijah Spring and Mound Spring samples and down sampled combined mini-metagenomic reads to match shotgun sequencing depths. After assembly (Materials and methods), we observed that for the Bijah Spring sample, where 49 sub-samples were available, the shotgun metagenomic assembly produced more contigs over 10 kbp (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s3">Figure 2—figure supplement 3A</xref>). However, for the Mound Spring sample, where 93 sub-samples were used, the mini-metagenomic assembly produced more contigs over 10 kbp. The largest contig from the mini-metagenomic assembly was also longer for the Mound Spring sample (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s3">Figure 2—figure supplement 3B</xref>). Therefore, it is likely that increasing the number of mini-metagenomic sub-samples improves assembly performance compared to shotgun metagenomics. It is also possible that the observed assembly improvement is due to higher complexity of the Mound Spring bacterial community, validating our hypothesis that the mini-metagenomic method benefits the analysis of complex microbial populations.<fig-group><fig id="fig2" position="float"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.26580.007</object-id><label>Figure 2.</label><caption><title>Genome bins extracted from microfluidic-based mini-metagenomic sequencing of Yellowstone National Park samples.</title><p>Two samples from Bijah Spring in Mammoth Norris Corridor (<bold>A, C</bold>) and Mound Spring in Lower Geyser Spring Basin (<bold>B, D</bold>) were collected from Yellowstone National Park and analyzed using the microfluidic-based mini-metagenomic pipeline.

In order to bin contigs into genomes, reads from each sub-sample were aligned back to mini-metagenomic contigs and coverage was tabulated (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2A,B</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s2">Figure 2—figure supplement 2C,D</xref>). Many contig sets share similar coverage patterns across sub-samples, suggesting that they originate from the same genome. Because MDA results in variable coverage profiles, we generated a binary occurrence map by applying a coverage threshold (Materials and methods). Pairwise <italic>p</italic> values were computed with Fisher’s exact test (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2A,B</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s4">Figure 2—figure supplement 4</xref>). Finally, dimensionality reduction using pairwise <italic>p</italic> values as a distance metric generated clusters of contigs belonging to the same genomes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Maaten and Hinton, 2008</xref>) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s5">Figure 2—figure supplement 5</xref>).</p><p>To verify the validity of presence-based contig clusters, we annotated all predicted open reading frames (ORFs) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Huntemann et al., 2016</xref>) (Materials and methods). The relationship between contig length and the number of genes found is linear (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s6">Figure 2—figure supplement 6</xref>), consistent with small non-coding regions in bacterial genomes. Annotations were found for ~50% of the genes, and lineage assignment was performed using JGI’s IMG/ER pipeline for metagenome annotation based on gene annotations from the same contig (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Huntemann et al., 2016</xref>). If protein sequences of most genes on a contig were distantly related to known sequences, the contig was designated as unknown (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2C,D</xref>) (Materials and methods). Approximately 70% of all contigs were assigned at the phylum level. Contigs with known assignment and from the same cluster always belonged to the same phylum, demonstrating that the presence-based method can correctly bin metagenomic contigs into genomes (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2C,D</xref>). Some unassigned contigs are scattered among genome bins with known phylum level assignments and likely represent novel genes. Genome bins containing predominantly unassigned contigs are indicated by dotted circles (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2C,D</xref>) and likely represent deeply branching lineages.</p><p>We selected 29 partial genome bins from both hot spring samples with genome sizes over 0.5 Mbp for downstream analyses (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3A</xref>). Assessment of genome bins demonstrated various levels of completeness and &lt;5% marker gene duplication (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3B,C</xref>). Genome completeness was not necessarily correlated with genome size because completeness was assessed through single-copy marker genes using CheckM (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Parks et al., 2015</xref>). Using lineage assignment based on gene annotations, we identified eight genome bins with known phylum level assignments from the Bijah Spring sample. Three genomes (Bijah #3, Bijah #5, and Bijah #14) had unknown assignments (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2C</xref>). In the Mound Spring sample, more reads and sub-samples resulted in 14 genomes with known phylum level assignments and three unassigned genomes (Mound #3, Mound #4, and Mound #7) were extracted (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2D</xref>). A singleton contig 3.3 Mbp in length (#40) was also included as a separate genome. In both environmental samples, the ability to separate distinct clusters of <italic>Bacteroidetes</italic> contigs represents an advantage of our sequence-independent binning approach, where the presence of bacterial species across microfluidic chambers is determined only by Poisson distribution. Hence, the likelihood that closely related bacterial cells were isolated into the same chambers was small.<fig id="fig3" position="float"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.26580.016</object-id><label>Figure 3.</label><caption><title>Assembled size and completeness of Yellowstone hot spring genomes.</title><p>Genomes of Bijah Spring and Mound Spring samples are sorted by assembled genome size (<bold>A</bold>).

Thresholding coverage depth into an occurrence profile can be seen as digitizing an otherwise noisy analog signal, potentially reducing the effect of amplification bias, copy number variation, and genome size across genomes. Because cells were well-mixed before loading into the Fluidigm C1 IFC and that the microfluidic structures inside each chamber were much larger than the size of a microbial cell, cells were distributed randomly into microfluidic chambers, with occurrence profiles satisfying a Poisson distribution. We quantified the number of detected cells of all genomes in both samples (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6A,C,D</xref>; Materials and methods). Assembled genomes from the Bijah sample covered one order of magnitude in abundance. Genomes #10 (<italic>Deferribacteres</italic>) and #8 (<italic>Chlorobi</italic>) were most abundant, with 49 and 29 cells represented. On the lower end, Bijah #5 (<italic>S2R-29</italic>) was only represented in four sub-samples, most likely representing only four cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6C</xref>). In the Mound Spring sample, more sub-samples were sequenced, allowing the quantification of a larger abundance range across two orders of magnitude (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6D</xref>). Mound #40 (<italic>Ignavibacteria</italic>) was the most abundant lineage, appearing in all but seven sub-samples. The abundance of this genome was likely the reason for the successful assembly of its entire genome (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6B</xref>). Mound #7 (<italic>Chlorobi</italic>) and deeply branching Mound #15 were also abundant, allowing the capture of 36 and 65 cells respectively. For rare organisms, we detected Mound #11 (<italic>Bacteroidetes</italic>) and Mound #14 (<italic>Bathyarchaeota</italic>), which were present at &lt;1%. Comparing with relative abundance computed from shotgun coverage, we observed general agreement in relative abundance profiles, although a couple of genomes in Bijah Springs displayed large differences (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6s1">Figure 6—figure supplement 1A</xref>). Relative abundances were higher for less abundant genomes when the mini-metagenomic method was use, demonstrating its sensitivity to extracting rare phylogenies (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6s1">Figure 6—figure supplement 1A</xref>). In total, examining genomes larger than 0.5 Mbp, we captured 192 and 509 cells from Bijah and Mound Springs, respectively, corresponding to four to six cells per sub-sample. Even though this number was smaller than our intended ten cells per chamber, the difference was likely due to lysis inefficiency or smaller genomes excluded from our analysis.<fig-group><fig id="fig6" position="float"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.26580.021</object-id><label>Figure 6.</label><caption><title>Abundance and population variation of Yellowstone hot spring genomes.</title><p>(<bold>A</bold>) Abundance is derived from the occurrence pattern of contig clusters, where Poisson distribution is used to infer the number of cells processed.

An examination of species level lineage assignment to contigs revealed that genomes had consistent species level assignments when such assignments were present (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6s1">Figure 6—figure supplement 1B</xref>). Therefore, even though genomes were generated from a collection of cells across sub-samples, these cells represented genetic lineages at the species levels. We quantified observed single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) in each assembled genome normalized to the total assembled genome size (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6B</xref>; Materials and methods). We found a wide distribution in SNP abundance among phylogenies. All <italic>Ignavibacteriae</italic> and three <italic>Bacteroidetes</italic> genomes have low SNP rates (&lt;1%). In the Bijah Spring sample, members of <italic>Spirochaetes</italic>, <italic>Microgenomates</italic>, and <italic>S2R-29</italic> contain the most SNPs at 0.3–0.4% of the assembled genome. In the Mound Spring sample, members of <italic>Thermodesulfobacteria</italic> have the most SNPs (0.6%). Several other groups belonging to <italic>Bacteroidetes</italic>, <italic>Fervidibacteria</italic>, <italic>Euryarchaeota</italic>, and deeply branching Mound #4 all have a 0.3–0.4% SNP rate. It is not the case that larger, more complete, or more abundant genomes contain more SNPs in a population (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6s2">Figure 6—figure supplement 2</xref>), indicating that the observed SNP rate is a biological property of the particular genome. The ratio of nonsynonymous to synonymous SNP rates (dN/dS) is typically a measure of the strength of environmental selection (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Holt et al., 2008</xref>), with one indicating no selection and zero indicating strong selection. Among diverse genomes that allow more accurate assessment of SNP ratios, we found dN/dS ranging from 0.4 to 0.9 in the hot spring genomes, illustrating that different phylogenies in the same hot spring environment are subjected to different weak to moderate negative selection pressures. Taken together, the microfluidic-base mini-metagenomic method creates the statistical power from multiple sub-samples to more effectively bin contigs for functional analysis, quantify abundance, and assess genomic variation.</p></sec></sec><sec id="s3" sec-type="discussion"><title>Discussion</title><p>Previous work has implemented similar concepts of sequencing multiple bacterial cells together in order to increase throughput. However, the authors treated each sub-sample as an independent entity throughout their bioinformatic analysis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">McLean et al., 2013</xref>). The novelty of our analysis derives from treating information from sub-samples as different but overlapping sections of a more complex metagenome. Such an approach echoes recent work that uses coverage from many shotgun metagenomic samples containing a similar set of microbial phylogenies but with different abundances in order to aid bioinformatic genome binning (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Alneberg et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">Nielsen et al., 2014</xref>). Our approach differs with these methods in several aspects. First, our approach generates sub-samples from one, possibly low volume, microbial sample, eliminating the need to collect multiple spatial or temporal metagenomic samples. In addition, because of low complexity, each sub-sample does not need to be sequenced as deeply as using shotgun metagenomic methods, significantly saving sequencing cost. Although each sub-sample queries only a small subset of the true diversity, summation of all sub-samples approximates the original environment. Because of MDA bias, we do not use coverage depth directly for contig binning. Instead, as noted previously, thresholding coverage depth into an occurrence profile digitizes a possibly noisy analog signal. Such digitization reduces sensitivity to amplification and other bias associated with analog coverage signals.</p><p>Microfluidic-based mini-metagenomics provides researchers with two independent experimental design parameters in order to optimize the protocol for microbial samples of different complexities: the average number of cells per microfluidic chamber and the number of chambers to sequence. The statistical power of the presence based binning technique benefits from both the presence and absence of genomes across sub-samples. Therefore, for less complex samples, reducing the number of cells per microfluidic chamber ensures that cells of the same lineage do not appear in all sub-samples. For more complex samples, the number of cells per chamber can be increased to capture higher diversity. One can even carry out multiple runs with different loading densities to tackle both abundant and rare species. Mini-metagenomics uses a commercially available instrument, thereby facilitating its adoption by groups without expertise in microfluidic technologies. More importantly, because microfluidic-based mini-metagenomics provides orthogonal information to tetranucleotide or coverage information derived from traditional metagenomic sequencing, combining these approaches represents an exciting future direction for deriving a more comprehensive picture of the microbial world.</p></sec><sec id="s4" sec-type="materials|methods"><title>Materials and methods</title><sec id="s4-1"><title>Mock sample construction</title><p>The artificial bacterial community used to test the mini-metagenomic approach was constructed using five model species with different GC content provided by the Joint Genome Institute (<xref ref-type="table" rid="tbl1">Table 1</xref>).

Approximately equal number of cells were combined to create an artificial mixed population. Ultrapure glycerol (Invitrogen) was immediately added to the mixture at 30% and stored at −80°C.

Priming the C1 IFC involved filling all microfluidic control channels with C1 Harvest Reagent, all capture sites with C1 Blocking Reagent, and the input multiplexer with C1 Preloading Reagent. These reagents were available in all C1 Single-Cell Reagent Kits. The diluted environmental sample was loaded onto the chip using a modified version of the loading protocol where washing was not performed, as the capture sites were too large for microbial cells.

Following cell loading, whole genome amplification via MDA was performed on-chip in 96 independent reactions. A lysozyme (Epicenter) digestion step was added before alkaline denaturation of DNA. After alkaline denaturation of DNA, neutralization and MDA were performed (Qiagen REPLI-g single cell kit) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1C</xref>).

For every protein, alignments were built with MAFFT (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Katoh and Standley, 2013</xref>) (v7.294b) using the local pair option (mafft-linsi) and subsequently trimmed with trimAl 1.4 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Capella-Gutiérrez et al., 2009</xref>), removing sites for which more than 90 percent of taxa contained a gap. Query genomes lacking a substantial proportion of marker proteins (less than 28) or which had additional copies of more than one single-copy marker were removed from the data set. In total 17 of 29 Yellowstone hot spring genomes contained sufficient number of marker genes to be included in the tree. Single protein alignments were then concatenated resulting in an alignment of 51,239 sites. Maximum likelihood phylogenies were inferred with ExaML (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Kozlov et al., 2015</xref>) (version 3.0) using the GAMMA model for rate heterogeneity among sites and the LG substitution matrix (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Le and Gascuel, 2008</xref>) and 300 non-parametric bootstraps. The resulting phylogenetic tree was visualized in ete3 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Huerta-Cepas et al., 2016</xref>).</p></sec><sec id="s4-10"><title>Comparison to shotgun metagenomics</title><p>Bulk genomic DNA were extracted from Yellowstone National Park hot spring samples using Qiagen’s blood and tissue kit using the protocol for DNA extraction from gram positive bacteria. Nextera V2 libraries were constructed and sequenced on Illumina’s Nextseq platform. 32.5 million and 51.4 million reads were obtained from Bijah Spring and Mound Spring samples and trimmed using the same parameters as the mini-metagenomic sequencing reads. Finally, assembly is performed using Megahit (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Li et al., 2015</xref>), with default options and kmer values of 21, 31, 41, 51, 61, 71. At the same time, we combined all mini-metagenomic reads from sub-samples and down sampled to the same depth randomly as the shotgun metagenomic sequencing experiments and performed re-assembly using SPAdes.</p></sec><sec id="s4-11"><title>Analysis of genes involved in energy metabolism</title><p>From each genomic bin, ORFs assigned KO terms during the annotation process were mapped to all KEGG module involved in energy metabolism. For each KEGG module, we counted the number of KO terms extracted from a particular genome as a ratio of all KO terms present in the module. We did not normalize for genome size or completeness because doing so would artificially increase the importance of genes identified from smaller genomes.</p></sec><sec id="s4-12"><title>Assessment of genome completeness and abundance</title><p>Genome completeness and marker gene duplication (incorporation of contigs that may not belong to the genome) were quantified via CheckM (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Parks et al., 2015</xref>). Genome abundance was quantified using contig presence patterns. If more than 50% of the contigs from a particular genome bin were supported by at least one read in a sub-sample, we concluded that there was at least 1 cell in that sub-sample. Otherwise, zero cells were present in that sub-sample. Because a well-mixed cell suspension was originally loaded into the C1 IFC, cells were distributed into these microfluidic chambers (which we call sub-samples) randomly and independently. Hence, the problem of quantifying genome abundance can be simplified into the problem of inferring the total number of randomly distributed cells in all <bold>n</bold> sub-samples given that <bold>k</bold> sub-samples contained zero cells. This problem calls for the use of the Poisson distribution. Based on Poisson distribution, assuming we know <bold>X</bold>, the total number of cells with a particular genome contained in all <bold>n</bold> sub-samples, the expected number of sub-samples <bold>k</bold> without cells of that genome is denoted by<disp-formula id="equ2"><mml:math id="m2"><mml:mrow><mml:mfrac><mml:mi>k</mml:mi><mml:mi>n</mml:mi></mml:mfrac><mml:mo>=</mml:mo><mml:msup><mml:mi>e</mml:mi><mml:mrow><mml:mo>−</mml:mo><mml:mfrac><mml:mi>X</mml:mi><mml:mi>n</mml:mi></mml:mfrac></mml:mrow></mml:msup></mml:mrow></mml:math></disp-formula></p><p>Then for each genome, the total number of cells <bold>X</bold> contained in all <bold>n</bold> sub-samples can be computed with the following expression.<disp-formula id="equ3"><mml:math id="m3"><mml:mstyle displaystyle="true" scriptlevel="0"><mml:mrow><mml:mi>X</mml:mi><mml:mo>=</mml:mo><mml:mo>−</mml:mo><mml:mi>n</mml:mi><mml:mo>×</mml:mo><mml:mrow><mml:mi mathvariant="normal">l</mml:mi><mml:mi mathvariant="normal">n</mml:mi></mml:mrow><mml:mfrac><mml:mi>k</mml:mi><mml:mi>n</mml:mi></mml:mfrac></mml:mrow></mml:mstyle></mml:math></disp-formula></p><p>In our experiment, for each genome, the number of sub-samples containing zero cells representing that particular genome was tabulated and the most probable number of cells sampled in the microfluidic device was computed via the equation below.<disp-formula id="equ4"><mml:math id="m4"><mml:mstyle displaystyle="true" scriptlevel="0"><mml:mrow><mml:mi>C</mml:mi><mml:mi>e</mml:mi><mml:mi>l</mml:mi><mml:mi>l</mml:mi><mml:mtext> </mml:mtext><mml:mi>N</mml:mi><mml:mi>u</mml:mi><mml:mi>m</mml:mi><mml:mi>b</mml:mi><mml:mi>e</mml:mi><mml:mi>r</mml:mi><mml:mo>=</mml:mo><mml:mo>−</mml:mo><mml:mtext> </mml:mtext><mml:mrow><mml:mo>(</mml:mo><mml:mrow><mml:mi>N</mml:mi><mml:mi>u</mml:mi><mml:mi>m</mml:mi><mml:mi>b</mml:mi><mml:mi>e</mml:mi><mml:mi>r</mml:mi><mml:mtext> </mml:mtext><mml:mi>o</mml:mi><mml:mi>f</mml:mi><mml:mtext> </mml:mtext><mml:mi>s</mml:mi><mml:mi>u</mml:mi><mml:mi>b</mml:mi><mml:mi>s</mml:mi><mml:mi>a</mml:mi><mml:mi>m</mml:mi><mml:mi>p</mml:mi><mml:mi>l</mml:mi><mml:mi>e</mml:mi><mml:mi>s</mml:mi></mml:mrow><mml:mo>)</mml:mo></mml:mrow><mml:mo>×</mml:mo><mml:mtext> </mml:mtext><mml:mrow><mml:mi mathvariant="normal">l</mml:mi><mml:mi mathvariant="normal">n</mml:mi></mml:mrow><mml:mrow><mml:mo>(</mml:mo><mml:mfrac><mml:mrow><mml:mi>N</mml:mi><mml:mi>u</mml:mi><mml:mi>m</mml:mi><mml:mi>b</mml:mi><mml:mi>e</mml:mi><mml:mi>r</mml:mi><mml:mtext> </mml:mtext><mml:mi>o</mml:mi><mml:mi>f</mml:mi><mml:mtext> </mml:mtext><mml:mi>s</mml:mi><mml:mi>u</mml:mi><mml:mi>b</mml:mi><mml:mi>s</mml:mi><mml:mi>a</mml:mi><mml:mi>m</mml:mi><mml:mi>p</mml:mi><mml:mi>l</mml:mi><mml:mi>e</mml:mi><mml:mi>s</mml:mi><mml:mtext> </mml:mtext><mml:mi>w</mml:mi><mml:mi>i</mml:mi><mml:mi>t</mml:mi><mml:mi>h</mml:mi><mml:mtext> </mml:mtext><mml:mi>z</mml:mi><mml:mi>e</mml:mi><mml:mi>r</mml:mi><mml:mi>o</mml:mi><mml:mtext> </mml:mtext><mml:mi>c</mml:mi><mml:mi>e</mml:mi><mml:mi>l</mml:mi><mml:mi>l</mml:mi><mml:mi>s</mml:mi></mml:mrow><mml:mrow><mml:mi>N</mml:mi><mml:mi>u</mml:mi><mml:mi>m</mml:mi><mml:mi>b</mml:mi><mml:mi>e</mml:mi><mml:mi>r</mml:mi><mml:mtext> </mml:mtext><mml:mi>o</mml:mi><mml:mi>f</mml:mi><mml:mtext> </mml:mtext><mml:mi>s</mml:mi><mml:mi>u</mml:mi><mml:mi>b</mml:mi><mml:mi>s</mml:mi><mml:mi>a</mml:mi><mml:mi>m</mml:mi><mml:mi>p</mml:mi><mml:mi>l</mml:mi><mml:mi>e</mml:mi><mml:mi>s</mml:mi></mml:mrow></mml:mfrac><mml:mo>)</mml:mo></mml:mrow></mml:mrow></mml:mstyle></mml:math></disp-formula></p></sec><sec id="s4-13"><title>Assessment of genome variation</title><p>SNPs (Single Nucleotide Polymorphism) were tabulated for all genomes from cells observed across all sub-samples by first aligning all reads to contigs in genome bins using samtools version 1.3 mpileup functionality with the –g flag (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Li, 2011</xref>). Then, bcftools was used to call SNPs. We used several criteria to ensure confidence of observed SNPs. First, a SNP must have a quality score larger than 180 based on reads from all sub-samples. The results were not affected if we increase the threshold to higher numbers. Second, we required five reads to support each SNP location from a sub-sample in order to determine if the genome recovered from that sub-sample contains the dominant or alternate allele. Finally, we required that the alternate allele appear as the only allele in at least one sub-sample. If a sub-sample was determined to be heterozygous for a particular allele with high confidence, it was counted as one dominant and one alternate allele because it likely resulted from multiple cells from the same microfluidic chamber. Based on ORF predications, we then classified each SNP as noncoding, synonymous, or nonsynonymous.</p></sec><sec id="s4-14"><title>Data availability</title><p>Fluidigm C1 IFC script and associated protocols for running the IFC and library preparation are available at <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://www.fluidigm.com/c1openapp/scripthub/script/2017-02/mini-metagenomics-qiagen-repli-1487066131753-8">https://www.fluidigm.com/c1openapp/scripthub/script/2017-02/mini-metagenomics-qiagen-repli-1487066131753-8</ext-link></p><p>Raw sequencing reads are available from NCBI SRA Run Selector under BioProject PRJNA378813.</p><p>Assembled and annotated contigs are available at <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://img.jgi.doe.gov/mer/">https://img.jgi.doe.gov/mer/</ext-link> under IMG Genome IDs 3300006068 and 3300006065.

Your article has been favorably evaluated by Wendy Garrett as the Senior Editor and Cameron Thrash (Reviewer #1) as the Reviewing Editor. The following individuals involved in review of your submission have also agreed to reveal their identity: Brett Baker (Reviewer #2) and Steven Giovannoni (Reviewer #3).</p><p>In general the reviewers were favorable towards publication of this work, but the reviewers have a number of concerns that they would like to see addressed first.</p><p><italic>Reviewer #1:</italic> </p><p>The authors present a novel use of microfluidic cell-sorting of microbial communities to facilitate a &quot;mini-metagenomics&quot; approach. I particularly like the combined use of statistics with physical separation in subsamples to refine the binning procedure. While I think this technique was vetted well and has great potential for future application, there are a number of conceptual and technical details I'd like to see fleshed out prior to publication.</p><p>Subsection “Microfluidic-based mini-metagenomics enables contig binning based on co-occurrence patterns”, third paragraph: Please detail the criteria for taxonomic lineage assignment. How many genes per contig were required to have the same taxonomic assignment for that contig to be declared part of that group? At what level of taxonomic assignment did that hold (phylum, class, etc.)?

Those interested in the use of single-cell genomics (SCG) for the exploration of microbial communities, may consider this to be a viable and possibly much more practical approach than some SCG methods. In this regard, it is a very useful methods paper that addresses a technical deficit in the ability of microbial ecologists with limited funds, space, or personnel who may wish to perform SCG (or SCG-like) analyses in conjunction with metagenomics.</p></body></sub-article><sub-article article-type="reply" id="SA2"><front-stub><article-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.26580.027</article-id><title-group><article-title>Author response</article-title></title-group></front-stub><body><p><italic>Reviewer #1:</italic> </p><p><italic>The authors present a novel use of microfluidic cell-sorting of microbial communities to facilitate a &quot;mini-metagenomics&quot; approach.

The details of the metagenome annotation pipeline were outlined in Huntemann et al.’s work. In particular, USEARCH 6.0.294 was used to associate genes to KO terms if “there [was] at least 30% identity and at least 70% of the KO gene sequence [was] covered by the alignment”. The top USEARCH hit for each gene was used to assign phylogenetic lineage to contigs. When at least 30% of the genes had USEARCH hits, the assigned phylogenetic lineage was the last common ancestor of USEARCH hits. Therefore, more contigs were unassigned at lower taxonomic levels. Since we used contigs over 10 kbp, most taxonomic assignments were based on contigs with 7 or more genes. We added a statement that taxonomic assignment was performed by JGI’s IMG/ER metagenome annotation pipeline in the third paragraph of the subsection “Microfluidic-based mini-metagenomics enables contig binning based on co-occurrence patterns” with reference to Huntemann et al.’s paper.</p><p><italic>Subsection “Microfluidic-based mini-metagenomics enables contig binning based on co-occurrence patterns”, last paragraph: Did the single copy marker gene tree agree with the CheckM tree?

The contig and genome phylogenetic assignments were produced by JGI’s IMG/ER metagenome annotation pipeline described by Huntemann et al., except for those genomes with predominantly unassigned contigs. The phylogenetic assignments of 4 unassigned genomes were determined from marker gene based tree (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4</xref>) and the other two were determined using selected single marker gene trees (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s1">Figure 4—figure supplement 1</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s2">2</xref>).

Although the mini-metagenomic approach was not designed to improve the gene prediction and annotation results, in point of fact the ability to generate longer contigs and contigs from less abundant genomes facilitates the discovery and annotation of genes from rare cells. The comparison between genes found in Bijah Spring and Mound Spring in terms of methane metabolism is novel, especially since such differences could often be attributed to specific genomes. The reviewer also noted our mentioning of <italic>Euryarchaeota</italic> carrying nitrogen fixation genes. We would like to correct this error because in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5B</xref>, the <italic>Bathyarchaeota</italic> genome (Mound #14) is the one that carries the <italic>nif</italic> genes (subsection “Functional analyses reveal dominant energy metabolism in Yellowstone hot spring samples”, first paragraph).

[Please consider and address] Has there been any investigation into whether cell size/morphology biases the microfluidic process?</italic> </p><p>Size limitations or bias can arise when the cells start to approach the smallest channel dimension in size. The particular C1 IFC we used has large capture sites designed for mammalian cells (used to capture cells 17-25 μm in diameter), and the channels are too large to selectively capture microbial (bacterial or archaeal) cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Author response image 1</xref>). Because a well-mixed cell suspension was originally loaded into the C1 IFC, the microfluidic “capture sites” acted as chambers where cells were distributed randomly and independently. Hence, the problem of quantifying genome abundance can be simplified into the problem of inferring the total number of randomly distributed cells in all n sub-samples given that k sub-samples contained zero cells. We added text in the first paragraph of the subsection “Microfluidic-based mini-metagenomics facilitates assessment of genome abundance and population diversity with single-cell resolution” to explain justification for using the Poisson distribution to estimate this process. We also included a more detailed description in the “Assessment of genome completeness and abundance” subsection of Materials and methods.<fig id="fig7" position="float"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.26580.025</object-id><label>Author response image 1.</label><caption><p><bold>DOI:</bold> <ext-link ext-link-type="doi" xlink:href="10.7554/eLife.26580.025">http://dx.doi.org/10.7554/eLife.26580.025</ext-link></p></caption><graphic mime-subtype="x-tiff" mimetype="image" xlink:href="elife-26580-resp-fig1-v1"/></fig></p><p><italic>Subsection “Microfluidic-based mini-metagenomics facilitates assessment of genome abundance and population diversity with single-cell resolution”, first paragraph: Please describe how well the abundance of the organisms in the mini-metagenomics process reflects the abundance of these organisms in the original samples.

Shotgun metagenomic abundance was computed by counting the number of shotgun reads mapped to genomes generated using mini-metagenomics. All abundance profiles were normalized by the total, resulting in a measure of relative abundance. In general, shotgun derived relative abundance patterns matched those derived via mini-metagenomic cell counting. The agreement was better for Mound Spring genomes. For less abundant genomes, the mini-metagenomic method was more sensitive. These were likely due to “lucky” cells that made it into the sub-samples. We also added a short description in the main text describing this comparison (subsection “Microfluidic-based mini-metagenomics facilitates assessment of genome abundance and population diversity with single-cell resolution”, first paragraph).</p><p><italic>Subsection “Microfluidic-based mini-metagenomics facilitates assessment of genome abundance and population diversity with single-cell resolution”, last paragraph: How confident are the authors in using SNP determination and dN/dS ratios on genomes that are only binned at the phylum level?

Because it seems to me that if the genome represents an amalgamation of data from multiple genetic lineages within a phylum, SNP and dN/dS information could be misleading.</italic> </p><p>We believe that the binned genomes represent single species. To support this claim, we looked at binned genomes from both springs that had more than 50% of the contigs with phylogenetic lineage assignments at the species level (Table below). We see that among these genomes, almost all contigs were assigned to the same species (i.e. contigs were either unassigned at the species level or assigned to the same species). There were two genomes with high levels of specificity at genus level assignments: <italic>Methanobacterium</italic> and <italic>Thermodesulfobacterium</italic>. For these two genomes, no species level assignments existed for most contigs, demonstrating that they likely represented novel species. Most contigs in the other genomes were unassigned at higher taxonomic levels, making it convenient to refer to them by their phylum level assignments. However, based on previous evidence, these genomes should still represent single lineages. Therefore, we believe that the SNP quantification and dN/dS calculations on the genomes are valid.
