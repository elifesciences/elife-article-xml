thus obscuring true phenotypic relationships. Here, we devised a microfluidics system to characterize multiple phenotypes in single yeast cells over time before, during, and after salt stress. The system measured cell and colony size, growth rate, and cell-cycle phase along with nuclear trans-localization of two transcription factors: stress-activated Msn2 that regulates defense genes and Dot6 that represses ribosome biogenesis genes during an active stress response. By tracking cells dynamically, we discovered unexpected discordance between Msn2 and Dot6 behavior that revealed subpopulations of cells with distinct growth properties. Surprisingly, post-stress growth recovery was positively corelated with activation of the Dot6 repressor. In contrast, cells lacking Dot6 displayed slower growth acclimation, even though they grow normally in the absence of stress. We show that wild-type cells with a larger Dot6 response display faster production of Msn2-regulated Ctt1 protein, separable from the contribution of Msn2. These results are consistent with the model that transcriptional repression during acute stress in yeast provides a protective response, likely by redirecting translational capacity to induced transcripts.</p></abstract><kwd-group kwd-group-type="author-keywords"><kwd>stress response</kwd><kwd>fitness</kwd><kwd>heterogeneity</kwd><kwd>cell signaling</kwd><kwd>yeast</kwd></kwd-group><kwd-group kwd-group-type="research-organism"><title>Research organism</title><kwd><italic>S. cerevisiae</italic></kwd></kwd-group><funding-group><award-group id="fund1"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000001</institution-id><institution>National Science Foundation</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>1715324</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Gasch</surname><given-names>Audrey P</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund2"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000861</institution-id><institution>Burroughs Wellcome Fund</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>1R35GM128873</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>McClean</surname><given-names>Megan N</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund3"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100001677</institution-id><institution>National Institute of Health and Medical Research</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>R01CA229532</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Gasch</surname><given-names>Audrey P</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><funding-statement>The funders had no role in study design, data collection and interpretation, or the decision to submit the work for publication.</funding-statement></funding-group><custom-meta-group><custom-meta specific-use="meta-only"><meta-name>Author impact statement</meta-name><meta-value>Counterintuitively, activation of the transcriptional repressor of growth-promoting genes is important for yeast cell acclimation to salt stress, such that cells with larger activation of the repressor tend to have faster growth acclimation after stress.</meta-value></custom-meta></custom-meta-group></article-meta></front><body><sec id="s1" sec-type="intro"><title>Introduction</title><p>All organisms respond to cellular stress, which can arise from external conditions such as drugs and environmental shifts or internal perturbations including mutation and disease. Thus, at the cellular level, organisms must be able to sense both external and internal signals to mount a proper response. Yet in both single- and multi-celled organisms, there can be large variation in how individual cells respond to environmental stress, even among genetically identical cells in the same environment. For example, cell-to-cell variation in signaling and gene expression have been linked to differential survival of isogenic cancer cells responding to drugs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">Lee et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib46">Paek et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib53">Shaffer et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Inde and Dixon, 2018</xref>). Similarly, cellular heterogeneity in bacterial growth and gene expression can produce variation in survival upon antibiotic treatment (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Balaban et al., 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">Keren et al., 2004</xref>). Understanding the nature of this variation could facilitate the modulation of stress survival, with therapeutic applications.</p><p>One marker of heterogeneity in stress responses is dynamic localization of stress-activated transcription factors. Several canonical factors, including p53 in mammalian cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib48">Purvis et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">Kracikova et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib46">Paek et al., 2016</xref>) and Msn2 and its paralog Msn4 in fungi (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Görner et al., 1998</xref>), reside in the cytosol in the absence of stress but rapidly translocate to the nucleus upon activation. These and other stress-activated factors can vary substantially in their responsiveness, in ways that can impact cellular outputs including gene-expression. For example, Msn2 localization dynamics differ depending on the nature of the stress (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Hao and O’Shea, 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib47">Petrenko et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Granados et al., 2018</xref>), and these differences impart distinct effects on different target genes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Hao and O’Shea, 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Hansen and O’Shea, 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib55">Stewart-Ornstein et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Hansen and O’Shea, 2015a</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Hansen and O’Shea, 2015b</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Hansen and O’Shea, 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Hansen and Zechner, 2021</xref>). Msn2 targets with highly responsive promoters can be induced even with brief pulses of nuclear Msn2, whereas genes with less responsive promoters require prolonged Msn2 activation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Hansen and O’Shea, 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Hansen and O’Shea, 2015a</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Hansen and O’Shea, 2015b</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Hansen and O’Shea, 2016</xref>). Similarly, differences in the dynamics of p53 localization can lead to distinct transcriptional outputs, and these distinctions correlate with differences in stress survival (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib48">Purvis et al., 2012</xref>). Several studies have observed substantial cell-to-cell heterogeneity in nuclear localization dynamics of these factors (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Cai et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Cheong et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib49">Purvis and Lahav, 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib42">Lin et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">AkhavanAghdam et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Gasch et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Granados et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib41">Li et al., 2018</xref>); however, the causes and functional effects of this variation remain poorly understood.</p><p>Cell-to-cell variation in transcription factor localization dynamics could arise for several reasons. Changes in the state of a single transcription factor may alter its localization independent of or separable from the cellular system (defined as factor-specific variation). In contrast, activity-state changes in the upstream signaling networks or cellular system itself could produce coordinated activation of the stress response (referred to as systemic variation). Distinguishing between local versus systemic variation has been difficult, since most studies to date have followed only single transcription factors. We recently developed strains in which two differentially tagged transcription factors regulated by the same signaling network are expressed in the same yeast cell. Msn2 activator fused to mCherry is co-expressed with the transcriptional repressor Dot6 fused to GFP. Both factors help to coordinate the yeast environmental stress response (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Gasch et al., 2000</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Causton et al., 2001</xref>): whereas Msn2 activates defense genes that are induced in the ESR (iESR genes), Dot6 represses growth-promoting genes involved in ribosome biogenesis that are correspondingly repressed in the ESR during stress (rESR genes) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib43">Lippman and Broach, 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Bergenholm et al., 2018</xref>). Both factors are controlled by the Protein Kinase A (PKA) and mTOR pathways, which are generally associated with promoting growth (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1A</xref>): PKA/TOR-dependent phosphorylation of Msn2 and Dot6 maintains the factors in the cytosol, whereas Msn2 and Dot6 dephosphorylation after PKA/TOR inhibition leads to their nuclear localization (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Görner et al., 1998</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib54">Smith et al., 1998</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib43">Lippman and Broach, 2009</xref>). Thus, we expect the two factors to be coordinated in their localization when the stress response is activated systemically but discordant in response to factor-specific differences in regulation.</p><fig-group><fig id="fig1" position="float"><label>Figure 1.</label><caption><title>Experimental approach.</title><p>(<bold>A</bold>) Schematic of Msn2 and Dot6 localization in the absence (left) and presence (right) of stress.

The change in pixel area was highly linear for most cells (median R<sup>2</sup>=0.92, grey box plot). To test the robustness to time points considered, we performed a sliding-window analysis in which growth rates were calculated from subsets of timepoints. The linear fit remained high, and estimated growth rates were well correlated with the growth rates calculated from all pre-stress timepoints.

(<bold>E</bold>) As might be expected, growth rate of cells that recovered growth after NaCl stress were well estimated by a linear change in colony area, whereas cells that did not recover pre-stress growth rates showed a lower linear fit that was more heavily influenced by noise (confirmed by visual inspection). (<bold>F</bold>) The reduction in growth rate seen after NaCl treatment (here as in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2B</xref>, blue plot) were specific to stress treatment (median ln(growth rate change)=–0.85), since most cells exposed to a shift in media without NaCl (grey bars) showed subtle changes in growth rate (median ln(growth rate change)=–0.20). Together, these analyses show that our estimates of growth rate are robust to time points used and that growth-rate changes discussed in the text are specific to NaCl stress.</p></caption><graphic mimetype="image" mime-subtype="tiff" xlink:href="elife-82017-fig1-figsupp2-v2.tif"/></fig></fig-group><p>The challenges in distinguishing factor-specific versus systemic variation have obscured how systemic activation of the stress response relates to other physiological responses. One important factor is growth rate. Growth rate and stress tolerance are competing interests in the cell and are often antagonistically regulated: fast growing cells tend to be the most susceptible to stress and toxins, whereas slow growing or quiescent cells generally survive extreme conditions (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Balaban et al., 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib44">Lu et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib58">Zakrzewska et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib40">Levy et al., 2012</xref>). Part of this antagonistic correlation is thought to be controlled, at least under specific situations, by the RAS-PKA pathway, which promotes growth and suppresses the stress response (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib54">Smith et al., 1998</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Gasch et al., 2000</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib59">Zaman et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib60">Zaman et al., 2009</xref>). <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib41">Li et al., 2018</xref> used single-cell microscopy to show that slower growing cells in an isogenic culture displayed lower levels of the PKA allosteric activator cAMP and that artificial activation of PKA diminished the slow growing population (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib41">Li et al., 2018</xref>). They further showed a slight but statistically significant negative correlation between Msn2 nuclear localization and micro-colony growth over the subsequent 10 hr in the absence of stress. This suggests that activation of Msn2 is coupled to reduced growth rate, a theory put forward and debated in other bulk-culture studies (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib50">Regenberg et al., 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Castrillo et al., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Brauer et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Ho et al., 2018</xref>). The inability to distinguish between factor-specific variation and systemic activation of the stress response likely obscures the true relationship with growth.</p><p>Here, we monitored dynamic localization changes of both Msn2 and Dot6 in the same yeast cells, along with a panel of other single-cell measurements, to dissect local and systemic variation and illuminate the relationship between ESR activation and growth rate. We optimized a microfluidics system that can monitor single-cell localization levels and dynamics of both Msn2-mCherry and Dot6-GFP along with single-cell and colony growth rates, size, shape, cell-cycle phase and size changes before and after an acute dose of sodium chloride (NaCl) as a model stressor. Our results revealed several insights, including surprising levels of discordance in Msn2 and Dot6 activation that partly explained variation in post-stress growth rate. We developed a multi-factorial model explaining cell growth rate after stress acclimation to demonstrate that stress acclimation is partly predictable based on prior cellular states. Remarkably, one of the important predictors is the activation level of the Dot6 repressor, which counterintuitively is associated with faster growth acclimation and faster production of stress-induced catalase Ctt1. We discuss implications of this work for understanding how cellular state and transcriptional repression influence stress responses.</p></sec><sec id="s2" sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><p>We optimized a microfluidics system that could measure nuclear localization dynamics as well as one- and two-cell colony growth rates before and after exposure to 0.7 M NaCl (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1B</xref> and Methods). Using this system, we characterized the variation in cell responses for 72 min before and 144 min after exposure to NaCl, which induces ionic and osmotic stress, in biological triplicates done on separate days. This time frame captures phenotypic variation in cells growing in the absence of stress, during the acute stress-response phase (from 0 to 54 min after osmotic stress), and over later timepoints as cells acclimate to continuous NaCl. Microscopy imaging and analysis reports on Msn2-mCherry and Dot6-GFP nuclear localization dynamics in the same cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1C</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1</xref>). We used MATLAB scripts to identify nuclear translocation events, which we refer to as ‘peaks’ in the traces (see Methods). We also measured cell and colony growth phenotypes, including colony size, colony growth rates (defined by increase in pixel number of masked colony area and vetted with several analyses, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s2">Figure 1—figure supplement 2</xref>) both before and after stress, and change in cell size due to volume loss upon NaCl stress (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1D</xref> and Methods). We used the relative change in colony area over time, collapsed from multiple z-stack images per time point, as a proxy for growth rate. One limitation is that growth by this estimation will be under-estimated for cells that bud perpendicular to the slide plane, introducing noise into the growth rate measurements for some cells. We limited our analysis to colonies of only one or two cells at the beginning of the time series and to cells that passed several quality-control filters (see Methods). In total, we analyzed 221 cells passing these filters, collected from the three independent biological replicates.</p><p>This system captured variation in all of the features measured. As expected based on previous studies (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib40">Levy et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Fehrmann et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Crane et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib41">Li et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">Jin et al., 2019</xref>), there was substantial variation in cellular growth rates before NaCl addition, confirming that cells vary considerably in their growth properties in the absence of stress (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2A</xref>). Most colonies reduced their growth rate in response to NaCl stress (but not a mock treatment, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s2">Figure 1—figure supplement 2F</xref>), but once again there was substantial variation: some cells showed dramatic growth reduction upon NaCl, whereas others showed little to no change (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2B</xref>).

We noticed that cells in Clusters 2 and 3 showed elevated levels of mCherry that persisted over time compared to other cells. Closer inspection of the microscopy images suggested that some of the signal may not reflect nuclear translocation but instead was likely vacuolar signal (see more below).

We considered multiple metrics for summarizing pre-stress nuclear localization, including AUC (which is a measure of the overall nuclear abundance) and the sum of called translocation peak heights (which is influenced by the magnitude and frequency of pre-stress pulses), along with acute-stress translocation peak height and AUC during the acclimation phase. The model also incorporated other cell features including pre-stress growth rate, cell-cycle phase at the time of NaCl exposure, and cell size factors (See ‘Model 1’ in <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="supp3">Supplementary file 3</xref> for all parameters used). Factors that did not contribute significantly (adjusted p&gt;0.05) were progressively removed until the variance explain decreased (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="supp3">Supplementary file 3</xref>). The final regression identified four factors that contributed significantly to explain post-stress rate (‘Model 3’ in <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="supp3">Supplementary file 3</xref>): pre-stress AUC of Dot6 nuclear localization, the sum of pre-stress Msn2 peak heights, the pre-stress growth rate of the cells, and the magnitude of Dot6 nuclear localization change immediately after NaCl. Together, these factors – all but one of which represent pre-stress cellular phenotypes – explained 35% of the variance in post-stress growth rate (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6C</xref>), nearly doubling the explanatory power of any single feature alone. We note that noise in the growth-rate measurements is likely diminishing the true fit, such that the explanatory power reported here is actually an under-estimate.</p><p>One challenge is that several of these phenotypes could be co-variants of an underlying hidden variable or cellular state. For example, both pre-stress growth rate and Dot6 acute-stress peak height correlate with post-stress growth rate, but they also correlate with each other: cells growing faster before stress have a larger Dot6 stress-response. The mixed-linear model reports that both factors contribute separable predictive power, and indeed together they explain more of the variance in stress acclimation than either factor alone. Nonetheless, to further disentangle their co-variation, we applied principal component (PC) regression. We first analyzed the four statistically-significant model-input variables in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6B</xref> by PCA and then used the resulting components as factors in a linear model of post-stress growth rates (see Methods). PC1 and PC3 together explained 21% of the variance in post-stress growth rate: both captured co-variation in pre-stress growth rate, acute-stress Dot6 response, and pre-stress transcription factor behaviors, indicating that these features likely reflect the same aspects of the cellular state (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6D</xref>). However, PC4 that is dominated by Dot6 behavior but not influenced by pre-stress growth rate explained an additional 14% of growth acclimation (p=1e-4). A fourth component, PC2, was dominated by pre-stress Msn2 behavior but showed no power to predict post-stress growth acclimation rates. Thus, behavior of the Dot6 repressor independently correlates with post-stress growth rate. As further confirmation, we analyzed the correlation between Dot6 acute-stress peak height and post-stress acclimation in a subset of cells with similar pre-stress growth rates. Indeed, pre-stress growth rate had no predictive power for this subset of cells, whereas Dot6 peak height explained 12% of the variance (p=1e-4, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6s2">Figure 6—figure supplement 2</xref>). Thus, the behavior of the Dot6 repressor during acute NaCl stress is associated with growth recovery as cells acclimate (see Discussion).</p></sec><sec id="s2-5"><title>Dot6 activation is associated with faster production of Ctt1 protein</title><p>Dot6 is the transcriptional repressor of growth-promoting ribosome biogenesis (RiBi) genes; thus, its positive association with post-stress growth rate may seem counterintuitive.

Cellular Ctt1 levels (defined as maximum iRFP signal normalized to pre-stress levels, see Methods) were correlated with both Msn2 and Dot6 peak heights (but not their pre- or post-stress behaviors). However, the explanatory power was significantly higher when considering the timing of Ctt1 production. We defined the time for Ctt1-iRFP levels to cross a change threshold (see Methods). Even for cells that reached the same maximal Ctt1 levels, the time to get there varied (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7B</xref>).

Our results reveal much more complexity in Msn2 and Dot6 behavior than previously recognized, that the relative activation of these factors along with other pre-stress phenotypes can partly predict cellular outcomes including growth acclimation, and that behavior of the Dot6 repressor influences post-stress growth rate and the dynamics of a downstream response. Below we discuss implications of these results.</p><sec id="s3-1"><title>Complexities in Msn2 dynamics reflect diversity in stress-responsive states</title><p>Past studies focusing on aggregate analysis of all single cells in the population reported condition-specific dynamical behavior of Msn2, such as prolonged nuclear pulsing after glucose starvation versus a burst of activation before acclimating to osmotic stress (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Hao and O’Shea, 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib47">Petrenko et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">AkhavanAghdam et al., 2016</xref>). Elegant studies by Hansen et al. used artificial activation of Msn2 (through chemical inhibition of PKA activity) to show that these differences in Msn2 nuclear translocation dynamics produce different transcriptional outputs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Hansen and O’Shea, 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Hansen and O’Shea, 2015a</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Hansen and O’Shea, 2015b</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Hansen and O’Shea, 2016</xref>). Target-gene promoters display different dependencies on the amplitude, frequency, and duration of Msn2 nuclear translocation, such that distinctions in Msn2 behavior activate different sets of genes. Comparable studies of regulators in mammalian systems also reported stress-specific differences in the dynamics of nuclear translocation, which correspond to differences in gene activation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib48">Purvis et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">Kracikova et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib46">Paek et al., 2016</xref>). One limitation of the approach of Hansen et al. is that activating Msn2 by wholesale inhibition of PKA likely loses much of the heterogeneity seen in natural responses. Our study thus provides an important complement to artificial system activation.</p><p>In fact, our analysis revealed highly varied responses across subpopulations of cells responding to the same stress stimulus. Some cells responded to the osmotic/ionic stress induced by NaCl with a large nuclear pulse of Msn2 followed by near complete acclimation, as previously reported for sorbitol-induced osmotic stress – but other cells showed extensive and prolonged Msn2 fluctuations during the acclimation phase, akin to what has been reported for glucose starvation. These subpopulations are obscured by aggregate analysis but have important implications, since the different dynamics of Msn2 (and likely also Dot6) activation produce different transcriptomic outputs, even for cells responding to the same stressor in the same environment. This hypothesis is consistent with past work from our lab investigating single-cell transcriptomics, in which isogenic cells in the same culture displayed different transcriptomes upon NaCl stress, including for ESR genes, indicating that they experience the stress differently (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Gasch et al., 2017</xref>).</p></sec><sec id="s3-2"><title>The Dot6 repressor provides a protective response during stress</title><p>Although the variety in Msn2 responses likely has important consequences on downstream gene expression, we were surprised to find little connection to growth rate, at least in the short time frames studied here. Instead, the response of Dot6 explained a much larger fraction of the variance in post-stress growth rate, when considered alone or in the multi-factor linear model (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6</xref> and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="supp3">Supplementary file 3</xref>). Cells with a larger Dot6 response during the acute-stress phase showed faster production of Ctt1, separable from Msn2 activity (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7</xref>), and faster growth recovery during the acclimation phase. In contrast, cells completely lacking Dot6 and its paralog show delayed Ctt1 accumulation despite having more transcript (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Ho et al., 2018</xref>) and dramatically reduced post-stress acclimation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7A</xref>).</p><p>These results are consistent with our working model of Dot6 activity. At least in response to NaCl treatment, transcriptional repression does not lead to reduced abundance of the encoded proteins (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">Lee et al., 2011</xref>). Instead, we proposed that transcriptional repression helps to deplete the pool of RiBi transcripts that are normally highly transcribed and translated in actively growing cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">Lee et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Ho et al., 2018</xref>). In the absence of Dot6 repression, aberrantly abundant RiBi transcripts compete with induced mRNAs for available translational machinery, thereby delaying translation of stress-defense transcripts. In the case of NaCl, the limiting factor is unlikely to be ribosomes: we previously showed that this yeast strain exposed to the same dose of NaCl removes a population of ribosomes from the translating pool immediately after stress (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Ho et al., 2018</xref>). This is consistent with bacterial models of growth regulation, in which cells preserve some ribosomes for later stress acclimation (also indicating that growth rate under these conditions is not limited by ribosome availability) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib45">Mori et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Kim et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">Korem Kohanim et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib51">Remigi et al., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib57">Wu et al., 2022</xref>). Evidence from bacteria and incidental results in yeast suggest that other features related to translation elongation may limit cell growth in this situation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Dai et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Ho et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib57">Wu et al., 2022</xref>), a limitation that may be alleviated by removing some ribosomes from the translating pool. How all of this fits into broader cellular states is discussed below.</p></sec><sec id="s3-3"><title>Differences in pre-stress cellular states influence stress acclimation</title><p>Many studies have found significant variation in how cells respond to acute stress. Using our system and the conditions studied here, upwards of 35% of the variance in post-stress growth rate could be explained by a multi-factorial model that includes both pre-stress and acute-stress phenotypes. It will be interesting to see as technology develops for improved growth rate measurements if this fit improves further. The remaining unexplained variation is likely influenced by additional features of the cellular state, as well as stochastic effects. We found no connection to cell-cycle phase or cell size, although the lack of correlation could be masked by other confounders (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Barber et al., 2021</xref>). But one likely contributor is differences in pre-stress metabolic or mitochondrial states as implicated in several studies (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Fehrmann et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Gasch et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">Laporte et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Dhar et al., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Bagamery et al., 2020</xref>). Bagamery et al. showed that pre-stress fluctuations in fermentative versus respirative metabolism influence how cells recover from glucose starvation, with antagonistic fitness effects depending on the situation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Bagamery et al., 2020</xref>). Other studies linked variation in mitochondrial function and morphology to cell age and the ability to enter quiescence, which could also influence stress responsiveness (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Fehrmann et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">Laporte et al., 2018</xref>). An interesting avenue for future investigation would be to measure metabolic and mitochondrial states along with features studied here.</p><p>Regardless, our results are consistent with the fact that pre-stress cellular states influence how cells will respond to future stress. Some cells in our study were fast growing before stress, showed a larger Dot6 response during stress, and acclimated faster in terms of post-stress growth rate; in turn, cells that were slow growing before stress had lower pre-stress Dot6 activity, lower Dot6 activation during the acute phase, and a slower growth acclimation. One hypothesis is fast-growing cells may have higher biosynthetic capacity, and thus more need for ribosomes and higher transcription of RiBi genes. These cells may therefore need to slam on the brakes of RiBi production more strongly in order to free up translational capacity. Repression of RiBi transcripts in and of itself need not impact subsequent growth recovery, if cells already harbor ample ribosomes at the time of stress.</p><p>On the other hand, the size of the Dot6 acute-stress peak correlates with post-stress growth acclimation in a way that can be separated from pre-stress growth rate (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6C, D and</xref> – <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6s2">Figure 6—figure supplement 2</xref>). Thus, some cells may be growing at average rates but still require a large Dot6 response, for example if they are already somewhat limited in translational capacity for other reasons and therefore require a strong Dot6 response. Interestingly, pre-stress growth rate did not correlate with the time to cross the Ctt1 threshold (p=0.24), indicating that the correlation with Dot6 is independent. Future studies will be required to test these hypotheses. Interestingly, the Dot6 acute-stress peak height can be fairly well predicted by the <italic>relative</italic> pre-stress activity of Msn2 versus Dot6 (R<sup>2</sup>=0.42, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7s1">Figure 7—figure supplement 1</xref>), again linking acute-stress behavior to pre-stress cell states.</p><p>Our work adds to a growing body investigating the relationship between stress defense and growth rate. While we expected a relationship between coordinated Msn2/Dot6 activation and growth rate based on past studies (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Brauer et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Ho et al., 2018</xref>), we instead discovered unexpected discordance in the factors’ behavior and an unexpected association of acclimation growth rate and Dot6 activity, the opposite of what several past models predict (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib50">Regenberg et al., 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Castrillo et al., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Brauer et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Airoldi et al., 2009</xref>).

The mCherry signal was captured using a ET/mCH/TR single band filter cube (#96365, Chroma Technology Corp, Bellows Falls, Vermont excitation 560/40 x emission 630/75 m). In addition, exposure from a halogen lamp was used to capture white-light images of all cells.

The z-focal plane focus was set on the center of cells, and images were taken 1 μm above, at, and 1 μm below this center of focus, generating a three-image z-stack for each channel. The three-image z-stacks were collapsed into a single image by taking the maximum projection of the 3 images using a custom MATLAB script.</p><p>Cells were identified using a MATLAB circle-finding function on the brightfield images. Individual cells were then tracked through all images using the MATLAB <italic>simpletracker</italic> function (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib56">Tinevez, 2019</xref>). Cell colonies were defined by segmenting images into a binary black-and-white image, and single colonies were defined as enclosed masks. The number of cells within each colony was determined simply as the number of identified circles that overlapped with a given enclosed white area of the binary images. Pre-stress growth was scored by linear regression on colony size (defined as the total pixel number within the masked area of the colony) for the first twelve 6-min time points and reported as the natural log of the rate of increase. Post-stress growth was measured in the same manner for time points 20–29 (representing resumed growth at the beginning of the acclimation phase: 114–168 min into the time course). We note that our proxy for post-stress growth rate, taken as an indication of how well cells acclimate to salt stress, could also be influenced by differences in volume recovery for some cells, which may also be a feature of successful acclimation.</p><p>We applied several quality control filters to insure accuracy of growth rates. First, to ensure that colony growth rates were representative of nuclear localization dynamics within individual cells, we limited our analysis to colonies consisting of no more than two cells at the time points leading up to NaCl exposure. Most of these two-cell colonies represented mother/daughter cells and therefore had clear shared life histories. Second, in some cases a budding daughter cell was lost during the time-course, resulting in a misleading negative growth rate. Consequently, regressions resulting in negative slopes were excluded. Lastly, a visual inspection of individual colonies during the time course excluded colonies where new cells adhered to a given colony. Thirty cells were excluded from post-stress measures due to these cell adhesion issues that skewed colony size measures. Another six cells (2.7% of total cells) had no apparent post-stress growth and the calculated slope was therefore dominated by noise in pixel number. This resulted in either a negative or near zero slope and consequently did not provide an informative growth rate measure when taking the natural log of the change in colony size. Consequently, these six cells were also excluded from post-stress growth rate measures. Experiments with AGY1813 (n=3) had the same quality control filters applied to them, with an additional metric applied to exclude cells expressing persistent, high iRFP signal throughout the time course (11 cells). This resulted in an analysis of 228 cells.</p><p>Cell-cycle phase at the time of osmotic stress was measured by visual inspection of cell bud presence/size and nucleus location within the cell in accordance with standard yeast cell-cycle definitions (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Howell and Lew, 2012</xref>).

In order to estimate a threshold for a true peak of nuclear localization versus background noise, a linear regression was done on pre-stress nuclear localization time points to calculate the difference of each point from the regression line, resulting in a baseline standard deviation of localization values. Since from visual inspection of traces and cells there were many more true peaks for Dot6, the standard deviation for the Msn2-mCherry channel was used to calculate this baseline threshold for both Msn2 and Dot6. Specifically, two standard deviations from the mean of the distribution of was used as a threshold.

Model 5 measured the explained variance of the two most significant variables: Dot6 acute stress peak height and pre-stress growth rate. Trends and significance were the same when analyzing only single-cell colonies, except that the minor contribution of the sum of prestress Msn2 peaks to the original model was no longer significant.</p><p>For principle component regression (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6D</xref>), principle component analysis (PCA) was performed using <italic>pca</italic> in MATLAB on the 4 factors that had significant influence on post-stress growth rate (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6B</xref>, bold). The resulting PCA coefficients (i.e. the loadings) represent the contribution of each of these 4 factors to each PC. For each PC, the value of each coefficient was divided by the sum of coefficient values to give a fractional contribution of each factor to each PC (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Drummond et al., 2006</xref>). A linear model was then performed as described above, where the dependent variable, y, was again the post-stress growth rate, but the independent variables, x, were the resulting PCA scores for each of the 4 factors.</p></sec></sec></body><back><sec sec-type="additional-information" id="s5"><title>Additional information</title><fn-group content-type="competing-interest"><title>Competing interests</title><fn fn-type="COI-statement" id="conf1"><p>No competing interests declared</p></fn><fn fn-type="COI-statement" id="conf2"><p>No competing interests declared</p></fn></fn-group><fn-group content-type="author-contribution"><title>Author contributions</title><fn fn-type="con" id="con1"><p>Conceptualization, Data curation, Software, Formal analysis, Validation, Investigation, Visualization, Writing – original draft, Writing – review and editing</p></fn><fn fn-type="con" id="con2"><p>Data curation, Software, Formal analysis, Validation, Investigation, Visualization, Writing – review and editing</p></fn><fn fn-type="con" id="con3"><p>Resources</p></fn><fn fn-type="con" id="con4"><p>Resources, Methodology, Writing – review and editing</p></fn><fn fn-type="con" id="con5"><p>Conceptualization, Formal analysis, Supervision, Funding acquisition, Visualization, Writing – original draft, Project administration, Writing – review and editing</p></fn></fn-group></sec><sec sec-type="supplementary-material" id="s6"><title>Additional files</title><supplementary-material id="supp1"><label>Supplementary file 1.</label><caption><title>Permutations of coordinately timed peaks in cells in two-cell colonies.</title></caption><media xlink:href="elife-82017-supp1-v2.docx" mimetype="application" mime-subtype="docx"/></supplementary-material><supplementary-material id="supp2"><label>Supplementary file 2.</label><caption><title>Cell subpopulations are identified in multiple biological replicates.</title><p>The number of cells in each mclust cluster from <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4</xref> is shown along with the number of those cells from each of three biological replicates.

Your initial submission has been assessed by a Senior Editor in consultation with members of the Board of Reviewing Editors.

It is well-known that there is great heterogeneity among the responses of otherwise genetically identical single cells to stress. An interesting question therefore is to what extent is the heterogeneity is just random stochastic noise and to what extent is it &quot;hard-coded&quot; into the cell based on its recent prior history (e.g. expression of various proteins, cell-to-cell variation of protein abundances, prior stress response, etc).</p><p>Clearly both – random noise and prior life history – contribute. For example, it is well known that stochastic single molecule events can regulate cell fate (Choi, Cai, Frieda, Xie, Science, 2008), but it is also well-known that if you &quot;prime&quot; cells by exposing them to mild stress, then they respond much better to a subsequent high-intensity stress.</p><p>An interesting question then is, what is the relative contribution of random noise and prior life history? And for prior life history, what factors are most predictive?</p><p>The setup of this paper is pretty simple. They look at two well-known factors, Msn2 and Dot6, using a single type of stress (0.7M NaCl step function) and they then quantify various aspects, the 3 most important of which are: (1) Msn2 nuclear localization; (2) Dot6 nuclear localization; and (3) cell growth rate.</p><p>The key finding is that prior Dot6 activation is more predictive than Msn2, and that a model with more variables can predict more of the variance than for example a single factor.</p><p>While the authors test multiple factors, the overall amount of the variance that can be explained is modest – around 35% using the full linear model.</p><p>I don't have major technical concerns and the work generally seems to be well done. I think the two main issues are (1) I would like to see some control computational analyses to assess how robust their growth rate quantification is and (2) the size of the dataset is pretty small, just 221 cells. This is a concern especially since they have 11 clusters, some of which have very few cells in them, raising doubt about their conclusion.</p><p>For the 1st concern, I'd like the authors to do a mock experiment: grow cells without any stress and then arbitrarily set a boundary and do similar plots to Figure 2 to see how much change in growth rate they see without stress. This will allow us to understand how much of Figure 2 is true signal and how much is just quantification noise. This could either be a new experiment or re-analysis of existing data before the stress. I'd also like to see &quot;moving average growth rate&quot; plots for single cells – how meaningful is a single growth rate number? I'd also like to get more detail on how growth rate was calculated. If I understand correctly, the authors use cell size. This is very reasonable, but it is a challenging quantification: since volume scales with radius to the 3rd power, tiny errors in the estimation of the radius can result in massive changes in the estimation of the volume. What was the pixel size and did they do subpixel analysis?</p><p>In general, I'd like to see a comprehensive description of how they quantified cell growth as well as a comprehensive supplementary figure &quot;stress testing&quot; the robustness of their quantification.</p><p>This is important since the entire paper rests on the cell growth numbers being accurate.</p><p>For my second concern, I'd like the authors to test how robust their various results are to cell numbers. I suggest that they do subsampling, where they leave out 50% of their data/cells, repeat their analysis, and then iterate multiple times to assess if all of their conclusions are robust. For example, I am concerned about whether or not they have enough data to support 11 clusters. This type of subsampling approach should be informative, though I would like to see this approach applied to all of the major conclusions and analyses.</p><p>Since both of these concerns can be assessed using either purely more computational analysis and/or just with the addition of a very simple experiment, hopefully they should not be onerous to address.</p><p>My conceptual concern is whether or not the present paper is a major conceptual advance. The notions that prior life history affects how cells deal with a stress response as well as the observation of substantial heterogeneity in single cell stress responses, are both well-known in the field and similar observations have been made in yeast and other organisms. So, the major novel contributions seem to be the relative important of Dot6 and Msn2 (Dot6 is more predictive than Msn2, which at least I did not know), and a quantification of how much one can predict from Dot6 and Msn2. This is certainly a nice contribution, and the study seems to be generally performed in a thoughtful manner, but it is perhaps a modest conceptual advance given what is already known.</p><p><italic>Reviewer #2 (Recommendations for the authors):</italic></p><p>In this manuscript, Bergen et al. combined microfluidics and time-lapse imaging to monitor single-cell phenotypes in response to acute osmotic stress. In particular, they measured translocation dynamics of two transcription factors, Msn2 and Dot6, together with a series of cellular phenotypes, e.g. cell growth, cell size, cell cycle phase, etc. To make sense of these data, they classified single cells into clusters based on their Msn2 and Dot6 dynamics, and performed correlation analyses to quantify relative contributions of measured phenotypic factors (alone or in combination) to post-stress growth rate. They found that post-stress growth rate showed a stronger correlation with an integration of multiple factors (rather than each single factor alone), among which pre-stress growth rate and Dot6 peak height seem playing major roles.</p><p>The authors focused on an important question in the field – the cell-to-cell heterogeneity in stress response and the functional relevance to stress adaptation. The experimental approaches are not new but timely. Their clustering and correlation analyses suggest some interesting relationships between phenotypic factors and growth adaptation.</p><p>My concern is that the story seems incomplete and lacks any firm conclusions regarding causality or mechanisms. The paper relies completely on the correlation analyses, which could serve as a good starting point for a story, if followed with experimental validation (e.g. by perturbations) and mechanistic investigation. However, the authors decided to end the paper there, leaving the story incomplete and inconclusive. Therefore, a significant amount of further work will be needed to warrant publication of the paper in <italic>eLife</italic>.</p><p>Other concerns:</p><p>1. I find the title a bit misleading. &quot;Prior life history&quot; sounds like a cell's previous stress encounter, nutrient condition, or age, etc. However, in the paper, it seems referring specifically to Msn2/Dot6 dynamics and pre-stress growth rate during the 72-min baseline (no stress) period immediately before the stress treatment. Maybe &quot;pre-stress cellular state&quot; is more accurate than &quot;prior life history.&quot;</p><p>2. Figure S2, it seems pre-stress growth rate and Dot6 acute stress peak height are major contributing factors to post-stress growth rate. Is it possible that these two factors are mechanistically connected? Is there any correlation between these two factors? My concern here is whether these two factors can be simply combined into one factor, pre-stress growth rate or biogenesis capacity whereas Dot6 acute stress peak height simply depends on Dot6 protein expression level, reflective of cellular biogenesis capacity. If this is true, then an alternative interpretation of the correlation results will be that cell-to-cell variation in post-stress growth rate largely arises from variations in pre-stress growth rate or biogenesis capacity, which has long been known as a major source of extrinsic noise. Dot6 peak height and other phenotypic factors simply reflect pre-stress biogenesis capacity. This interpretation can also reconcile the contradiction that Dot6 peak height positively correlates with post-stress growth rate whereas Dot6 is a repressor of ribosomal biogenesis. A careful test of this possibility will be needed.</p><p><italic>Reviewer #3 (Recommendations for the authors):</italic></p><p>Bergen et al. study how the dynamic subcellular localizations of two stress-responsive transcription factors (Dot6 and Msn2) relate to variability in the growth of yeast cells before, during and after high-salt stress.</p><p>Previous studies (e.g., by the O'Shea lab) used microfluidics to look at subcellular dynamics of Msn2 and other transcription factors from a more mechanistic point of view. Other studies (e.g., Li et al. 2018 cited in the manuscript) used higher-throughput time-lapse imaging to look at population heterogeneity in growth, gene expression and stress tolerance. The present study is appealing because it sits somewhere in between. It uses microfluidics to track the two transcription factors but asks how their dynamics relate to growth.</p><p>One interesting finding, corroborating the authors' 2017 work, is that Msn2 and Dot6 do not show entirely coordinated activity. The authors identify upwards of 10 clusters of cells distinguished by different dynamic patterns of the two TFs. This finding raises the possibility that this kind of approach can find meaningful subpopulations of cells with different physiological properties.</p><p>However, the manuscript does not go far in developing understanding of how these subpopulations are generated. The authors describe Msn2 and Dot6 as both being controlled by both PKA and TOR. But that does not necessarily mean that Msn2 and Dot6 should always respond together -- one simple hypothesis is that the discordance that is seen is a result of differences in the relative contributions of these signaling pathways to Msn2 and Dot6 control. There are also counter-intuitive results that remain to be explained. In particular, the authors report that cluster 11, with below-average Dot6 response before and during stress showed slower growth. Because Dot6 represses growth-promoting genes, one would expect low Dot6 response to produce faster growth. In the end, the biggest predictor of post-stress growth rate was pre-stress growth rate, so the authors' conclusion that prior life history states are predictive (to some extent) of future ones is reasonable. But it remains to be seen why the correlation exists.</p><p>The results presented in the manuscript will certainly be of interest to those following this line of research, but the impact more generally is moderate because of the lack of deeper mechanistic insight into how this important signaling network generates heterogeneity in growth responses.</p><p>One recommendation to strengthen the presentation of the paper would be to include a figure (and/or movies) showing primary data (time-lapse images of fluorescent signal in cells in the microfluidics device), especially since this is not an off-the-shelf microfluidics platform.</p><p>Another recommendation is to flesh out more the comparisons to prior experimental work. For example, a reader new to this line of research would not immediately grasp that Li et al. 2018 followed colony growth for much longer time periods, did not use microfluidics, and used cells enriched for slow growth when examining Msn2 dynamics. These details can affect how a reader interprets the observation that Msn2 response does not correlate strongly with growth in this study. Also, the authors do not discuss any connection between growth heterogeneity and mitochondrial function, which featured heavily in the Fehrmann et al. 2013 and Li et al. 2018 papers that were cited, as well as in Dhar et al. (<italic>eLife</italic> 8:e38904, 2019) that was not cited.</p><p>[Editors’ note: further revisions were suggested prior to acceptance, as described below.]</p><p>Thank you for resubmitting your work entitled &quot;Modeling single-cell phenotypes links yeast stress acclimation to transcriptional repression and pre-stress cellular states&quot; for further consideration by <italic>eLife</italic>. Your revised article has been evaluated by Naama Barkai (Senior Editor) and a Reviewing Editor.</p><p>The manuscript has been improved but there are some remaining issues that need to be addressed, as outlined below:</p><p>I appreciate that the authors have put in a fair amount of work into the revision and I do believe the paper is strengthened. The authors have responded to my main concerns.</p><p>Regarding cell growth calculations, I do remain concerned. They do not do subpixel segmentation, and they only do 2D segmentation as I understand it. Furthermore, they do not quantify growth rate (which I would define as the mass accumulation per unit time). Instead, they take the relative change in the median size, and for much of the paper they then take the logarithm of this number. A lot of these assumptions seem reasonable but arbitrary and as added complications, yeast cells shrink dramatically in size upon osmotic stress and then gradually recover (so changes in cell size reflect both cell growth and osmotic changes) and budding yeast mainly grow at the bud, and the bud is frequently out-of-focus and not quantified.</p><p>Accordingly, the main output metric in the entire paper – cell growth rate – and the measured values are associated with very very large uncertainties and caveats. At a minimum, this need to be more explicitly mentioned and caveated in the main text.</p><p>Moreover, some of the analysis remains not totally convincing. For example, in Figure 5A there is a mostly random vertical scatter of points, and what seems like a fairly arbitrary straight line is drawn through it. The p-value may be small, but this does not look like a model that very well explains the data.</p><p>Overall, I appreciate the great work done by the authors to address the reviewer comments, but I do think both some technical and conceptual concerns remain. That said, it is a challenging question to tackle, and it is not clear a priori how much of the variation we should even expect Msn2 and Dot6 dynamics to explain.</p></body></sub-article><sub-article article-type="reply" id="sa2"><front-stub><article-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.82017.sa2</article-id><title-group><article-title>Author response</article-title></title-group></front-stub><body><p>[Editors’ note: the authors resubmitted a revised version of the paper for consideration.

First, we provide additional detail on how the growth rate was calculated. The reviewer raises an important point about the challenges in calculating cell volume; indeed, small error in estimating diameters leads to large error in volume, and for this reason we did not attempt to estimate volume. Instead, we collapsed the three z-stack images and tracked the pixel area, corresponding to colony size, over time. We note that growth rate is calculated by the change in <italic>relative size</italic>; the median pre-stressed colony size is 4,829 pixels (where pixel size is 0.1075 x 0.1075 m) and cells changed by a median of 30% area over the course of the experiment. We did not do subpixel analysis. It is true that some calculated growth rates are under-estimated (namely, cases where the bud emerges perpendicular to the plane of analysis). However, the correlations we observe cannot be explained by this subset of cells for which growth rate is under-estimated.</p><p>Second, we now include several new analyses validating our approach (Figure 1 – supplement 2). We performed a more thorough analysis on growth rate estimates using sliding windows as requested by the reviewer. The results reveal that the growth rates are well measured and robust. (i) The logged change in cell size is very linearly correlated with time in the majority of pre-stressed cells (median R<sup>2</sup> = 0.92, Figure 1 – supplement 2A). We estimated growth rates from subsets of timepoints using a sliding window as requested by the reviewer: the correlations between growth rates measured over all pre-stressed timepoints versus subsets of timepoints in a sliding temporal window is also very high for all windows (Figure 1 – supplement 2B). There is a wider distribution of linear fits post-stress (median R<sup>2</sup> = 0.73, Figure 1 – supplement 2C), consistent with the range of acclimation behaviors we investigate in the manuscript. Indeed, cells that recovered growth rate after stress showed an increase in logged colony size that was well estimated by a linear fit (i.e. high R<sup>2</sup>), whereas cells with a lower post-stress growth rate fit less well and were more influenced by measurement noise (Figure 1 – supplement 2E), as confirmed by manual inspection. Together, these data indicate that our measurements are robust to the particular time window we investigated and that the linear fit to estimate growth rate is very high for the vast majority of cells.</p><p>Finally, we performed a mock experiment in which cells were exposed to a simple rich-media switch in the absence of NaCl stress. The vast majority of cells did not show large changes in growth rate (median ln(growth-rate change) = -0.20), compared to cells that experience the NaCl shift (median ln(growth-rate change) = -0.85, Figure 1 – supplement 2F). Together, these new experiments show that our growth rate estimates are robust and trends discussed in the manuscript are specific to NaCl stress.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>For my second concern, I'd like the authors to test how robust their various results are to cell numbers. I suggest that they do subsampling, where they leave out 50% of their data/cells, repeat their analysis, and then iterate multiple times to assess if all of their conclusions are robust. For example, I am concerned about whether or not they have enough data to support 11 clusters. This type of subsampling approach should be informative, though I would like to see this approach applied to all of the major conclusions and analyses.</p></disp-quote><p>The revised manuscript addresses this concern in several ways. We did not intend to imply that there are precisely 11 meaningful clusters (in fact, we stated in the paper that a few of these patterns were only seen in one replicate and thus unlikely to be reproducible). We de-emphasized that there are 11 clusters in the revised manuscript. The important point here is that several of these clusters that are based entirely on transcription-factor dynamics predict pre-stress or post-stress growth rate, which were not used in the clustering. Indeed, we already showed in the manuscript that these correlations remain if we analyze cells from each replicate individually (<italic>i.e.</italic> subsample by replicate), as highlighted in the text.</p><p>Rather than perform additional subsampling analysis, we instead provide a better validation by adding three new replicate experiments. Although the new experiments (described more below) were done with a different strain and somewhat different microscopy settings, all of the relationships reported in the main text are recapitulated with the new data: We confirm that Dot6 peak height, but not Msn2 peak-height, is correlated with pre-stress growth rate (p = 1e-5) and post-stress growth rate (p = 0.002); modeling of post-stress growth rate is significantly influenced by Dot6 peak-height independent of its correlation with pre-stress growth rate (p = 0.04), and a multi-factorial model best explains post-stress growth rate compared to models with any single factor alone (p = 7e-6). We note that because the microscopy conditions were different, we did not attempt to merge data into a single analysis.</p><p>Finally, we show that the important clusters in Figure 4 are recapitulated in an independent mixed model clustering of the new dataset (Figure 4 – supplement 1 and Figure 5 – supplement 2). This analysis identified 6 clusters of &gt;3 cells, all of which can be related to clusters from the original dataset. More importantly, the same subpopulation patterns originally associated with pre- and post-stress growth rate differences have the same statistically significant associations in the new dataset.</p><p>These new analyses show without a doubt that the patterns and trends we reported in the original manuscript are all valid, robust, and reproducible.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Since both of these concerns can be assessed using either purely more computational analysis and/or just with the addition of a very simple experiment, hopefully they should not be onerous to address.</p><p>My conceptual concern is whether or not the present paper is a major conceptual advance. The notions that prior life history affects how cells deal with a stress response as well as the observation of substantial heterogeneity in single cell stress responses, are both well-known in the field and similar observations have been made in yeast and other organisms. So, the major novel contributions seem to be the relative important of Dot6 and Msn2 (Dot6 is more predictive than Msn2, which at least I did not know), and a quantification of how much one can predict from Dot6 and Msn2. This is certainly a nice contribution, and the study seems to be generally performed in a thoughtful manner, but it is perhaps a modest conceptual advance given what is already known.</p></disp-quote><p>We appreciate the concern of the reviewer and decided to add several new experiments that provide direct testing of the hypotheses put forward in the original submission. This makes more a much more satisfying study that presents important new insights into stress defense and recovery.</p><p>As this reviewer and the others point out, the connection between Dot6 and post-stress growth recovery seems counterintuitive, since a larger Dot6 stress response is predicted to produce stronger repression of growth-promoting genes. However, this result is consistent with our working model:</p><p>We previously showed that transcriptional repression by Dot6 (and its paralog Tod6) is required to redirect translational capacity away from ribosome biogenesis (RiBi) mRNAs and toward stress induced transcripts. Mutant cells lacking <italic>DOT6</italic> and <italic>TOD6</italic> fail to repress RiBi gene targets; the overabundant transcripts remain associated with ribosomes at the expense of stress-induced transcripts including Msn2-regulated <italic>CTT1</italic>. As a consequence, cells lacking <italic>DOT6</italic> and <italic>TOD6</italic> show delayed production of Ctt1 protein despite making more <italic>CTT1</italic> transcript (Ho <italic>et al.</italic> Current Biology, 2018).</p><p>The current manuscript expands on this model to explore why we now observe that a stronger Dot6 activation response in wild-type cells is associated with faster post-stress growth recovery. First, we show that a <italic>dot6∆tod6∆</italic> mutant in our culture media grows indistinguishably from wild type before stress but shows reduced growth recovery after NaCl treatment (new Figure 7A). Thus, Dot6 provides a protective response during stress and is required for normal stress acclimation.</p><p>An unresolved question is if differences in Dot6 activation in a <italic>wild-type</italic> cells affects Ctt1 production. We tested this here by generating a strain with three fluorescent proteins: Dot6-GFP, Msn2mCherry, and Ctt1-iRFP. This strain allows us to track growth rate, transcription factor localization dynamics, and Ctt1 production.</p><p>In fact, we find that wild-type cells with a larger Dot6 translocation peak after NaCl show higher levels and faster change of Ctt1 after NaCl treatment – this is separable from the influence of inducer Msn2: linear modeling shows that both factors contribute to Ctt1 production timing, however the contribution of Dot6 is much more significant (Msn2 activation peak is only marginally significant, p = 0.053 and explains much less of the variance in Ctt1 production timing). This is not due to association of Dot6 and pre-stress growth rate, since differences in pre-stress growth show no correlation with Ctt1production time (p = 0.21)</p><p>This is an exciting result that significantly expands our past model and our understanding of how and why cells mount a systemic response. We very much hope these extensive revisions have addressed the reviewer’s points. We believe that we have shown that our results and methods are robust, reproducible, and influential given the new insights the revised manuscript presents.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Reviewer #2 (Recommendations for the authors):</p><p>In this manuscript, Bergen et al. combined microfluidics and time-lapse imaging to monitor single-cell phenotypes in response to acute osmotic stress.

This is evident in the mixed linear modeling, where a model that incorporates both factors explains significantly more of the variance than either single factor model alone.</p><p>To further ensure that these factors are not simply co-variates of the same underlying feature, we added two new analyses. First, we added a principal component (PC) regression analysis. We first applied PC analysis to the four factors that were significant in the mixed linear modeling (Figure 6B). We then performed linear modeling using the PC variables and subsequently deconvoluted each PC into biological features that contribute to them. We found that 21% of the variance in post-stress growth rate is explained by PC1 + PC3, which capture the intertwined contributions of pre-stress growth rate, pre-stress Dot6 AUC, and acute-stress Dot6 peak height. It is true that these features may reflect one aspect of the cellular state, such as biosynthetic capacity (a point we present in the revised Discussion). However, an additional 14% of the variance is explained by PC4, which does not relate to pre-stress growth rate and is predominated by Dot6 behavior. Thus, Dot6 acute-stress peak height has separable explanatory power.</p><p>As an additional alternate approach, we added another analysis in Figure 6 – supplement 2: we analyzed a subset of cells that were insignificantly different from one another in pre-stress growth rate. Over this subset, there is no correlation between pre-stress and post-stress growth rate – however, there remains a significant correlation between Dot6 acute-stress peak height and post stress growth rate explaining 12% of the variance (p = 9.7e-5). Thus, without a doubt, there is a significant correlation between Dot6 behavior and the ability to recover from stress. As we report in the new manuscript, Dot6 indeed provides a protective response during stress but not before (new Figure 7) and is correlated with faster production of Msn2 target Ctt1, independent of the explanatory power of Msn2. As we expound on in the Results and Discussion, this is all consistent with and significantly expands past work from our lab showing that transient repression of growth-promoting genes is important to temporarily redirect translational capacity to induced transcripts during acclimation.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Reviewer #3 (Recommendations for the authors):</p><p>Bergen et al. study how the dynamic subcellular localizations of two stress-responsive transcription factors (Dot6 and Msn2) relate to variability in the growth of yeast cells before, during and after high-salt stress.</p><p>Previous studies (e.g., by the O'Shea lab) used microfluidics to look at subcellular dynamics of Msn2 and other transcription factors from a more mechanistic point of view. Other studies (e.g., Li et al. 2018 cited in the manuscript) used higher-throughput time-lapse imaging to look at population heterogeneity in growth, gene expression and stress tolerance. The present study is appealing because it sits somewhere in between. It uses microfluidics to track the two transcription factors but asks how their dynamics relate to growth.</p><p>One interesting finding, corroborating the authors' 2017 work, is that Msn2 and Dot6 do not show entirely coordinated activity. The authors identify upwards of 10 clusters of cells distinguished by different dynamic patterns of the two TFs. This finding raises the possibility that this kind of approach can find meaningful subpopulations of cells with different physiological properties.</p><p>However, the manuscript does not go far in developing understanding of how these subpopulations are generated. The authors describe Msn2 and Dot6 as both being controlled by both PKA and TOR. But that does not necessarily mean that Msn2 and Dot6 should always respond together -- one simple hypothesis is that the discordance that is seen is a result of differences in the relative contributions of these signaling pathways to Msn2 and Dot6 control. There are also counter-intuitive results that remain to be explained. In particular, the authors report that cluster 11, with below-average Dot6 response before and during stress showed slower growth. Because Dot6 represses growth-promoting genes, one would expect low Dot6 response to produce faster growth. In the end, the biggest predictor of post-stress growth rate was pre-stress growth rate, so the authors' conclusion that prior life history states are predictive (to some extent) of future ones is reasonable. But it remains to be seen why the correlation exists.</p><p>The results presented in the manuscript will certainly be of interest to those following this line of research, but the impact more generally is moderate because of the lack of deeper mechanistic insight into how this important signaling network generates heterogeneity in growth responses.</p></disp-quote><p>We hope that the new experiments added to the manuscript completely address these points. Our new experiments, outlined in detail above, show that: (1) Dot6 provides a protective response during stress, since cells lacking <italic>DOT6</italic> and its paralog <italic>TOD6</italic> show wild-type growth before stress but slower growth acclimation after stress (new Figure 7A) – this is exactly consistent with results presented here, in which wild-type cells with a weaker Dot6 response show a slower growth acclimation. (2) Our past work predicts that transient Dot6-dependent transcriptional repression helps to temporarily redirect translational capacity to stress-induced transcripts. Indeed, cells lacking <italic>DOT6</italic> and <italic>TOD6</italic> show delays in producing Msn2-dependent target Ctt1. We now show here that wild-type cells with a larger Dot6 acute-stress response show statistically significantly faster Ctt1 production, separable from the contribution of Msn2 (new Figure 7). Indeed, a mixed linear model shows that the Dot6 response is the main contributor to Ctt1 production time. (3) Finally, our new analyses show that all of the patterns reported in the original manuscript are reproduced in our new datasets. We integrate these results into a new section in the Discussion that discusses the different pre-stress cellular states that these patterns may reflect.</p><p>The revised manuscripts adds important new insights that are likely to be of broad interest. With the new experiments, insights, and tested hypotheses we believe that this work will make an excellent contribution to <italic>eLife</italic>.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>One recommendation to strengthen the presentation of the paper would be to include a figure (and/or movies) showing primary data (time-lapse images of fluorescent signal in cells in the microfluidics device), especially since this is not an off-the-shelf microfluidics platform.</p></disp-quote><p>We added Figure 1 – supplement 1 that shows an example cell tracked over time in the bright field, GPF, and mCherry channels.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Another recommendation is to flesh out more the comparisons to prior experimental work. For example, a reader new to this line of research would not immediately grasp that Li et al. 2018 followed colony growth for much longer time periods, did not use microfluidics, and used cells enriched for slow growth when examining Msn2 dynamics. These details can affect how a reader interprets the observation that Msn2 response does not correlate strongly with growth in this study. Also, the authors do not discuss any connection between growth heterogeneity and mitochondrial function, which featured heavily in the Fehrmann et al. 2013 and Li et al. 2018 papers that were cited, as well as in Dhar et al. (eLife 8:e38904, 2019) that was not cited.</p></disp-quote><p>We added several statements throughout the paper to clarify that Li et al. followed much longer time frames and that the lack of connection between stress acclimation and Msn2 response pertains to the conditions studied here. The revised Discussion provides an expanded discussion of other features that could influence the stress response, including a more direct mention of metabolic differences and mitochondrial function. We added the references suggested by the reviewer.</p><p>[Editors’ note: what follows is the authors’ response to the second round of review.]</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>The manuscript has been improved but there are some remaining issues that need to be addressed, as outlined below:</p><p>I appreciate that the authors have put in a fair amount of work into the revision and I do believe the paper is strengthened. The authors have responded to my main concerns.</p></disp-quote><p>We also feel that the manuscript has been significantly improved thanks to the review process, and we thank the editor and this reviewer for the positive feedback on our revisions.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Regarding cell growth calculations, I do remain concerned. They do not do subpixel segmentation, and they only do 2D segmentation as I understand it. Furthermore, they do not quantify growth rate (which I would define as the mass accumulation per unit time). Instead, they take the relative change in the median size, and for much of the paper they then take the logarithm of this number. A lot of these assumptions seem reasonable but arbitrary and as added complications, yeast cells shrink dramatically in size upon osmotic stress and then gradually recover (so changes in cell size reflect both cell growth and osmotic changes) and budding yeast mainly grow at the bud, and the bud is frequently out-of-focus and not quantified.</p></disp-quote><p>The reviewer raises several points that we will address in turn. In choosing our image segmentation technique we chose to stay close to accepted methodologies in the literature (Versari, <italic>et al.</italic> 2017; Li, <italic>et al.</italic> 2018; http://yeast-image-toolkit.biosim.eu/), which do not use subpixel segmentation (see for example Bagamery, <italic>et al.</italic> 2020; Plavskim, <italic>et al.</italic> 2021; Li, <italic>et al.</italic> 2018; Levy, <italic>et al.</italic> 2012). Importantly, subpixel segmentation would add little to the accuracy of our approach: the median prestressed yeast colony size is ~4,900 pixels – as a back-of-the-envelope calculation assuming a perfect circle, this corresponds to a radius of 39.5. Extending the radius by one pixel and again assuming a simple circle for calculation, that would change the area by 5%. Thus, using subpixel segmentation would not hugely change our area estimates. The minimal error in calculating area combined with our adherence to accepted image segmentation techniques makes us confident in our analysis choices, despite some necessary assumptions with this method.</p><p>In terms of growth rate calculations: as a point of clarification, we did not use any median to calculate growth rates. We used the change in natural log of colony area in collapsed images from z-stack measurements. This is in keeping with prevailing approaches in yeast microscopy studies (e.g. Bagamery, <italic>et al.</italic> 2020; Levy, <italic>et al.</italic> 2012), which use maximum projection of colony z-stacks to define the colony area and take the linear fit as growth rate. There is a trade-off between z-resolution (<italic>i.e.</italic> number of z-stacks) and yeast stress induced by repeated light exposure, which limits the number of z-stacks we can take. Short of a different microscopy system, what we have done extends to the limits of our system, which we believe is accurate enough to reveal important new information, as expanded on below.</p><p>It is true that our approach will under-estimate growth rates for cells in which the bud emerges perpendicular to the slide plane; however, this noise is almost certainly leading to under-estimates of the relationship between transcription factor activation (which is well measured in all planes) to growth rate. Furthermore, many cells are well measured in our study: 57% of cells were scored as having a bud at the outset of the experiment (indicated as S, G2, or M phase, available in the data source file), and the range of pre- and post-stress growth rates as we measured them are very similar for cells scored in these different phases. Thus, while there is some noise due to budding out of field of focus, our measurements are accurate for most cells. Nonetheless, we have explicitly revised the manuscript to bring this caveat to the reader’s attention as detailed below.</p><p>The reviewer also raises concern about changes in cell volume after NaCl stress, which they argue could confound post-stress growth rate measurements. We point out that volume changes recover to pre-stress levels by 30-40 minutes (here, and also Babazadeh <italic>et al.</italic> 2013; Miermont <italic>et al.</italic> 2013), and we calculated post-stress growth rates from timepoints spanning 42 – 96 minutes after NaCl exposure in our study. Thus, we do not expect that recovery of cell volume separate from growth can explain changes in colony area at these later time points.</p><p>As an important conclusion to our arguments, we highlight that one of the major predictions made from our microfluidics and growth rate measurements – that Dot6 plays a positive role in acclimation to NaCl – is born out in bulk culture analysis that uses different methods to measure culture growth dynamics. Furthermore, the results agree with independent correlations between Dot6 activity and Ctt1 production, whose measurement is not affected by the concerns of the reviewer. Thus, the trends we report are robust and uncovering new information about stress responses, despite some necessary limitations.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Accordingly, the main output metric in the entire paper – cell growth rate – and the measured values are associated with very very large uncertainties and caveats. At a minimum, this need to be more explicitly mentioned and caveated in the main text.</p></disp-quote><p>As detailed in above, we feel that the noise associated with our area and growth rate measurements is reasonable and in keeping with established methodology in the field. However, we agree with the reviewer that necessary assumptions and potential caveats should be highlighted in the text. We made several changes to the manuscript to present this:</p><p>On Page 7, first paragraph of the Results: “We used the relative change in colony area over time, collapsed from multiple z-stack images per time point, as a proxy for growth rate. One limitation is that growth by this estimation will be under-estimated for cells that bud perpendicular to the slide plane, introducing noise into the growth rate measurements for some cells.”</p><p>On Page 13/14 of the Results: “We note that noise in the growth-rate measurements is likely diminishing the true fit, such that the explanatory power reported here is actually an under-estimate.”</p><p>Page 20 of the Discussion: “It will be interesting to see as technology develops for improved growth rate measurements if this fit improves further.”</p><p>On Page 24/25 of the Methods: “We note that our proxy for post-stress growth rate, taken as an indication of how well cells acclimate to salt stress, could also be influenced by differences in volume recovery for some cells, which may also be a feature of successful acclimation.”</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Moreover, some of the analysis remains not totally convincing. For example, in Figure 5A there is a mostly random vertical scatter of points, and what seems like a fairly arbitrary straight line is drawn through it. The p-value may be small, but this does not look like a model that very well explains the data.</p></disp-quote><p>Thank you to this reviewer for making our point here, which is that the correlation shown in Figure 5A (between pre- and post-stress growth rates) <italic>is very low</italic>. A main point of the paper is that the correlation <italic>improves significantly</italic> when we incorporate other independent parameters (Figure 6B) in the fit – the point here is that the fit significantly improves from Figure 5A to Figure 6C where we explain 35% of the variance in growth rate as we measured it. As discussed above, this is likely an under-estimate due to the noise in measuring growth rate for a subset of cells, but the trends are real.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Overall, I appreciate the great work done by the authors to address the reviewer comments, but I do think both some technical and conceptual concerns remain. That said, it is a challenging question to tackle, and it is not clear a priori how much of the variation we should even expect Msn2 and Dot6 dynamics to explain.</p></disp-quote><p>We agree that this is a challenging problem to study but argue that our approach provides important and unexpected insights into stress biology, even if our explanatory power is under-estimated. We had already added a paragraph to the revised manuscript that discusses the numerous factors that act together to influence stress acclimation, citing other possible features not studied here. However, the relationships between stress acclimatation and Msn2 and Dot6 behavior that we report were not expected at the outset, as commented on by all three of the original reviewers, and the revised manuscript presents new models to explain these unexpected results and the role of transcriptional repression in salt acclimation. This work was just presented to world leaders in the field at the International Symposium on Fungal Stress and it was hugely well received. We believe the revised manuscript will also be very well received and make a strong contribution at <italic>eLife.</italic></p></body></sub-article></article>
