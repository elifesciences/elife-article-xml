a proposed target for future anti-arrhythmic drugs. We previously showed that polyunsaturated fatty acids (PUFAs) activate K<sub>V</sub>7.1 via an electrostatic mechanism. The activating effect was abolished when K<sub>V</sub>7.1 was co-expressed with KCNE1, as KCNE1 renders PUFAs ineffective by promoting PUFA protonation. PUFA protonation reduces the potential of PUFAs as anti-arrhythmic compounds. It is unknown how KCNE1 promotes PUFA protonation. Here, we found that neutralization of negatively charged residues in the S5-P-helix loop of K<sub>V</sub>7.1 restored PUFA effects on K<sub>V</sub>7.1 co-expressed with KCNE1 in <italic>Xenopus</italic> oocytes. We propose that KCNE1 moves the S5-P-helix loop of K<sub>V</sub>7.1 towards the PUFA-binding site, which indirectly causes PUFA protonation, thereby reducing the effect of PUFAs on K<sub>V</sub>7.1. This mechanistic understanding of how KCNE1 alters K<sub>V</sub>7.1 pharmacology is essential for development of drugs targeting the I<sub>Ks</sub> channel.</p></abstract><abstract abstract-type="executive-summary"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.37257.002</object-id><title>eLife digest</title><p>The muscle cells in the heart must contract and relax in a coordinated way for the heart to pump blood efficiently around the body. Different ions flow in and out of these cells, which are known as cardiomyocytes, to control when they contract and relax. The ions enter and leave by passing through channel proteins in each cell’s membrane. People with mutations in the genes that encode these channel proteins are often prone to irregular heartbeats and may suddenly die because their heart stops pumping blood effectively.</p><p>Drugs that can restore the function of mutated ion channels are considered an attractive new avenue for treating the irregular heartbeats and preventing the sudden deaths. Yet a poor understanding of how the other proteins that interact with these channels may reduce the effect of these drugs has hampered their development. In 2015, researchers showed that some polyunsaturated fatty acids could help restore a normal heartbeat via an effect on the IKs channel, one of the ion channels that regulate the electric activity in cardiomyocytes. But, a protein called KCNE1 – which forms part of the IKs channel – reduced the effect of these fatty molecules via an unknown mechanism.</p><p>Now, Larsson et al. – who are three of the researchers involved in the 2015 study – report how KCNE1 reduces the effect of polyunsaturated fatty acids on the IKs channel. The experiments involved mutated human IKs channels produced in the egg cells of African clawed frogs – a popular model system for a wide variety of biological studies. Larsson et al. found that flexible loop-like part of the IKs channel has an overall negative charge that attracts positively charged hydrogen ions to the polyunsaturated fatty acid. This masks the electrical change of the fatty acid so that it no longer has any effect on the IKs channel. Yet, this phenomenon only occurs when KCNE1 is present, suggesting that KCNE1 moves specific parts of the loop close to the polyunsaturated fatty acid.</p><p>Several ion channels in cardiomyocytes are made from multiple subunits. Understanding how some of these subunits alter the effect of drugs will help scientists to develop drugs that efficiently act on these ion channels. Such drugs may offer new treatments for irregular heartbeats and prevent the sudden deaths. But as with all new drugs, extensive testing and clinical trials will be needed before anything reaches the clinic.</p></abstract><kwd-group kwd-group-type="author-keywords"><kwd>KCNQ1</kwd><kwd>protonation</kwd><kwd>two-electrode voltage clamp</kwd><kwd>IKs</kwd></kwd-group><kwd-group kwd-group-type="research-organism"><title>Research organism</title><kwd><italic>Xenopus</italic></kwd></kwd-group><funding-group><award-group id="fund1"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000002</institution-id><institution>National Institutes of Health</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>R01GM109762</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Larsson</surname><given-names>H Peter</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund2"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000002</institution-id><institution>National Institutes of Health</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>R01HL131461</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Larsson</surname><given-names>H Peter</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund3"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100003748</institution-id><institution>Svenska Sällskapet för Medicinsk Forskning</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Liin</surname><given-names>Sara I</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund4"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100004359</institution-id><institution>Vetenskapsrådet</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Liin</surname><given-names>Sara I</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund5"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution>Linköping University</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Liin</surname><given-names>Sara I</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund6"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution>County Council of Östergötland</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Liin</surname><given-names>Sara I</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund7"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100001523</institution-id><institution>Lion Foundation</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Liin</surname><given-names>Sara I</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><funding-statement>The funders had no role in study design, data collection and interpretation, or the decision to submit the work for publication.</funding-statement></funding-group><custom-meta-group><custom-meta specific-use="meta-only"><meta-name>Author impact statement</meta-name><meta-value>An auxiliary subunit alters the effect of a family of small-molecule openers on a voltage-gated potassium channel by inducing structural re-arrangements that promote protonation of the drug molecule.</meta-value></custom-meta></custom-meta-group></article-meta></front><body><sec id="s1" sec-type="intro"><title>Introduction</title><p>The voltage-gated potassium channel K<sub>V</sub>7.1 and the auxiliary subunit KCNE1 together form the slowly activating and voltage-gated I<sub>Ks</sub> potassium channel, an important channel for cardiomyocyte repolarization (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Nerbonne and Kass, 2005</xref>). More than 300 mutations in the genes encoding for K<sub>V</sub>7.1 and KCNE1 have been found in patients with cardiac arrhythmias (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Hedley et al., 2009</xref>). Mutations that reduce I<sub>Ks</sub> currents delay repolarization of the ventricular cardiac action potential and prolong the QT interval in the electrocardiogram, referred to as Long QT syndrome (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Hedley et al., 2009</xref>). Long QT syndrome is a known risk factor for ventricular fibrillation and sudden cardiac death (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Nerbonne and Kass, 2005</xref>). Up to 30% of patients with inherited Long QT syndrome are not protected against severe cardiac events using current anti-arrhythmic treatments (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Goldenberg et al., 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Priori et al., 2004</xref>). Therefore, several studies have promoted the need for novel pharmacological drugs that increase or even restore the function of mutated potassium channels critical for cardiomyocyte repolarization; as these drugs could potentially be used to treat Long QT syndrome in carriers with loss-of-function potassium channel mutations (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Anderson et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Perry et al., 2016</xref>).</p><p>Several promising compounds have been found to activate the K<sub>V</sub>7.1 channel (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Busch et al., 1994</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Gao et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Mattmann et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Salata et al., 1998</xref>). Unfortunately, the effects of several K<sub>V</sub>7.1 channel activators are dramatically impaired by KCNE1 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Busch et al., 1997</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Gao et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Salata et al., 1998</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">Yu et al., 2013</xref>). For example, we have previously described that the activating effect of polyunsaturated fatty acids (PUFAs) on the human K<sub>V</sub>7.1 channel, expressed in <italic>Xenopus</italic> oocytes, is impaired by KCNE1 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Liin et al., 2015b</xref>). Because K<sub>V</sub>7.1 is co-assembled with KCNE1 in the native I<sub>Ks</sub> channel complex in the heart (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Barhanin et al., 1996</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Sanguinetti et al., 1996</xref>), K<sub>V</sub>7.1 channel activators must affect the K<sub>V</sub>7.1+KCNE1 complex (referred to as K<sub>V</sub>7.1+E1) to prevent cardiac arrhythmias, such as in Long QT syndrome. Although KCNE1 is important for the pharmacology of the I<sub>Ks</sub> channel, little is known about the molecular mechanisms underlying how KCNE1 changes the sensitivity of K<sub>V</sub>7.1 to various compounds. This lack of mechanistic understanding limits the clinical utility and further rational design of several K<sub>V</sub>7.1 channel activators that potentially could be used to improve treatment of patients with conditions due to compromised K<sub>V</sub>7.1+E1 channels.</p><p>K<sub>V</sub>7.1, the alpha subunit of the I<sub>Ks</sub> channel, is a potassium channel protein composed of six membrane-spanning segments, S1-S6: Helices S1 to S4 form the peripheral voltage-sensing domains and helices S5 and S6 form the central pore domain (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1A–B</xref>) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Liin et al., 2015a</xref>). KCNE1, a single-transmembrane protein, is proposed to interact with K<sub>V</sub>7.1 in the lipid-filled space between two voltage-sensing domains (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1B</xref>) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Chung et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Nakajo and Kubo, 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Xu et al., 2013</xref>). We have previously proposed that PUFAs incorporate into the outer leaflet of the cell membrane in the same lipid-filled space as KCNE1, but they incorporate closer than KCNE1 does to the transmembrane segments S3 and S4 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1B</xref>) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Liin et al., 2015b</xref>). In this position close to S4, negatively charged PUFAs, such as docosahexaenoic acid (DHA), facilitate K<sub>V</sub>7.1 channel opening by electrostatically promoting the outward movement of the positively charged S4 helix (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1C</xref>) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Liin et al., 2015b</xref>). As the DHA is negatively charged, DHA shifts the voltage dependence of K<sub>V</sub>7.1 channel opening toward more negative voltages (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1C</xref>) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Liin et al., 2015b</xref>).</p><fig id="fig1" position="float"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.37257.003</object-id><label>Figure 1.</label><caption><title>Concept of DHA-induced shift in K<sub>V</sub>7.1 channel voltage dependence.</title><p>(<bold>A</bold>) Schematic side view of one subunit of KCNE1 and K<sub>V</sub>7.1.

In addition, we proposed that this reduced effect is the result of KCNE1 decreasing the local pH at the DHA-binding site, inducing protonation of the DHA carboxyl head at pH 7.4 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1D</xref>) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Liin et al., 2015b</xref>). Therefore, DHA becomes uncharged and ineffective at physiological pH. As a consequence, PUFA analogues with a lower pKa of the head group, which prevents protonation at physiological pH, was able to activate K<sub>V</sub>7.1+E1 at physiological pH (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Liin et al., 2016</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">2015b</xref>). Moreover, we showed that the inhibiting effect of the positively charged PUFA analogue arachidonoyl amine (AA+) was potentiated by KCNE1, as if the decreased local pH at the PUFA-binding site further protonated the amine head of AA+ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Liin et al., 2015b</xref>). This improved protonation improves the electrostatic repulsion on the voltage sensor induced by AA+ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Liin et al., 2015b</xref>). However, it remains unclear how KCNE1 decreases the local pH at the PUFA-binding site. A mechanistic understanding of how KCNE1 tunes the pharmacology of the I<sub>Ks</sub> channel is critical for our ability to predict which PUFAs modulate the I<sub>Ks</sub> channel, knowledge that will guide the development of synthetic PUFA analogues that pharmacologically target the K<sub>V</sub>7.1+E1 channel. In this work, we propose a molecular mechanism that explains the KCNE1-induced protonation of PUFA.</p><p>To identify structural motifs in the K<sub>V</sub>7.1+E1 channel that are responsible for PUFA protonation, we took advantage of the distinct pH dependence of the DHA effect on K<sub>V</sub>7.1 and K<sub>V</sub>7.1+E1. We previously described that the ability of DHA to shift the voltage dependence of K<sub>V</sub>7.1 channel opening increases as pH increases, most likely due to deprotonation of DHA at higher pH (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1E</xref>, dashed line) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Liin et al., 2015b</xref>). We also described that the pH dependence of the DHA effect on K<sub>V</sub>7.1+E1 is shifted by about 1 pH unit compared to K<sub>V</sub>7.1, making DHA completely protonated and ineffective on K<sub>V</sub>7.1+E1 at physiological pH (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1E</xref>, compare dashed and solid lines) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Liin et al., 2015b</xref>). In this work, we systematically mutated motifs in K<sub>V</sub>7.1 and KCNE1 that could potentially cause KCNE1-induced protonation of DHA. We then compared the pH dependence of the DHA effect for each K<sub>V</sub>7.1+E1 channel mutant to that of wild-type (WT) K<sub>V</sub>7.1 with and without KCNE1 co-expressed. Our findings suggest that negatively charged amino acids in the S5-P-helix loop of K<sub>V</sub>7.1 cause DHA protonation, but only when DHA is bound to the K<sub>V</sub>7.1+E1 channel. We propose a model in which KCNE1 indirectly modulates the pharmacology of K<sub>V</sub>7.1 by inducing structural re-arrangements of the extracellular S5-P-helix loop of K<sub>V</sub>7.1, moving acidic residues in this loop close to the DHA molecule.</p></sec><sec id="s2" sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><sec id="s2-1"><title>Removal of charged amino acids in KCNE1 did not affect the pH dependence of the DHA effect</title><p>First, we tested the impact that charged amino acids in the extracellular N terminus of KCNE1 have on the pH dependence of the DHA effect on K<sub>V</sub>7.1.

Altogether, these data suggest that negatively charged residues in the S5-P-helix loop (especially E290) promote the protonation of DHA in K<sub>V</sub>7.1+E1. This protonation could be due to the negative charges in the S5-P-helix loop attracting hydrogen ions to the DHA-binding site. Because DHA protonation is promoted by KCNE1, a requisite for this hypothesis is that these negatively charged residues in the S5-P-helix loop are located close to the binding site for DHA when KCNE1 is present, but not when KCNE1 is absent.

Our results show that negatively charged residues in the loop connecting S5 to the pore helix, but not charged residues in the extracellular part of KCNE1, are important for KCNE1-induced DHA protonation. Neutralization of residue E290 at the top of the turret in the S5-P-helix loop had the largest impact on DHA protonation. Neutralization of E290 fully restored K<sub>V</sub>7.1-like pharmacological sensitivity of K<sub>V</sub>7.1+KCNE1 to DHA.

This hypothesis fits with the location of each tested amino acid and the size of the effect of each tested amino acid when neutralized: E290, the residue with the largest effect, is located in the middle of the long S5-P-helix loop and may easily reach over to the putative DHA binding site, whereas D301, the residue with the least effect, is in the P-helix, located far from the putative DHA-binding site (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5D</xref>).</p><fig id="fig5" position="float"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.37257.009</object-id><label>Figure 5.</label><caption><title>Proposed model of how KCNE1 induces protonation of PUFAs.</title><p>(<bold>A</bold>) PUFA (black) binds to K<sub>V</sub>7.1 in the lipid-filled space between two voltage-sensing domains (grey).

Decreased local pH causes PUFA protonation, which renders the PUFA uncharged and ineffective.

The charge distribution in the S5-P-helix loop will then determine to what extent protonatable compounds, such as PUFAs, are negatively charged and thereby able to electrostatically interact with the voltage sensor S4 (schematically illustrated in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5B–C</xref>).

KCNE1 has a major impact, either positive or negative, on the effect of some of these activators. For example, ML277, ZnPy, and R-L3 activate K<sub>V</sub>7.1, but the effect is reduced by KCNE1 co-expression (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Gao et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Salata et al., 1998</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">Yu et al., 2013</xref>). The proposed mechanism for the reduced sensitivity in K<sub>V</sub>7.1+E1 channels to these compounds is that KCNE1 and the compound compete for the same overall binding site (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Gao et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Seebohm et al., 2003</xref>) or that KCNE1 blocks the access to the compound binding site (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Xu et al., 2015</xref>). In contrast, mefenamic acid and DIDS (4,4´-diisothiocyanatostilbene-2,2´-disulfonic acid) have effects on K<sub>V</sub>7.1 expressed alone smaller than on K<sub>V</sub>7.1 co-expressed with KCNE1 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Busch et al., 1997</xref>). For DIDS and mefenamic acid, amino acids at the top of the KCNE1 transmembrane segment (KCNE1 amino acid 39–43) are important for the effect, but there is no clear mechanism for how KCNE1 increases the effect of mefenamic acid and DIDS (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Abitbol et al., 1999</xref>). Altogether, it is clear that KCNE1 can impair or promote the effect of K<sub>V</sub>7.1 channel activators through diverse mechanisms. Our novel model explains how KCNE1 impairs the effect of negatively charged PUFAs on K<sub>V</sub>7.1 by indirectly promoting PUFA protonation.</p><p>A detailed mechanistic understanding of how KCNE1 impairs the sensitivity of K<sub>V</sub>7.1 to activators will enable rational drug design of compounds that circumvent KCNE1-induced impairment. For example, charged PUFA analogues and related compounds may be chemically optimized to preserve their charge or designed to bind to a slightly different site to evade protonation promoted by KCNE1. A mechanistic framework for the design of I<sub>Ks</sub> channel activators may open up new avenues for treating cardiac arrhythmias, such as Long QT syndrome.</p></sec><sec id="s4" sec-type="materials|methods"><title>Materials and methods</title><table-wrap id="keyresource" position="anchor"><label>Key resources table</label><table frame="hsides" rules="groups"><thead><tr><th valign="top">Resource</th><th valign="top">Designation</th><th valign="top">Source</th><th valign="top">Identifiers</th><th valign="top">Additional information</th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td valign="top">Gene <break/>(<italic>H. sapiens</italic>)</td><td valign="top">KCNQ1</td><td valign="top">NA</td><td valign="top">GenBank Acc.No. <break/>NM_000218</td><td valign="top"/></tr><tr><td valign="top">Gene <break/>(<italic>H. sapiens</italic>)</td><td valign="top">KCNE1</td><td valign="top">NA</td><td valign="top">GenBank Acc.No. <break/>NM_000219</td><td valign="top"/></tr><tr><td valign="top">Chemical compound, <break/>drug</td><td valign="top">Docosahexaenoic acid (DHA)</td><td valign="top">Sigma</td><td valign="top">Cat#: D2534</td><td valign="top"/></tr><tr><td valign="top">Chemical compound, <break/>drug</td><td valign="top">Sodium [2-sulfonatoethyl] <break/>methanethiosulfonate (MTSES-)</td><td valign="top">Toronto Research <break/>Chemicals</td><td valign="top">Cat#: S672000</td><td valign="top"/></tr></tbody></table></table-wrap><sec id="s4-1"><title>Molecular biology</title><p>K<sub>V</sub>7.1 (GenBank Acc.No. NM_000218) in expression plasmid pXOOM and KCNE1 (NM_000219) in pGEM have been previously described (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Jespersen et al., 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Schmitt et al., 2007</xref>).

Your article has been reviewed by three peer reviewers, including László Csanády as the Reviewing Editor and Reviewer #1, and the evaluation has been overseen by Richard Aldrich as the Senior Editor.</p><p>The reviewers have discussed the reviews with one another and the Reviewing Editor has drafted this decision to help you prepare a revised submission.</p><p>Summary:</p><p>This study builds on previous work by the authors that demonstrated activation (i.e., a leftward shift in the voltage-activation curve) of K<sub>v</sub>7.1 channels by polyunsaturated fatty acids (PUFAs). That effect, shown to reflect an electrostatic interaction between the negatively charged PUFA headgroups and the gating charge arginines which promote outward movement of the voltage sensor, was diminished by co-expression of KCNE1 (E1). Furthermore, E1 suppressed the PUFA effect on K<sub>v</sub>7.1 by promoting protonation of the PUFA headgroups, likely by lowering local pH. Correspondingly, N-arachidonoyl taurine, a PUFA analog with a permanent negative charge, was efficacious in activating the native K<sub>v</sub>7.1/KCNE1 complex, and restored normal action potential duration in animal models of arrhythmia. PUFAs are of great interest in pharmaceutical development because their chemistries are highly manipulatable and they bind to less conserved regions of ion channels, suggesting the potential for channel-specific modulation and fewer off-target effects. In the future variants of such compounds might be useful as therapeutic agents and understanding the basis for PUFA activation will be important.</p><p>The present study addresses the mechanism of the E1-induced reduction in local pH around the PUFA headgroups. Using site-directed mutagenesis the authors demonstrate that charged extracellular residues of E1 are not involved in the process. In contrast, neutralization of negatively charged side chains in the K<sub>v</sub>7.1 turret loop abolish the effect of co-expressed E1 on the apparent pKa of PUFAs, whereas PUFA-stimulation itself of K<sub>v</sub>7.1 remains unaltered. The authors suggest that the presence of E1 alters the conformation of the turret loop in a way that makes its charged residues move closer to the PUFA binding site, allowing them to reduce local pH by attracting protons. This is an interesting study which provides a hint for how the presence of the KCNE1 subunit can alter the pharmacology of the cardiac IKs current, a question with obvious physiological relevance.</p><p>Essential revisions:</p><p>All three of us share a single concern which we request the authors address. We are concerned about the assumption that substituting a cysteine for a charged residue is the same as removing the charged side chain. One concern is the likely (but potentially variable) oxidizing environment of the different extracellular surface positions targeted, which could promote intersubunit disulfide bond formation in the mutants, thereby changing turret conformation and/or mobility rather than simply reducing surface charge. (E.g., in the homology model shown in Figure 5 the E290 side chains seem quite close to each other. Are the effects of the mutations also seen in the presence of extracellular DTT?) A second concern is the fact that the assay involves changes in pH, which could change the ionization status of the cysteine thiols. Thus, the chemistry of the thiols might render the cysteine less inert than, say, an alanine. To confirm the suggested electrostatic nature of the E290 – PUFA interaction, we ask the authors to perform the following experiments, and to add the results to Figure 4A-G:</p><p>1) Test an alanine substitution (E290A) as an alternative means of charge-neutralization. If their hypothesis is correct, this mutant should phenocopy the E290C mutant with respect to DHA response and pH dependence.</p><p>2) Test a charge reversal substitution at position 290. This could be done either using an E290R mutant, or by modification of E290C with MTSET<sup>+</sup>.</p><p>All these experiments should be attainable in two months of time.</p></body></sub-article><sub-article article-type="reply" id="SA2"><front-stub><article-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.37257.014</article-id><title-group><article-title>Author response</article-title></title-group></front-stub><body><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Essential revisions:</p><p>All three of us share a single concern which we request the authors address.

To eliminate that risk, we have now included experiments using the E290A mutant, as an alternative means of charge neutralization, and DTT together with the E290C mutant, to prevent disulphide-bond formation. The pH dependence of the DHA response for both E290A+E1 and E290C+E1 in DTT largely overlay with the pH dependence of the DHA response for Kv7.1 alone and E290C+E1 without DTT. These new experiments lend further support to the hypothesis that it is the lack of the negative charge on E290 that removes the effect of KCNE1 on DHA protonation.</p><p>We have also performed experiments using the E290R mutant, to test if introduction of a positive charge at position 290 can further promote deprotonation of the DHA head. We find that the apparent pKa of the DHA effect on K<sub>V</sub>7.1/E290R+E1 is lower than for K<sub>V</sub>7.1/E290A+E1, which suggests that a positive charge at position 290 further shifts the pH dependence of the DHA response towards lower pH values.</p><p>We feel that these three sets of new control data mainly contribute to the interpretation of the data presented in Figure 3. Therefore, these new data are presented as Figure 3—figure supplement 1A-B.</p></body></sub-article></article>
