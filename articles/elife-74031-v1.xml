Hence, metazoans have evolved mechanisms to adapt to low oxygen. One such mechanism, metabolic suppression, decreases the cellular demand for oxygen by downregulating ATP-demanding processes. However, the molecular mechanisms underlying this adaptation are poorly understood. Here, we report on the role of <italic>ndrg1a</italic> in hypoxia adaptation of the anoxia-tolerant zebrafish embryo. <italic>ndrg1a</italic> is expressed in the kidney and ionocytes, cell types that use large amounts of ATP to maintain ion homeostasis. <italic>ndrg1a</italic> mutants are viable and develop normally when raised under normal oxygen. However, their survival and kidney function is reduced relative to WT embryos following exposure to prolonged anoxia. We further demonstrate that Ndrg1a binds to the energy-demanding sodium-potassium ATPase (NKA) pump under anoxia and is required for its degradation, which may preserve ATP in the kidney and ionocytes and contribute to energy homeostasis. Lastly, we show that sodium azide treatment, which increases lactate levels under normoxia, is sufficient to trigger NKA degradation in an Ndrg1a-dependent manner. These findings support a model whereby Ndrg1a is essential for hypoxia adaptation and functions downstream of lactate signaling to induce NKA degradation, a process known to conserve cellular energy.</p></abstract><kwd-group kwd-group-type="author-keywords"><kwd>NDRG1</kwd><kwd>hypoxia</kwd><kwd>anoxia</kwd><kwd>hypometabolism</kwd><kwd>lactate</kwd><kwd>sodium-potassium pump</kwd></kwd-group><kwd-group kwd-group-type="research-organism"><title>Research organism</title><kwd>Zebrafish</kwd></kwd-group><funding-group><award-group id="fund1"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000005</institution-id><institution>U.S. Department of Defense</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>W81XWH-16-1-0466</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Lee</surname><given-names>Young-Sam</given-names></name><name><surname>Brewster</surname><given-names>Rachel</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund2"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000002</institution-id><institution>National Institutes of Health</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>R21HD089476</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Lee</surname><given-names>Young-Sam</given-names></name><name><surname>Brewster</surname><given-names>Rachel</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund3"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000002</institution-id><institution>National Institutes of Health</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>T34 HHS 00001</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Gabel</surname><given-names>Austin M</given-names></name><name><surname>Osei-Ntansah</surname><given-names>Afia</given-names></name><name><surname>Canales</surname><given-names>Bryanna</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund4"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000011</institution-id><institution>Howard Hughes Medical Institute</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Gabel</surname><given-names>Austin M</given-names></name><name><surname>Osei-Ntansah</surname><given-names>Afia</given-names></name><name><surname>Canales</surname><given-names>Bryanna</given-names></name><name><surname>Viswanathan</surname><given-names>Soujanya</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund5"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000002</institution-id><institution>National Institute of Health</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>T34 GM136497</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Viswanathan</surname><given-names>Soujanya</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><funding-statement>The funders had no role in study design, data collection and interpretation, or the decision to submit the work for publication.</funding-statement></funding-group><custom-meta-group><custom-meta specific-use="meta-only"><meta-name>Author impact statement</meta-name><meta-value>Lactate-Ndrg1a signaling protects the kidney from hypoxic injury and functions partly by inducing reversible degradation of the ATP-demanding sodium-potassium ATPase pump.</meta-value></custom-meta></custom-meta-group></article-meta></front><body><sec id="s1" sec-type="intro"><title>Introduction</title><p>Hypoxia contributes to multiple disease conditions, including acute kidney injury (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib63">Shu et al., 2019</xref>), pulmonary hypertension (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Bosc et al., 2010</xref>), obstructive sleep apnea (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Douglas et al., 2010</xref>), neurodegenerative disease (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib52">Peers et al., 2009</xref>), and ischemia/stroke (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib76">Won et al., 2002</xref>). Despite these hypoxia-related pathological outcomes, low oxygen is encountered in many environments, such as at high altitude, overwintering in frozen ponds, embryonic development <italic>in utero</italic> and in the center of solid tumors. Hence, metazoans have evolved mechanisms to adapt to hypoxia and maintain homeostasis. These adaptations differ among cell types and species and the degree of protection they confer; however, they generally involve enhanced oxygen delivery, autophagy to recycle cellular constituents, and metabolic reprogramming (switch from oxidative phosphorylation to glycolysis) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Bellot et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Guillemin and Krasnow, 1997</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib58">Semenza, 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib78">Xie and Simon, 2017</xref>). Important mediators of such responses include hypoxia inducible factor 1Î± (Hif1Î±), a transcription factor that is stabilized by low oxygen (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib59">Semenza, 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib73">Wang and Semenza, 1995</xref>) and AMP-activated kinase (AMPK), whose activation is triggered by an increase in AMP or reactive oxygen species levels (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Dengler, 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib48">Oakhill et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib77">Xiao et al., 2011</xref>). In addition, cells adapt to chronic and severe hypoxia via metabolic suppression, a mechanism that preserves energy via reorganization of metabolic priorities for ATP expenditure, suppression of energy-demanding cell functions (e.g. ion pumping, transcription, translation, cell cycle arrest) and changes in gene expression that support hypometabolism (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib66">Storey and Storey, 2007</xref>). In particular, downregulation of ion pumps such as NKA, a major utilizer of cellular ATP, is a key aspect of metabolic suppression (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Bogdanova et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Buck and Hochachka, 1993</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Gusarova et al., 2011</xref>). In alveolar cells, this process depends on activation of AMPK (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Gusarova et al., 2011</xref>).</p><p>The NDRG family consists of four members (NDRG 1â4) that belong to the Î±âÎ² hydrolase superfamily, however, they lack the catalytic domain to be enzymatically active (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib61">Shaw et al., 2002</xref>). Several members of this family have altered expression in cancer cells and tumor suppressor or oncogenic functions that impact cell proliferation, differentiation and metastasis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib45">Melotte et al., 2010</xref>). NDRGs are also implicated in stress response and some members are transcriptionally up-regulated, in a Hif1Î±-dependent manner, following exposure to hypoxia (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Angst et al., 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Cangul, 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Chen et al., 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">Le et al., 2021</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib45">Melotte et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib51">Park et al., 2000</xref>). In hypoxic cancer cells, NDRG3 is stabilized by lactate and promotes angiogenesis and cell growth via activation of the Raf-ERK pathway (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib41">Lee et al., 2015</xref>). NDRG1 (formerly known as Drg1, Cap43, Rit42, RTP, and PROXY-1) protects human trophoblasts from hypoxic injury by triggering an anti-apoptotic response (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Chen et al., 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Choi et al., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib56">Roh et al., 2005</xref>). While NDRGs are clearly implicated in the stress response, their physiological roles in hypoxia adaptation of normal cells are mostly unknown.</p><p>The zebrafish genome encodes six <italic>ndrg</italic> family members that are highly homologous to mammalian <italic>NDRGs</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib45">Melotte et al., 2010</xref>). We have previously shown that <italic>ndrg1a</italic> mRNA is up-regulated nine fold in zebrafish embryos exposed to prolonged anoxia (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">Le et al., 2021</xref>), despite a general suppression of transcription under severe hypoxia (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib66">Storey and Storey, 2007</xref>). These observations suggest that <italic>ndrg1a</italic> plays an essential role in hypoxia adaptation. <italic>ndrg1a</italic> is primarily expressed in the embryonic kidney (pronephric duct or PD) and ionocytes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">Le et al., 2021</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib68">Thisse et al., 2001</xref>), cell types that maintain ion homeostasis via the activity of membrane pumps and ion transporters (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Hwang and Chou, 2013</xref>).</p><p>We report here on the function of <italic>ndrg1a</italic> in the anoxia-tolerant zebrafish embryo, which can survive up to 50 hr of anoxia in a state of reversible arrest (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib46">Mendelsohn et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib50">Padilla and Roth, 2001</xref>). While <italic>ndrg1a</italic> is expressed in the PD and ionocytes, it is not required for the differentiation or function of these cells under normal conditions (normoxia). We rather found that <italic>ndrg1a</italic> promotes organismal survival and protects the kidney from hypoxic injury following exposure to prolonged anoxia. Under normoxic conditions, Ndrg1a spatially overlaps with NKA in the PD and ionocytes, but these proteins appear to interact minimally. Following prolonged anoxia, elevated lactate levels (the end product of glycolysis) may be sufficient to enhance Ndrg1a and NKA interaction, which precedes NKA degradation via the lysosomal/proteasomal pathways; a response known to preserve ATP in hypoxia-tolerant organisms. In support of this model, we show that treatment of zebrafish embryos exposed to anoxia in the presence of ouabain, a general NKA inhibitor, rescues ATP levels. We thus propose that Ndrg1a is essential for hypoxia adaptation and functions downstream of lactate signaling to regulate energy-demanding cellular targets, including NKA.</p></sec><sec id="s2" sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><sec id="s2-1"><title><italic>ndrg1a</italic> is not required for kidney and ionocyte differentiation or function</title><p>We have previously shown that <italic>ndrg1a</italic> is a hypoxia-responsive gene whose transcript levels increase proportionately with the severity and duration of hypoxia (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">Le et al., 2021</xref>), suggesting that <italic>ndrg1a</italic> is implicated in hypoxia adaptation.

To further test this prediction, we adapted isothermal calorimetry in conjunction with anoxia treatment to measure heat dissipation in whole zebrafish embryos as a readout for metabolic suppression, which is tied to the activity of NKA and other energy-demanding processes.

Early embryos have a relatively homogenous cell population, facilitating the identification of candidate small molecules. Furthermore, they arrest rapidly following anoxia exposure (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib50">Padilla and Roth, 2001</xref>), which provides a convenient read out for metabolic suppression.

However, the mechanisms by which they function in the physiological adaptation of normal cells to low oxygen are, for the most part, unknown. We uncover here a novel and essential role for Ndrg1a in promoting long-term adaptation to hypoxia possibly via metabolic regulation. Overall, our findings support a model whereby prolonged and severe hypoxia activates or enhances Ndrg1a signaling in the zebrafish embryo downstream of lactate. Activated Ndrg1a accelerates the rate of endocytosis and degradation of the energy-demanding NKA pump in the PD and ionocytes, which may preserve ATP. The high level of homology between NDRG1 in vertebrates along with evidence pointing towards conserved molecular interactions, suggest that the proposed model for Ndrg1a signaling may be broadly applicable.</p><sec id="s3-1"><title>Ndrg1a as a molecular switch for long-term adaptation to hypoxia</title><p>Given that the molecular cascade leading to ATP1A1A internalization and degradation is triggered by prolonged anoxia and dependent on <italic>ndrg1a</italic>, we propose that Ndrg1a functions as a molecular switch for long-term adaptation to hypoxia. The mechanisms underlying Ndrg1a activation have not been fully elucidated, however two non-mutually exclusive models can be envisaged, which we have coined quantitative vs. qualitative. In the quantitative model, Ndrg1a normoxic activity is enhanced in response to hypoxia, possibly via post-translational modifications (PTM) and/or transcriptional up-regulation of <italic>ndrg1a</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">Le et al., 2021</xref>). Consistent with this model, we have shown that <italic>ndrg1a</italic> is required to maintain normoxic levels of NKA in the plasma membrane and to accelerate NKA degradation under hypoxia. Others have reported on similar NDRG1-dependent regulation of LDLR and E-Cadherin levels under normal oxygen (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Kachhap et al., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib53">PietiÃ¤inen et al., 2013</xref>), however it is unknown whether such activities are enhanced under hypoxia.</p><p>In the qualitative model, Ndrg1a acquires new properties under hypoxia due to a PTM or binding to a small molecule, which brings about a change in protein conformation and/or binding partner affinity. In support of this model, a previous study showed that binding of lactate to NDRG3 in hypoxic cancer cells is sufficient to stabilize NDRG3 and activate Raf-ERK signaling (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib41">Lee et al., 2015</xref>). We have shown that sodium azide treatment, which blocks oxidative-phosphorylation and increases the intracellular concentration of lactate, is sufficient to induce ATP1A1A degradation under normoxic conditions in an Ndrg1a-dependent manner. While several metabolites could function downstream of sodium azide as effectors of this response, our data point to lactate as a prime candidate.</p><p>There is currently no consensus on the molecular role of activated NDRG1 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib45">Melotte et al., 2010</xref>), however we favor the idea that Ndrg1a functions as an adapter protein to link protein-binding partners together. Indeed, there is a growing list of NDRG1 binding partners that localize to several cellular compartments (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib70">Tu et al., 2007</xref>). Our findings suggest that one of the protein complexes that NDRG1 could bring together under hypoxic conditions includes ATP1A1A, endosomal components and/or protein degradation machinery.</p></sec><sec id="s3-2"><title>Hypoxia-induced NKA downregulation as a mechanism to preserve ATP</title><p>The NKA isoforms that are expressed in the kidney are essential for the active translocation of Na<sup>+</sup> and K<sup>+</sup> ions across the membrane and in the secondary active transport of other solutes, including glucose (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Katz, 1982</xref>). The cost of operating NKA is considerable, and hence an evolutionarily conserved response to hypoxia is to downregulate this pump to conserve ATP. Mechanisms of downregulation include reducing pump activity (inactivation via several redox-sensitive modifications) and/or triggering its endocytosis and degradation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Bogdanova et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Buck and Hochachka, 1993</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Gusarova et al., 2011</xref>). We confirm that NKA inhibition, via Ouabain treatment, preserves ATP in zebrafish embryos exposed to prolonged anoxia. Whether Ndrg1a-mediated NKA degradation conserves energy in kidney and ionocytes is less clear, as tools to measure ATP levels in specific tissues and cells are currently lacking.</p><p>To what extent does Ndrg1a-mediated degradation of NKA contribute to hypometabolism? Energy preservation via metabolic suppression is a relatively rapid and organism-wide response, resulting in developmental arrest in early embryos. In contrast, Ndrg1a activation is slow (taking place over several hours) and spatially restricted, suggesting that it is a tissue-specific, last resort response to preserve the kidney and ionocytes. Consistent with the delayed and localized activity of Ndrg1a, we observed that <italic>ndrg1a</italic><sup>-/-</sup> mutants are largely able to establish metabolic suppression. However, energy homeostasis appears to be disrupted in the mutants, aligning with the low survival data following prolonged anoxia (24 hr). We thus propose that Ndrg1a maintains energy homeostasis by reducing energy usage in the kidney and ionocytes.</p><p>In order for NKA downregulation to be considered a hypoxia adaptation, it would have to be reversible upon return to normoxia, which we have confirmed. The cellular source of the post-anoxia protein is unknown, but may involve intracellular stores of endocytosed NKA and/or protein synthesized <italic>de novo</italic>. The former could provide an immediate source of NKA for rapid restoration of pump activity, while the latter, a more delayed response, could fully replenish the cellâs NKA supply.</p></sec><sec id="s3-3"><title>Context-specific function of NDRG1</title><p>Our data support a physiological role for <italic>ndrg1a</italic> in hypoxia-induced NKA degradation. The NKA pump plays an important role in freshwater teleosts such as zebrafish. These fish are faced with the challenge of potential over-hydration and salt depletion, since their body fluids are hyperosmotic with respect to the environment. To compensate for the tendency towards water influx, zebrafish excrete large volumes of water and limit NaCl loss via reabsorption of Na<sup>+</sup> and Cl<sup>-</sup> in the kidney distal (collecting) duct and bladder, and also through ionocyte-dependent absorption of these ions from the environment (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib67">Takvam et al., 2021</xref>). Consistent with these findings, zebrafish NKA is expressed more highly in the posterior PD, where its activity may power the bulk of Na<sup>+</sup> reabsorption. PLA further revealed regional differences in the manner in which NKA is regulated in the anterior and posterior PD, as ATP1A1A and Ndrg1a appear to interact in posterior cells even under normoxic conditions. It is possible that, owing to the high level of activity of NKA in the posterior tubules, there is a build up of lactate in these cells. If correct, constitutive Ndrg1a-ATP1A1A interaction in posterior cells may prime them for a more effective response to hypoxia.</p><p>Studies in amphibians show that NDRG1 controls cell differentiation of endodermal organs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">Kyuno et al., 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib80">Zhang et al., 2013</xref>), with no indication of a physiological role for this protein. It is unclear what accounts for the difference in NDRG1 function between teleosts and amphibians, but one possibility is the increased number of <italic>Ndrg</italic> paralogs in zebrafish (6 NDRGs in zebrafish versus 4 in <italic>Xenopus laevis</italic>). This increase might have enabled functional diversification of some members of the NDRG family and for <italic>ndrg1a</italic> in particular to evolve a role in hypoxia adaptation. However, there is ample evidence in mouse and human cells that NDRG1 is hypoxia-responsive (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib45">Melotte et al., 2010</xref>), making this an unlikely explanation. Alternatively, <italic>ndrg1a</italic> may be required for PD and ionocyte differentiation but its function is masked by other members of the NDRG family that compensate for <italic>ndrg1a</italic> LOF.</p></sec><sec id="s3-4"><title>NDRG1 and ion homeostasis</title><p>While NKA degradation preserves ATP, the loss of this pump can cause a rise in intracellular Na<sup>+</sup> concentration and subsequent water influx, culminating in cellular edema (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Bogdanova et al., 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib40">Leaf, 1956</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib47">Mudge, 1951</xref>). However, hypoxia-tolerant organisms are thought to counter NKA depletion with a general reduction in membrane permeability via blockage of leak and water channels (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Boutilier, 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Doll et al., 1991</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">LaMacchia and Roth, 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib43">Lutz and Nilsson, 1997</xref>).

We further speculate that NDRG1 may negatively regulate ion transporters in zebrafish embryos, in addition to mediating NKA degradation. Indeed, <italic>ndrg1a<sup>-/-</sup></italic> mutants exposed to prolonged anoxia develop severe edema. Moreover, NDRG1 is known to interact with ion transport regulator FXYD (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Arystarkhova et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib79">Yang et al., 2016</xref>) and the level of several ion transporters in cichlids exposed to high salinity was shown to be inversely proportional to that of NDRG1 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">KÃ¼ltz et al., 2013</xref>).

Your article has been reviewed by 2 peer reviewers, and the evaluation has been overseen by a Reviewing Editor and Didier Stainier as the Senior Editor. The reviewers have opted to remain anonymous.</p><p>The reviewers have discussed their reviews with one another, and the Reviewing Editor has drafted this to help you prepare a revised submission.</p><p>Essential revisions:</p><p>1) A weakness is lack of direct data to characterize &quot;metabolic suppression&quot; and evidence linking NKA degradation and metabolic suppression to organismic adaptation and survival against hypoxia. Can the authors clarify role of NKA abundance on metabolic suppression. Furthermore, the parameters used to define metabolic suppression needs to be clarified. As of now the data seems to support the role of NDRG1a in regulating NKA abundance.</p><p>2) There was questions that had to do with methodology and statistics. In some cases the overall sample size was small for what is expected within the field (N and n), there were questions about hybridization technique, proper mounting of the embryos, stage of development (may need to note somite number), and use of controls as noted by reviewers. For example, regarding Figure 6D although anoxia induces arrest, may need to determine if some level of development occurred and quantify lactate level with normoxia control (same developmental stage). For several of the experiments/graphs the statistical methods used and P values were not provided. Review each graph and note method and significant differences.</p><p>3) Reviewers point out several conclusions that need to be toned down given that the results do not completely support the conclusion provided.</p><p><italic>Reviewer #1 (Recommendations for the authors):</italic></p><p>1. It would help strengthen the paper if the authors could clarify the contribution of changes in NKA abundance in metabolic suppression and organismic survival against hypoxia. If the authors claim this regulatory axis does play a causal role, it would be helpful to consider whether genetic or pharmacological manipulation of NKA or ATP1A1A can affect organismic survival against anoxia/hypoxia in wt and ndrg1a mutants. The best experiment would be testing a genetically modified and degradation resistant atp1a1a allele, or an allele of ndrg1a that specifically interfaces with NKA, but it remains challenging since the underlying molecular mechanism of NKA degradation by ndrg1a is largely unknown.</p><p>2, The authors used &quot;metabolic suppression&quot; throughout the paper, but did not have a clear definition described or specific metabolic parameters measured. Quite unexpectedly, ATP levels as authors showed actually increased at 6 hrs after anoxia, and ndrg1a dependent changes of ATP levels did not occur until 12 hrs after anoxia though NKA degradation was already evident at 6 hrs. At what time points and by what measures do the author mean &quot;metabolic suppression&quot;? What explains the discrepancy between ATP and NKA levels at 6 hrs?</p><p>3, The authors used the Whole-mount proximity ligation assay (PLA) assay to infer protein-protein interaction between NDRG1a and NKA. While this assay convincingly showed these two are in very close proximity in vivo, it does not exclude the possibility that they interact indirectly via other proteins. The authors may need to tone down and clarify this point, or verify whether they indeed bind to each other directly, e.g. by in vitro biochemistry and ectopic expression in heterologous systems (Y2H etc).</p><p><italic>Reviewer #2 (Recommendations for the authors):</italic></p><p>Across the manuscript the stage of embryos in the assays is not performed correctly. Supplemental figure 1 is a prime example as the larvae analyzed for ndgr1 expression clearly do not match one another. For example the std mo is much younger that the WT and the morphant is older. the conclusions therefore cannot be adequately supported by the different stages.</p><p>The <italic>in situ</italic> hybridizations are plagued by significant background and for many genes, appropriate probes/images have been published showing much less head staining. For example see images for slc20a1a. Critical conclusions in Figure 1 are drawn from the <italic>in situ</italic> hybridizations and they are not overall of good quality, equivalent stages, have high background, and do not include sense controls. Also in Figure 1 the ATP1a1a protein is thought to be equal but clearly looks increased in mutants. It requires some quantification and likely more embryos. In addition, the sagittal mounting is inconsistent across the paper. Some are appropriate but others are curved on a different angled plane complicating analysis. They should be performed again.</p><p>In Figure 2E, the mutants already have edema, this assay would be more accurate if you compare mutants without edema with wildtype without edema.</p><p>Figure 3a2 the image is not mounted correctly. In many of the fluorescent images it can be noted that the yolk or yolk extension of different samples is unique. Or that the magnification area/region seems different. Also in the survival assays there is a mention of the scanning for necrosis, however no details in this area are provided in the methods and it is only vaguely addressed.</p><p>In other images of Figure 3 the regions and zoom appear to be different. On b4, you can clearly see the otic placode but on the other images you cannot. Are these taken at the same resolution. the quantification in C is also unclear. What is it normalized too? Is there statistical analysis performed at individual time points for (C). The transverse sections are also difficult to know where and what region we are looking and if they are equivalent sections.</p><p>The increased expression of ATP1a1 is a conclusion that is inconsistent with Figure 1. Specifically, situ hybs in Figure 1, where kidney development and the PD were concluded to be normal. However kcnj1a.1 ionocytes also look to be increased in mo and mut.</p><p>Can there be an explanation regarding how embryos are genotyped for assays such as the ATP.</p><p>This manuscript is intriguing and of interest, however the figures lack sense controls, have high background, are not mounted appropriately, and in many cases the age of the embryos is in question. These changes are likely required to substantiate the authors claims.</p></body></sub-article><sub-article article-type="reply" id="sa2"><front-stub><article-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.74031.sa2</article-id><title-group><article-title>Author response</article-title></title-group></front-stub><body><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Essential revisions:</p><p>1) A weakness is lack of direct data to characterize &quot;metabolic suppression&quot; and evidence linking NKA degradation and metabolic suppression to organismic adaptation and survival against hypoxia.

As of now the data seems to support the role of NDRG1a in regulating NKA abundance.</p></disp-quote><p>Metabolic suppression is a survival response to preserve energy that is activated by environmental stressors such as low oxygen or lack of food. Mechanisms underlying this response include reorganization of metabolic priorities for ATP expenditure, suppression of energy-demanding cell functions (e.g. ion pumping, transcription, translation, cell cycle arrest) and changes in gene expression that support hypometabolism (Storey and Storey, 2007). In the zebrafish embryo, prolonged exposure to zero oxygen (anoxia) triggers a hypometabolic state that is manifested by developmental and physiological (heartbeat, response to touch) arrest (Padilla and Roth, 2001). The signaling mechanisms that trigger this organism-level response are currently unknown, but lactate is a candidate proximal signal (Lee, 2021). We have now more clearly defined metabolic suppression on page 3-4 of the Introduction.</p><p>To clarify, we did not mean to imply that Ndrg1a-mediated NKA degradation is the sole axis of the anoxia response. Our model (p 34 of the Results section in the original manuscript -initial submission), which we have now moved to the Discussion section on page 26, is that Ndrg1a-mediated NKA downregulation and apparent concomitant reduction in ATP hydrolysis may contribute to hypometabolism. However, metabolic suppression in the zebrafish embryo is an early and organism-wide response, while Ndrg1a expression is spatially restricted and its activation is delayed relative to the onset of anoxia. These findings suggest that Ndrg1a activation is likely to be triggered downstream of hypometabolism.</p><p>To address the concern of Reviewer 1 that we did not directly measure metabolic suppression, we developed isothermal calorimetry (ITC) as an assay to quantify heat flux in the intact zebrafish embryo, in response to anoxia. Heat dissipation is closely tied to the activity of NKA and other energy-demanding processes and hence is an indirect measure of hypometabolism (Buck et al., 1993). Using ITC, we now show that heat dissipation is decreased in WT and <italic>ndrg1a<sup>-/-</sup></italic> mutant embryos exposed to prolonged anoxia, relative to their respective normoxic controls (Figure 5âfigure supplement 1). These data support the model that metabolic suppression occurs in response to anoxia and is not dependent on Ndrg1a activity in the kidney. However, we noted that ITC values measured for <italic>ndrg1a<sup>-/-</sup></italic> mutants were lower than for WT embryos, suggestive of a disruption in energy homeostasis. The ITC experiment is described in Material and Methods and the ITC data can be found in the Results section, page 19 and Figure 5âfigure supplement 1.</p><p>Our ability to directly test the contribution of NKA degradation in the kidney to hypoxia tolerance was hampered by a lack of experimental tools. To our knowledge, there are no <italic>atp1a1a</italic> mutations or drugs that prevent NKA degradation. Furthermore, repetition of measurements of total ATP in <italic>ndrg1a</italic> mutants to increase sample size numbers (as requested by Reviewer 2) did not support the earlier conclusion that NKA degradation conserves energy (Figure 5F), most likely because ATP generated in kidney cells is a small fraction of total ATP levels. That said, NKA downregulation is a conserved response to hypoxia that has been linked to energy conservation, and hence is thought to contribute to enhanced survival; at least in hypoxia-tolerant organisms (Bogdanova et al., 2005; Bogdanova et al., 2016; Buck and Hochachka, 1993). We now confirm that Ouabain treatment (12 hours) of WT zebrafish embryos exposed to prolonged anoxia can rescue global ATP levels to values observed for 6 hours of anoxia exposure (Figure 5G), confirming that NKA inhibition preserves energy under hypoxia.</p><p>We thus propose that NKA downregulation may play a beneficial role in hypoxia tolerance but have toned down the strength of these conclusions in the Discussion section on page 26.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>2) There was questions that had to do with methodology and statistics. In some cases the overall sample size was small for what is expected within the field (N and n), there were questions about hybridization technique, proper mounting of the embryos, stage of development (may need to note somite number), and use of controls as noted by reviewers.

Reviewer 2 had questions about the method used to assess survival using necrosis as a readout â in particular as this method pertains to the selection of embryos for the ATP assay. Our methodology, which is now described in Material and Methods on page 41, entailed initially identifying parameters indicative of a âdead phenotypeâ, by setting aside anoxia-exposed embryos with different levels of tissue damage and scoring for survival post-reoxygenation. Characteristic of dead embryos include: opaque appearance, tissue damage, swollen body with extensive edema and detached yolk. Thus embryos exhibiting one or more of these characteristic were classified as dead or dying and were not used in subsequent analyses.</p><p>Quantification and Statistics. Reviewer 2 had questions about the quantification in Figure 3C. To clarify, measurements were normalized to the highest fluorescence intensity value in the entire set. We also provided (previously) the 2-way ANOVA analysis for both C1 (anterior) and C2 (posterior) data sets. In fact, all graphs and figures with p-values were supplemented with a description of statistical methods in the figure legend, along with corresponding p-values and the full statistical analysis was compiled in an excel spreadsheet.</p><p>Sample size. We agree that some sample sizes were on the smaller end, in particular those for the <italic>in situ</italic> hybridization experiments. However, in some cases, the sample size was adequate but we listed the number of embryos <italic>imaged</italic> rather than the total number of embryos processed and visually scored without imaging. Since we repeated the <italic>in situ</italic> hybridization procedure to improve the quality of the images (Figure 1 and Figure 1âfigure supplement 2), we also increased the sample size for those experiments. Sample size was also increased for the total ATP measurements, which resulted in a change in our conclusion (Figure 5F and Results page 18). For other experiments, we went back to our spreadsheets and included, where appropriate, all specimens that were qualitatively analyzed, whether micrographs were generated or not. These edits appear in Figure legends.</p><p>Staging and imaging issues.</p><p>Quality. To improve the quality of the images, we used an improved wholemount ISH procedure that reduces background label. We further ensured that control embryos were stage-matched to experimental embryos and that all specimens were mounted properly and imaged at the same magnification (Figure 1A and Figure 1âfigure supplement 2). With regards to Figure 3B specifically, we have provided a new set of images for the IF experiment to ensure consistency between the area of the yolk extension that is in view and confirmed that the specimens in panel Figure 3B were imaged at the same resolution and light intensity.</p><p>Controls for <italic>in situ</italic> hybridization. We have now provided images of embryos labeled with control sense riboprobes in Figure 1âfigure supplement 2. These embryos have little to no label, suggesting that the signal generated with anti-sense probes in Figure 1A is specific.</p><p>Issue with lactate experiment â Figure 6D<italic>.</italic> A concern was raised about whether differential lactate levels between normoxic controls and anoxia-treated experimental groups reflect variation in developmental stage rather than response to anoxia exposure. We agree that this is a potential issue given that we used age-matched (24 hpf) rather than stage-matched (27 hpf) normoxic controls. We have now included stage-matched controls and do not observe significant differences in lactate levels relative to the age-matched experimental groups. These data are shown in Figure 6D. In addition, we have also included stage-matched controls for the ATP assay with additional experiments (Figure 5F).</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>3) Reviewers point out several conclusions that need to be toned down given that the results do not completely support the conclusion provided.</p></disp-quote><p>We have edited our Abstract, Results (pages 18, 19) and Discussion (page 26) to provide a more conservative interpretation of the data.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Reviewer #1 (Recommendations for the authors):</p><p>1.

One possible explanation is that, at this time point, there is a residual pool of ATP generated from oxidative-phosphorylation and an increase in ATP production from glycolysis that combine to produce this spike. In addition, Ndrg1a-independent ATP-conserving responses may be activated prior to 6 hours of anoxia that further contribute to the increase in ATP levels.</p><p>With regards to the timing of events, PLA reveals an interaction between Ndrg1a and NKA beginning at 6 hours in the posterior kidney, which coincides with the onset of NKA degradation. We can unfortunately not comment on when ATP preservation occurs given that the assay to measure total ATP levels was not sensitive enough to detect changes that occur specifically in the kidney and ionocytes across all samples tested.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>3, The authors used the Whole-mount proximity ligation assay (PLA) assay to infer protein-protein interaction between NDRG1a and NKA.

However kcnj1a.1 ionocytes also look to be increased in mo and mut.</p></disp-quote><p>Our conclusion may not have been stated clearly, leading to some confusion. We proposed that ATP1A1A is regulated by Ndrg1a at the post-translational rather than transcriptional level (via lysosomal or proteasomal degradation); hence, in <italic>ndrg1a</italic> morpholino-injected embryos and mutants, <italic>atp1a</italic> mRNA level is normal (Figure 1) but ATP1A1A protein level is high relative to WT controls (Figure 3). With respect to <italic>kcnj1a.1</italic> expression in ionocytes, the apparent increase in signal may be due to the high level of background in the initial images. Having repeated the wholemount <italic>in situ</italic> hybridization with a new blocking reagent that reduces background, <italic>kcnj1a.1</italic> expression level is similar across all experimental groups (refer to revised Figure 1A).</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Can there be an explanation regarding how embryos are genotyped for assays such as the ATP.</p></disp-quote><p>Our methodology, which is now described in Material and Methods on page 41, entailed initially identifying parameters indicative of a âdead phenotypeâ, by setting aside anoxia-exposed embryos with different levels of tissue damage and scoring for survival post-reoxygenation. Characteristic of dead embryos include: opaque appearance, tissue damage, swollen body with extensive edema and detached yolk. Thus embryos exhibiting one or more of these characteristic were classified as dead or dying and were not used in subsequent analyses.</p><p>For the ATP assay, both WT and <italic>ndrg1a</italic> mutant embryos are quickly examined under the bright field objective (in anoxic water) for the criteria described above and immediately snap-frozen in dry ice following the removal of excess solution.</p><p><bold>References</bold></p><list list-type="order"><list-item><p>Buck, L.
