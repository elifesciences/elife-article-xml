receptor stimulation and activation of the Ca<sup>2+</sup>-NFAT and JNK-AP1 pathways. CRACR2A has been linked to human diseases in numerous genome-wide association studies, however, to date no patient with damaging variants in CRACR2A has been identified. In this study, we describe a patient harboring biallelic variants in <italic>CRACR2A</italic> [paternal allele c.834 gaG&gt; gaT (p.E278D) and maternal alelle c.430 Aga &gt; Gga (p.R144G) c.898 Gag&gt; Tag (p.E300*)], the gene encoding CRACR2A. The 33-year-old patient of East-Asian origin exhibited late onset combined immunodeficiency characterised by recurrent chest infections, panhypogammaglobulinemia and CD4+ T cell lymphopenia. In vitro exposure of patient B cells to a T-dependent stimulus resulted in normal generation of antibody-secreting cells, however the patient’s T cells showed pronounced reduction in CRACR2A protein levels and reduced proximal TCR signaling, including dampened SOCE and reduced JNK phosphorylation, that contributed to a defect in proliferation and cytokine production. Expression of individual allelic mutants in CRACR2A-deleted T cells showed that the CRACR2A<sup>E278D</sup> mutant did not affect JNK phosphorylation, but impaired SOCE which resulted in reduced cytokine production. The truncated double mutant CRACR2A<sup>R144G/E300*</sup> showed a pronounced defect in JNK phosphorylation as well as SOCE and strong impairment in cytokine production. Thus, we have identified variants in <italic>CRACR2A</italic> that led to late-stage combined immunodeficiency characterized by loss of function in T cells.</p></abstract><kwd-group

involves several signaling events. Amongst others, these include Ca<sup>2+</sup> influx and activation of the c-Jun N-terminal kinase (JNK) and p38 mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK) pathways. The Ca<sup>2+</sup> influx is initiated shorty after T cell receptor (TCR) engagement, and involves activation of phospholipase Cγ and production of inositol-1,4,5-trisphosphate (IP<sub>3</sub>). The latter binds to IP<sub>3</sub> receptors in the endoplasmic reticulum (ER) membrane, leading to receptor-mediated release of Ca<sup>2+</sup> from the ER. The Ca<sup>2+</sup> release is detected by stromal interaction molecules (STIM) - STIM1 and STIM2, which are EF-hand-containing proteins, located in the ER membrane (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Roos et al., 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Liou et al., 2005</xref>). Depletion of the ER Ca<sup>2+</sup> stores leads to Ca<sup>2+</sup>-loss from the STIM1 EF-hand causing it to multimerize and translocate to the ER in close proximity to the plasma membrane (PM). Subsequently, STIM1 binds to PM-resident ORAI1, which is the pore subunit of the Ca<sup>2+</sup> release–activated Ca<sup>2+</sup> (CRAC) channel, resulting in the opening of the channel and Ca<sup>2+</sup> influx (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Feske et al., 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">Zhang et al., 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">Vig et al., 2006</xref>). This process is otherwise known as store-operated Ca<sup>2+</sup> entry (SOCE) since it depends on the filling state of the ER Ca<sup>2+</sup> stores. The importance of Ca<sup>2+</sup> influx for lymphocyte proliferation, differentiation and function, and the role that STIM1 and ORAI1 play in these processes, is illustrated by rare primary immunodeficiency syndromes caused by autosomal recessive (AR) loss of function (LOF) or null mutations in <italic>ORAI1</italic> and <italic>STIM1</italic> genes. The affected patients tend to present from early age with varying degrees of immune defects, ranging from severe combined immunodeficiency (SCID), to milder forms, where the immune impairment is functionally evident, but not associated with any apparent immunodeficiency (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Feske et al., 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Chou et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Fuchs et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">McCarl et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Picard et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Parry et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Rice et al., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Byun et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Schaballie et al., 2015</xref>). Patients with SCID-like phenotype present with severe viral, bacterial, and fungal infections. In many cases there is associated immune dysregulation manifesting as lymphoproliferation or autoimmunity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Picard et al., 2009</xref>). In most cases it is the function rather than numbers of lymphocytes that is affected. Lastly, non-immunological manifestations are common, such as congenital muscular hypotonia, defects in dental enamel development, and anhidrosis, due to critical role of SOCE for these physiological functions (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Parry et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Rice et al., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Wang et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Lian et al., 2018</xref>).</p><p>CRAC Channel Regulator 2 A (CRACR2A) was identified as a protein that binds ORAI1/STIM1 and stabilizes their interaction to mediate SOCE in T cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Srikanth et al., 2010a</xref>). Two isoforms of the protein are expressed in T cells, a short cytoplasmic isoform CRACR2A-c, that was originally shown to bind ORAI1/STIM1 and stabilize their interaction, and a longer isoform CRACR2A-a (hereafter referred to as CRACR2A), that is a Rab GTPase. CRACR2A (also called EFCAB4B and Rab46) is abundantly expressed in T cells and belongs to a family of large Rab GTPases that also includes Rab44 and Rab45. It is a protein with multiple functional domains including an N-terminal Ca<sup>2+</sup>-binding EF-hand (also present in the shorter CRACR2A-c isoform), a protein-interacting coiled coil domain and proline-rich domain, and a C-terminal Rab GTPase domain. This long isoform is prenylated at its C terminus and predominantly localizes to vesicles and Golgi in T cells. Both the isoforms interact with ORAI1 and STIM1 and are involved in regulation of SOCE (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Srikanth et al., 2010a</xref>). In addition to regulation of SOCE, CRACR2A has also been shown to interact with Vav1 and regulate JNK phosphorylation. The GTPase domain of CRACR2A and prenylation have been shown to be necessary for its role in JNK activation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Srikanth et al., 2016</xref>).</p><p>The human <italic>CRACR2A</italic> (formerly <italic>EFCAB4B</italic>) gene is located on chromosome 12. Associations between polymorphisms in CRACR2A and human diseases have been identified from numerous genome-wide association studies (GWAS) of Parkinson disease, nonalcoholic fatty liver disease, atrial fibrillation, and chronic infection of HIV type (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Fung et al., 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Chalasani and Björnsson, 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">Tan et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Iglesias-Ussel et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Edelman et al., 2015</xref>). However, until now, CRACR2A has not directly been linked with a primary immunodeficiency (PID) in humans. Here, we describe a single case of late onset combined immunodeficiency due to biallelic variants in <italic>CRACR2A</italic> which encodes CRACR2A. One of the alleles encodes a truncated protein containing another point mutation in the EF-hand domain (CRACR2A p.[R144G/E300*], hereafter referred to as double mutant DM), whereas the other allele encodes a point mutant (CRACR2A p.E278D), with the mutation residing in the protein-interacting coiled coil region of the protein. Exogenous expression of individual allelic mutations in T cells shows that the DM impairs both SOCE as well as JNK phosphorylation, whereas p.E278D selectively impairs SOCE.</p></sec><sec id="s2" sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><sec id="s2-1"><title>Case presentation and immunological work up</title><p>We evaluated a 33-year-old male of East-Asian origin. He originally presented to gastroenterology services at the age of 19 years with chronic diarrhea. Following initial assessment, which included normal colonoscopy and negative coeliac screen, he was found to have severe panhypogammaglobulinaemia and was referred to clinical immunology for further investigations. On further questioning the patient reported a 5-year long history of recurrent lower respiratory tract infections requiring treatment with antibiotics. He also reported having a left lower lobe pneumonia at 15 years of age. He had no other significant infection history and reported being generally well during his childhood. His only other past medical history of note was appendicectomy at the age of 10 years. He had no history of developmental difficulties, dental, skin or any musculoskeletal abnormalities. He was an only child from non-consanguineous parents with no family history of PID. Shortly after presenting to immunology, he developed a left hip and iliac fossa pain and was found to have multiloculated left psoas abscess which required a computerized tomography (CT) guided drainage and prolonged antibiotic treatment. This infective episode was complicated by pulmonary embolism (incidental finding on a repeat CT scan) for which he was anticoagulated for a period of 6 months. He had no subsequent history of thromboembolic events. A detailed CT scan of his chest showed cylindrical bronchiectasis of the left lower lobe, lingua and R middle lobe.

Peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs) harvested from the patient and healthy control were stimulated with plate-coated anti-CD3 and anti-CD28 antibodies for 48 hr, following which they were further expanded for a further 4 days and then harvested for making cellular lysates. Western blot analysis using anti-CRACR2A antibodies detected reduced amounts of only the higher molecular weight band (corresponding to the long isoform) in patient samples (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2D</xref>, left panel). The antibody was targeting the N-terminal 160 amino acids of CRACR2A, and hence it should detect the ~30 KDa truncated form of the p.E300* variant, if expressed. However, we could not detect presence of any band at ~30 KDa, suggesting possibly degradation of the truncated form. To check for CRACR2A transcript levels, we used primers that were common to both isoforms, however, we detected pronounced reduction in CRACR2A transcript levels from patient samples (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2D</xref>, right panel). Further, in healthy control samples, expression of CRACR2A transcripts increased after stimulation with PMA and ionomycin by more than two-fold, but it was not upregulated in patient T cells.

Previously we showed that <italic>Cracr2a</italic> KO mice had a defect in effector of T cell functions (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">Woo et al., 2018</xref>). Hence, we further analyzed phenotypes of patient T cells, including TCR-proximal signaling events and cytokine production. Patient CD4<sup>+</sup> cells produced less IFN-γ than the ones isolated from a representative healthy donor (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4A</xref>). We extended our findings using cells from multiple healthy donors and different batches of the patient cells by checking expression of IFN-γ, IL-2, and TNF using quantitative RT-PCR (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4B</xref>) and ELISA (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4C</xref>). Expression of all these cytokines was impaired in patient T cells compared to control T cells derived from multiple different healthy donors. Since CRACR2A is known to interact with ORAI1 and STIM1, to regulate SOCE and JNK phosphorylation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Srikanth et al., 2010a</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Srikanth et al., 2016</xref>), we measured SOCE after anti-CD3 cross-linking as well as passive depletion of the ER Ca<sup>2+</sup> stores using thapsigargin, a SERCA blocker. In both these analyses, patient cells showed significant reduction in SOCE, when compared to those from representative healthy controls (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4D and E</xref>). Further, patient T cells also showed a profound defect in JNK phosphorylation upon TCR cross-linking (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4F</xref>). To confirm that reduced SOCE in patient cells is not due to altered expression of CRAC channel subunits, we checked expression of ORAI1 and STIM1 in lysates of T cells from healthy controls and patient. Expression of ORAI1 and STIM1 were similar between control and patient T cells as judged by immunoblotting as well as real-time quantitative RT-PCR measurements (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s1">Figure 4—figure supplement 1</xref>).

When overexpressed in HEK293 cells, E278D and R144G/E300* mutants migrated at the expected molecular weights of ~90 and ~ 30 kDa, respectively (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5s1">Figure 5—figure supplement 1A</xref>).

Notably, even after repeated transduction the expression of R144G/E300* mutant protein was much lower than WT or E278D CRACR2A, suggesting that the transcripts of this double mutant may be unstable, similar to our observation with patient cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2D</xref>).</p><p>Similar to patient T cells, CRACR2A KO Jurkat T cells showed reduced IL-2 production (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5A</xref>). Stable expression of WT CRACR2A in these cells substantially rescued the IL-2 production defect, validating that the decrease was caused due to loss of CRACR2A. However, expression of E278D or R144G/E300* mutants showed very marginal rescue of IL-2 expression in CRACR2A KO Jurkat T cells under the same condition. We also validated these results with primary human CD4<sup>+</sup> cells.

However, the R144G/E300* mutant showed a diffuse cytoplasmic localization and was not enriched at the interface in stimulated cells. These results suggest that while E278 behaves similar to WT CRACR2A in interacting with binding partners (under our experimental conditions) as well as intracellular localization under resting and stimulated conditions, the R144G/E300* mutant is impaired in all these functions. Deletion of protein interaction domains including the PRD and the C-terminal prenylation site is likely the cause loss of binding to its partners and cytoplasmic localization of the DM.

The resulting clinical phenotype is more in keeping with antibody deficiency, although detailed immunological investigations show a combined immune defect with evidence of progressive lymphopenia and impaired T cell activation. At presentation, the patient was found to have profound panhypogammaglobulinaemia, however, subsequent investigations suggested that the intrinsic B cell function seems to be relatively preserved in this condition, and that failure of antibody production is most likely a consequence of inadequate T cell help. The same mechanism is likely to cause a reduction in the proportion of class switched memory B cells. Consequently, our investigations have focused on the function of T cells, and in particular CD4<sup>+</sup> cells due to the known role of CRACR2A in their activation and also progressive selective CD4<sup>+</sup> lymphopenia which was evident from the patient’s phenotype.</p><p>Previously we have characterized developmental and immunological phenotypes in mice with T cell-specific deletion of <italic>Cracr2a</italic>. Using 8–12 week-old animals housed in a specific pathogen free facility with limited exposure to environmental insults, we observed normal development and homeostasis of CD4<sup>+</sup> cells in <italic>Cracr2a</italic><sup>fl/fl</sup> <italic>Cd4</italic>-Cre mice (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">Woo et al., 2018</xref>). Similar to patient cells, CRACR2A KO murine T cells showed defect in SOCE as well as JNK-phosphorylation, thereby, reduction in cytokine production, suggesting conserved function of CRACR2A in mouse and human T cells. Further, within the time frame of 8–12 weeks, no lymphopenia was observed in <italic>Cracr2a</italic><sup>fl/fl</sup> <italic>Cd4</italic>-Cre mice, unlike the patient in this study, who shows progressive loss of CD4<sup>+</sup> T cells. Further studies examining T cell homeostasis in aged mice can uncover whether this phenotype is conserved in mice. It should be noted that the mice had T cell-specific deletion of <italic>Cracr2a</italic>, unlike the patient, that expresses, albeit at lower amounts, a mutant CRACR2A protein globally. Hence, patient T cells may also have indirect impact on survival, due to loss of CRACR2A in other cells/tissues.</p><p>To check the extent of function lost due to individual allelic mutants of CRACR2A, we reconstituted CRACR2A KO T cells with individual mutants. The more severe, truncated R144G/E300* mutant showed a profound impairment in both SOCE as well as JNK phosphorylation, and showed phenotypes similar to CRACR2A KO T cells. Biochemical analysis showed that the R144G/E300* mutant lost binding to all known interacting partners, including ORAI1, STIM1, and Vav1 and had localization pattern different from that of WT CRACR2A, which may contribute to its defect in function. The drastic defect of R144G/E300* mutant was expected because it does not have the C-terminal proline-rich and Rab GTPase domains, which are necessary for protein interaction and subcellular localization of CRACR2A proteins. Consequently, cells expressing the R144G/E300* mutant did not show any rescue of SOCE, JNK phosphorylation or cytokine production. The E178D point mutation on the other hand, could reconstitute the defect in JNK phosphorylation observed in CRACR2A KO T cells, retained binding to ORAI1, STIM1 and Vav1, and showed localization pattern similar to WT CRACR2A. However, in spite of being able to interact with ORAI1 and STIM1 under overexpression conditions, the E278D mutant could not rescue the SOCE defect observed in CRACR2A KO T cells. These data suggest that under physiological conditions with limiting amounts of ORAI1 and STIM1, E278D mutant may have impairment in binding to these proteins, which is not recapitulated in our biochemical experiments using overexpression. Consequently, the E278D mutant also could not rescue the defect in cytokine production observed in CRACR2A KO T cells.</p><p>Examination of patient PBMCs showed reduced expression of total CRACR2A protein, corresponding to the long isoform, suggesting that transcription/translation from both alleles contribute to total levels of endogenous CRACR2A protein. Further, in spite of multiple attempts, we could not detect any band corresponding to the R144G/E300* mutant, with an expected MW of ~35 KDa, suggesting that the mutant protein may be unstable and degraded. In support of this hypothesis, exogenous expression analysis suggested that while the E178D mutant was expressed at levels similar to WT, the R144G/E300* double mutant consistently showed lower expression (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1</xref>). Furthermore, <italic>CRACR2A</italic> transcript levels were also significantly reduced at basal level and upon stimulation in patient T cells compared to healthy control. These data suggest that impairment observed in patient T cells can be derived from multiple factors including functional defects and mRNA/protein stabilities.</p><p>In this study, we performed extensive characterization of CRACR2A variants and consequently demonstrated significant functional impairment of the patient’s T cells. However, the resulting clinical phenotype is possibly less severe than might be expected. This is not necessarily surprising, since discordance between apparent functional immune abnormalities and clinical outcome has also been seen with other inborn errors of immunity caused by mutations in STIM1 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Rice et al., 2019</xref>). Our study also focused on the effects of CRACR2A deficiency primarily on T cell function. However, our results do not exclude the possibility that CRACR2A can play a role in activation of other innate and adaptive immune cell types, which may have indirect contribution to lymphopenia observed in the patient. Further detailed analysis of other cell types in combination with <italic>Cracr2a</italic> KO mouse models will provide insight into the role of CRACR2A in the immune response. In conclusion, our results suggest that human CRACR2A insufficiency underlies progressive loss of immune competence by uncoupling TCR activation from Ca<sup>2+</sup> and MAPK signaling. Given the resultant clinical phenotype and range of associated immunological abnormalities, we propose that CRACR2A deficiency should be included within the group of combined immunodeficiency disorders in the IEI classification.</p></sec><sec id="s4" sec-type="materials|methods"><title>Materials and methods</title><table-wrap id="keyresource" position="anchor"><label>Key resources

Exome sequence data was produced by batch sequencing with other non-related samples. Samples were sonicated using a Covaris E220 Focused-ultrasonicator to fragment the DNA to a median size of approximately 250–300 bp. Libraries were generated using Agilent SureSelect XT Human All Exon V5, using a standard protocol, receiving a unique index sequence and were then pooled to form equimolar pools. These were sequenced on a 150 bp paired end Illumina HiSeq 3,000 (Illumina, San Diego, CA, United States) with an average depth of coverage of x30.</p></sec><sec id="s4-2"><title>Candidate variant selection</title><p>Exome sequences were trimmed and checked for quality control using CutAdapt (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Andrews, 2010</xref>) and FastQC (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Andrews, 2010</xref>) via Trim-galore (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Krueger, 2015</xref>). Reads were aligned to GrCh37 using BWA-MEM (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Li and Durbin, 2009</xref>). GATKv3 best practices were applied for genomic analysis. Reads were sorted and marked with Picard SortSam and MarkDuplicates (Broad Institute), respectively. The read alignments were readjusted for optimal local alignment using IndelRealigner (GATK), Base Quality Score Recalibration (GATK) was used to estimate base call accuracy by detecting systematic sequencing errors, followed by (GATK) PrintReads. HaplotypeCaller was used to produce gVCFs via local re-assembly of haplotypes. GenotypeGVCFs (GATK) was used for joint genotyping with other non-related samples and in-house controls for an analysis group size of 34 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Auwera et al., 2018</xref>). Variant Quality Score Recalibration (GATK) was used to filter out probable artifacts from the callset. A total of 719,868 variants were present for the combined cohort, with 49,891 of these variants occurring in the proband sample.</p><p>Filtering and prediction of functional consequences was performed by annotating data using Variant Effect Predictor (VEP) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">McLaren et al., 2016</xref>), Exome Variant Server (EVS), The Single Nucleotide Polymorphism database (dbSNP), ClinVar, and the Exome Aggregation Consortium and the Genome Aggregation Database (gnomAD) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Lek et al., 2016</xref>). Filtering of common variations and annotation terms was performed using the tool VCFhacks (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Parry, 2015</xref>). Candidate variants were required to pass the following filtering conditions: read frequency (count/coverage) between 20 and 100%, according to VEP-annotation at least one canonical transcript is affected with one of the following consequence: variants of the coding sequence, frameshift, missense, protein altering, splice acceptor, splice donor, or splice region; an in-frame insertion or deletion; a start lost, stop gained, or stop retained, or according to VEP a gnomAD frequency of unknown, less of equal to 0.01, or with clinical significance ‘path’.Cohort-specific filtering retained functional variants that were present in at least one case but absent for in-house filtering controls or having indication of misalignment or index swapping. The resulting candidate list of variants consisted of rare variants that were of unknown or potentially damaging significance.</p><p>Candidate variants were also annotated with terms from Gene Ontology, GeneRIF, Biogrid interaction, OMIM, NCBI summary, MGI phenotype, MorbidMap, VOC MammalianPhenotype, UniProtKB, PDB, and HMD human phenotype (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Parry, 2015</xref>). Variants were flagged if they had any annotation related to the disease phenotype, were predicted pathogenic, or were in a gene known to cause immunological responses. A filter for all known PID genes was also used to flag any candidates that may have been otherwise excluded. A total of 48 recessive candidate variants (compound heterozygous of homozygous) were identified in 34 genes. Filtering based on gene annotation removed genes with no known immunological significance.</p><p>The top gene candidate, calcium release activated channel regulator 2 A (<italic>CRACR2A</italic>) ENSG00000130038 (also annotated by previous gene symbol <italic>EFCAB4B</italic>), contained three variants; ENST00000440314 (1) missense c.430A &gt; G, p.R144G, exon 6/20, novel, 12:3788175, Ref T, Alt C, (2) missense c.834G &gt; T, p.E278D, exon 9/20, gnomAD 0.0001647 rs541326469, 12:3765501 Ref C, Alt A, and (3) stop-gained c.898G &gt; T p.E300*, exon 10/20, novel, 12:3763526 Ref C, Alt A. LDpop Tool via LDlink (with appropriate population EAS) was used to guide interpretation prior to confirmation by genomic DNA sequencing of relatives. Chr12:3763526 (p.E300*) and chr12:3788175 (p.R144G) were not in dbSNP build 151, indicating potential LD, inherited together from one parent and in trans with 12:3765501 (p.E278D). The inheritance pattern (p.[R144G;E300*];[E278D]) was confirmed by Sanger sequencing of genomic DNA in the proband, mother, maternal grandmother, and the father. Amplification of genomic DNA for Sanger sequencing was performed by the standard PCR method. PCR clean-up was performed with ExoSAP-IT (Affymetrix).

Images were processed for enhancement of brightness or contrast using Fluoview software.</p></sec><sec id="s4-8"><title>Immunoprecipitation and immunoblotting</title><p>For immunoprecipitation, 6 x His-tagged ORAI1 and 6xHis-tagged STIM1 or Vav1-GFP together with empty vector or FLAG-tagged WT CRACR2A-a, FLAG-tagged CRACR2A<sup>E278D</sup> or CRACR2A<sup>R144G, E300*</sup> was transfected into HEK293T cells. Transfected cells (2 × 10<sup>7</sup>) were lysed in lysis buffer (20 mM Tris-Cl, 2 mM EDTA, 135 mM NaCl, 10% (vol/vol) glycerol, 0.5% Igepal CA-630, protease inhibitor mixture, pH 7.5) and centrifuged at 100,000 x g for 1 hr before preclearing with protein G-Sepharose. Lysates were immunoprecipitated with anti-FLAG antibody-conjugated resin for 6 hr. Immunoprecipitates were washed five times in lysis buffer and analyzed by immunoblotting. For detection of CRACR2A-a, 5 × 10<sup>6</sup> HEK293 or CRACR2A-deficient Jurkat T cells stably expressing empty vector, FLAG-tagged WT CRACR2A-a, CRACR2A<sup>E278D</sup>, or CRACR2A<sup>R144G, E300*</sup> were lysed in in RIPA buffer (10 mM Tris-Cl pH 8.0, 1% Triton X-100, 0.1% SDS, 140 mM NaCl, 1 mM EDTA, 0.1% sodium deoxycholate and protease inhibitor cocktail [Roche]) and centrifuged to remove debris. For immunoblot analyses, lysates were separated on 10% SDS-PAGE and proteins were transferred to nitrocellulose membranes and subsequently analyzed by immunoblotting with relevant antibodies. Chemiluminescence images were acquired using an Image reader LAS-3000 LCD camera (FujiFilm).</p></sec><sec id="s4-9"><title>Human T cell culture, staining, and analysis</title><p>Peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs) were obtained under federal and state regulations from the CFAR Virology core Laboratory at UCLA that were prepared from buffy coats from healthy, unidentified adult donors using Ficoll-PAQUE gradients. PBMCs from healthy control and patient were activated for 48 hr on a plate coated with 10 µg/ml of anti-CD3 antibody (OKT3, Bio X Cell) and cultured in T cell media (DMEM containing 20% fetal bovine serum and 1% Pen-Strep) supplemented with 5 µg/ml of anti-CD28 antibody (Bio X cell), and 20 U/ml IL-2 (Peprotech) for ThN differentiation. The cells were expanded for a further 4 days with IL-2 and on day 6, cells were extensively washed and activated with 20 nM of PMA, 1 µM of ionomycin, and Brefeldin A (3 µg/ml) for 5 hr, surface stained with anti-CD4-FITC, and intracellularly stained with anti-IFN-γ-PE. CD4-FITC-positive cells were gated for analysis. For reconstitution of CRACR2A-a in CRACR2A-a-deficient PBMCs, naive CD4+ T cells were enriched by magnetic sorting from single-cell suspensions using MagniSort naive CD4+ T cell enrichment kit (catalog # 8804-6814-74) according to manufacturer’s instructions (ThermoFisher Scientific). Cells were activated and cultured as described above. Cells were infected with lentiviruses encoding cas9 together with those encoding sgRNAs targeting CRACR2A-a on day 1 and with lentiviruses encoding WT CRACR2A-a, CRACR2A<sup>E278D</sup>or CRACR2A<sup>R144G, E300*</sup> together with empty vector on day 2. 48 hr after infection, cells were selected with 1 µg/ml of puromycin and 5 µg/ml blasticidin for 16 hr and then expanded for further 2 days with fresh media. On day 7, cells were stimulated with 10 µg/ml of anti-CD3 antibody, 5 µg/ml of anti-CD28 antibody and Brefeldin A (3 µg/ml) for 5 hr, intracellularly stained with anti-IFN-γ-PE (4 S.B3). For cytokine staining, 1 × 10<sup>6</sup> Jurkat T cells were fixed with 4% p-formaldehyde for 15 mins, permeabilized with 0.5% saponin, blocked and stained with anti-IL-2-PE antibody from Thermofisher Scientific. For flow cytometry, the following human specific antibodies were used: CD4-FITC (OKT4, eBioscience), IFN-γ-PE-Cy7 (45.B3, eBioscience) and IL-2-PE (MQ1-17H12, eBioscience). Data were acquired using FACSCalibur (Becton Dickinson) or BD LSRFortessa cell analyzers and analyzed using FlowJo software (Tree Star). ELISA was performed on human PBMCs harvested from healthy control and patient for detection of IL-2 (ThermoFisher, #88-7025-88) and TNF (ThermoFisher, # 88-7324-88).</p></sec><sec id="s4-10"><title>T-(Helper) cell phenotyping</title><p>Whole EDTA blood was stained with a combination of CD3-V500, CD4-BV421, CCR6-Pe and CXCR3-Alexa-Fluoro 647 (all antibodies from Becton Dickinson, UK) at room temperature protected from light. Erythrocytes were subsequently lysed using BD red cell lysis solution and following a further 10 min incubation the samples were washed by centrifugation (1500 rmp for 6 min) using PBS/1% FBS. Following the final wash, cells were resuspended in 400 µl of PBS + 0.5% formaldehye and cells analysed using a FACSCanto II flow cytometer (BD) using FACSDIVA software.

Your article has been reviewed by 3 peer reviewers, including Apurva Sarin as the Reviewing Editor and Reviewer #1, and the evaluation has been overseen by Satyajit Rath as the Senior Editor. The following individual involved in review of your submission has agreed to reveal their identity: Svetlana Sharapova (Reviewer #3).</p><p>The reviewers have discussed their reviews with one another, and the Reviewing Editor has drafted this to help you prepare a revised submission.</p><p>Essential revisions:</p><p>The study, which is a first such analysis of CRACR2A in a patient, is an important advance understanding of this proteins function in the regulation of CRAC channels in T-cells. The following suggestions are made to address some gaps in information, to strengthen the analysis, and impact of this work.</p><p>1. In the experiments shown in Figure 6, control recordings showing calcium entry following calcium readmission to cells exposed to calcium-free solution for the same time (without anti-CD3 or thap), should be included. This signal should be subtracted from the test ones, to provide a better indication of SOCE and know by how much SOCE has been reduced by the CRACR2A mutants.</p><p>2. Figure 4: The authors show the calcium signal following crosslinking with anti-CD3 (Figure 4D) but the stimulus is ionomycin/PMA. These calcium signals (ionomycin and PMA) should be shown (healthy control and patient). There does not seem to be any calcium release in Figure 4D in the patient's cells, or the release phase is delayed. It would be helpful to see the responses in calcium-free solution (to monitor release) and then after calcium readmission. And is a 10 minutes recording time frame relevant, when cytokines are measured days later. This is relevant here because the calcium signals between control and patient are identical after 500 seconds. Over longer periods, the overall difference between the two groups (area under curve for example) might be marginal.</p><p>3. Table 1: &quot;The patient also had reduced proportion of class switched memory B cells &quot; CD27+ IgM- IgD- (switched memory) percentages, in 2017 – 14.7%, in 2019 – 7.15%, in 2021 – 5.7%, and the normal age-matched control – 5-33%. Could the basis for the conclusion about reduced proportion of class switched memory B cells be clarified?</p><p>4. Table 1: In the data on CD25+CD127- (Treg)%, in 2017 – 0,73%, in 2019 – 1.6%, the normal range for Tregs is not provided. The normal range is usually 3-10% if gated on CD4<sup>+</sup>. Could the authors provide an explanation for the Tregs deficiency in peripheral blood?</p><p>5. Table 1: Analysis of patients with deficits in STIM and Orai have revealed differences in T-regulatory, TH1 and TH17 subset dependencies on CRAC function (reported in Fuchs et al., J Immunol 2012; Feske et al. Nature 2006; McCarl et al. J. Allergy Clin. Immunol.2009; amongst others). Can the authors comment on these subsets based on the data shown in Table 1? It would be helpful if the authors position the observations made in the patient T-cells, in the context of earlier reports on STIM and Orai loss-of-function analysis in human T-cells.</p><p>6. Figure 4: The protocol for Figure 4 may be better explained. In the legend, it is stated: &quot; PBMCs were stimulated with anti-CD3 and anti-CD28 antibodies for 48 hrs and cultured for further 4 days in the presence of IL-2 before re-stimulation with PMA plus ionomycin for 5 hrs for cytokine analysis&quot;. Why was such a prolonged stimulation used? Normally, the combination of ionomycin and PMA is sufficient. And the authors are culturing for 4 days with IL-2 and then measuring IL-2 after stimulation with ionomycin/PMA for 5 hours.</p><p>7. The KO group is missing in panel 5C.</p><p>8. There is a very small difference between the calcium signals (peak and plateau) between KO+ WT and KO+DM (Figure 6B), yet the difference between these two groups on cytokine production (Figure 5) is considerably larger. This could be explained by the fact that the measurements in Figure 6 are bulk calcium recordings, whereas it is local calcium signals near Orai1 channels that drive the cytokine responses in Figure 5 through NFAT activation (e.g. papers by Kar et al.).</p><p>9. Immunoprecipitation analysis in Figure 7 shows that CRACR2A can interact with Orai1 and STIM1. Were these experiments done under resting conditions or after stimulation?</p><p>10. Have levels of STIM 1 and Orai (Orai1) proteins, been assessed in the patient T-cells? Is STIM1 translocation/puncta formation compromised by the CRACR2A mutants? This can be shown easily by expressing a tagged-STIM1 (e.g. STIM1-YFP).</p><p>Additional comments:</p><p>1. Could the authors comment on the mechanisms underpinning progressive loss of T-cells observed in the donor? An analysis of T-cell exhaustion markers; CD95 mediated apoptosis or anti-CD3 induced activation induced death in patient cells would be informative. Alternatively, does the expression of CRAC2A mutant proteins in the T-cell line affect the signalling to apoptosis? Along the same lines, can the authors comment if blunted proliferation in response to PMA + Ionomycin (Figure 1D) or x-linking CD3 associated with increased cell death of donor CD4<sup>+</sup> T-cells?</p><p>2. The manuscript would be strengthened by inclusion of direct recordings of SOCE current using the whole cell patch clamp and showing that the CRAC current is reduced when the various CRACR2A mutants are present. However, this is not vital to the conclusions drawn.</p><p>3. This is one of the first reports of a SCID associated with aberrant SOCE that does not arise from mutation in either STIM or Orai1 genes. Mutations in STIM1 or Orai1 often evoke non-immunological effects including muscular hypotonia, defective enamel production and anhidrosis, all of which are believed to be a consequence of the loss of SOCE. It would be interesting to know whether the patient in this study exhibited similar phenotypes.</p><p>4. Abstract. In the sentence, &quot;The patient exhibited late onset combined immunodeficiency characterised by recurrent chest infections, panhypogammaglobulinemia and CD4<sup>+</sup> T cell lymphopenia.&quot; I would recommend to add current age, gender, ethnicity and his full mutation.</p><p>5. P.4 line 22. &quot;He originally presented to gastroenterology services at the age of 19 years with chronic diarrhea&quot;. What about chronic diarrhea now? Is there any changes in patient's weight and/height during all period of observation?</p><p>6. P.5 line 12-14. &quot;Interestingly, biopsy of his large bowel, which was performed in 2011 for investigation of intermittent diarrhoea, showed mild non-specific inflammatory changes, but also absence of the plasma cells.&quot; Any other data from bowel biopsy? T cells? Tregs in biopsy? Information may be included in the text.</p><p>7. The discussion may include a comment on what group/table of PID classification this new disease may be included in: Humoral? Combined? Immune-dysregulation? The authors study a lot separate mutations in cell lines, do they have any data from cells obtained from patient's parents?</p><p><italic>Reviewer #1:</italic></p><p>The CRACR2A protein regulates the plasma membrane pore forming unit Orai proteins, which together with the ER membrane localized calcium sensing proteins STIM1/2, is the principal mediator of store operated calcium entry (SOCE) in cells. This study, characterizes T-cell function in an adult who was shown by whole genome sequencing and pedigree analysis to have compound (heterozygous) mutations in both alleles of the CRACR2A gene, and resultant reduced CRACR2A protein expression. Despite the observed deficits in immunoglobin production, the authors establish that B-cell function is largely unimpaired, implicating defects in T-cell function as a defining outcome. This was confirmed by immunological analysis of the affected individual's T-cells. The authors employ multiple approaches to characterize the effects of the mutations, including the over-expression of mutant proteins in T-cells with ablations of endogenous CRACR2A protein. Mechanistic insights are provided by a combination of cell biological, biochemical and functional analysis. Together, these identify molecular features underpinning regulation of calcium entry and activation of the MAPK pathway by CRAC2A in T-cells. Although the analysis is based on one patient, key observations are reproduced by recombinant protein expression, providing important mechanistic insights on CRACR2A function T-cells.</p><p>The analysis of CRACR2A in T-cell subsets, which are known to differ in their dependence on CRAC channel function are however, not addressed in this study.</p><p><italic>Reviewer #2:</italic></p><p>This study by Wu and colleagues reports the presence of compound heterozygous mutations in CRACR2A and dissects out how these cause a primary immunodeficiency in a patient of East Asian origin. This is one of the first reports of a SCID associated with aberrant SOCE that does not arise from mutation in either STIM or Orai1 genes. The authors show that the clinical characterization is a decrease in antibody production, due to lymphopenia and impaired T cell activation. Wu et al. further demonstrate that the latter arises through a reduction in store-operated calcium entry (SOCE), JNK phosphorylation and a decrease in IFN-γ, IL-2 and TNF expression. The findings are novel and interesting and the paper is well-written and easy to follow. The data are convincing and adequately controlled. I support publication. Nevertheless, there are a few issues that the authors might wish to consider.</p></body></sub-article><sub-article article-type="reply" id="sa2"><front-stub><article-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.72559.sa2</article-id><title-group><article-title>Author response</article-title></title-group></front-stub><body><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Essential revisions:</p><p>The study, which is a first such analysis of CRACR2A in a patient, is an important advance understanding of this proteins function in the regulation of CRAC channels in T-cells.

Based on our more than a decade of experience in SOCE measurements with primary human/mouse T cells and cell lines including Jurkat T cells, we have observed minimal changes in Ca<sup>2+</sup> entry upon exchange of 0 or 2- mM Ca<sup>2+</sup>-containing solution, unless there is a stimulus present (like thapsigargin or anti-CD3 ab crosslinking or a Ca<sup>2+</sup>-dependent mutant expression in the cells). Accordingly, when we present the bar graphs (Figures 4D/E and 6A/B), we subtract the baseline (average readings in 2 mM Ca<sup>2+</sup>-containing solution, prior to addition of any stimulus) and present the data as “Peak-basal (ratio)”. We include a figure from one of our papers (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="sa2fig1">Author response image 1</xref>, from Figure 2 of PMID: 22586105) where we show the same in primary murine T cells. When we compare steady state ratios at the beginning of the experiment in 2 mM Ca<sup>2+</sup>-containing solution (time 100 s) and the end after exchange with Ca<sup>2+</sup> free solution (time 900 s), there is minimal change in ratio values, as seen by the black line.

The new data presented in Figure 4D of the revised manuscript shows reduced peak as well as sustained levels after anti-CD3 antibody treatment in patient cells. Further this reduction is sustained even after ionomycin treatment. These data were further verified by measuring SOCE using a different agonist – thapsigargin, which inhibits the SERCA pump to passively deplete the ER Ca<sup>2+</sup> stores and thereby activate SOCE. As shown in representative traces in Figure 4E of the revised manuscript, the patient cells show similar levels of ER Ca<sup>2+</sup> stores (area under curve in the presence of thapsigargin in Ca<sup>2+</sup>-free solution), however SOCE is reduced after re-introduction of 2 mM Ca<sup>2+</sup>-containing Ringers solution. Further, in our previous studies, we have shown that CRACR2A is important for both Ca<sup>2+</sup> entry triggered by anti-CD3 Ab cross-linking and passive ER Ca<sup>2+</sup> store depletion by treatment with thapsigargin or ionomycin (PMID: 27016526). In this manuscript, we also show these results in Figure 6A and B, using Jurkat T cells deleted for endogenous CRACR2A. Taken together, using either thapsigargin, anti-CD3-crosslinking or ionomycin stimuli, we can see reduced SOCE in either patient cells or Jurkat T cells deleted for endogenous CRACR2A.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>3.

These have now been included into the Table 1. The evaluation in February of 2021 showed % of T regs to be 2.9 whilst the repeat measurement in November showed % of Tregs to be 3.5, which is just above the lower end of the normal reference range provided by the reviewer. Overall, the patient has detectable T regs, albeit at the lower end or just below the normal range. One likely explanation for this observation is the patient’s poor IL-2 response/production, which is particularly important for Treg development and maintenance.

However, considering the lack of any autoimmune/inflammatory or lymphoproliferative complications, the apparent partial reduction in T regs is unlikely to be clinically relevant in this case.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>5. Table 1: Analysis of patients with deficits in STIM and Orai have revealed differences in T-regulatory, TH1 and TH17 subset dependencies on CRAC function (reported in Fuchs et al., J Immunol 2012; Feske et al. Nature 2006; McCarl et al. J. Allergy Clin. Immunol.2009; amongst others). Can the authors comment on these subsets based on the data shown in Table 1? It would be helpful if the authors position the observations made in the patient T-cells, in the context of earlier reports on STIM and Orai loss-of-function analysis in human T-cells.</p></disp-quote><p>In the case of our CRACR2A deficient patient we have shown that patient’s T cells have significantly reduced capacity to produce IFNγ, IL-2 and TNF when compared to healthy controls (Figure 4A-C). This is similar to what has previously been shown in patients with STIM1 and ORA1 deficiencies. We did not specifically investigate IL-4 or IL-17 production by the T cells. Nevertheless, we performed additional phenotyping experiments to determine the ratio of TH1/TH2 and TH17 T cells in the peripheral blood. We did not find any significant differences between the patient and healthy controls, although the proportion of the patient derived TH2 cells seemed reduced in comparison with controls (see Suppl Figure 1). However, the method we used to determine the TH1/TH2 and TH17 ratios in the peripheral blood relies on the expression of surface chemokine receptors rather than cytokine production, therefore functionally these cells might still be impaired, as we have demonstrated for TH1 IFNγ producing subset.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>6. Figure 4: The protocol for Figure 4 may be better explained. In the legend, it is stated: &quot; PBMCs were stimulated with anti-CD3 and anti-CD28 antibodies for 48 hrs and cultured for further 4 days in the presence of IL-2 before re-stimulation with PMA plus ionomycin for 5 hrs for cytokine analysis&quot;. Why was such a prolonged stimulation used? Normally, the combination of ionomycin and PMA is sufficient. And the authors are culturing for 4 days with IL-2 and then measuring IL-2 after stimulation with ionomycin/PMA for 5 hours.</p></disp-quote><p>PBMCs were stimulated with anti-CD3 and anti-CD28 antibodies to induce their differentiation and proliferation. After first 48 hours of stimulation, cells were detached from the antibody-coated plates and expanded with IL-2. After 4 days of expansion, effector T cells were acutely re-stimulated with PMA and ionomycin treatment for 5 h to check cytokine levels. Since we wash away IL-2 before re-simulation and check IL-2 using intracellular staining, addition of IL-2 during the expansion does not influence data interpretation. These methods have been better explained in the methods section of the revised manuscript.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>7. The KO group is missing in panel 5C.</p></disp-quote><p>Panel 5C examines a possible dominant negative effect of mutants of CRACR2A in the presence of endogenous WT CRACR2A protein. Hence, these experiments cannot be done in KO cells. Reconstitution efficiency of mutant CRACR2A proteins is shown in KO cells in Figures 5A and 5B.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>8. There is a very small difference between the calcium signals (peak and plateau) between KO+ WT and KO+DM (Figure 6B), yet the difference between these two groups on cytokine production (Figure 5) is considerably larger. This could be explained by the fact that the measurements in Figure 6 are bulk calcium recordings, whereas it is local calcium signals near Orai1 channels that drive the cytokine responses in Figure 5 through NFAT activation (e.g. papers by Kar et al.).</p></disp-quote><p>Thank You for pointing this out. Of course, one of the mechanisms can be local Ca<sup>2+</sup> concentration in microdomains of CRAC channels that mediate NFAT translocation. We will need to use advanced microscopy techniques including TIRF microscopy to ascertain that. This aspect will form a part of future studies of this project.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>9. Immunoprecipitation analysis in Figure 7 shows that CRACR2A can interact with Orai1 and STIM1. Were these experiments done under resting conditions or after stimulation?</p></disp-quote><p>Immunoprecipitation experiments were done purely to check binding between the proteins when overexpressed in HEK293T cells, hence there was no stimulation involved.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>10. Have levels of STIM 1 and Orai (Orai1) proteins, been assessed in the patient T-cells? Is STIM1 translocation/puncta formation compromised by the CRACR2A mutants? This can be shown easily by expressing a tagged-STIM1 (e.g. STIM1-YFP).</p></disp-quote><p>In the revised manuscript, we include experiments to check protein and transcripts of ORAI1 and STIM1 in patient cells. As seen in newly added supplementary figure 2, protein and transcript expression of <italic>ORAI1</italic> and <italic>STIM1</italic> is similar in patient cells as compared to representative healthy controls. As previously published, overexpression of tagged WT STIM1 can often rescue the defects observed in CRACR2A KO cells, due to compensatory effects, hence we cannot use that system for detection of STIM1 translocation to puncta in patient cells.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Additional comments:</p><p>1. Could the authors comment on the mechanisms underpinning progressive loss of T-cells observed in the donor? An analysis of T-cell exhaustion markers; CD95 mediated apoptosis or anti-CD3 induced activation induced death in patient cells would be informative. Alternatively, does the expression of CRAC2A mutant proteins in the T-cell line affect the signalling to apoptosis? Along the same lines, can the authors comment if blunted proliferation in response to PMA + Ionomycin (Figure 1D) or x-linking CD3 associated with increased cell death of donor CD4<sup>+</sup> T-cells?</p></disp-quote><p>Thank You for providing an interesting suggestion. This finding is unique for human T cells as <italic>Cracr2a<sup>fl/fl</sup> Cd4</italic>-cre mice do not show significant reduction in CD4<sup>+</sup> cell numbers (Woo JS et al., Journal of Immunology, 2018, PMID 29987160). However, while humans are constantly exposed to pathogens and diverse microbiota, <italic>Cracr2a<sup>fl/fl</sup> Cd4</italic>-cre mice are housed in a specific pathogen-free facility with limited microbiota, suggesting that the reduced number of CD4<sup>+</sup> cells in P1 may be indeed derived from defects in TCR signaling, which plays a crucial role in T cell homeostasis, survival, and death. Although we completely agree with the reviewer’s opinion, it is currently hard to check this idea due to limited availability of patient cells. In the future, we plan to check detailed T cell responses to cell death using knockout mice after in vivo stimulation with anti-CD3 antibody injection by checking CD95 and other extrinsic and intrinsic T cell death mechanisms.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>2. The manuscript would be strengthened by inclusion of direct recordings of SOCE current using the whole cell patch clamp and showing that the CRAC current is reduced when the various CRACR2A mutants are present. However, this is not vital to the conclusions drawn.</p></disp-quote><p>Thank You for this suggestion. It is technically very challenging to measure endogenous CRAC currents in wild type Jurkat T cells. Deciphering differences in current densities in CRACR2A KO Jurkat T cells expressing various mutants of CRACR2A may not yield significant results, mainly due to very low signal to noise ratio in those measurements.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>3. This is one of the first reports of a SCID associated with aberrant SOCE that does not arise from mutation in either STIM or Orai1 genes. Mutations in STIM1 or Orai1 often evoke non-immunological effects including muscular hypotonia, defective enamel production and anhidrosis, all of which are believed to be a consequence of the loss of SOCE. It would be interesting to know whether the patient in this study exhibited similar phenotypes.</p></disp-quote><p>The patient did not exhibit any non-immunological features that are typically seen in STIM1 or ORAI1 deficiencies. This information has now been added to the results (page 4) of the revised manuscript.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>4. Abstract. In the sentence, &quot;The patient exhibited late onset combined immunodeficiency characterised by recurrent chest infections, panhypogammaglobulinemia and CD4<sup>+</sup> T cell lymphopenia.&quot; I would recommend to add current age, gender, ethnicity and his full mutation.</p></disp-quote><p>These details have now been added to the abstract.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>5.

Is there any changes in patient's weight and/height during all period of observation?</p></disp-quote><p>Chronic diarrhea resolved after the patient was commenced on immunoglobulin replacement therapy. We did not find an obvious explanation for his diarrhea. The diarrhea could have been a consequence of immuno-dysregulation resulting from the profound panhypogammaglobulinemia. This phenomenon is observed frequently in clinical practice, whereby different inflammatory and autoimmune complications, including inflammatory bowel manifestations are corrected following institution of the immunoglobulin replacement. We have added a sentence in the results (page 5) of the revised manuscript to update the patient status related to the chronic diarrhoea: “His chronic diarrhoea resolved following commencement of IVIG and the ongoing treatment with IVIG has resulted in excellent control of respiratory infections.”</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>6. P.5 line 12-14. &quot;Interestingly, biopsy of his large bowel, which was performed in 2011 for investigation of intermittent diarrhoea, showed mild non-specific inflammatory changes, but also absence of the plasma cells.&quot; Any other data from bowel biopsy?

The discussion may include a comment on what group/table of PID classification this new disease may be included in: Humoral? Combined? Immune-dysregulation?
