concentration gradient between membrane leaflets. ANO6/TMEM16F has been shown to be essential for Ca<sup>2+</sup>-dependent PLS, but controversy surrounds whether ANO6 is a phospholipid scramblase or an ion channel like other ANO/TMEM16 family members. Combining patch clamp recording with measurement of PLS, we show that ANO6 elicits robust Ca<sup>2+</sup>-dependent PLS coinciding with ionic currents that are explained by ionic leak during phospholipid translocation. By analyzing ANO1-ANO6 chimeric proteins, we identify a domain in ANO6 necessary for PLS and sufficient to confer this function on ANO1, which normally does not scramble. Homology modeling shows that the scramblase domain forms an unusual hydrophilic cleft that faces the lipid bilayer and may function to facilitate translocation of phospholipid between membrane leaflets. These findings provide a mechanistic framework for understanding PLS and how ANO6 functions in this process.</p><p><bold>DOI:</bold> <ext-link ext-link-type="doi" xlink:href="10.7554/eLife.06901.001">http://dx.doi.org/10.7554/eLife.06901.001</ext-link></p></abstract><abstract abstract-type="executive-summary"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.06901.002</object-id><title>eLife digest</title><p>Cell membranes are made of two layers of molecules called phospholipids. The types of phospholipid molecules in the outer layer are often different from those in the inner layer. This asymmetry is an important feature of most membranes, but cells also have proteins called ‘scramblases’ that can move (or scramble) the phospholipids between the two layers. This scrambling process often marks a cell for destruction but also plays a key role in many activities throughout the body including cell–cell fusion, blood clotting, autoimmune diseases and inflammation.</p><p>Previous research revealed that a membrane protein called ANO6 is needed for some kinds of phospholipid scrambling. Other proteins that are most closely related to ANO6 are not phospholipid scramblases; instead they are channel proteins that allow ions to pass across cell membranes. ANO6 can also allow ions to flow across membranes, which raised the question: is ANO6 actually a scramblase itself, or does it control other proteins with scramblase activity?</p><p>Yu, Whitlock et al. addressed this question by engineering human cells grown in the laboratory to produce the ANO6 protein, and found that these cells had high levels of phospholipid scrambling. Next, the scrambling of phospholipids in these cells was measured while the flow of ions through ANO6 was also recorded. These experiments revealed that these two processes happened almost simultaneously. Yu, Whitlock et al. suggest that this could mean that ANO6 allows ions to leak through when it shuttles phospholipids between layers of cell membranes.</p><p>ANO1 is an ion channel that is related to ANO6 but it does not have scramblase activity. By designing and testing hybrid proteins that combined parts of ANO6 and ANO1, Yu, Whitlock et al. identified the part of ANO6 that is responsible for its scramblase activity. Furthermore, computer models of this ‘scrambling domain’ suggest that it forms an unusual groove that faces into the cell membrane, and that could help phospholipids to shuttle between the inner and outer layers of the membrane. Alternatively, this groove could interact with other proteins to regulate phospholipid scrambling; and if so, further work will be needed to identify these unknown proteins.</p><p>Finally, swapping a relatively small number of features between ANO6 and ANO1 could confer scrambling activity on ANO1. This suggests that ANO1 may itself have a special relationship to membrane phospholipids. Uncovering the nature of this relationship, if it exists, as well as understanding how ANO6 scrambles phospholipids will challenge structural biologists to generate high-resolution images of these proteins in complex with phospholipids.</p><p><bold>DOI:</bold> <ext-link ext-link-type="doi" xlink:href="10.7554/eLife.06901.002">http://dx.doi.org/10.7554/eLife.06901.002</ext-link></p></abstract><kwd-group kwd-group-type="author-keywords"><title>Author keywords</title><kwd>phospholipid</kwd><kwd>chloride channel</kwd><kwd>membrane transport</kwd><kwd>membrane channel</kwd><kwd>anion channel</kwd></kwd-group><kwd-group kwd-group-type="research-organism"><title>Research organism</title><kwd>Human</kwd><kwd>Mouse</kwd></kwd-group><funding-group><award-group id="par-1"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000002</institution-id><institution>National Institutes of Health (NIH)</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>GM60448-12</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Hartzell</surname><given-names>H Criss</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="par-2"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000002</institution-id><institution>National Institutes of Health (NIH)</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>EY114852-11</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Hartzell</surname><given-names>H Criss</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="par-3"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000002</institution-id><institution>National Institutes of Health (NIH)</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>5T32GM008367-25</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Whitlock</surname><given-names>Jarred M</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><funding-statement>The funder had no role in study design, data collection and interpretation, or the decision to submit the work for publication.</funding-statement></funding-group><custom-meta-group><custom-meta><meta-name>elife-xml-version</meta-name><meta-value>2.3</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta specific-use="meta-only"><meta-name>Author impact statement</meta-name><meta-value>The amino acids that are necessary for phospholipid scrambling by ANO6/TMEM16F can, via domain swapping, confer scrambling activity to the chloride ion channel ANO1 that normally does not scramble phospholipids.</meta-value></custom-meta></custom-meta-group></article-meta></front><body><sec id="s1" sec-type="intro"><title>Introduction</title><p>The transbilayer asymmetric distribution of phospholipids in cell membranes is evolutionarily conserved and essential to cellular physiology. In eukaryotic plasma membranes, the outer leaflet is enriched in phosphatidylcholine and sphingomyelin and the inner cytoplasmic-facing leaflet is rich in phosphatidylserine (PtdSer) and phosphatidylethanolamine (PtdEtn) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Bretscher, 1972</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Fadeel and Xue, 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib51">Lhermusier et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib91">van Meer, 2011</xref>). This asymmetry is established by ATP-dependent lipid flippases, most notably members of the P4 ATPase family (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib64">Panatala et al., 2015</xref>) and ABC transporters (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Borst et al., 2000</xref>), that actively transport phospholipids to one leaflet of the membrane and are important in membrane biogenesis. Phospholipid asymmetry plays critical roles in membrane function in two ways. (1) Charges on the phospholipid head groups bind and regulate protein function. The best known examples may be the effects of phosphatidylinositol bisphosphate on ion channel proteins (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib82">Suh and Hille, 2008</xref>), but PtdSer and PtdEtn play equally important roles (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Fairn et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib41">Jeong and Conboy, 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib46">Kay and Grinstein, 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">Hosseini et al., 2014</xref>). (2) The different molecular shapes (e.g., cylindrical or conical) of various lipids determine membrane curvature which is key to membrane trafficking and fusion (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Graham and Kozlov, 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Bigay and Antonny, 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib96">Xu et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib81">Suetsugu et al., 2014</xref>).</p><p>In opposition to ATP-dependent flippases, ATP-independent phospholipid scramblases (PLSases) facilitate the equilibration of phospholipid distribution between the two membrane leaflets. PLSases play essential roles in the synthesis of glycoconjugates, such as N-glycosylated proteins and GPI-anchored proteins in the endoplasmic reticulum (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib67">Pomorski and Menon, 2006</xref>). Moreover, at the plasma membrane dissipation of phospholipid asymmetry by phospholipid scrambling (PLS) is a common cell signaling mechanism (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Fadeel and Xue, 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Bevers and Williamson, 2010</xref>). For example, exposure of PtdSer on the external leaflet of the plasma membrane marks apoptotic cells for phagocytosis by macrophages and plays a key role in blood clotting (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Fadok et al., 1992</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib92">Verhoven et al., 1995</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Emoto et al., 1997</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Fadok et al., 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib86">Suzuki et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib51">Lhermusier et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib46">Kay and Grinstein, 2013</xref>). PtdSer exposure that occurs when platelets sense tissue damage serves as a catalytic surface for assembly of plasma-borne coagulation factors and a &gt;10<sup>6</sup>-fold increase in the rate of thrombin formation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib102">Zwaal et al., 1998</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib72">Sahu et al., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib47">Kay et al., 2012</xref>). PtdSer exposure also plays important roles in developmental processes that involve fusion of mononucleated progenitor cells to form multinucleated cells such as skeletal muscle (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib41">Jeong and Conboy, 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">Hochreiter-Hufford et al., 2013</xref>), osteoclasts (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib63">Pajcini et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">Helming and Gordon, 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">Harre et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib78">Shin et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib93">Verma et al., 2014</xref>) and placental syncytiotrophoblasts (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib40">Huppertz et al., 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib70">Riddell et al., 2013</xref>).</p><p>In the simplest conceptualization, PLS is mediated by PLSases that are thought to provide, in a manner analogous to ion channels, an aqueous pathway for the hydrophilic phospholipid head groups to flip between the inner and outer leaflets (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib67">Pomorski and Menon, 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib73">Sanyal and Menon, 2009</xref>). However, the molecular mechanisms of PLS have remained elusive partly because PLS can be catalyzed by a variety of unrelated proteins. PLS is stimulated by two pathways, a rapid one triggered by increases in intracellular [Ca<sup>2+</sup>] and a slow caspase-dependent pathway associated with apoptosis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib74">Schoenwaelder et al., 2009</xref>). At least four different families of proteins have been implicated in PLS (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib72">Sahu et al., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Bevers and Williamson, 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib51">Lhermusier et al., 2011</xref>). The first putative PLSases (PLSCR1–PLSCR4) were identified by their ability to stimulate Ca<sup>2+</sup>-dependent PtdSer scrambling when incorporated into liposomes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Basse et al., 1996</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Comfurius et al., 1996</xref>), but the role of PLSCRs in PLS is controversial because these proteins are small calmodulin-like molecules whose disruption in mice, flies, and worms has little effect on PLS (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Acharya et al., 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Fadeel and Xue, 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Bevers and Williamson, 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib62">Ory et al., 2013</xref>). More recently, the Xk-family protein Xkr8 has been shown to be necessary for caspase-dependent PtdSer scrambling that can be rescued by multiple Xkr8 paralogs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib83">Suzuki et al., 2013a</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib85">2014</xref>). Unexpectedly, several G-protein coupled receptors including rhodopsin and the β-adrenergic receptor have also been shown to elicit PLS (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Goren et al., 2014</xref>). Although lipid-translocating ABC transporters and phospholipid synthesis may also play roles in PLS, these processes cannot fully explain PLS (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Fadeel and Xue, 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Goren et al., 2014</xref>).</p><p>Recently, it has been suggested that some members of the 10-gene Anoctamin (TMEM16) family are PLSases. Evidence supporting a role for ANO6 in PLS includes the findings that (a) mutations in ANO6 produce Scott Syndrome, a blood clotting disorder where platelets fail to expose PtdSer in response to cytosolic Ca<sup>2+</sup> increases (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib86">Suzuki et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib98">Yang et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib49">Kmit et al., 2013</xref>), (b) knockout of ANO6 in mice abolishes the ability of cells to expose PtdSer and to scramble other lipid species in response to elevated cytosolic Ca<sup>2+</sup> while PLS stimulated by the apoptotic Fas receptor is unaffected (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib86">Suzuki et al., 2010</xref>), and (c) over-expression of ANO6 in knockout cells rescues PLS (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib84">Suzuki et al., 2013b</xref>). However, the suggestion that ANO6 is a PLSase is confounded by the fact that other members of the anoctamin family, ANO1 and ANO2, encode the pore-forming subunits of Ca<sup>2+</sup>-activated Cl<sup>−</sup> channels (CaCCs) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Caputo et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib75">Schroeder et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib99">Yang et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Hartzell et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Duran and Hartzell, 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib65">Pedemonte and Galietta, 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib71">Ruppersburg and Hartzell, 2014</xref>). It was initially presumed that all ANOs are Cl<sup>−</sup> channels because of the close sequence similarity between ANO family members (ANO1 is 38–45% identical to ANOs −3 to −7, &gt;90% coverage), however, the requirement of ANO6 for Ca<sup>2+</sup>-dependent PLS and the ability of ANOs 3, 4, 6, 7, and 9 to rescue this activity suggests functional divergence within the ANO family (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib86">Suzuki et al., 2010</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib84">2013b</xref>).</p><p>Questions remain whether ANO6 is a PLSase itself and/or is an ion channel that regulates PLSase activity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib50">Kunzelmann et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib65">Pedemonte and Galietta, 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib66">Picollo et al., 2015</xref>). ANO6 has been reported to be a non-selective cation channel (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib97">Yang et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Adomaviciene et al., 2013</xref>), a swelling-activated Cl<sup>−</sup> channel (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Almaca et al., 2009</xref>), an outwardly-rectifying Cl<sup>−</sup> channel (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib57">Martins et al., 2011</xref>), a CaCC (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib87">Szteyn et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib77">Shimizu et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib43">Juul et al., 2014</xref>), and a CaCC of delayed activation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Grubb et al., 2013</xref>). Furthermore, in contrast to <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib86">Suzuki et al. (2010)</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib98">Yang et al. (2012)</xref> conclude that ANO6 is a regulator of an endogenous PLSase because they find that expression of ANO6 in HEK cells does not cause PtdSer exposure. However, the suggestion that some ANOs are PLSases and are not simply regulators of endogenous PLSases is supported by recent reports that two fungal ANO homologs purified and incorporated into liposomes mediate Ca<sup>2+</sup>-stimulated PLS (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib55">Malvezzi et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Brunner et al., 2014</xref>).</p><p>Here we address three questions. (1) Does expression of ANO6 stimulate Ca<sup>2+</sup>-dependent PLS in HEK cells? We find that ANO6 expression in HEK cells induces robust Ca<sup>2+</sup>-activated scramblase activity. (2) Is the ion channel activity of ANO6 related to PLS? We find that ANO6 currents are non-selective among ions and are activated simultaneously with PLS. This suggests that ionic currents are a consequence of phospholipid translocation. Chimeric constructs that exhibit PLS also exhibit simultaneous non-selective currents. Furthermore, we find that drugs that block ANO1 currents do not block ANO6 currents or PLS. This is consistent with the idea that the ion conduction pathway associated with ANO6 is unlike the ANO1 pore. (3) What are the domains of ANO6 that are required for PLS? We find that mutating several amino acids in ANO6 between TMD4 and TMD5 eliminates both PLS and ion channel activity. Furthermore, replacing as few as 15 amino acids in ANO1 in the TMD4-TMD5 region with ANO6 sequence confers robust PLS activity on ANO1, which normally does not elicit PLS activity.</p></sec><sec id="s2" sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><sec id="s2-1"><title>ANO6 expression induces robust PLS in HEK cells</title><p>We first asked whether ANO6 when expressed heterologously induced PLS in HEK293 cells. Ca<sup>2+</sup>-dependent PtdSer exposure on the outer leaflet of the plasma membrane was measured by confocal imaging of two PtdSer probes, either LactoglobulinC2 fused to Clover fluorescent protein (‘LactC2’) or Annexin-V conjugated to AlexaFluor-568 (‘Annexin-V’) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib76">Shi et al., 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">Hou et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib45">Kay and Grinstein, 2011</xref>). Our initial experiments employed LactC2 with a clonal cell line stably transfected with mANO6-FLAG<sub>3X</sub>. 100% of the cells express ANO6-FLAG<sub>3X</sub> as shown by staining with anti-FLAG antibody (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1A</xref>). Intracellular Ca<sup>2+</sup> was elevated by incubation of the cells in 10 µM A23187 in nominally zero Ca<sup>2+</sup> solution followed by washout of A23187 and addition of 5 mM Ca<sup>2+</sup> to initiate Ca<sup>2+</sup>-dependent PLS. 12 min after adding Ca<sup>2+</sup>, ∼92% of the cells (N = 404) showed LactC2 binding to the surface (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1B,G</xref>). In contrast, little or no LactC2 binding was seen in the parental cell line (0.2% positive cells, N = 724) or in ANO1-FLAG<sub>3X</sub>-expressing cells (8% positive cells, N = 316) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1C,D,G</xref>). The difference in PLS observed with ANO1 and ANO6 expressing cells was not explained by differences in expression as shown by western blot (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1F</xref>). These data show clearly that ANO6 expression facilitates PLS. However, the finding that a small fraction (8%) of ANO6-FLAG<sub>3X</sub> expressing cells do not exhibit PLS raises the possibility that ANO6 may not be sufficient for PLS and may require additional components.<fig id="fig1" position="float"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.06901.003</object-id><label>Figure 1.</label><caption><title>Expression of ANO6 in HEK cells stimulates Ca<sup>2+</sup>-dependent phospholipid scrambling (PLS).</title><p>(<bold>A</bold>) Images of HEK cells stably transfected with ANO6-FLAG<sub>3X</sub> fixed and stained with anti-FLAG (green) and phalloidin (magenta).

ANO6-FLAG<sub>3X</sub> cells exposed to A23187 without addition of Ca<sup>2+</sup> exhibited no detectible LactC2 binding over 15 min, whereas subsequent addition of Ca<sup>2+</sup> stimulated robust LactC2 binding (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1E</xref>).</p><p>Next, we compared LactC2 and Annexin-V as probes for PLS. The percentage of cells stained with Annexin-V and LactC2 were the same, however, the kinetics of binding of the two probes were markedly different. After elevating cytosolic Ca<sup>2+</sup>, Annexin-V fluorescence increased mono-exponentially with a mean τ = 143 s (7 separate experiments, χ<sup>2</sup> of fit = 0.03) and approached a plateau within less than 10 min (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1H</xref>). In contrast, the time course of LactC2 binding was significantly slower (5 separate experiments, τ = 433 s, χ<sup>2</sup> of fit = 0.02). LactC2 binding exhibited a lag period of 1–2 min before binding was detectable. One potential explanation of the difference in Annexin-V and LactC2 time courses may be related to the fact that LactC2 prefers binding to oxidized PtdSer (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib90">Tyurin et al., 2008</xref>). Because Annexin-V binds with more rapid kinetics, the rest of the experiments shown here were performed using Annexin-V.</p><p>Because all of the cells in the clonal cell line express ANO6-FLAG<sub>3X</sub> at about the same level, we turned to a polyclonal cell line stably expressing ANO6-EGFP to evaluate the relationship of ANO6 expression to the rate and extent of Annexin-V binding (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2</xref>). In the polyclonal line, ANO6-EGFP expression level was variable and 85% of ANO6-EGFP cells exhibited PLS (N = 180). This percentage may be lower than the ANO6-FLAG<sub>3X</sub> clonal line because some ANO6-EGFP positive cells may have lower expression than the ANO6-FLAG<sub>3X</sub> cells. There was a direct relationship between the level of ANO6-EGFP expression and the level of Annexin-V binding 10 min after elevating cytosolic Ca<sup>2+</sup> (Pearson correlation coefficient = 0.84) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2C</xref>), however there was considerable variation around the fitted relationship, with some highly-expressing ANO6 cells showing little Annexin-V binding and low-expressing cells showing high levels of binding. The rate of Annexin-V binding was similar among cells (τ in this experiment ranged from 152–229 s), but the plateau level of Annexin-V binding attained after 12 min varied markedly among cells. Neither the rate nor the plateau level of binding correlated with the level of ANO6-EGFP fluorescence. This lack of correlation may reflect an inability to distinguish between ANO6-EGFP located on vs adjacent to the plasma membrane or may reflect heterogeneity in the expression of other components required for PLS.<fig id="fig2" position="float"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.06901.004</object-id><label>Figure 2.</label><caption><title>Characteristics of PLS linked to ANO6.</title><p>Intracellular Ca<sup>2+</sup> was elevated by A23187, as in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1</xref>, in polyclonal lines of HEK cells expressing (<bold>A</bold>) ANO1-EGFP or (<bold>B</bold>) ANO6-EGFP.

After establishing whole-cell recording, the time course of activation of membrane currents in ANO6-expressing cells was very slow even when the patch pipet solution contained high (200 μM) Ca<sup>2+</sup>. The currents typically began to increase 8 min after initiating whole cell recording, which is similar to that reported by others (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Grubb et al., 2013</xref>). Annexin-V binding usually became detectable 2–3 min later (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3B,C</xref>). The time courses of ANO6 current activation and Annexin-V binding were fit to the equation y = A2 + (A1 − A2)/1 + exp[(t − t<sub>0</sub>)/τ]. Although the time constants of the increases in Annexin-V binding (τ = 2.24 ± 0.15 min) and ANO6 current (τ = 2.31 ± 0.34 min) were the same, the time (t<sub>0</sub>) at which Annexin-V fluorescence reached half of its maximal value [(A1 + A2)/2] was delayed 3 min relative to the current.

One possibility is that current is required for PLS. However, we believe that the lag is partly explained by inherent differences in way the two events are measured. Patch clamp recording measures membrane conductance instantaneously, while detection of Annexin-V fluorescence requires the accumulation of Annexin-V on the membrane that is limited by its binding kinetics and the sensitivity of the fluorescence detection. Because Annexin binding to model bilayers is known to be slow and requires a threshold PtdSer concentration (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib44">Kastl et al., 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib76">Shi et al., 2006</xref>) and the numerical aperture of the microscope objective was 0.6, we believe that currents and PLS occur contemporaneously. This correlation suggested the possibility that currents reflect transmembrane ion leakage associated with the process of phospholipid transport. The alternative hypothesis that ionic current through ANO6 somehow activates PLS is excluded by the finding that PLS occurs normally in ANO6-expressing cells under conditions where there is no ionic current (e.g., cells voltage-clamped at 0 mV with identical intracellular and extracellular solutions where E<sub>rev</sub> for every ion is 0 mV).</p></sec><sec id="s2-3"><title>ANO6 current and PLS require the same Ca<sup>2+</sup> concentration for activation</title><p>If ANO6 current is a consequence of PLS and not a separate function of the protein, we would expect that current and PLS would require the same Ca<sup>2+</sup> concentration for activation.

If ANO6 currents are a consequence of PLS, we would predict that their ionic selectivity would be very low. To explore the idea that ANO6 currents are essentially leak currents, we examined the ionic selectivity of the currents appearing after PLS was activated. In comparison to ANO1 currents, which exhibit robust anion:cation selectivity (P<sub>Na</sub>/P<sub>Cl</sub> = 0.03), the ANO6 current is highly non-selective (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5</xref>). The ionic selectivity sequence was Na<sup>+</sup> &gt; Cl<sup>−</sup> &gt; Cs<sup>+</sup> &gt; NMDG<sup>+</sup> (P<sub>Na</sub>/P<sub>Cl</sub> = 1.38, P<sub>Cs</sub>/P<sub>Cl</sub> = 0.6, P<sub>NMDG</sub>/P<sub>Cl</sub> = 0.48). These data are consistent with the permeation pathway of ANO6 being relatively large and capable of passing NMDG<sup>+</sup> which has a mean diameter of ∼7.3 Å. The finding that ANO6 currents have very low ionic selectivity and are activated contemporaneously with PLS over the same Ca<sup>2+</sup> concentration range suggested that PLS and currents have the same underlying mechanism.<fig id="fig5" position="float"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.06901.007</object-id><label>Figure 5.</label><caption><title>Ionic selectivity of ANO6 currents.</title><p>Representative whole-cell patch-clamp recordings and current–voltage relationships from (<bold>A</bold>) ANO6 and (<bold>B</bold>) ANO1 expressing cells with 200 μM [Ca<sup>2+</sup>]<sub>i</sub>.

We employed computational approaches to gain insights into sequence differences that could define this functional difference. We analyzed Type-I and Type-II divergence between mammalian ANO1 and ANO6 as an indication of the functional relevance of different amino acids (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Gu, 2006</xref>). Sequences used for the analysis are shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6s1">Figure 6—figure supplement 1</xref> and an alignment of ANO6 and ANO1 is shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6s2">Figure 6—figure supplement 2</xref>. Type I divergence occurs shortly after gene duplication and is characterized by amino acids that are highly conserved in one paralogous group of proteins and highly divergent in the other. Type II divergence occurs later when specific functions undergo positive selection within a paralogous group, resulting in conserved changes in amino acid properties. Type II divergence is exemplified by alignment positions that are identical within paralogous groups but have amino acids with radically different properties between paralogous groups. There are three major regions of Type-II divergence between ANO1 and ANO 6 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6A</xref>). These regions are located in (a) intracellular loop 1, (b) TMD4 and TMD5 and the short intracellular loop between them, and (c) the C-terminus adjacent to the last transmembrane domain.

Because ANO6 does not exhibit such Ca<sup>2+</sup>-independent currents, we asked whether we could detect Ca<sup>2+</sup>-independent ANO1-like currents in 1-6-1_D554-K588 in zero Ca<sup>2+</sup>. Like ANO1, 1-6-1_D554-K588 exhibits Ca<sup>2+</sup>-independent currents at very positive potentials and these currents are blocked by MONNA (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8">Figure 8B</xref>, blue triangles). This current is Cl<sup>−</sup>-selective (P<sub>Cs</sub>:P<sub>Cl</sub> = 0.08) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8">Figure 8C</xref>). Thus, in zero Ca<sup>2+</sup> 1-6-1_D554-K588 currents resemble ANO1. However, after PLS has been activated by Ca<sup>2+</sup>, the current is not blocked by MONNA (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8">Figure 8B</xref>, red squares) and the current is &gt;fourfold less Cl<sup>−</sup>-selective (P<sub>Cs</sub>:P<sub>Cl</sub> = 0.39) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8">Figure 8D</xref>). These data suggest that as PLS develops in response to elevated intracellular Ca<sup>2+</sup>, the ionic conductance pathway changes from Cl<sup>−</sup>-selective to non-selective. In fact, this transition between MONNA-sensitive and MONNA-insensitive currents can be seen when MONNA is applied shortly after establishing whole-cell recording with Ca<sup>2+</sup> in the pipet (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8">Figure 8B</xref>, black open circles). The current is initially blocked partially by MONNA, but then the current begins to increase coincidently with development of PLS.</p><p>Because PLS of 1-6-1_D554-K588 develops quickly after establishing whole cell recording, it is difficult to compare the properties of the currents before and after PLS in the same cell. Therefore, we used the chimera 1-6-1_S532-G558 which activates PLS more slowly. About 5 min after establishing whole-cell recording before PLS was detectable, the current exhibited Cl<sup>−</sup>-selectivity as indicated by a 35 mV shift in E<sub>rev</sub> upon switching from 150 mM CsCl to 15 CsCl (P<sub>Cs</sub>:P<sub>Cl</sub> = 0.15) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8">Figure 8E</xref>).

We cannot formally determine whether the Cl<sup>−</sup>-selective pathway in the absence of PLS and the non-selective PLS-linked pathway are the same, but the observation that MONNA blocks the Cl<sup>−</sup>-selective pathway but has no effect on the current after PLS develops suggests that the Cl<sup>−</sup>-selective pathway is no longer present after PLS occurs. This is consistent with the Cl<sup>−</sup>-selective pathway becoming less selective during scrambling.</p></sec><sec id="s2-7"><title>Homology model of ANO6</title><p>Recently, the X-ray structure of an ANO homolog from the fungus <italic>Nectria haematococca</italic> was published (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Brunner et al., 2014</xref>).

It is important to note that despite the motivation to conclude that ANO6 is a PLSase based on its similarity in structure to nhTMEM16, it remains a possibility that ANO6 is a regulator of another protein that is the PLSase. Our finding that only about 92% of cells expressing ANO6 exhibit PLS suggests that ANO6 is not sufficient for PLS. Further, the lack of correlation between ANO6 expression levels and PLS activity supports some skepticism. One must only recall that PLSCR1 incorporated into liposomes mediates PLS but that knockout of its gene does not have clear-cut effects on PLS to appreciate a need for caution (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Acharya et al., 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Fadeel and Xue, 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Bevers and Williamson, 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib62">Ory et al., 2013</xref>).</p></sec><sec id="s3-3"><title>The ion conduction pathway</title><p>We propose that during scrambling ions pass through the same pathway that is occupied by the phospholipid. Ions might accompany the phospholipids as counterions or may simply flux independently through the same pathway. This suggestion is based on the observation that PLS and ionic currents activate contemporaneously and exhibit similar sensitivity to Ca<sup>2+</sup>. Furthermore, the presence of non-selective, slowly-activating currents that are insensitive to the ANO1 inhibitor MONNA correlate with the ability of chimeras to scramble. Some support for this idea is provided by cysteine mutagenesis and accessibility experiments showing that amino acids that we believe form the vestibule of the Cl<sup>−</sup> selective pore of ANO1 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib100">Yu et al., 2012</xref>) are located at the extracellular surface of the hydrophilic cleft (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig9s1">Figure 9—figure supplement 1</xref>).</p></sec><sec id="s3-4"><title>Evolution of the ANO/TMEM16 family</title><p>Our data add to the already growing awareness that the ANO family is functionally split with some of its members being anion-selective ion channels (ANO1 and ANO2) and other members having the ability to transport lipids between membrane leaflets. This functional duplicity is reminiscent of two other anion channels, CFTR and CLCs, which apparently evolved from transporters. CFTR (cystic fibrosis transmembrane conductance regulator) is a Cl<sup>−</sup> channel that evolved from ABC transporters (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Gadsby et al., 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib42">Jordan et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib60">Miller, 2010</xref>), and the CLC chloride channels CLC-1 and CLC-2 are members of a 9-gene family most of which are H<sup>+</sup>-Cl<sup>−</sup> exchangers (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib59">Miller, 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib52">Lisal and Maduke, 2008</xref>). Additionally, the P4 ATPases that function as lipid flippases evolved from a family of ion transporters (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Baldridge and Graham, 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib54">Lopez-Marques et al., 2014</xref>). One might speculate that the primordial ANO was a lipid transporter. During evolution, functional divergence likely occurred after gene duplication where the selective pressure for the major function (lipid transport) decreased, thus enabling the enhancement of the minor sub-function (ion transport). The finding that fungi have only one ANO gene, but that some fungal ANO homologs have PLS activity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib55">Malvezzi et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Brunner et al., 2014</xref>), supports the idea that PLS is an ancient function of ANOs. Our data suggest that the ionic currents carried by ANO6 are essentially flowing along with the scrambling lipids. Thus, the non-selective ion transport that occurs concomitantly with PLSase activity may have been a sub-function in the ancestral ANO. After gene duplication occurred, this sub-function may have evolved Cl<sup>−</sup> ion specificity.</p><p>ANOs that have evolved into anion channels may be more Cl<sup>−</sup> selective than the scrambling ANOs simply because the energy contour of the conduction pathway is altered by the absence of lipid substrate. Because Cl<sup>−</sup> is more hydrophobic than its cationic cousins, it may be more suited to traverse the evolutionary remnants of the phospholipid pathway. Consistent with this idea is the fact that, compared to many voltage-gated cation channels, Cl<sup>−</sup> channels are sadly non-selective: virtually all anions permeate and cations are often significantly permeable (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Duran et al., 2010</xref>). The pores of Cl<sup>−</sup> channels are often modeled as large viaducts that provide selectivity based largely on ionic hydration energies (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Dawson et al., 1999</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib69">Qu and Hartzell, 2000</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib53">Liu et al., 2003</xref>). This low selectivity is precisely what one might expect to evolve from a transporter that previously transported phospholipids. The finding that we can convert ANO1 into a protein capable of catalyzing PLS provides further support for this hypothesis for ANO1 evolution. Like the ClC family, where a single glutamic acid residue can determine whether a protein is a H<sup>+</sup>-Cl<sup>−</sup> transporter or a Cl<sup>−</sup> channel, here we show that a few amino acids can convert ANO1 into a protein that supports PLS activity. However, we have not yet been able to convert ANO6 into a Cl<sup>−</sup> selective ion channel. It is likely that additional changes outside the SCRD are required to confer Cl<sup>−</sup> selectivity. This may be also be explained by epistasis, where evolutionary trajectories are blocked by the accumulation of neutral mutations that have no impact on the initial function (non-selective ion transport) but prevent acquisition of the new function (Cl<sup>−</sup> selectivity) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Bridgham et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Breen et al., 2012</xref>). <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib97">Yang et al.

Perhaps a missing subunit or regulatory enzyme could activate its PLSase activity. Alternatively, the SCRD may hold a vital interaction site for another component essential for this process or possess a key site of posttranscriptional modification required for activating this activity. In any case, it is clear that ANO1 function is intimately dependent on phospholipids (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib88">Terashima et al., 2013</xref>) and understanding the relationships of the ANOs to membrane lipids is certain to be a major research goal for many laboratories in the coming years.</p></sec></sec><sec id="s4" sec-type="materials|methods"><title>Materials and methods</title><sec id="s4-1"><title>cDNAs</title><p>mANO1 (Uniprot Q8BHY3) and mANO6 (Uniprot Q6P9J9) tagged on the C-terminus with EGFP were provided by Dr Uhtaek Oh, Seoul National University.

Single cells identified by EGFP fluorescence were patch clamped ∼2 days after transfection. Transfected cells were identified on a Zeiss Axiovert microscope by EGFP fluorescence. Cells were voltage-clamped using conventional whole-cell patch-clamp techniques with an EPC-7 amplifier (HEKA, Germany). Fire-polished borosilicate glass patch pipettes were 3–5 MΩ. Experiments were conducted at ambient temperature (22–26°C). Because liquid junction potentials calculated using pClamp were predicted to be &lt;2 mV, no correction was made. The zero Ca<sup>2+</sup> pipet (intracellular) solution contained (mM): 146 CsCl, 2 MgCl<sub>2</sub>, 5 EGTA, 10 sucrose, 10 HEPES pH 7.3, adjusted with NMDG. The ∼20 μM Ca<sup>2+</sup> pipet solution contained 5 mM Ca<sup>2+</sup>-EGTA. The 0.2 mM Ca<sup>2+</sup> solution was made by adding additional 0.2 mM CaCl<sub>2</sub> to the 20 μM Ca<sup>2+</sup> pipet solution.

PLS was measured in populations of intact HEK293 cells grown on glass coverslips mounted in Attofluor chambers (Invitrogen, CA) and imaged at ambient temperature with a Zeiss confocal microscope using a 63× Plan-Aprochromat NA 1.4 objective. PtdSer exposure was measured by binding of Annexin-V-AlexaFluor-568 (543 nm excitation; 560 nm long pass emission) or LactC2-Clover (488 nm excitation, 500–530 nm band pass emission). The bath solution contained (mM) 140 NaCl, 10 CaCl<sub>2</sub>, 10 Tris-HCl pH 7.4. PLS was stimulated by elevation of intracellular Ca<sup>2+</sup> using the Ca<sup>2+</sup> ionophore A23187 (10 µM). The most reproducible PLS was obtained by incubation of cells 5 min in A23187 in nominally zero-Ca<sup>2+</sup> solution followed by washout of A23187 and addition of 5 mM Ca<sup>2+</sup> to initiate PLS. We presume that the A23187 exposure in zero Ca<sup>2+</sup> depletes internal stores and that the readdition of Ca<sup>2+</sup> results in store-operated Ca<sup>2+</sup> entry that is more rapid than Ca<sup>2+</sup> entry through A23187 channels alone. In some experiments, PLS was stimulated by exposure to A23187 and Ca<sup>2+</sup> simultaneously Sometimes SERCA inhibitors were included with no obvious effect. Scrambling was quantified by measuring the increase in Annexin-V fluorescence in EGFP-expressing cells by creating a binary mask from the EGFP channel for each Annexin-V-Alexa-568 frame in the time series using Fiji Image-J 1.49. The raw integrated density was then calculated by adding the intensity of all pixels in the unmasked area.</p><p>Binding of Annexin-V-AlexaFluor-568 to patch-clamped cells during voltage-clamp recording was imaged with a wide-field Zeiss Axiovert 100 microscope using a 40× NA 0.6 LD-Acroplan objective. Images were acquired with an Orca-FLASH 4.0 digital CMOS camera (C11440, Hamamatsu, Japan) controlled by Metamorph 7.8 software (Molecular Devices, CA). Annexin-V-AlexaFluor-568 was added to the normal extracellular solution before patch clamping the cell. After whole-cell recording was established with an intracellular solution containing either zero, 20 μM, or 200 μM free Ca<sup>2+</sup> the accumulation of Annexin-V on the plasma membrane was imaged at 1-min intervals synchronously with voltage clamp recording.</p></sec><sec id="s4-5"><title>Immunostaining and antibodies</title><p>Stable ANO6-FLAG<sub>3X</sub> cells were fixed on glass coverslips in 4% PFA for 10 min at room temperature, permeablized with 1.5% Tritonx-100 and stained with anti-FLAG M2 antibody (Sigma–Aldrich, MO) for two hours at room temperature. Coverslips were washed and stained with anti-mouse-Alexa-488 secondary and Alexa-633 conjugated phalloidin (1:1000, Molecular Probes, CA).

These two sequences share 23% identity and 37.4% similarly (calculated by the BLSM62 algorithm). A total of 12 gaps were introduced, primarily at the N- and C-termini and in loops between secondary structural elements. Secondary structure prediction was incorporated into the alignment for Phyre2 (and all of the other modeling servers used for comparison including Swiss-Model and Tasser). There are no gaps in or near the SCRD, with the nearest gaps located in extracellular loops between helices 3 and 4 (2 residue gap 24 residues away) and between helices 4 and 5 (1 residue gap 22 residues away). While overall alignment and homology model generation would benefit from a template with greater sequence identity, all modeling servers reported high confidence in the generated models with no variation in the placement of the SCRD between models. Model geometry was minimized and the model subjected to 500 steps of geometry idealization and energy minimization using Phenix (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Adams et al., 2010</xref>). The overall RMSD of Cα atoms in the final alignment was 1.485 Å with a Q-score of 0.667 (calculated by UCSF Chimera).</p></sec><sec id="s4-8"><title>Analysis of data</title><p>Electrophysiological traces were analyzed with Clampfit 9 (Molecular Devices, CA).

Your article has been favorably evaluated by Randy Schekman (Senior editor and Reviewing editor) and three outside reviewers.</p><p>The following individual responsible for the peer review of your submission have agreed to reveal their identity: Todd Graham and Anant Menon (peer reviewers). A further reviewer remains anonymous.</p><p>The Reviewing editor and the reviewers discussed their comments before we reached this decision, and the Reviewing editor has assembled the following comments to help you prepare a revised submission.</p><p>We agree that this work is important and for the most part a compelling case is made that ANO6 is indeed a phospholipid scramblase. This work certainly merits publication in <italic>eLife</italic> pending some additional work that is described in detail in the three referee reports appended below. However the reviewers have conferred and decided to focus your attention on four main points that must be satisfied to make this work publishable:</p><p>1) The authors should improve the annexin quantification and the correlation of its response with ANO6 expression.</p><p>2) The lag time between the ionic current and annexin binding can be explained by the non-linear response of annexin to PS density. A few experiments with Lactadherin, whose response to PS is more linear, could strengthen this part and validate the hypothesis that the ionic current is a consequence of the scramblase activity, not the other way round.</p><p>3) In the present state, the lipid docking predictions are not detailed enough to be convincing. The authors should provide more information or delete all this part.</p><p>4) In general, the paper would benefit from a major re-write to reduce jargon, and to state the problem and results clearly. Referencing would also benefit from a better appreciation of the lipid scrambling field.</p><p>There are also many other issues that you could address but the four above are the main ones that the reviewers consider essential.</p><p><italic>Reviewer #1:</italic></p><p>There are conflicting reports on whether ANO6/TMEM16F is a Ca<sup>2+</sup>-activated ion channel, a Ca<sup>2+</sup>-activated phospholipid scramblase, or both. There is also significant discrepancy in the literature on the ion selectivity of ANO6, and assuming it can directly scramble phospholipid, there is no clear understanding of how ANO6 mediates phospholipid transport while the closely related ANO1 clearly lacks scramblase activity. The submitted manuscript provides evidence that ANO6 primarily functions as a phospholipid scramblase and that ion permeation through the channel is a consequence of phospholipid translocation.</p><p>Part of the significance of this work is that it potentially clarifies the relationship between the ion channel and scramblase activities of ANO6. A second, major point of significance is that the authors help define the mechanism of phospholipid scrambling by mapping the region of the TM domain that is responsible for this activity. By transplanting a small section of the 4th and 5th transmembrane segments of ANO6 into ANO1, they conferred upon ANO1 the ability to induce Ca<sup>2+</sup>-dependent phospholipid scrambling in transfected cells. Within a homology model, this region maps to a hydrophilic cleft in the membrane domain that appears to be the ion permeation route in ANO1, but can be molded into a phospholipid transporter by exchange of a few amino acids. These observations provide the first mechanistic insight into how substrate specificity of the ANO/TMEM16 family of proteins is determined.</p><p>There are a few weaknesses in the presentation of the data that modestly detracts from my enthusiasm for the work.</p><p>Primary concerns:</p><p>1) A trivial explanation for the difference in scramblase activity for GFP-ANO1 and GFP-ANO6 shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1</xref> could be differences in the level of expression.

However, there is a great uncertainty about the identity of the phospholipid scramblases involved in such processes. This manuscript focuses on the lipid scrambling activity of ANO6/TMEM16F (hereafter ANO6), which has been proposed to be a Ca<sup>2+</sup>-activated scramblase. Yet, it has also been suggested that ANO6 is required for lipid scrambling by forming an ion channel but not by performing the scrambling activity itself. This manuscript convincingly shows that ANO6 is a ‘true’ scramblase and also indicates that the recorded ion channel activity of ANO6 is a consequence (a leak current) of phospholipid scrambling. In an elegant and very detailed manner the authors identify a minimal region in ANO6 required for PS scrambling. This is an excellent study.</p><p>1) Experiments include real-time monitoring of ion currents by patch clamp, and phospholipid scrambling using Annexin-V as indicator of exposed PtdSer. The authors find that ANO6 current is non-selective and allows passage of large ions such as NMDG+. The model concludes that ANO6 non-selective ion current coincides with phospholipid scrambling. Annexin-V has been widely used as a probe for exposed PtdSer, but Annexin-V response to PtdSer is not linear and requires a certain threshold of PtdSer to bind. Therefore, this probe is not well adapted for correlative real-time assays such as presented in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2</xref>. Notably, Annexin-V signal appears 3 min after the increase in current amplitude. This lag is commented in the text and the hypothesis raised by the authors is reasonable. However, is it possible to do the same experiment using a more robust PtdSer probe such as Lactadherin? Advantages of Lactadherin over Annexin-V have been listed in Shi J et al. 2006, a paper also cited by the authors.</p><p>2) The authors performed extensive sequence swapping studies to define the so-called scrambling domain (SCRD) in ANO6, which can confer the scrambling activity to ANO1. Mutations in SCRD prevented ANO6 from performing PtdSer scrambling. The manuscript presents a homology model of ANO6 based on the X-ray structure of nhTMEM16 to position SCRD. However, to assess the reliability of the model it is important to know the identity percentage between the two sequences and whether or not sequence gaps were introduced for sequence alignment. It is stated in the text that 1-palmitoyl-2-stearoyl-sn-glycero-3-(phospho-L-serine) has been used for docking prediction, but apparently only the polar heads of PtdSer are represented in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8">Figure 8</xref>.

The question being addressed is whether TMEM16F/ANO6 is a scramblase. This is important, as ANO6 is the ‘Scott syndrome’ protein whose functional deficiency prevents PS exposure on activated blood platelets resulting in a bleeding disorder. The ensuing studies of ANO6, and chimeric constructs comprising ANO6 sequences inserted into the non-scrambling ANO1, are very informative and this is what the authors should focus on.</p><p>The most important conclusion of the paper stems from the demonstration that a 15-amino acid stretch of ANO6, when transplanted into a comparable region of the ANO1 ion channel, confers phospholipid scramblase activity onto ANO1.
