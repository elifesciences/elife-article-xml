have revealed the impact of odors on immune cells; however, any understanding on why and how odors control cellular immunity remained unclear. We find that <italic>Drosophila</italic> employ an olfactory-immune cross-talk to tune a specific cell type, the lamellocytes, from hematopoietic-progenitor cells. We show that neuronally released GABA derived upon olfactory stimulation is utilized by blood-progenitor cells as a metabolite and through its catabolism, these cells stabilize Sima/HIFα protein. Sima capacitates blood-progenitor cells with the ability to initiate lamellocyte differentiation. This systemic axis becomes relevant for larvae dwelling in wasp-infested environments where chances of infection are high. By co-opting the olfactory route, the preconditioned animals elevate their systemic GABA levels leading to the upregulation of blood-progenitor cell Sima expression. This elevates their immune-potential and primes them to respond rapidly when infected with parasitic wasps. The present work highlights the importance of the olfaction in immunity and shows how odor detection during animal development is utilized to establish a long-range axis in the control of blood-progenitor competency and immune-priming.</p></abstract><kwd-group kwd-group-type="author-keywords"><kwd>hematopoiesis</kwd><kwd>olfaction</kwd><kwd>immunity</kwd></kwd-group><kwd-group kwd-group-type="research-organism"><title>Research organism</title><kwd><italic>D. melanogaster</italic></kwd></kwd-group><funding-group><award-group id="fund1"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100001407</institution-id><institution>Department of Biotechnology , Ministry of Science and Technology</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>DBT/PR13446/COE/34/30/2015</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Mukherjee</surname><given-names>Tina</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund2"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100001409</institution-id><institution>Department of Science and Technology, Ministry of Science and Technology</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>DST/ECR/2015/000390</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Mukherjee</surname><given-names>Tina</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund3"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100001407</institution-id><institution>Department of Biotechnology , Ministry of Science and Technology</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>Ramalingaswami Fellowship</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Mukherjee</surname><given-names>Tina</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund6"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution>DBT-The Innovative Young Biotechnologist Award (IYBA)2017</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>000390DBT-IYBA 2017</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Mukherjee</surname><given-names>Tina</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund7"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution>Centre Franco-Indien pour la Promotion de la Recherche Avancée</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>CEFIPRA</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Mukherjee</surname><given-names>Tina</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund4"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100011512</institution-id><institution>National Research Foundation</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>NRF2014S1A2A2028388</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Shim</surname><given-names>Jiwon</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund5"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100011512</institution-id><institution>National Research Foundation</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>NRF-2017R1C1B2007343</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Shim</surname><given-names>Jiwon</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><funding-statement>The funders had no role in study design, data collection and interpretation, or the decision to submit the work for publication.</funding-statement></funding-group><custom-meta-group><custom-meta specific-use="meta-only"><meta-name>Author impact statement</meta-name><meta-value>Impact of odor experience on myeloid metabolism and immunity.</meta-value></custom-meta></custom-meta-group></article-meta></front><body><sec id="s1" sec-type="intro"><title>Introduction</title><p>Hematopoiesis in <italic>Drosophila</italic> gives rise to three blood cell types: plasmatocytes, crystal cells, and lamellocytes, with characteristics that are reminiscent of the vertebrate myeloid lineage. Of these, lamellocytes which are undetectable in healthy animals, appear upon infections with the parasitic wasp, <italic>Leptopilina boulardi (L. boulardi)</italic> which triggers their development (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Crozatier et al., 2004</xref>). Within a few hours of wasp-egg deposition, the <italic>Drosophila</italic> larval hematopoietic system activates a series of cellular innate immune responses leading to massive differentiation of blood cells into lamellocytes. This includes trans-differentiation of circulating and sessile plasmatocytes and differentiation of multipotent blood-progenitor cells of the larval hematopoietic organ termed the ‘lymph gland’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Anderl et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Honti et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Márkus et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib53">Stofanko et al., 2010</xref>). As lymph gland progenitor cells differentiate, the gland ultimately disintegrates to release its blood cells into circulation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Lanot et al., 2001</xref>). Together, these events contribute toward robust lamellocyte numbers which reach a maximum at 48 hr after wasp-egg laying (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Lanot et al., 2001</xref>). Characterized by their large flattened appearance, lamellocytes encapsulate the deposited wasp-eggs and melanize them, facilitating their effective clearance (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib40">Rizki and Rizki, 1992</xref>). Lamellocyte differentiation is controlled by signals of both local and systemic origin. They encompass autonomous cell-fate-determining programs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Dragojlovic-Munther and Martinez-Agosto, 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib50">Sinenko et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Makki et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib51">Small et al., 2014</xref>) and global metabolic adaptation processes that are initiated upon infection (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Bajgar et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Dolezal et al., 2019</xref>). Blood cells therefore maintain a demand – adapted hematopoietic process to develop lamellocytes. This innate competitiveness provides a defence mechanism for the fly to limit parasitoid success. An understanding of developmental programs that prime immune-progenitor cells with potential to respond when in need forms the central focus of this investigation.</p><p>Development of multipotent blood-progenitor cells of the lymph gland relies on cues of autonomous (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Benmimoun et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Krzemień et al., 2007</xref>)and non-autonomous origin (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Banerjee et al., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Morin-Poulard et al., 2016</xref>). Of these, olfactory signaling has been implicated in their maintenance (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib49">Shim et al., 2013</xref>). Interestingly, studies in different model systems have revealed the impact of odors on immune cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib55">Strous and Shoenfeld, 2006</xref>), and revealed the influence of odors and their specificity in mediating cellular responses. Any understanding on why and how odors control cellular immunity, however, remains unclear. The present work highlights the importance of the olfaction/immune axis in immunity.</p><p>The <italic>Drosophila</italic> larval olfactory system contains 25 specific odorant receptors (OR) in 21 olfactory receptor neurons (ORNs). Orco (Or83b), an atypical OR protein, expressed in every ORN is necessary to respond to all odors. Odors are sensed by larval dorsal organ, which is innervated by dendrites of these ORNs that project to specific glomerulus of the larval antennal lobe. Here, ORNs form excitatory synapses with projection neurons (PN) whose axons innervate into regions of the brain representative of higher order information processing. The different glomeruli are interconnected by excitatory or inhibitory local interneurons that fine-tune the ORN-PN network. It has been previously shown that during <italic>Drosophila</italic> larval development, olfaction stimulates the release of GABA from neurosecretory cells of the brain, which systemically activates GABA<sub>B</sub>R signaling in the progenitor cells to support their maintenance (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib49">Shim et al., 2013</xref>). In animals with olfactory dysfunction, this systemic cross-talk is perturbed and drives precocious differentiation of blood-progenitor cells. In the current study, we show that animals employ the olfactory/immune cross-talk to tune lamellocyte potential of hematopoietic-progenitor cells. The neuronally released GABA derived upon olfactory stimulation is utilized by blood-progenitor cells as a metabolite to stabilize Sima/HIFα protein. Sima is a well-characterized transcription factor known for its role in inducing hypoxia response (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib41">Romero et al., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib46">Semenza and Wang, 1992</xref>), which in immune progenitor cells is necessary to drive lamellocyte differentiation. While developmentally the olfaction/GABA systemic axis sustains the ability of progenitor cells to differentiate into lamellocytes, animals rearing in parasitoid threatened states co-opt this olfactory axis to prime immunity to respond to infections more rapidly and effectively. Overall, our study explores the mechanistic and physiological relevance of the olfaction/immune connection during <italic>Drosophila</italic> larval hematopoiesis and establishes its importance in the maintenance of a competent demand-adapted immune system.</p></sec><sec id="s2" sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><sec id="s2-1"><title>Olfaction controls cellular immune response necessary to combat parasitic wasp infections</title><p>In order to assess the influence of olfaction on the immunity, we infected <italic>Drosophila</italic> larvae with olfactory dysfunction, with parasitic wasps, <italic>L. boulardi</italic> and assessed for cellular immune response. We analyzed: (1) <italic>orco</italic> mutant (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">Neuhaus et al., 2005</xref>), the common odorant co-receptor 83b necessary for all odor responsiveness (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Larsson et al., 2004</xref>) (<italic>orco<sup>1</sup>/orco<sup>1</sup></italic>; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1A–D</xref>), (2) <italic>Orco&gt;Hid, rpr</italic>, which genetically ablated all ORNs (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1A,B</xref>), and (3) <italic>Or42a&gt;Hid,</italic> which specifically ablated Or42a, the ORN implicated in sensing of food-related odors (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1E–G</xref>). We addressed the cellular immune response to wasp-infection in genetic and physiological conditions with altered odor environment. Lamellocytes were assessed in the lymph gland at 24 hr post-infection (HPI) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1A</xref>), and in circulation at 48 HPI (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1A’</xref>). A comparative analysis of immune cells was also undertaken in uninfected conditions both in the lymph gland and circulation (shown in <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="supp1">Supplementary files 1</xref> and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="supp2">2</xref>). We found that animals with olfactory dysfunction demonstrated a specific loss in lamellocyte formation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1A–G</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1A–E</xref>). The formation of mature immune cell types seen in homeostasis like the crystal cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1F</xref>) and plasmatocytes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib49">Shim et al., 2013</xref>), however, remained unaffected. This implied a specific role for olfaction in controlling lamellocyte formation. Upon wasp-infection, apart from <italic>Orco&gt;Hid, rpr</italic> where a reduction in total cell numbers was apparent in comparison to its control, all other genetic contexts showed comparable cell densities with respect to their stage matched control (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1E</xref>). The reduction in <italic>Orco&gt;Hid, rpr</italic> seemed specific to <italic>Orco&gt;</italic> background as any such change in <italic>orco</italic> mutants was undetectable. These data implied that the lamellocyte defect was not a consequence of general dampening of immune cell numbers and was specific to the loss of lamellocyte potential in olfactory mutants. In uninfected conditions, analysis of lymph gland and circulating hemocytes for lamellocytes and immune cell densities in olfactory mutant genetic contexts did not reveal any difference and were comparable to controls (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="supp1">Supplementary files 1</xref> and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="supp2">2</xref>).

For this, <italic>Drosophila</italic> larvae were reared from early embryonic stage in food medium with minimal odors but nutritionally equivalent to regular diet (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib49">Shim et al., 2013</xref>). These animals were then infected with wasps and their lamellocyte response was analyzed. Interestingly, this condition recapitulated the lamellocyte formation defect seen upon loss of Or42a. Supplementing the minimal medium with food odors corrected the defect (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1C,D</xref>). Together, with the loss-of-function mutation and food-odor experiment, the data demonstrated the importance of food odors and their sensing in lamellocyte cell fate specification.</p><p>Downstream of odor detection, activation of PN is necessary to mediate systemic release of GABA from neurosecretory cells of the larval brain.

Blocking PN signaling (<italic>GH146&gt;ChAT<sup>RNAi</sup></italic>) abrogated lamellocyte formation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1G</xref>). Similarly, blocking GABA biosynthesis in GABA-producing neurosecretory cells (<italic>Kurs6&gt;Gad1<sup>RNAi</sup></italic>) led to specific loss in lamellocyte formation in response to infection (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1H–J</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1E</xref>).

Moreover, the above-mentioned neuronal manipulations did not affect PSC (posterior signaling center, niche) cell numbers, whose function in cellular immune response has been well established (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Makki et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Louradour et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s2">Figure 1—figure supplement 2E,J,O and T</xref>).

A significant increase in lymph gland lamellocyte numbers was evident at 24HPI (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s1">Figure 2—figure supplement 1K</xref>). Their numbers in circulation at 48HPI, however, remained comparable to control genetic backgrounds (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s1">Figure 2—figure supplement 1L,N and O</xref>).

These data implied a GABA<sub>B</sub>R-signaling-independent function for GABA in lamellocyte differentiation.

This led us to explore the metabolic implications of GABA in the immune response. This was undertaken by an expression analysis of Gat, a functional GABA-transporter that facilitates GABA uptake (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2A</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib58">Thimgan et al., 2006</xref>) and analysis of intracellular GABA levels (iGABA, see methods for staining details) in lymph gland tissues. In homeostatic conditions, Gat expression, using an anti-Gat antibody (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">Muthukumar et al., 2014</xref>), revealed uniform levels in all cells of the lymph gland (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2B</xref>). Within 6 hr of wasp-infection (6HPI), a twofold upregulation was detected in all blood cells of the lymph gland (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2C,D</xref>). Correspondingly, at 6HPI a twofold increase in iGABA levels was also noticed (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2E–G</xref>). The iGABA levels were sensitive to changes in blood-progenitor <italic>Gat</italic> expression (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2H–K</xref>). Downregulating <italic>Gat</italic> in blood-progenitor cells using <italic>Gat<sup>RNAi</sup>,</italic> (<italic>dome-MESO&gt;Gat<sup>RNAi</sup></italic>) was sufficient to substantially reduce iGABA levels in homeostasis (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2H,J</xref>) and post-infection (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2I,K</xref>). This suggested a role for Gat in moderating intracellular GABA levels in blood-progenitor cells. Downregulating <italic>Gat</italic> (<italic>dome-MESO&gt;Gat<sup>RNAi</sup></italic> and <italic>Tep4&gt;Gat<sup>RNAi</sup></italic>) resulted in a dramatic loss in lamellocyte formation in the lymph gland (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2L,M and P</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s2">Figure 2—figure supplement 2A,J</xref>) and circulation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2Q</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s2">Figure 2—figure supplement 2B,E,F and K</xref>). Using additional RNA<italic>i</italic> lines we corroborated the lamellocyte phenotype, and observed a reduction at 48HPI in circulation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s2">Figure 2—figure supplement 2A,B</xref>). On the other hand, over-expression of <italic>Gat</italic> in progenitor cells (<italic>dome-MESO&gt;Gat</italic>), which elevated intracellular GABA levels in lymph gland blood cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s2">Figure 2—figure supplement 2C,D</xref>) was sufficient to expand lamellocyte numbers both in lymph gland (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2N,P</xref>) and circulation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2Q</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s2">Figure 2—figure supplement 2G</xref>).

This showed that Gat function in progenitor cells was necessary and sufficient for lamellocyte determination. Gat expression in progenitor cells was limiting and raising its levels either genetically or upon infection led to expansion of lamellocyte numbers. These genetic perturbations did not alter blood-cell densities post-infection or in uninfected states (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s2">Figure 2—figure supplement 2I</xref> and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="supp2">Supplementary file 2</xref>), implying specificity in Gat function in controlling lamellocyte differentiation without affecting overall blood development.</p><fig-group><fig id="fig2" position="float"><label>Figure 2.</label><caption><title>GABA-uptake and catabolism is necessary for lamellocyte formation.</title><p>DNA is marked with DAPI (blue), GABA Transporter (Gat, red), intracellular GABA (iGABA, green), and blood cells are marked with phalloidin (red).

For this, synchronized first instar larvae were raised on food containing 3–5% succinate and then subjected to wasp-infections, which was followed by analysis of their cellular immune response. This diet did not affect general aspects of lymph gland development and hematopoiesis. Progenitor and differentiated blood-cell profiles showed no changes and remained comparable to larvae raised on regular food (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s4">Figure 2—figure supplement 4A–C</xref> and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="supp3">Supplementary file 3</xref>).

Downregulating these TCA enzymes did not lead to any defect in lamellocyte formation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s5">Figure 2—figure supplement 5A–C</xref>). Even though the expression of these enzymes is detected in lymph glands (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s5">Figure 2—figure supplement 5D and E</xref>) their loss-of-function data highlighted a TCA-independent but GABA-catabolism-dependent control of lamellocyte differentiation in blood-progenitor cells. The independence of TCA in this context is intriguing, and we speculate separate pools of succinate in blood cells that are maintained to control basal cellular metabolism and specialized immune requirements. The TCA-derived succinate most likely conducts basal metabolic functions, and the GABA-catabolism-derived succinate sustains the immune requirement of these blood cells. As a result, blocking GABA uptake and its catabolism without compromising basal cellular metabolism still allowed the development and differentiation to other blood cell types, but nevertheless impeded lamellocyte potential. Together, these data revealed a role for GABA-catabolic pathway in supporting succinate availability in blood cells upon wasp-infections that is necessary toward mounting a lamellocyte response.</p></sec><sec id="s2-4"><title>Lamellocyte differentiation is Sima dependent</title><p>We next explored the downstream effector role of succinate in lamellocyte differentiation.

This was undertaken by staining <italic>Gat<sup>RNAi</sup></italic> and <italic>Ssadh<sup>RNAi</sup></italic> mutant lymph glands with anti-Sima protein antibody in uninfected and wasp-infected scenarios. Compared to uninfected control 3rd instar lymph glands (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3A</xref>), Sima protein levels in <italic>dome-MESO&gt;Gat<sup>RNAi</sup></italic> (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3F</xref>) and <italic>dome-MESO&gt;Ssadh<sup>RNAi</sup></italic> (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3H</xref>) conditions was significantly reduced (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3J</xref>). These mutants also demonstrated a failure to raise Sima protein levels post-infection (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3K,M and O</xref>). Succinate supplementation of these animals revealed a dramatic recovery in Sima protein levels almost comparable to that seen in controls on regular food (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3F–O</xref>). This data was consistent with succinate-mediated restoration of lamellocyte phenotypes in <italic>Gat<sup>RNAi</sup></italic> and <italic>Ssadh<sup>RNAi</sup></italic> backgrounds and implied GABA function in moderating progenitor Sima levels. Further, <italic>Gat</italic> over-expressing lymph glands (<italic>dome-MESO&gt;Gat</italic>) with elevated intracellular GABA (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s2">Figure 2—figure supplement 2D</xref>), when stained for Sima protein revealed elevated expression (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s1">Figure 3—figure supplement 1O,O’ and Q</xref>). Taken together, these data showed an important requirement for intracellular GABA-catabolism in regulating Sima protein expression in lymph gland blood-progenitor cells. These data are also suggestive of GABA-breakdown into succinate whose availability moderated Sima protein levels.</p><p>Sima protein is marked for proteasomal-mediated degradation by hydroxy-prolyl hydroxylase (Hph [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib44">Schofield and Ratcliffe, 2005</xref>]) whose enzymatic activity is inhibited by succinate (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">Mills and O'Neill, 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">Pappalardo et al., 1992</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib57">Tannahill et al., 2013</xref>). Hence, GABA-breakdown can moderate progenitor Sima protein levels by inhibiting Hph function through regulating succinate availability. This was tested by conducting genetic perturbations to modulate <italic>Hph</italic> expression in blood-progenitor cells. Over-expression of <italic>Hph</italic> that would downregulate Sima protein stability, recapitulated Sima loss-of function phenotype (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3P,T and U</xref>). The lamellocyte numbers were significantly downregulated in the lymph gland (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3P</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s1">Figure 3—figure supplement 1J</xref>) and in circulation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3U</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s1">Figure 3—figure supplement 1K and L</xref>). Conversely, downregulating <italic>Hph</italic> function by expressing <italic>Hph<sup>RNAi</sup></italic> in progenitor cells as the means to increase Sima protein, led to a concomitant increase in lamellocyte numbers (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3Q,T and U</xref>). In comparison to the numbers detected at 24HPI in the lymph glands (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3Q</xref>), the extent of increase was more evident at 48HPI in circulation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3U</xref>). Finally, expressing <italic>Hph<sup>RNAi</sup></italic> in blood progenitor-cells lacking <italic>Gat</italic> expression (<italic>dome-MESO&gt;UAS-Gat<sup>RNAi</sup>; UAS-Hph<sup>RNAi</sup></italic>) rescued the <italic>Gat<sup>RNAi</sup></italic> lamellocyte defect significantly, both in the lymph gland (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3R–T</xref>) and circulation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3U</xref>). These results confirmed a role for Hph function in progenitor cells in moderating lamellocyte development. They also confirmed an epistatic relationship between Gat and Hph function in blood-progenitor cells. Over-expressing Sima in progenitor cells using <italic>dome-MESO&gt;</italic> or <italic>Tep1V&gt;</italic> led to larval lethality, which hindered the epistatic relationship between Gat and Sima in progenitor cells. The lethality seen with Sima over-expression with these drivers may be a consequence of non-autnomous expression in tissues other than blood that compromised viability. However, an alternative approach where wild-type larvae were rasied on diets supplemented with additional GABA or succinate, showed elevated Sima protein expression in lymph gland blood-progenitor cells as compared to regular dietary states (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s1">Figure 4—figure supplement 1A–D</xref>). In response to wasp-infection, diet-supplemented animals mounted a superior lamellocyte response than seen in regular dietary condition (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s1">Figure 4—figure supplement 1E</xref>). The immune benefit of GABA and succinate supplementation was lost with progenitor-cell-specific (Dome<sup>+</sup>) abrogation of <italic>sima</italic> expression (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s1">Figure 4—figure supplement 1E</xref>). These data implicated Sima function in Dome<sup>+</sup> blood-progenitor cells, downstream of GABA and succinate, in mediating the lamellocyte response. The data also showed that systemic GABA levels were limiting and when supplemented, animals were capable of mounting a superior lamellocyte response.</p></sec><sec id="s2-6"><title>Olfaction systemically controls blood-progenitor Sima stabilization</title><p>Animals with olfactory dysfunction (<italic>orco<sup>1</sup>/orco<sup>1</sup>, Orco&gt;Hid, rpr</italic>) or abrogated for neuronal GABA synthesis (<italic>Kurs6&gt;Gad1<sup>RNAi</sup></italic>) have reduced levels of systemic hemolymph GABA (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib49">Shim et al., 2013</xref>).

During hematopoiesis, systemic GABA-uptake and catabolism in lymph gland blood-progenitor cells inhibits Hph activity. This likley facilitates stabilization of Sima protein in progenitor cells and controls their lamellocyte potential. In response to wasp-infection, immune-progenitor cells increase their Gat expression, thereby increasing GABA uptake. This further increases progenitor Sima levels necessary for lamellocyte differentiation. Olfactory dysfunction or <italic>Gat</italic> and <italic>Ssadh</italic> mutants fail to achieve the threshold levels of Sima in blood-progenitor cells. Hence in these conditions, the animals fail to induce lamellocytes.</p></sec><sec id="s2-7"><title>Pathogenic odors induce immune priming</title><p>The establishment of lamellocyte potential by a long-range metabolic cross-talk set up by odor detection was puzzling. We therefore asked if the olfactory axis was involved in sensing wasps and if prior pathogenic odor experience during development influenced any aspect of the immune response. This was addressed by experiments mimicking <italic>Drosophila</italic> larvae rearing in wasp-infested scenarios as in the wild, where the chances of infection are higher. We reared <italic>Drosophila</italic> larvae from early embryonic stages in a food medium that was infused with wasp odors (a condition referred to as wasp-odor food [WOF] and see Materials and methods for experimental details). These preconditioned animals were subjected to wasp immune challenge with <italic>L. boulardi</italic> followed by analysis of their cellular immune response. Immune response in larvae reared on regular food medium were used as experimental controls. WOF animals demonstrated a significant increase in lamellocyte numbers in response to <italic>L. boulardi</italic> infection (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5A,B</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5s1">Figure 5—figure supplement 1A</xref>). A twofold increase at 24HPI in lymph gland lamellocyte numbers (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5A,D and E</xref>) was evident in wasp-odor-enriched condition. Any increase in overall size of the lymph gland in WOF-infected animals was not evident (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5D,E</xref>). An increase in circulating lamellocyte numbers at 48HPI was also evident (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5B</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5s1">Figure 5—figure supplement 1A</xref>), without significant difference in cell densities (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5s1">Figure 5—figure supplement 1B</xref>). This implied that WOF condition led to more lamellocyte formation in response to wasp-infection. We also analyzed lymph glands and circulating immune cells for lamellocyte formation in homeostatic conditions. We observed that these preconditioned animals even in the absence of infection could ectopically generate lamellocytes, both in the lymph gland and circulation (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="supp1">Supplementary file 1</xref> and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="supp2">2</xref>). This recapitulated phenotypes seen with GF or SF supplemented food and also with Gat-overexpressing animals. Hence, we investigated GABA levels in animals in the homeostatic uninfected condition. Surprisingly, a twofold increase in hemolymph GABA levels was detected (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5C</xref>). Correspondingly, lymph gland blood-cell iGABA (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5F,G</xref>) and Sima protein (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5H,I</xref>) levels were increased as well. This showed that WOF preconditioned animals had developmentally elevated systemic GABA availability, which consequently raised progenitor Sima expression and led to improved lamellocyte potential. The immune-benefit thus seemed unlikely of any dramatic increase in lymph gland progenitor population. Moreover, differentiation into plasmatocytes (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="supp3">Supplementary file 3</xref>) or crystal cells (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="supp5">Supplementary file 5</xref>) was comparable to controls. This implied specificity of wasp-odors in priming lamellocyte potential as opposed to controlling general blood-cell differentiation.</p><fig-group><fig id="fig5" position="float"><label>Figure 5.</label><caption><title>Physiological role for odors in blood cell immunity.</title><p>DNA is marked with DAPI (blue), iGABA (green), Sima protein (red), and Myospheroid (Mys) staining (red) is employed to mark the lamellocytes in lymph gland Scale bars in panels D-O = 20 µm.

Altogether, these data showed that Or49a function was not necessary for basal lamellocyte induction or controlling developmental levels of systemic GABA levels or progenitor iGABA and Sima expression. Or49a function was however necessary for mediating the immune benefits seen in WOF condition. Genetic approaches, which force activate Or49a, recapitulated an increase in lamellocytes as seen in WOF condition even in regular food conditions (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5R and S</xref>). Interestingly, a similar increase was not evident with activation of Or42a (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5s1">Figure 5—figure supplement 1L</xref>), which is unexpected as its loss abrogated lamellocyte induction. These results showed the importance of Or42a function in the establishment of basal lamellocyte potential but insufficiency in expanding their numbers. Or49a on the other hand was capable of enhancing lamellocyte potential but was dispensible for basal lamellocyte induction.</p><p>Finally, we investigated the functional implications of the increased lamellocyte phenotype on the success of the immune response. In a normal immune response, the deposited wasp-eggs are encapsulated by lamellocytes leading to the formation of a melanotic capsule and killing of the parasitoid egg. We monitored parasitoid wasp-egg encapsulation response and percent melanization response. Encapsulation response was measured by counting the number of encapsulated and un-encapsulated wasp-eggs per larvae (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib59">Vanha-Aho et al., 2015</xref>) and for percentage melanization, infected larvae carrying melanotic wasp-egg capsules (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib62">Yang et al., 2015</xref>), see Materials and methods for details) post wasp-infection were estimated and represented as the percentage of larvae with black capsule to the total number of infected larvae.</p><p>In our hands, control larvae showed around 30% encapsulation response, while in WOF and <italic>Or49a&gt;TrpA1</italic>, this was increased to 50% (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5T</xref>). Furthermore, 50% control larvae showed melanization response while in WOF and <italic>Or49a&gt;TrpA1</italic> condition this was also increased to 75% (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5s2">Figure 5—figure supplement 2A</xref>). Blocking the pathway on the other hand, led to a reduction in wasp-egg encapsulation and melanization response (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5s2">Figure 5—figure supplement 2B–D</xref>). These results highlight the physiological significance of the increased lamellocyte phenotype on effective wasp-egg clearance. Encapsulation response also requires concerted action of activated immune cells including plasmatocytes and crystal cells apart from lamellocytes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Dudzic et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Anderl et al., 2016</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib52">Sorrentino et al., 2002</xref>). Therefore, an overall improved repertoire of immune cells in WOF and <italic>Or49a &gt;TrpA1</italic> condition can be hypothesized. Taken together, these findings reveal the importance of environmental odor perception on cellular immune priming and function.</p></sec></sec><sec id="s3" sec-type="discussion"><title>Discussion</title><sec id="s3-1"><title>Olfaction-immune axis in development and stress response</title><p>The olfactory-immune connect is a well-established phenomenon across systems (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib55">Strous and Shoenfeld, 2006</xref>). Animals with olfactory dysfunction have heightened inflammatory signatures but fail to mount immune response when challenged (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Connor et al., 2000</xref>). The mechanistic and physiological underpinnings of olfaction and immune cross-talk in development and infection however remain poorly characterized.</p><p>In this study, we explore the importance of olfaction in cellular immune responses during <italic>Drosophila</italic> larval hematopoiesis. We show that as <italic>Drosophila</italic> larvae dwell into their food medium, sensing of food-related odors, which are the predominant odors present in their environment, leads to activation of a neuronal circuit (ORN-PN-Kurs6<sup>+</sup>GABA<sup>+</sup> neuronal route). This stimulates Kurs6<sup>+</sup>GABA<sup>+</sup> neurosecretory cells to release GABA whose sensing and uptake via GABA transporter, Gat, in blood-progenitor cells of the lymph gland and intracellular breakdown establishes a non-autonomous axis that controls intracellular levels of Sima protein expression. Within 6 hr of infection with parasitic wasps, immune progenitor cells upregulate Gat protein expression. This enables cells to internalize more GABA and its metabolism further raises progenitor Sima protein expression and transcriptional activation that leads to progenitor differentiation into lamellocytes. Our data suggest a transcriptional role for Sima in promoting a metabolic shift in blood-progenitor cells which are in agreement with existing literature (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Bajgar et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Dolezal et al., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Krejčová et al., 2019</xref>) via activation of its target gene, <italic>Ldh</italic> whose function is also necessary for lamellocyte formation. In the absence of food odors, or in anosmic animals, the lack of olfactory input blocks neuronal GABA production and release. This subsequently affects progenitor GABA-metabolism and Sima protein expression leading to loss of immune potential necessary for lamellocyte formation. The basal activation of the olfactory circuit through food odors is central for specifying lamellocyte cell fate. We posit that in animals dwelling in conditions where chances of infection are high, this systemic route can be co-opted to raise their immune output. The prior sensing of wasps, by <italic>Drosophila</italic> larvae early in development via Or49a raises downstream PN-activity leading to enhanced GABA production and elevation of blood-progenitor cell Sima protein levels. This leads to superior immune-priming of progenitor cells and when infected these animals generate lamellocytes more rapidly and effectively (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6</xref>).</p><fig id="fig6" position="float"><label>Figure 6.</label><caption><title>Developmental control of immune-competency by environmental odors.</title><p><italic>Drosophila</italic> larvae spend most of their time dwelling in food. The odors derived from this eco-system defines an integral immune-component during hematopoiesis. Sensing food odors via Or42a stimulates projection neurons (PN) leading to downstream activation of Kurs6<sup>+</sup>GABA<sup>+</sup> neurosecretory cells, which mediate release of GABA (eGABA) into the hemolymph. eGABA is internalized by lymph gland blood-progenitor cells via GABA-transporter (Gat) and its subsequent intracellular catabolism leads to stabilization of Sima protein in them. This establishes their immune-competency to differentiate into lamellocytes. Physiologically, this sensory odor axis is co-opted to detect environmental pathogenic wasp-odors. Upon detection of wasp odors via Or49a in the preconditioned media (WOF), a combinatorial stimulation of both Or42a and Or49a, elevates neuronal GABA release, leading to increase blood cell iGABA and Sima expression. This developmentally establishes superior immune-competency to withstand the immune-challenge by parasitic wasps.</p></caption><graphic mime-subtype="tiff" mimetype="image" xlink:href="elife-60376-fig6-v2.tif"/></fig><p>The study reveals an unconventional developmental and stress-sensing role for the olfactory system in the sustenance of a competitive repertoire of immune progenitor cells. The utilization of Or42a, the most predominant OR activated in response to food-related odors, establishes a route that systemically connects the olfactory modality to the development of the immune system (ORN-PN-Kurs6-GABA-hematopoietic cells). The systemic connection sensitizes immune cells to environmental stressors such as the presence of wasps and promotes an innate immune training component when growing in conditions with higher chances of infection. However, it is not the overall strength of the olfactory input that controls immune-efficiency, but more specific to certain odors or activation of specific ORNs that can ultimately increase neuronal GABA production. The genetic data on forced activation of Or42a and Or49a support this notion, where activation of Or49a reciprocated with an enhancement of immune response as seen in wasp-odor enriched conditions, while activation of Or42a (<italic>Or42a&gt;TrpA1</italic>) did not. This suggests that the stimulation of Or49a in the wasp-odor condtion is able to further raise downstream neuronal activity that can enhance GABA production. This raises the question of the impact of other pathogenic odors on immune-priming. Exposure of larvae to odors of varying natures (both attractive and aversive) provides some insight. Specifically, exposure to 1-octen-3-ol, did not elevate GABA levels or increase lamellocyte differentiation. 1-octen-3-ol, is a fungal aversive odorant that has been shown to affect larval plasmatocyte responses by controlling nitric oxide signaling (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Inamdar and Bennett, 2014</xref>). This reflects the specificity of wasp-odors, its sensing and downstream signaling route employed to elevate GABA and mount lamellocyte priming.</p><p>An understanding of the complexities of cross-talk between individual ORN and their respective glomeruli and how they control PN activity is beginning to emerge and especially for specialized ORNs like Or49a, their modality of signaling is very unique (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Berck et al., 2016</xref>). The early activation of Or49a in larval development is perceived as a stress response and is a bonus for the animal in priming immune potential. Larval Or49a is tuned to detect iridomyrmecin, which is an odor produced specifically by <italic>Leptopilina</italic> wasps (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Ebrahim et al., 2015</xref>). Hence, a similar consequence on immune-priming with iridoid-producing <italic>Leptopilina</italic> can be predicted, but still remains to be tested.</p></sec><sec id="s3-2"><title>Dual-use of GABA in the development of a competent hematopoietic system</title><p>Within the lymph gland, the blood-progenitor cells express both GABA<sub>B</sub>R and Gat. While extracellular ligand-dependent GABA/GABA<sub>B</sub>R signaling promotes progenitor maintenance, the intracellular GABA metabolic pathway controls immune-differentiation potential. Ligand functions of GABA via binding to GABA<sub>B</sub>R in progenitor cells elevates intracellular Ca<sup>2+</sup> which is necessary for their maintenance in their undifferentiated state (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib49">Shim et al., 2013</xref>). GABA uptake by Gat and its intracellular catabolism to promote Sima levels in blood cells on the other hand sustains a metabolic state necessary for their competency to differentiate into lamellocytes. Thus, immune cells therefore employ dual-use of GABA both as a developmental cue and as an inflammatory cue during hematopoietic development to maintain a demand-adapted immune-response. The two pathways run parallel to each other and loss of either does not impede the functioning of the other. When blood cell GABA metabolism is abrogated, blood-progenitor differentiation into lamellocyte is affected, but overall lymph gland development is unaffected and is unlike <italic>GABA<sub>B</sub>R1<sup>RNAi</sup></italic> expressing blood-progenitor cells. On the other hand, when blood cell GABA<sub>B</sub>R signaling is aborogated, blood-progenitor cell maintenance is affected but lamellocyte differentiation is unperturbed. Rather <italic>GABA<sub>B</sub>R1<sup>RNAi</sup></italic> expressing blood progenitor cells show a mild increase in Sima protein levels (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s1">Figure 3—figure supplement 1P,P’ and Q</xref>) alongside formation of more lamellocytes. Thus blood-progenitor cells switch from a maintenance role for GABA (GABA/ GABA<sub>B</sub>R/Ca<sup>2+</sup> signaling) to its inflammatory function (GABA metabolism) in response to wasp-infection, which we hypothesize is at the level of Gat expression. This notion is supported by upregulation of Gat expression in response to wasp-infection, preceding the initiation of the inflammatory cellular response. Secondly, progenitor-cells over-expressing Gat even in homeostasis generate lamellocytes independent of infection. Thus limiting levels of Gat expression in progenitor-cells emerges as a potential regulator of GABA’s role as an inflammatory molecule.</p><p>The role of GABA as a general immune modulator is beginning to emerge from studies in vertebrates as well. Both GABA<sub>B</sub>R and Gat are detected in immune cells of myeloid (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib56">Stuckey et al., 2005</xref>) and lymphoid origin (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Jin et al., 2013</xref>). Macrophages shift to GABA as a metabolic resource to mediate inflammatory responses (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib57">Tannahill et al., 2013</xref>). GABA function in human hematopoietic stem cells (HSCs) or progenitor cells remains unclear and to our knowledge, any direct metabolic involvement of secreted neuronally derived GABA in hematopoietic progenitor cells has not been demonstrated. The findings from our work project commonalities between the mammalian immune system and the <italic>Drosophila</italic> hematopoietic system. To what extent GABA function, as we have described herein <italic>Drosophila</italic> through sensory routes is relevant in human HSCs or common myeloid progenitor cells remains to be investigated.</p></sec><sec id="s3-3"><title>Conclusions</title><p>Being a key pro-survival sensory modality, this study expands our current understanding of olfaction beyond modulation of animal behavior, implying more diverse physiological contexts (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">Riera et al., 2017</xref>) than previously known. Most often, animals in the wild dwell in surroundings with pathogenic threats in their environment. Such is also the case with <italic>Drosophila</italic> larvae in the wild where almost 80% are infected with wasps of <italic>Leptopilina</italic> species (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Fleury et al., 2004</xref>). Larvae being more vulnerable to infection with their limited abilities to avoid predators in their environment, an adaptive mechanism that enhances immunity, poses a viable option to withstand such challenges. The control of inflammatory response by olfactory cues may therefore have arisen as a means to deal with unfavorable conditions. The use of general broad-odors to establish basic immune-potency that can be further modulated depending on environmental conditions, exemplifies a rheostat-like control by the olfactory axis. To our knowledge, such impact of odor-experience as a direct handle to fine-tune immune metabolism to enable an immune advantage is the first in vivo description of its kind. It will be interesting to determine if elements of the olfaction/immune axis described here are relevant for general myeloid development and adaptation. Studies such as these will lead to an understanding of how immunity is controlled by smell, as well as provide insights in the deployment of olfactory routes to train immunity in development and disease.</p></sec></sec><sec id="s4" sec-type="materials|methods"><title>Materials and methods</title><table-wrap id="keyresource" position="anchor"><label>Key resources table</label><table frame="hsides" rules="groups"><thead><tr><th valign="top">Reagent type <break/>(species) or resource</th><th valign="top">Designation</th><th valign="top">Source or reference</th><th valign="top">Identifiers</th><th valign="top">Additional information</th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td valign="top">Genetic reagent <break/>(<italic>D. melanogaster</italic>)</td><td valign="top"><italic>dome-MESO-Gal4, UAS-EYFP</italic></td><td valign="top">U.

progenitors in response to wasp parasitism. The authors propose that wasp odor boosts the <italic>Drosophila</italic> immune response by regulating iGABA and Sima levels in lymph glands. This reveals an interesting cross-talk between olfaction and the immune system.</p><p><bold>Decision letter after peer review:</bold></p><p>[Editors’ note: the authors submitted for reconsideration following the decision after peer review. What follows is the decision letter after the first round of review.]</p><p>Thank you for submitting your work entitled &quot;Control of cellular immune-competency by odors in <italic>Drosophila</italic>&quot; for consideration by <italic>eLife</italic>. Your article has been reviewed by a Senior Editor, a Reviewing Editor, and three reviewers. The following individuals involved in review of your submission have agreed to reveal their identity: Balint Z Kacsoh (Reviewer #2); Dan Hultmark (Reviewer #3).</p><p>Our decision has been reached after consultation between the reviewers. Based on these discussions and the individual reviews below, we regret to inform you that your work has been rejected but you are allowed to submitted to <italic>eLife</italic> a revised version of this article that will be considered as a new submission. This allows you to have more time to address reviewers' comments. If you find that this is too risky, you have also the possibility to transfer this article to another journal.</p><p>At this stage, too many controls are lacking and the paper does not stand by itself in the absence of the other joint article. The idea would be to reinforce the conclusion by (1) centering the paper on the lymph gland, (2) by clearly demonstrating the effect of wasp odors on hematopoiesis, (3) by characterizing the pathway (GABA-Succinate-SIMU) et, (4) by revealing the consequence of resistance on wasp infection.</p><p><italic>Reviewer #1:</italic></p><p>In this study, the authors established that odors participate in the control of lamellocyte differentiation, a specific immune cell type which appears in <italic>Drosophila</italic> in response to wasp parasitism and is required for wasp egg encapsulation. They propose that odor sensing leads to the release of GABA into the hemolymph, which is taken up by lymph gland progenitors. Raising <italic>Drosophila</italic> larvae on food enriched in GABA (GF) or succinate (SF) rescues defects observed in those that are unable to sense odors. They further observed an increase in Sima levels in lymph gland cells in response to wasp parasitism. Finally, they propose that wasp odor contributes to an efficient <italic>Drosophila</italic> immune response by regulating GABA and Sima levels in lymph glands.</p><p>This analysis is interesting but must be significantly improved to support the conclusions proposed by the authors. The statements drawn in the summary, as well as in the first paragraph of the discussion, are not in agreement with the data presented. Furthermore, many conclusions rely on data that are neither published nor provided in the manuscript; this is not acceptable. Several key controls are missing (see below for details). Concerning the organization of the manuscript: in the Results section only data should be given, information relative to Materials and methods/tools or comments/discussion should be shifted to the corresponding sections. The key results of the study (including controls) must be provided in the main figures and the reader should be able to understand the conclusions by analyzing them. A strong reorganization of figures (including the addition of controls) is requested to improve data presentation for clarity and to prevent the reader from getting confused among main and supporting data.</p><p>Measuring larval melanisation is not an accurate way to evaluate the success of wasp encapsulation. Indeed, melanised larvae can give rise to living wasp larvae. A more reliable criterion will be the % of wasp egg hatching (%of wasp eggs that give rise to living wasp larvae).</p><p>Furthermore, in most experiments, the authors measured the absolute numbers of lamellocytes in circulation and rely on this criterion to estimate the efficiency of the <italic>Drosophila</italic> immune response. First, the % of circulating lamellocytes relative to the total amount of circulating blood cells (that can differ depending on genetic contexts) should be more accurate/meaningful than giving an absolute number. Second, since the correlation between circulating lamellocyte numbers and the efficiency of larval wasp encapsulation is under debate (see the recent paper by Leitao et al., 2019 and also data given in this study), it is very important to systematically analyse both lamellocyte numbers (in lymph gland and in circulation) and to measure the % of wasp egg encapsulation in every genetic context.</p><p>The data relative to Sima expression and function (by lof and gof in lymph gland progenitors) has to be given in the present manuscript. The functional links between GABA levels, Hph and Sima in lymph gland progenitors have to be established. The expression of these genes in different mutant contexts has to be performed and epistasis experiments must be done to establish their hierarchy.</p><p>To establish a functional link between Orco1 and Hph the authors performed rescue experiments of orco1 mutants by expressing hph RNAi under the control of the hml-Gal4 driver which is NOT expressed in lymph gland progenitors but in circulating differentiating blood cells (Figure 3G-J). These data do not support the proposed model where the function of Hph on Sima is supposed to occur in lymph gland progenitors! Rescue experiments must be done with hph RNAi under the control of lymph gland progenitor drivers.</p><p>Concerning the contribution of wasp odor to the <italic>Drosophila</italic> immune response: data provided are not convincing (see comments below for Figure 4) The injection of oil droplets to <italic>Drosophila</italic> larvae is known to induce the immune response and leads to droplet encapsulation. This represents a very interesting alternative to address the contribution of the wasp odor to the <italic>Drosophila</italic> immune response that should be tested here.</p><p>The model presented in Figure 5 does not summarize the data presented in this study. Those that link the cascade comprising iGABA, succinate, hph, sima and Ldh to lamellocyte differentiation are not provided here. The proposed role for wasp odor is not convincing. The cooperative effects of food and wasp odors were not analyzed.</p><p>Figure 1</p><p>What about the specificity of the Gal4 drivers that are used (Or42a, Kurs6)? Are similar results obtained in Or42A&gt;hid and Or42A&gt;or42RNAi (that would preserve neurons) larvae? What about lymph gland GABA levels in Kurs6&gt;GatRNAi?</p><p>Figure 1—figure supplement 1</p><p>In Orco&gt;Hid, rp and Or42b&gt;hid: what about lymph gland lamellocyte numbers?</p><p>In RF, MOF and MOF+ food odor: what about lamellocyte differentiation in the lymph gland?</p><p>In Figure 1—figure supplement 1E in GH146&gt;ChatRNAi there are only few lamellocytes in circulation but the % of melanised larvae does not seem statistically different from controls (statistics are missing). Thus, these results contradict the correlation between circulating lamelllocyte numbers and larval melanisation (see comments above), they also contradict the role of acetylcholine in the response to the wasp parasitism via its control of GABA levels. What about GABA and Sima levels in lymph glands in these experiments?</p><p>Are there any defects in lamellocyte numbers (in the lymph gland and in circulation), in wasp egg encapsulation, in lymph gland GABA and Sima levels when acetylcholine is constitutively released?</p><p>Figure 2</p><p>It must be established here that GABA receptor is not required, and that the role of GABA is mediated by the metabolic pathway to generate succinate. This must be added and presented in the main figures.</p><p>A-D controls are missing: phenotypes (lamellocyte differentiation in lymph glands and in circulation, GABA and Sima levels in lymph glands) should be analysed in the absence of wasp parasitism and when larvae are raised on GF and SF medium. 2E-H’ controls without parasitism should be provided. Is there any difference in larval development or size when they are raised on GF or SF compared to RF?</p><p>It is essential to illustrate in this Figure (i)the internalisation of GABA in lymph gland progenitors; (ii) the requirement of GABA internalisation for lamellocyte differentiation.</p><p>2A and 2C: what about wasp egg encapsulation?</p><p>In circulation (Figure 2E’,G’,F’,H’) since the red cells are considered as lamellocytes although they do not display their specific elongated shape, a marker for mature lamellocytes (L1, β−intergrin,.…) should be used.</p><p>Figure 3</p><p>A control lymph gland picture (without parasitism) must be presented, pictures B and D should be replaced since the focus seems to be different from the other pictures shown?</p><p>All the data relative to Sima expression and function in the lymph gland should be introduced here. What about Sima expression when larvae are raised on SF in the absence of parasitism? What about lamellocyte numbers (in the lymph gland and in circulation) and wasp egg encapsulation when Sima is overexpressed (gof) or in sima loss-of-function (lof) in lymph gland progenitors? Epistasis experiments between GABA and Sima in lymph gland progenitors must be performed.</p><p>Hph expression and function in lymph gland progenitors must be analysed. Recue and epistasis experiments between GABA, Hph and Sima must be performed in lymph gland progenitors to establish whether there are functional links between them. In hml&gt;hphRNAi in Orco 1 mutants there is a strong increase in circulating lamellocyte numbers: is the total number of circulating blood cells affected?</p><p>3G-H: in hml&gt;hph RNAI without wasp parasitism, what about lamellocyte numbers (in the lymph gland and in circulation) and lymph gland GABA and Sima expression? In the corresponding text the authors use the term &quot;blood cells&quot; for both lymph gland progenitors and circulating blood cells (as identified by the hml&gt;Gal4 driver). This is very confusing since they are very distinct cell types. The adequate terms must be used for clarity.</p><p>Figure 2—figure supplement 2K: high numbers of circulating lamellocytes in Orco&gt;Hid,rp larvae raised on GF and SF. What about the number of total circulating blood cells in these conditions, about lamellocyte numbers in lymph glands and wasp egg encapsulation in these contexts? What about lamellocyte numbers (in circulation and lymph gland), in the absence of parasitism?</p><p>Figure 4</p><p>Non-infected controls are missing: experiments without wasp infection must be run in parallel with those performed under wasp parasitism conditions. This is crucial to conclude that the phenotypes observed are due only to wasp infection. 4A: there is a huge dispersion of the values, the number of larvae analysed should be extended to reduce dispersion. Lamellocyte numbers in Or49a&gt; hid-rp (RF) are similar (even superior) to Or49a&gt;+ (RF) larvae, indicating that wasp odor is not required for lamellocyte production under regular wasp infection as it is performed in the lab. These data rather suggest that raising larvae in WOF and in the absence of infection, prime the lymph gland progenitors that are now more competent to rapidly differentiate into lamellocytes upon wasp parasitism. Longer exposure of larvae to WOF or to odor concentration might have a side effect on lymph gland progenitors in control larvae. This can be seen in Figure sup 2J where at the L3 stage, a significant alteration of dome+ cells indicates that the lymph gland progenitors differ between larvae raised on WOF compared to those raised on RF. What about GABA and Sima levels in L2/L3 lymph glands from control larvae raised on WOF medium? Analyzing the immune response triggered by oil injection in larvae might help to distinguish the contribution or not of wasp odor to this response.</p><p>Since the % of wasp egg encapsulation has not been examined the authors cannot conclude that wasp odor acts on the &quot;efficiency of the immune response&quot; as stated in the text.</p><p>4G is different from Figure 3A: Why?</p><p>4J is not in agreement with the quantification given in Figure 4L, similar remark holds for 4K and 4M.</p><p>4F: higher GABA levels are observed in the cardiac tube compared to the control 4E. Unfortunately, this raises doubts about the rigor with which the experiments were performed. To prevent this interrogation, pictures should not be a tight crop around one lymph gland lobe but a larger view including surrounding tissues (cardiac tube, pericardial cells) that would allow the reader to compare backgrounds between controls and experiments.</p><p>What is the control genotype in Figure 4C-H?</p><p>Sup Figure 3O-P: what about lamellocyte numbers in the lymph gland, wasp egg encapsulation, and lymph gland GABA and Sima levels?</p><p>Sup Figure 4</p><p>What about wasp egg encapsulation, lymph gland lamellocytes, lymph gland Sima levels when the different odors are provided to <italic>Drosophila</italic> larvae?</p><p>H-L': not convincing since the quality of pictures is not good enough. Why do we see such extensive green staining in J-L'? These data are not necessary.</p><p><italic>Reviewer #2</italic>:</p><p>Madhwal et al., present their work, entitled, &quot;Control of cellular immune-competency by odors in <italic>Drosophila</italic>.&quot; In this study, the authors investigate and identify a role for <italic>Drosophila</italic> larval environmental odor experience on priming cellular immune potential. Excitingly, the authors show that odor sensing is critical to production of lamellocytes in the circulating hemolymph of a <italic>Drosophila</italic> larva. This odor detection mediates the release of GABA from neurosecretory cells and is subsequently internalized by blood progenitor-cells. This internalization is followed by catabolization to generate succinate which stabilizes Sima (HIFα) protein, key for lamellocyte production. Remarkably, <italic>Drosophila</italic> larvae in odor environments mimicking parasitoid-threatened conditions raises systemic GABA and blood-progenitor Sima levels. Thus, these larvae have a primed immune response in anticipation of infection. Also, thank you to the authors for a wonderful summary Figure (Figure 5).</p><p>Collectively, this body of work represents novel and important insight into influence of environmental odor-experience on immune phenotypes. The genetic controls and experimental lines are elegantly chosen and the manuscript is written in a very clear and logical order. The rescue experiment with GABA or succinate supplementation is especially compelling. Odorants influence myeloid- metabolism and the priming of the innate-immune system, a truly remarkable finding building on the emerging field of environmental modulation of physiology.</p><p>It is my recommendation that this important manuscript be accepted pending revisions outlined below:</p><p>The authors provide an extremely important body of work. However, I have a few concerns on the genetic dissection of the phenotype that are important to be addressed:</p><p>– The role of <italic>Leptopilina boulardi</italic> venom may be a confounding variable. As described in Markus et al., 2005, a sterile needle wound is sufficient to trigger lamellocyte production and differentiation. While the data in Figure 1 is quite compelling, I believe it important to test via sterile needle wound the wild-type and Or42a&gt;Hid line. Alternatively, sterile needle wound alone may not be sufficient to trigger the heightened response, but only in combination with odorant. This may be the case as the authors examine a general injury response. However, the methods do not outline what a general injury response is from, so I cannot conclude the finding. Either way, this would be important to address.</p><p>– The defects in melanization yield a second important question: Are crystal cells also negatively affected by the inability to detect odorants? Are crystal cell populations affected by wasp odor? This question should be investigated and can be easily by heating <italic>Drosophila</italic> larvae as described in the citation below and counting the melanin spots. If this cell type is also affected, it would provide a stronger mechanistic link between lack of melanotic activity and odor detection of either both cell types OR only lamellocytes.</p><p>– Crystal cells self-melanize when larvae are incubated at 60°C for 10 minutes.</p><p>– Williams, Ando and Hultmark, (2005).</p><p>– This point is furthered by text in the manuscript: &quot;GABA metabolism does not control differentiation of blood cells to plasmatocytes or crystal cell lineages, implying specificity of GABA in priming lamellocyte potential.&quot;</p><p>– The odorant clearly primes the immune response of the <italic>Drosophila</italic> larvae. I am left wondering what is the odorant that does the priming. The Materials and methods read:</p><p>&quot;<italic>L. boulardi</italic> wasps in the proportion of 15 females and 8 males into regular food medium&quot;.</p><p>– I believe it is important to the impact of the paper to ask whether the odorant detected is male wasp specific or female wasp specific (OR perhaps it is not specific?). Either way, this is an important outstanding question that should be addressed. Regardless of the answer, this will further catapult this exciting finding into becoming a seminal work in the field of environmental modulation of physiology. This will also provide a baseline to identify what exactly Or49a is detecting (male, female, or general wasp odor?). Pure male populations can be acquired by using virgin female wasps to infect larvae. All F1 wasps will be male, thus providing a pure odorant. I am excited to read future studies that will hopefully identify the molecule that is being detected.</p><p><italic>Reviewer #3</italic>:This is a very interesting paper, throwing more light on the mysterious connection between olfaction and immunity, previously described by some of the authors of this manuscript. The data presented here show that olfactory detection of parasites, via one or two specific odorant receptors, is required to prime the immune system for an enhanced response to later parasite attacks. They also confirm that the signal from the central nervous system to the hematopoietic tissue is mediated by GABA. GABA is taken up by the blood cell precursors, affecting their cellular metabolism and stabilizing Sima, a homolog of hypoxia-inducible factor α (HIFalpha). There, Sima is required for the generation of immune response effector cells (lamellocytes). When the authors blocked olfactory signaling, for instance by mutating a key olfactory co-receptor, the animals were unable to make lamellocytes. This capacity could be rescued, for instance by directly providing GABA, or by genetically blocking Sima turnover, thereby increasing its concentration. The results are convincing, and the links described here between olfaction, HIF signaling and immunity should be of considerable general interest. However, the paper is not very well written and some important information is missing:</p><p>1) A very recent article by Krejčová et al., (2019) describes the role of HIF signaling in the activation of <italic>Drosophila</italic> blood cells during bacterial infection. That paper very nicely complements the results described here. It was perhaps published after this manuscript was submitted, but appropriate references to that article must be added.</p><p>2) References are made to a &quot;manuscript in submission&quot; by Madhwal et al. Depending on how close that manuscript has come to publication, it may be wise to depend less on data presented there, since these data are still hidden from the reader. The authors could probably make their points by referring to other sources (e.g the above-mentioned paper by Krejčová et al.,), or to the experiments shown in the present manuscript.</p><p>3) Specifically, it is claimed that &quot;Sima is both necessary and sufficient for lamellocyte induction&quot;. The data presented here suggest that Sima is necessary, and data elsewhere point in the same direction, but I am not aware of any published data showing that it is sufficient for lamellocyte induction. If that claim is only supported by the other submitted manuscript, it is better to delete it. The presented model does not depend on it.</p><p>4) The experimental system is not fully described, leaving it to the reader to fill the gaps. For instance, it is not clearly stated which parasite is studied. The Introduction makes a general statement about &quot;Leptopilina wasps&quot;, and in the later sections, the reader has to infer that &quot;wasps&quot; or &quot;<italic>L. boulardi</italic> wasps&quot; refers to wasps of the species <italic>Leptopilina boulardi</italic>. That may seem self-evident for people in the field, but to help others it should be stated explicitly.</p><p>5) Many figures show the effects of genetic constructs, food etc. on lamellocyte production. From the context it can be inferred that these effects were often (maybe always?) studied in wasp-infected larvae. That must be clearly stated.</p><p>6) The second sentence in the Results section introduces &quot;a subset of neurosecretory cells (Kurs6+)&quot;, implying that Kurs6+ is a term for a specific set of neurons. Later, &quot;Kurs6&quot; comes up as part of a genotype. That confused me at first. It took me some time to figure out that Kurs6-Gal4 is in fact a driver construct, and that &quot;Kurs6+&quot; simply refers to cells that express this driver. It would have been helpful to properly introduce this driver to the reader.</p><p>7) The term &quot;iGABA&quot; turned up rather unexpectedly in the text, and it confused me a lot. I don't think it is understood by the general reader. Does it simply refer to intracellular GABA? If so, I strongly suggest to spell it out, rather than introducing yet another multiple-letter combination. That would not make the text significantly longer.</p><p>[Editors’ note: further revisions were suggested prior to acceptance, as described below.]</p><p>Thank you for submitting your article &quot;Metabolic control of cellular immune-competency by odors in <italic>Drosophila</italic>&quot; for consideration by <italic>eLife</italic>.

It is appropriate to hypothesize that an increase in lamellocyte production will yield a more potent immune response against parasitoids, as seen in other <italic>Drosophila</italic> species (i.e. D. suzukii). However, genetic perturbation that increase lamellocyte numbers, or perturbs the immune system in any manner, does not necessarily mean that the immune response mounted will be successful. The authors should provide experiments monitoring resistance to parasitoid wasps when the pathway they discovered is perturbated.

Pictures in Figure 3B, K and m are not in agreement with quantifications in 3O. The same comment holds for Figure 3F-L and quantifications in J. Expression of Sima in lamellocyte is also not convincing. The specificity of the Sima antibody has to be checked. Figure 3—figure supplement 1I is the difference in sima mRNA levels significant?

The authors propose that wasp odor boosts the <italic>Drosophila</italic> immune response by regulating iGABA and Sima levels in lymph glands. This reveals an interesting cross-talk between olfaction and the immune system.</p><p>There is an interest from the reviewers to publish this manuscript in <italic>eLife</italic> but some issues remained. At this stage, we encourage you to address either experimentally or by changes in the text the comments listed below (a possibility is to tune down the statements). The hope is that you can rapidly submit a revised version that addresses the few points left.</p><p>Essential revisions:</p><p>1) The regulatory cascade that goes from iGAbA to Ldh (Figure 6, left part) is not fully established, since several epistasis experiments are still lacking. For example, functional links in the lymph gland are not established between: (i) hph and sima, and more importantly between (ii) sima and Ldh and (iii) sima and iGABA. Epistasis experiments are lacking which precludes drawing in the model Figure 6 plain arrows representing functional connections. Some experiments given in the manuscript for establishing functional links are irrelevant: this is the case of the epistasis experiment between oroc1 and Sima (via hph RNAi with the hml driver; sup Figure 4L-O). The hml-gal4 driver is not expressed at all in lymph gland progenitors where hph function is supposed to be required!</p><p>One key point concerns Sima functions. In the model, Sima is acting downstream of iGABA and is required for lamellocyte differentiation in response to wasp parasitism (Figure 6, left part). Unfortunately, these regulations are not yet definitively established in the manuscript.</p><p>Why have authors not performed rescue experiments of DomeMESO&gt;Gat RNAi or (Dome-MESO&gt;Ssadh RNAi) of the mutant lymph gland phenotype by overexpressing Sima with the Dome-MESO gal4 driver? This is a key experiment that would establish whether Sima is the key payer downstream of iGaba.</p><p>Concerning the functional link between Sima and lamellocyte differentiation: Does the overexpression of Sima with the dome-MESO gal4 driver lead to a cellular immune response similar to the one observed in response to wasp infection? These are key questions that have to be addressed to sustain the model proposed in Figure 6.</p><p>2) Figure 6 (right panel) this representation is misleading and is not in agreement with the presented data. The proposed role for wasp odor for the immune response is not correct. Indeed, killing the Or49a neurons (wasp odor sensing neurons) has no impact on the immune response on larvae raised on RF (Figure 5). Thus, there is no need at all for these neurons to mount an immune response. Raising larvae on WOF leads only to an increase in the immune response that is dependent on Or49A neurons. Any conditions that lead to increased GABA levels (such as SF, GF,WOF ) and even in the absence of wasp parasitism (since lamellocytes are detected in these conditions in the absence of parasitism) have the same consequence; i. e. a boost of the immune response. This data indicates that increasing GABA levels (by activating GABAnergic neurons) by different ways leads in all conditions to boosting the immune response.</p><p>3) Ca<sup>2+</sup> levels in the lymph gland and their potential contribution to the immune response is unclear. What about Ca 2+ levels and requirement: (i) in response to wasp infection and (ii) in dome-MESO&gt;gat RNAi conditions?</p><p>4) Figure 2—figure supplement 4 and Figure 4D-E, H-I controls are missing. This concerns Figure 4D and E; Figure 4H and I and Figure 2—figure supplement 4L. In response to wasp parasitism, do wild type larvae raised in SF or GF have increased lamellocyte differentiation compared to wt parasited larvae raised on RF?</p><p>5) Figure 2—figure supplement 3: why are the authors looking at pCamKII? What does this marker indicate?</p><p>6) Figure 2—figure supplement 3P: DomeMESO&gt;gatRNAi , a decrease in iGABA is observed (Figure 2H) whereas no difference for pxn is measured. This is different from data given in Shim et al., 2013 where a decrease in GABA leads to increase Pxn? How can one reconcile these data?</p><p>7) Dome-MESO&gt;sima RNAi: Subsection “Progenitor Sima protein stability via GABA-catabolism establishes lamellocyte Potential”: one cannot write that &quot;plasmatocyte number is not affected&quot; since quantifications are missing.</p><p>8) Propositions for deleting some parts:</p><p>– Figure 3—figure supplement 1M-T' are redundant with Figure 3.</p><p>– Data relative to tango: They are based on only one RNAi treatment and they are not essential. Thus, they could be removed.</p><p>– Figure 4A', B', C', F' and G' are not informative. Cells shown have a round shape and do not correspond to lamellocytes that have a characteristic elongated morphology.</p><p>– Figure 5—figure supplement 2G there is no reference of this Figure in the manuscript!</p><p>9) I have still comments on the writing as the article, which is difficult to follow even to quite close experts.</p><p>– The Abstract is difficult to understand:</p><p>Here is a possible (suggested) Abstract based on your texts:</p><p>“Studies in different animal model systems have revealed the impact of odors on immune cells, However, any understanding on why and how odors control cellular immunity remained unclear. We find that <italic>Drosophila</italic> employ an olfactory/immune cross-talk to tune a specific cell type, the lamellocytes, from hematopoietic-progenitor cells. We show that neuronally released GABA derived upon olfactory stimulation, is utilized by blood-progenitor cells as a metabolite and through its catabolism, these cells stabilize Sima/HIFα protein in them. In blood-progenitor cells, Sima capacitates these cells with the ability to drive a metabolic state that is necessary for initiating lamellocyte differentiation. This systemic axis becomes relevant for larvae dwelling in wasp-infested environments where chances of infection are higher. By co-opting the olfactory route, the preconditioned animals elevate their systemic GABA levels leading to the up-regulation of blood-progenitor cell Sima expression. This elevates their immune-potential and primes them to respond rapidly when infected with parasitic wasps. The present work highlights the importance of the olfaction in immunity and shows how odor detection during animal development is utilized to establish a long-range axis in the control of immune-progenitor competency and priming.”</p><p>Introduction “innate competitiveness” consider rewriting this term.</p><p>Introduction: The third paragraph does not fit well the flow of the text.

What follows is the authors’ response to the first round of review.]</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Reviewer #1:</p><p>In this study, the authors established that odors participate in the control of lamellocyte differentiation, a specific immune cell type which appears in <italic>Drosophila</italic> in response to wasp parasitism and is required for wasp egg encapsulation. They propose that odor sensing leads to the release of GABA into the hemolymph, which is taken up by lymph gland progenitors. Raising <italic>Drosophila</italic> larvae on food enriched in GABA (GF) or succinate (SF) rescues defects observed in those that are unable to sense odors. They further observed an increase in Sima levels in lymph gland cells in response to wasp parasitism. Finally, they propose that wasp odor contributes to an efficient <italic>Drosophila</italic> immune response by regulating GABA and Sima levels in lymph glands.</p><p>This analysis is interesting but must be significantly improved to support the conclusions proposed by the authors. The statements drawn in the summary, as well as in the first paragraph of the discussion, are not in agreement with the data presented. Furthermore, many conclusions rely on data that are neither published nor provided in the manuscript; this is not acceptable. Several key controls are missing (see below for details). Concerning the organization of the manuscript: in the Results section only data should be given, information relative to Materials and methods/tools or comments/discussion should be shifted to the corresponding sections. The key results of the study (including controls) must be provided in the main figures and the reader should be able to understand the conclusions by analyzing them. A strong reorganization of figures (including the addition of controls) is requested to improve data presentation for clarity and to prevent the reader from getting confused among main and supporting data.</p><p>Measuring larval melanisation is not an accurate way to evaluate the success of wasp encapsulation. Indeed, melanised larvae can give rise to living wasp larvae. A more reliable criterion will be the % of wasp egg hatching (%of wasp eggs that give rise to living wasp larvae). Furthermore, in most experiments, the authors measured the absolute numbers of lamellocytes in circulation and rely on this criterion to estimate the efficiency of the <italic>Drosophila</italic> immune response.</p></disp-quote><p>The main finding of the manuscript is the importance of sensory stimulation to generate a cell type that is necessary to respond to infections by parasitic wasps. The melanization data in the previous version was added to support the functional aspect of these immune cells and that in conditions when these cells were not detected the melanization of wasp-eggs was also undetectable. The aspect of melanization itself is far more complex and we agree with the reviewer that our assays do not evaluate it and also is not the central point of our investigation. We feel if any systemic control of melanization exists, will be better understood by undertaking a more thorough analysis and best done as an independent study. Hence, the current manuscript focuses on mechanisms controlling the development of immune-competent blood-progenitor cells that are capacitated to differentiate into lamellocytes. These are are impressive cells as they are only seen in conditions of infection/inflammation and not seen in homeostasis, unlike plasmatocytes and crystal cells. The processes that define such capability to the immune system forms the central focus of this manuscript.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>First, the % of circulating lamellocytes relative to the total amount of circulating blood cells (that can differ depending on genetic contexts) should be more accurate/meaningful than giving an absolute number.</p></disp-quote><p>This is done. In addition to total lamellocytes numbers/larva, their respective proportions to total circulating blood cells is also provided for every genetic context in infected and uninfected conditions. The data in infected conditions are shown in: Figure 1—figure supplement 1E, Figure 2—figure supplement 1M, Figure 2—figure supplement 2C, Figure 2—figure supplement 5C, Figure 3—figure supplement 1L, Figure 5—figure supplement 1B and uninfected states is provided in Supplementary file 2.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Second, since the correlation between circulating lamellocyte numbers and the efficiency of larval wasp encapsulation is under debate (see the recent paper by Leitao et al., 2019 and also data given in this study), it is very important to systematically analyse both lamellocyte numbers (in lymph gland and in circulation) and to measure the % of wasp egg encapsulation in every genetic context.</p></disp-quote><p>Lymph gland lamellocyte counts are now provided for all genetic conditions.

These data do not support the proposed model where the function of Hph on Sima is supposed to occur in lymph gland progenitors! Rescue experiments must be done with hph RNAi under the control of lymph gland progenitor drivers.</p></disp-quote><p>We have attempted to do the rescue experiment as suggested by the reviewer of orco1 mutants by expressing hph RNAi under the control of a progenitor driver. However, the genetic complexity of this experiment has limited its success as the combinations were often unhealthy and failed to propagate. As a result, we have been unable to get enough larvae of the correct genotype for addressing the infection response. As we continue to attempt this question by other approaches, we utilized HmlΔGal4 to address this issue. HmlΔGal4 is a well-established lymph gland driver line. It marks differentiating blood cells of the lymph gland as early as 60h AEL ((Jung et al., 2005), (Goto et al., 2003, Mondal et al., 2011) (Charroux and Royet, 2009)). Using this driver, we find recovery of lamellocyte formation in the lymph glands of orco1 mutants. The data provides epistatic relationship of the systemic pathway in blood cells of the lymph gland and indicates that loss of Hph in Hml<sup>+</sup> is also sufficient to restore their lamellocyte formation.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Concerning the contribution of wasp odor to the <italic>Drosophila</italic> immune response: data provided are not convincing (see comments below for Figure 4) The injection of oil droplets to <italic>Drosophila</italic> larvae is known to induce the immune response and leads to droplet encapsulation.

Unfortunately, we also tried to obtain Or42a mutant lines from Carlson lab and Dennis Mathew, but failed to obtain them for the same import reasons. We feel unfortunate, but nevertheless, I also understand the point raised by the reviewer. In response to this, I would like to mention the physiological experiment done with media lacking food odors (Figure 1—figure supplement 1C and 1D) where olfactory neurons are preserved showed defective lamellocyte formation both in the lymph gland and circulation (Figure 1—figure supplement 1C and 1D) which was corrected by restoration of food odors back into the medium. Additionally, orco1 mutant larvae also showed lamellocyte defect. Subsequently, downstream of olfactory signaling we have blocked projection neurons and Kurs6 neurons which phenocopy the lamellocyte defect. Taken together, all the data show the defect in lamellocyte formation is not a consequence of loss of Or42a, rather lack of olfactory signalling.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>What about lymph gland GABA levels in Kurs6&gt;GatRNAi?</p></disp-quote><p>We do not understand the concern being raised by Kurs6&gt;GatRNAi, which would block</p><p>GABA transporter in Kurs6 neurons.

As we continue to attempt this question by other approaches, we utilized HmlΔGal4 which is also a well-established lymph gland driver line. It marks differentiating blood cells of the lymph gland as early as 60h AEL. Using this driver, we find recovery of lamellocyte formation in the lymph glands of orco1 mutants.

Lamellocyte numbers in Or49a&gt; hid-rp (RF) are similar (even superior) to Or49a&gt;+ (RF) larvae, indicating that wasp odor is not required for lamellocyte production under regular wasp infection as it is performed in the lab. These data rather suggest that raising larvae in WOF and in the absence of infection, prime the lymph gland progenitors that are now more competent to rapidly differentiate into lamellocytes upon wasp parasitism. Longer exposure of larvae to WOF or to odor concentration might have a side effect on lymph gland progenitors in control larvae. This can be seen in Figure Sup 2J where at the L3 stage, a significant alteration of dome+ cells indicates that the lymph gland progenitors differ between larvae raised on WOF compared to those raised on RF. What about GABA and Sima levels in L2/L3 lymph glands from control larvae raised on WOF medium? Analyzing the immune response triggered by oil injection in larvae might help to distinguish the contribution or not of wasp odor to this response.</p></disp-quote><p>We have attempted to clarify these points. We have added more number of samples to increase “n” values for WOF condition. But the nature of the data is the same and the dispersion is still huge. We predict this is a consequence of the nature of the experiment which shown dynamic physiology of animals and how they perceive odors and respond. However, the trend to make more lamellocytes in response to wasp-odors is significantly evident. We show upregulation of GABA and Sima levels in developing L3 lymph glands from control uninfected larvae raised on WOF medium. This is shown in Figure 5G on WOF compared to 5F on RF (GABA) and 5I on WOF compared to 5H on RF (Sima). Blocking sensing of wasp-odors by abrogating Or49a (Or49&gt;Hid) shows a failure of these animals to increase the levels of GABA and Sima as seen in WOF. The levels in Or49&gt;Hid animals raised on WOF, remain comparable to levels seen in controls on regular food. Figure 5L compared to 5G and 5F (GABA) and 5N compared to 5I and 5H (Sima). We have also undertaken sterile wounding of WOF animals to analyze immune response to general injury (this was shown in the previous version, but now omitted). While cellular immune response to injury is comparable to controls, these animals make more lamellocytes here as well. We feel the data on un-infected WOF conditions provided in Supplementary file 1 and Supplementary file 2 where lamellocyte formation is detected even in the absence of infection proves the point on wasp-odors and their contribution in improved competency of blood progenitor cells in making lamellocytes. Hence, for the sake of simplicity and linearity in the current version of the manuscript the data on injury in WOF animals is not provided, but we will be happy to add it back.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Since the % of wasp egg encapsulation has not been examined the authors cannot conclude that wasp odor acts on the &quot;efficiency of the immune response&quot; as stated in the text:</p><p>Figure 4G is different from Figure 3A: Why?</p><p>Figure 4J is not in agreement with the quantification given in Figure 4L, similar remark holds for 4K and 4M.</p><p>Figure 4F: higher GABA levels are observed in the cardiac tube compared to the control 4E.

Excitingly, the authors show that odor sensing is critical to production of lamellocytes in the circulating hemolymph of a <italic>Drosophila</italic> larva. This odor detection mediates the release of GABA from neurosecretory cells and is subsequently internalized by blood progenitor-cells. This internalization is followed by catabolization to generate succinate which stabilizes Sima (HIFα) protein, key for lamellocyte production. Remarkably, <italic>Drosophila</italic> larvae in odor environments mimicking parasitoid-threatened conditions raises systemic GABA and blood-progenitor Sima levels. Thus, these larvae have a primed immune response in anticipation of infection. Also, thank you to the authors for a wonderful summary Figure (Figure 5)!</p><p>Collectively, this body of work represents novel and important insight into influence of environmental odor-experience on immune phenotypes. The genetic controls and experimental lines are elegantly chosen, and the manuscript is written in a very clear and logical order.

Odorants influence myeloid- metabolism and the priming of the innate-immune system, a truly remarkable finding building on the emerging field of environmental modulation of physiology.</p><p>It is my recommendation that this important manuscript be accepted pending revisions outlined below:</p></disp-quote><p>We thank reviewer#2 for the positive response on our work. The suggestions made have been incorporated into the revised version of the draft and critique made have been very useful in re-writing of the manuscript. Please find our response to comments and concerns raised herewith.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>The authors provide an extremely important body of work. However, I have a few concerns on the genetic dissection of the phenotype that are important to be addressed:</p><p>– The role of Leptopilina boulardi venom may be a confounding variable. As described in Markus et al., 2005, a sterile needle wound is sufficient to trigger lamellocyte production and differentiation. While the data in Figure 1 is quite compelling, I believe it important to test via sterile needle wound the wild-type and Or42a&gt;Hid line. Alternatively, sterile needle wound alone may not be sufficient to trigger the heightened response, but only in combination with odorant. This may be the case as the authors examine a general injury response. However, the methods do not outline what a general injury response is from, so I cannot conclude the finding. Either way, this would be important to address.</p></disp-quote><p>As we understand here, the point being raised by the reviewer is about dampened lamellocyte formation in olfactory mutants is perhaps a consequence of the boulardi venom. The data we provide in the current manuscript throughout, clearly shows that cellular response to waspinfection in olfactory and GABA-metabolic mutants are specifically affected for lamellocyte formation while the overall blood cell numbers seen following infection are comparable to controls. This is reflected in comparable cell densities post wasp-infection between control <italic>w1118</italic> vs orco1/orco1, Orco&gt; vs Orco&gt;Hid, rpr, Or42a&gt; vs Or42a&gt;Hid, Kurs6&gt; vs Kurs6&gt;Gad1RNAi (Figure 1—figure supplement 1E). In all these conditions while the control makes a substantial percentage of lamellocytes, the mutants even though have similar cell densities they are incapacitated to generate lamellocytes. Implying that these animals respond to infections. The strength of wasp-infection induces heightened immune response as opposed to sterile injury as rightly mentioned byt the reviewer and clearly olfactory mutants and blocking progenitor GABA metabolic conditions are able to respond to infection but unable to mount lamellocyte differentiation. This is reflected in their lymph gland numbers and circulating lamellocyte numtbers. This defect is restored by GABA or succinate supplementation. Hence based on all the mutants described in the study, we feel it is very unlikely that all of them are more susceptible to the parasitoid venom leading to the lamellocyte defect.</p><p>– The defects in melanization yield a second important question: Are crystal cells also negatively affected by the inability to detect odorants? Are crystal cell populations affected by wasp odor? This question should be investigated and can be easily by heating <italic>Drosophila</italic> larvae as described in the citation below and counting the melanin spots. If this cell type is also affected, it would provide a stronger mechanistic link between lack of melanotic activity and odor detection of either both cell types OR only lamellocytes.– Crystal cells self-melanize when larvae are incubated at 60°C for 10 minutes– Williams, Ando and Hultmark, (2005).– This point is furthered by text in the manuscript: &quot;GABA metabolism does not control differentiation of blood cells to plasmatocytes or crystal cell lineages, implying specificity of GABA in priming lamellocyte potential.&quot;</p><p>The current manuscript has been restructured as per the overall suggestions from the reviewers and the editor to center focus on lymph gland blood-progenitor cells and their contribution to lamellocyte formation. For this reason, we have omitted all the melanization data as we feel a clear understanding of this process requires much more experimental work and is better suited as an independent piece of work. As rightly pointed here in this comment as well, addressing crystal cells and their functions in response to wasp-odors in melanization response warrants further analysis, which is currently being undertaken.</p><p>– The odorant clearly primes the immune response of the <italic>Drosophila</italic> larvae. I am left wondering what is the odorant that does the priming. The Materials and methods read:</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>&quot;L. boulardi wasps in the proportion of 15 females and 8 males into regular food medium&quot;.</p></disp-quote><p>– I believe it is important to the impact of the paper to ask whether the odorant detected is male wasp specific or female wasp specific (OR perhaps it is not specific?). Either way, this is an important outstanding question that should be addressed. Regardless of the answer, this will further catapult this exciting finding into becoming a seminal work in the field of environmental modulation of physiology. This will also provide a baseline to identify what exactly Or49a is detecting (male, female, or general wasp odor?). Pure male populations can be acquired by using virgin female wasps to infect larvae. All F1 wasps will be male, thus providing a pure odorant. I am excited to read future studies that will hopefully identify the molecule that is being detected.</p><p>We agree with the reviewer that it will be very exciting to identify the molecule that drives immue-priming. Based on data presented by (Ebrahim, Dweck et al., 2015) behavior of <italic>Drosophila</italic> larvae to wasps, it is mediated by Or49a. In this study the authors describe the specificity of Or49a towards detection of iridomyrmecin which is an odor produced specifically by <italic>Leptopilina</italic> wasps from both males and females. This study clearly shows the behavioral avoidance response to iridomyrmecin in the larvae is mediated by activation Or49a. Based on our genetic data with blocking Or49a function in WOF condition, we speculate iridomyrmecin as the molecule that functions in immune-priming capacity, however the commercial unavailability of this compound has limited us from asking this question and still remains to be tested.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Reviewer #3:</p><p>This is a very interesting paper, throwing more light on the mysterious connection between olfaction and immunity, previously described by some of the authors of this manuscript. The data presented here show that olfactory detection of parasites, via one or two specific odorant receptors, is required to prime the immune system for an enhanced response to later parasite attacks. They also confirm that the signal from the central nervous system to the hematopoietic tissue is mediated by GABA. GABA is taken up by the blood cell precursors, affecting their cellular metabolism and stabilizing Sima, a homolog of hypoxia-inducible factor α (HIFalpha). There, Sima is required for the generation of immune response effector cells (lamellocytes). When the authors blocked olfactory signaling, for instance by mutating a key olfactory co-receptor, the animals were unable to make lamellocytes. This capacity could be rescued, for instance by directly providing GABA, or by genetically blocking Sima turnover, thereby increasing its concentration. The results are convincing, and the links described here between olfaction, HIF signaling and immunity should be of considerable general interest. However, the paper is not very well written and some important information is missing:</p></disp-quote><p>We sincerely thank reviewer#3 for the positive response of our work.

It is appropriate to hypothesize that an increase in lamellocyte production will yield a more potent immune response against parasitoids, as seen in other <italic>Drosophila</italic> species (i.e. D. suzukii). However, genetic perturbation that increase lamellocyte numbers, or perturbs the immune system in any manner, does not necessarily mean that the immune response mounted will be successful.

There should monitor the impact of feeding larvae on WOF on resistance and how disturbing Or49A, Gat and Ssadh affect resistance to parasitoid wasp.</p></disp-quote><p>We thank the reviewers for their positive feedback on our manuscript.</p><p>The physiological significance of the increased lamellocyte phenotype on immune response mounted and whether it is successful or not has now been addressed by measuring the impact on wasp-egg encapsulation.

These results provide the physiological significance of the increased lamellocyte phenotype on effective wasp-egg clearance. Since encapsulation response of wasp-eggs requires concerted action of activated immune cells including plasmatocytes, crystal cells and lamellocytes (Dudzic et al., 2015, Anderl et al., 2016, Sorrentino et al., 2001), the implications of the overall improved encapsulation and melanization detected in WOF and <italic>Or49a &gt;TrpA1</italic> could also imply an improved repertoire of activated immune cells in addition to increasing lamellocyte numbers.</p><p>With the addition of this new data, the importance of olfaction in immune priming is further strengthened.

Epistasis experiments are lacking which precludes drawing in the model Figure 6 plain arrows representing functional connections.</p><p>One key point concerns Sima functions. In the model, Sima is acting downstream of iGABA and is required for lamellocyte differentiation in response to wasp parasitism (Figure 6, left part). Unfortunately, these regulations are not yet definitively established in the ms.</p><p>Why have authors not performed rescue experiments of DomeMESO&gt;Gat RNAi or (Dome-MESO&gt;Ssadh RNAi) of the mutant lymph gland phenotype by overexpressing Sima with the Dome-MESO gal4 driver? This is a key experiment that would establish whether Sima is the key payer downstream of iGaba.</p><p>Concerning the functional link between Sima and lamellocyte differentiation: Does the overexpression of Sima with the dome-MESO gal4 driver lead to a cellular immune response similar to the one observed in response to wasp infection? These are key questions that have to be addressed to sustain the model proposed in Figure 6.</p></disp-quote><p>We understand the concern raised by the reviewer regarding the epistatic relationship between iGABA, sima and Ldh. We have made attempts to conduct these epistasis experiments but have not been successful. This is mainly due to technical limitation posed by over-expression of sima or Ldh using progenitor drivers <italic>dome-MESO&gt; or Tep4&gt;</italic> drivers which lead to larval lethality. As an alternative approach we undertook GABA and succinate supplementation experiments in control animals and evaluated Sima function. These supplemented animals showed elevated Sima protein expression in progenitor cells and when infected made more lamellocytes. Expressing <italic>Sima<sup>RNAi</sup></italic> in progenitor cells, led to abrogation of the lamellocyte response seen with GABA or succinate supplementation. These data showed that GABA and Succinate mediated lamellocyte response is dependent on Sima function in progenitor cells. The data are shown in (Figure 4—figure supplement 1E). Although not conclusive the data are in agreement with our conclusions and we have now redone the model keeping in line with these concerns raised. We have used dotted lines to present the possibility of Sima and its metabolic function in lamellocyte differentiation as opposed to plain arrows representing functional connections.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Some experiments given in the manuscript for establishing functional links are irrelevant: this is the case of the epistasis experiment between oroc1 and Sima (via hph RNAi with the hml driver; sup Figure 4L-O). The hml-gal4 driver is not expressed at all in lymph gland progenitors where hph function is supposed to be required!</p></disp-quote><p>We have removed this figure. Our attempts to conduct the rescue of <italic>orco<sup>1</sup></italic> mutants by expressing hph RNAi under the control of <italic>Hml<sup>Δ</sup>Gal4</italic> were mainly undertaken to provide an epistatic relationship between olfaction and lamellocyte formation in blood cells of the lymph gland. Doing the same experiment with progenitor specific drivers was not successful, mainly due to the genetic combinations of fly strains that had limited success surviving and were often unhealthy and failed to propagate. Hence, we utilized <italic>Hml<sup>Δ</sup>Gal4</italic> which is also a well-established lymph gland driver line, but yes as the reviewer points out it marks differentiating blood cells of the lymph gland. But using this driver as well we could recover lamellocyte formation in the lymph glands of <italic>orco<sup>1</sup></italic> mutants. These data provided epistatic relationship of the systemic pathway in blood cells of the lymph gland and indicated that loss of <italic>Hph</italic> in Hml<sup>+</sup> is also sufficient to restore their lamellocyte formation. But to minimize complexity, as suggested Figure 4—figure supplement 1L-O data are now eliminated.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>2) Figure 6 (right panel) this representation is misleading and is not in agreement with the presented data. The proposed role for wasp odor for the immune response is not correct. Indeed, killing the Or49a neurons (wasp odor sensing neurons) has no impact on the immune response on larvae raised on RF (Figure 5). Thus, there is no need at all for these neurons to mount an immune response. Raising larvae on WOF leads only to an increase in the immune response that is dependent on Or49A neurons. Any conditions that lead to increased GABA levels (such as SF, GF,WOF) and even in the absence of wasp parasitism (since lamellocytes are detected in these conditions in the absence of parasitism) have the same consequence; i. e. a boost of the immune response. This data indicates that increasing GABA levels (by activating GABAnergic neurons) by different ways leads in all conditions to boosting the immune response.</p></disp-quote><p>We understand the point mentioned here and have now edited the model to mention “Boosting immune response”. We thank the reviewer for bringing this point to our attention.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>3) Ca<sup>2+</sup> levels in the lymph gland and their potential contribution to the immune response is unclear.

Based on this we concluded that the loss of lamellocyte differentiation in <italic>Gat<sup>RNAi</sup></italic> animals is most likely independent of progenitor Ca<sup>2+</sup> signaling. Also consistent with this result, expression of GABA<sub>B</sub>R<sup>RNAi</sup> in progenitor cells, which has been shown to down-regulate progenitor intracellular Ca<sup>2+</sup> levels (Shim et al., 2013) made lamellocyte formation. Hence, we understand that loss of Ca<sup>2+</sup> may not impede lamellocyte formation but any definitive role for calcium signaling in infection response and lamellocyte development needs to be investigated more thoroughly and is best done as an independent study.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>4) Figure 2—figure supplement 4 and Figure 4D-E, H-I controls are missing.

How can one reconcile these data?</p></disp-quote><p>Shim et al., 2013 established a role for extracellular GABA (eGABA) function as a ligand, which activates GABA<sub>B</sub>R signaling in blood progenitors to sustain their intra-cellular calcium homeostasis necessary for their maintenance. Consequently, loss of GABA from the brain or GABA<sub>B</sub>R signaling in blood progenitors led to increased differentiation (both Pxn and P1) with a subsequent loss of MZ (medullary zone) maintenance markers.</p><p>The current study delineates an intracellular function for GABA (iGABA), whose internalization via GABA transporter (Gat) and breakdown via Ssadh is necessary for priming blood progenitor cells to differentiate into lamellocytes. GABA uptake by progenitor cells via Gat and its catabolism drives lamellocyte differentiation, which is independent of GABA’s function as an extracellular ligand driving GABA<sub>B</sub>R signaling. This is supported by Gat and Ssadh loss-of-function data that did not impede Ca<sup>2+</sup> signaling in progenitor cells (supported by no change in pCamKII data shown in Figure 2—figure supplement 3G, H). Thus, progenitor GABA<sub>B</sub>R signaling is intact and hence their maintenance is unperturbed.</p><p>We conclude that neuronally derived extracellular GABA has dual function during blood progenitor development. (A) As a ligand, binding and activation of eGABA to progenitor GABA<sub>B</sub>R drives progenitor maintenance (Shim et al., 2013) and (B) eGABA internalization via Gat in progenitor cells and its breakdown establishes Sima protein expression essential for lamellocyte induction. We propose that the two pathways run parallel to each other and do not impede the functioning of each other. This is supported by data where <italic>Gat</italic> or <italic>Ssadh</italic> progenitor loss did not alter their GABA<sub>B</sub>R signaling and similarly, loss of GABA<sub>B</sub>R signaling in progenitor cells did not impede lamellocyte differentiation (Figure 2—figure supplement 1K and L) or Sima expression in progenitor cells (Figure 3—figure supplement 1P, P’ and Q) rather made more (Figure 2—figure supplement 1K).</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>7) Dome-MESO&gt;sima RNAi: Subsection “Progenitor Sima protein stability via GABA-catabolism establishes lamellocyte Potential”: One cannot write that &quot;plasmatocyte number is not affected&quot; since quantifications are missing.</p></disp-quote><p>Now corrected.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>8) Propositions for deleting some parts</p></disp-quote><p>– Figure 3—figure supplement 1M-T' are redundant with Figure 3.</p><p>These figures have now been removed.</p><p>– Data relative to tango: they are based on only one RNAi treatment and they are not essential.

We find that <italic>Drosophila</italic> employ an olfactory/immune cross-talk to tune a specific cell type, the lamellocytes, from hematopoietic-progenitor cells. We show that neuronally released GABA derived upon olfactory stimulation, is utilized by blood-progenitor cells as a metabolite and through its catabolism, these cells stabilize Sima/HIFα protein in them. In blood-progenitor cells, Sima capacitates these cells with the ability to drive a metabolic state that is necessary for initiating lamellocyte differentiation. This systemic axis becomes relevant for larvae dwelling in wasp-infested environments where chances of infection are higher. By co-opting the olfactory route, the pre-conditioned animals elevate their systemic GABA levels leading to the up-regulation of blood-progenitor cell Sima expression. This elevates their immune-potential and primes them to respond rapidly when infected with parasitic wasps. The present work highlights the importance of the olfaction in immunity and shows how odor detection during animal development is utilized to establish a long-range axis in the control of immune-progenitor competency and priming.”</p><p>Introduction “innate competitiveness” consider rewriting this term.</p></disp-quote><p>We have incorporated this suggested abstract and edited the Introduction accordingly.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Introduction: The third paragraph does not fit well the flow of the text.
