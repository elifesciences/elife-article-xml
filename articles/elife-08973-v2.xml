clinically important drugs. Here, we studied interactions between the microbiota and indomethacin, a nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drug (NSAID) that inhibits cyclooxygenases (COX) -1 and -2. Indomethacin was tested in both acute and chronic exposure models in mice at clinically relevant doses, which suppressed production of COX-1- and COX-2-derived prostaglandins and caused small intestinal (SI) damage. Deep sequencing analysis showed that indomethacin exposure was associated with alterations in the structure of the intestinal microbiota in both dosing models. Perturbation of the intestinal microbiome by antibiotic treatment altered indomethacin pharmacokinetics and pharmacodynamics, which is probably the result of reduced bacterial β-glucuronidase activity. Humans show considerable inter-individual differences in their microbiota and their responses to indomethacin — thus, the drug-microbe interactions described here provide candidate mediators of individualized drug responses.</p><p><bold>DOI:</bold> <ext-link ext-link-type="doi" xlink:href="10.7554/eLife.08973.001">http://dx.doi.org/10.7554/eLife.08973.001</ext-link></p></abstract><abstract abstract-type="executive-summary"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.08973.002</object-id><title>eLife digest</title><p>The bacteria that inhabit the digestive tract do more than just help to break down food. Scientists are increasingly discovering that having a healthy and diverse community of gut bacteria is essential to overall health. Changes in these communities may increase the likelihood of harmful inflammation and diseases like obesity.</p><p>Medications may alter the gut bacteria; for example, antibiotics used to treat infections may wipe out beneficial bacteria in the digestive tract. Other drugs like nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAID), which are sold over-the-counter to treat headaches and by prescription to treat pain, are known to damage the lining of the digestive tract. However, it was not clear how this affects the communities of bacteria in the gut.</p><p>Liang et al. have now used genome-sequencing tools to determine which types and quantities of bacteria are normally present at various points along the digestive tract of healthy mice. The mice were then treated with an NSAID called indomethacin, which shifted the composition of intestinal bacteria towards a pro-inflammatory structure.</p><p>Liang et al. then treated mice with antibiotics before giving them indomethacin to reduce the overall number of gut bacteria. These bacteria-depleted mice showed altered metabolism of indomethacin, and reduced blood levels of the drug, as evident in the production of fatty molecules called prostaglandins in the body. This is because the interactions between the gut bacteria and indomethacin modifies the inhibitory effect of indomethacin on enzymes known as COX-1 and COX-2. This may explain why some drugs work better in some people than others, as different people have different bacteria in their guts.</p><p>In the future, Liang et al. aim to investigate whether the communities of gut bacteria would be differently influenced by specifically inhibiting the action of either COX-1 or COX-2, given that drugs that inhibit COX-2 cause fewer gastrointestinal complications. There are also plans to explore whether alterations in the communities of gut bacteria are a driver or a passenger in gastrointestinal ailments, following ingestion of indomethacin. Previous work has shown the influence of the host molecular clock on gut bacteria. Therefore, Liang et al. will also ask if taking indomethacin at different times of day might improve how well the drug works and cause fewer side effects in animal models and eventually in humans.</p><p><bold>DOI:</bold> <ext-link ext-link-type="doi" xlink:href="10.7554/eLife.08973.002">http://dx.doi.org/10.7554/eLife.08973.002</ext-link></p></abstract><kwd-group kwd-group-type="author-keywords"><title>Author Keywords</title><kwd>microbiota</kwd><kwd>indomethacin</kwd><kwd>pharmacokinetics</kwd><kwd>glucuronidation</kwd></kwd-group><kwd-group kwd-group-type="research-organism"><title>Research Organism</title><kwd>Mouse</kwd></kwd-group><funding-group><award-group id="par-1"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000050</institution-id><institution>National Heart, Lung, and Blood Institute</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>1U54HL117798</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Liang</surname><given-names>Xue</given-names></name><name><surname>Li</surname><given-names>Xuanwen</given-names></name><name><surname>FitzGerald</surname><given-names>Garret A</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><funding-statement>The funders had no role in study design, data collection and interpretation, or the decision to submit the work for publication.</funding-statement></funding-group><custom-meta-group><custom-meta><meta-name>elife-xml-version</meta-name><meta-value>2.5</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta specific-use="meta-only"><meta-name>Author impact statement</meta-name><meta-value>Indomethacin, a nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drug, alters the composition of the intestinal microbiota, and the intestinal microbiota affect the pharmacokinetics of indomethacin.</meta-value></custom-meta></custom-meta-group></article-meta></front><body><sec id="s1" sec-type="intro"><title>Introduction</title><p>The composition of the intestinal microbiota is relatively stable in adult humans, but the taxa present differ considerably among individuals (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Gill et al., 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Arumugam et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib85">Wu et al., 2011</xref>).

These bacteria are implicated in biotransformation of over 30 approved drugs by direct or indirect mechanisms (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib62">Okuda et al., 1998</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib76">Sousa et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Clayton et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Haiser et al., 2013</xref>). For example, bacterially generated p-cresol competes with the widely used analgesic acetaminophen for O-sulfonation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Clayton et al., 2009</xref>), and digoxin is directly inactivated by the gut Actinobacterium <italic>Eggerthella lenta</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Haiser et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">2014</xref>).</p><p>Nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs) suppress prostanoid production by inhibiting the cyclooxygenase (COX)-1 and -2 enzymes. NSAIDs are widely used for relief of pain and inflammation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Green, 2001</xref>). A limitation of these drugs is their association with adverse gastrointestinal (GI) complications (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Graumlich, 2001</xref>). Coincidental disruption of both COX enzymes, such as is achieved at therapeutic doses of indomethacin in humans, is necessary to evoke GI lesions in experimental animals (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Brodie et al., 1970</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib78">Stewart et al., 1980</xref>). However, germ-free (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib68">Robert and Asano, 1977</xref>) and antibiotic-treated (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib41">Koga et al., 1999</xref>) rats are resistant to indomethacin-induced intestinal lesions, suggesting a role for the microbiota. Limited information is available as to the impact of NSAIDs on the composition of microbiome: indomethacin is reported to increase intestinal <italic>Enterococcus faecalis</italic> and decrease segmented filamentous bacteria (SFB) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Dalby et al., 2006</xref>), while DuP 697, a COX-2 inhibitor, increases the abundance of Gram-negative rods in rats (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib40">Kinouchi et al., 1998</xref>). However, whether indomethacin induces compositional changes in intestinal microbiota and whether these changes are involved in indomethacin enteropathy remains unknown. Here, we investigate interactions between indomethacin and the intestinal microbiota. Deep sequencing of longitudinal samples provided evidence that indomethacin affects the composition of the gut microbiota following both acute and chronic exposure.</p><p>Indomethacin undergoes enterohepatic recirculation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">Harman et al., 1964</xref>) — it is glucuronidated in the liver by UDP-glucuronosyltransferases (UGTs) and the glucuronide is delivered to the SI with bile acids where it is de-conjugated and reabsorbed. Previously, a specific inhibitor of bacterial β-glucuronidase was reported to reduce GI damage inflicted by the anticancer drug CPT-11 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib69">Roberts et al., 2013</xref>) and by several NSAIDs, including diclofenac, indomethacin and ketoprofen (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib70">Saitta et al., 2014</xref>). Here, we provide direct pharmacokinetic evidence documenting the influence of the intestinal microbiota on indomethacin metabolism via de-glucuronidation of its metabolites during enterohepatic recirculation. Given that inter- and intra-individual variation in the intestinal microbiota is high in humans, these results suggest a possible role for the intestinal microbiota in diversification of human responses to NSAIDs.</p></sec><sec id="s2" sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><sec id="s2-1"><title>Geographic heterogeneity in the composition of the murine intestinal microbiota</title><p>To assess the effect of indomethacin on the intestinal microbiota, we first analyzed the composition of the luminal and tissue-associated microbiota in mice prior to drug exposure (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1</xref>).

This acute dose is clinically relevant and is thus widely used in animal models (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Fukumoto et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib80">Tanigawa et al., 2013</xref>). Mucosal erosion and ulcerations were observed in SI 24 hr after indomethacin treatment (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s1">Figure 2—figure supplement 1</xref>) but not with vehicle control (PEG400). To analyze the compositional changes in microbial communities before the appearance of indomethacin-induced lesions, we analyzed animals after 6-hr of treatment. Urinary prostanoid metabolites (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s2">Figure 2—figure supplement 2</xref>) were suppressed, predominantly reflective of COX-1 (PGD-M and Tx-M) and COX-2 (PGI-M and PGE-M) inhibition. Indomethacin was detected in plasma and urine as well as in luminal contents and mucosal tissues along the intestine (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s3">Figure 2—figure supplement 3</xref>), suggesting local and systemic exposure to the drug.</p><p>Sixty mice were analyzed to characterize microbial responses to indomethacin exposure. Mice were randomly divided into three equal groups, receiving (i) 10 mg/kg indomethacin in PEG400 vehicle; (ii) PEG400 only and (iii) an untreated group. Examination of the bacterial biomasses using 16S rRNA gene qPCR revealed no effect of indomethacin, although a vehicle effect was evident (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2A</xref>). Mice treated with PEG400 showed a decrease in luminal biomasses and an increase in mucosal tissue biomasses in the distal end of the LI, compared to untreated mice. Similarly in humans, treatment with Golytely, which contains PEG 3350, has been associated with changes in the mucosal-associated microbiota in colon (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Harrell et al., 2012</xref>).</p><p>Microbial community structure along the intestine was quantified for observed species, which reflects the richness by measuring the number of operational taxonomic units (OTUs) and the Shannon Index, which indicates the diversity by taking account of both the number of OTUs and the evenness of distribution of reads among the OTU categories. Comparison between the indomethacin and PEG400 groups revealed changes primarily in the LI. Indomethacin caused an increase in richness (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2B</xref>) in the middle (p&lt;0.01, FDR corrected) and distal LI luminal content (p&lt;0.01, FDR corrected), as well as in feces (p&lt;0.01, FDR corrected), without influencing the mucosal tissues. Diversity (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2C</xref>) was decreased in the luminal content of the cecum (p&lt;0.01, FDR corrected) and in the mucosal tissue of proximal LI (p&lt;0.001, FDR corrected), while it was increased in feces (p&lt;0.05, FDR corrected). PEG400 alone increased microbial diversity in the distal LI.</p><p>The abundance of some bacterial lineages was also affected by indomethacin. <italic>Peptococcaceae</italic> expanded in the luminal content of cecum (0.45% ± 0.07%), the proximal LI (0.38% ± 0.06%) and distal LI (0.67% ± 0.06%), as well as in mucosal tissues of the cecum (0.55% ± 0.06%) and the proximal LI (0.38% ± 0.06%) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2D</xref>). <italic>Erysipelotrichaceae</italic> expanded in the mucosal tissues of cecum (0.17% ± 0.06%) and middle LI (0.12% ± 0.05%), yet were less affected in the luminal content (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2E</xref>). Separation of bacterial communities between indomethacin- or PEG400-treated mice was most evident in the LI mucosal tissues (p=0.004 for proximal LI, p=0.009 for middle LI, p=0.009 for distal LI; weighted UniFrac distance).</p></sec><sec id="s2-3"><title>Chronic indomethacin exposure also induces compositional changes in the intestinal microbiota</title><p>Since indomethacin is also chronically used in humans, we sought to understand the effects of chronic drug exposure in the mouse model. We thus introduced indomethacin in the diet, bypassing vehicle effects, in a second age and gender matched mouse cohort. Twenty mice were randomly divided into two groups, receiving control diet or an indomethacin-supplemented diet (20 ppm), administered for 7 days, and were then sacrificed one day later. This dose was selected based on the previous work (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Chiu et al., 2000</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Fjære et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib44">Leibowitz et al., 2014</xref>) and to ensure tolerability. Indomethacin significantly suppressed urinary prostanoid metabolites (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s4">Figure 2—figure supplement 4</xref>), suggesting COX-1 (PGD-M and Tx-M) and COX-2 (PGI-M and PGE-M) inhibition. The suppression was to a similar extent as was observed for the 6-hr treatment (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s2">Figure 2—figure supplement 2</xref>). Chronic indomethacin treatment was associated with a decrease in the Shannon Index in the luminal content of cecum. Richness and diversity were not affected at other GI sites (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s5">Figure 2—figure supplement 5A,B</xref>).</p><p>Several compositional changes detected in the acute treatment study were reproduced after chronic treatment. <italic>Peptococcaceae</italic> increased in relative abundance as in the acute study – in the chronic study this lineage expanded in the luminal content of cecum (0.28% ± 0.08%), proximal LI (0.35% ± 0.09%) and distal LI (0.43% ± 0.13%), as well as in mucosal tissues of cecum (0.10% ± 0.02%) and proximal LI (0.11% ± 0.02%) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s5">Figure 2—figure supplement 5C</xref>). <italic>Erysipelotrichaceae</italic>, which also expanded in the acute treatment, expanded in the chronic treatment in mucosal tissues of cecum (0.21% ± 0.07%) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s5">Figure 2—figure supplement 5D</xref>).</p><p>Thus, both acute and chronic dosing affected the microbiota. A single oral dose of indomethacin induced alterations in microbial diversity in the distal intestine and caused compositional changes along the intestine, with only slight effects on microbial biomasses. Chronic indomethacin treatment exhibited some of the same effects on microbial composition for both the lineages affected and directions of change.</p></sec><sec id="s2-4"><title>Indomethacin induces longitudinal compositional changes in the fecal microbiota</title><p>Collection of fecal pellets from the same mouse before and after indomethacin treatment allowed analysis of within-individual compositional changes over time (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3A</xref>).

The influence of indomethacin was not due to changes in microbial biomasses, since there were no significant changes in 16S rRNA gene copy number between PEG400 and indomethacin groups, as measured by qPCR (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3B</xref>). There may be a vehicle-induced decrease in microbial biomass, likely due to its purgative effect.

The total area-under-the-curve (AUC<sub>total</sub>) of indomethacin, which is a measurement of total drug exposure, was decreased by 16.8% in antibiotic-treated mice (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4E</xref>). The half-life (t<sub>1/2</sub>) of indomethacin was decreased by 37.5% (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4F</xref>), and the apparent volume of distribution (V<sub>d</sub>) of indomethacin was decreased by 46.1% (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4G</xref>) in antibiotic-treated mice. The variances of AUC<sub>total</sub>, t<sub>1/2</sub> and V<sub>d</sub> of indomethacin were significantly smaller in antibiotic-treated mice than in control mice (p=0.01 for AUC<sub>total</sub>, p=0.04 for t<sub>1/2</sub>, and p=0.006 for V<sub>d</sub>, F test), suggesting intestinal bacteria as one of the sources of inter-mouse variation in response to indomethacin.</p><p>A second set of age and gender matched mice treated with or without the antibiotic cocktail were administered 10 mg/kg indomethacin by gavage on day 5, and urine and feces were collected for the following 24 hr. Detection of indomethacin and indomethacin-glucuronide was confirmed by incubating samples with or without β-glucuronidase. As shown in the representative spectra (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5s1">Figure 5—figure supplement 1A</xref>), after incubation with β-glucuronidase, the peak of indomethacin glucuronide was diminished and that of indomethacin greatly increased. This change was detected in each of the samples studied (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5s1">Figure 5—figure supplement 1B,C</xref>). To evaluate enzyme activity, we compared the ratio of indomethacin-glucuronide to indomethacin in mice pretreated with or without the antibiotic cocktail. In urine, the ratio was significantly higher in antibiotic-treated mice for the first 12 hr following indomethacin administration (93.3% higher at 4 hr, 55.6% higher at 8 hr, 43.4% at 12 hr; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5B</xref>). In feces, indomethacin-glucuronide was barely detectable in control mice, yet was readily detected in antibiotic-treated mice (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5C</xref>). Indomethacin suppressed urinary prostanoid metabolites irrespective of treatment with the antibiotic cocktail (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5D</xref>). In control mice, indomethacin reduced these metabolites in a time-dependent fashion. A similar pattern was evident for PGD-M and PGI-M in antibiotic-treated mice. However, concentrations of the most abundant prostanoids, PGE-M and Tx-M, were suppressed to a lesser degree by indomethacin, and their concentration started to recover faster in antibiotic-treated mice compared to control mice. Evidently β-glucuronidase-catalyzed de-glucuronidation was impaired due to antibiotic-treatment, partially suppressing the inhibitory effect of indomethacin on COX enzymes. Thus, the intestinal microbiota influences the disposition and efficacy of indomethacin in the host, at least in part by regulating its de-glucuronidation and reabsorption from the intestine.<fig-group><fig id="fig5" position="float"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.08973.016</object-id><label>Figure 5.</label><caption><title>Metabolism and efficacy of indomethacin in antibiotic-treated mice are altered.</title><p>Upon the cessation of 5-day treatment with antibiotic cocktail (Abx, neomycin and vancomycin) or control water (Con), mice were administered by gavage with 10 mg/kg indomethacin.

We documented a bidirectional interaction — indomethacin altered the composition of the intestinal microbiota, and the intestinal microbiota altered indomethacin metabolism. The presence of intestinal bacteria boosted the circulating concentrations of indomethacin, which resulted in measurable changes in prostaglandin metabolism. Apparently, bacterial-encoded de-gluconuridation enzymes deconjugated the indomethacin-gluconuride catabolic intermediate to allow indomethacin recycling.</p><p>We showed that only a single oral dose of indomethacin was sufficient to perturb the intestinal microbiota, specifically within the cecum, LI and feces. Drug-induced effects were less evident in the SI, possibly attributable to higher inter-individual variance in composition (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1A</xref>) which limits the ability to detect the impact of interventions. The selected dose of indomethacin resulted in systemic drug exposure, including detection in luminal contents, along the mucosa of the SI and LI, and in plasma, urine and feces. Reflective of its mechanism of analgesic and anti-inflammatory action, this dose of indomethacin suppressed endogenous biosynthesis of prostaglandins derived primarily from COX-1 (PGD<sub>2</sub> and Tx) and COX-2 (PGI<sub>2</sub> and PGE<sub>2</sub>) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib57">McAdam et al., 1999</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib67">Ricciotti and FitzGerald, 2011</xref>), as reflected by urinary excretion of their major metabolites. It also resulted in intestinal damage, reminiscent of the upper and lower GI complications induced by NSAIDs in humans (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Allison et al., 1992</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib72">Smale et al., 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib75">Sostres et al., 2013</xref>).</p><p>The alterations in the intestinal microbiota induced by indomethacin — specifically expansion of pro-inflammatory bacteria — may have functional consequences. For example, indomethacin induces expansion of <italic>Erysipelotrichaceae</italic> in LI mucosa. This Gram-positive family of Firmicutes has been associated with parenteral nutrition-induced liver injury (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">Harris et al., 2014</xref>), obesity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib90">Zhang et al., 2009</xref>), colorectal cancer (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib94">Zhu et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Chen et al., 2012</xref>), and Crohn’s disease (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">Kaakoush et al., 2015</xref>). Indomethacin also induced pro-inflammatory shifts in the composition of fecal microbiota, for example, a significantly increased ratio of Firmicutes to Bacteroidetes. This shift has been previously reported in genetically obese mice (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib46">Ley et al., 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib82">Turnbaugh et al., 2006</xref>), obese children (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Bervoets et al., 2013</xref>), and obese adults (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib47">Ley et al., 2006</xref>). A decrease of <italic>S24-7</italic>, a family of Bacteroidetes, such as induced here by indomethacin, has been observed in a mouse model of colorectal cancer (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib48">Liang et al., 2014</xref>) and in mice with high fat diet-induced obesity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Evans et al., 2014</xref>). <italic>Lachnospiraceae</italic>, also increased following indomethacin administration, have been associated with lupus (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib91">Zhang et al., 2014</xref>), drug-induced liver toxicity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib88">Xu et al., 2015</xref>) and the development of obesity and diabetes in genetically susceptible mice (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">Kameyama and Itoh, 2014</xref>). While the importance of many of these observations remains to be established, they do suggest possible mechanisms of adverse health consequences.</p><p>The observed influence of PEG400, the vehicle used in our acute dosing study, on intestinal microbiota was not surprising. PEG used in bowel preparation in humans has been reported to have an effect on microbial diversity and composition (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Harrell et al., 2012</xref>). PEG binds water and prevents absorption in the large intestine, and so may hydrate the LI microbiome or flush upstream bacteria to downstream sites. However, our comparative study design allowed us to detect indomethacin effects independently of vehicle effects.</p><p>Despite the PEG effect, a number of compositional changes quantified in the acute study were reproduced in the chronic treatment study. Expansion of <italic>Peptococcaceae</italic> and <italic>Erysipelotrichaceae</italic> in the GI tract and <italic>Ruminococcus</italic> and <italic>Anearoplasma</italic> in feces were seen in both studies. Whether and how these strains contribute to indomethacin-induced GI toxicity is unclear and warrants further study. Several changes in the microbiota observed in the acute study were not detected in the chronic study, which could be due to their involvement in the initial response only, or due to gradual recovery of the intestinal microbiota during chronic drug exposure. Systemic exposure to indomethacin was also reduced to insure tolerability in the chronic dosing study.</p><p>The influence of indomethacin on the LI microbiota may be clinically important, since indomethacin causes complications in the lower GI tract with a similar incidence as in the upper GI tract (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib75">Sostres et al., 2013</xref>). The patients receiving indomethacin were reported to show increased large intestinal permeability (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib79">Suenaert et al., 2003</xref>), colonic ulceration and bleeding (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib63">Oren and Ligumsky, 1994</xref>), multiple colonic perforations (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib52">Loh et al., 2011</xref>), and hemorrhage (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib43">Langman et al., 1985</xref>). Compositional changes in LI microbiota associated with indomethacin administration may be involved in inflammatory processes directly in the lower GI tract, and might also affect the upper GI tract indirectly. For example, metabolic products produced by the LI microbiota may modify the local environment or enter the circulation, hence changing inter-bacterial interactions or host physiology at other sites including the SI.</p><p>Here, we provide pharmacokinetic evidence that indomethacin metabolism is influenced by intestinal bacteria — specifically, antibiotic suppression of intestinal bacteria significantly reduced the level of its de-glucuronidation. In the absence of bacterial de-gluconuronidation, indomethacin reabsorption into the circulation was reduced, resulting in increased elimination, a shortened half-life and reduced drug exposure. Concomitantly, indomethacin-induced suppression of PGE<sub>2</sub> and Tx was attenuated in microbiota-depleted mice, suggesting a reduction in indomethacin efficacy resulting from the loss of intestinal bacteria. The reduction in drug exposure due to antibiotic treatment may also explain the attenuated enteropathy associated with indomethacin in rats pretreated with antibiotics (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib41">Koga et al., 1999</xref>), and further support previous reports from Boelsterli and colleagues (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib70">Saitta et al., 2014</xref>), which reported that a small molecule inhibitor of bacterial β-glucuronidase were protective against NSAID-induced ulcerations in small intestine.</p><p>Indomethacin shows considerable inter-individual variation in pharmacokinetics, efficacy and risk of GI complications (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Brune, 1985</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">1987</xref>) that is not explained by human genetic variation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib59">Nakajima et al., 1998</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib56">Martin et al., 2001</xref>). Our finding that depletion of intestinal bacteria significantly reduced inter-mouse variability of half-life, volume of distribution, and drug exposure suggests bacteria-mediated metabolism as a source of variation in drug response. Given that multiple human intestinal bacteria encode β-glucuronidase genes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Dabek et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Gloux et al., 2011</xref>) and that the intestinal microbiota are variable amongst individuals (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib85">Wu et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Arumugam et al., 2011</xref>), differences in bacteria-mediated metabolism provide a reasonable explanation for inter-individual differences in indomethacin pharmacokinetics (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Brune, 1985</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">1987</xref>).</p><p>The pharmacokinetics of orally dosed indomethacin shows circadian variation both in humans and in rats, which may also reflect a contribution from the microbiota. A prolonged apparent half-life of indomethacin was observed in patients dosed in the evening compared to those dosed in the morning or at noon (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Guissou et al., 1983</xref>), accompanied by fewer undesirable effects (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib45">Levi et al., 1985</xref>). We and others have shown that the intestinal microbial load and composition varies during the day-night cycle (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib81">Thaiss et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib89">Zarrinpar et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib49">Liang et al., 2015</xref>), including strains bearing β-glucuronidase activity. Taken together with our findings here, intra-individual variation of the intestinal microbiota during the 24-hr light-dark cycle may contribute to indomethacin chronopharmacology.</p><p>In summary, a single oral dose of indomethacin elicited changes in composition and diversity of the microbiota. Reciprocally, the intestinal microbiota influenced indomethacin metabolism and its effectiveness as a systemic prostaglandin inhibitor. These results suggest that a dynamic interplay with the intestinal microbiome may contribute to adverse effects and variability in efficacy of indomethacin and perhaps other drugs.</p></sec><sec id="s4" sec-type="materials|methods"><title>Materials and methods</title><sec id="s4-1"><title>Animals</title><p>All C57BL/6 mice were purchased from the Jackson Laboratory and housed in our animal facility for at least 2 weeks before the performance of experiments.

Individual stock solutions of each compound (100 ng/µl) were prepared in ACN and stored at −80°C. Working solutions were prepared by mixing equal amounts of corresponding stock solutions and performing serial dilutions with ACN. Seven-point calibration samples (0, 0.032, 0.16, 0.8, 4, 20 and 100 ng/µl) for indomethacin and its metabolite were prepared. One large urine sample was obtained from mice without exposure to indomethacin. For each sample, 40 µl of (1 ng/µl) d4-Indomethacin (Santa Cruz Biotechnology, Dallas, TexasTX, USA), 10 µl calibration standards were added to 20 mouse urine. The calibration curves were also prepared with β-Glucuronidase hydrolysis.

The Mass Spectrometer was connected to a Thermo Scientific Accela HPLC Systems and equipped with a PAL auto sampler and thermocontroller (set at 4°C). The CSH C18 Column (2.1 mm Xx 150 mm, 130Å, 1.7 µm, Waters) was used at a constant 40°C. The mobile phase (A) (90% H<sub>2</sub>O/10% (B), 0.2% acetic acid) and mobile (B) (90% ACN/10% methanol) was used at a flow rate of 350 μl/min with a binary gradient (0–12 min, 10–50% B; 12–12.5 min, 50–100% B; 12.5–16 min, 100% B; 16.2–20 min, 10% B). Mass spectrometry was performed in negative mode. The transition for Indomethacin and d4-Indomethacin are 355.9&gt;311.9 and 359.9&gt;315.9, respectively. The transition for acyl-β-D-glucuronide Indomethacin is 533.1&gt;193.3. Both Q1 and Q3 were operated at 0.7 m/z FWHM. Peak area ratios of target analytes to d4-Indomethacin internal standards were calculated by Xcalibur Quan software. The data were fitted to the calibration curves to calculate the precise relative amount of indomethacin metabolites.</p><p>Prostanoid metabolites were measured using a Waters Acquity UPLC system comprising a binary pump, an autosampler, and a Xevo TQ-S triple quadrupole mass spectrometer equipped with an electrospray ionization source (Waters, Milford, MA, USA). Chromatographic separation was performed on a Waters UPLC CSH C18 column (2.1 mm x 150 mm, 130 Å, 1.7 µm). The UPLC mobile phases consisted of (A) (95%H2O/5% (B), pH=5.7) and (B) 95%ACN/5% methanol. The initial gradient began with 0% B. Mobile phase B increased linearly to 10% at 17 min, to 10.5% at 17.5 min, to 11.5% at 32 min, to 20% at 35 min, to 43% at 43 min, to 100% at 43.5 min, and finally go back to 0% at 45.5 min. A 0.35 ml/min flow rate was used throughout the UPLC gradient. The autosampler temperature was set at 4°C and the UPLC column was heated at 50°C. The MS was operated under negative ion mode at MRM mode. The transitions were monitored as previously described (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib73">Song et al., 2007</xref>). Briefly, systemic production of PGI<sub>2</sub>, PGE<sub>2</sub>, PGD<sub>2</sub>, and TxB<sub>2</sub> was determined by quantifying their major urinary metabolites: 2, 3-dinor 6-keto PGF<sub>1α</sub> (PGI-M); 7-hydroxy-5, 11-diketotetranorprostane-1, 16-dioic acid (PGE-M); 11, 15-dioxo-9<sub>α-</sub>hydroxy-2, 3, 4, 5-tetranorprostan-1, 20-dioic acid (tetranor PGD-M); and 2, 3-dinor TxB<sub>2</sub> (Tx-M), respectively. esults were normalized with creatinine (Oxford Biomedical Research, Rochester Hills, MI, USA).

Your submission has been reviewed by Fiona Watt (Senior Editor) and three reviewers, one of whom is a member of our Board of Reviewing Editors.</p><p>Summary:</p><p>Investigations of the effects of NSAIDs, such as indomethacin on the gut microbiota, and the role of the microbiota in drug pharmacokinetics are significant and impactful questions for studies of the microbiome. While all three reviewers found the topic of your manuscript interesting and innovative, they all expressed major concerns about the findings and their interpretation and contextualization. Furthermore, the reviewers expressed that substantial revision would be required for reconsideration.</p><p>Essential revisions:</p><p>Major concerns reflected in the reviewers' comments below spanned the dosage of indomethacin and the selection of study time points, the 16S analysis and its findings given the large effect of the vehicle, and the underexploration experimentally and discussion regarding how a drug that mediates SI injury results in broader biogeographical shifts, e.g. LI microbiome.</p><p><italic>Reviewer #1:</italic></p><p>While the field and topic are appropriate for <italic>eLife</italic> and represent a strong effort to coordinate biogeographical data with reciprocal effects between the microbiota and the host (a field that is becoming a scientific topic of increasing), there are several concerns regarding the methodology and interpretation of this work.</p><p>The major concerns relate to experimental design [the dosage of indomethacin and the time points selected in this study (6h) that are used to describe the work as longitudinal]. Please justify the choice to use of such a traumatic dosage, rather than a dosage, more relevant to the use of the drug for therapeutic/symptom management purposes given the goal of the study to use mouse models to mechanistically unravel host-microbe-drug interaction in humans.</p><p>Further, given the changes that occur in the microbiome over dietary, circadian cycles, etc, a longer timeframe would provide more relevant information as to the effects of indomethacin on the microbiota. Ideally, the experiments in this study would be performed over a time-period of weeks with sub-inflammatory dosages of indomethacin and include such temporal data.</p><p>Specific points:</p><p>1) Please explain/consider choice of V1-V2 for 16S rRNA gene survey sequencing over V3-V4 as per Earth Microbiome project standards.</p><p>2) Add percentage variation explained to PCoA figure.</p><p>3) Results, paragraph two seem unclear/unsupported by data in the proximal LI.</p><p>4) Results, paragraph six: Confirmation by qPCR or another method like FISH would strengthen this section.</p><p>5) Given that the damage occurs in the SI, more weight should be given to the effect on the LI microbiota in the Discussion. Why might these changes occur here? Are there testable hypotheses that can be generated?</p><p>6) Are the fecal data in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2</xref> the same as the data used in the 'longitudinal' study in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3</xref>? Please clarify/combine to avoid repetition of data.</p><p>7) In the 'longitudinal' studies (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3</xref>), it almost seems more like the indomethacin treated mice were 'abnormal' at t=0 rather than differing from untreated controls at t=6h. Please clarify the selection of data to compare for statistical purposes.</p><p><italic>Reviewer #2:</italic></p><p>Liang and colleagues present a manuscript rich with data, but unfortunately, lacking a primer. While there is a wealth of information contained within this manuscript, it lacks scholarly context, a disservice to the quantity of data contained therein. The reader would be well served if the authors would provide a context for each experiment carried out. Moreover, the text contains many outdated citations and contains many typos, which would benefit from editing. Most importantly, this manuscript contains a lack of synthesis and interpretation of the data.</p><p>Specific criticism:</p><p>1) The Introduction contains citations from as far back as 1977, and neglects to cite contemporary work such as that by Boelsterli and colleagues. More contemporary citations should be referenced in both Introduction and Discussion.</p><p>2) The authors should include a brief description of jargon such as &quot;Shannon index&quot; etc. which are familiar to those within the field only, and not a broad audience.</p><p>3) What are the clinical implications of these findings? This should be addressed in the Discussion section. Does concurrent treatment with antibiotics impact the efficacy or the side effects of (chronic or acute) NSAID treatment? A literature review may answer this question, which should be incorporation within the Discussion.</p><p>4) In general, NSAID-mediated injury is observed in the small intestine. What is the significance of finding an expansion of <italic>Erysipelotrichaceae</italic> in the large intestinal mucosa?</p><p>5) <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3A</xref> has some issues: the authors mention separate clusters forming in the indomethacin group however they are not apparent in the figure, which looks like fully overlapping blue and black circles. Similarly, what is the significance of the two main clusters observed in the PEG-400 treated group? The black and blue points seem to be overlapping in all instances. Please clarify.</p><p>6) Can the authors comment on why indomethacin would upregulate the <italic>Ruminococceae</italic> spp? In a similar vein, the authors could comment on why PEG-400 may upregulate other species.</p><p>7) Supplemental figures: some are missing labels (e.g the histology image lacks any captions).</p><p>8) The authors should spend more time describing <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4</xref>, which contains very important information. The authors have &quot;addressed the hypothesis&quot; but not actually made a conclusion, nor correlated with how this impacts treatment regimens with NSAIDs (see comment #3). An allusion is made towards this in paragraph four of the Discussion, but a deeper discussion is warranted.</p><p>9) The authors find that perturbations in intestinal microbiota specifically occur in cecum, large intestine and feces; however, the bulk of assault by NSAIDs occurs in the small intestine, as clearly demonstrated by at least three papers by Boelsterli and colleagues on NSAID damage and its alleviation. How do compositional changes in the more distal portion of the GI tract impact pathology more proximally?</p><p>10) What is the substance being measured in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5s1">Figure 5—figure supplement 1A</xref>?</p><p>11) The authors note a depletion of 16S copy numbers and decrease in microbial diversity following antibiotic treatment, and an expansion of Proteobacteria. Do Proteobacteria impact GI toxicity of indomethacin and if so, how?</p><p>12) The suggestion that bacteria contain β-glucuronidases, along with one citation from Roberts et al. is not sufficient to connect this work with the well established data by Redinbo and coworkers showing not only that bacteria have β-glucuronidases, but that those enzymes are directly involved in NSAID-induced GI damage. Furthermore, they show that inhibiting those bacterial enzymes can reduce this damage.</p><p><italic>Reviewer #3</italic></p><p>Liang et al. present a series of studies testing the impact of the NSAID drug indomethacin on the gut microbiota as well as the role of the microbiota in drug pharmacokinetics. While I have concerns about the first claim, the latter finding is quite convincing and would be a nice addition to the literature. The major strengths of this paper are the large sample size, both in terms of animals and locations within the gut, and the pharmacokinetic analyses. The manuscript is clearly written and the figures are easy to read.</p><p>1) The 16S analyses could be improved. As is, I'm not convinced that the drug changed the gut microbiota much more than the vehicle (which seems to have had a large effect).</p><p><xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2B,C</xref> show some differences in α-diversity, but they are either inconsistent between lumen vs. tissue samples, inconsistent between observed OTUs and the Shannon index (both of which measure species richness, so they should match), small magnitude, or restricted to a small number of gut locations.</p><p><xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2D</xref> is intriguing, but it's unclear how this taxon was found. Were the FDR values corrected for all taxa at this level or just for the different locations?</p><p><xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2E</xref> may be significant relative to vehicle but is not significantly different from the untreated animals, raising questions as to its biological relevance.</p><p>In <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3A</xref> the authors state that the indomethacin treated animals cluster by timepoint but is not supported by the current color labels. The only clear clustering is for the vehicle but this doesn't seem to group by timepoint (there's no mention of the reason – could this be due to housing?). It's also unclear why the groups were all presented separately, instead of testing if the drug changed the gut microbiota relative to the control treatments and baseline samples.</p><p>In <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3B</xref> the vehicle/drug groups are slightly lower before treatment – what is the explanation for this?</p><p><xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3C-E</xref> is used to conclude that many taxa are significantly affected by the drug in fecal samples, raising the question as to why these weren't found in the previous analysis of colon contents. The same concern about FDR correction (see 2D above) applies here. Also, nearly all of these taxa are similar in the 3 treatment groups after treatment – the significance appears to be due to a difference in drug treated group at the baseline timepoint before treatment. While I appreciate the idea of using each mouse as its own control, the consistency of these differences at the baseline timepoint causes me to worry about what might have been different between the mice assigned to each treatment group.</p><p>A more general issue is that many of the 16S comparisons are qualitative and lack proper statistical tests. For example, Results, paragraph two includes many statements that need to be backed up by statistics. It would also help to include numbers in the text to give the reader a sense of the magnitude of each change and the variance within each group.</p><p>2) The data in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4</xref> is excellent and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5C</xref> is particularly striking. Together, they show the importance of the gut microbiota in the pharmacokinetics of indomethacin. However, I have some concerns as to the novelty of this finding. As the authors mention in the Results section, Saitta et al., 2014 already conclusively showed that bacterial β-glucuronidase contributes to the GI damage caused by indomethacin. While it is very comforting to confirm that this is due to deconjugation its not that big a step forward.</p><p>A bigger advance would be to support the authors' hypothesis that changes in the gut microbiota following drug treatment then alters drug levels or side effects. This might be done by doing transplantation experiments into germ-free mice from donors that were treated with indomethacin or vehicle controls followed by drug treatment. Better yet, maybe some of the putative drug-associated taxa that the authors have identified could be used to colonize germ-free or antibiotic treated mice prior to indomethacin treatment. It would also be possible to quantify the abundance of β-glucuronidase pre- and post-treatment by quantitative PCR, enzymatic assays, or metagenomic shotgun sequencing.</p><p>3) I'm not sure what the &quot;tissue&quot; microbiota represents as microbes are typically found in the lumen and outer mucosal layer with very few penetrating the tissue in wild-type animals. More information is needed in the Materials and methods section to explain the sample collection procedure. How was the lumen washed away? Was the mucus retained prior to homogenization?</p></body></sub-article><sub-article article-type="reply" id="SA2"><front-stub><article-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.08973.023</article-id><title-group><article-title>Author response</article-title></title-group></front-stub><body><p> <italic>Essential revisions:</italic></p><p><italic>Major concerns reflected in the reviewers' comments below spanned the dosage of indomethacin and the selection of study time points, the 16S analysis and its findings given the large effect of the vehicle, and the underexploration experimentally and discussion regarding how a drug that mediates SI injury results in broader biogeographical shifts, e.g. LI microbiome.</italic></p><p>In response to essential revisions from the editor:</p><p>1) The dose of indomethacin was selected for the following reasons:</p><p>According to FDA guidance, a dose of 10mg/Kg body weight in mice is equivalent to 0.81mg/Kg body weight in humans (48.8 mg for a 60 Kg human). This is a dosage that is commonly used for treating acute pain as well as rheumatoid arthritis and osteoarthritis. This dose is also widely used in experimental animal models to induce intestinal damage (Fukumoto et al. 2011, Tanigawa et al. 2013).</p><p>At this dose, indomethacin successfully inhibits both COX-1 and COX-2 enzymes in vivo, as indicated by the significantly reduced urinary prostaglandin metabolite levels. This information was provided in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s2">Figure 2—figure supplement 2</xref>. This dose has been shown in our study as well as in previous reports to induce small intestinal lesions. Our data are provided in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s1">Figure 2—figure supplement 1</xref>.</p><p>In our chronic treatment experiment, 20 ppm of indomethacin was provided in the diet. For an adult mouse weighing 25g and eating 4g per day, this amounts to 3.2mg/Kg/day. This dose was chosen based on previous reports showing suppression of prostanoids by indomethacin (Chiu et al. 2000, Leibowitz et al. 2014, Fjaere et al. 2014). This dose equivalent is less than the acute dosing regimen to ensure tolerability and regulatory compliance. The reasons for the doses chosen are now specified more clearly in the revised manuscript.</p><p>2) The 6-hour treatment was selected for the following reasons:</p><p>Six hours is approximately the half-life of indomethacin in rodents. Six hours post dose is before the appearance of indomethacin induced lesions; therefore it allows us to study the potential role of gut microbiota in the development of indomethacin-induced intestinal damage. The lesions in the small intestine were detected at 24 hours. Hence, analysis at 6 hours post treatment excluded potential lesion-induced changes in microbial composition. These reasons are now spelled out more clearly in the revised manuscript.</p><p>3) 16S rRNA gene sequencing—effects of vehicle and choice of the V1-V2 window:</p><p>The vehicle used in the acute studies did have a notable effect. PEG was needed to solubilize indomethacin for the acute dosing studies, but PEG is also a component of lavage mixtures used for bowel preps in human patients and so strongly affects the microbes present. Here the PEG treatment resulted in softer pellets and altered microbiota. Use of PEG alone as a control indicates an impact of indomethacin over and above the vehicle effect in the acute dosing study. In the long-term dosing study, PEG was not used and some of the same bacterial compositional changes were observed despite lower systemic indomethacin exposure, again consistent with both PEG and indomethacin affecting microbial composition.</p><p>Regarding the choice of the V1-V2 region of the 16S rRNA gene for sequencing, this region has been found to yield good partitioning in sample sets from many different control studies and experiments in the laboratories of Gordon, Knight, Bushman and others (Liu et al. 2007, Chakravorty et al. 2007, Wu et al. 2010). All 16S sequence windows used for analysis recover reads from some bacteria better than others. For example, the V1-V2 window is known to be biased against Bifidobacteria, but this group is not commonly seen in the mouse fecal microbiome. We thus feel that the V1-V2 region is a reasonable choice here. We have added discussion of these points to the revised manuscript.</p><p>4) The link between small intestinal injury and microbial shifts in the large intestine:</p><p>Although we didn’t reveal statistically significant changes in bacterial communities residing in the small intestine (SI), this doesn’t necessarily allow us to conclude that indomethacin is not influencing the SI microbiota. As indicated in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1</xref>, SI microbiota express greater variability among individuals than in the large intestine (LI), which may mask indomethacin-induced compositional changes.</p><p>Indomethacin also causes damage in the lower GI tract. Significantly increased large intestinal permeability (Suenaert et al. 2003), colonic ulceration and bleeding (Oren, Ligumsky 1994), multiple colonic perforations (Loh et al. 2011) and hemorrhage (Langman et al. 1985) have been reported in patients receiving indomethacin. Evidence suggests that incidence of upper and lower GI complications induced by NSAIDs are similar (Sostres et al. 2013). Compositional changes in the large intestine induced by indomethacin may be involved in these inflammatory processes as well.</p><p>The intestinal bacteria are constantly interacting with other species and with the host, in part through the metabolites they synthesize. Altered bacterial populations may secrete molecules that modify the local environment or enter the circulation, hence changing inter-bacterial interactions or host physiology, possibly influencing pathogenesis of intestinal lesions. Possible mechanisms are the topic of ongoing study – whether microbial populations are involved mechanistically in intestinal injury is unclear. We now spell this out in the revised manuscript.</p><p>Reviewer #1:</p><p> <italic>While the field and topic are appropriate for eLife and represent a strong effort to coordinate biogeographical data with reciprocal effects between the microbiota and the host (a field that is becoming a scientific topic of increasing), there are several concerns regarding the methodology and interpretation of this work. The major concerns relate to experimental design [the dosage of indomethacin and the time points selected in this study (6h) that are used to describe the work as longitudinal]. Please justify the choice to use of such a traumatic dosage, rather than a dosage, more relevant to the use of the drug for therapeutic/symptom management purposes given the goal of the study to use mouse models to mechanistically unravel host-microbe-drug interaction in humans. Further, given the changes that occur in the microbiome over dietary, circadian cycles, etc, a longer timeframe would provide more relevant information as to the effects of indomethacin on the microbiota. Ideally, the experiments in this study would be performed over a time-period of weeks with sub-inflammatory dosages of indomethacin and include such temporal data.</italic></p><p>We appreciate the reviewer’s comments on the experimental design, including dose selection, time point selection, and rationale for using V1-V2 region of 16S rRNA gene. These points are addressed above.</p><p>We agree that the influence of long-term indomethacin treatment on microbial composition is an important issue, so following the reviewer’s comment we conducted an additional experiment where mice received a control diet or indomethacin in the diet (20 ppm) for 7 days. The data and interpretation are presented in the revised manuscript. Chronic treatment also induced the expansion of <italic>Peptococcaceae</italic> and <italic>Erysipelotrichaceae</italic> in the GI tract and <italic>Ruminococcus</italic> and <italic>Anearoplasma</italic> in the feces, consistent with previous results from the study of acute treatment. Evidently these genera responded to indomethacin both in the initial phase and in the longer term. We also observed that several acute treatment-induced changes were less significant in the long-term dosing study. It could be that these changes are involved in the initial response only, or that the temporal variation overrides the drug-induced changes. Additional possibilities include the differing magnitude of systemic drug exposure, the methods of drug delivery, and non-identical microbiota in mice at the start of the experiment. Further studies, outside the scope of this manuscript, will address these possibilities.</p><p> <italic>Specific points: 1) Please explain/consider choice of V1-V2 for 16S rRNA gene survey sequencing over V3-V4 as per Earth Microbiome project standards.</italic></p><p>The use of the V1-V2 16S rRNA gene for sequencing is justified under Essential Revisions comment #3 above.</p><p> <italic>2) Add percentage variation explained to PCoA figure.</italic></p><p>The percentage variation has been added to the axes on each PCoA plot as requested.</p><p> <italic>3) Results, paragraph two seem unclear/unsupported by data in the proximal LI.</italic></p><p>These are now supported with numerical data.</p><p> <italic>4) Results, paragraph six: Confirmation by qPCR or another method like FISH would strengthen this section.</italic></p><p>We agree with the reviewer that changes in bacterial abundance would be strengthened by conformation with other methods. As mentioned above, we have replicated key compositional changes seen in the acute study in the newly added long term dosing study.</p><p> <italic>5) Given that the damage occurs in the SI, more weight should be given to the effect on the LI microbiota in the Discussion. Why might these changes occur here? Are there testable hypotheses that can be generated?</italic></p><p>Discussion on microbial shifts in LI and damage in SI are provided under Essential Revisions comment #4 above as well as in the revised Discussion.</p><p><italic>6) Are the fecal data in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2</xref> the same as the data used in the 'longitudinal' study in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3</xref>? Please clarify/combine to avoid repetition of data.</italic></p><p>The fecal data presented in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figures 2</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">3</xref> are overlapping but are not repeats. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2</xref> illustrates the geographic changes caused by indomethacin treatment after 6 hours across three groups. The fecal microbiota was considered as an extension of the luminal intestinal microbiota, hence provided as part of this analysis. However, since this is cross-sectional analysis, only 6h fecal data are presented in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2</xref>. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3</xref>, on the other hand, illustrates the temporal changes in fecal microbiota within each individual mouse by comparing microbial composition prior to (0h) and post (6h) indomethacin treatment in individual groups. Therefore, the fecal microbiota data were not repeats.</p><p> <italic>7) In the 'longitudinal' studies (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3</xref>), it almost seems more like the indomethacin treated mice were 'abnormal' at t=0 rather than differing from untreated controls at t=6h. Please clarify the selection of data to compare for statistical purposes.</italic></p><p>We agree with the reviewer that at t = 0h, there were differences between treated mice and control mice. It is well known that there is large inter-individual variation in intestinal microbiota composition. We randomized allocation of the mice to each group and importantly controlled for cage effects as a part of the statistical analysis. We are comparing within-individual changes due to indomethacin changes, so each individual serves as their own control, lending more support to our conclusion.</p><p>Reviewer #2:</p><p> <italic>Liang and colleagues present a manuscript rich with data, but unfortunately, lacking a primer. While there is a wealth of information contained within this manuscript, it lacks scholarly context, a disservice to the quantity of data contained therein. The reader would be well served if the authors would provide a context for each experiment carried out. Moreover, the text contains many outdated citations and contains many typos, which would benefit from editing. Most importantly, this manuscript contains a glaring lack of synthesis and interpretation of the data, which is the main reason this reviewer is not keen on accepting the manuscript as is.</italic></p><p>We appreciated the reviewer’s comments on the language and citations, and have revised the manuscript extensively in response.</p><p> <italic>Specific criticism: 1) The Introduction contains citations from as far back as 1977, and neglects to cite contemporary work such as that by Boelsterli and colleagues. More contemporary citations should be referenced in both Introduction and Discussion.</italic></p><p>In the revised manuscript we’ve cited the work of Boelsterli and others in the Introduction and Discussion.</p><p> <italic>2) The authors should include a brief description of jargon such as &quot;Shannon index&quot; etc. which are familiar to those within the field only, and not a broad audience.</italic></p><p>We have added a brief description of the Shannon Index as requested.</p><p> <italic>3) What are the clinical implications of these findings? This should be addressed in the</italic> Discussion section<italic>. Does concurrent treatment with antibiotics impact the efficacy or the side effects of (chronic or acute) NSAID treatment? A literature review may answer this question, which should be incorporation within the Discussion.</italic></p><p>Clinical implications are now discussed more fully in the revised Discussion.</p><p> <italic>4) In general, NSAID-mediated injury is observed in the small intestine. What is the significance of finding an expansion of Erysipelotrichaceae in the large intestinal mucosa?</italic></p><p>We discussed the issue that changes were detected in colonic microbiota while damage was present in the small intestine in response to the editor under Essential Revisions comment #4 as well as in the revised Discussion. Expansion of <italic>Erysipelotrichaceae</italic> has been associated with parenteral nutrition induced liver injury, obesity, colorectal cancer, and Crohn’s disease, indicating a pro-inflammatory role of <italic>Erysipelotrichaceae</italic>. However, due to current lack of knowledge about these bacteria and their potential causality in these diseases, it is too early to conclude the significance of <italic>Erysipelotrichaceae</italic> expansion in indomethacin-induced GI toxicity.</p><p> <italic>5) <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3A</xref> has some issues: the authors mention separate clusters forming in the indomethacin group however they are not apparent in the figure, which looks like fully overlapping blue and black circles. Similarly, what is the significance of the two main clusters observed in the PEG-400 treated group? The black and blue points seem to be overlapping in all instances. Please clarify.</italic></p><p>In <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3A</xref>, we performed ADONIS test (Anderson 2001) over the weighted UniFrac distances to test the clustering of samples based on treatment, and the results were reported in the Results section.</p><p> <italic>6) Can the authors comment on why indomethacin would upregulate the Ruminococceae spp? In a similar vein, the authors could comment on why PEG-400 may upregulate other species.</italic></p><p>The reviewer asked for a possible explanation of the expansion of <italic>Ruminococceae spp</italic> upon indomethacin treatment as well as similar effects due to PEG-400 treatment. We think there could be multiple mechanisms by which xenobiotics cause compositional changes in gut microbiota, including those previously reported by others. One example would be the cross-feeding model. Certain commensal bacteria can directly consume xenobiotics and secrete metabolites into the environment, which may be used by other bacteria to boost their growth. Another example could be a host-dependent influence, where xenobiotics affect host characteristics (especially in the local environment of the intestine) and induce changes in immune regulation of gut bacteria. Chassaing and colleagues (Chassaing et al. 2015) reported that dietary emulsifiers, such as carboxymethylcellulose and polysorbate-80, altered microbial localization as well as OTU abundances. However, they didn’t establish the causal relationship between the localization and altered OTUs. Further studies are needed to understand the mechanism of xenobiotic-induced changes in bacteria.</p><p> <italic>7) Supplemental figures: some are missing labels (e.g the histology image lacks any captions).</italic></p><p>We have added captions for the histology images as requested.</p><p> <italic>8) The authors should spend more time describing <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4</xref>, which contains very important information. The authors have &quot;addressed the hypothesis&quot; but not actually made a conclusion, nor correlated with how this impacts treatment regimens with NSAIDs (see comment #3). An allusion is made towards this in paragraph four of the Discussion, but a deeper discussion is warranted.</italic></p><p>We have added more discussion on <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4</xref> in the Result and Discussion in the revised manuscript.</p><p> <italic>9) The authors find that perturbations in intestinal microbiota specifically occur in cecum, large intestine and feces; however, the bulk of assault by NSAIDs occurs in the small intestine, as clearly demonstrated by at least three papers by Boelsterli and colleagues on NSAID damage and its alleviation. How do compositional changes in the more distal portion of the GI tract impact pathology more proximally?</italic></p><p>Discussion on microbial shifts in LI and damages in SI are provided under No.4 above as well as in the revised Discussion.</p><p> <italic>10) What is the substance being measured in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5s1">Figure 5—figure supplement 1A</xref>?</italic></p><p>The substances being measured in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5s1">Figure 5—figure supplement 1A</xref> are labeled in each panel: Acyl-β-D-glucuronide Indomethacin in top panel; indomethacin in middle panel; and d4-indomethacin in bottom panel.</p><p> <italic>11) The authors note a depletion of 16S copy numbers and decrease in microbial diversity following antibiotic treatment, and an expansion of Proteobacteria. Do Proteobacteria impact GI toxicity of indomethacin and if so, how?</italic></p><p>The reviewer pointed out that the expansion of Proteobacteria following antibiotic treatment and questioned whether this would influence the GI toxicity of indomethacin. The antibiotic treatment model was set up to study the role of bacteria in indomethacin metabolism rather than GI toxicity, since the expansion of Proteobacteria was not caused by indomethacin treatment. Additionally, β – glucuronidase activity hasn’t been reported in Proteobacteria according to previous studies (Dabek et al. 2008, Gloux et al. 2011), hence it is not likely that these bacteria would influence the exposure of indomethacin in host. Therefore, current data do not support an influence of Proteobacteria in indomethacin-induced enteropathy.</p><p> <italic>12) The suggestion that bacteria contain</italic> β<italic>-glucuronidases, along with one citation from Roberts</italic> et al. <italic>is not sufficient to connect this work with the well established data by Redinbo and coworkers showing not only that bacteria have</italic> β</p><p><italic>-glucuronidases, but that those enzymes are directly involved in NSAID-induced GI damage. Furthermore, they show that inhibiting those bacterial enzymes can reduce this damage.</italic>We thank the reviewer for bringing up previous work by Redinbo and coworkers, which is now cited. However, our study is the first to link pharmacokinetics and pharmacodynamics, providing a bidirectional impact between intestinal microbiota and indomethacin.</p><p>Reviewer #3:</p><p> <italic>Liang</italic> et al.</p><p> <italic>present a series of studies testing the impact of the NSAID drug indomethacin on the gut microbiota as well as the role of the microbiota in drug pharmacokinetics. While I have concerns about the first claim (see below), the latter finding is quite convincing and would be a nice addition to the literature. The major strengths of this paper are the large sample size, both in terms of animals and locations within the gut, and the pharmacokinetic analyses. The manuscript is clearly written and the figures are easy to read. 1) The 16S analyses could be improved. As is, I'm not convinced that the drug changed the gut microbiota much more than the vehicle (which seems to have had a large effect).</italic></p><p>The reviewer was concerned about the effect of vehicle on the microbial composition. In our recently-conducted chronic treatment experiment, mice were given a control diet or indomethacin mixed in the diet (20 ppm) for 7 days—that is, the dosing was in the absence of the PEG carrier. The data and interpretation are presented in the revised manuscript. Briefly, the chronic treatment induced the expansion of <italic>Peptococcaceae</italic> and <italic>Erysipelotrichaceae</italic> in the GI tract and <italic>Ruminococcus</italic> and <italic>Anearoplasma</italic> in the feces, as in the acute treatment experiment, indicating these changes are independent of the vehicle effect. We also observed that several acute treatment-induced changes were less impressive in this chronic dosing study. This is addressed in the revised manuscript.</p><p><italic><xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2B,C</xref> show some differences in</italic> α<italic>-diversity, but they are either inconsistent between lumen vs. tissue samples, inconsistent between observed OTUs and the Shannon index (both of which measure species richness, so they should match), small magnitude, or restricted to a small number of gut locations.</italic></p><p>The reviewer pointed out that <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2B, C</xref> shows changes in α diversity along the GI tract that are different between luminal vs mucosal samples, and different between observed OTUs and Shannon index. The numbers of OTUs (richness) and diversity are not identical. Richness quantifies the number of types present, while diversity takes into account not just the number of types present but the evenness of distribution among individuals. The difference between luminal versus mucosal samples is not surprising and is consistent with published literature (Hill et al. 2010, Albenberg et al. 2014, Looft et al. 2014). The IBD literature emphasizes differences between luminal and mucosa microbiota (Carroll et al. 2011, Lavelle et al. 2015).</p><p><italic><xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2D</xref> is intriguing, but it's unclear how this taxon was found. Were the FDR values corrected for all taxa at this level or just for the different locations?</italic></p><p>In <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2D</xref>, the statistics were carried out for each GI location. Comparisons were made using the <italic>group_significance.py</italic> script with Kruskal-Wallis tests in QIIME analysis. This script allows the comparison of taxa frequencies across sample groups, and returns a p value corrected by the Benjamini-Hochberg FDR procedure for multiple comparisons.</p><p><italic><xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2E</xref> may be significant relative to vehicle but is not significantly different from the untreated animals, raising questions as to its biological relevance.</italic></p><p>We agree with the reviewer that in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2E</xref> indomethacin treatment was significant relative to vehicle. This still indicates a drug effect since indomethacin may counteract and reverse the vehicle effect. In our chronic treatment experiment, indomethacin induced expansion of <italic>Peptococcaceae</italic> and <italic>Erysipelotrichaceae</italic> in the GI tract significantly compared to control animals (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s5">Figure 2—figure supplement 5</xref>), indicating that these changes are independent of a vehicle effect.</p><p><italic>In <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3A</xref> the authors state that the indomethacin treated animals cluster by timepoint but is not supported by the current color labels. The only clear clustering is for the vehicle but this doesn't seem to group by timepoint (there's no mention of the reason – could this be due to housing?). It's also unclear why the groups were all presented separately, instead of testing if the drug changed the gut microbiota relative to the control treatments and baseline samples.</italic></p><p>In <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3A</xref>, the previous version reported PCoA plots using unweighted UniFrac distance. The separation in the PEG400 group was due to a cage effect, which is why we carefully controlled for cage effects in our statistical analysis. In the new version, however, we decided to use the weighted UniFrac distances, since we are discussing the changes in relative abundances of bacteria. We also performed ADONIS test (Anderson 2001) and found significant clustering of before and after treatment samples. These results were reported in the revised Results.</p><p><italic>In <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3B</xref> the vehicle/drug groups are slightly lower before treatment – what is the explanation for this?</italic></p><p>The reviewer also highlighted the reduction in 16S rRNA gene copy numbers in vehicle/drug group in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3B</xref>. We think that this is a vehicle effect, which is likely to be attributable to its purgative effect. One possible explanation could be that by retaining water, an effect of PEG, the bacterial community was diluted, leaving fewer bacteria per unit weight in fecal samples. Further studies are needed to understand the exact mechanisms.</p><p><italic><xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3C-E</xref> is used to conclude that many taxa are significantly affected by the drug in fecal samples, raising the question as to why these weren't found in the previous analysis of colon contents. The same concern about FDR correction (see 2D above) applies here. Also, nearly all of these taxa are similar in the 3 treatment groups after treatment – the significance appears to be due to a difference in drug treated group at the baseline timepoint before treatment. While I appreciate the idea of using each mouse as its own control, the consistency of these differences at the baseline timepoint causes me to worry about what might have been different between the mice assigned to each treatment group.</italic></p><p>In <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3C-E</xref>, comparisons and FDR corrections are conducted in the same way as for <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2D</xref>. One of the reasons why these taxa were not found in analysis of colon contents is probably due to the difference between longitudinal analyses versus cross-sectional analyses. In fecal microbiota analysis, each mouse serves as its own control so that the experimental design was controlled for various confounding factors such as inter-mouse variability and caging effects. Hence, the real biological changes due to the drug treatment are less likely to be masked by other variables. In contrast, in the colon content analysis, comparisons were made between different groups of mice so that inter-mouse variability and caging effect may mask the influences caused by drug treatment. The reviewer also pointed out the differences among mice before treatment. We were aware of inter-mouse variability, so we carefully randomized animals into three groups and randomly conducted treatment on different days. All experiments were carried out by the same individual following the same procedure to minimize technical variables. Therefore, the baseline difference among mice reflects biological variance. We now discuss this in the revised manuscript.</p><p><italic>A more general issue is that many of the 16S comparisons are qualitative and lack proper statistical tests. For example, Results, paragraph two includes many statements that need to be backed up by statistics. It would also help to include numbers in the text to give the reader a sense of the magnitude of each change and the variance within each group.</italic></p><p>As requested, we now provide more numeric data and statistical results in the revised manuscript.</p><p><italic>2) The data in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4</xref> is excellent and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5C</xref> is particularly striking. Together, they show the importance of the gut microbiota in the pharmacokinetics of indomethacin. However, I have some concerns as to the novelty of this finding. As the authors mention in the</italic> Results section<italic>, Saitta</italic> et al.<italic>, 2014 already conclusively showed that bacterial</italic> β<italic>-glucuronidase contributes to the GI damage caused by indomethacin. While it is very comforting to confirm that this is due to deconjugation its not that big a step forward.</italic></p><p>We agree that previous work has demonstrated the role of bacterial β-glucuronidase in GI damage by indomethacin. However, our study is the first to link pharmacokinetics and pharmacodynamics, providing a bi-directional impact between intestinal microbiota and indomethacin. Thus we highlight that bacteria may contribute to inter-individual variation in drug response among individuals. Given that the microbial composition undergoes circadian oscillation during the light-dark cycle, bacterial influence on pharmacokinetics may also explain intra-individual variation at various times of the day.</p><p><italic>A bigger advance would be to support the authors' hypothesis that changes in the gut microbiota following drug treatment then alters drug levels or side effects. This might be done by doing transplantation experiments into germ-free mice from donors that were treated with indomethacin or vehicle controls followed by drug treatment. Better yet, maybe some of the putative drug-associated taxa that the authors have identified could be used to colonize germ-free or antibiotic treated mice prior to indomethacin treatment. It would also be possible to quantify the abundance of</italic> β<italic>-glucuronidase pre- and post-treatment by quantitative PCR, enzymatic assays, or metagenomic shotgun sequencing.</italic></p><p>The reviewer pointed out that germ-free mouse would be a good model for further studies, including drug treatment and fecal transplantation experiments. We note that an advantage of using antibiotic treatments is that the mice studied will have developed normal gut and immune function by growth with normal colonization—gnotobiotic mice are known to be abnormal in these respects. Still, gnotobiotic studies would be a good addition. Unfortunately, during the study we did not have access to gnotobiotic mice. But these are on our list of future studies. In addition, we were especially interested to use antibiotics given the commonality of co-administration of NSAIDs and antibiotics, especially to orthopedic patients.</p><p><italic>3) I'm not sure what the &quot;tissue&quot; microbiota represents as microbes are typically found in the lumen and outer mucosal layer with very few penetrating the tissue in wild-type animals. More information is needed in the Materials and methods section to explain the sample collection procedure. How was the lumen washed away? Was the mucus retained prior to homogenization?</italic></p><p>We have explained the luminal and mucosal sample collection procedure more carefully in the revised Materials and methods session.</p></body></sub-article></article>
