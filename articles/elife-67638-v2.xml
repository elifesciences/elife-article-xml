distress of others in humans and some social animals, but the neural mechanisms underlying this behavior are not well characterized. By using socially monogamous mandarin voles, we found that optogenetic or chemogenetic inhibition of 5-HTergic neurons in the dorsal raphe nucleus (DR) or optogenetic inhibition of serotonin (5-HT) terminals in the anterior cingulate cortex (ACC) significantly decreased allogrooming time in the consolation test and reduced sociability in the three-chamber test. The release of 5-HT within the ACC and the activity of DR neurons were significantly increased during allogrooming, sniffing, and social approaching. Finally, we found that the activation of 5-HT1A receptors in the ACC was sufficient to reverse consolation and sociability deficits induced by the chemogenetic inhibition of 5-HTergic neurons in the DR. Our study provided the first direct evidence that DR-ACC 5-HTergic neural circuit is implicated in consolation-like behaviors and sociability.</p></abstract><kwd-group kwd-group-type="author-keywords"><kwd>consolation</kwd><kwd>empathy</kwd><kwd>anterior cingulate cortex</kwd><kwd>serotonin</kwd><kwd>mandarin voles</kwd><kwd>dorsal raphe nucleus</kwd></kwd-group><kwd-group kwd-group-type="research-organism"><title>Research organism</title><kwd>Other</kwd></kwd-group><funding-group><award-group id="fund1"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100001809</institution-id><institution>National Natural Science Foundation of China</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>31970424</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Tai</surname><given-names>Fa-Dao</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund2"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100007128</institution-id><institution>Natural Science Foundation of Shaanxi Province</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>2018JM3032</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Tai</surname><given-names>Fa-Dao</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund3"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100012226</institution-id><institution>Fundamental Research Funds for the Central Universities</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>GK201903059</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Tai</surname><given-names>Fa-Dao</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund4"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100001809</institution-id><institution>National Natural Science Foundation of China</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>31670421</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Tai</surname><given-names>Fa-Dao</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund5"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100001809</institution-id><institution>National Natural Science Foundation of China</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>31372213</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Tai</surname><given-names>Fa-Dao</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund6"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100001809</institution-id><institution>National Natural Science Foundation of China</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>31772473</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Tai</surname><given-names>Fa-Dao</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><funding-statement>The funders had no role in study design, data collection and interpretation, or the decision to submit the work for publication.</funding-statement></funding-group><custom-meta-group><custom-meta specific-use="meta-only"><meta-name>Author impact statement</meta-name><meta-value>Inhibition of 5-HT neurons in the dorsal raphe nuclei or 5-HT terminals in the anterior cingulate cortex decreased consolation-like behaviors and reduced sociability.</meta-value></custom-meta></custom-meta-group></article-meta></front><body><sec id="s1" sec-type="intro"><title>Introduction</title><p>Consolation behavior, which is referred to as an increase in affiliative contact toward a distressed individual by an uninvolved bystander, is an important component of the social capabilities of humans (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">de Waal and Preston, 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Field et al., 2009</xref>). Impaired consolation has been frequently observed in many psychiatric diseases, such as depression, autism, and schizophrenia (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib56">Young et al., 2015</xref>). According to de Waal’s multilevel conceptualization of empathy (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">de Waal, 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">de Waal and Preston, 2017</xref>), consolation represents an intermediate level of empathy (the primary level of ‘emotional contagion’, the more complex level of ‘consolation’, and the most elaborate level of ‘perspective taking and targeted helping’), which has long been assumed to exist in species possessing complex cognitive functions, such as humans, apes, dolphins, and elephants (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib41">Pérez-Manrique and Gomila, 2018</xref>); however, recent studies have indicated that it also exists in some socially lived rodents, such as prairie voles (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Burkett et al., 2016</xref>), mandarin voles (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Li et al., 2019</xref>), and rats (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">Knapska et al., 2010</xref>).</p><p>Currently, studies of the neural mechanisms underlying consolation and other forms of empathy have primarily focused on the oxytocin systems (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Burkett et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Li et al., 2019</xref>). However, as a complex social behavior, consolation may require the coordinated actions of numerous neuromodulators and neurotransmitters. Serotonin (5-HT) is an evolutionarily ancient neurotransmitter that has long been implicated in a variety of emotional disorders (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Faye et al., 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Garcia-Garcia et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">Meneses and Liy-Salmeron, 2012</xref>). According to recent studies, 5-HT transmission is also involved in a series of social behaviors such as social interaction (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib50">Walsh et al., 2018</xref>), social reward, and aggression (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Dölen et al., 2013</xref>). Regarding empathy, a recent study revealed an association between salivary 5-HT levels and the empathic abilities of people (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">Matsunaga et al., 2017</xref>); a polymorphism in the promoter region of the 5-HT transporter gene has been linked to individual differences in empathy (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Gyurak et al., 2013</xref>); and MDMA (±3,4 methylenedioxymethamphetamine, better known as the recreational drug ‘ecstasy’), which is well known to stimulate a feeling of closeness and empathy in its users (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Carlyle et al., 2019</xref>), has been confirmed to robustly increase the release of 5-HT in an activity-independent manner (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Heifets and Malenka, 2016</xref>). In animal studies, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Kim et al., 2014</xref> found that microinjection of 5-HT into the anterior cingulate cortex (ACC) impairs vicarious fear and alters the regularity of neural oscillations in mice. Our recent study has indicated that 5-HT1A receptors within the ACC are involved in consolation deficits induced by chronic social defeat stress in mandarin voles (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">Li et al., 2020</xref>). However, to our knowledge, direct evidence for an association between 5-HT and consolation has yet to be obtained.</p><p>Dorsal raphe nucleus (DR) is a main source of 5-HT neurons and provides 70% of 5-HTergic projections in the forebrain (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Fu et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">Luo et al., 2015</xref>). DR 5-HTergic neurons form dense, broad, and bidirectional neural connections with a broad range of forebrain and limbic structures, including the ACC (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Celada et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Charnay and Léger, 2010</xref>), which is a central hub for various types of empathy. Therefore, direct modulation of the DR→ACC 5-HTergic circuit to investigate its functional role in consolation-like behaviors is interesting and meaningful.</p><p>The released 5-HT binds to pre- and postsynaptic receptors. To date, at least 14 different 5-HT receptor subtypes have been identified in the brain (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Artigas, 2013</xref>). Among them, 5HT1AR and 5HT2AR are the two main subtypes that are expressed at high levels in the prefrontal cortex (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Carhart-Harris and Nutt, 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib46">Santana and Artigas, 2017</xref>). The distribution, signaling pathways, and functions of these two receptors are substantially different, and both receptors play critical roles in modulating cortical activity and neural oscillations (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Celada et al., 2013</xref>). Previous studies have indicated that 5HT2AR gene single nucleotide polymorphisms are associated with empathy-related social communication abilities (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Gong et al., 2015</xref>), and a 5HT2AR agonist increases emotional empathic ability (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Dolder et al., 2017</xref>). However, in animal studies by <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Kim et al., 2014</xref>, blockade of 5-HT receptors in the ACC did not affect observational fear responses in mice. Clearly, the specific functions of 5HT1AR and 5HT2AR in empathy-like behaviors still require further examination.</p><p>The mandarin vole (<italic>Microtus mandarinus</italic>) is a socially monogamous rodent that is widely distributed across China (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">He et al., 2019</xref>). As shown in our previous studies, this species is capable of displaying consolation-like behaviors upon exposure to a distressed partner (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">Li et al., 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Li et al., 2019</xref>). In the present study, we first investigated the function of DR→ACC 5-HTergic circuits in consolation-like behaviors using optogenetic and chemogenetic approaches. To provide more direct evidence, we then monitored ACC 5-HT release and DR neuron activities during this behavior by using in vivo fiber photometry. Finally, we used chemogenetics plus pharmacological approaches to investigate which types of 5-HT receptors in the ACC are involved in consolation-like behaviors in mandarin voles. In order to investigate any potential sex differences during these processes, both male and female subjects were included in our study. As consolation is, in general, a pro-social behavior, some social behaviors were investigated during the tests.</p></sec><sec id="s2" sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><sec id="s2-1"><title>Optogenetic inhibition of DR 5-HT neurons in the DR→ACC neural circuit impaired consolation and reduced sociability</title><p>We first determined the 5-HTergic projection relationship between the DR and ACC in mandarin voles. For this experiment, the retrograde tracer cholera toxin subunit B (CTB) was injected into the ACC, followed by immunofluorescence staining of the DR sections with tryptophan hydroxylase 2 (TPH2), a marker of 5-HTergic neurons. A substantial number of TPH2+ neurons colocalized with CTB, indicating the presence of DR-ACC 5-HTergic projections (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1</xref>). We then used a novel dual-virus optogenetics approach to explore the function of the DR-ACC 5-HTergic circuit in consolation-like behaviors and sociability, where double-floxed AAV-DIO-ChR2-mCherry (DIO-ChR2) or AAV-DIO-eNpHR3.0-mCherry (DIO-eNpHR3.0) was injected into the DR and retro-AAVs containing the TPH2 promoter and Cre element (rAAV(Retro)-TPH2-Cre) were injected into the ACC (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1A</xref>). This virus strategy ensures that opsins (excitatory CHR2 or inhibitory eNpHR3.0) are mainly expressed within the DR-ACC 5-HTergic circuit. Immunohistochemical staining showed that more than 75% of mCherry-labeled neurons expressed TPH2 in both male and female voles, and more than 80% of TPH2+ cells coexpressed mCherry (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s2">Figure 1—figure supplement 2</xref>). In the electrophysiological study, we found that the DR neurons reliably responded to pulses of 473 (activation)/593 (inhibition) nm light stimuli (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1D–E</xref>). These results indicate the viability of this virus strategy.</p><fig-group><fig id="fig1" position="float"><label>Figure 1.</label><caption><title>Optogenetic bidirectional modulation of 5-HT neuron in the DR in the DR-ACC neural circuit.</title><p>(<bold>A</bold>) Schematic of optogenetic manipulation.

Similarly, the release of 5-HT significantly dropped before the end of allogrooming, approaching, and sniffing (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5s1">Figure 5—figure supplement 1</xref>).

In the same vein, we used this drug to investigate whether it could relieve the impaired consolation and sociability induced by the inhibition of DR-ACC 5-HTergic circuit, which aimed to clarify the involvement of 5-HT1AR during this process.

Our major findings are listed below. First, inhibition of DR 5-HT neurons or their terminals in the ACC decreased allogrooming behavior and reduced sociability. Second, DR 5-HT neuron activity and ACC 5-HT release increased during allogrooming, social approaching, and sniffing. Third, direct activation of ACC 5-HT1A receptors was sufficient to ameliorate deficits in consolation and sociability induced by chemogenetic inhibition of DR 5-HT neurons.</p><p>We found that optogenetic inhibition of DR 5-HT neurons (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1</xref>) or ACC 5-HT terminals (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2</xref>) significantly decreased intimate behaviors (allogrooming and chasing) toward their distressed partners and reduced sociability. Chemogenetic inhibition of DR 5-HT neurons produced similar results (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3</xref>). Consistent with our results, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib50">Walsh et al., 2018</xref> found that optogenetic inhibition of DR 5-HT neurons reduced social interactions in the three-chamber test. As consolation is in general a pro-social behavior, the reduced allogrooming may be largely due to an overall decrease in sociability. Further experiments are needed to address this interesting question.</p><p>Another open question is how this process occurs, namely, what the neural mechanisms underlying this process are. The neocortical excitatory/inhibitory (E/I) balance hypothesis may help address this question. The hypothesis indicates that an increase in the cortical cellular E/I balance, for example, through increased activity in excitatory neurons or a reduction in inhibitory neuron function, is the common etiology and final pathway for some psychiatric diseases, such as autism and schizophrenia (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Bozzi et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib49">Vattikuti and Chow, 2010</xref>). This hypothesis has recently been verified in mice, as optogenetic excitation of glutamatergic neurons in the mPFC elicits a profound impairment in sociability, while compensatory excitation of inhibitory neurons in this region partially rescues the social deficits caused by an increase in the E/I balance (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib55">Yizhar et al., 2011</xref>). 5-HT tends to inhibit prefrontal pyramidal activity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib44">Puig and Gulledge, 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib48">Tian et al., 2017</xref>). For example, according to <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib43">Puig et al., 2005</xref>, electrical stimulation of the DR inhibits approximately two-thirds of pyramidal neurons in the mPFC. Therefore, a reasonable hypothesis is that inhibition of the DR-ACC 5-HTergic neural circuit may increase the E/I balance, which ultimately leads to abnormal social behaviors in mandarin voles. Clearly, this hypothesis should be verified in electrophysiological studies in the future.</p><p>In contrast to inhibition manipulations, we found that activation of the DR-ACC 5-HTergic neural circuit did not elicit corresponding increases in allogrooming and sociability (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figures 1</xref>–<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">3</xref>). One possible explanation is that there are various 5-HT receptors expressed in the ACC and some have opposite functional effects (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib44">Puig and Gulledge, 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib48">Tian et al., 2017</xref>). For example, 5-HT1AR coupled to the Gi family of G proteins induces hyperpolarization of pyramidal neurons, whereas 5-HT2AR coupled to Gq proteins induces depolarization in the same neurons (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Carhart-Harris and Nutt, 2017</xref>). In addition, these two types of receptors are expressed in both pyramidal and GABAergic neurons of the mPFC (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib45">Santana et al., 2004</xref>). Therefore, the net behavioral effects of 5-HT release must result from the combined effects of all these receptors. The other possible explanation is a ceiling effect, which means that the enhancement of consolation and sociability is difficult to accomplish in these normal animals. This may occur in situations where levels of consolation and sociability are low, such as in the stressed subjects in our previous study (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">Li et al., 2020</xref>) or in the genetically less-sociable subjects as in the study by <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib50">Walsh et al., 2018</xref>. However, in a previous study by <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Kim et al., 2014</xref>, the direct administration of 5-HT into the ACC impaired observational fear learning, which is an indicator of emotional contagion. Species differences (mice vs voles), methodological differences (pharmacology vs optogenetics and chemogenetics) or different behavioral indicators (consolation vs emotional contagion) may account for the discrepancies. Furthermore, optogenetic or chemogenetic activation of DR 5-HT neurons is also distinct from pharmacological intervention with MDMA, which robustly induces 5-HT releases in the whole brain and enhances closeness and empathy in its users in human studies (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Carlyle et al., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Heifets and Malenka, 2016</xref>). Nevertheless, at least some effects of activation were visible. For example, optogenetic activation of ACC 5-HT terminals increased sociability in CHR2-expressing females (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2E</xref>). Clearly, the effects of activation of the DR-ACC 5-HTergic neural circuit on sociability and empathy still require further in-depth study.</p><p>Our results show that neither activation nor inhibition of the DR-ACC 5-HTergic neural circuit exerts any significant effect on some control behaviors (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s4">Figure 1—figure supplement 4</xref>; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s1">Figure 2—figure supplement 1</xref>; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s2">Figure 3—figure supplement 2</xref>), that is, selfgrooming in the consolation test or behavioral performance in the open-field test, which is consistent with previous results (for selfgrooming, please refer to <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Correia et al., 2017</xref>; for the open-field test, please refer to <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib50">Walsh et al., 2018</xref>). However, inconsistent results have also been reported. For example, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">Ohmura et al., 2014</xref> found that optogenetic activation of 5-HT neurons in the median raphe nucleus enhanced anxiety-like behaviors in mice. In the study by <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Correia et al., 2017</xref>, activation of 5-HTergic neurons in the DR affected behavior in the open-field test, but not anxiety. Different stimulation protocols or manipulations of different groups of 5-HT neurons may account for these discrepancies.</p><p>Our results obtained using in vivo fiber photometry indicated an increase in DR 5-HT neuron activity during allogrooming, sniffing, and social approaching (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4</xref>). This result is consistent with previous studies showing increases in the activity of 5-HTergic neurons in the DR during nonaggressive social interactions (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">Li et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib50">Walsh et al., 2018</xref>). Furthermore, using the highly sensitive 5-HT fluorescent sensors developed by <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib51">Wan et al., 2021</xref>, we provided the first evidence that allogrooming, sniffing, and social approaching elicit robust 5-HT release in the ACC (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5</xref>). Selfgrooming and running did not induce robust 5-HT release within the ACC, which may indicate the behavioral relevance of the 5-HT sensors. We also found that the fluorescence changes in GCamP6 and 5-HT sensors usually dropped before the end of these social behaviors (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s2">Figure 4—figure supplement 2</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5s1">Figure 5—figure supplement 1</xref>). These results indicate that 5-HT may be involved in some motivational aspects of these social behaviors, which is consistent with previous findings (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Arakawa, 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib54">Yagishita, 2020</xref>).</p><p>Although both 5-HT1AR and 5-HT2AR are expressed at high levels in the mPFC and work together to modulate cortical network activity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Celada et al., 2013</xref>), we found only the 5-HT1AR receptor agonist significantly reduced the consolation and sociability deficits induced by chemogenetic inhibition of 5-HTergic neurons in the DR (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6</xref>). This result is consistent with our previous finding that the administration of WAY-100635 (a 5-HT1AR antagonist) into the ACC attenuates consolation and sociability in mandarin voles (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">Li et al., 2020</xref>). 5-HT1AR within the mPFC has frequently been reported to exert antidepressant and anxiolytic effects (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Artigas, 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Fukumoto et al., 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Fukumoto et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib52">Wang et al., 2019</xref>), but our findings clearly indicate that this type of 5-HT receptor within the ACC is also involved in regulating some social behaviors. Clearly, this effect should be verified in many other species in future studies. Administration of the 5-HT2AR antagonist into the ACC did not exert an obvious effect on the social deficits induced by the chemogenetic inhibition of DR 5-HT neurons (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5F–H</xref>). Thus, 5-HT2AR within the ACC may not play a major role in consolation and sociability. However, this conclusion should be interpreted very cautiously because 5-HT2AR expression within the mPFC shows clear rostral-to-caudal gradients in mice (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib53">Weber and Andrade, 2010</xref>) and we were unable to determine its functional role in this dimension in the present study. Furthermore, the effects of 5-HT in the ACC on consolation and sociability probably involve other subtypes of 5-HT receptors, such as 5-HT1BR and 5-HT3R, which requires further examination.</p><p>In conclusion, our findings establish the importance of the DR-ACC 5-HTergic neural circuit in consolation-like behaviors and sociability in mandarin voles. One major limitation of our study is that although our virus strategies were generally successful, a few of the infected neurons were indeed TPH2-negative, which may challenge the specificity of our manipulations and confound our results. However, the fiber photometry and pharmacological studies mitigate these concerns. Considering the widespread innervation of 5-HT terminals and abundant distribution of 5-HT receptors in the whole brain, detailed knowledge of cellular and circuit mechanisms of the 5-HTergic system will not only improve our understanding of its complicated features and functions but also have implications for the development of novel therapies for the treatment of prevalent neuropsychiatric disorders, such as depression, autism, and schizophrenia. Additionally, although both male and female subjects were included in this study, sexually dimorphic effects were rarely observed. This finding may provide additional evidence of cooperative evolution to adapt to environmental challenges, particularly in species that adapt to monogamous relationships and require cooperative breeding.</p></sec><sec id="s4" sec-type="materials|methods"><title>Materials and methods</title><table-wrap id="keyresource" position="anchor"><label>Key resources table</label><table frame="hsides" rules="groups"><thead><tr><th valign="top">Reagent type <break/>(species) or <break/>resource</th><th valign="top">Designation</th><th valign="top">Source or <break/>reference</th><th valign="top">Identifiers</th><th valign="top">Additional information</th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td valign="top">Antibody</td><td valign="top">Anti-TPH2 (goat polyclonal antibody)</td><td valign="top">Abcam</td><td valign="top">ab121013;

Briefly, 5 days before the experiment, age-matched adult male and female voles were cohoused together to promote the formation of a pair bond (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib57">Yu et al., 2012</xref>). On the testing day, the subjects’ partners were gently transferred in a cup to a sound-proof electric shock chamber and then subjected to 10 rounds of moderately strong foot shocks (3 s, 0.8 mA, 2-min intertrial intervals). At the same time, the test voles were left undisturbed in their home cages. After the separation, the pairs were reunited, and the behavior of the subjects was recorded using a video camera for 10 min in the test room.

The apparatus consisted of a rectangular box with three separate chambers (20 × 40 × 20 cm each). One side of each chamber contained a circular metal wire cage (stimulus animal cage, 11 cm high and 9 cm in diameter). 1 day before the test, all subjects were habituated to the arena for 5 min and age- and sex-matched unfamiliar stimulus voles were also habituated to the wire cages for 5 min. On the testing day, the test vole was placed in the center chamber and a ‘stimulus’ vole (housed in the same room with the test voles) was randomly placed into one of the wire cages. After 2 min, the partitioning walls between the chambers were removed and the test voles were allowed to explore freely for a 10 min session. The time spent exploring each chamber was automatically recorded using a video tracking system (Shanghai Xinruan, China). Sociability was calculated as follows: (time spent in the stimulus vole side − time spent in the empty side)/(time spent in the stimulus vole side + time spent in the empty side).</p><p>For optogenetic tests, voles received four epochs of light beginning with a light OFF baseline epoch (OFF-ON-OFF-ON).

behaviors, this study breaks ground in implicating 5ht dorsal raphe neurons in the same. Given the rich pharmacopeia of drugs acting on 5ht transmission, the findings hold translational promise.</p><p><bold>Decision letter after peer review:</bold></p><p>[Editors’ note: the authors submitted for reconsideration following the decision after peer review. What follows is the decision letter after the first round of review.]</p><p>Thank you for submitting your work entitled &quot;Dorsal raphe nuclei to anterior cingulate cortex 5-HTergic neural circuit modulate consolation and sociability&quot; for consideration by <italic>eLife</italic>. Your article has been reviewed by 4 peer reviewers, , including Peggy Mason as the Reviewing Editor and Reviewer #1, and the evaluation has been overseen a Senior Editor. The following individuals involved in review of your submission have agreed to reveal their identity: Christian Keysers (Reviewer #2); JP Burkett (Reviewer #3).</p><p>This is a multi-pronged study of the contribution of 5ht projections from DR to ACC in consolation behavior in mandarin voles. There was much that the reviewers liked about this study and the manuscript. However, concerns about the photometry data lead us to reject the manuscript, in its present form. There are concerns about the specificity of the method for detecting 5ht. These concerns, well articulated by Reviewer 4 and described below, require new experiments. Should you be able to gather data that assuage these concerns, we would be willing to consider this manuscript as a new submission. While specific reviews are included below, I also highlight here several other concerns that will be critical to address for a successful revision.</p><p>– Photometry data: We noted that recordings of the 5HT sensor are confounded by the potential presence of GCAMP in ACC terminals. This could be resolved in several ways for example conducting the 5HT and GCAMP recordings in separate subjects. Validation for the selectivity of the 5HT sensor is needed. A control for motion artifact is also needed.</p><p>– Is the observed effect attributable specifically to consolation or could it be a more general effect on sociability? The latter possibility should be considered and discussed.</p><p>– The exclusion of data from animals that froze is highly problematic. Please expand on how often this exclusionary criterion was invoked and provide justification for the exclusion.</p><p>– The statistical tests used were not compelling to the reviewers. Reviewer #2 outlines many ways to improve this aspect of the presentation. In addition, the authors should consider straightforward equivalence testing, such as equivalence tests (eg TOST) as well as ANOVAs (and MANOVAs) to address correcting for multiple comparisons (see Reviewer 3).</p><p>– The change in fluorescence follows the behavior of interest. This is not compatible with the causality implied by the authors' interpretation. This needs to be discussed and possibly aspects of the timing re-analyzed along the lines suggested by Reviewer #2.</p><p>– Is consolation behavior at a maximum such that a further enhancement could not be observed with 5ht? The possibility of a ceiling effect as outlined by Reviewer #2 should be considered.</p><p>– A schematic showing histological verification of all fiber placements for each experiment is needed. In addition to showing microscopy images showing a larger region of the brain to confirm the image location, it would also help to show a schematic representation of the viral expression spread for each subject (e.g., overlaid on brain slice schematics) for each experiment.</p><p><italic>Reviewer #1:</italic></p><p>This is a multi-pronged study of the contribution of 5ht projections from DR to ACC in consolation behavior in mandarin voles.</p><p>There are writing issues that make less than facile to read. However, these issues can be overcome, and the data are extensive and worthy of consideration despite the challenges to the reader.</p><p>The one critical concern that I have is that the authors have not demonstrated that this is consolation behavior as opposed to reunification behavior. In the Burkett et al. study, a very important control of separation without shock was performed. Here that control was not performed. Thus fundamentally the argument that what is being represented here is reunion behavior rather than consolation cannot be refuted by the available evidence.</p><p>The behavior should be described in the Results as well as in the methods. <italic>eLife</italic> is a journal for the general reader who is unlikely to be familiar with the empathy literature.</p><p>Are there 5ht terminals in the ACC from median raphe?</p><p>Make the scales in Figure 4 constant.</p><p>293 Why put a 5ht2ar antagonist while inhibiting DR 5ht neurons? Why not put in an agonist as was done with the 5ht1ar?</p><p><italic>Reviewer #2:</italic></p><p>In their paper, Li et al., examine the contribution of serotonin in the ACC to consolation behavior in voles. They show that consolation (as measured as an increase of allogroming towards a mate that has been exposed to shocks), as well as social preference (as measured as more time spent close to a conspecific in a 3 compartment test), are reduced when inhibiting the dorsal raphe-&gt;anterior cingulate 5HT pathway, and that this can be rescued using a 5HT1A receptor agonist. In addition, they measure transient increases of 5HT in the ACC following the onset of allogrooming and social approach.</p><p>In general, this is an interesting and well-conducted study, that combines techniques to interfere with the DR-&gt;ACC pathway (including chemo and optogenetic approaches) with some physiology (calcium imaging in DR and 5HT sensors in ACC), to create a series of studies that compel the reader to accept the importance of 5HT on allogroming and social approach.</p><p>a) Statistic reporting. The paper contains a large number of data, which is great. However, the presentation of the statistical tests and results is often difficult to understand in detail. I applaud the presence of the data-tables for download, and the rigorous illustration of single subject data in most figures. However, results in the text seldom allow to fully understand what statistical test was used. For instance, in the 3 chamber test in Figure 1, the appropriate test would appear to be a group (mcherry vs Chr2) x condition (laser on vs off) interaction in an ANOVA, which is equivalent to a two-sample t-test of the difference On – Off. Please specify in the text and the figures whether an ANOVA looked at this interaction specifically, and always report exact p-values. Also in the figures, when specific t-test were performed, please indicate the test statistic in the figure (e.g. t(n)=x, p=0.0x), whether significant or not, given there is enough space in the figures. In the current version it is often difficult to assess whether statements of effect or no effect are based on ANOVAs (and if so on what interaction or main effect in that ANOVA) or on posthoc t-tests. I know this makes figures a bit more cluttered, but it provides the reader with a richer understanding of the data.</p><p>b) Bayesian statistics. The manuscript contains many highly relevant statements that hinge on the fact that a particular condition had no effect on a particular outcome measure, or that a condition brings contagion levels back to normal. These are statements that frequentist statistics (t-test or ANOVA) cannot support, but that are important in the paper. This is because p&gt;0.05 does not provide evidence for H0 (the absence of an effect). Bayes Factor analyses, in contrast, can easily test (see Keysers, Gazzola and Wagenmakers, Nature Neuroscience, 2020 for details of why and how to do that) and quantify evidence for H0. Therefore please always also provide the Bayes factor for the t-tests, and the Bayesfactor for the inclusion of a factor/interaction in an ANOVA. Given that most of your hypotheses are directional, e.g. inhibition of DR-&gt;ACC should reduce allogrooming and social preference, I would recommend using directed hypotheses for the Bayesian test to provide more power in favour of H0. This will indicate whether you have evidence that a manipulation had no effect (BF-0&lt;1/3 or BFincl&lt;1/3) or whether you simply have too much variance or two small a group size to establish that a condition had no effect (1/3&lt;BF&lt;3). These analyses can be easily done using JASP on the tables that you provide, and please indicate the BF-0 values together with the t-values in your figures, and adjust your result description according to whether you have evidence of absence or absence of evidence. I know this is some additional work, and people are only starting to adopt BF testing, but this would really help the reader understand when you really have evidence that a manipulation had no effect (BF&lt;1/3) vs. cases in which your group size is simply too small to exclude an effect (see power considerations in point c).</p><p>c) t-test vs ANOVA: in some cases, your statements call for ANOVA's or Bayesian statistics not t-tests. For instance you write: &quot;Pretreatment with 8-OH-DPAT reversed the dysfunctions to the normal level (all P &gt; 0.05 for '8-OH-DPAT+CNO' vs. 'vehicle+saline' pos-hoc comparisons; Figure 5C-D)&quot;. Now, to state that it fully reversed to normal level, you need to show that BF-0 for '8-OH-DPAT+CNO' vs. 'vehicle+saline' is &lt;1/3. If you lack power to establish that, you could use an ANOVA to show that 'Vehicle+Saline – Vehicle+CNO &gt; 8-OH-DPAT+Saline – 8-OH-DPAT+CNO', and say that 8-OH-DPAT+CNO significantly reduces the impact of CNO. Both of these would be evidence for something. Currently, simply showing the lack of a significant effect (p&gt;0.05) is simply not evidence for anything, and should be replaced. See Nieuwenhuis, Forstmann and Wagenmakers, (2011) Erroneous Analyses of Interactions in Neuroscience: A Problem of Significance. Nat. Neurosci. 14, 1105-1107, for a more principled discussion of why a lack of significant difference is not the same as a significant interaction. This issue is particularly relevant in this study, that uses small sample sizes as far as statistical power goes, even though I am of course fully aware that larger sample sizes would in so many conditions would not be ethically desirable, but one must be aware that in groups of 8 individuals, and a between group comparison, even large effects (cohen d=0.8) will only be detected in 32% of cases, so even if there is a large effect, you would be more likely not to find it, than to find it, and not finding p&lt;0.05 is thus not evidence for absence even of large effects. After boneferoni correction, things become even worse… This should be carefully addressed throughout the paper, based on ANOVA's or Bayesfactor analyses to qualify statements.</p><p>d) Timing of 5HT signals: Line 258+ and Figure 4: it is intriguing that the DeltaF/F seems to increase after onset of the behavior, not prior to onset, if I fully understand the meaning of the '0' point in the Figure 4. The 5HT modulation experiments that you present before seem to suggest causality in the sense of 5HT-&gt;social interest and 5HT-&gt;allogrooming. For 5HT to trigger those behaviors, one would however expect the fluorescence to precede the behavior, not to follow it. If I understand correctly that the fluorescence follows the behavior rather than preceding them, it would be incompatible with the notion that 5HT triggers the behavior. However 5HT may then maintain the behavior rather than triggering it. Could that be the case? I would suggest providing the following additional data to test this notion: (a) align the fluorescence to the end of the behavior (i.e. moving away from animal in social preference test and stop of grooming or departure from animal in consolation). Would a drop of fluorescence precede the end of the behavior? Second, rather than only plotting the total time in allogrooming or spent with the conspecific, please also present metrics of the duration of the bouts and the number of bouts. If 5HT were to act by prolonging rather than triggering consolation and approach, the bout duration may be a better indicator than the total duration. Please provide this data, and discuss the timing of the fluorescence response and its implications for the role of 5HT in triggering vs. maintaining consolation and approach in the Discussion section.</p><p>e) Freezing: Line 482: &quot;if the subject showed evidently immobility, the data were excluded&quot;. This statement surprised me, and alerted me to the fact that freezing behavior is not explicitly discussed in the manuscript. Methodologically, I wasn't quite sure what this actually meant: were entire animals removed from the data? How was data-removal performed and how does it affect the presented durations. Does immobility refer to the stressed target of the consolation or the consolator (please specify this throughout the manuscript). Second, freezing has been a key indicator of emotional contagion, and hence of intersubject sensitivity, in the rodent literature. If a stressed demonstrator causes the observer to freeze, this is an important indicator of a reaction to the distress of others, that should really be reported throughout the manuscript. For instance, we know that oxytocin can switch animals between a more active way of coping and a more passive way of coping. If 5HT were to do something like that, it could increase allogrooming, and reduce vicarious freezing in reaction to a stressed demonstrator. Please quantify freezing and immobility, and report it throughout all manipulations, unless it is so rare, that this doesn't make sense. In that case, report briefly how often freezing occurs.</p><p>f) Grammar: there are a few grammatical errors in the manuscript. These errors do not compromise the meaning of the manuscript, and are not a big deal, but it may be more elegant to remove them.</p><p><italic>Reviewer #3:</italic></p><p>This manuscript represents a deep-dive into the role of the raphe-to-cingulate serotonergic circuit in empathy-based consoling behavior in the vole. This is a new and underdeveloped literature, and while this is not the first paper to implicate serotonin in empathy-related behavior in rodents, it is certainly the most methodologically thorough. In addition, the use of vole species allows the authors to measure pro-social behavior in a way not possible in other models.</p><p>This research is well designed, well executed, well written, and comprehensively answers the question posed. At every stage, the manuscript anticipated my questions and answered them. It will be well-cited in the field. I strongly recommend it for publication.</p><p>1. The authors report several behavioral outcome measures in each behavior test. It would be helpful if the authors listed all of the behavioral outcomes measured in the Methods section for each test. Additionally, they should make clear how statistical corrections for multiple comparisons were conducted, if at all. If no corrections were performed, the authors can simply identify in the Methods which behavior was considered the primary outcome measure and which were secondary/exploratory.</p><p><italic>Reviewer #4:</italic></p><p>Overall, this is a straightforward paper in which the authors use orthogonal molecular-genetic approaches to determine the necessity of the DRN→ACC pathway in consolation (e.g. allogrooming of a stressed partner) and social investigation. The paper is impressive given the challenges and limitations of implementing many of these techniques in a non-standard model species, such as the mandarin vole. The paper would be strengthened by applying more rigor with respect to interpretation of results and validation of technical approaches.</p><p>1) Throughout the paper the authors refer to empathy-like behaviors, as demonstrated by allogrooming in the consolation test. However, there are marked deficits in general sociability from all their manipulations and no other measures of consolation-specific behaviors, making it likely that effects from inhibition of the DRN→ACC on consolation behaviors are not consolation/empathy-specific, but rather a side effect of disruption of sociability or pro-social behaviors in general. Though this issue is addressed briefly in the discussion, it warrants a more consistent acknowledgment and perhaps a reframing of the paper and the overall interpretation of the results. This does not diminish the importance of the author's findings.</p><p>2) The application of the dual-site fiber photometry recording, using a novel 5-HT sensor and GCaMP in a non-standard species is impressive. However, there are a number of concerns regarding the implementation of the approach and the specificity of the 5-HT signal. a) There is no demonstration that the 5-HT sensor is specifically providing a readout for extracellular 5-HT. Given that this sensor has not been extensively used/published in vivo (and never in voles), it is important to show that an antagonist blocks the behavior-associated changes in fluorescence (or another relevant validation approach). b) It is possible that the correlation in dF/F observed in the PFC and in the raphe is not due to 5-HT in the PFC but instead due to GCaMP expressed in DRN terminals in the PFC. This would be ideally addressed by imaging in DRN and PFC of GCaMP-only animals. However, it is worth noting that these concerns are mitigated by the pharmacological results in Figure 5. c) There is no explanation for how the authors controlled for motion artifacts, which are concerning given that their analysis focuses on active behaviors. Despite referring to &quot;multi-channel fibre [sic] photometry&quot; in the methods, they describe recording using only a 480 nm LED, so cannot take advantage of an isosbestic signal. Showing that GFP-expressing animals do not show reliable changes in dF/F during these behaviors would ameliorate these concerns.</p><p>[Editors’ note: further revisions were suggested prior to acceptance, as described below.]</p><p>Thank you for resubmitting your work entitled &quot;Dorsal raphe nucleus to anterior cingulate cortex 5-HTergic neural circuit modulates consolation and sociability&quot; for further consideration by <italic>eLife</italic>.

The timing of which you write: &quot;Interestingly, we found that the fluorescence changes in GCamP6 and 5-HT sensors usually precede allogrooming and social approaching&quot; is not supported by the analysis. See reviewer #3's comments for more detail on this concern.</p><p>3) While the title and much of the text along with the results do not distinguish between sociability and consolation, the paragraph on lines 379-388 attempts to make just such a distinction. This should be either changed to bring it in line with the results and remaining text or it should be omitted.</p><p>4) Please explain why you would use 8OH-DPAT, an agonist, in the same vein as you used a true 5ht2a antagonist. In the literature, DPAT is often used to reduce 5ht release presumably through effects on presynaptic receptors. But why combine this with the inhibition of 5ht release? Please explain this logic fully. The lines on 339-40 do not explain this sufficiently.</p><p>5) In figure 5 E-I it is not clear how the SEM was calculated and it looks as though it is parallel to the average which it would not be if SEM was calculated at each individual time point which is the more appropriate way to convey this information.</p><p>6) In the plots to the right of the traces there are only 6 events. It is not clear how many animals were used and which events were used.

Major strengths include the plethora of techniques brought to bear on a focused question. The only substantial quibble I would have with the authors would be in their efforts to distinguish between consolation and sociability (as measured by approach in a 3-chamber test). They show no distinction and thus whether consolation is primary, secondary or parallel to sociability remains entirely unclear.</p><p>I still am unclear on how many animals were excluded for freezing. The authors need to articulate how many animals were tested in each group and the number excluded in each group.</p><p>I remain less than convinced that the behavior is consolation rather than sociablity. In their rebuttal, the authors compare allogrooming to self-grooming. This is orthogonal to the point. The key point here is that there are changes in the 3-chamber test that accompany each decrease in consolation behavior; the authors interpret these changes as a decrease in sociability. I do not quibble with the data. I do take exception to the efforts to distinguish between sociability and consolation such as the paragraph on lines 379-388. I do not see grounds for any distinction between sociability and consolation, as the title correctly albeit indirectly suggests.</p><p>Other concerns have been allayed.</p><p><italic>Reviewer #2:</italic></p><p>This is a re-submission of a manuscript I previously reviewed for this journal. The authors have generally answered all of the questions I posed and made all recommended edits. I have no further comments at this time, though I remain concerned about methodological issues previously raised by other reviewers and satisfactory response to these reviewers' concerns is a necessary precondition for publication.</p><p><italic>Reviewer #3:</italic></p><p>I thank the authors for the thoughtful revision of the paper, and the new data, that further strengthens what is a very strong paper. In particular, the addition of Bayesian statistics, and the careful rephrasing of conclusions in the light of the Bayesian statistics is very helpful. Intuitively, I would have welcomed the inclusion of the key statistics in the figures themselves, rather than in the supplementary 2, but this can be argued either way, and the important factor is that the appropriate statistic is now available and appropriately discussed.</p><p>My only remaining comment, which is a nuance rather than a limitation of the paper, regards the photometry signal. In the initial submission, I was surprised that the signal increase followed rather than preceded the consolation behavior. There is now new data, which provides additional evidence that the signal is robustly increased during the social behavior, and together with all the other causal data, this makes a strong case for a relationship between 5HT and these behaviors. The only nuance that I'm still finding difficult to grasp, is the timing relative to onset of the behavior. In the new version you still write: &quot;Interestingly, we found that the fluorescence changes in GCamP6 and 5-HT sensors usually precede allogrooming and social approaching&quot;. This is what one would hope for. Unfortunately, I cannot quite see the analysis on which this statement is based. A statistical quantification of the signal in the 100ms before the behavior compared to a further distant baseline might do, or something similar, but currently I really do not see statistical data to support the claim. I would thus suggest either to add a statistical analysis for that, or to remove the statement about this precedence. This is true both in the results and the discussion, where you currently write &quot;Interesting, the increased Ca<sup>2+</sup> in DR 5-HT neurons often preceded these behaviors which may indicate the motivational function of 5HT (Arakawa, 2020; Yagishita, 2020)&quot;. On the other hand, you now provide nice evidence that it decreases before the end of the behavior, in line with the idea that it maintains and motivates the behavior somehow.</p><p><italic>Reviewer #4:</italic></p><p>This is a revised manuscript in which the authors address prior reviewer concerns. Specifically, the authors do a good job of addressing concerns regarding the origin of the fluorescent signal in their fiber photometry experiments, clarifying the logic of the paper, employing Bayesian-based statistical approaches, and other improvements. One remaining concern is regarding the logic underlying the pharmacology experiments. Specifically, figure 6 compares data side by side between 5HT1A agonist and 5HT2A antagonist. It is unclear why it was necessary to block the 5HT2A receptor DURING CNO-mediated inhibition of 5-HT release. If the 5HT2A receptor is important how does blocking it when 5-HT is inhibited by CNO test this?</p></body></sub-article><sub-article article-type="reply" id="sa2"><front-stub><article-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.67638.sa2</article-id><title-group><article-title>Author response</article-title></title-group></front-stub><body><p>[Editors’ note: the authors resubmitted a revised version of the paper for consideration. What follows is the authors’ response to the first round of review.]</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>This is a multi-pronged study of the contribution of 5ht projections from DR to ACC in consolation behavior in mandarin voles. There was much that the reviewers liked about this study and the manuscript. However, concerns about the photometry data lead us to reject the manuscript, in its present form. There are concerns about the specificity of the method for detecting 5ht. These concerns, well articulated by Reviewer 4 and described below, require new experiments. Should you be able to gather data that assuage these concerns, we would be willing to consider this manuscript as a new submission. While specific reviews are included below, I also highlight here several other concerns that will be critical to address for a successful revision.</p><p>– Photometry data: We noted that recordings of the 5HT sensor are confounded by the potential presence of GCAMP in ACC terminals. This could be resolved in several ways for example conducting the 5HT and GCAMP recordings in separate subjects. Validation for the selectivity of the 5HT sensor is needed. A control for motion artifact is also needed.</p></disp-quote><p>Thank you very much for your good suggestions. We conducted the 5HT sensor and GCAMP recordings in separate animals in the revised version (Figure 4, Figure 5). To validate the selectivity of the 5-HT sensor in mandarin voles, a 5-HT receptor antagonist metergoline (Met) was injected (i.p., 4 mg/kg) before conducting the fiber photometry experiments [1,2]. We found the injection of Met completely blocked the fluorescence change of the 5-HT sensor upon allogrooming (Figure 5—figure supplement 2). In control animals that expressed GFP, we observed little changes in fluorescence which excluded the artifacts of motion (Figure 4, Figure 5).</p><p>Citations</p><p>1.

As consolation is in general a pro-social behavior, the reduced allogrooming is therefore likely due to the overall decrease in sociability. However, we found both DR 5-HT neurons and ACC 5-HT release showed the highest response during allogrooming (Figure 4—figure supplement 2). Both Burkett’s and our previous study indicated that allogrooming toward a distressed partner is a typical feature of consolation [1,2]. Therefore, we think it is appropriate to say that “DRN→ACC 5-HTergic neural circuit play an important regulatory role in consolation and sociability in mandarin voles”. We discussed this point in the revised version (page 21 line 384-388).</p><p>“…As consolation is in general a pro-social behavior, it is difficult to determine whether the reduced allogrooming is due to an overall decrease in sociability.

It is well-known that 5HT1AR and 5HT2AR are the two main subtypes that expressed at high levels in the mPFC [1,2]. Both in vitro and in vivo evidences indicate that these two types of receptors exert opposite effects in the mPFC. For example, 5-HT1AR coupled to the Gi family of G proteins induces hyperpolarization of pyramidal neurons, whereas 5-HT2AR coupled to Gq proteins induces depolarization in the same neurons [3]. In our previous study, we had indicated that ACC administration of a 5HT1AR agonist (8-OH-DPAT) rescued the reduced consolation and sociability induced by social defeat [4]. We therefore used a 5-HT2AR antagonist here to investigate if this drug could similarly reverse the chemogenetic inhibition effect. We try to make this point more clearly and easier to understand in the revised version (page 18, Line 339-340).</p><p>Citations</p><p>1. Carhart-Harris, R. L., and Nutt, D. J. (2017).

The paper contains a large number of data, which is great. However, the presentation of the statistical tests and results is often difficult to understand in detail. I applaud the presence of the data-tables for download, and the rigorous illustration of single subject data in most figures. However, results in the text seldom allow to fully understand what statistical test was used. For instance, in the 3 chamber test in Figure 1, the appropriate test would appear to be a group (mcherry vs Chr2) x condition (laser on vs off) interaction in an ANOVA, which is equivalent to a two-sample t-test of the difference On – Off. Please specify in the text and the figures whether an ANOVA looked at this interaction specifically, and always report exact p-values. Also in the figures, when specific t-test were performed, please indicate the test statistic in the figure (e.g. t(n)=x, p=0.0x), whether significant or not, given there is enough space in the figures. In the current version it is often difficult to assess whether statements of effect or no effect are based on ANOVAs (and if so on what interaction or main effect in that ANOVA) or on posthoc t-tests. I know this makes figures a bit more cluttered, but it provides the reader with a richer understanding of the data.</p></disp-quote><p>We appreciate much for your good suggestions. In the revised version, all the analysis methods and statistical quantifications are presented in Supplementary 2.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>b) Bayesian statistics. The manuscript contains many highly relevant statements that hinge on the fact that a particular condition had no effect on a particular outcome measure, or that a condition brings contagion levels back to normal. These are statements that frequentist statistics (t-test or ANOVA) cannot support, but that are important in the paper. This is because p&gt;0.05 does not provide evidence for H0 (the absence of an effect). Bayes Factor analyses, in contrast, can easily test (see Keysers, Gazzola and Wagenmakers, Nature Neuroscience, 2020 for details of why and how to do that) and quantify evidence for H0. Therefore please always also provide the Bayes factor for the t-tests, and the Bayesfactor for the inclusion of a factor/interaction in an ANOVA. Given that most of your hypotheses are directional, e.g. inhibition of DR-&gt;ACC should reduce allogrooming and social preference, I would recommend using directed hypotheses for the Bayesian test to provide more power in favour of H0. This will indicate whether you have evidence that a manipulation had no effect (BF-0&lt;1/3 or BFincl&lt;1/3) or whether you simply have too much variance or two small a group size to establish that a condition had no effect (1/3&lt;BF&lt;3). These analyses can be easily done using JASP on the tables that you provide, and please indicate the BF-0 values together with the t-values in your figures, and adjust your result description according to whether you have evidence of absence or absence of evidence. I know this is some additional work, and people are only starting to adopt BF testing, but this would really help the reader understand when you really have evidence that a manipulation had no effect (BF&lt;1/3) vs. cases in which your group size is simply too small to exclude an effect (see power considerations in point c).</p></disp-quote><p>I must applaud these excellent comments and we learn much for that. It is an amazing experience to conduct Bayesian test with JASP. For clear and concise, all the analysis methods and qualifications are presented in Supplementary 2.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>c) t-test vs ANOVA: in some cases, your statements call for ANOVA's or Bayesian statistics not t-tests. For instance you write: &quot;Pretreatment with 8-OH-DPAT reversed the dysfunctions to the normal level (all P &gt; 0.05 for '8-OH-DPAT+CNO' vs. 'vehicle+saline' pos-hoc comparisons; Figure 5C-D)&quot;. Now, to state that it fully reversed to normal level, you need to show that BF-0 for '8-OH-DPAT+CNO' vs. 'vehicle+saline' is &lt;1/3. If you lack power to establish that, you could use an ANOVA to show that 'Vehicle+Saline – Vehicle+CNO &gt; 8-OH-DPAT+Saline – 8-OH-DPAT+CNO', and say that 8-OH-DPAT+CNO significantly reduces the impact of CNO. Both of these would be evidence for something. Currently, simply showing the lack of a significant effect (p&gt;0.05) is simply not evidence for anything, and should be replaced. See Nieuwenhuis, Forstmann and Wagenmakers, (2011) Erroneous Analyses of Interactions in Neuroscience: A Problem of Significance. Nat. Neurosci. 14, 1105-1107, for a more principled discussion of why a lack of significant difference is not the same as a significant interaction. This issue is particularly relevant in this study, that uses small sample sizes as far as statistical power goes, even though I am of course fully aware that larger sample sizes would in so many conditions would not be ethically desirable, but one must be aware that in groups of 8 individuals, and a between group comparison, even large effects (cohen d=0.8) will only be detected in 32% of cases, so even if there is a large effect, you would be more likely not to find it, than to find it, and not finding p&lt;0.05 is thus not evidence for absence even of large effects. After boneferoni correction, things become even worse… This should be carefully addressed throughout the paper, based on ANOVA's or Bayesfactor analyses to qualify statements.</p></disp-quote><p>According to your suggestions, we reanalyzed the data.</p><p>Although we can’t find the BF-0 value for '8-OH-DPAT+CNO' vs. 'vehicle+saline' less than 1/3, we did find 'Vehicle+Saline – Vehicle+CNO &gt; 8-OH-DPAT+Saline – 8-OH-DPAT+CNO' (Figure 6_Figure Supplementary 1A(allogrooming): Male: t<sub>(8)</sub> = 2.375, P = 0.045, BF+0 = 3.750 with median posterior δ = 0.999, 95%CI = [0.091 to 2.493]; Female: t<sub>(10)</sub> = 2.639, P = 0.025, BF+0 = 5.482 with median posterior δ = 1.075, 95%CI = [0.123 to 2.453].

The 5HT modulation experiments that you present before seem to suggest causality in the sense of 5HT-&gt;social interest and 5HT-&gt;allogrooming. For 5HT to trigger those behaviors, one would however expect the fluorescence to precede the behavior, not to follow it. If I understand correctly that the fluorescence follows the behavior rather than preceding them, it would be incompatible with the notion that 5HT triggers the behavior. However 5HT may then maintain the behavior rather than triggering it. Could that be the case? I would suggest providing the following additional data to test this notion: (a) align the fluorescence to the end of the behavior (i.e. moving away from animal in social preference test and stop of grooming or departure from animal in consolation). Would a drop of fluorescence precede the end of the behavior? Second, rather than only plotting the total time in allogrooming or spent with the conspecific, please also present metrics of the duration of the bouts and the number of bouts. If 5HT were to act by prolonging rather than triggering consolation and approach, the bout duration may be a better indicator than the total duration. Please provide this data, and discuss the timing of the fluorescence response and its implications for the role of 5HT in triggering vs. maintaining consolation and approach in the Discussion section.</p></disp-quote><p>As suggested, we replicated the GCamp6 and 5-HT fiber photometric experiments in separated animals and found that both the signals reliably increased before allogrooming, social approaching and sniffing (Figure 4 and 5). When aligning the fluorescence signals to the end of these behaviors, the DeltaF/F values invariably decreased before withdrawing from these behaviors (Figure 4—figure supplement 3A-3B; Figure 5—figure supplement 1). All the results indicate that 5HT may be involved in some motivational aspect of these behaviors. This point had been discussed in the revised version (page 14, line 258-259; page 24, line 451-452).</p><p>We reviewed our data and found the inhibition manipulations largely impact the number of bouts rather than the bout duration of allogrooming and chasing, etc. This is consistent with the motivational effect of 5-HT.

This statement surprised me, and alerted me to the fact that freezing behavior is not explicitly discussed in the manuscript. Methodologically, I wasn't quite sure what this actually meant: were entire animals removed from the data? How was data-removal performed and how does it affect the presented durations. Does immobility refer to the stressed target of the consolation or the consolator (please specify this throughout the manuscript). Second, freezing has been a key indicator of emotional contagion, and hence of intersubject sensitivity, in the rodent literature. If a stressed demonstrator causes the observer to freeze, this is an important indicator of a reaction to the distress of others, that should really be reported throughout the manuscript. For instance, we know that oxytocin can switch animals between a more active way of coping and a more passive way of coping. If 5HT were to do something like that, it could increase allogrooming, and reduce vicarious freezing in reaction to a stressed demonstrator. Please quantify freezing and immobility, and report it throughout all manipulations, unless it is so rare, that this doesn't make sense. In that case, report briefly how often freezing occurs.</p></disp-quote><p>We are very sorry for the confusion. Actually, on rare occasions in the behavioral test, some tested subjects (not the stimulus voles) show little or no movements, i.e., they just sited there during all the testing period. We then think it is not appropriate to include these statistics in the following analysis. The sample size is then ‘7’ in some cases (Source data file; Figure 1I: Male_ChR2 group, Female_ChR2 group; Figure 1L: Male_Dio group; Figure 2H: Male_Dio group; Figure 3G: Male_GI group; Figure 3H: Female_Dio group, Male_Gq_group, Male_GI group; Figure 3I: Female_Dio group, Male_Gq group, Male_GI_group). In the revised version, we had changed the sentence &quot;…if the subject showed evidently immobility, the data were excluded…&quot; into “…if the tested subject (not the stimulus voles) showed very little or no movements during the test, the data were excluded from the following analysis…”</p><p>For another, we agree with your opinion that freezing is an important emotional indicator in rodents, but it is seldom occurred in our experiments. A paired conditioned stimulus may elicit such response, which just as in Burkett’s study had done. However, we analyzed self-grooming behavior in our experiments which is another important emotional indicator in rodents (Figure 1—figure supplement 4; Figure 2—figure supplement 1; Figure 3—figure supplement 2; Figure 4; Figure 5 and Figure 6—figure supplement 2).</p><p>Citations</p><p>Burkett, J.

The authors report several behavioral outcome measures in each behavior test. It would be helpful if the authors listed all of the behavioral outcomes measured in the Methods section for each test.

The paper is impressive given the challenges and limitations of implementing many of these techniques in a non-standard model species, such as the mandarin vole. The paper would be strengthened by applying more rigor with respect to interpretation of results and validation of technical approaches.</p><p>1) Throughout the paper the authors refer to empathy-like behaviors, as demonstrated by allogrooming in the consolation test. However, there are marked deficits in general sociability from all their manipulations and no other measures of consolation-specific behaviors, making it likely that effects from inhibition of the DRN→ACC on consolation behaviors are not consolation/empathy-specific, but rather a side effect of disruption of sociability or pro-social behaviors in general. Though this issue is addressed briefly in the discussion, it warrants a more consistent acknowledgment and perhaps a reframing of the paper and the overall interpretation of the results. This does not diminish the importance of the author's findings.</p></disp-quote><p>Thank you very much for your suggestions. Yes, we agree with your viewpoint that the reduced consolation induced by inhibition of the DRN→ACC is likely due to the overall decrease in sociability. However, in the fiber photometry studies, we found both DR 5-HT neurons and ACC 5-HT release showed the largest response during allogrooming (Figure 4—figure supplement 2). Both Burkett’s and our previous study indicated that allogrooming toward a distressed partner is a typical feature of consolation [1,2]. Therefore, we think it is appropriate to say that “DRN→ACC 5-HTergic neural circuit play an important regulatory role in consolation and sociability in mandarin voles”.

However, there are a number of concerns regarding the implementation of the approach and the specificity of the 5-HT signal. a) There is no demonstration that the 5-HT sensor is specifically providing a readout for extracellular 5-HT. Given that this sensor has not been extensively used/published in vivo (and never in voles), it is important to show that an antagonist blocks the behavior-associated changes in fluorescence (or another relevant validation approach). b) It is possible that the correlation in dF/F observed in the PFC and in the raphe is not due to 5-HT in the PFC but instead due to GCaMP expressed in DRN terminals in the PFC. This would be ideally addressed by imaging in DRN and PFC of GCaMP-only animals. However, it is worth noting that these concerns are mitigated by the pharmacological results in Figure 5. c) There is no explanation for how the authors controlled for motion artifacts, which are concerning given that their analysis focuses on active behaviors. Despite referring to &quot;multi-channel fibre [sic] photometry&quot; in the methods, they describe recording using only a 480 nm LED, so cannot take advantage of an isosbestic signal. Showing that GFP-expressing animals do not show reliable changes in dF/F during these behaviors would ameliorate these concerns.</p></disp-quote><p>We appreciate much for these excellent comments！According to your suggestions, we conducted the 5HT sensor and GCAMP6 recordings in separate animals in the revised version (Figure 4, Figure 5). Meanwhile, to validate the selectivity of this 5-HT sensor in mandarin voles, a 5-HT receptor antagonist metergoline (Met) was injected (i.p., 4 mg/kg) before conducting fiber photometry recordings. The results showed that Met completely blocked the fluorescence change of the 5-HT sensor along with allogrooming (Figure 5 figure supplement 2).

In particular, the addition of Bayesian statistics, and the careful rephrasing of conclusions in the light of the Bayesian statistics is very helpful. Intuitively, I would have welcome the inclusion of the key statistics in the figures themselves, rather than in the supplementary 2, but this can be argued either way, and the important factor is that the appropriate statistic is now available and appropriately discussed.</p><p>My only remaining comment, which is a nuance rather than a limitation of the paper, regards the photometry signal. In the initial submission, I was surprised that the signal increase followed rather than preceded the consolation behavior. There is now new data, which provides additional evidence that the signal is robustly increased during the social behavior, and together with all the other causal data, this makes a strong case for a relationship between 5HT and these behaviors. The only nuance that I'm still finding difficult to grasp, is the timing relative to onset of the behavior. In the new version you still write: &quot;Interestingly, we found that the fluorescence changes in GCamP6 and 5-HT sensors usually precede allogrooming and social approaching&quot;. This is what one would hope for. Unfortunately, I cannot quite see the analysis on which this statement is based. A statistical quantification of the signal in the 100ms before the behavior compared to a further distant baseline might do, or something similar, but currently I really do not see statistical data to support the claim. I would thus suggest either to add a statistical analysis for that, or to remove the statement about this precedence. This is true both in the results and the discussion, where you currently write &quot;Interesting, the increased Ca<sup>2+</sup> in DR 5-HT neurons often preceded these behaviors which may indicate the motivational function of 5HT (Arakawa, 2020; Yagishita, 2020)&quot;. On the other hand, you now provide nice evidence that it decreases before the end of the behavior, in line with the idea that it maintains and motivates the behavior somehow.</p></disp-quote><p>Firstly, we appreciate much for your efforts in helping improve our manuscript.
