consisting of deposited beta-amyloid (Aβ), are a neuropathological hallmark of Alzheimer’s Disease (AD). Cerebral vessels play a major role in AD, as Aβ is cleared from the brain by pathways involving the cerebrovasculature, most AD patients have cerebrovascular amyloid (cerebral amyloid angiopathy (CAA), and cardiovascular risk factors increase dementia risk. Here we present a notable advance in vascular tissue engineering by generating the first functional 3-dimensioinal model of CAA in bioengineered human vessels. We show that lipoproteins including brain (apoE) and circulating (high-density lipoprotein, HDL) synergize to facilitate Aβ transport across bioengineered human cerebral vessels. These lipoproteins facilitate Aβ42 transport more efficiently than Aβ40, consistent with Aβ40 being the primary species that accumulates in CAA. Moreover, apoE4 is less effective than apoE2 in promoting Aβ transport, also consistent with the well-established role of apoE4 in Aβ deposition in AD.</p></abstract><abstract abstract-type="executive-summary"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.29595.002</object-id><title>eLife digest</title><p>Alzheimer’s disease causes gradual loss of memory and difficulties in learning. The brains of patients with the disease show several abnormalities including deposits of a peptide molecule called beta-amyloid that is known to be toxic to nerve cells. This peptide can also cause damage to the brain by accumulating within the muscular walls of large blood vessels, a condition known as cerebral amyloid angiopathy (CAA) and is present in most Alzheimer’s disease patients.</p><p>A group of molecules known as lipoproteins, which transport fats throughout body fluids, are thought to be involved in the process by which beta-amyloid leaves the brain. Apolipoprotein E (apoE) is one such molecule and it is made in the brain by cells called astrocytes. There are three different versions of apoE that are associated with different levels of risk of developing Alzheimer’s disease. Other lipoproteins, such as high-density lipoprotein, which is present in the blood, may also play a role in clearing beta-amyloid proteins from the brain. However, it has been difficult to investigate the roles of these lipoproteins in Alzheimer’s disease because current test-tube models do not fully mimic the composition of human brain blood vessels or show how they work.</p><p>Robert et al. have used a tissue engineering approach to generate the first three-dimensional model of human brain blood vessels that can reproduce cerebral amyloid angiopathy. To make the model, different types of human cells similar to those found in real blood vessels and astrocytes were grown under conditions that resemble real-life conditions, including mimicking blood flow through the engineered vessels. Having established that the engineered vessels behaved similarly to normal blood vessels, Robert et al. used them to test whether lipoproteins helped to clear beta-amyloid proteins from the vessels. These experiments showed that a form of apoE that protects against Alzheimer’s disease was more effective in transporting beta-amyloid proteins across the walls of blood vessels than other forms of apoE. Further experiments showed that high-density lipoprotein in the blood and apoE on the brain side of the vessel work together to help transport beta-amyloid into the vessels.</p><p>Together, these findings show that the model of CAA developed by Robert et al. provides a valuable new tool for exploring how this condition develops. The model could also be used more widely in the future, for example, to study how to deliver new drugs that could help treat Alzheimer’s disease into the brain.</p></abstract><kwd-group kwd-group-type="author-keywords"><kwd>Alzheimer disease</kwd><kwd>tissue engineering</kwd><kwd>lipoprotein</kwd><kwd>cerebrovasculature</kwd></kwd-group><kwd-group kwd-group-type="research-organism"><title>Research organism</title><kwd>Human</kwd></kwd-group><funding-group><award-group id="fund1"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution>Weston Brain Institute Rapid Response</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Robert</surname><given-names>Jerome</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund2"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100006312</institution-id><institution>BrightFocus Foundation</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Robert</surname><given-names>Jerome</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund3"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution>Swiss National Science Foundation</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Robert</surname><given-names>Jerome</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund4"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100000024</institution-id><institution>Canadian Institutes of Health Research</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Button</surname><given-names>Emily B</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund5"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100005247</institution-id><institution>University of British Columbia</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Button</surname><given-names>Emily B</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund7"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100000024</institution-id><institution>Canadian Institutes of Health Research</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Wellington</surname><given-names>Cheryl L</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund8"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution>Canadian Consortium of Neurodegeneration and Aging</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Wellington</surname><given-names>Cheryl L</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund9"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution>Djavad Mowafaghian Center for Brain Health Catalyst Grant</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Wellington</surname><given-names>Cheryl L</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund10"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution>Jack Brown and Family Alzheimer's Research Foundation</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Wellington</surname><given-names>Cheryl L</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund11"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution>Y.P.

In addition to AD’s neuropathological hallmarks of amyloid plaques consisting of deposited Aβ peptides and neurofibrillary tangles consisting of hyperphosphorylated tau proteins, 60–90% of AD brains have evidence of cerebral amyloid angiopathy (CAA), cerebral small vessel disease and microvascular degeneration (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Attems and Jellinger, 2014</xref>). Apolipoprotein (apo) E, which in the brain is secreted primarily from astrocytes, is the principal lipid carrier within the central nervous system (CNS) and, in humans, exists as three isoforms, namely <italic>APOE2, APOE3,</italic> and <italic>APOE4</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Lane-Donovan and Herz, 2017</xref>). ApoE has well-established effects on Aβ metabolism with apoE4 being detrimental, apoE3 neutral and apoE2 protective. ApoE is also hypothesized to contribute to cerebrovascular dysfunction (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib55">Zlokovic, 2013</xref>). As the major routes by which Aβ is cleared from the brain involve the cerebrovasculature (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib51">Ueno et al., 2014</xref>), understanding the vascular contributions to dementia is of great interest (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib46">Snyder, 2015</xref>).</p><p>Cardiovascular risk factors including type two diabetes mellitus (T2DM), hypertension, hypercholesterolemia, obesity and stroke increase AD risk (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Duron and Hanon, 2008</xref>), yet the mechanisms by which cardiovascular health impacts brain function remain poorly understood. Interestingly, epidemiological studies suggest that AD risk may be attenuated by high levels of circulating high-density lipoprotein cholesterol (HDL-C), which is also highly associated with reduced cardiovascular disease (CVD) risk (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib56">Zuliani et al., 2010</xref>). Specifically, levels of apoA-I, the major HDL-associated protein, positively correlate with Mini-Mental State Examination (MMSE) and Cognitive Ability Screening Instrument (CASI) scores (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Merched et al., 2000</xref>) and high serum HDL-C levels (&gt;55 mg/dl) in cognitively normal elderly individuals is associated with significantly reduced risk (HR 0.4) of AD even after adjusting for <italic>APOE</italic> genotype and vascular risk factors including obesity and T2DM (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">Reitz et al., 2010</xref>). In symptomatic AD patients, plasma apoA-I levels negatively correlate with hippocampal and whole brain volume as well as mean entorhinal cortical thickness (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Hye et al., 2014</xref>), and decreased levels of serum apoA-I can discriminate AD from non-demented age-matched control subjects (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib45">Shih et al., 2014</xref>). As HDL and apoE have several potent vasoprotective functions including reducing inflammation, increasing vascular tone through promoting endothelial nitric oxide (NO) synthase activity, and suppressing vascular adhesion molecule expression (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib48">Stukas et al., 2014b</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib42">Sacre et al., 2003</xref>), an important goal is to understand how plasma-derived circulating (i.e. HDL) and brain-derived (i.e. apoE) lipoproteins might affect Aβ metabolism in cerebral vessels. However, lipoprotein metabolism in mice and humans are substantially different, as the major circulating lipoprotein in mice is HDL whereas low-density lipoprotein (LDL), which increases CVD risk, is the major circulating lipoprotein in humans (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib54">Yin et al., 2012</xref>). AD animal model studies may therefore not always take into account the inherent vascular resilience of mice compared to humans, and thus may have limits to their translational relevance. Additionally, static in vitro models of human ECs cultured with or without astrocytes do not replicate the complex cellular interactions and extracellular matrix of a native vessel.</p><p>To address some of the key limitations of existing experimental models to investigate the role of lipoproteins on Aβ metabolism at the vessel, we generated three-dimensional (3D) bioengineered human vessels using a scaffold-directed dynamic pulsatile flow bioreactor system, where primary human ECs and smooth muscle cells (SMC) were cultivated in the absence or presence of human astrocytes to generate bipartite or tripartite vessels, respectively, which display the histological features of native peripheral and cerebral arteries. Here we demonstrate the utility of this novel experimental platform to investigate how human lipoproteins affect Aβ transport through and accumulation within physiologically relevant bioengineered human vessels.</p></sec><sec id="s2" sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><sec id="s2-1"><title>Production and anatomical characterization of bioengineered bipartite vessels</title><p>Bipartite bioengineered vessels were fabricated by sequentially seeding primary human myofibroblasts and ECs isolated from umbilical cords into a tubular woven scaffold consisting of polyglycolic acid (PGA), polycaprolactone (PCL) and polylactate (PLA), measuring 15 mm long and 2 mm in diameter (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1</xref>). After 4 weeks in culture, Haematoxylin-Eosin staining demonstrated the formation of a dense and homogenous tissue on the luminal side of the scaffold (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2a</xref>). The tissue was composed of cells and extracellular matrix, as demonstrated by the presence of collagen by Picrosirius staining (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2b</xref>), and confirmed by immunohistochemical detection of collagen IV and laminin in the extracellular matrix (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2c–d</xref>).

Integrity of the endothelial barrier was functionally assessed by injecting Evans blue dye into the bioreactor circulation loop.

To determine if CAA can form in our bioengineered vascular model, we injected monomeric Aβ40 or Aβ42 on the anteluminal side of the vessel to mimic native conditions where Aβ is predominantly produced by neurons. Both ELISA (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3a,b</xref>) and 6E10 immunostaining (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3c–f</xref>) confirmed dose-dependent retention of Aβ40 and Aβ42 within the bioengineered vascular wall 48 hr after injection (white), which could be distinguished from autofluorescence by residual scaffold material (shaded in blue). As Aβ fibrillization within the vessel wall is an important feature of CAA, we also stained vessels using Thioflavin-S (Thio-S), and confirmed dose-dependent fibrillization in the bioengineered vessels (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3e–f</xref>). We further characterized the time course of Aβ accumulation in bioengineered vessels after anteluminal injection of 1 μM monomeric Aβ40 or Aβ42. Both ELISA quantification and 6E10 immunostaining revealed Aβ deposition by 2 hr after injection, after which Aβ levels remained stable for up to 72 hr (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3g–h</xref>). Interestingly, quantification of beta-sheet formation in bioengineered tissue lysates with Thioflavin-T also revealed increasing signal over time (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3i–j</xref>), biochemically confirming increased Aβ fibrillization into beta-sheet structures within bioengineered vessels after seeding of Aβ monomers. Finally, extracellular deposition of amyloid was confirmed by immunofluorescent staining for collagen IV, α-SMA, and Aβ.

As the diameter of our vessels is approximately 2 mm prior to cell seeding and further contains SMC rather than pericytes, our bioengineered tripartite vessels were specifically designed to resemble larger human leptomeningeal and penetrating arteries rather than the cerebral microvasculature. Tripartite bioengineered vessels are therefore composed of EC lining the lumen, several layers of SMC, and a layer of astrocytes in the antelumen as confirmed by immunofluorescent staining against CD31, α-SMC actin, and GFAP, respectively (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6a–c</xref>). Interestingly, higher magnification images revealed GFAP positive protrusions penetrating into the tissue (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6d</xref>), suggestive of astrocyte endfeet. Immunofluorescent staining confirmed the expression of aquaporin four and NDRG2 by astrocytes in bioengineered vessels (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6s1">Figure 6—figure supplement 1a–b</xref>). Importantly, we observed that peripherally-derived ECs (HUVEC), when cultured in the presence of astrocytes and under flow conditions, expressed high level of the tight-junction proteins ZO-1 and ZO-2 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6e–f</xref>) as well as the blood brain barrier (BBB) tight junction protein Claudin 5 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6g</xref>) and the specific BBB transporter Glut-1 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6h</xref>), demonstrating that the EC phenotype of a HUVEC is reprogrammed to become brain-like in the presence of astrocytes. Comparison of Glut-1 expression between bipartite, tripartite, umbilical cord and brain tissues confirmed reprograming of HUVEC in engineered vessels, with expression levels comparable to native brain vessels, whereas native umbilical cords lack detectable Glut-1 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6s2">Figure 6—figure supplement 2</xref>). The integrity of the endothelial barrier in tripartite vessels was functionally assessed by injecting Evans blue into the circulation loop and compared to bipartite vessels. As expected, Evans blue was excluded in both tripartite and bipartite vessels (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6j</xref>). Barrier integrity was further assessed by measuring permeability of 4 kDa or 40 kDa FITC-dextran. Tripartite tissues demonstrated less extravasation of both 4 kDa and 40 kDa than bipartite tissues, although these were not significantly different from each other, whereas, as expected, both tissues are significantly less permeable than unseeded scaffold (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6s3">Figure 6—figure supplement 3</xref>). The functionality of EC and astrocytes within tripartite bioengineered vessels was evaluated by measuring nitric oxide (NO) produced by EC and native apoE secretion by astrocytes, which were genotyped as <italic>APOE3/E3</italic>. To determine NO production, vessels were incubated with either 10 nM of acetylcholine (Ach) or 200 μg/ml of HDL for 60 min before measuring conversion of L-<sup>3</sup>H-arginine to L-<sup>3</sup>H-citruline. A significant increase was observed after both treatments, whereas, in the presence of the specific NO synthase inhibitor L-NG-nitroarginine methyl ester (L-NAME), the conversion was blocked (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6k</xref>).

It is clearly critical to elucidate the mechanisms that regulate Aβ egress from the human brain, as well as understand how to protect cerebrovascular health during aging, yet there are significant barriers toward mechanistic experimentation in a human context. Almost all of our current knowledge about Aβ egress through cerebral vessels has been obtained from animal models, primarily in mice genetically engineered to express human APP, which enables the progressive accumulation of Aβ and β-amyloid to be studied. Despite the tremendous wealth of knowledge generated from animal models, there are considerable challenges in translating these results into humans. For example, many AD risk genes have roles in various aspects of lipid metabolism, the most important of these being <italic>APOE</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Giri et al., 2016</xref>), yet the innate physiological differences between murine and human lipoprotein metabolism (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Getz and Reardon, 2012</xref>) may limit the predictive power of mouse model studies. Although it is well known that humans have three <italic>APOE</italic> allelic variants compared to the single <italic>Apoe</italic> allele in mice, and targeted replacement mice are available that express human <italic>APOE</italic>, there are also other important metabolic distinctions between mice and humans. For example, the primary circulating lipoprotein in rodents is HDL, which, due to its multiple vasoprotective functions, bestows upon mice a natural resilience to cardiovascular diseases such as atherosclerosis. By contrast, the major circulating lipoprotein in humans is LDL, which is mechanistically linked to vascular dysfunction and cardiovascular disease (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Barter et al., 2007</xref>). Despite the wide recognition of the importance of cardiovascular risk factors to AD pathogenesis, they cannot easily or routinely be incorporated into rodent AD models.</p><p>In vitro studies using human cells therefore represent a useful alternative approach, yet most studies of cerebrovascular function use monotypic cultures of brain ECs, which do not mimic the complexity of cell-cell and/or cell-matrix interactions found in the native vessel. As an improvement, EC and astrocytes, EC and SMC, and EC and pericytes have been co-cultured, however, this is almost always under static culture conditions (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Di et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Cho et al., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Bicker et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">Navone et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Man et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Hatherell et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Bussolari et al., 1982</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Cucullo et al., 2007</xref>).

Considerable recent advances in tissue engineering technology have helped to develop microfluidic systems (i.e. ‘organ on a chip’) that recapitulate the 3D complexity of the BBB, primarily to produce small vessel structures like capillaries (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">Prabhakarpandian et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Herland et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Booth and Kim, 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Griep et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Cho et al., 2015</xref>). However, as CAA preferentially forms in larger arteries, we aimed to produce 3D in vitro models of functional human vessels that retain the anatomical and functional properties of native human cerebral arteries. In particular, the pulsatile native-like flow environment possible in our 3D models represents a major advantage over studies using static cell culture. Notably, bioengineered peripheral artery equivalents similar to our bipartite model are clinically used to replace damaged vessels in patients with structural cardiovascular diseases (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib43">Schmidt et al., 2006</xref>). Here we demonstrate the utility of bioengineered vessels to investigate how lipoproteins on the brain side or blood side of the vessel affect Aβ transport and development of CAA, using both bipartite and tripartite engineered vessels. Importantly, the generation of a functional, 3D cerebrovascular model using primary human ECs, SMCs and astrocytes represents a major advance in the bioengineering field.</p><p>To represent human pial, leptomeningial and penetrating cerebral arteries, we reduced the internal diameter of the scaffold to 2 mm compared to previous engineered vessel equivalents (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib43">Schmidt et al., 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib41">Robert et al., 2013a</xref>), while retaining the histologically confirmed architecture of native vessels. Specifically, our bipartite vessels contained a monolayer of ECs forming a hollow lumen, surrounded by multiple layers of α-SMA and secreted extracellular matrix components including collagen and laminin, which demonstrate the in situ functionality of the component cells in the tissue. As a major function of the endothelium is to form a tight barrier between the blood and the interstitial vascular tissue, we also demonstrated the structural integrity of the endothelial layer in bioengineered vessels by demonstrating their impermeability to Evans blue and FITC-Dextran, and confirmed EC function by demonstrating secretion of NO. Furthermore, our completely novel tripartite vessel possessed a layer of GFAP positive astrocytes on the anteluminal side. The formation of structures resembling astrocyte end-feet and secretion of apoE that retains its response to LXR stimulation represent key structural and functional features of astrocytes in healthy cerebral vessels, further supporting the validity of our bioengineered tissue as a valuable new model for mechanistic studies of the human cerebrovasculature. Finally, we observed that the presence of astrocytes induced expression of brain-specific tight junction proteins and transporters in tripartite vessels generated from ECs from a peripheral source, offering the potential to understand how vascular context may reprogram EC phenotype in future studies.</p><p>Numerous studies have demonstrated that the accumulation and aggregation of Aβ within the muscular layer of arteries and arterioles represents a key step in the development of CAA (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Biffi and Greenberg, 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Love, 2009</xref>). We show that our platform can be used to investigate how human lipoproteins on each side of the BBB regulate vascular function and Aβ transport and accumulation. As apoE is the major apolipoprotein expressed in the central nervous system, brain-derived apoE would affect cerebrovascular function from the anteluminal side. By contrast, as apoA-I is produced only in liver and intestine, HDL is found in the circulation and would affect cerebrovascular function from the lumen. Although lipid-free apoA-I can be transported into the brain and is present in CSF (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib47">Stukas et al., 2014a</xref>), there is thus far no evidence that mature HDL might cross the BBB. Our results support a functional cooperation between brain apoE and circulating HDL to promote clearance of Aβ through the cerebral vessel by mechanisms that remain to be fully elucidated. That HDL and apoE consistently affected Aβ42 more than Aβ40 suggests that Aβ40 may be less amenable to lipoprotein-mediated transit across and removal from the vascular wall compared to Aβ42, i.e. Aβ40 is more prone to being retained in the vessel compared to Aβ42. These data are consistent with the observation that Aβ40 is the predominant species found in human CAA (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib53">Yamada, 2015</xref>) even though Aβ42 is reported to be essential for CAA development in mice (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">McGowan et al., 2005</xref>). Our results are also consistent with the hypothesized effects of apoE isoform on vascular function, as we demonstrate that recombinant apoE2 promotes more Aβ42 clearance than recombinant apoE4. Importantly, our platform now provides an opportunity to evaluate potential therapeutic strategies to facilitate Aβ clearance, including approaches that target HDL or apoE.</p><p>Our study, nevertheless, has several limitations. A major limitation is the availability of primary human astrocytes with distinct <italic>APOE</italic> genotypes, although future studies using standardized astrocytes derived from stem cells could be one possible solution. Similarly, how well recombinant apoE resembles native apoE will require additional investigation especially concerning its lipidation status. Furthermore although previous in vivo studies showed that apoE diminishes Aβ clearance in an isoform-specific manner (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Deane et al., 2008</xref>), these analyses were restricted to the transport of preformed Aβ-apoE complexes only and could not differentiate between transport occurring at large vessels versus capillaries. By contrast, our experiments evaluated functional Aβ and apoE interactions under a variety of conditions. Murine and human ECs also differentially clear Aβ with a 30-fold increase of Aβ uptake in mouse cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Qosa et al., 2014</xref>). Together, these observations might explain the differences observed between previously published murine data and our human model. A further limitation is that we used readily obtainable umbilical cord cells due to the slower growth rate and supply of primary cerebrovascular cells. Although one could argue that cord-derived cells do not reflect the physiology of the brain vasculature, we clearly demonstrate that HUVEC become reprogrammed to express selective BBB marker proteins when cultured in tripartite bioengineered vessels and that the histological structure of the vessels as well as Aβ accumulation and transport were similar between brain and cord cellular origins. Another limitation is that HDL was obtained from healthy young donors. As HDL functions can be compromised by aging, cardiovascular disease and T2DM (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">Riwanto and Landmesser, 2013</xref>), it will be important in the future to understand how HDL purified from aged cognitively healthy individuals, AD subjects, or patients with cardiovascular risk factors may affect cerebrovascular function and Aβ accumulation especially in combination with apoE. It should be noted that the concentration of HDL used in the present study is estimated to be 7-fold lower compared to normolipidomic individuals. HDL concentration within the plasma is typically expressed based on its cholesterol content, with normal levels between 40 and 60 mg/dl, which could roughly be translated to 140 mg protein/dL, similar to apoA-I plasma concentration (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Koren et al., 1985</xref>). We circulated 200 μg/mL HDL in our experiments, similar to what has previously been published for other in vitro studies (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Datta et al., 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib41">Robert et al., 2013a</xref>). Although previous in vitro studies have also used similar Aβ levels (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib49">Takamatsu et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib52">Xu et al., 2013</xref>), the Aβ dose used in this study corresponds to a supra physiological concentration of Aβ compared to human brain, CSF or cerebral interstitial fluid, a limitation imposed by the detection limits of our assay (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Brody et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib44">Seubert et al., 1992</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Herukka et al., 2015</xref>) As well, although we could demonstrate that our bioengineered vessels are able to produce NO under physiologically relevant stimuli, our current scaffolding materials are too stiff to permit measurement of vascular compliance. Engineering improvements that explore alternative materials and enable scalable production of bioengineered vessels are also important avenues for future studies. Scalable higher throughput methods are particularly important, as each vessel takes approximately 4 weeks to mature.</p><p>In conclusion, we demonstrate for the first time the feasibility to engineer dynamic 3D human artery equivalents to investigate fundamental AD-relevant cerebrovascular processes in vitro, including CAA and the role of lipoproteins in its prevention. Our experimental platform combines the native-like multilayer 3D architecture of both peripheral and cerebral arterial walls with pulsatile flow profiles through a functional lumen, in a manner that permits delivery and sampling of experimental substrates from either side of the bioengineered vessel. By extending the frontier of vascular tissue engineering into diseases involving the cerebrovasculature, our unique cerebral vessel may facilitate in vitro investigations with higher predictive value for human pathologies than current cellular or animal model approaches, as almost all components of the platform can be experimentally manipulated. For example, drug development and delivery studies can be performed, and the effects of hypertension can be studied by modulating factors such as flow rate and pressure of the circulating media. Plasma or immune cells from specific patient groups can be evaluated for effects on cerebrovascular function, including pre- and post-intervention analyses, to better understand the interactions between cardiovascular factors (i.e. T2DM , hypercholesterolemia, hypertension) and brain factors (i.e. <italic>APOE</italic> genotype). Finally, this platform may also facilitate the discovery of blood biomarkers for central nervous system indications. Further advances in bioengineered cerebral vessels to include other brain cells may ultimately improve translational relevance and provide a valuable complement to in vivo studies in animal models.</p></sec><sec id="s4" sec-type="materials|methods"><title>Materials and methods</title><sec id="s4-1"><title>Cells</title><p>All experiments were conducted under an approved clinical protocol (UBC Clinical Ethics Research Board H13-02719) after obtaining written informed consent from all subjects.

Your article has been reviewed by two peer reviewers, and the evaluation has been overseen by a Reviewing Editor and a Senior Editor. The reviewers have opted to remain anonymous.</p><p>The reviewers have discussed the reviews with one another and the Reviewing Editor has drafted this decision to help you prepare a revised submission.</p><p>Summary:</p><p>In this manuscript Robert et al. describe the development of a three dimensional model of a blood vessel resembling that seen in the brain using bioengineered human blood vessels. They use this model to study transport kinetics of Abeta from the &quot;tissue side&quot; across blood vessels into the luminal side and the effect of apoE isoform as well as circulating HDL on the clearance rate of Abeta40 and Abeta42. They perform this analysis with both monomeric and fibrillar abeta.</p><p>The authors report that ApoE2 is more effective at aiding transport of both Abeta isoforms across blood vessels and that HDL and ApoE work synergistically to make this transport even more effective. Overall this is a robust new in vitro model of blood vessels resembling that seen in brain that can be used to study a wide variety of questions related to CAA, AD and the complex interplay between cardiovascular health and neurodegeneration. While there are some differences with native cerebral arterioles such as using human umbilical derived cells, this is the most physiological in vitro model produced to date that has been developed to study processes related to CAA, AD, and Abeta accumulation and transport to blood vessels.</p><p>Both reviewers and the Reviewing Editor believe that this is an excellent pioneering study that has the potential to revolutionize the mechanistic exploration of amyloid export from the brain across the vasculature and for drug discovery aimed at improving this process. The novelty, the adaptability of the tissue engineering to various genetic constellations and the quality of the data in addition to the high translational value of the method impose an extraordinarily strong suitability for publication in <italic>eLife</italic>.</p><p>Essential revisions:</p><p>1) <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1</xref> is missing.</p><p>2) Regarding transport experiments performed in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3</xref> and beyond, the physiological level of the two Abeta species studied in a normal human/mouse brain is much lower than what is utilized in the manuscript. One μM is supra physiological. It is likely levels like this are required to be able to detect the Abeta. It would be helpful if the authors could point this out as a caveat/shortcoming in the Discussion.</p></body></sub-article><sub-article article-type="reply" id="SA2"><front-stub><article-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.29595.018</article-id><title-group><article-title>Author response</article-title></title-group></front-stub><body><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Essential revisions:</p><p>1) <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1</xref> is missing.</p></disp-quote><p>We apologize for the oversight and thank the reviewers for noticing the missing <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1</xref>.

It would be helpful if the authors could point this out as a caveat/shortcoming in the Discussion.</p></disp-quote><p>We agree with this point. Although local Aβ concentration is difficult to estimate, the concentration used in the present manuscript is indeed supra physiological compared to normal human brain, CSF and cerebral interstitial fluid <sup>1–3</sup>. We were limited to using 1 μM throughout the manuscript to allow quantification of Aβ especially in tripartite vessels or in the presence of lipoproteins where Ab levels were approaching the limit of detection of the ELISA assay used in our study.</p><p>It is also important to note that the HDL concentration used in the manuscript is below normolipidomic plasma concentration. HDL concentration within the plasma is typically expressed as HDL cholesterol content, with normal levels between 40 and 60 mg/dl, which could roughly be translated to 140 mg protein/dL, similar to the apoA-I plasma concentration <sup>4</sup>. The concentration of HDL used in our study (200 ug/mL) is therefore 7-fold lower than the typical plasma concentration, but is consistent to many previously published in vitro studies due to the limitation of the availability of HDL. These two points have been emphasized in the Discussion as potential caveats of our study as follows:</p><p>“Another limitation is that HDL was obtained from healthy young donors. As HDL functions can be compromised by aging, cardiovascular disease and type II diabetes mellitus <sup>5</sup>, it will be important in the future to understand how HDL purified from aged cognitively healthy individuals, AD subjects, or patients with cardiovascular risk factors may affect cerebrovascular function and Aβ accumulation especially in combination with apoE.
