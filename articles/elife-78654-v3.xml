Several TCA cycle components are implicated in tumorigenesis, including loss-of-function mutations in subunits of succinate dehydrogenase (SDH), also known as complex II of the electron transport chain (ETC), but mechanistic understanding of how proliferating cells tolerate the metabolic defects of SDH loss is still lacking. Here, we identify that SDH supports human cell proliferation through aspartate synthesis but, unlike other ETC impairments, the effects of SDH inhibition are not ameliorated by electron acceptor supplementation. Interestingly, we find aspartate production and cell proliferation are restored to SDH-impaired cells by concomitant inhibition of ETC complex I (CI). We determine that the benefits of CI inhibition in this context depend on decreasing mitochondrial NAD+/NADH, which drives SDH-independent aspartate production through pyruvate carboxylation and reductive carboxylation of glutamine. We also find that genetic loss or restoration of SDH selects for cells with concordant CI activity, establishing distinct modalities of mitochondrial metabolism for maintaining aspartate synthesis. These data therefore identify a metabolically beneficial mechanism for CI loss in proliferating cells and reveal how compartmentalized redox changes can impact cellular fitness.</p></abstract><kwd-group kwd-group-type="author-keywords"><kwd>metabolism</kwd><kwd>mitochondria</kwd><kwd>cancer</kwd><kwd>redox</kwd><kwd>aspartate</kwd><kwd>TCA cycle</kwd></kwd-group><kwd-group kwd-group-type="research-organism"><title>Research organism</title><kwd>Human</kwd><kwd>Mouse</kwd></kwd-group><funding-group><award-group id="fund1"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000054</institution-id><institution>National Cancer Institute</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>P30CA015704</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Sullivan</surname><given-names>Lucas B</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund2"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000057</institution-id><institution>National Institute of General Medical Sciences</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>T32GM095421</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Hart</surname><given-names>Madeleine L</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund3"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000054</institution-id><institution>National Cancer Institute</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>R00CA218679-03S1</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Hart</surname><given-names>Madeleine L</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund4"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000054</institution-id><institution>National Cancer Institute</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>R00CA218679</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Sullivan</surname><given-names>Lucas B</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund5"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000057</institution-id><institution>National Institute of General Medical Sciences</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>R35GM147118</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Sullivan</surname><given-names>Lucas B</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund6"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100016611</institution-id><institution>Andy Hill Cancer Research Endowment</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>CARE Award</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Sullivan</surname><given-names>Lucas B</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund7"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000054</institution-id><institution>National Cancer Institute</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>U54CA132381</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Carlisle</surname><given-names>Samantha M</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><funding-statement>The funders had no role in study design, data collection and interpretation, or the decision to submit the work for publication.</funding-statement></funding-group><custom-meta-group><custom-meta specific-use="meta-only"><meta-name>Author impact statement</meta-name><meta-value>SDH-null cancer cells decrease mitochondrial complex I to drive rewired aspartate synthesis through reductive carboxylation and pyruvate carboxylase, supporting cell proliferation and tumor growth.</meta-value></custom-meta></custom-meta-group></article-meta></front><body><sec id="s1" sec-type="intro"><title>Introduction</title><p>Cell proliferation requires metabolic alterations to coordinate catabolism, the maintenance of cellular bioenergetics, with anabolism, the synthesis of macromolecules for cellular replication. Several metabolic pathways serve amphibolic roles, generating both bioenergetic molecules to support metabolic homeostasis, like ATP, NADH, or NADPH, while also producing metabolic precursors used for biosynthesis of molecules such as nucleotides, amino acids, or lipids. Since these metabolic outputs are interconnected, coordinating metabolic pathway activities is critical for efficient cell proliferation. However, specific mechanisms for how metabolic alterations support cell proliferation remain poorly understood, especially in disease contexts where cell lineage, genotype, and environmental factors can all influence metabolic requirements (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib60">Vander Heiden and DeBerardinis, 2017</xref>).</p><p>Central to cell metabolism is the mitochondrion, a double membrane-bound organelle that plays critical roles in cell function. While mitochondria are often viewed through the catabolic lens of efficient ATP synthesis, many proliferating cells can meet their ATP demands from aerobic glycolysis alone yet require intact mitochondrial metabolism for cell proliferation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib63">Weinhouse, 1956</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib56">Tan et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">King and Attardi, 1989</xref>). Two fundamental processes of mitochondrial metabolism are the tricarboxylic acid cycle (TCA) and the electron transport chain (ETC). The TCA cycle is an amphibolic pathway, serving as both the major catabolic source of mitochondrial NADH and as a primary anabolic route supporting aspartate biosynthesis. Metabolite progression through the TCA cycle is linked to ETC activity through two mechanisms: (1) the shared succinate dehydrogenase (SDH, also known as complex II) reaction, and (2) redox coupling, where complex I (CI) accepts electrons from mitochondrial NADH to yield NAD+, in turn driving oxidative TCA cycle reactions that convert NAD +to NADH. Disruptions to ETC complexes I, III, and IV diminish mitochondrial NAD +regeneration, reducing the cellular NAD+/NADH ratio, impairing the TCA cycle, and slowing cell proliferation. Supplementation with molecules that regenerate NAD+, such as pyruvate, alpha-ketobutyrate, or duroquinone, can restore the NAD+/NADH ratio and the proliferation of ETC impaired cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Birsoy et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">Luengo et al., 2021</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib53">Sullivan et al., 2015</xref>). Similarly, heterologous expression of the bacterial NADH oxidase <italic>LbNOX</italic> can also reestablish NADH oxidation independent of the ETC and restore the proliferation of ETC impaired cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib57">Titov et al., 2016</xref>). These findings highlight that redox regulation is an essential function of ETC activity in proliferating cells.</p><p>A major metabolic consequence of decreased NAD+/NADH upon ETC impairment is depletion of the amino acid aspartate (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Birsoy et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib53">Sullivan et al., 2015</xref>). Most cells are dependent on de novo aspartate synthesis since aspartate is poorly permeable at physiological concentrations (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Garcia-Bermudez et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib55">Sullivan et al., 2018</xref>). Aspartate production occurs through transamination of the TCA cycle metabolite oxaloacetate, which is typically produced by NAD+-dependent reactions in the TCA cycle, linking aspartate production to NAD +regeneration by the ETC. Aspartate is a central metabolic node in proliferative metabolism, serving as a direct substrate for protein synthesis and as a precursor for the synthesis of other essential metabolites, including asparagine, arginine, and both purine and pyrimidine nucleobases. Thus, aspartate depletion likely impairs core metabolic processes necessary for cell proliferation. Indeed, providing cells with exogenous sources of aspartate circumvents the proliferative defects of impairments to complexes I, III, and IV without correcting the NAD+/NADH imbalance, indicating that ETC impairments block cell proliferation primarily by suppressing aspartate synthesis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Birsoy et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib53">Sullivan et al., 2015</xref>). Nonetheless, it remains unclear how alterations to other components of mitochondrial metabolism affect redox homeostasis and aspartate production, as well as how cells with mitochondrial dysfunction may adapt to the disruption of canonical aspartate production pathways.</p><p>The dual ETC/TCA cycle enzyme SDH serves important functions in mitochondrial metabolism yet is also a target of biological disruption. SDH is a heterotetrameric nuclear-encoded protein complex located in the inner mitochondrial membrane (IMM) that catalyzes the oxidation of succinate to fumarate and shuttles electrons to ubiquinone in the ETC. Biallelic loss-of-function mutations to the subunits of SDH (A-D) or SDH assembly factors (SDHAF1-2), can lead to neoplasms in neuroendocrine tissues and the kidney (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Astuti et al., 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Bardella et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Baysal et al., 2000</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Burnichon et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Hao et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib42">Niemann and MÃ¼ller, 2000</xref>). Cancer cells arising from mutations in SDH components typically display a complete loss of oxidative TCA cycle metabolism at the SDH step and have a substantial accumulation of the upstream metabolite succinate, which can impair enzymes involved in oxygen sensing, epigenetic regulation, and metabolism (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">LetouzÃ© et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib54">Sullivan et al., 2016</xref>). SDH loss also blocks the canonical route for aspartate biosynthesis, making it unclear how SDH-deficient cells adapt to fulfill their anabolic demands for cell proliferation. Understanding how SDH-deficient cancer cells reconfigure their metabolism to support cell proliferation will help reveal the normal metabolic roles of SDH and could support the development of novel therapies targeting the unique metabolic liabilities of SDH-mutant cancers.</p><p>Here, we investigate the consequences of acute and chronic SDH deficiency and observe that SDH impairment causes aspartate-dependent proliferation defects. However, unlike impairments to other ETC complexes, exogenous electron acceptors are insufficient to restore aspartate levels and cell proliferation to SDH-deficient cells. Surprisingly, we find that additional impairment to CI is required to enable aspartate synthesis and cell proliferation in SDH-deficient cells. Specifically, we find that CI inhibition decreases mitochondrial NAD+/NADH, which drives pyruvate carboxylation and reductive carboxylation of glutamine-derived alpha-ketoglutarate (AKG) to generate precursors for aspartate synthesis in the cytosol, thereby supporting proliferation in SDH-impaired cells. Finally, we observe that disrupting or restoring SDH prompts selective pressure for progressive changes in CI activity to directly correspond to SDH activity, identifying distinct metabolic states that enable aspartate production. Altogether, our data reveal a metabolic mechanism where compartmentalized redox changes are required to enact alternative aspartate biosynthetic pathways that support cell proliferation during TCA cycle dysfunction.</p></sec><sec id="s2" sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><sec id="s2-1"><title>SDH inhibition impairs proliferation, which is partially restored by electron acceptors but robustly restored by aspartate</title><p>To understand the metabolic contributions of SDH/complex II (hereafter, SDH) to cell proliferation, we compared the proliferative consequences of the inhibitors atpenin A5 (AA5), a specific inhibitor of SDH, and the classic CI inhibitor rotenone in the respiration-intact osteosarcoma cell line 143B. Both inhibitors effectively blocked cell proliferation when cultured in media without electron acceptors (DMEM without pyruvate), consistent with an essential role of mitochondrial metabolism in support of cell proliferation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1A</xref>). Previous work from us and others identified that supplementation with the exogenous electron acceptors pyruvate (PYR) or alpha-ketobutyrate (AKB) can restore proliferation to cells with CI impairments by regenerating NAD +to support aspartate biosynthesis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Birsoy et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib53">Sullivan et al., 2015</xref>). While we confirm that PYR and AKB can robustly restore proliferation upon rotenone treatment, proliferation of AA5 treated cells was only modestly improved by electron acceptor supplementation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1A</xref>). In contrast, aspartate supplementation equivalently, albeit incompletely, restored cell proliferation to both rotenone and AA5-treated cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1A</xref>). Aspartate is poorly permeable to most cells even at supraphysiological concentrations, so we generated 143B cells expressing the glial-specific aspartate transporter SLC1A3, which we confirm supports aspartate uptake at micromolar extracellular concentrations (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1âfigure supplement 1AâC</xref>). Notably, improved aspartate uptake with SLC1A3 expression allowed aspartate to fully restore proliferation upon AA5 treatment, regardless of PYR co-treatment (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1âfigure supplement 1D</xref>). Similarly, orthogonal aspartate acquisition by intracellular expression of the guinea pig asparaginase (gpASNase1) combined with asparagine treatment was also able to restore proliferation to AA5-treated cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1âfigure supplement 1EâG</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib55">Sullivan et al., 2018</xref>). These data indicate that aspartate is a primary metabolic limitation of SDH-impaired cells, consistent with previous findings (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Cardaci et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">Lussey-Lepoutre et al., 2015</xref>). However, these data also indicate that the metabolic determinants of aspartate limitation upon SDH inhibition are distinct from those of CI loss.</p><fig-group><fig id="fig1" position="float"><label>Figure 1.</label><caption><title>SDH inhibition blocks proliferation, which is incompletely rescued by electron acceptors but robustly restored by aspartate.</title><p>(<bold>A</bold>) Proliferation rates of 143B cells treated with vehicle (DMSO), 50 nM rotenone, or 5 ÂµM atpenin A5 (AA5) cultured in pyruvate free DMEM with no addition, 1 mM pyruvate (PYR), 1 mM alpha-ketobutyrate (AKB), or 20 mM aspartate (ASP).

As expected for SDH impairment, AA5 treatment caused succinate accumulation and depleted fumarate levels (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1âfigure supplement 1H and I</xref>). Consistent with aspartate being the mediator of proliferation defects from either inhibitor, aspartate levels were depleted by both drugs, fully restored by pyruvate in rotenone treated cells, and only partially increased in cells treated with AA5 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1B</xref>). Thus, although either inhibitor is associated with proliferation defects corresponding with aspartate levels, CI impairments have distinct metabolic phenotypes from SDH inhibition.</p><p>While intracellular aspartate levels correlate with proliferation rate in our datasets of mitochondrial impaired cells, the quantitative relationship between the two is non-linear making it unclear how to predict the degree to which changes in aspartate levels will constitute a functionally meaningful change for proliferation rate (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1A and B</xref>). To contextualize these findings, we generated a dose response curve measuring the effects of a range of rotenone concentrations on proliferation rate and intracellular aspartate levels, comparing them to SDH inhibition by AA5, with or without PYR treatment (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1âfigure supplement 1K and L</xref>). Notably, combining these datasets revealed that the correlation between proliferation rate and aspartate levels was consistent across inhibitors and environmental conditions, manifesting as a hyperbolic relationship (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1C</xref>). These data are consistent with a model where the phenotypic consequences for changes in aspartate levels depend on the degree to which aspartate limits proliferative cell metabolism. Basal conditions are not aspartate-limited and so decreases in aspartate will only have a small effect on cell proliferation; however, as aspartate becomes metabolically limited (around 0.4, compared to vehicle treated cells in media containing PYR), changes in aspartate have more severe consequences on cell proliferation, until aspartate levels are insufficient to support proliferation (around 0.05). These data therefore provide critical context to understand how changes in aspartate levels correspond to proliferation upon mitochondrial inhibition.</p><p>We next investigated how each inhibitor affects intracellular NAD+/NADH, a critical mediator of the effects of CI inhibition on aspartate levels and cell proliferation. Unlike with rotenone treatment, AA5 treatment was not associated with suppression of NAD+/NADH, breaking the direct correlation between NAD+/NADH, aspartate levels, and proliferation rate seen with rotenone and other CI inhibitors (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1D</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Gui et al., 2016</xref>). Pyruvate supplementation increased NAD+/NADH in all cases; restoring NAD+/NADH in rotenone treated cells to near vehicle-treated levels and increasing NAD+/NADH beyond vehicle treated cells upon AA5 treatment (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1D</xref>). These data are consistent with a model where CI impairments suppress aspartate production by lowering NAD+/NADH and thereby slowing the oxidative TCA cycle, whereas SDH inhibition directly blocks the oxidative TCA cycle, impairing aspartate synthesis and NADH production (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1E</xref>). Indeed, we measured M+4 aspartate in cells cultured in U-<sup>13</sup>C glutamine, reflective of aspartate produced via canonical oxidative TCA cycle activity and found that pyruvate treatment restores metabolic progression through the TCA cycle in rotenone-treated cells but not in cells treated with AA5 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1âfigure supplement 1J</xref>).</p><p>We also evaluated the metabolic effects of alterations to SDH activity in UOK269 cells, a patient derived renal cell carcinoma cell line that arose from a heterozygous point mutation (R46Q) in SDHB and deletion of the other allele (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib49">Saxena et al., 2016</xref>). Re-expression of wild type SDHB in UOK269 cells had the expected metabolic effects by alleviating the accumulation of succinate and increasing aspartate levels (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1F</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1âfigure supplement 1M and N</xref>). Similar to 143B cells, an intact TCA cycle ameliorated the dependence of UOK269 cells on pyruvate or aspartate for cell proliferation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1G</xref>). However, in contrast to AA5 treated 143B cells, pyruvate and aspartate treatment were equally effective at restoring cell proliferation in UOK269 cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1G</xref>). These data suggest that long-term SDH loss may be associated with metabolic adaptations that allow cells to fully take advantage of exogenous electron acceptors to restore aspartate and cell proliferation.</p></sec><sec id="s2-2"><title>CI inhibition promotes aspartate synthesis and cell proliferation in SDH-deficient cancer cells</title><p>We next questioned what metabolic adaptations may occur in SDH-deficient cells to promote cell proliferation. Intriguingly, several cell lines generated with genetic defects in SDH components have diminished respiration rates (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Cardaci et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Lorendeau et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib49">Saxena et al., 2016</xref>). Since CI and SDH are functionally independent contributors to the ETC, and CI-derived electrons account for the majority of respiration, it is not inherently obvious that SDH-deficient cells would be unable to maintain robust respiration activity. In support of this, we found that treatment with AA5 only partially impairs respiration after several hours of treatment, whereas rotenone severely abrogates respiration within minutes (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s1">Figure 2âfigure supplement 1A</xref>). One potential explanation for the respiration loss in SDH-mutant cells is the observation that they manifest with decreased CI expression and activity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Cardaci et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Lorendeau et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib49">Saxena et al., 2016</xref>). Indeed, it was reported that dual inhibition of SDH and CI is required to mimic the metabolic phenotype of SDH-mutant cancer cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Lorendeau et al., 2017</xref>). Nonetheless, while these data suggest that CI loss may serve a metabolic role in SDH-deficient cells, no functional benefit for CI loss in this context has yet been described.</p><p>We tested if, in the presence of electron acceptors, rotenone could alter the proliferation of cells treated with AA5 and, surprisingly, found it caused a robust restoration of cell proliferation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2A</xref>). Since aspartate levels define the proliferation rate of SDH-impaired cells, we then measured aspartate levels and found that CI co-inhibition partially restored aspartate to SDH-impaired cells to a level consistent with their improved proliferation rate (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1C</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2B</xref>). CI co-inhibition also restored proliferation and increased aspartate levels across a panel of diverse human cell lines treated with AA5, including both transformed (A549, HCT116) and non-transformed (293T, TF-1) cells, indicating that this metabolic relationship was generalizable (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s1">Figure 2âfigure supplement 1B and C</xref>). To test these effects genetically, we used CRISPR/Cas9 to generate gene knockouts (KO) of SDHB, the most frequently mutated subunit in SDH-null human cancers (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Amar et al., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Badenhop et al., 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Klein et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Linehan and Ricketts, 2013</xref>). While we were able to achieve efficient disruption of SDHB, with ~96% loss in 143B cells, we were initially unable to generate single-cell SDHB KO clones in standard media (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2C</xref>). Based on our previous observations, we repeated colony selection with or without rotenone and found that CI inhibition was sufficient for successful generation of clones from Cas9/sgSDHB nucleofected 143B cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2D</xref>). Notably, every tested clone generated in this manner was devoid of SDHB expression (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2E</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s1">Figure 2âfigure supplement 1D</xref>). We also found that AA5 treatment of an SDHB KO clone had no significant effects on proliferation, aspartate levels or the NAD+/NADH ratio, indicating on-target effects of AA5 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s1">Figure 2âfigure supplement 1G</xref>). In each SDHB KO cell line generated, proliferation was slowed relative to their parental cells but was improved by treatment with the CI inhibitors rotenone or metformin, or by supplementation with aspartate (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2F</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s1">Figure 2âfigure supplement 1H</xref>). We also restored SDHB expression in a KO clone and found that it rescued proliferation to parental rates and reinstated wild type relationships with rotenone and AA5 treatment (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s1">Figure 2âfigure supplement 1I and J</xref>). We then measured aspartate levels in WT and SDHB KO cells with or without rotenone treatment and found that rotenone decreases aspartate levels in WT cells but increases aspartate in SDHB KO cells, consistent with proliferation restoration (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2G</xref>). Finally, to test if this metabolic relationship was an artifact of our cell culture media choice, which contains high levels of pyruvate, we also tested the effects of SDH inhibition in 143B cells cultured in Human Plasma-Like Media (HPLM), which closely matches the nutrient composition of human plasma (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Cantor et al., 2017</xref>). We found that AA5 still impaired cell proliferation and that rotenone or aspartate co-treatment restored cell proliferation in HPLM (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s1">Figure 2âfigure supplement 1K</xref>).

CI activity contributes to several metabolic processes, including NADH oxidation, mitochondrial membrane potential generation, and the reduction of ubiquinone (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s1">Figure 3âfigure supplement 1A</xref>). To ascertain which of these processes is deleterious to SDH-deficient cells, we co-treated cells with AA5 and conditions that target other aspects of the ETC and oxidative phosphorylation. While rotenone directly inhibits CI, the complex III inhibitor Antimycin A similarly impairs NADH oxidation and mitochondrial membrane potential generation but differs from CI inhibition by preventing ubiquinol oxidation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s1">Figure 3âfigure supplement 1A</xref>). Oligomycin blocks the IMM complex ATP synthase, inhibiting mitochondrial membrane potential utilization, inducing hyperpolarization of the IMM, and thereby causing collateral inhibition of ETC activity. Oligomycin treatment therefore similarly impairs NADH oxidation but differs from CI inhibitors by increasing the mitochondrial membrane potential and slowing electron flux through all three proton pumping complexes (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s1">Figure 3âfigure supplement 1A</xref>). Lastly, hypoxia limits the terminal electron acceptor activity of complex IV, slowing upstream ETC function (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s1">Figure 3âfigure supplement 1A</xref>). Importantly, we found that treatment with antimycin or oligomycin can substitute for CI inhibitors, albeit less effectively, to restore the proliferation and aspartate levels of AA5 treated cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s1">Figure 3âfigure supplement 1B and C</xref>). Gratifyingly, since complex III inhibition collaterally impairs both complex I and II, antimycin treatment alone had near identical effects on aspartate levels and proliferation as AA5 and rotenone cotreatment (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s1">Figure 3âfigure supplement 1B and C</xref>). Finally, culturing cells in severe hypoxia (1%) was sufficient to improve the proliferation of SDH-impaired cells, albeit to a smaller degree than CI inhibition, while physiological O<sub>2</sub> tensions (3â11%) had little effect on the proliferation of AA5 treated cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s1">Figure 3âfigure supplement 1D</xref>). Collectively, these results suggest that the shared effect of each treatment on mitochondrial NAD+/NADH, rather than other downstream effects on ETC function, is likely a primary mechanism by which ETC inhibition supports aspartate production and proliferation in SDH-deficient cells.</p><p>To investigate how CI inhibition changes the redox state of SDH-impaired cells, we measured the effects of co-inhibition on NAD+/NADH by LCMS. While AA5 treatment alone increased NAD+/NADH in the presence of pyruvate, as in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1D</xref>, the effects of rotenone co-treatment were epistatic to AA5 treatment and reduced cellular NAD+/NADH to that of cells treated with rotenone alone (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3A</xref>). The increase in NAD+/NADH in cells upon SDH impairment alone is thus likely a consequence of decreased NADH production in the TCA cycle coinciding with persisting NADH oxidation by active mitochondrial CI. We next adapted a selective membrane permeabilization protocol to rapidly isolate and extract metabolites from the cytosol and mitochondria and used an enzymatic assay that enables low sample inputs to measure NAD+/NADH in each compartment (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s1">Figure 3âfigure supplement 1E</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Lee et al., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib53">Sullivan et al., 2015</xref>).

To do so, we expressed cytosolic or mitochondrial-targeted FLAG-tagged <italic>Lactobacillus brevis</italic> NADH oxidase (cyto<italic>LbNOX</italic>/mito<italic>LbNOX</italic>) in 143B cells, an enzyme that directly utilizes molecular oxygen to oxidize NADH to NAD +without requiring ETC function or other carbon substrates (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3C</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib57">Titov et al., 2016</xref>). Subcellular fractionation and immunoblotting verified successful subcellular targeting, as each construct was enriched in its expected compartment (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3D</xref>). Notably, since these cells are cultured in the presence of the cytosolic electron acceptor pyruvate, we thus expected cyto<italic>LbNOX</italic> to be redundant and ineffective to change cell metabolism, whereas mitoLbNOX would be positioned to disrupt the mitochondrial redox changes from rotenone treatment. Indeed, whereas cells expressing cyto<italic>LbNOX</italic> behaved similarly to parental cells expressing eGFP, mito<italic>LbNOX</italic> expression impeded the restorative effect of rotenone treatment on SDH-impaired cell proliferation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3E</xref>). Moreover, the increase in aspartate levels upon rotenone co-treatment was similarly diminished by mito<italic>LbNOX</italic> expression, but not by cyto<italic>LbNOX</italic> expression (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3F</xref>). These data indicate that decreased mitochondrial NAD+/NADH is required for the benefits of CI inhibition when SDH is impaired.</p><p>We next asked if decreased mitochondrial NAD+/NADH was sufficient to improve SDH-deficient cell function without CI inhibition. Another determinant of mitochondrial NAD+/NADH is the pyruvate dehydrogenase (PDH) reaction, which converts NAD +to NADH (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s2">Figure 3âfigure supplement 2A</xref>). The drug AZD7545 can disinhibit PDH to increase its activity by blocking regulation by pyruvate dehydrogenase kinases (PDKs) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">Morrell et al., 2003</xref>). In the context of electron acceptor limitation, AZD7545 can further drive down NAD+/NADH and impair cell function (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">Luengo et al., 2021</xref>) however, our data indicate that lowering mitochondrial NAD+/NADH is beneficial in SDH-deficient cells, so we hypothesized that AZD7545 may instead provide a benefit in this context. To ensure that the AZD7545 mechanism of action functions independently of CI inhibition, we confirmed that AZD7545 treatment does not impair mitochondrial oxygen consumption in AA5 treated cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s2">Figure 3âfigure supplement 2B</xref>). Additionally, AA5 treated cells co-treated with AZD7545 maintained and marginally increased <sup>13</sup>C glucose-derived cis-aconitate levels, whereas rotenone co-treatment depleted them, highlighting the distinct mechanisms by which these inhibitors drive mitochondrial metabolic changes (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s2">Figure 3âfigure supplement 2C</xref>). Importantly, treatment with AZD7545 also slightly improved cell proliferation and increased aspartate levels in AA5-treated cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s2">Figure 3âfigure supplement 2D and E</xref>). Notably, these effects are likely limited by the fact that they are occurring in the presence of intact CI activity, which would likely buffer major changes in mitochondrial NAD+/NADH. Nonetheless, these data provide additional support that compartment-specific mitochondrial redox alterations are both sufficient and required to reprogram aspartate synthesis in SDH-impaired cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3G</xref>).</p></sec><sec id="s2-4"><title>Mitochondrial redox alterations promote alternative aspartate synthesis pathways in SDH-impaired cells</title><p>While our results demonstrate that decreased mitochondrial NAD+/NADH is a critical driver of aspartate synthesis in SDH-impaired cells, it remains unclear how these redox changes induce aspartate production. One likely contributor is reductive carboxylation of glutamine-derived AKG (RCQ), whose relative contribution to aspartate production is increased in cells with defects in oxidative mitochondrial metabolism (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">Metallo et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib40">Mullen et al., 2011</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib41">Mullen et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib66">Wise et al., 2011</xref>). Another is pyruvate carboxylase (PC), which can have increased expression and activity in SDH-null cancer cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Cardaci et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">Lussey-Lepoutre et al., 2015</xref>). To ascertain the source of increased aspartate in SDH-deficient cells upon CI inhibition we conducted stable isotope labeling of WT and low passage SDHB KO cells with or without rotenone from U-<sup>13</sup>C glutamine, which can delineate between aspartate generated from the oxidative TCA cycle or RCQ (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4A</xref>). SDHB KO decreased total aspartate levels and abolished oxidative M+4 aspartate production, as expected, and RCQ-derived M+3 aspartate was slightly increased in SDHB KO cells upon rotenone treatment (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4A and B</xref>). While RCQ can occur in both the cytoplasmic and mitochondrial compartments through IDH1 and IDH2, respectively, both RCQ routes rely on ATP-citrate lyase (ACLY) to cleave cytosolic citrate to oxaloacetate (OAA) and acetyl-CoA (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s1">Figure 4âfigure supplement 1A</xref>). Therefore, we tested if preventing RCQ with the ACLY inhibitor BMS-303141 (BMS) would alter the proliferation rescue of CI inhibition in SDH-impaired 143B cells. Indeed, BMS had an anti-proliferative effect on AA5 and rotenone co-treated cells, which could be prevented by aspartate supplementation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4C</xref>). Correspondingly, aspartate levels were decreased in SDH/CI inhibited cells when treated with BMS, tracking with the small contribution of RCQ to aspartate production in this context (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4B and D</xref>). These data indicate that RCQ is partially responsible for increased aspartate synthesis and cell proliferation upon CI inhibition in SDH-impaired cells.</p><fig-group><fig id="fig4" position="float"><label>Figure 4.</label><caption><title>Reductive carboxylation and pyruvate carboxylation drive aspartate synthesis in SDH impaired cells upon CI inhibition.</title><p>(<bold>A</bold>) Schematic depicting metabolic pathway usage for isotopologue patterns of aspartate derived from U-<sup>13</sup>C glutamine.

To avoid potential caveats that may confound labeling patterns from unlabeled media pyruvate, we conducted U-<sup>13</sup>C glucose isotope tracing experiments in pyruvate-free DMEM with AKB, which serves a similar electron acceptor function as pyruvate but cannot fulfill its carbon fates (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1A</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Altea-Manzano et al., 2022</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib53">Sullivan et al., 2015</xref>). We also confirmed that rotenone is still effective to restore proliferation and aspartate levels of SDH-impaired cells in pyruvate-free DMEM with AKB (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s1">Figure 4âfigure supplement 1B and C</xref>). While glucose-derived carbon was a minor contributor to aspartate in WT cells, the majority of aspartate in vehicle-treated SDHB KO cells was labeled M+3 from glucose, as was most of the aspartate induced by rotenone treatment (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4F</xref>). We next investigated the functional contributions of PC to SDH-impaired cells, with or without CI co-inhibition. First, we generated monoclonal PC KO 143B cells, and to control for variation from single cell cloning, we re-expressed PC cDNA in a KO clone to generate PC âaddbackâ (AB) cells to serve as a metabolically wild type control (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4G</xref>). Consistent with previously published results, we find that PC KO cells are sensitive to SDH impairment (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4H</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Cardaci et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">Lussey-Lepoutre et al., 2015</xref>). Interestingly, rotenone treatment still provided a proliferative benefit to AA5-treated PC KO cells, although the resultant proliferation rate was still decreased compared to PC AB cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4H</xref>). We hypothesized that this residual proliferation benefit was driven by existing or compensatory RCQ activity, so we added BMS to SDH/CI inhibited PC KO cells, which was sufficient to completely block cell proliferation and was ameliorated by aspartate treatment (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4H</xref>). Consistent with the proliferation defects, BMS treatment also blocked the increase in aspartate levels upon rotenone treatment in SDH-impaired PC KO cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4I</xref>). Collectively, these data demonstrate that both alternative aspartate synthesis pathways, RCQ and PC, contribute to aspartate levels and cell proliferation during SDH deficiency and are activated by CI impairment (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4J</xref>).</p></sec><sec id="s2-5"><title>Mitochondrial pyruvate entry is essential for alternative aspartate synthesis pathways</title><p>Both PC and RCQ have reactions that can occur in the cytosol or mitochondria, obfuscating the mechanism by which mitochondrial redox changes from CI inhibition might drive alternative aspartate synthesis pathways in SDH-impaired cells.

Glutamate conversion to AKG can conventionally occur via three mitochondrial enzymes: GDH, which consumes glutamate and NAD +to generate AKG, NADH, and ammonia; GOT2, which converts glutamate and OAA to aspartate and AKG; and GPT2, which converts glutamate and pyruvate to AKG and alanine. The requirement for MPC1 to maintain AKG levels suggests that pyruvate-dependent GPT2 activity is a dominant route for AKG production in these cells, consistent with recent studies (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5s1">Figure 5âfigure supplement 1A</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib47">Rossiter et al., 2021</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib61">Wei et al., 2022</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib62">Weinberg et al., 2010</xref>). Indeed, MPC1 KO was also associated with a decrease in alanine levels, corroborating studies that identify GPT2 as a dominant source of alanine production (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5s1">Figure 5âfigure supplement 1B</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib47">Rossiter et al., 2021</xref>). While AA5 treatment did not alter AKG levels in MPC1 KO cells, the addition of rotenone co-treatment was associated with further depletion of AKG, but not alanine, suggesting that rotenone blocked the secondary path of AKG generation through redox changes that impair the NAD +consuming GDH reaction (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5E</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5s1">Figure 5âfigure supplement 1B</xref>). Together, these data support the hypothesis that a reduced mitochondrial environment promotes alternative aspartate synthesis in SDH-deficient cells through activating RCQ and PC activity, both of which require mitochondrial pyruvate import (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5F</xref>).</p></sec><sec id="s2-6"><title>Alternative aspartate synthesis upon CI inhibition in SDH-impaired cells is dependent on GOT1</title><p>Since alternative aspartate synthesis pathways occur across intracellular compartments, it is unclear whether aspartate transamination occurs in SDH-impaired cells via the cytosolic glutamic-oxaloacetic transaminase (GOT) isoform GOT1 or its mitochondrial counterpart GOT2. On one hand, the mitochondrial enzymes MPC and PC are required for aspartate synthesis in this context, indicating that aspartate production by GOT2 is a plausible path. Indeed, GOT2-mediated aspartate production is observed in wild-type cells using the oxidative TCA cycle for aspartate synthesis and in hypoxic pancreatic cancer cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Garcia-Bermudez et al., 2022</xref>). However, RCQ derived OAA is produced in the cytosol, suggesting GOT1 may also drive aspartate synthesis, as has been described in cells with other mitochondrial disruptions (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Birsoy et al., 2015</xref>). Therefore, we next asked whether CI inhibition drives aspartate production in SDH-impaired cells by GOT2 or GOT1. We first generated monoclonal 143B cells with GOT2 KO and re-expressed GOT2 to generate a paired GOT2 AB cell line (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6A</xref>). Consistent with published phenotypes, GOT2 KO cells were unable to proliferate in pyruvate-free media (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6s1">Figure 6âfigure supplement 1A</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Garcia-Bermudez et al., 2022</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Kerk et al., 2022</xref>). In our standard media containing pyruvate, we found that GOT2 KO cells have increased sensitivity to SDH inhibition alone but maintained the benefits of CI co-inhibition on proliferation rate and aspartate production, similar to GOT2 AB and WT cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6B and C</xref>). The enhanced depletion of aspartate upon AA5 treatment in GOT2 KO cells was also functionally related to its stronger proliferation impairment phenotype, as aspartate supplementation was able to phenocopy the proliferation benefits of rotenone co-treatment (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6D</xref>). These data indicate that residual aspartate production in SDH-impaired cells is primarily driven by GOT2, but GOT2 is dispensable for the induction of aspartate production in SDH-impaired cells upon CI inhibition.</p><fig-group><fig id="fig6" position="float"><label>Figure 6.</label><caption><title>GOT1 is required for increased aspartate synthesis in SDH impaired cells upon complex I co-inhibition.</title><p>(<bold>A</bold>) Western blot for GOT2 and Vinculin from WT 143B cells, GOT2 KO 143B cells, and the same GOT2 KO clone expressing GOT2 cDNA (AB).

GOT1 KO cells had a mild proliferation defect compared to GOT1 AB or WT cells, but unlike GOT2 KO cells they were not obviously sensitized to AA5 treatment (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6F</xref>). Importantly, SDH-impaired GOT1 KO cells differed from GOT1 AB and WT cells in that CI inhibition no longer provided a proliferative benefit (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6F</xref>). Correspondingly, aspartate levels were suppressed by SDH impairment in both GOT1 KO and GOT1 AB cell lines, but CI co-inhibition only increased aspartate levels in GOT1 replete cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6G</xref>). Notably, CI inhibition still increased malate levels in SDH-impaired GOT1 KO cells, suggesting that the mitochondrial redox changes from CI inhibition still drive the biochemical pathways required for alternative aspartate synthesis in these cells (i.e. PC and RCQ), but that GOT1 is required for terminal aspartate generation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6s1">Figure 6âfigure supplement 1B</xref>). These data also suggest that cytosolic malate dehydrogenase (MDH1) may play a role in alternative aspartate synthesis upstream of GOT1, so we also generated monoclonal MDH1 KO and paired MDH1 AB cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6s1">Figure 6âfigure supplement 1C and D</xref>). Similar to GOT1 KO cells, we found that neither proliferation rate nor aspartate levels were restored by CI inhibition in SDH-impaired MDH1 KO cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6s1">Figure 6âfigure supplement 1E and F</xref>). Interestingly, baseline aspartate levels were elevated in both GOT1 KO and MDH1 KO cells, consistent with their conventional aspartate-consuming role in the malate-aspartate shuttle (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6G</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6s1">Figure 6âfigure supplement 1F</xref>). However, the observation that GOT1 KO or MDH1 KO prevents CI inhibition from restoring aspartate levels in SDH-impaired cells indicates a reversal of the malate-aspartate shuttle to synthesize aspartate in SDH/CI impaired cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6s1">Figure 6âfigure supplement 1C</xref>). Finally, we found that the inability of CI inhibition to restore the proliferation of SDH-impaired GOT1 KO cells was due to its lack of aspartate restoration, as aspartate rescues proliferation of SDH/CI impaired GOT1 KO cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6H</xref>). The effects of each metabolic gene disruption on cell proliferation during SDH or SDH/CI inhibition were also replicated across additional KO clones (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6s1">Figure 6âfigure supplement 1G</xref>). Collectively, these results indicate that in SDH-impaired cells, CI inhibition increases mitochondrial NADH to drive alternative aspartate synthesis pathways via PC and RCQ, both of which yield cytosolic oxaloacetate that is converted to aspartate by GOT1 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6I</xref>). Notably, in the case of PC-derived aspartate, the divergent NAD+/NADH ratios in each compartment would support reversal of mitochondrial malate dehydrogenase (MDH2) to reduce OAA to malate, which can be exported to the cytosol and oxidized to OAA by MDH1 prior to transamination to aspartate by GOT1 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6I</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6s1">Figure 6âfigure supplement 1C</xref>).</p></sec><sec id="s2-7"><title>SDHB-null cells adapt through progressive complex I loss</title><p>While conducting these studies, we also generated a monoclonal SDHB KO HEK293T cell line, which, as expected, had a proliferation defect that was ameliorated by CI inhibition (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7s1">Figure 7âfigure supplement 1A and B</xref>). Interestingly, after several months of passaging, we observed that the basal proliferation rate of SDHB KO HEK293T cells progressively increased, and that the proliferation benefit of CI inhibition was lost (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7s1">Figure 7âfigure supplement 1B</xref>). To understand this phenomenon, we created three categories of cell lines derived from one 143B SDHB KO clone: Early Passage (EP) SDHB KO,&lt;5 passages; Late Passage (LP) SDHB KO,&gt;15 passages; or Addback (AB), where SDHB was re-expressed immediately after SDHB KO clone generation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7A</xref>). We measured proliferation rates of parental cells (WT), AB, EP SDHB KO and LP SDHB KO cells and found that SDHB KO decreased their proliferation rate, but that culturing SDHB KO cells to LP allowed them to adapt to an improved proliferation rate (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7B</xref>). Culturing EP SDHB KO cells in the presence of rotenone or aspartate was able to improve cell proliferation, consistent with the effects of acute SDH inhibition with AA5; however, those benefits were largely lost in LP SDHB KO cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7B</xref>). Consistent with their proliferation rates, aspartate levels were lowest in EP SDHB KO cells and were increased by either rotenone treatment or by culturing to LP (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7C</xref>). Also similar to the acute effects of AA5 treatment, EP SDHB KO cells had an increased NAD+/NADH ratio that was diminished upon rotenone treatment; however, the NAD+/NADH ratio was already lowered in LP SDHB KO cells and unaffected by rotenone, suggesting redox adaptations occurred during passaging (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7D</xref>). To determine if these adaptive phenotypes were due to the selective proliferation advantages they provide or simply inherent to passaged SDH-null cells, we separately passaged EP SDHB KO cells in rotenone for 15 passages (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7s1">Figure 7âfigure supplement 1C</xref>).

Mammalian CI activity is dependent on the expression of &gt;50 genes encoding core subunits and assembly factors, so increasing CI activity by traditional gene overexpression is not feasible. Instead, we expressed a doxycycline (DOX) inducible construct of the <italic>Saccharomyces cerevisiae</italic> NDI1, a rotenone-insensitive CI analog that can restore NADH oxidation and ETC activity in mammalian cells when CI is impaired (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib50">Seo et al., 1998</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib64">Wheaton et al., 2014</xref>). DOX treatment of WT UOK269 cells expressing the inducible (iNDI1) construct resulted in a substantial induction of mitochondrial oxygen consumption that was resistant to rotenone treatment, verifying NDI1 expression and confirming that decreased CI activity is a bottleneck for ETC function in UOK269 cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8">Figure 8D</xref>). NDI1 expression decreased the proliferation of WT UOK269 cells but had no effect on the proliferation of their SDHB-restored counterparts (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8">Figure 8E</xref>). Metabolomics measurements also found that NDI1 expression lowered aspartate levels in WT UOK269 cells, but not in the SDHB-restored UOK269 cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8">Figure 8F</xref>). Since DOX can act as a mitochondrial inhibitor at some doses, we also confirmed that DOX had no effect on proliferation rates or aspartate levels in the absence of the iNDI1 construct (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8s1">Figure 8âfigure supplement 1D and E</xref>). Finally, we tested whether the deleterious effects of CI activity restoration on UOK269 cell proliferation were maintained in a physiological metabolic context by generating mouse xenograft tumors. Notably, DOX-mediated NDI expression also impaired the growth of tumors arising from iNDI1 UOK269 cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8">Figure 8G</xref>). Together, these findings highlight that cells adapt to SDH loss by selecting for concordant CI loss, which is required to maximize aspartate production, cell proliferation rate, and tumorigenesis in SDH-null cancer cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8">Figure 8H</xref>).</p></sec></sec><sec id="s3" sec-type="discussion"><title>Discussion</title><p>Mitochondria are established contributors to catabolic cell metabolism through their canonical oxidative TCA cycle and ETC activities. In proliferating cells, the anabolic contributions of these processes in NAD+/NADH homeostasis and TCA cycle-derived aspartate production have recently gained appreciation, defining important amphibolic roles for oxidative mitochondrial metabolism (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Birsoy et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib53">Sullivan et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib57">Titov et al., 2016</xref>). However, the fact that loss-of-function mutations in genes encoding the TCA cycle enzymes SDH and Fumarate Hydratase (FH) can promote tumorigenesis in some contexts challenges the notion that mitochondrial oxidative anabolism is strictly essential for aspartate production. Here, we investigate the metabolic roles of SDH and find that, in cells that employ oxidative TCA cycle function, SDH activity is primarily required for cell proliferation by supporting aspartate production. Interestingly, we found that cells can tolerate SDH loss if they also have concomitant CI impairment, which supports cell proliferation by decreasing mitochondrial NAD+/NADH to enable alternative aspartate synthesis in the cytosol, driven by PC and RCQ. The linked nature of SDH and CI was also revealed by reciprocal experiments where either SDHB was knocked out in wild type cells or restored in cancer cells arising from SDHB mutations. In both cases, functional SDH selects for cells with high CI activity and impaired SDH selects for cells with low CI activity, suggesting two modalities for mitochondrial anabolic metabolism: (1) CI regenerates NAD +to drive oxidative anabolism via the TCA cycle, or (2) CI loss prevents NADH consumption, supporting NADH-driven reductive anabolism in the mitochondria of cells without canonical TCA cycle function. Overall, these findings support a growing understanding that mitochondrial function has critical roles in supporting cell function beyond its classical role in oxidative ATP synthesis, which can be revealed by divergent phenotypic effects of impairments to discrete components of mitochondrial metabolism (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Arnold et al., 2022</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">MartÃ­nez-Reyes et al., 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib40">Mullen et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib48">Ryan et al., 2021</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib58">To et al., 2019</xref>).</p><p>Our results highlight the interconnectedness of cellular metabolism by demonstrating how intercompartmental metabolic variables can collaborate to promote metabolic adaptations and support cell function. The observations that CI inhibition primarily decreases mitochondrial NAD+/NADH and that only mito<italic>LbNOX</italic> blocks the benefits of CI inhibition in SDH-impaired cells localize the site of redox effect to the mitochondria. Interestingly, we find that CI inhibition promotes aspartate synthesis in SDH-deficient cells by driving PC and RCQ activity; however, neither path directly consumes mitochondrial NADH for its function. Therefore, understanding the mechanistic connection between mitochondrial NAD+/NADH and the activation of those pathways is an important goal for future study. Additionally, we note that SDH/CI impaired cells also require a supply of cytosolic electron acceptors to proliferate, indicating that this metabolic state depends on intercompartmental metabolic differences including a reduced mitochondrial compartment and an oxidized cytosolic environment. These results therefore reveal that compartmentally localized redox state changes can functionally alter cell phenotypes, highlighting the need for tools to measure subcellular metabolic states to gain a comprehensive understanding of cell metabolism.</p><p>Metabolic changes are linked with tumorigenesis, which is epitomized by cancers deriving from mutations in TCA cycle genes. We found that cancer cells devoid of SDH activity enact further metabolic changes by suppressing CI, which is critical for optimal tumor growth and drives alternative aspartate synthesis pathways through MPC, PC, RCQ, and GOT1, suggesting that these pathways could be potential targets for SDH-mutant cancers. Interestingly, the phenomenon of CI loss has also been observed in several other kidney neoplasias, including FH-mutant type 2 papillary renal cell carcinomas (pRCC), renal oncocytomas driven by mitochondrial DNA mutations, and VHL-mutant clear cell renal cell carcinomas (ccRCC), which are characterized by suppression of oxidative mitochondrial metabolism (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Courtney et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Crooks et al., 2021</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">Mayr et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib51">Simonnet et al., 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib59">Tomlinson et al., 2002</xref>). Decreases in CI expression and/or heteroplasmic mutations in mitochondrial DNA CI genes have also been reported across diverse cancers, suggesting that activation of reductive mitochondrial anabolism may be a metabolic feature of those cancers and correspond to similar metabolic vulnerabilities (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Gorelick et al., 2021</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Kumari et al., 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib46">Reznik et al., 2017</xref>). On the contrary, CI inhibitors have also been identified as a therapeutic avenue for cancer treatment, which can decrease tumor growth by affecting redox homeostasis and suppressing intratumoral aspartate (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Baccelli et al., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Gui et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">MartÃ­nez-Reyes et al., 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">Molina et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib55">Sullivan et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib64">Wheaton et al., 2014</xref>). Notably, the responses to these mitochondrial inhibitors have been variable across clinical trials and cancer models suggesting that heterogeneity in mitochondrial metabolism may govern the responses to CI inhibitors, and potentially to future inhibitors of reductive mitochondrial anabolism (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Janku et al., 2021</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">Momcilovic et al., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib67">Yap et al., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib68">Yap et al., 2023</xref>).

A 2 Î¼g aliquot from each sample was combined, dried to remove the acetonitrile, concentrated on a C18 ZipTip (Millipore) and analyzed via LC/MS as a âlabel checkâ. The label check was used for two purposes. First, it ensured the TMT labeling efficiency was greater than 95%. Second, sample equalization volumes were determined after summing the total intensity from each sample TMT âchannelâ and calculating the volume of each sample that should be mixed to provide equal amounts from each sample in the final mixture. After labeling efficiency was determined, the reactions were quenched with hydroxylamine to a final concentration of 0.3% (v/v) for 15 min with mixing.

In-line de-salting was accomplished using a reversed-phase trap column (100 Î¼mÃ20 mm) packed with Magic C<sub>18</sub>AQ (5 Î¼m, 200 Ã resin; Michrom Bioresources, Auburn, CA) followed by peptide separations on a reversed-phase column (75 Î¼mÃ270 mm) packed with ReproSil-Pur C<sub>18</sub>AQ (3 Î¼m, 120 Ã resin; Dr. Maisch, Baden-WÃ¼rtemburg, Germany) directly mounted on the electrospray ion source. A 180-min gradient from 4% to 44% B (80% acetonitrile in 0.1% formic acid/water) at a flow rate of 300 nL/min was used for chromatographic separations. A spray voltage of 2300 V was applied to the electrospray tip in-line with a FAIMS pro source using varied compensation voltage â40,â60, â80 while the Orbitrap Eclipse instrument was operated in the data-dependent mode.

Metabolite quantitation was performed using a Q Exactive HF-X Hybrid Quadrupole-Orbitrap Mass Spectrometer equipped with an Ion Max API source and H-ESI II probe, coupled to a Vanquish Flex Binary UHPLC system (Thermo Scientific). Mass calibrations were completed at a minimum of every 5 days in both the positive and negative polarity modes using LTQ Velos ESI Calibration Solution (Pierce). Polar Samples were chromatographically separated by injecting a sample volume of 1 Î¼L into a SeQuant ZIC-pHILIC Polymeric column (2.1x150 mm 5 mM, EMD Millipore). The flow rate was set to 150 mL/min, autosampler temperature set to 10 Â°C, and column temperature set to 30 Â°C. Mobile Phase A consisted of 20 mM ammonium carbonate and 0.1% (v/v) ammonium hydroxide, and Mobile Phase B consisted of 100% acetonitrile. The sample was gradient eluted (%B) from the column as follows: 0â20 min.: linear gradient from 85 % to 20 % B; 20â24 min.: hold at 20% B; 24â24.5 min.: linear gradient from 20 % to 85 % B; 24.5 min.-end: hold at 85% B until equilibrated with ten column volumes.

Quantitation of all metabolites was performed using Tracefinder 4.1 (Thermo Scientific) referencing an in-house metabolite standards library using â¤5 ppm mass error. Metabolite abundances were quantified by comparing ion counts relative to cells reflecting the most unmodified metabolic state for each experiment (WT cells, vehicle treatment, AB cells, as indicated) from cells cultured in DMEM containing an electron acceptor (PYR or AKB, as indicated).

fully understood how cell proliferation occurs in cells that lack SDH. Hart et al. elegantly demonstrate that lack of mitochondrial complex I increases proliferation in cells lacking SDH. The authors have expertly dissected the mechanism behind the rescue and show that inhibition of complex I restores aspartate production by modulating NAD+/NADH. This study thus demonstrates that compartmentalized redox changes control distinct aspartate biosynthetic pathways that promote the proliferation of tumor cells.</p></body></sub-article><sub-article article-type="decision-letter" id="sa1"><front-stub><article-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.78654.sa1</article-id><title-group><article-title>Decision letter</article-title></title-group><contrib-group content-type="section"><contrib contrib-type="editor"><name><surname>Sharpley</surname><given-names>Mark S</given-names></name><role>Reviewing Editor</role><aff><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="ror">https://ror.org/02pammg90</institution-id><institution>Cedars-Sinai Medical Center</institution></institution-wrap><country>United States</country></aff></contrib></contrib-group><contrib-group><contrib contrib-type="reviewer"><name><surname>Christofk</surname><given-names>Heather</given-names></name><role>Reviewer</role><aff><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="ror">https://ror.org/046rm7j60</institution-id><institution>University of California, Los Angeles</institution></institution-wrap><country>United States</country></aff></contrib></contrib-group></front-stub><body><boxed-text id="sa2-box1"><p>Our editorial process produces two outputs: (i) <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://sciety.org/articles/activity/10.1101/2022.03.14.484352">public reviews</ext-link> designed to be posted alongside <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://www.biorxiv.org/content/10.1101/2022.03.14.484352v1">the preprint</ext-link> for the benefit of readers; (ii) feedback on the manuscript for the authors, including requests for revisions, shown below.

Your article has been reviewed by 3 peer reviewers, one of whom is a member of our Board of Reviewing Editors, and the evaluation has been overseen by Utpal Banerjee as the Senior Editor. The following individual involved in review of your submission has agreed to reveal their identity: Heather Christofk (Reviewer #2).</p><p>The reviewers have discussed their reviews with one another, and the Reviewing Editor has drafted this to help you prepare a revised submission.</p><p>The manuscript has been reviewed by three reviewers who were all in agreement that the work has potential. However, all of the reviewers identified a number of issues with the manuscript that will need to be addressed for it to be accepted by <italic>eLife</italic>. The authors will see from the essential revisions and from the individual recommendations that a lot of work is expected and it will not be straightforward for the authors to sufficiently improve the manuscript within a reasonable period of time. However, the reviewers all agree that the authors should be given the opportunity to revise the manuscript if they wish to do so. Yet, given the extensive nature of the requested revisions, the reviewers ask that the authors carefully consider whether trying to revise the manuscript for publication in <italic>eLife</italic> is the best option for them and it might be that submission to another journal is preferable.</p><p>Essential revisions:</p><p>1) The reviewers feel that the data linking Asp to rescue of proliferation are mostly correlative. Much more evidence is needed to conclude that the small changes in aspartate abundance are sufficient to restore proliferation and the presented correlations between aspartate levels and proliferation are not sufficient evidence that aspartate biosynthesis is the primary mode of supporting cell proliferation in SDH-deficient cells.</p><p>Similarly, comparison of Asp rescue between different conditions is also challenging and the authors are inconsistent in their interpretation of meaningful changes in aspartate. For example, the recovery of Asp caused by &quot;AA5 + pyruvate&quot; (Figure 1D) appears to be greater than that caused by &quot;AA5 and rotenone&quot; (Figure 2B), yet the recovery of proliferation by &quot;AA5 + pyruvate&quot; is less. As another example, Asp levels in &quot;AA5+mitoLbNOX&quot; (Figure 3E) appear greater than Asp levels in &quot;AA5+ rotenone&quot; (Figure 2B). However, only &quot;AA5 + rotenone&quot; rescues proliferation. In other words, the relationship between Asp recovery and proliferation is not clear.</p><p>As one further example, in Figure 1E, the authors investigated the M4 aspartate isotopomer derived from U-13C-glutamine and conclude that pyruvate is insufficient to restore progression through the TCA cycle in AA5 treated cells because it resulted in only a 2.8X increase; yet in Figure 2B the authors observed a 2.3X increase in aspartate levels in cells treated with AA5 + rotenone, which leads the authors to conclude that CI and SDH co-inhibition partially restored aspartate levels.</p><p>Can the authors more clearly describe how they are determining their thresholds and when (and how much) an increase in Asp is considered noteworthy?</p><p>As a result of this uncertainty in the extent of Asp recovery, the proposed rescue of Asp as a factor in facilitating proliferation in SDH and CI inhibition is not convincing. Right now, a key question can't be assessed by the reader: how much Asp is needed for proliferation? The quantitative relationship between Asp levels and proliferation should be made clearer.</p><p>2) A full mechanistic model should be clearly presented by the authors and the manuscript would be strengthened if the authors would take the next steps and provide experimental support for potential mechanisms. For example, currently, it is not clear which pathways of Asp synthesis are controlled by mitochondrial NADH (e.g. is reductive carboxylation or PC activity at play here). Moreover, it is not clear in this system, whether Asp regulates proliferation via &quot;reverse&quot; operation of GOT to support biosynthesis or forward &quot;operation&quot; to generate NAD+ for aerobic glycolysis.</p><p>More generally, there is a lack of a coherent and consistent explanation for the phenotype and the authors would help the reader if they would present a clear model throughout the manuscript.</p><p>3) The data relating NAD+/NADH to the rescue of Asp and proliferation are hard to interpret. On a practical level, the data presentation is not clear and would be easier to interpret if the ion counts for NAD+ and NADH were presented rather than relative ratios.</p><p>There are also several conceptual issues with the NAD+/NADH mechanism that need to be cleared up. For example, the data shows that the NAD+/NADH pools are compartmentalized, but their connection to proliferation and aspartate synthesis is not clear from the presented data. Providing additional data would help interpret the role of NAD/NADH in the LbNOX experiments. Are cyto- and mito-LbNox causing the same level of reversal of the NAD+/NADH balance? Is the LbNOX construct just less functional when in the mitochondrial versus the cytosolic form?</p><p>Furthermore, the authors should address the variable correlation between the NAD+/NADH ratio and proliferation. For example, in Figure 3G, H, the change in proliferation seems to be relatively minor compared to other proliferation changes presented in this work.</p><p>To reiterate the comment above, clarifying and quantifying the mechanistic links between mitochondrial NAD+/NADH and Asp and proliferation is critical if this manuscript is to be published by <italic>eLife</italic>.</p><p>4) The data presentation needs to be clearer and to be more consistent. For example, the Asp recovery experiments are sometimes presented using log scales which make very small changes in Asp levels appear much more substantial than they are; linear scales may be more appropriate and easier to interpret. The metabolite measurement data would also be clearer if presented as normalized ion counts rather than relative amounts; the ion counts should at the very least be provided somewhere in the manuscript.</p><p>5) In the current version of the manuscript, key data are not always consistent between panels. For example, the recovery of proliferation in SDH inhibited cells by rotenone appears somewhat inconsistent between experiments (e.g. Figure 2A and Figure S3B). As another example, in Figure 1, SDHB expression in UOK269 cells led to a proliferation rate that was nearly 5X higher than the control cells. Yet in Figure 2l, the proliferation rate of UOK269 cells expressing SDHB is the same as those not expressing SDHB. Further still, in 1F, addition of AA5 without PYR leads to minimal change in the NAD+/NADH ratio, while in 3A, sole addition of AA5 roughly doubles the NAD+/NADH ratio. The lack of consistency between panels is a recurrent problem throughout the manuscript and it is critical that the authors address these inconsistencies.</p><p>6) As detailed in the individual responses, several panels lack important controls and the appropriate statistical comparisons are not always included.</p><p>7) Some of the data included in the manuscript does not add support to the model. For example, data regarding the combinatorial treatment of cells with AA5+AZD7545 (Figures 3G-H) shows only slight changes in proliferation and aspartate levels. This adds little to the argument that mitochondria-specific alterations in NAD+/NADH and aspartate biosynthesis are responsible for proliferation in the context of SDH inhibition.</p><p>8) Could the authors address/discuss the physiological relevance of their findings. Do CI subunits exhibit decreased expression in SDH-deficient tumors in patients? Is this a phenomenon of cell culture or is this also observed in vivo? Could more physiological oxygen tension (or even hypoxia) affect SDH-deficient cell proliferation?</p><p><italic>Reviewer #1 (Recommendations for the authors):</italic></p><p>1. The Asp recovery experiments are hard to interpret.</p><p>The panels showing Asp levels (e.g. in Figure 1D, 2B, 1G, 3E, 1H) would be easier for the reader to interpret if they were shown with a linear scale on the y-axis. On a linear scale the recovery of Asp by rotenone treatment in SDH inhibited cells (Figure 2B) would look quite minor compared to the loss of Asp that is caused by SDH inhibition. The authors also use different non-linear scales to show Asp levels in different panels of the same figure (e.g. Figure 2G and J), which is especially confusing.</p><p>Comparison of Asp rescue between different conditions is also challenging. For example, the recovery of Asp caused by &quot;AA5 + pyruvate&quot; (Figure 1D) appears to be greater than that caused by &quot;AA5 and rotenone&quot; (Figure 2B), yet the recovery of proliferation by &quot;AA5 + pyruvate&quot; is less. As another example, Asp levels in &quot;AA5+mitoLbNOX&quot; (Figure 3E) appear greater than Asp levels in &quot;AA5+ rotenone&quot; (Figure 2B). However, only &quot;AA5 + rotenone&quot; rescues proliferation. In other words, the relationship between Asp recovery and proliferation is not clear.</p><p>Part of the problem is that the authors use relative ion counts as well as non-linear scales. They also show the data for closely related conditions in different figures and panels. The best way to resolve the problem would be to present the data as absolute values rather than relative ion counts (e.g. fmol of Asp per cell). If this is not available, the authors should present the (normalized) ion counts (i.e. not the relative ion counts) on a linear scale, with error bars representing the variance of the ion counts. The authors do this in Figure 4B and it is much clearer.</p><p>Do the authors have the data from a control sample (143B wild-type cells) that could be included in Figure 4B, so that the reader could see how the rescue of Asp by SDHB KO compares to wild-type levels? Incidentally, Figure 4A would also be easier to interpret if the proliferation rate of wild-type 143B cells were also included.</p><p>More generally, if the experiments were performed at the same time, it would be helpful if the data for all the conditions were to be collated in a Sup. Table so that the recovery of Asp between different conditions can easily be compared.</p><p>As a result of this uncertainty in the extent of Asp recovery, the proposed rescue of Asp as a factor in facilitating proliferation in SDH and CI inhibition is not convincing. Right now, a key question can't be assessed by the reader: how much Asp is needed for proliferation? The quantitative relationship between Asp levels and proliferation should be made clearer.</p><p>2. The data relating NAD+/NADH to the rescue of Asp and proliferation is not entirely convincing and is quite hard to interpret (Figure 1F, G).</p><p>i) It is not quite clear what is being measured in Figure 1F. The NAD+/NADH ratio reported in the Figure (i.e. ratio is approx. &quot;1&quot; for controls) is far lower than values that are reported in the literature for this cell line using a different approach (e.g. in the corresponding authors previous work with this cell line) or using carefully validated methods to extract NAD from other cell lines (e.g. by the Rabinowitz group, 2018, Antioxid Redox Signal.). It may be too much to ask the authors to redo the experiments using standards (to provide absolute amounts or concentrations), but it would easier to interpret claims about the role of redox state in these processes easier if the ratio reported here more closely reflects the intracellular NAD+/NADH ratio.</p><p>Perhaps the authors are reporting a relative ratio (a ratio of ratios?) that is normalized to the control group? If so, the figure legend isn't clear. Furthermore, having a ratio of ratios is very hard to interpret and can't be compared to previous studies or between experiments in this study. Could the authors please report either the NAD+/NADH ratio that they have measured for each group (on a linear scale), or (better) report the measured values for NAD+ and NADH (e.g. fmol per cell).</p><p>ii) Could the authors comment on the lack of an increase in the NAD+/NAD ratio in control cells when they are treated with pyruvate. Isn't this unexpected and inconsistent with previous studies? Several previous studies in very similar systems have all shown an increase in the NAD+/NADH following pyruvate treatment (e.g. Gui et al. 2016 Cell Metabolism), confirming many older studies.</p><p>iii) The authors use global NAD+/NADH measurements to infer compartment specific changes. The follow-up experiments using LbNOX are quite an indirect way to check whether this is the case. FLIM would provide some indication if the cytoplasmic and mitochondria pools of NAD(P)H are acting as proposed by the authors.</p><p>3. A full mechanistic model is not clearly presented by the authors.</p><p>The scheme in Figure 1G presumably doesn't reflect the author's full model, and it would be informative for the authors to present their proposed mechanism somewhere in the manuscript. Right now, it is not clear (for example) how the increase of mitochondrial NADH by dual inhibition of SDH and CI leads to an increase in Asp, or how the rescued Asp levels restore proliferation in this system.</p><p>The authors address how mitochondrial NADH increase may increase Asp in the Discussion. However, the manuscript would be strengthened if these questions were addressed experimentally. For example, it is straightforward to test whether reductive carboxylation of glutamine or anaplerosis by pyruvate carboxylase is responsible for the rescue of Asp when both SDH and CI are inhibited.</p><p>Furthermore, the link between Asp levels and proliferation has been extensively described in other conditions, but not in this specific condition. Given that the role and &quot;direction&quot; of Asp metabolism varies markedly between different conditions (e.g., Birsoy et al. 2015 vs Gaude et al. 2018) the authors should test which model is operating here. E.g. are MDH1 and GOT1 operating in reverse to generate Asp that is used for biosynthetic reactions, or are GOT1 and MDH1 is operating in the forward direction to consume Asp in order to generate NAD+ for aerobic glycolysis (perhaps more plausible here?).</p><p>As a whole the manuscript covers a lot of previously covered ground (e.g. loss of SDH causes loss of CI in tumors (e.g. Fendt group)), loss of SDH and CI creates a requirement for Asp synthesis (Gottlieb group). A clear mechanism of how mitochondrial NADH rescues Asp levels and proliferation would contribute much to its novelty.</p><p>4. Key data are not always consistent between panels</p><p>For example, the recovery of proliferation in SDH inhibited cells by rotenone appears somewhat inconsistent between experiments (e.g. Figure 2A and Figure S3B). Some variability is to be expected, but, in this version of the manuscript, the experimental variability isn't reflected in the error bars.</p><p>5. Are the 143B cells used in these experiments capable of pyrimidine salvage?</p><p>It would be useful to know whether the 143B line that is used for most of the experiments is thymidine kinase negative (e.g, the 143B cells from ATCC are TK-). If so, this should be clearly stated in the methods, as lack of thymidine salvage will impact how these results are interpreted.</p><p>6. The rescue by AZD7545 does not add support to the model</p><p>The rescue of proliferation and especially Asp levels by AZD7545 is so small that if is hard to assess its importance. Is a difference between ~27% and ~31% of wild-type Asp levels really meaningful? When placed on a linear scale it would be hard to discern a difference between Asp levels in these groups.</p><p><italic>Reviewer #2 (Recommendations for the authors):</italic></p><p>1. While quite interesting, the physiological relevance of SDH and ETC complex I inhibition is unclear. Do CI subunits exhibit decreased expression in SDH-deficient tumors in patients? Is this a phenomenon of cell culture or is this also observed in vivo? Could more physiological oxygen tension (or even hypoxia) affect SDH-deficient cell proliferation?</p><p>2. The data regarding the importance of aspartate biosynthesis in the context of SDH inhibition are mostly correlative and lack important controls.</p><p>a. Figure 1C â How was the dose selected for Asp treatment in the SLC1A3-expressing cells? While the tracing data confirms the increased uptake of Asp relative to non-SLC1A3 expressing cells (S1B-C), the authors do not report Asp levels or indicate how the dosage was selected.</p><p>b. Figures 1I and S1K â SDHB expression in UOK269 cells permitted glutamine-dependent aspartate biosynthesis and increased cell proliferation, yet the authors did not report how SDHB expression affected aspartate levels.</p><p>c. The authors are inconsistent in their interpretation of meaningful changes in aspartate. For example, regarding Figure 1E, the authors investigated the M4 aspartate isotopomer derived from U-13C-glutamine and conclude that pyruvate is insufficient to restore progression through the TCA cycle in AA5 treated cells because it resulted in only a 2.8X increase; yet in Figure 2B the authors observed a 2.3X increase in aspartate levels in cells treated with AA5 + rotenone, which leads the authors to conclude that CI and SDH co-inhibition partially restored aspartate levels.</p><p>d. Is the increase in proliferation upon SDH and CI inhibition dependent on GOT?</p><p>3. Overstatements of results reduce clarity of the findings. For example:</p><p>a. The authors argument that &quot;SDH inhibition blocks proliferation, which is restored by aspartate but not electron acceptors&quot; (Figure 1 title) seems to be an overstatement. Though aspartate seems to increase cell proliferation to a greater degree than electron acceptors, data presented in 1A and 1C indicate that pyruvate, AKB, and LbNOX are all sufficient to increase cell proliferation.</p><p>b. The presented correlations between aspartate levels and proliferation are not sufficient evidence that aspartate biosynthesis is the primary mode of supporting cell proliferation in SDH-deficient cells. For example, in Supp. Figure 2B-C aspartate levels are not rescued to the same extent as proliferation across the panel of cell lines.</p><p>c. Data regarding the combinatorial treatment of cells with AA5+AZD7545 (Figures 3G-H) shows only slight changes to proliferation and aspartate levels. This adds little to the argument that mitochondria-specific alterations in NAD+/NADH and aspartate biosynthesis are responsible for proliferation in the context of SDH inhibition.</p><p>4. Statistical analysis was frequently missing or improperly conducted. For example, regarding panel 1A the authors noted that AA5 and rotenone treatment decreased cell proliferation and that co-treatment with pyruvate, AKB, LbNox, or Asp restored proliferation. Statistical comparisons were made between AA5 and rotenone for all groups; however, based on the text, the statistical analysis should be restricted to comparisons between groups for each AA5 and rotenone.</p><p>5. The data presentation throughout the manuscript is confusing. For example, in some panels the y-axis is log-scale while in complimentary panels the y-axis is linear, and for some graphs the y-axis does not start at 0.</p><p>6. In Figure 1, SDHB expression in UOK269 cells led to a proliferation rate that was nearly 5X higher than the control cells. Yet in Figure 2l, the proliferation rate of UOK269 cells expressing SDHB is the same as those not expressing SDHB. Why are the proliferation rates different?</p><p><italic>Reviewer #3 (Recommendations for the authors):</italic></p><p>During our reading of the manuscript, we felt the model the authors proposed within this work was not consistent or clear throughout the text. We feel that some attention could be made to try to emphasize and clarify this model throughout and would greatly assist other readers of the work.

We agree that, as previously written, the relationship between the relative levels of aspartate and the corresponding expectation for proliferation effects was not clearly described, leading to confusion about what fold change thresholds are considered meaningful. Compounding this issue was some variability in the LCMS methods used in the early stages of this project that occasionally distorted relative levels, leading to some inconsistencies in the actual numbers generated across experiments (e.g. when samples were too concentrated, aspartate detection could fall outside the linear range for our mass spectrometer, affecting relative levels). While the qualitative conclusions of the manuscript were not affected by those issues, we agree that describing a consistent quantitative relationship between aspartate levels and proliferation would improve the manuscript. To address these important issues, we have (1) improved our LCMS protocols and repeated many experiments and (2) conducted experiments to directly describe the quantitative relationship between ASP levels and proliferation during mitochondrial inhibition.</p><p>1) Standardizing aspartate quantification:</p><p>To ensure that we are accurately measuring changes in aspartate levels, we first standardized our protocol to ensure uniform cell material inputs by normalizing metabolite extract loading to total cell volume. Cell volumes were measured from parallel wells at the time of extraction using a Coulter Counter, which we have found to be a preferred method for calculating the cell volume from adherent cells (DOI:Â 10.21769/BioProtoc.4216). For each condition, the volume of metabolite extract containing 1 uL of total cell volume was calculated, aliquoted into new tubes, dried, and resuspended in 150 uL of solvent prior to running. Next, we incorporated an isotopically labeled amino acid mix containing aspartate at 1 Î¼m into the resuspension solvent to serve as an internal standard. Finally, we also measured the linearity of aspartate detection across a standard curve of isotopically labeled amino acid mix. Importantly, we found that aspartate ion counts had a linear relationship with the loaded concentration of standard between 1 x 10<sup>6</sup> and 5 x 10<sup>9</sup> ions, and possibly higher (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="sa2fig1">Author response image 1A</xref>). Using the standardized protocol described here, we also found that the ion counts of aspartate measured from cells cultured in representative conditions from this study was between 1 x 10<sup>7</sup> and 1 x10<sup>9</sup> ions, well within the linear range for linear aspartate quantification. Collectively these data support the conclusion that this method allows for accurate measurements of relative aspartate levels across conditions (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="sa2fig1">Author response image 1B</xref>). The methods section was edited to describe these methodological differences (see: âliquid chromatography-mass spectrometryâ section).</p><fig id="sa2fig1" position="float"><label>Author response image 1.</label><caption><title>Quantitative analysis of aspartate detection by LCMS.</title><p>(A) Detection of isotopically labeled aspartate by LCMS across a standard curve of aspartate levels.

Including changing to a linear Y axis (with break) instead of a log axis. The linear Y axis also âfold changeâ values unnecessary and so were removed, since they were an additional source of confusion.</p><p>2) Quantifying the relationship between aspartate levels and proliferation:</p><p>A critical conclusion from this study is that aspartate levels correlate with, and determine, the proliferation rate across conditions of SDH inhibition. This conclusion is reached by two fundamental observations: (1) The proliferation defects after SDH inhibition are ameliorated by aspartate restoration (Revised Manuscript Figures 1A, 1G, 2F, 4C, 4H, 5D, 6D, 6H, 7B, and Figure 1âfigure supplement 1D, 1G, Figure 2âfigure supplement 2H, 2K, and Figure 7âfigure supplement 1D). (2) The proliferation rate upon SDH inhibition (and related cotreatments) directly correlates with aspartate levels. However, as noted by the reviewers, the relative levels of aspartate do not necessarily correlate linearly with proliferation levels, since a small increase in aspartate can have a large effect on proliferation when cells are proliferating slowly, leading to confusion about what is a meaningful change. To address the fundamental relationship between aspartate levels and proliferation, we generated a standard curve comparing the levels of aspartate and the corresponding proliferation rate in conditions well characterized to cause aspartate limitation â treatment with an ETC complex I inhibitor (PMIDs: 27746050, 26232225, 29941931, 26232224, 29941933, 36411320, 29892070). Indeed, when cultured in DMEM without pyruvate across eight doses of rotenone (0, 0.1, 1.25, 3.125, 6.25, 12.5, 25, 50 nM) cells showed a dose dependent decrease in cell proliferation that correlated with a dose dependent decrease in aspartate levels (Revised Manuscript Figures 1C, Figure 1âfigure supplement 1K-L see below). Interestingly, the relationship between aspartate levels and proliferation rate followed a hyperbolic curve, where relatively small increases in aspartate levels cause a large change in proliferation rate when aspartate is very low, and only a minor change in proliferation rate when aspartate is near untreated levels. This curve is consistent with a model where cells have sufficient aspartate when untreated and decreasing aspartate does not immediately cause robust cell proliferation defects until it becomes limiting for a downstream metabolic process (or processes). Our data indicate that, relative to the aspartate levels present in untreated 143B cells (grown in DMEM with 1 mM pyruvate), aspartate only becomes a significant limitation for cell proliferation once depleted to around 0.4, and is unable to support proliferation around 0.05, with a strong correlation between proliferation and aspartate levels between 0.05-0.4. Culturing cells treated with high dose rotenone (50 nM) in media containing the electron acceptor pyruvate restored both aspartate levels and proliferation rate to values consistent with the measured proliferation rate to aspartate levels curve. Finally, we also included measurements of proliferation rate and aspartate levels upon AA5 treatment, with or without pyruvate in the media, and found that they too matched the values observed in rotenone treated cells. Together, these data provide detailed quantitative information about the relationship between aspartate levels and cell proliferation in the context of complex I and SDH inhibition, providing considerable support for our claim that small changes in aspartate levels can impact cell proliferation rate in SDH impaired cells and contextualizing aspartate level changes throughout the study</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>2) A full mechanistic model should be clearly presented by the authors and the manuscript would be strengthened if the authors would take the next steps and provide experimental support for potential mechanisms. For example, currently, it is not clear which pathways of Asp synthesis are controlled by mitochondrial NADH (e.g. is reductive carboxylation or PC activity at play here). Moreover, it is not clear in this system, whether Asp regulates proliferation via &quot;reverse&quot; operation of GOT to support biosynthesis or forward &quot;operation&quot; to generate NAD+ for aerobic glycolysis.</p><p>More generally, there is a lack of a coherent and consistent explanation for the phenotype and the authors would help the reader if they would present a clear model throughout the manuscript.</p></disp-quote><p>We concur with the reviewersâ suggestion that identifying the metabolic enzymes and pathways required for aspartate synthesis is a reasonable and important next step for understanding of this metabolic phenotype and for generating a clear mechanistic model. To address these goals we (1) Conducted stable isotope resolved metabolomics from U-<sup>13</sup>C glucose and U-<sup>13</sup>C glutamine to ascertain the source of aspartate in each condition; (2) Used genetic knockouts and metabolic inhibitors to identify key pathway components of aspartate synthesis in SDH impaired cells; (3) Generated several model figures to clarify our metabolic model(s) of our findings. These experiments generated a significant amount of new data, necessitating the addition of three new figures, each of which has a linked supplemental figure (Revised Manuscript Figures 4, 5, and 6 and Revised Manuscript Supplemental Figures 4, 5, and 6), as well as seven additional model panels.</p><p>1) Stable isotope resolved metabolomics.</p><p>Three primary paths of aspartate synthesis have been described in mammalian cells â the oxidative TCA cycle (primarily deriving from glutamine), reductive carboxylation of Î±-ketoglutarate (primarily deriving from glutamine, âRCQâ), and pyruvate carboxylation (primarily deriving from glucose, âPCâ). Since the oxidative TCA cycle is blocked in SDH impaired cells, it raises the question of which metabolic source contributes to increased aspartate levels when complex I is co-inhibited. We first conducted isotope tracing from wild type (WT) or SDHB KO cells cultured in U-<sup>13</sup>C glutamine for 6 hours, with or without rotenone treatment (Revised Manuscript Figure 4A and B). As expected, glutamine was the predominant carbon source for aspartate in wild type cells, and rotenone predictably decreased aspartate levels and processive TCA cycling, based on M+2 label. Additionally, rotenone treatment increased aspartate levels in SDHB KO cells, as expected, with the only major aspartate isotopotologue species from glutamine being M+3, consistent with being derived from RCQ. While the abundance of M+3 aspartate was increased upon rotenone co-treatment in SDHB KO cells, the total amount of labeled carbon from glutamine remained a relatively small contributor to total aspartate levels in both cases. These data confirm that oxidative TCA cycling is impaired in SDHB KO cells and suggest that RCQ is a modest contributor to increased aspartate upon complex I inhibition.</p><p>We also conducted isotope tracing in identical conditions using U-<sup>13</sup>C glucose. Since unlabeled pyruvate in the media could contaminate the pyruvate labeling from U-<sup>13</sup>C glucose. we cultured cells in media containing 1 mM AKB, which had similar effects on proliferation as 1 mM PYR (Figure 1A). We also confirmed that rotenone co-treatment still restored cell proliferation and aspartate levels to cells cultured in AKB media instead of PYR media (Revised Manuscript Figure 4âfigure supplement 1A and B, below). Consistent with the aforementioned glutamine labeling results, WT cells had minimal labeling from glucose and the small contribution oxidative acetyl-CoA production and processive TCA cycling (M+2) that was diminished by rotenone cotreatment (Revised Manuscript Figure 4E and F, above). However, also consistent with glutamine labeling results, glucose was a dominant contributor to aspartate carbon in SDHB KO cells, with the increase in aspartate levels upon rotenone treatment primarily having M+3 label from U-<sup>13</sup>C glucose. These data suggest that PC is a major contributor to aspartate levels in 143B SDHB KO cells, consistent with results from prior work (Cardaci et al., 2015), and that complex I inhibition can enhance this aspartate synthesis route in SDH impaired cells.</p><p>To corroborate these findings in the patient-derived SDHB mutant UOK269 cells without (WT UOK269) or with SDHB re-expression (SDHB UOK269), we also added U-<sup>13</sup>C glucose tracing to the U-<sup>13</sup>C glutamine isotope tracing conducted in the prior version of the manuscript. As in 143B cells, we found that SDH loss was associated with an increased contribution of glucose to aspartate by PC (M+3) and a switch of glutamine contribution to aspartate from the oxidative TCA cycle (M+4) to RCQ (M+3) (Revised Manuscript Figure 8B and C).</p><p>1) Genetic knockouts and metabolic inhibitors</p><p>a. Dependence on RCQ and PC</p><p>As suggested by the reviewers, we investigated which components of alternative aspartate synthesis pathways were required for CI inhibition to drive aspartate synthesis in SDH impaired cells â evaluating contributions from RCQ, PC, GOT enzymes, and related metabolic enzymes. We first evaluated the relative contributions of RCQ and PC to cell proliferation and aspartate levels in SDH impaired cells, with and without CI co-inhibition. To test the dependence of RCQ we leveraged BMS-303141 (BMS) an inhibitor of ACLY, a shared reaction for the RCQ pathway to aspartate regardless of whether RCQ occurs in the mitochondria by IDH2 or the cytosol by IDH1 (See Revised Manuscript Figure 4âfigure supplement 1A, below, for metabolic model). We found that BMS treatment caused minor cell proliferation defects and lowered aspartate levels in SDH/CI dual-inhibited cells, and that this minor proliferation defect could be remedied by aspartate co-treatment (Revised Manuscript Figure 4C and D, above). Notably, these effects also track with the minor contributions of RCQ to aspartate synthesis, measured by isotope tracing. We next evaluated the dependence on PC, using CRISPR/cas9 to generate isogenic knockout clones for PC, comparing to paired âAddbackâ (AB) clones Revised Manuscript Figure 4G, above. We prefer to compare KO to AB cell lines for each gene knock out rather than to parental WT cells, as it better controls for any unrelated phenotypic changes that can result from the process of single cell cloning. As expected, PC KO sensitized cells to the proliferative and aspartate depleting effects of AA5 treatment and somewhat decreased the corresponding proliferative benefits of rotenone co-treatment (Revised Manuscript Figure 4H and I, above). To test whether residual or compensatory RCQ activity was contributing to the enduring aspartate and proliferation rescue in PC KO cells, we also co-treated with BMS and ASP. Importantly, the combination of PC KO and BMS treatment abolished the proliferation of SDH/CI impaired cells, which could be restored by aspartate co-treatment, indicating that the loss of those pathways prevents cell proliferation in SDH/CI impaired cells by decreasing aspartate availability. Correspondingly, while not quite statistically significant, BMS treatment mitigated the increase of aspartate upon rotenone co-treatment in PC KO cells, with the partial effect in PC AB cells mirroring that of wild type cells in Figure 4D. Collectively, these experiments reveal that RCQ and PC are essential contributors to the induction of aspartate synthesis in SDH impaired cells upon CI co-inhibition (Revised Manuscript Figure 4J, above).</p><p>b. Dependence on mitochondrial pyruvate import</p><p>While not explicitly requested by the reviewers, we sought to dive deeper to mechanistically understand how compartmentalized redox changes could drive alternative aspartate synthesis via RCQ and PC. While PC is conventionally reported to be active in the mitochondria, recent reports have concluded that it may have some cytoplasmic activity (PMID: 34547241) and so we investigated whether mitochondrial pyruvate entry was required for in the induction of aspartate and proliferation upon CI inhibition in SDH impaired cells. To do so, we generated knockout and AB cells for the essential mitochondrial pyruvate carrier subunit, MPC1. MPC1 KO and AB were verified by western blot (Revised Manuscript Figure 5A). We then tested the effects of AA5 with or without rotenone and found that MPC1 KO cells had severe proliferation defects upon AA5 treatment that were not rescued by rotenone co-treatment (Revised Manuscript Figure 5B). Importantly aspartate levels corroborated this result since rotenone co-treatment in AA5 treated MPC1 KO cells had minimal ability to increase aspartate levels (Revised Manuscript Figure 5C). Once again, this inability to increase aspartate upon rotenone treatment was functionally limiting in AA5 and AA5/rotenone treated MPC1 KO cells since aspartate treatment could still restore their cell proliferation (Revised Manuscript Figure 5D). Notably, the loss of mitochondrial pyruvate uptake not only decreases pyruvate for potential PC reactions, but also pyruvate for transamination by GPT2, which generates alanine from pyruvate while converting glutamate to AKG â a necessary substrate for RCQ driven aspartate synthesis. In support of this hypothesis, MPC1 KO cells were associated with depletion of both alanine and AKG in both vehicle and AA5 treated conditions (Revised Manuscript Figures 5E and Figure 5âfigure supplement 1B). Notably, AKG levels (but not alanine levels) were further depleted in MPC1 KO cells when co-treated with rotenone, suggesting that residual GDH activity provides some AKG production in MPC1KO cells, which is blocked upon NAD+ depletion by rotenone treatment. Together, these data identify a novel metabolic dependency of SDH deficient cancer cells on MPC that supports both pathways of alternative aspartate synthesis.</p><p>c. Dependence on compartmentalized GOT enzymes</p><p>Aspartate is generated from oxaloacetate, using glutamate as a nitrogen donor, through either the cytosolic transaminase GOT1 or the mitochondrial transaminase GOT2. Recent studies have found that GOT2 generates aspartate during canonical oxidative TCA cycle metabolism and in PDAC cells cultured in hypoxia (PMID: 35726024), whereas GOT1 can generate aspartate during other forms of mitochondrial dysfunction (PMID: 26232224). We again turned to CRISPR/Cas9 to generate knockout clones for GOT1 or GOT2 and to compare the effects of AA5 with or without rotenone co-treatment, comparing KO cell lines to their restored counterparts (AB). We first tested the effects of GOT2 KO our phenotypes. GOT2 KO and AB were confirmed by western blot and functionally, since GOT2 KO cells cannot grow without pyruvate, as has been recently published (Revised Manuscript Figures 6A and Figure 6âfigure supplement 1A) (PMID: 35815941). While GOT2 loss caused an increase in sensitivity to AA5, it had essentially no effect on the proliferation restoration from rotenone co-treatment when compared AB cell lines (Revised Manuscript Figure 6B). Measurement of aspartate levels corroborated these results, where aspartate levels were restored by rotenone in both GOT2 KO and AB cell lines (Revised Manuscript Figure 6C). Finally, the proliferative defects from AA5 treatment in GOT2 KO cells was found to result from aspartate deficiency, as treatment with aspartate could restore proliferation to AA5 treated cells to a similar degree as rotenone co-treatment (Revised Manuscript Figure 6D). We then generated KO and AB cell lines for GOT1, which were confirmed by western blot, and then conducted similar experiments (Revised Manuscript Figure 6E). Notably, GOT1 KO cells did not have notable sensitivity to AA5 treatment, consistent with their dependency on GOT2 in this condition, but the proliferation benefit from rotenone co-treatment was abolished in the absence of GOT1 (Revised Manuscript Figure 6F). Measuring aspartate levels similarly showed that the increase in aspartate levels upon rotenone co-treatment was absent in AA5 treated cells without GOT1, commensurate with their proliferation phenotype (Revised Manuscript Figure 6G). Interestingly, we noted that this defect in aspartate production was downstream of the increased anaplerosis following CI inhibition in SDH impaired cells, as malate levels still increase upon CI/SDH co-inhibition in GOT1 KO cells (Revised Manuscript Figure 6âfigure supplement 1B). Nonetheless, the impaired ability to synthesize aspartate was functionally limiting for proliferation since aspartate treatment could still restore the proliferation to AA5/rotenone treated GOT1 KO cells (Revised Manuscript Figure 6H). Finally, we corroborated the finding that cells dependent on GOT1 for aspartate synthesis also depend on MDH1 as well, presumably to generate cytosolic OAA for GOT1 dependent aspartate synthesis (Revised Manuscript Figure 6âfigure supplement 1D-F and Figure 6I).</p><p>Collectively, the above experiments indicate that the increased aspartate levels and proliferation upon complex I inhibition in SDH impaired cells arise primarily from mitochondrial redox changes driving pyruvate carboxylation and, to a lesser degree, reductive carboxylation of glutamine, both of which depend on mitochondrial pyruvate, to generate cytosolic OAA to ultimately being converted to aspartate in the cytosol via GOT1.</p><p>1) Metabolic models</p><p>As recommended by the reviewers, we have incorporated our data into seven additional model figure panels to help communicate our understanding of the metabolic pathways and phenotypes relevant to SDH deficient cells, see Revised Manuscript Figures 2H, 3G, Figure 4âfigure supplement 1A, Figure 5âfigure supplement 1A, Figure 6âfigure supplement 1C, 7J, and 8H, (new models for Main Figures 4, 5, and 6 are shown above).</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>3) The data relating NAD+/NADH to the rescue of Asp and proliferation are hard to interpret. On a practical level, the data presentation is not clear and would be easier to interpret if the ion counts for NAD+ and NADH were presented rather than relative ratios.</p><p>There are also several conceptual issues with the NAD+/NADH mechanism that need to be cleared up. For example, the data shows that the NAD+/NADH pools are compartmentalized, but their connection to proliferation and aspartate synthesis is not clear from the presented data. Providing additional data would help interpret the role of NAD/NADH in the LbNOX experiments. Are cyto- and mito-LbNox causing the same level of reversal of the NAD+/NADH balance? Is the LbNOX construct just less functional when in the mitochondrial versus the cytosolic form?</p><p>Furthermore, the authors should address the variable correlation between the NAD+/NADH ratio and proliferation. For example, in Figure 3G, H, the change in proliferation seems to be relatively minor compared to other proliferation changes presented in this work.</p><p>To reiterate the comment above, clarifying and quantifying the mechanistic links between mitochondrial NAD+/NADH and Asp and proliferation is critical if this manuscript is to be published by eLife.</p></disp-quote><p>We are glad to have the opportunity to further clarify the connection between (compartmentalized) NAD+/NADH, aspartate levels, and cell proliferation. The comments raise two general issues, each of which will be addressed in turn: (1) Ion counts vs relative ratios, (2) Evidence for compartmentalized redox changes in the comments about Original Submission Figures3G and H will be incorporated into the discussion about those panels below.</p><p>1) NAD+/NADH ion counts, ratios, and relative ratios.</p><p>NAD+/NADH is a compound measurement of synthesis pathways of NAD(H) and the redox reactions that govern the NAD+/NADH ratio, which in turn affects other reactions that use those coenzymes. We have previously found that, in the context of mitochondrial inhibition, treatments that alter NAD+ and NADH pool sizes can alter NAD+/NADH ratios and dependent metabolic reactions, but that the ratio change from this approach is temporary as the ratio adjusts to the larger total pool size and that the resulting ratio ultimately governs the phenotypic effects on proliferation (PMID: 27746050). Thus, we believe that displaying the NAD+/NADH ratio is still the most relevant output for understanding changes in redox status and metabolism, rather than NAD+ or NADH ion counts individually. Nonetheless, in the interest of full transparency we have added all ion counts for NAD+ and NADH to Supplementary File 1 for easy reference.</p><p>We do however sympathize with the issue reviewers raise regarding to ârelative ratios,â where we normalized the ratio of ion counts for NAD+ and NADH ratio from each sample to that of the vehicle treated cells. The reason we used this approach in the prior version is that, because standards for isotopically labeled NAD+ and NADH are not widely available, LCMS ion counts for NAD+ and NADH do not incorporate differences in matrix effects or ionization efficiencies for each analyte (and so are not comparable from an absolute quantitation perspective) and thus do not constitute a âtrue molarâ NAD+/NADH ratio. We thought that, by normalizing samples it might decrease the likelihood that these data would be misperceived to a quantitative representation of the true cellular NAD+/NADH (which we have found to be a common misunderstanding). Nonetheless, we agree that is confusing to present a ârelative ratioâ and so we have changed all LCMS derived NAD+/NADH measurements to a simple ratio of ion counts, changing the Y axis legend to include âa.u./a.u.â to hopefully make this caveat apparent, as below:</p><p>In addition, we added the following text to the âLiquid Chromatography-Mass Spectrometry (LCMS)â section of the Materials and methods, to describe these caveats:</p><p>âIsotopically labeled standards for NAD+ and NADH are not widely available, so LCMS experiments measuring NAD+/NADH ratios do not incorporate differences in ionization efficiencies or matrix effects for each analyte. Thus, while changes in the ratio of measured ion counts for NAD+ and NADH reflect biological changes, they should not be interpreted as an absolute intracellular ratio, which is more accurately quantified by enzymatic methods. Individual ion counts for NAD+ and NADH are available in Supplementary File 1.â</p><p>2) Compartmentalized measurements of redox changes</p><p>Our data indicate that decreases in mitochondrial NAD+/NADH are required for the aspartate synthesis and proliferative benefits of complex I inhibition in SDH impaired cells, as evidenced by the result that these benefits can be blunted by expression of mitoLbNOX, but not cytoLbNOX. The lack of benefit for cytoLbNOX was expected since these cells are cultured in the presence of media pyruvate, which makes cytoLbNOX redundant for maintaining cytosolic NAD+/NADH. To underscore this experimental detail, we edited the text to make this point more clearly:</p><p>âNotably, since these cells are cultured in the presence of the cytosolic electron acceptor pyruvate, we thus expected cyto<italic>LbNOX</italic> to be redundant and ineffective to change cell metabolism, whereas mitoLbNOX would be positioned to disrupt the mitochondrial redox changes from rotenone treatment. Indeed, whereas cells expressing cyto<italic>LbNOX</italic> behaved similarly to parental cells expressing eGFP, mito<italic>LbNOX</italic> expression impeded the restorative effect of rotenone treatment on SDH-impaired cell proliferation (Figure 3E).â</p><p>Nonetheless the reviewers raise a good point that since changes in mitochondrial compartmentalized NAD+/NADH are concluded to be the driver of our phenotype, it would be reasonable to measure them directly. To do so, we combined a recently published rapid subcellular enrichment protocol for metabolomics (Lee et al., 2019) with an enzymatic NAD+/NADH assay that allows measurements on NAD+/NADH from low sample input (protocol optimized in Sullivan et al., 2015), allowing us to separately measure NAD+/NADH from the cytosolic and mitochondrial fractions. We found that in basal conditions, as expected, cytosolic NAD+/NADH was higher than mitochondrial NAD+/NADH, indicating that the assay was likely reflecting endogenous redox differences between compartments (Revised Manuscript Figure 3B). Notably, mitochondrial inhibitors only had small effects on cytosolic NAD+/NADH, which was expected in this experimental context since exogenous pyruvate in the media can fix the cytosolic NAD+/NADH ratio through lactate dehydrogenase. We did however observe large changes in mitochondrial NAD+/NADH, where rotenone lowered the ratio, AA5 increased the ratio, and rotenone was epistatic to AA5 with regards to the effects on mitochondrial NAD+/NADH in co-treated cells. The disproportionate amount of NADH in the mitochondrial compartment thus likely drives the âwhole cellâ NAD+/NADH changes observed by LCMS in the Revised Manuscript Figures 1D, 3A, and 7D, We believe these data provide important corroborative evidence for the conclusion of this figure that mitochondrial redox changes are required for the benefits of CI inhibition in SDH impaired cells.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>4) The data presentation needs to be clearer and to be more consistent. For example, the Asp recovery experiments are sometimes presented using log scales which make very small changes in Asp levels appear much more substantial than they are; linear scales may be more appropriate and easier to interpret. The metabolite measurement data would also be clearer if presented as normalized ion counts rather than relative amounts; the ion counts should at the very least be provided somewhere in the manuscript.</p></disp-quote><p>We thank the reviewers for this suggestion and opportunity to improve the interpretability of the manuscript. Since SDH loss causes a severe depletion in aspartate by ~90% to a regime where small changes in aspartate levels can have large changes in proliferation rate (Revised Manuscript Figure 1C), we initially thought that a continuous log axis would be a fairer depiction of the data. It was certainly not our intention to mislead the readers and so we are happy to change the presentation to avoid that impression. We also recognize that log scales can be unintuitive and so, in accordance with the reviewersâ suggestion, we have changed all the metabolite graphs to linear scales, with appropriate line breaks to allow the reader to easily see relevant changes in aspartate levels when it is decreased. We still believe that relative ion counts are easier for reader interpretation compared to raw ion counts, particularly in light of the addition of Revised Manuscript Figure 1C that should help contextualize the relationship between relative aspartate levels and proliferation rates throughout the manuscript. Nonetheless, we have further clarified the quantification details by making the Y axis labels more descriptive (to make it easier to understand the condition for which all other metabolite levels are made relative) and by describing the metabolite quantification approach in detail in the methods section. Finally, to assuage any further concerns, we have included all ion counts used to generate the relative metabolite level graphs in Revised Manuscript Supplementary File 1.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>5) In the current version of the manuscript, key data are not always consistent between panels. For example, the recovery of proliferation in SDH inhibited cells by rotenone appears somewhat inconsistent between experiments (e.g. Figure 2A and Figure S3B). As another example, in Figure 1, SDHB expression in UOK269 cells led to a proliferation rate that was nearly 5X higher than the control cells. Yet in Figure 2l, the proliferation rate of UOK269 cells expressing SDHB is the same as those not expressing SDHB. Further still, in 1F, addition of AA5 without PYR leads to minimal change in the NAD+/NADH ratio, while in 3A, sole addition of AA5 roughly doubles the NAD+/NADH ratio. The lack of consistency between panels is a recurrent problem throughout the manuscript and it is critical that the authors address these inconsistencies.</p></disp-quote><p>We apologize for this misunderstanding. While some variability in proliferation rates is a natural feature of conducting these experiments, the reviewers astutely noted several situations where the variability could be misinterpreted as potentially suggesting non-reproducible results, which is not the case. We have repeated each of the indicated experiments (and many others) and replaced them as necessary to ensure that the most representative experimental results are displayed.</p><p>However, we believe the discrepancies noted by the reviewers for UOK269 cells and NAD+/NADH relate to confusion about the media conditions used for each experiment, rather than inconsistent data. For example, the â5X higherâ proliferation rate is true if comparing the proliferation rates of WT UOK269 cells in pyruvate-free DMEM (Original Submission Figure 1I/Revised Manuscript Figure 1G) to those cultured in DMEM with 1 mM pyruvate (Original Submission Figure 2I/Revised Manuscript Figure 8E). However, if the reviewers compare the proliferation rates of each cell line in the +PYR condition, they will see they are similar across figures. Likewise, the NAD+/NADH measurements of Original Submission 1F/Revised Manuscript Figure 1D are actually well in line with the data in Original Submission 3A/Revised Submission 3A, if comparing the +PYR conditions in the Figure 1 panel to those in Figure 3, which are from cells cultured in pyruvate containing media. Nonetheless, this perception of inconsistent results was our fault because we did not delineate experimental details clearly enough to guide the reader to the correct comparisons across figure panels. To address this issue, we have made several edits throughout the manuscript to remind the reader that all experiments after Figure 1 are conducted in media containing an electron acceptor (Pyruvate or AKB, as indicated).</p><p>Examples:</p><p>1) âWe tested if, in the presence of electron acceptors, rotenone could alter the proliferation of cells treated with AA5 and, surprisingly, found it caused a robust restoration of cell proliferation (Figure 2A).â</p><p>2) Manuscript text edits highlighted in regards to âCompartmentalized measurements of redox changes,â (above):</p><p>âTo avoid potential caveats that may confound labeling patterns from unlabeled media pyruvate, we conducted U-13C glucose isotope tracing experiments in pyruvate-free DMEM with AKB, which serves a similar electron acceptor function as pyruvate but cannot fulfill its carbon fates (Figure 1A) (Altea-Manzano et al., 2022; Sullivan et al., 2015). We also confirmed that rotenone is still effective to restore proliferation and aspartate levels of SDH-impaired cells in pyruvate-free DMEM with AKB (Figure 4âfigure supplement 1B, 1C).â</p><p>3) In the discussion:</p><p>âAdditionally, we note that SDH/CI impaired cells also require a supply of cytosolic electron acceptors to proliferate, indicating that this metabolic state depends on intercompartmental metabolic differences including a reduced mitochondrial compartment and an oxidized cytosolic environment.â</p><p>In addition, we have revised every figure legend for which the presence or absence of an electron acceptor (i.e. pyruvate or AKB) is a relevant variable for the experimental output to include the media condition explicitly. We hope these edits will help dispel any potential interpretation of variable results and aid in interpretation of our findings.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>6) As detailed in the individual responses, several panels lack important controls and the appropriate statistical comparisons are not always included.</p></disp-quote><p>As suggested, we have repeated experiments to include important controls and have added the appropriate statistics corresponding to the individual reviewer comments.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>7) Some of the data included in the manuscript does not add support to the model. For example, data regarding the combinatorial treatment of cells with AA5+AZD7545 (Figures 3G-H) shows only slight changes in proliferation and aspartate levels. This adds little to the argument that mitochondria-specific alterations in NAD+/NADH and aspartate biosynthesis are responsible for proliferation in the context of SDH inhibition.</p></disp-quote><p>We appreciate the reviewers concern for unnecessary data, but we respectfully disagree that these data do not add support to the model. While our mitoLbNOX data indicate that decreases in mitochondrial NAD+/NADH are required for the aspartate production and proliferative benefits of CI inhibition in SDH impaired cells, they do not necessarily confirm that decreased mitochondrial NAD+/NADH is sufficient to increase aspartate and proliferation in the absence of a CI inhibitor. We believe that the fact that AZD7545 increases aspartate and cell proliferation without blocking oxygen consumption provides evidence that decreased mitochondrial NAD+/NADH is both required and sufficient to induce aspartate and proliferation, without inherently requiring an ETC inhibitor. Nonetheless we agree that the very small effect sizes may confuse readers. So, we have de-emphasized these data in the revised manuscript by moving them to the supplemental figures (Revised Manuscript Figure 3âfigure supplement A-E) and edited the manuscript to more accurately describe the effect sizes and clarify our interpretation:</p><p>âImportantly, treatment with AZD7545 also slightly improved cell proliferation and increased aspartate levels in AA5 treated cells (Figure 3âfigure supplement 2D, 2E). Notably, these effects are likely limited by the fact that they are occurring in the presence of intact CI activity, which would likely buffer major changes in mitochondrial NAD+/NADH. Nonetheless, these data provide additional support that compartment-specific mitochondrial redox alterations are both sufficient and required to reprogram aspartate synthesis in SDH-impaired cells (Figure 3G).â</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>8) Could the authors address/discuss the physiological relevance of their findings. Do CI subunits exhibit decreased expression in SDH-deficient tumors in patients? Is this a phenomenon of cell culture or is this also observed in vivo? Could more physiological oxygen tension (or even hypoxia) affect SDH-deficient cell proliferation?</p></disp-quote><p>We thank the reviewers for bringing up this important point. Due to the rarity of these tumors, acquiring sufficient patient samples to analyze expression patterns of CI subunits on SDH-deficient tumors is difficult at the current moment. We did however seek to increase the physiological relevance of our findings, as suggested by the reviewers, by measuring these phenotypes in physiological oxygen tensions and in a tumor model. First, we asked whether decreased oxygen was sufficient to promote the proliferation of SDH impaired cells in the absence of a CI inhibitor. We conducted paired experiments culturing 143B cells in either 21% O<sub>2</sub> (in a standard tissue culture incubator) or at 11%, 5%, 3%, or 1% O<sub>2</sub> in a hypoxia chamber (See âProliferation Assaysâ in the Materials and methods section for details). Interestingly, we found that physiological oxygen tensions were unable to significantly increase cell proliferation of AA5 treated cells from 3% or above, but that severe hypoxia at 1% O2 was able to partially improve the proliferation of AA5 treated cells, albeit to a lesser degree than rotenone (Revised Manuscript Figure 3âfigure supplement 1D). These data suggest that severe hypoxia may benefit the proliferation of SDH deficient tumor cells and also provide plausibility that CI loss would be beneficial to SDH deficient cells at physiological oxygen concentrations in vivo.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Reviewer #1 (Recommendations for the authors):</p><p>1. The Asp recovery experiments are hard to interpret.</p><p>The panels showing Asp levels (e.g. in Figure 1D, 2B, 1G, 3E, 1H) would be easier for the reader to interpret if they were shown with a linear scale on the y-axis. On a linear scale the recovery of Asp by rotenone treatment in SDH inhibited cells (Figure 2B) would look quite minor compared to the loss of Asp that is caused by SDH inhibition. The authors also use different non-linear scales to show Asp levels in different panels of the same figure (e.g. Figure 2G and J), which is especially confusing.</p><p>Comparison of Asp rescue between different conditions is also challenging. For example, the recovery of Asp caused by &quot;AA5 + pyruvate&quot; (Figure 1D) appears to be greater than that caused by &quot;AA5 and rotenone&quot; (Figure 2B), yet the recovery of proliferation by &quot;AA5 + pyruvate&quot; is less. As another example, Asp levels in &quot;AA5+mitoLbNOX&quot; (Figure 3E) appear greater than Asp levels in &quot;AA5+ rotenone&quot; (Figure 2B). However, only &quot;AA5 + rotenone&quot; rescues proliferation. In other words, the relationship between Asp recovery and proliferation is not clear.</p><p>Part of the problem is that the authors use relative ion counts as well as non-linear scales. They also show the data for closely related conditions in different figures and panels. The best way to resolve the problem would be to present the data as absolute values rather than relative ion counts (e.g. fmol of Asp per cell). If this is not available, the authors should present the (normalized) ion counts (i.e. not the relative ion counts) on a linear scale, with error bars representing the variance of the ion counts. The authors do this in Figure 4B and it is much clearer.</p><p>Do the authors have the data from a control sample (143B wild-type cells) that could be included in Figure 4B, so that the reader could see how the rescue of Asp by SDHB KO compares to wild-type levels? Incidentally, Figure 4A would also be easier to interpret if the proliferation rate of wild-type 143B cells were also included.</p><p>More generally, if the experiments were performed at the same time, it would be helpful if the data for all the conditions were to be collated in a Sup. Table so that the recovery of Asp between different conditions can easily be compared.</p><p>As a result of this uncertainty in the extent of Asp recovery, the proposed rescue of Asp as a factor in facilitating proliferation in SDH and CI inhibition is not convincing. Right now, a key question can't be assessed by the reader: how much Asp is needed for proliferation? The quantitative relationship between Asp levels and proliferation should be made clearer.</p></disp-quote><p>These concerns are addressed in detail in response to Essential Revisions Comment 1. In brief, we have changed the presentation of aspartate levels to linear scales, standardized the presentation of aspartate levels amongst conditions, included ion counts for all LCMS data in Supplementary File 1, repeated experiments including additional control samples, and generated dose response curves that compare the effects of mitochondrial inhibitors on aspartate and proliferation to contextualize changes in aspartate throughout the manuscript (see revised submission Figure 1C; Figure 1âfigure supplement 1K-L). We believe this latter point is a substantial improvement to the manuscript and so thank the reviewer again for the suggestion.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>2. The data relating NAD+/NADH to the rescue of Asp and proliferation is not entirely convincing and is quite hard to interpret (Figure 1F, G).</p><p>i) It is not quite clear what is being measured in Figure 1F. The NAD+/NADH ratio reported in the Figure (i.e. ratio is approx. &quot;1&quot; for controls) is far lower than values that are reported in the literature for this cell line using a different approach (e.g. in the corresponding authors previous work with this cell line) or using carefully validated methods to extract NAD from other cell lines (e.g. by the Rabinowitz group, 2018, Antioxid Redox Signal.). It may be too much to ask the authors to redo the experiments using standards (to provide absolute amounts or concentrations), but it would easier to interpret claims about the role of redox state in these processes easier if the ratio reported here more closely reflects the intracellular NAD+/NADH ratio.</p><p>Perhaps the authors are reporting a relative ratio (a ratio of ratios?) that is normalized to the control group? If so, the figure legend isn't clear. Furthermore, having a ratio of ratios is very hard to interpret and can't be compared to previous studies or between experiments in this study. Could the authors please report either the NAD+/NADH ratio that they have measured for each group (on a linear scale), or (better) report the measured values for NAD+ and NADH (e.g. fmol per cell).</p><p>ii) Could the authors comment on the lack of an increase in the NAD+/NAD ratio in control cells when they are treated with pyruvate. Isn't this unexpected and inconsistent with previous studies? Several previous studies in very similar systems have all shown an increase in the NAD+/NADH following pyruvate treatment (e.g. Gui et al. 2016 Cell Metabolism), confirming many older studies.</p><p>iii) The authors use global NAD+/NADH measurements to infer compartment specific changes. The follow-up experiments using LbNOX are quite an indirect way to check whether this is the case. FLIM would provide some indication if the cytoplasmic and mitochondria pools of NAD(P)H are acting as proposed by the authors.</p></disp-quote><p>These concerns are addressed in detail in response to Essential Revisions Comment 3. Overall, we agree with the reviewerâs concerns â normalizing the ratios was intended to avoid the misperception that ion count ratios of NAD+ and NADH represent the true molar ratio, which cannot be done without isotopically labeled standards to account for matrix effects and differences in ionization efficiencies between analytes. Nonetheless, as detailed above, we changed all LCMS derived NAD+/NADH ratios to untransformed ratios of ion counts (with corresponding Y axis label changes to make this more obvious), explicitly describe these caveats in the Materials and methods section, and included all ion counts in Supplementary File 1. As suggested by the reviewer we also measured compartment specific NAD+/NADH changes. While we did not have access to FLIM for this purpose, we were able to leverage a rapid subcellular enrichment protocol combined with an enzymatic assay to measure compartmental changes to NAD+/NADH (see revised submission Figure 3B).</p><p>Related to comment ii, above â We agree that culturing cells in the presence of pyruvate is expected to increase NAD+/NADH, as was found in the paper mentioned, and many others. However, we respectfully disagree that our data are inconsistent with those studies. As the last author on this study was also a lead author on the referenced Gui et al. 2016 Cell Metabolism manuscript, we are able to directly compare the data from each. One issue with comparing across studies is that basal NAD+/NADH ratios were higher in the Gui paper, likely a result of using an enzyme-based assay specific for NAD+/NADH rather than LCMS (which has the caveats mentioned above). So, for the sake of comparing changes in NAD+/NADH in relevant treatment conditions across studies, we normalized each to the NAD+/NADH ratio measured in vehicle treated cells in DMEM-PYR. Importantly, regardless of differences in the cell line or measurement method, we see qualitatively similar changes upon the addition of pyruvate, rotenone, and both (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="sa2fig2">Author response image 2</xref>). We believe these data highlight that, while the ratio of ion counts detected by LCMS may not reflect a true molar ratio in NAD+/NADH, it is still a valid method to measure changes in NAD+/NADH across treatment conditions.</p><fig id="sa2fig2" position="float"><label>Author response image 2.</label><caption><title>Comparing relative changes in NAD+/NADH when adding pyruvate and/or rotenone, across studies.</title><p>NAD+/NADH measurements from the indicated figure panels in Gui et al. 2016 or this revised manuscript, with each made relative to vehicle treated cells cultured in pyruvate-free DMEM.</p></caption><graphic mimetype="image" mime-subtype="tiff" xlink:href="elife-78654-sa2-fig2-v3.tif"/></fig><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>3. A full mechanistic model is not clearly presented by the authors.</p><p>The scheme in Figure 1G presumably doesn't reflect the author's full model, and it would be informative for the authors to present their proposed mechanism somewhere in the manuscript. Right now, it is not clear (for example) how the increase of mitochondrial NADH by dual inhibition of SDH and CI leads to an increase in Asp, or how the rescued Asp levels restore proliferation in this system.</p><p>The authors address how mitochondrial NADH increase may increase Asp in the Discussion. However, the manuscript would be strengthened if these questions were addressed experimentally. For example, it is straightforward to test whether reductive carboxylation of glutamine or anaplerosis by pyruvate carboxylase is responsible for the rescue of Asp when both SDH and CI are inhibited.</p><p>Furthermore, the link between Asp levels and proliferation has been extensively described in other conditions, but not in this specific condition. Given that the role and &quot;direction&quot; of Asp metabolism varies markedly between different conditions (e.g., Birsoy et al. 2015 vs Gaude et al. 2018) the authors should test which model is operating here. E.g. are MDH1 and GOT1 operating in reverse to generate Asp that is used for biosynthetic reactions, or are GOT1 and MDH1 is operating in the forward direction to consume Asp in order to generate NAD+ for aerobic glycolysis (perhaps more plausible here?).</p><p>As a whole the manuscript covers a lot of previously covered ground (e.g. loss of SDH causes loss of CI in tumors (e.g. Fendt group)), loss of SDH and CI creates a requirement for Asp synthesis (Gottlieb group). A clear mechanism of how mitochondrial NADH rescues Asp levels and proliferation would contribute much to its novelty.</p></disp-quote><p>We thank the reviewer for raising these issues, which are addressed in detail in Essential Revisions Comment 2. Briefly, we investigated these variables by conducting stable isotope tracing, using inhibitors of reductive carboxylation of glutamine, and making genetic knockouts for PC, MPC1, GOT2, GOT1, and MDH1 to reveal mechanisms for how CI inhibition promotes aspartate synthesis and cell proliferation in SDH deficient cells. These experiments generated a substantial amount of new data, with three new Figures added to the manuscript (Revised Manuscript Figures 3-5).</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>4. Key data are not always consistent between panels</p><p>For example, the recovery of proliferation in SDH inhibited cells by rotenone appears somewhat inconsistent between experiments (e.g. Figure 2A and Figure S3B). Some variability is to be expected, but, in this version of the manuscript, the experimental variability isn't reflected in the error bars.</p></disp-quote><p>Addressed in detail in Essential Revisions Comment 2.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>5. Are the 143B cells used in these experiments capable of pyrimidine salvage?</p><p>It would be useful to know whether the 143B line that is used for most of the experiments is thymidine kinase negative (e.g, the 143B cells from ATCC are TK-). If so, this should be clearly stated in the methods, as lack of thymidine salvage will impact how these results are interpreted.</p></disp-quote><p>The 143B cells used in this study are from ATCC and are indeed TK-. However, this variable is unlikely to be a critical effector of this phenotype since DMEM does not contain thymidine (or any other nucleosides) in its formulation and experiments were done in media containing dialyzed FBS. In addition, our results were recapitulated in several other cell lines that are capable of thymidine salvage, without any discernable differences. Nonetheless, we aim to be fully transparent in our methods and so this information has been added to the Materials and methods (Cell Culture).</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>6. The rescue by AZD7545 does not add support to the model</p><p>The rescue of proliferation and especially Asp levels by AZD7545 is so small that if is hard to assess its importance. Is a difference between ~27% and ~31% of wild-type Asp levels really meaningful? When placed on a linear scale it would be hard to discern a difference between Asp levels in these groups.</p></disp-quote><p>Addressed in detail in Essential Revisions Comment 7.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Reviewer #2 (Recommendations for the authors):</p><p>1. While quite interesting, the physiological relevance of SDH and ETC complex I inhibition is unclear. Do CI subunits exhibit decreased expression in SDH-deficient tumors in patients? Is this a phenomenon of cell culture or is this also observed in vivo? Could more physiological oxygen tension (or even hypoxia) affect SDH-deficient cell proliferation?</p></disp-quote><p>Addressed in detail in Essential Revisions Comment 8. We believe the addition of the added hypoxia proliferation assays and inducible NDI1 xenograft tumor experiment add important physiological context to the study.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>2. The data regarding the importance of aspartate biosynthesis in the context of SDH inhibition are mostly correlative and lack important controls.</p><p>a. Figure 1C â How was the dose selected for Asp treatment in the SLC1A3-expressing cells? While the tracing data confirms the increased uptake of Asp relative to non-SLC1A3 expressing cells (S1B-C), the authors do not report Asp levels or indicate how the dosage was selected.</p><p>b. Figures 1I and S1K â SDHB expression in UOK269 cells permitted glutamine-dependent aspartate biosynthesis and increased cell proliferation, yet the authors did not report how SDHB expression affected aspartate levels.</p><p>c. The authors are inconsistent in their interpretation of meaningful changes in aspartate. For example, regarding Figure 1E, the authors investigated the M4 aspartate isotopomer derived from U-13C-glutamine and conclude that pyruvate is insufficient to restore progression through the TCA cycle in AA5 treated cells because it resulted in only a 2.8X increase; yet in Figure 2B the authors observed a 2.3X increase in aspartate levels in cells treated with AA5 + rotenone, which leads the authors to conclude that CI and SDH co-inhibition partially restored aspartate levels.</p><p>d. Is the increase in proliferation upon SDH and CI inhibition dependent on GOT?</p></disp-quote><p>We thank the reviewers for the opportunity to clarify these issues:</p><p>a. We selected 1 mM aspartate for the indicated experiment (now Revised Manuscript Figure 1âfigure supplement 1D) by identifying an aspartate dose that was sufficiently high to allow robust incorporation of media aspartate into SLC1A3 expressing cells (as measured in Revised Manuscript Figure 1âfigure supplement 1C) and would be unlikely to be depleted over the course of a four-day proliferation assay. The goal of this experiment was to determine the magnitude cell proliferation changes upon SDH inhibition when ASP was not limiting, so an excess was desired. Nonetheless we estimated that 1 mM media aspartate would be reasonable based on net glutamine consumption (glutamine consumption â glutamate excretion) that we previously measured (Sullivan et al., 2018 <italic>Nature Cell Biology</italic>) to be around 170 fmol/cell*hour in 143B cells â resulting in a consumption of around 2.5 mM glutamine from the media during a standard proliferation assay (based on ~6E7 total cell-hours, 4 mL media with 4 mM glutamine starting concentration). Since glutamine is used for intracellular demands for glutamine, glutamate, aspartate, and aspartate fates (asparagine, pyrimidines, purines) we estimate that roughly 50% (+/- 25%) of glutamine consumption would be used towards aspartate and its fates, and so 1 mM aspartate would approximately meet those demands in the absence of functional aspartate synthesis.</p><p>b. Our apologies for this oversight â this data is now available in Revised Manuscript Figure 1âfigure supplement 1N and Figure 8âfigure supplement 1E.</p><p>c. We agree that changes in aspartate levels could be better presented and have overhauled our presentation of them (see reply to Essential Revisions Comment 1). We hope the reviewer will agree that the interpretation of meaningful aspartate changes is now consistent throughout the manuscript, especially when contextualized by Revised Manuscript Figure 1C.</p><p>d. This question is addressed in detail in response to Essential Revisions Comment 2 and by Revised Manuscript Figure 6.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>3. Overstatements of results reduce clarity of the findings. For example:</p><p>a. The authors argument that &quot;SDH inhibition blocks proliferation, which is restored by aspartate but not electron acceptors&quot; (Figure 1 title) seems to be an overstatement. Though aspartate seems to increase cell proliferation to a greater degree than electron acceptors, data presented in 1A and 1C indicate that pyruvate, AKB, and LbNOX are all sufficient to increase cell proliferation.</p><p>b. The presented correlations between aspartate levels and proliferation are not sufficient evidence that aspartate biosynthesis is the primary mode of supporting cell proliferation in SDH-deficient cells. For example, in Supp. Figure 2B-C aspartate levels are not rescued to the same extent as proliferation across the panel of cell lines.</p><p>c. Data regarding the combinatorial treatment of cells with AA5+AZD7545 (Figures 3G-H) shows only slight changes to proliferation and aspartate levels. This adds little to the argument that mitochondria-specific alterations in NAD+/NADH and aspartate biosynthesis are responsible for proliferation in the context of SDH inhibition.</p></disp-quote><p>We are happy to have the ability to correct the text to avoid overstating our results:</p><p>a. This is a good point, we have changed the Figure 1 title to: âSDH inhibition blocks proliferation, which is incompletely rescued by electron acceptors but robustly restored by aspartateâ</p><p>b. We have provided a detailed response with corresponding new data in the response to Essential Revisions Comment 2, which we hope the reviewer will agree provides data to support our conclusion that aspartate synthesis is a metabolic limitation for cell proliferation in SDH impaired cells. While we agree that different cell lines have different relationships between the degree of aspartate and proliferation rescue upon CI co-inhibition, these findings are in line with the non-linear relationship we found between aspartate levels and proliferation rate during mitochondrial inhibition (Revised Manuscript Figure 1C). The variability in aspartate levels and proliferation rate is likely a consequence of cell intrinsic differences in starting aspartate concentration, efficacy of the inhibitors to impair their target, and sensitivity differences to changes in aspartate levels. Nonetheless, we believe that the similar qualitative changes in aspartate and proliferation upon SDH and CI inhibition across cell lines supports the generalizability of our findings.</p><p>c. This comment is addressed in detail in response to Essential Revisions Comment 7.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>4. Statistical analysis was frequently missing or improperly conducted. For example, regarding panel 1A the authors noted that AA5 and rotenone treatment decreased cell proliferation and that co-treatment with pyruvate, AKB, LbNox, or Asp restored proliferation. Statistical comparisons were made between AA5 and rotenone for all groups; however, based on the text, the statistical analysis should be restricted to comparisons between groups for each AA5 and rotenone.</p></disp-quote><p>This point is well taken, and we have reorganized Figure 1A to make the appropriate comparisons clear and added appropriate statistical tests throughout the manuscript.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>5. The data presentation throughout the manuscript is confusing. For example, in some panels the y-axis is log-scale while in complimentary panels the y-axis is linear, and for some graphs the y-axis does not start at 0.</p></disp-quote><p>We have overhauled our data presentation in accordance with the reviewer critiques, see detailed response to Essential Revisions Comment 1.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>6. In Figure 1, SDHB expression in UOK269 cells led to a proliferation rate that was nearly 5X higher than the control cells. Yet in Figure 2l, the proliferation rate of UOK269 cells expressing SDHB is the same as those not expressing SDHB. Why are the proliferation rates different?</p></disp-quote><p>We believe that apparent inconsistency is a misunderstanding based on comparing cells grown in different media conditions, a result of insufficient labeling clarity on our previous draft.

We agree that the association of mtDNA CI mutations with the disease raises the possibility that a loss of CI activity is beneficial, however no functional experiments are done in this study to test that hypothesis. It remains to be seen if these cancers (or others associated with mtDNA CI mutations, as mentioned in our Discussion) are truly driven to grow by the loss of CI activity per se, or as a result of another consequence of those mutations. We speculate that the finding that these oncocytomas are exclusively driven by mutations in the mtDNA, and not by mutations in CI subunits encoded by nuclear DNA, would suggest a more complicated mechanism than simply CI loss driving transformation and proliferation. The second paper (Garmier et al.) does investigate the functional effects of CI inhibition by rotenone treatment in Arabidopsis cells, measuring effects on cell growth and metabolic state. Importantly though, the authors note defects in cell growth upon rotenone treatment, in contrast to the effects observed in SDH impaired cells in our study. We believe a major novelty distinction between the listed studies and ours is the finding of experimental conditions where CI inhibition benefits cell proliferation rate and the characterization of the metabolic variables that govern that effect.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>While we appreciate that many of the scripts used to generate data within this work are using pre-existing toolkits, it is still important to present the code used (how the toolkits were used exactly) to aid in the reproducibility of the work.
