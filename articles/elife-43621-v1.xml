Early studies established that <italic>Mycobacterium tuberculosis</italic> (Mtb) isolated from mouse lungs preferentially metabolizes fatty acids ex vivo (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Bloch and SEGAL, 1956</xref>). It is known that Mtb upregulates genes needed for fatty acid utilization during infection in macrophages, mouse challenge models, and within human lung tissues (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Fontán et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Homolka et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">Rachman et al., 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">Rohde et al., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Rohde et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">Schnappinger et al., 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">Tailleux et al., 2008</xref>). Functional experiments have also established that Mtb can import and metabolize fatty acids (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Lee et al., 2013</xref>) or the acyl-chains derived from triacylglycerol (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Daniel et al., 2011</xref>), and fluorescent fatty acid trafficking studies have visualized the presence of lipid inclusions in intracellular Mtb (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Podinovskaia et al., 2013</xref>).</p><p>TB disease pathology may also contribute to Mtb’s metabolic preference for lipids given that the bacterium resides within tissue environments that are laden with lipid substrates. In human granulomatous lesions, intracellular Mtb resides in foamy macrophages (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Peyron et al., 2008</xref>) and these cells are known to concentrate triacylglycerol, cholesterol, and cholesterol esters (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Almeida et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">McClean and Tobin, 2016</xref>). Additionally, the caseous centers of necrotic TB lesions are enriched in these same lipids and extracellular bacteria are commonly found embedded in this nutrient-rich material (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Cáceres et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Hunter et al., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Kim et al., 2010</xref>).</p><p>Although the principles of fatty acid uptake in Mtb are poorly understood, we recently discovered that Rv3723/LucA and the Mce1 transporter complex are required for fatty acid import (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Nazarova et al., 2017</xref>). Given that these proteins are needed for full Mtb virulence in murine infection models (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Joshi et al., 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Nazarova et al., 2017</xref>), we sought to identify additional genes that are involved in this process. Here, we use a forward genetic screen and a fluorescence-activated cell sorting (FACS) approach to identify Mtb mutants deficient in Bodipy-palmitate import during macrophage infection. This approach identified novel genes (<italic>rv2799</italic>, <italic>rv0966c</italic>, <italic>rv0655</italic>/<italic>mceG</italic>, and <italic>rv0200</italic>/<italic>omamB</italic>) and confirmed that genes encoding putative components the Mce1 transporter and Rv3723/LucA facilitate fatty acid import in Mtb. Together these data support our previous findings and are consistent with the concept that fatty acid import in Mtb is mediated by a network of shared and dedicated proteins that import fatty acids via Mce transporter in Mtb.</p></sec><sec id="s2" sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><sec id="s2-1"><title>Genetic approach to identify fatty acid import mutants</title><p>Rv3723/LucA is required for both fatty acid and cholesterol import in Mtb (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Nazarova et al., 2017</xref>), and we have demonstrated that a robust phenotype of a Mtb mutant lacking Rv3723/LucA (∆<italic>lucA</italic>::hyg) is the inability of this strain to import the fluorescent fatty acid substrate, Bodipy-palmitate during infection in macrophages. Since this trait is easily quantifiable by flow cytometric analysis we developed a FACS-based assay to isolate additional mutants that are defective in Bodipy-palmitate import. For this FACS-based screen, we infected macrophages with a Mtb strain that constitutively expresses mCherry and at 3 days post-infection the macrophages were pulse labeled with Bodipy-palmitate. Following the Bodipy-palmitate labeling procedure, the infected macrophages were lysed and intracellular bacteria were isolated on a sucrose cushion for flow cytometry analysis or sorting based on Bodipy-palmitate incorporation into the bacterial cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1A</xref>) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Nazarova et al., 2018</xref>).</p><fig id="fig1" position="float"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.43621.002</object-id><label>Figure 1.</label><caption><title>Developing a screening approach to identify fatty acid import mutants in Mtb.</title><p>(<bold>A</bold>) Schematic of the genetic screen. Macrophages are infected with mCherry-Mtb for three days.

Briefly, we infected macrophages with each strain, pulse-labeled infected cells with the fluorescent substrate, and measured bacterial incorporation of Bodipy-palmitate by flow cytometry. These strains allowed us to establish a sorting method that isolated mCherry-positive singlet bacteria that are Bodipy-low. Analysis of lysates from uninfected macrophages confirmed that this methodology exclusively captured bacterial cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1B and C</xref>). Applying this sorting strategy to the ∆<italic>lucA</italic>::hyg mutant confirmed that this strain incorporated less Bodipy-palmitate relative to WT (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1D</xref>). For further validation of this FACS-based screening approach, we isolated WT and ∆<italic>lucA</italic>::hyg bacteria from Bodipy-palmitate pulse-labeled macrophages and combined these bacterial populations at a ratio of 1:1. We FACS sorted this mixed bacterial sample into Bodipy-low (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1B</xref>) and excluded the Bodipy-high populations (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1D</xref>). Flow analysis determined that sorted bacterial Bodipy-low population approached ~84% purity (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1E</xref>). Using the hygromycin-resistance marker carried by the ∆<italic>lucA</italic>::hyg mutant, we evaluated the specificity of this sorting procedure by plating on selective agar. Of the sorted cells in the desired Bodipy-low population 98.68 ± 1.31% of the recovered colonies were hygromycin-resistant, demonstrating that the majority of sorted population were indeed ∆<italic>lucA</italic>::hyg bacteria indicating the high degree of specificity with this approach.</p></sec><sec id="s2-2"><title>Isolating and identifying fatty acid import mutants</title><p>Using this FACS-based approach, we sought to isolate mutants with a reduced ability to import Bodipy-palmitate. Using the MycoMarT7 transposon (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">Sassetti et al., 2001</xref>) delivered by phage transduction (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Bardarov et al., 1997</xref>), we generated a transposon mutant library (~2×10<sup>4</sup> mutants) in a Mtb Erdman strain which expresses mCherry from a chromosomally integrated plasmid (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">Stover et al., 1991</xref>). For screening, macrophages were infected with the mutant library, pulse labeled with the fluorescent substrate, and the Bodipy-low bacteria were isolated by FACS. On the day of the experiment, sorting gates were established using WT and ∆<italic>lucA</italic>::hyg bacteria isolated from Bodipy-palmitate-labeled macrophages. Events falling within Bodipy-low gate were sorted and plated onto selective media. Of the 10<sup>5</sup> events collected in the Bodipy-low sort, only ~12.8% (~1.28×10<sup>4</sup>) gave rise to colonies. For comparison, when the Bodipy-low population was sorted from the 1:1 mixture containing WT and ∆<italic>lucA</italic>::hyg strains ~ 71.9 ± 0.67% of the sorted events produced colonies. The reduced recovery of mutant bacteria from the Bodipy-low population suggests that a large proportion (~60%) of the clones are non-viable or non-culturable with our plating conditions. To isolate mutants with a strong Bodipy-palmitate import defect, we employed an enrichment strategy. Following the second enrichment sort, 10<sup>5</sup> Bodipy-low events were collected, and ~5.3×10<sup>4</sup> (53%) of this population yielded viable colonies.

Specifically, we proposed that Mce1 is a dedicated fatty acid transporter and LucA is a shared protein which interacts with Mce1 and Mce4 subunits to facilitate Mce1- and Mce4-mediated import of fatty acids and cholesterol, respectively (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Nazarova et al., 2017</xref>). The link between LucA and the Mce1/Mce4 transporters suggests that fatty acid and cholesterol import is coordinated in Mtb and this may reflect the abundance of fatty acids and cholesterol within the macrophage niche. Thus, to build on our proposed model, we sought to identify additional proteins in this network that facilitate fatty acid import by Mtb during infection in macrophages.</p><p>Our model proposes that genes in the <italic>mce1</italic> operon encode the core subunits of a Mce1 fatty acid transporter. Consistent with this idea our screen selected numerous mutants with transposon insertions in the <italic>mce1</italic> operon. We identified and tested a representative mutant with an insertion in this operon (<italic>rv0172/mce1D</italic>) and confirmed that this mutant is defective in fatty acid import and metabolism of fatty acids (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3</xref>). Our TraSH-based analyses also identified six total genes in the <italic>mce1</italic> operon that were overrepresented following the enrichment screen (<italic>rv0168/yrbE1B</italic>, <italic>rv0169/mce1A</italic>, <italic>rv0171/mce1C</italic>, <italic>rv0172/mce1D</italic>, <italic>rv0175/mam1A</italic>, and <italic>rv0176/mam1B</italic> (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="fig2sdata1">Figure 2—source data 1</xref>). This analysis also revealed that mutations in genes encoding the orphaned Mce accessory subunits (<italic>rv0199</italic>/<italic>omamA</italic> and <italic>rv0200</italic>/<italic>omamB</italic>) were overrepresented in our enrichment screen. Consistent with this prediction, a transposon mutant with an insertion in <italic>rv0200</italic>/<italic>omamB</italic> has a reduced ability to import and metabolize fatty acids (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3</xref>). The accessory subunit, Rv0199/OmamA is known to interact with Rv3723/LucA (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Nazarova et al., 2017</xref>) and to stabilize the Mce1 complex (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Perkowski et al., 2016</xref>). It is possible that OmamB and OmamA function jointly to stabilize Mce1 through interactions with Rv3723/LucA. It has long been hypothesized that the putative ATPase, Rv0655/MceG provides energy for all Mce transporters in Mtb (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Joshi et al., 2006</xref>). Rv0655/MceG has been shown to be required for cholesterol metabolism in Mtb (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Pandey and Sassetti, 2008</xref>), and however, in <italic>Mycobacterium smegmatis</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">García-Fernández et al., 2017</xref>), its role in fatty acid assimilation had not been described previously. Among the mutants tested here <italic>rv0655/mceG</italic> had the strongest defect in fatty acid import and metabolism (comparable to <italic>rv3723</italic>/<italic>lucA</italic>), supporting its essential role in these processes (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3</xref>). Thus, given that we identified a number of Mce1 subunits in the screen, we conclude that Mce1 functions as a fatty acid transporter within the macrophage environment (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3C</xref>).</p><p>This screen also identified genes that had not been previously linked to fatty acid import in Mtb. Mutant with an insertion in <italic>rv0966c</italic> has a reduced ability to import Bodipy-palmitate during macrophage infection and this mutant also has a reduced ability to import and metabolize fatty acids in liquid culture (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3</xref>). The putative protein encoded by <italic>rv0966</italic> contains a domain of unknown function (DUF1707) that is commonly found in proteins from Actinomycetal species. The gene <italic>rv0966c</italic> is highly expressed in a mouse infection model (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">Talaat et al., 2007</xref>) but more work will be needed to determine how Rv0966c facilitates fatty acids import in Mtb.</p><p>Inactivation of Rv2583c/RelA dramatically increases fatty acid metabolism in Mtb, yet this mutant imports less Bodipy-palmitate during macrophage infection (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3A</xref>). Rv2583c/RelA mediates the stringent response following nutrient deprivation by regulating levels of (p)ppGpp (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Avarbock et al., 1999</xref>). RelA is required for long-term survival of Mtb in vitro and in vivo; however, deletion of RelA is reported to have no effect on Mtb growth during short-term macrophage infections (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Dahl et al., 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Klinkenberg et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Primm et al., 2000</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib41">Weiss and Stallings, 2013</xref>). Inactivation of RelA decreases the expression of <italic>mce1</italic>, <italic>mce3</italic> and <italic>mce4</italic> operons in response to starvation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Dahl et al., 2003</xref>), suggesting that Rv2583c/RelA might be involved in the regulating lipid import in an environment-dependent manner.</p><p>We recovered mutants with transposon insertions in <italic>rv3484</italic>/<italic>cpsA</italic> from both rounds of enrichment and this mutation reduces Bodipy-palmitate import during macrophage infection (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3A</xref>). The CpsA (<underline>c</underline>apsular <underline>p</underline>olysaccharide bio<underline>s</underline>ynthesis) protein participates in the ligation of arabinogalactan to peptidoglycan in the Mtb cell wall (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Grzegorzewicz et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Harrison et al., 2016</xref>). Within macrophages, bacteria lacking CpsA also fail to block LC3-associated lysosomal trafficking, instead these bacteria traffic into NADPH-oxidase-positive phagosomes for clearance by the host cell (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Köster et al., 2017</xref>). Thus, it is possible that the CpsA mutant’s defect in Bodipy-palmitate import in macrophages may be due perturbations in the bacterial cell wall, intracellular trafficking and/or a decrease in bacterial viability.</p><p>This study describes a genetic screen to identify fatty acid import mutants in Mtb. Although we focused on fatty acid import here, it is understood that a balanced utilization of cholesterol and fatty acids is significant for Mtb fitness, growth and virulence (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Lee et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Nazarova et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib42">Wilburn et al., 2018</xref>). Our ongoing work is now focused on characterizing the proteins that coordinate fatty acid and cholesterol import by Mtb. We hypothesize that fatty acid and cholesterol import in Mtb are governed by a network of proteins that facilitate metabolic adaptations to various environmental pressures that the bacteria encounter during infection (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Huang et al., 2018</xref>). Growing evidence indicates that Mtb’s metabolism is constrained within macrophages (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib40">VanderVen et al., 2015</xref>) yet is integrated to the metabolism of host cells. Thus, understanding the complex process of lipid import in Mtb during infection may shed new light on weakness in the bacterial adaptation to host environment that can be targeted with antituberculosis therapies.</p></sec><sec id="s4" sec-type="materials|methods"><title>Materials and methods</title><p>All Materials and methods are described (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Nazarova et al., 2017</xref>), unless specified otherwise.</p><sec id="s4-1"><title>Flow cytometry and sorting</title><p>Bacteria were pre-grown to mid log phase in 7H9 OAD media.

and accompanying author responses. A lightly edited version of the letter sent to the authors after peer review is shown, indicating the most substantive concerns; minor comments are not usually included.</p></boxed-text><p>Thank you for submitting your article &quot;The genetic requirements of fatty acid import by <italic>Mycobacterium tuberculosis</italic> within macrophages&quot; for consideration by <italic>eLife</italic>. Your article has been reviewed by three peer reviewers, one of whom is a member of our Board of Reviewing Editors, and the evaluation has been overseen by Gisela Storz as the Senior Editor. The following individuals involved in review of your submission have agreed to reveal their identity: William R Jacobs (Reviewer #2); Helena Boshoff (Reviewer #3).</p><p>The reviewers have discussed the reviews with one another and the Reviewing Editor has drafted this decision to help you prepare a revised submission.</p><p>Summary:</p><p>It is now well accepted that <italic>Mycobacterium tuberculosis</italic>, the causative agent of tuberculosis, is able to utilize host-derived carbon sources, including those obtained from fatty acids. The manuscript by Nazarova, Vanderven and colleagues explores this further and builds on previous work published by these authors that describe the role of LucA in stabilizing fatty acid transport systems. In this submission, the authors develop a forward genetic screen to identify genes required for fatty acid uptake. The system involves the use of a fluorescently labelled fatty acid derivative, combined with a transposon library and flow cytometry. They validate this system and appending gating strategy using the previously reported lucA mutant, which accumulates lower levels of fluorescent fatty acid when compared to the wild type.</p><p>Key findings:</p><p>1) Screening of a transposon library of <italic>M. tuberculosis</italic> in this optimized assay revealed a couple of known associations with lipid import but also revealed a few novel genes that are defective in fatty acid import.</p><p>2) The role of some genes that were predicted to be part of the Mce1 transporter or part of the <italic>mce1</italic> operon are confirmed whereas Rv0996c, a gene of unknown function, is found to play a role in lipid uptake.</p><p>3) The lipid metabolism role of several of the genes identified in the screen is further confirmed by measurement of β-oxidation of exogenously added oleic acid.</p><p>Concerns:</p><p>1) The Abstract is too diffuse and whilst it conveys the methodological approach and broad swathes of data, some specifics are needed. Perhaps mention some specific genes.</p><p>2) Figure 3—figure supplement 1 needs some form of quantification and graphic representation. It is difficult to see the differences pictorially.</p><p>3) The authors should review their citations as the key paper, of their own, is cited incorrectly.</p><p>4) Although they take advantage of wonderful tools such as transposon mutagenesis and integration proficient vectors, they do not cite the original studies in which these were described and on which their work is dependent on.</p></body></sub-article><sub-article article-type="reply" id="SA2"><front-stub><article-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.43621.015</article-id><title-group><article-title>Author response</article-title></title-group></front-stub><body><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Concerns:</p><p>1) The Abstract is too diffuse and whilst it conveys the methodological approach and broad swathes of data, some specifics are needed.
