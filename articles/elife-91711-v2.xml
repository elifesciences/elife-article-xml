unclear. <italic>Helicoverpa armigera</italic> as a notorious crop pest worldwide mainly feeds on reproductive organs of many plant species in the larval stage, and its adult draws nectar. In this study, we determined that the sucrose sensory neurons located in the contact chemosensilla on larval maxillary galea were 100–1000 times more sensitive to sucrose than those on adult antennae, tarsi, and proboscis. Using the <italic>Xenopus</italic> expression system, we discovered that Gr10 highly expressed in the larval sensilla was specifically tuned to sucrose, while Gr6 highly expressed in the adult sensilla responded to fucose, sucrose and fructose. Moreover, using CRISPR/Cas9, we revealed that Gr10 was mainly used by larvae to detect lower sucrose, while Gr6 was primarily used by adults to detect higher sucrose and other saccharides, which results in differences in selectivity and sensitivity between larval and adult sugar sensory neurons. Our results demonstrate the sugar receptors in this moth are evolved to adapt toward the larval and adult foods with different types and amounts of sugar, and fill in a gap in sweet taste of animals.</p></abstract><kwd-group kwd-group-type="author-keywords"><kwd>sucrose</kwd><kwd>gustatory receptor</kwd><kwd>cotton bollworm</kwd><kwd>CRISPR/Cas9</kwd><kwd><italic>Xenopus oocyte</italic> expression and two-electrode voltage-clamp</kwd></kwd-group><kwd-group kwd-group-type="research-organism"><title>Research organism</title><kwd>Other</kwd></kwd-group><funding-group><award-group id="fund1"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100012166</institution-id><institution>National Key R&amp;D Program of China</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>2022YFD1400800</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Wang</surname><given-names>Chen-Zhu</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund2"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100001809</institution-id><institution>National Natural Science Foundation of China</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>32130090</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Wang</surname><given-names>Chen-Zhu</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund3"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100005089</institution-id><institution>Beijing Natural Science Foundation</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>6224062</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Yang</surname><given-names>Ke</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><funding-statement>The funders had no role in study design, data collection and interpretation, or the decision to submit the work for publication.</funding-statement></funding-group><custom-meta-group><custom-meta specific-use="meta-only"><meta-name>Author impact statement</meta-name><meta-value>The sweet taste receptors in the cotton bollworm (<italic>Helicoverpa armigera</italic>) are evolved to adapt towards the larval and adult foods with different types and amounts of sugar.</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta specific-use="meta-only"><meta-name>publishing-route</meta-name><meta-value>prc</meta-value></custom-meta></custom-meta-group></article-meta></front><body><sec id="s1" sec-type="intro"><title>Introduction</title><p>Over 400,000 species of phytophagous insects live on approximately 300,000 species of vascular plants worldwide (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib60">Schoonhoven et al., 2005</xref>). Carbohydrates produced by plant photosynthesis are important nutrients for phytophagous insects. The disaccharide sucrose, the major sugar in plants, is the principal transport form of photoassimilates in higher plants. Sucrose varies considerably in concentration in green leaves, fruits, and flower nectar where it occurs together with its constituent monosaccharides fructose and glucose (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Bernays and Chapman, 1994</xref>). Sucrose, fructose, and glucose are the powerful phagostimulants for most phytophagous insects studied (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Bernays and Chapman, 1994</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Blaney and Simmonds, 1988</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Chapman, 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib60">Schoonhoven et al., 2005</xref>).</p><p>The gustatory sensory neurons (GSNs) in one or more mouthpart sensilla of phytophagous insects respond to sugars, usually including sucrose (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Chapman, 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Dethier, 1973</xref>). In Lepidoptera, caterpillars often have sugar-sensitive GSNs in lateral or medial sensilla styloconica on the maxillary galea (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Glendinning et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib42">Martin and Shields, 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib59">Schoonhoven and Loon, 2002</xref>), while adults also have sugar-sensitive GSNs in contact chemosensilla of the antennae (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Jørgensen et al., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib52">Popescu et al., 2013</xref>), tarsi (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib58">Schnuch and Seebauer, 1998</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib73">Zhang et al., 2010</xref>), and proboscis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Blaney and Simmonds, 1988</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Blaney and Simmonds, 1990</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Faucheux, 2013</xref>). The molecular basis of sugar reception in Lepidopteran insects remains unclear, although the sweet taste receptors in mammals and <italic>Drosophila melanogaster</italic> have been extensively studied (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">Liman et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib71">Yarmolinsky et al., 2009</xref>). In mammals, the combination of two taste receptors T1R2 and T1R3 recognizes sugars including sucrose (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Damak et al., 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">Li et al., 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib47">Nelson et al., 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib75">Zhao et al., 2003</xref>). In <italic>Drosophila</italic>, multiple gustatory receptors (GRs), including DmGr5a, DmGr61a, and DmGr64a–f clusters, are required for the response of adults to multiple sugars (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Dahanukar et al., 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Dahanukar et al., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Jiao et al., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Jiao et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib62">Slone et al., 2007</xref>); DmGr43a specifically responding to fructose is the major larval sugar receptor, but it is only expressed in internal organs and some parts of the brain (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib43">Mishra et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib44">Miyamoto et al., 2012</xref>).

The larvae of <italic>H. armigera</italic> mainly feeds on young leaves, flower buds, and fruits of host plants; the adults mainly drink nectar of plants. Larval and adult diets vary dramatically in the variety and concentration of sugars. Sucrose is the major sugar in plant leaves and reproductive organs, whereas flower nectar mainly contains sucrose, fructose, and glucose (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib49">Nicolson, 1998</xref>). Previous studies have shown that one sugar-sensitive GSN in <italic>H. armigera</italic> is located in each of two lateral sensilla styloconica in the larva (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib65">Tang et al., 2000</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib74">Zhang et al., 2013</xref>), and many sugar-sensitive GSNs are distributed in the numerous contact chemosensilla of antennae (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Jiang et al., 2015</xref>), tarsi (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Blaney and Simmonds, 1990</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib73">Zhang et al., 2010</xref>), and proboscis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Blaney and Simmonds, 1988</xref>) in the adult.</p><p>To understand the molecular basis of sugar reception in these neurons, we first compared electrophysiological and behavioral responses of <italic>H. armigera</italic> larvae and adults. Second, we analyzed the expression patterns of nine candidate sugar GR genes in larval and adult taste organs. Third, we carried out functional analysis of these GR genes using the ectopic expression system, and revealed the response profiles of <italic>Xenopus oocytes</italic> expressing Gr10, Gr6, and both of them. Finally, we individually knocked out the two GR genes and obtained two homozygous mutants of <italic>H. armigera</italic> by CRISPR/Cas9, and then detected changes in the electrophysiological and behavioral responses of the mutant larvae and adults to sugars. Taking all the results together, we demonstrate that larval and adult <italic>H. armigera</italic> used different GRs to detect sucrose in food.</p></sec><sec id="s2" sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><sec id="s2-1"><title>Electrophysiological responses of contact chemosensilla to sugars</title><p>We first investigated the electrophysiological responses of the lateral and medial sensilla styloconica on the larval maxillary galea to eight sugars. These sugars were chosen because they are mostly found in host-plants of <italic>H. armigera</italic> or are representative in the structure and source of sugars. The lateral sensilla styloconica showed significant unicellular responses to 10 mM sucrose and fucose, with the firing rates of 169±8.57 and 43±9.78 spikes/s, respectively (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1A</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1A</xref>). The threshold concentrations for their responses to sucrose and fucose were 0.1 mM and 10 mM, respectively (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1B</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1B</xref>). The medial sensilla styloconica had a weak response to xylose (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1C</xref>). We also compared the responses of the lateral sensilla styloconica to 0.05 mM sucrose, 5 mM fucose, and their mixture with the same concentrations, and found that the mixture induced higher responses with only one amplitude spikes and a firing rate of 71±12.36 spikes/s, which was higher than the firing rates induced by 0.05 mM sucrose (39±6.37 spikes/s) and 5 mM fucose (36±8.87 spikes/s; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1D</xref>), confirming that the same cell responded to sucrose and fucose.

The sugar content in the nectar of cotton plants is 10–34% (which roughly corresponds to 0.5 M–1.7 M; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib67">Vansell, 1944</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib68">Waller et al., 1981</xref>), and that of soybean plants is even higher, around 23–60% (which roughly corresponds to 1.2–3 M; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Free, 1993</xref>). It is clear that, in their life cycle, a single sugar-sensing mechanism cannot meet the requirements for food selection by this phytophagous insect species. From the perspective of insect and plant co-evolution, using value-based and target-specific sugar-sensing systems is a favorable choice for phytophagous insects to ensure their growth and reproduction on plants.</p><p>Although Gr10 plays a major role in sucrose reception in the larval stage, the response of the sugar GSNs in larval lateral sensilla styloconica to sucrose did not completely disappear in <italic>Gr10<sup>-/-</sup></italic> (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6A–B</xref>), and the larvae still showed a behavioral preference for the high concentration of sucrose (100 mM; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7B</xref>). It is most likely that low-level expressed Gr6 is functional in the GSNs. The PER percentage of <italic>Gr6</italic><sup>-/-</sup> adults was not disappeared when the antennae and tarsi were stimulated by high fructose concentrations (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7F and I</xref>); this indicates that fructose-tuned GRs other than <italic>Gr6</italic> were involved. Previous studies have shown that <italic>Gr9</italic> (<italic>Gr4</italic> in <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Jiang et al., 2015</xref>), as an ortholog of DmelGr43a and BmorGr9, is a fructose-tuned GR (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Ai et al., 2022</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Jiang et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib56">Sato et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib69">Xu et al., 2012</xref>). From our results, knocking out <italic>Gr10</italic> or <italic>Gr6</italic> is unlikely to be compensated by overexpression of other sugar GRs. One of our recent studies showed that <italic>Orco</italic> knockout had no significant effect on the expression of most OR, IR and GR genes in adult antennae of <italic>H. armigera</italic> although some genes were up- or down-regulated to a certain extent (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Fan et al., 2022</xref>). To elucidate the precise molecular mechanisms of sugar reception in <italic>H. armigera</italic> is necessary to compare a series of single, double and even multiple Gr knock-out lines and investigate the downstream effects of the GRs.</p><p>The larval maxillary galea with only two sensilla styloconica is an ideal system for studying the mechanisms of sugar sensing. In each maxillary galea of <italic>H. armigera</italic>, the only sugar GSN sensitive to sucrose and fucose is located in the lateral sensillum styloconicum. Based on our results, we speculate that Gr10 and Gr6 are expressed in this GSN with different levels, and mainly determine the response profile of the cell. The firing rate of the cell in <italic>Gr10<sup>-/-</sup></italic> to 1 mM, 10 mM, and 100 mM sucrose was significantly lower than that in WT, but there was no difference between WT and <italic>Gr6<sup>-/-</sup></italic>, indicating that Gr10 mainly determine the sensitivity of this cell to sucrose (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6A–B</xref>). In contrast, the firing rate of the cell in <italic>Gr6<sup>-/-</sup></italic> to 10 mM and 100 mM fucose was significantly lower than that in the WT, but there was no difference between WT and <italic>Gr10<sup>-/-</sup></italic>, indicating that Gr6 was also functional in larvae (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6A–B</xref>). This can be well explained by the response profiles of the oocytes expressing Gr10, Gr6, and their combination (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4</xref>).</p><p>Sugars are common phagostimulants in animals, but the molecular basis of sugar perception differs among animals. In mammals, the taste receptors T1R2 and T1R3 combine to complete the perception of all carbohydrate compounds, including sucrose, and both receptors are indispensable (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Damak et al., 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">Li et al., 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib47">Nelson et al., 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib75">Zhao et al., 2003</xref>). In <italic>D. melanogaster</italic> adults, multiple sugar GRs are involved in sugar reception, different GRs expressed in sweet taste neurons may function as multimers (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Dahanukar et al., 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Dahanukar et al., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Fujii et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Jiao et al., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Jiao et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib62">Slone et al., 2007</xref>). Gr5a and Gr64a are widely used for responses to complementary subsets of sugars in labellar sweet taste neurons (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Dahanukar et al., 2007</xref>), and Gr64f is also required broadly as a coreceptor for the detection of sugars (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Jiao et al., 2008</xref>). The recent successful ectopic expression of single sugar GRs in olfactory neurons confirmed that each sugar GR is directly involved in ligand recognition (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Freeman et al., 2014</xref>). Sweet sensing neurons or receptors have not been identified in the larval peripheral taste system (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Kwon et al., 2011</xref>). Sugar perception in <italic>Drosophila</italic> larvae has been assigned to the fructose receptor <italic>Gr43a</italic>, which, however, is expressed in pharyngeal sensory organs, foregut, and in the brain, but absent from external taste neurons (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib43">Mishra et al., 2013</xref>). This is most likely due to the fact that fruit fly larvae prefer to feed on rotting fruits at the optimum stage of fermentation, which contain fructose as the main sugar. Anyway, the sucrose sensing neurons were recently identified in the larval primary taste center (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib40">Maier et al., 2021</xref>). In honeybees, AmGr1 acts as a GR for certain sugars other than fructose, and AmGr2 acts as a coreceptor with AmGr1 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">Jung et al., 2015</xref>). AmGr3 is tuned to fructose and is phylogenetically closely related to the DmGr43a (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Değirmenci et al., 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib64">Takada et al., 2018</xref>). The whitefly <italic>Bemisia tabaci</italic> consistently choose diets containing higher sucrose concentrations. It has been shown that BtabGr1 displayed significant sucrose specificity when expressed in <italic>Xenopus</italic> oocytes, and silencing of this GR significantly interfered with the ability of <italic>B. tabaci</italic> adults to detect sucrose in the phloem sap (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Aidlin Harari et al., 2023</xref>).</p><p>The most studied phytophagous insects for sugar perception are Lepidopterans. BmGr9 in <italic>B. mori</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib45">Morinaga et al., 2022</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib56">Sato et al., 2011</xref>), HarmGr9 in <italic>H. armigera</italic> named as HarmGr4 by <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Jiang et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib69">Xu et al., 2012</xref>, PxGr43a-1 in <italic>P. xylostella</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">Liu et al., 2020</xref>), and SlGr8 in <italic>Spodoptera litura</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">Liu et al., 2019</xref>) were all the orthologs of DmGr43a in <italic>D. melanogaster</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib44">Miyamoto et al., 2012</xref>), and tuned to fructose without complexing with other GRs. BmGr4 was recently identified as a receptor for sucrose and glucose and may function as a chemosensor for nutritional compounds in both midgut and brain (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib41">Mang et al., 2022</xref>). In this study, we find <italic>Gr10</italic> and <italic>Gr6</italic> were highly expressed in the larval and adult taste organs, respectively. The experiments on ectopic expression in <italic>Xenopus</italic> oocytes shows that Gr10 specifically responded to sucrose, Gr6 responded to fucose and sucrose, and weakly to fructose, and the combination of Gr10 and Gr6 responded to sucrose and weakly to fucose (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4A–B</xref>). These results indicate that Gr10 and Gr6 are capable of forming functional receptors singly, and the function of the two co-expressed receptors is not equal to the sum of the functions of the two receptors (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4</xref>). When further tracing the genomic locations of the two GR genes, we confirm that <italic>Gr10</italic> and <italic>Gr6</italic> together with other 6 sugar GR genes (except for <italic>Gr9</italic>) are tandemly duplicated on the same scaffold of <italic>H. armigera</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib51">Pearce et al., 2017</xref>). The sugar GR gene cluster and interactions between GRs could provide a degree of evolutionary and regulatory flexibility that may meet the needs of the insect to sense subtle sugar components and concentrations in food sources in a changing environment (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Delventhal and Carlson, 2016</xref>). In this study, the expression patterns of nine sugar GRs in three taste organs of adult <italic>H. armigera</italic> show that there is a disparity in GRs, specifically GR5 and GR6, between the female antenna, tarsi and proboscis, which may be an evolutionary adaptation reflecting subtle differentiation in the function of these taste organs in adult foraging. Antennae and tarsi play a role in the exploration of potential sugar sources, while the proboscis plays a more precise role in the final decision to feed.</p><p>In this work, we report for the first time the molecular basis of sucrose reception in external taste neurons of a Lepidopteran insect, and discover that different taste receptors are used for food selection in <italic>H. armigera</italic> larval and adult stages. These findings greatly improve our understanding of “sweet” taste of phytophagous insects. According to the phylogenetic tree of sugar GRs in insects, <italic>Gr10</italic> is clustered in the same branch with BmorGr5 of <italic>Bombyx mori</italic>, whereas <italic>Gr6</italic> is clustered in another branch with BmorGr6 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3A</xref>). GRs closely associated with <italic>Gr10</italic> and <italic>Gr6</italic> are also found in other Lepidopteran species such as <italic>D. plexippus</italic>, <italic>H. melpomene</italic>, and <italic>P. xylostella</italic> (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3A</xref>). Therefore, we speculate that similar sugar-sensing mechanisms may also exist in other Lepidopteran species, which is worth verifying in these species in the future. Knockout of <italic>Gr10</italic> or <italic>Gr6</italic> led to a significant decrease in sugar sensitivity and food preference of the larvae and adults of <italic>H. armigera</italic>, respectively, which is bound to bring adverse consequences to the survival and reproduction of the insects. Therefore, studying the molecular mechanisms underlying sugar perception in phytophagous insects would provide new insights into the behavioral ecology of this highly diverse and important group of insects, and may also provide new means for agricultural pest control by blocking or disrupting sugar receptors.</p></sec><sec id="s4" sec-type="materials|methods"><title>Materials and methods</title><sec id="s4-1"><title>Insects</title><p><italic>Helicoverpa armigera</italic> were collected from Xuchang (Henan Province, China) and raised in an indoor environment (27 ± 1°C, 70–80% humidity) with a 16 : 8 hr light: dark cycle.

A glass capillary filled with the test compound solution, into which a silver wire was inserted, was placed in contact with the contact chemosensillum to be recorded as the recording electrode. The tip diameter of the electrode was about 50 μm, suitable for recording from a single sensillum. Action potentials (spikes) generated during the first second after stimulus onset were amplified by a preamplifier and was sampled with a computer equipped with a Metrabyte DAS16 A/D conversion board. The amplifier used an AD 515 K (Analog Devices) integrated circuit in the first stage, yielding &lt;1 pA input bias current, 1015 Ohm and 0.8 pF input impedance. An interface (GO-box) was used for signal conditioning. This involved a second-order band pass filter (–3 dB frequencies: 180 and 1700 Hz). Stimuli were dissolved in 2 mM KCl, which was used as the control. Two pentoses (arabinose and xylose), four hexoses (fructose, fucose, galactose, and glucose), and two disaccharides (sucrose and trehalose) (Appendix 1—key resources table) were used as sugar stimuli. Each sugar first tested at 10 mM to screen active compounds, which were then tested in a range of concentrations in dose-response assays (0.01 mM, 0.1 mM, 1 mM, 10 mM, and 100 mM). To avoid possible adaptation of the contact chemosensilla tested, the interval between two successive stimulations was at least 3 min. Digitized traces were analyzed by means of SAPID Tools software version 3.5 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib63">Smith et al., 1990</xref>) and Autospike 3.7 (Syntech, Buchenbach, Germany).

The test larva was starved for approximately 2 hr before recording. The head was cut and fixed in a silver holder which was connected to a preamplifier with a copper miniconnector.

The orientation of the taste organ was gently adjusted to allow the sensilla to be touched by the electrode. To guarantee the sensilla was steadily exposed, the distal part of antenna or proboscis was fixed on a small platform with double sided adhesive tape.

Because trehalose is a main sugar in insect blood, and it is converted by insects after feeding on plant sugars, we have added the new data on electrophysiological and behavioral responses of larvae and adults of Helicoverpa armigera to trehalose (see Figure 1-2, Figure 1-figure supplement 1, Figure 2-figure supplement 1). Now, the total eight sugars include 2 pentoses (arabinose and xylose), 4 hexoses (fructose, fucose, galactose and glucose), and 2 disaccharides (sucrose and trehalose), which were chosen because they are mainly present in host-plants of H. armigera and/or representative in the structure and source of sugars.</p><p>We fully agree to the reviewer’s opinion and have already taken the potential off-target effects of CRISPR/Cas9 knockout of Gr on other GR expressions into consideration. To predict the potential off-target sites of sgRNA of Gr6 and Gr10 establishing homozygous mutants using CRISPR/Cas9 technology, we first use online software CasOFFinder (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://www.rgenome.net/cas-offinder/">http://www.rgenome.net/cas-offinder/</ext-link>) to blast the genome of the wild type cotton bollworm and set the mismatch number less than or equal to 3. We found that Gr10 sgRNA had no potential potential off-target site, and the sgRNA of Gr6 had only one potential off-target site. Therefore, we designed primers according to the sequence of potential off-target sites of Gr6 sgRNA, and conducted PCR using genomic DNA of homozygous mutant as a template， performed Sanger sequencing on the PCR products obtained, and found that the potential off-target sites of Gr6 sgRNA were no different from those of the wild type. Particularly, concerning the sgRNA of Gr6 and Gr10 may produce off-target effects on other sugar receptor genes of H. armigera, we conducted the same off-target site analysis with the designed sgRNA on each of the other eight sugar receptor genes, and found that there were no off-target sites on these receptor genes (see Line254-256).</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p><bold>Reviewer #2 (Public Review):</bold></p><p>Summary:</p><p>To identify sugar receptors and assess the capacity of these genes the authors first set out to identify behavioral responses in larvae and adults as well as physiological response.

According to this suggestion, we further added some sentences probing sugar sensing and behaviors of fruit fly larvae in the Introduction and discussion sections (Line 68-71 in Introduction section, Line 395-399 in Discussion section).</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p><bold>Reviewer #3 (Public Review):</bold></p><p>In this study, the authors combine electrophysiology, behavioural analyses, and genetic editing techniques on the cotton bollworm to identify the molecular basis of sugar sensing in this species.</p><p>The larval and adult forms of this species feed on different plant parts. Larvae primarily consume leaves, which have relatively lower sugar concentrations, while adults feed on nectar, rich in sugar. Through a series of experiments-spanning electrophysiological recordings from both larval and adult sensillae, qPCR expression analysis of identified GRs from these sensillae, response profiles of these GRs to various sugars via heterologous expression in <italic>Xenopus oocytes</italic>, and evaluations of CRISPR mutants based on these parameters-the authors discovered that larvae and adults employ distinct GRs for sugar sensing.

In order to make it easy for readers to follow up, we included a sentence interprets the above data at the beginning of each part of the Results on the premise of avoiding duplication.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>(3) Could the authors please provide details of the generation and screening of the CRISPR mutants?</p></disp-quote><p>We have added more details on mutant establishment and screening in the Materials and Methods section (Line 722-726, 729-732).</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Figures: Could the authors please include images and schematics wherever possible? For example, a schematic depicting the position of the sense organs and one summarising the main findings of the studies.</p></disp-quote><p>In Figure 1 we added the photo of each taste organ, on which the recorded sensilla were indicated. We also added a new figure, Figure 8, summarizing the main findings of the study.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Choice of Sugars: Could the authors please justify their choice of sugars they have used in the analyses?</p></disp-quote><p>In the first paragraph of the Results section of the article, we further explain the reasons for using the sugars in the study. “We first investigated the electrophysiological responses of the lateral and medial sensilla styloconica in the larval maxillary galea to eight sugars. These sugars were chosen because they are mostly found in host-plants of H. armigera or are representative in the structure and source of sugars.”</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>In addition to this, there are several specific comments in the detailed reviewers comments below, which the authors could consider responding to.</p><p><bold>Reviewer #1 (Recommendations For The Authors):</bold></p><p>The article titled &quot;Sucrose taste receptors exhibit dissimilarities between larval and adult stages of a moth&quot; by Shuai-Shuai Zhang and colleagues provides an intriguing analysis. The authors have conducted a meticulously planned and executed study. However, I do have some inquiries.</p><p>(1) What precisely does the term &quot;differ&quot; signify in the title? It can be expounded upon in terms of differing in expression or sensitivity. The title could benefit from being more informative. The authors should appropriately specify the insect species in the title of the paper. This would make it more comprehensible to readers. Merely mentioning the term &quot;moth&quot; does not provide any information about the model organism. Hence, it would be preferable to mention Helicoverpa armigera instead of using the generic term &quot;moth&quot; in the title.</p></disp-quote><p>Thank you for your suggestions. We considered it better to emphasize that the receptors for sucrose are different, and we have accepted the suggestion of adding the name of the animal. The title has been changed into “The larva and adult of Helicoverpa armigera use differential gustatory receptors to sense sucrose”.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>(2) The abstract is written in a simple and easily understandable manner, but it overlooks important findings from a technical standpoint.</p></disp-quote><p>We add some key experimental techniques to illustrate some important findings in the Abstract.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>(3). Almost all herbivorous insects are said to consume plants and utilize sucrose as a stimulus for feeding, as stated by the authors. Sucrose, glucose, and fructose sugar are among the commonly observed stimulants for feeding in numerous insects. It would be appropriate to incorporate not only sucrose but also glucose and fructose as feeding stimulants for almost all herbivorous insects.</p></disp-quote><p>Thank you for your suggestion. Sucrose is the major sugar in plants, and its concentration varies greatly from tissue to tissue, while the concentration of the hexose sugars is much lower and the concentration does not change much. In Line 48, we state that sucrose, glucose, and fructose are feeding stimuli for herbivorous insects. From the previous studies, it seems that sucrose is the strongest, followed by fructose, and finally glucose. The cotton bollworm larvae showed no electrophysiological and behavioral response to glucose.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>(4) The reason why trehalose is not considered in the electrophysiology analysis is unclear. Given that trehalose is a major sugar in insects and plants, it would be intriguing to include it in the analysis.</p></disp-quote><p>We have accepted the reviewer's suggestion, and supplemented the electrophysiological responses of taste organs in larvae and adults of Helicoverpa armigera to trehalose (Figure 1, Figure 1-Figure Supplement 1), and also tested the behavioral responses of the larvae and adults to trehalose (Figure 2, Figure 2-Figure Supplement 1). Therefore, all the related figures have been changed.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>(5) The author's intention regarding the co-receptor relationship between Gr5 and Gr6 (line 211) is unclear. If this is indeed the case, then the reason for considering Gr5 in further studies remains uncertain.</p></disp-quote><p>We have changed the sentence as follows: “Since Gr5 was highly expressed with Gr6 in the proboscis and tarsi (Figure 3D-3E, Figure 3—figure supplement 1), we suspected that Gr5 and Gr6 might be expressed in the same cells, and then tested the response profile of their co-expression in oocytes.”</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>(6) The homologous nature of Grs is emphasized by the authors. It is not specified how the author ensured that the guide RNA targeting Gr6 or Gr10 did not result in off-target effects on other Grs.</p></disp-quote><p>Thank you so much for your suggestion. We have rewritten the relevant paragraph (Line 238-251), detailing our tests and the results on the potential off-target effects of knocking out GRs by CRISPR/Cas9: “In order to predict the potential off-target sites of sgRNA of Gr6 and Gr10, we used online software Cas-OFFinder (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://www.rgenome.net/cas-offinder/">http://www.rgenome.net/cas-offinder/</ext-link>) to blast the genome of H. armigera, and the mismatch number was set to less than or equal to 3. According to the predicted results, the Gr10 sgRNA had no potential off-target region but Gr6 sgRNA had one. Therefore, we amplified and sequenced the potential off-target region of Gr6-/- and found there was no frameshift or premature stop codon in the region compared to WT (Figure 5—figure supplement 2). It is worth mentioning that there was no potential off-target region of Gr6 and Gr10 sgRNA in other sugar receptor genes of H. armigera, Gr4, Gr5, Gr7, Gr8, Gr9, Gr11 and Gr12. We further found there was no difference in the response to xylose of the medial sensilla styloconica among WT, Gr10-/- and Gr6-/- (Figure 5—figure supplement 2). Furthermore, WT, Gr10-/- and Gr6-/- did not show differences in the larval body weight, adult lifespan, and number of eggs laid per female (Figure 5—figure supplement 2). All these results suggest that no off-target effects occurred in the study.”</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>(7) Is it possible that knocking out Gr10 is not compensated for by the overexpression of Gr6 or other sucrose sensing Grs? Similarly, would the vice versa scenario hold true?</p></disp-quote><p>In the Discussion section, we have added some sentences to discuss this issue: “From our results, knocking out Gr10 or Gr6 is unlikely to be compensated by overexpression of other sugar GRs. One of our recent studies showed that Orco knockout had no significant effect on the expression of most OR, IR and GR genes in adult antennae of H. armigera, but some genes were up- or down-regulated (Fan et al., 2022).”</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>(8) What was the rationale for selecting nine candidate GR genes for expression analysis?</p></disp-quote><p>Based on the reviewer's suggestion, we expanded the relevant paragraphs to illustrate the rationale for selecting nine candidate GR genes for expression analysis: “To reveal the molecular basis of sugar reception in the taste sensilla of H. armigera, we first analyzed the putative sugar gustatory receptor genes based on the reported gene sequences of GRs in H. armigera and their phylogenetic relationship of <italic>D. melanogaster</italic> sugar gustatory receptors (Jiang et al., 2015; Pearce et al., 2017; Xu et al., 2017). Nine putative sugar GR genes, Gr4–12 were identified, and their full-length cDNA sequences were cloned (The GenBank accession number is provided in Appendix—Table S1).” (Line 155-161)</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>(9) What is the potential reason for the difference between the major larval sugar receptors of <italic>Drosophila</italic> and Lepidopterans?</p></disp-quote><p>The difference between the major larval sugar receptors of <italic>Drosophila</italic> and Lepidopterans is probably due to differences in the food their larvae feed on. Fruit fly larvae feed on rotten fruit, the main sugar of which is fructose. The larvae of Lepidoptera mainly feed on plants, and the main sugar is sucrose. In the Discussion section, we have added a sentence “This is most likely due to fruit fly larvae feeding on rotten fruits, which contain fructose as the main sugar.” (Line 399-401)</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>(10) There is a disparity in GRs, specifically GR5 and GR6, between the female antenna, proboscis, and tarsi. What could be the possible justification and significance of this?</p></disp-quote><p>Thank you so much for this question. We have added a sentence in the Discussion section, “In this study, the expression patterns of 9 sugar GRs in three taste organs of adult H. armigera show that there is a disparity in GRs, specifically GR5 and GR6, between the female antenna, tarsi and proboscis, which may be an evolutionary adaptation reflecting subtle differentiation in the function of these taste organs in adult foraging. Antennae and tarsi play a role in the exploration of potential sugar sources, while the proboscis plays a more precise role in the final decision to feed.” (Line 433-438)</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>(11) I suggest that a visual representation illustrating the positioning of GSNs, particularly the lateral and medial sensilla, in both larva and adult stages would enhance the correlation with the results.</p></disp-quote><p>In Figure 1 we added the photo of each taste organ and the position of the recorded sensilla, and also added a new figure, Figure 8 summarizing the main findings of the studies.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>(12) Further experiments can be conducted to elucidate the precise molecular mechanisms, particularly the downstream effects of GRs, in order to establish the specificity of GRs more convincingly.</p></disp-quote><p>Thank you so much for your suggestion. We have discussed the further experiments in the Discussion section, “To elucidate the precise molecular mechanisms of sugar reception in H. armigera is necessary to compare a series of single, double and even multiple Gr knock-out lines and investigate the downstream effects of the GRs.” (Line 363-369)</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>(13) Figure 6 caption: In Figure 6 (D to I), the percentage of PER is depicted. There is redundancy in the Y-axis title (Percentage of PER) and the legend. This appears to be repetitive. I suggest that it would be better to include the Y-axis title only in Figure D or in Figures D and G.</p></disp-quote><p>We accept the suggestion. Figure 7 (not Figure 6) has been revised accordingly.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>(14) In Figures 6A and 6C, there is inconsistency in the colors used for WT, Gr6, and Gr10. This could potentially confuse the reader. I recommend using the same colors in both figures instead of using a blue color. Please specify how the authors calculated the feeding area in Figure 6.</p></disp-quote><p>We accept the reviewer's suggestion and have changed the color of Figure 7A, B. We have also added the detail method for calculating feeding area (Line 541-545).</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>(15) In Two-choice tests, why did the authors use 0.01% Tween 80? Please provide comments on this.</p></disp-quote><p>Use of 0.01% Tween 80 is to reduce the surface tension and increase the malleability of the solution. We have given detailed explanation in the Method section and cite the reference. (Line538-540)</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>(16) It would be valuable if the authors could comment on the prospects of this study, considering that GRs play a vital role in controlling behavior and developmental pathways. What are the potential consequences of blocking or disrupting these receptors in terms of behavioral and developmental phenotypic deformities? Could this potentially lead to increased insect mortality?</p></disp-quote><p>Thank you so much for your suggestions. In the last paragraph of the Discussion section, we have added the following perspectives, “Knockout of Gr10 or Gr6 led to a significant decrease in sugar sensitivity and food preference of the larvae and adults of H. armigera, respectively, which is bound to bring adverse consequences to survival and reproduction of the insects. Therefore, studying the molecular mechanisms underlying sugar perception in phytophagous insects may provide new insights into the behavioral ecology of this important and highly diverse group of insects, and measures blocking or disrupting sugar receptors could also have applications to control agricultural pests and improve crop yields worldwide” (Line 449-456).</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p><bold>Reviewer #2 (Recommendations for The Authors):</bold></p><p>There are a few comments, that I feel would be beneficial to be addressed.</p><list list-type="bullet"><list-item><p>The authors used 7 different sugars for their experimental approach.

Trehalose is a main sugar in insect blood. It is converted by insects after feeding on plant sugars. The 8 sugars were chosen because they are present in host-plants of H. armigera or are representative in the structure and source of sugars. They contain 2 pentoses (arabinose and xylose), 4 hexoses (fructose, fucose, galactose and glucose), and 2 disaccharides (sucrose and trehalose).</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><list list-type="bullet"><list-item><p>It might be beneficial to provide some broader overview on the gustatory system in the cotton bollworm, particularly at the larval stage since this may not be common knowledge.

According to this idea, we got the putative sugar GRs from the previously published genome (Pearce et al. 2017) and the related annotation of GRs (Jiang et al. 2015, Xu et al. 2012). We have made a more detailed explanation about this in the new version of the manuscript, “We first analyzed the putative sugar gustatory receptor genes based on the genome data of H. armigera (Pearce et al. 2017), the reported gene sequences of sugar GRs in H. armigera and their phylogenetic relationship of <italic>D. melanogaster</italic> sugar gustatory receptors (Jiang et al. 2015, Xu et al. 2012).

Can the authors please plot the PI and not the feeding area? From the PI values listed beside the plot, it actually suggests that the larvae don't really show a preference. Could the authors please comment on this?</p></disp-quote><p>Yes, sucrose has a significant stimulating effect on larva feeding, but the effect is not as large as the predicted based on the sensitivity of the sensillum, the main reasons are as follows: (1) there are many factors affecting larva feeding, sucrose is only one of them; (2) due to the substrate leaf discs also contain sugar, the effect of newly added sucrose may be reduced. After careful consideration, we think it is better to display the feeding area and PI together so that readers have a complete understanding of the data.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>(4) The heterologous expression experiments suggest that co-expression of GR6 with either GR10 or GR5 somehow suppress the response of the GR6 alone to fucose.

In this context, it would help to reproduce all the GR6 data together.</p></disp-quote><p>Your interpretation is reasonable to a certain extent. The result of co-injection might be that Gr10 or Gr5 inhibited the response of Gr6.
