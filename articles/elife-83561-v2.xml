Increased IL-10 production by neonatal B cells has been attributed to the larger population of IL-10-producting CD43<sup>+</sup> B-1 cells in neonates. Here, we show that neonatal mouse CD43<sup>-</sup> non-B-1 cells also produce substantial amounts of IL-10 following B cell antigen receptor (BCR) activation. In neonatal mouse CD43<sup>-</sup> non-B-1 cells, BCR engagement activated STAT5 under the control of phosphorylated forms of signaling molecules Syk, Btk, PKC, FAK, and Rac1. Neonatal STAT5 activation led to IL-6 production, which in turn was responsible for IL-10 production in an autocrine/paracrine fashion through the activation of STAT3. In addition to the increased IL-6 production in response to BCR stimulation, elevated expression of IL-6Rα expression in neonatal B cells rendered them highly susceptible to IL-6-mediated STAT3 phosphorylation and IL-10 production. Finally, IL-10 secreted from neonatal mouse CD43<sup>-</sup> non-B-1 cells was sufficient to inhibit TNF-α secretion by macrophages. Our results unveil a distinct mechanism of IL-6-dependent IL-10 production in BCR-stimulated neonatal CD19<sup>+</sup>CD43<sup>-</sup> B cells.</p></abstract><kwd-group kwd-group-type="author-keywords"><kwd>B cell</kwd><kwd>neonate</kwd><kwd>vaccine</kwd><kwd>cytokine</kwd><kwd>signaling</kwd></kwd-group><kwd-group kwd-group-type="research-organism"><title>Research organism</title><kwd>Mouse</kwd></kwd-group><funding-group><funding-statement>No external funding was received for this work.</funding-statement></funding-group><custom-meta-group><custom-meta specific-use="meta-only"><meta-name>Author impact statement</meta-name><meta-value>A novel B cell receptor induced interleukin 10 (IL-10) production from B10 cells involves signal transducer and activator of transcription 5 (STAT5) mediated IL-6 production which induces IL-10 in an autocrine and paracrine fashion from B10 cells.</meta-value></custom-meta></custom-meta-group></article-meta></front><body><sec id="s1" sec-type="intro"><title>Introduction</title><p>Infants and neonates demonstrate high susceptibility to infection, leading to 40% of the annual death of approximately 7 million children under the age of 5 years worldwide (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Bhutta and Black, 2013</xref>). Fetomaternal immune tolerance is essential to suppress rejection during pregnancy, and disruption of the fetomaternal tolerance can result in preterm labor (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Gomez-Lopez et al., 2014</xref>). During the perinatal period, newborns transition from their dependence on maternal immunity to their own immune system (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib76">Simon et al., 2015</xref>). Rapid exposure to environmental assaults, such as microbes, after birth renders neonates susceptible to infections (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib51">MacGillivray and Kollmann, 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib43">Kollmann et al., 2017</xref>). Although vaccination has been successful in curbing early age infection rates, infants are still vulnerable during to first year of life, especially because most pediatric vaccines need to be administered four times during the first 15 months of age in order to elicit adult like protective immunity against infections (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Ehreth, 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">Jacobson, 2020</xref>). The exact reasons for the suboptimal vaccine responses after birth are not sufficiently delineated and this knowledge gap is an obstacle in improving pediatric vaccines (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib43">Kollmann et al., 2017</xref>). The protective host response to most vaccines is initiated by the recognition of vaccine antigen via the B cell receptor (BCR) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Akkaya et al., 2020</xref>), followed by the generation of germinal center (GC) response that involve follicular helper T (Tfh) cells and GC B cells in secondary lymphoid organs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib86">Vinuesa et al., 2016</xref>). We and others have shown that the unique properties of impaired Tfh response contribute to the weak immune response to vaccines in neonatal mice (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib54">Mastelic et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib93">Yang et al., 2018</xref>). In addition, several types of immune suppressive cells contribute to fetomaternal immune tolerance and to human and murine neonatal suboptimal immunity via the potent anti-inflammatory cytokine interleukin (IL)–10 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib43">Kollmann et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Basha et al., 2014</xref>).</p><p>Initially described as a function of activated CD4<sup>+</sup> T helper (Th) 2 cells to inhibit cytokine production by Th1 cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Fiorentino et al., 1989</xref>), IL-10 has subsequently been shown to be produced by different cell types including dendritic cells, macrophages, neutrophils, mast cells, natural killer cells, T cells, and B cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib57">Moore et al., 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib63">Ouyang and O’Garra, 2019</xref>). The main activity of IL-10 is the inhibition of inflammatory responses (e.g., pro-inflammatory cytokine and chemokine synthesis, nitric oxide production, and antigen presentation) by both the innate and the adaptive immune cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib57">Moore et al., 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib63">Ouyang and O’Garra, 2019</xref>). IL-10 expression is controlled by various transcription factors including nuclear factor-κB (NF-κB), signal transducer and activator of transcription 3 (STAT3), and GATA binding protein 3 (GATA3) depending on the upstream signaling pathways and cell types (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib71">Saraiva and O’Garra, 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Hedrich and Bream, 2010</xref>). In human and neonatal B cells, IL-10 production has been shown to be mediated by a range of signaling, including BCR engagement (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Alhakeem et al., 2015</xref>), CD40 ligand (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Burdin et al., 1997</xref>), TLR agonists (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib45">Lampropoulou et al., 2008</xref>), IL-1β, IL-6 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib68">Rosser et al., 2014</xref>) and type I interferons (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib96">Zhang et al., 2007</xref>). In this study, we focused on the differences between adult and neonatal BCR induced IL-10 production to begin understanding the contribution of BCR mediated IL-10 production in weak vaccine responses in neonates.</p><p>B cells can be divided into two subsets: CD43<sup>+</sup> B-1 cells and CD43<sup>-</sup> non B-1 cells which include follicular B-2 cells, marginal zone B cells and IL-10 producing regulatory B cells (Bregs) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Baumgarth, 2011</xref>). B-1 cells are further subdivided into innate-like B-1a (CD5<sup>+</sup>) cells and B-1b (CD5<sup>-</sup>) cells. After emerging from the liver in the very early stage of life, B-1 cells have been suggested to be maintained by a ‘self-renewal’ process, whereas B-2 cells are continuously produced from progenitors in the bone marrow after birth in mice and humans (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Baumgarth, 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib56">Montecino-Rodriguez and Dorshkind, 2012</xref>). Accordingly, murine B-1 cells, which dominate the B cell population in neonatal spleen (30% of IgM<sup>+</sup> splenic B cells), are gradually exceeded by B-2 cells with age and account for approximately 2% in adult splenic B cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Hayakawa et al., 1983</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib55">Montecino-Rodriguez and Dorshkind, 2011</xref>). Among the B cells, B-1 cells are the main producers of IL-10 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib61">O’Garra et al., 1992</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib97">Zhang, 2013</xref>) and since B-1 cells account for 1/3 of neonatal mouse spleen, they are considered as the main source of IL-10 in neonatal spleen. Both mouse neonatal splenic and human cord blood Breg cells are shown to manifest suppressive activity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib97">Zhang, 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib72">Sarvaria et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Esteve-Solé et al., 2017</xref>).</p><p>Here, we demonstrated that there is a sizable neonatal mouse splenic CD19<sup>+</sup>CD43<sup>-</sup> non-B-1 cell population with potent IL-10 producing capacity in response to BCR stimulation. Upon BCR stimulation, neonatal CD19<sup>+</sup>CD43<sup>-</sup> cells, but not their adult counterparts, produced IL-6 downstream of activated STAT5. In an autocrine and paracrine fashion, the secreted IL-6 triggered the induction of IL-10 production from CD19<sup>+</sup>CD43<sup>-</sup> cells. Further, neonatal CD19<sup>+</sup>CD43<sup>-</sup> cells suppressed inflammatory cytokine production by macrophages in an IL-10-dependent manner.</p></sec><sec id="s2" sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><sec id="s2-1"><title>Neonatal spleen contains a CD43<sup>-</sup> cell population with substantial IL-10 production in response to BCR stimulation</title><p>The IL-10-producing splenic B cell population includes several different subsets characterized by surface markers (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib69">Rosser and Mauri, 2015</xref>). Among these subsets, the CD5<sup>+</sup> B-1 B cells comprise a small portion of adult spleen, but represent a higher percentage of neonatal splenic B cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Hayakawa et al., 1983</xref>). Accordingly, the higher representation of IL-10<sup>+</sup> B cells in neonatal spleen following a variety of stimuli is thought to be due to higher percentage of CD5<sup>+</sup> B-1 cells in neonatal spleen (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib81">Sun et al., 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib92">Yanaba et al., 2009</xref>). B-1 cells are identified by CD43 expression, and CD5 is used to distinguish between B-1a (CD43<sup>+</sup>CD5<sup>+</sup>) and B-1b (CD43<sup>+</sup>CD5<sup>-</sup>) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Baumgarth, 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Hardy, 2006</xref>). In this study, we sought to characterize the generation of neonatal IL-10-producing B cells following BCR stimulation as antigen recognition by B cells is essential for the activation of B cells in response to vaccines (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Akkaya et al., 2020</xref>). First, we purified CD19<sup>+</sup> cells from splenocytes (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1</xref>). Intracellular IL-10 staining confirmed the increased emergence of CD19<sup>+</sup>IL-10<sup>+</sup> B cells after stimulation of purified neonatal splenic B cells with anti-IgM antibodies compared to adult B cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1A</xref>). Also confirming previous reports (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Hayakawa et al., 1983</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib81">Sun et al., 2005</xref>), neonatal spleen contained higher percentage of CD43<sup>+</sup> B-1 cells than adult spleen (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s2">Figure 1—figure supplement 2A</xref> and B). Further gating of purified B cells based on CD43 expression indicated that neonatal CD43<sup>+</sup> cells contained higher percentage of CD19<sup>+</sup>IL-10<sup>+</sup> B cells than adult cells prior to BCR stimulation and there was a modest increase after BCR stimulation in both the age groups (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1B</xref>). Unlike the CD43<sup>+</sup> population, BCR stimulation induced a significant increase in IL-10<sup>+</sup> cells among the neonatal CD43<sup>-</sup> population, whereas IL-10<sup>+</sup> cells remained low in adult CD43<sup>-</sup> population after BCR-stimulation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1B</xref>). Thus, although neonatal splenic CD19<sup>+</sup>CD43<sup>+</sup> cells comprise the main IL-10<sup>+</sup> cells in neonatal spleen as reported previously, there is a substantial increase in IL-10<sup>+</sup> cell frequency and mean fluorescence intensity (MFI) among the CD19<sup>+</sup>CD43<sup>-</sup> population following antigen recognition (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1B</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s3">Figure 1—figure supplement 3</xref>). Since the CD19<sup>+</sup>CD43<sup>+</sup> cells have been well recognized as the IL-10-producing subset in neonatal spleen, we focused on the characterization of this newly defined IL-10-producing CD19<sup>+</sup>CD43<sup>-</sup> cell population in neonatal mice. We purified CD19<sup>+</sup>CD43<sup>-</sup> cells from splenocytes of adult and neonatal mice. There was no statistically significant difference in the CD43 MFI between adult and neonatal mice after the purification of CD19<sup>+</sup>CD43<sup>-</sup> cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s4">Figure 1—figure supplement 4A</xref> and B). Furthermore, there was no significant difference in the expression of <italic>spn</italic> gene coding for CD43 between purified adult and neonatal CD19<sup>+</sup>CD43<sup>-</sup> cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s4">Figure 1—figure supplement 4C</xref>). These results demonstrated that splenic B cells from the two age groups had comparable CD43 level after purification. Next, we measured secreted IL-10 in the culture media of purified CD19<sup>+</sup>CD43<sup>-</sup> cells after stimulating with anti-IgM antibodies. As observed in the flow cytometry analysis of gated CD19<sup>+</sup>CD43<sup>-</sup> cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1B</xref>), purified neonatal CD19<sup>+</sup>CD43<sup>-</sup> cells also produced higher IL-10 than the adult counterparts (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1C</xref>). The increase in IL-10 production reached statistical significance at 6-hr time point and remained high after peaking at 12 hr. IL-10 production by adult CD19<sup>+</sup>CD43<sup>-</sup> cells was minimal at all time points. <italic>Il10</italic> mRNA measurement indicated that adult CD19<sup>+</sup>CD43<sup>-</sup> cells manifested a rapid and sharp increase in <italic>Il10</italic> expression which was quickly shut off within 6 hr post-stimulation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1D</xref>), and this temporal gene expression appeared to be insufficient for IL-10 protein synthesis (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1C</xref>). An initial sharp increase of <italic>Il10</italic> expression was also observed in neonatal CD19<sup>+</sup>CD43<sup>-</sup> cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1D</xref>). Unlike in adult cells, neonatal <italic>Il10</italic> expression further increased at later time points, facilitating the production of IL-10 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1C</xref>). These results indicate that, unlike its adult counterparts, neonatal splenic CD19<sup>+</sup>CD43<sup>-</sup> cells have the propensity to produce IL-10 after BCR cross-linking.</p><fig-group><fig id="fig1" position="float"><label>Figure 1.</label><caption><title>BCR-induced IL-10 production in adult and neonatal splenic B cell subsets.</title><p>(<bold>A and B</bold>) Splenic B cells were isolated from adult and neonatal mice.

To test this hypothesis, we investigated whether the STAT5 inhibitor Pimozide would block STAT3 phosphorylation. Supporting this hypothesis and suggesting that STAT5 functions as an upstream mediator of STAT3, Pimozide suppressed neonatal BCR-induced STAT3 phosphorylation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3D</xref>). Next, we sought to elucidate how STAT5 activates STAT3 in a JAK-dependent fashion. As JAKs are activated by cytokine receptors and several studies proposed autocrine IL-6 signaling in tumor cell lines (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">Kawashima et al., 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib94">Yeh et al., 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Gao et al., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Hartman et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib66">Rodriguez-Barrueco et al., 2015</xref>), we envisaged an autocrine activity of IL-6 produced by BCR-stimulated neonatal CD19<sup>+</sup>CD43<sup>-</sup> B cells. Indeed, we found significantly higher <italic>Il6</italic> mRNA expression and IL-6 protein production following BCR cross-linking in neonatal CD19<sup>+</sup>CD43<sup>-</sup> B cells compared to those in adult counterparts (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3E, F</xref>). Higher IL-6 production in neonatal B cells following BCR cross-linking was also observed by flow cytometry (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s1">Figure 3—figure supplement 1C</xref>). While BCR-mediated signaling alone is not sufficient to induce IL-6 in adult B cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib41">Kenny et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Arkatkar et al., 2017</xref>), studies in macrophages and cell lines have shown that STAT5 can contribute to IL-6 promoter activity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">Kawashima et al., 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib42">Kimura et al., 2005</xref>). To test whether the IL-6 production by neonatal B cells was also governed by STAT5 activation, we stimulated cells in the presence of the STAT5 inhibitor, Pimozide. Indeed, Pimozide abrogated both <italic>Il6</italic> mRNA expression and IL-6 protein production following BCR engagement, whereas the pan-JAK inhibitor Pyridone 6 did not (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3G, H</xref>). This result was reproduced by using small interfering RNA targeting STAT5, which also suppressed BCR-induced IL-6 production (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3I</xref>). These findings indicated that STAT5 has an essential role in the production of IL-6 by BCR-activated neonatal CD19<sup>+</sup>CD43<sup>-</sup> cells.</p><p>Next, we sought to investigate whether the STAT3 phosphorylation in BCR-activated neonatal cells was due to the IL-6 secreted from CD19<sup>+</sup>CD43<sup>-</sup> cells. IL-6 signaling is mediated by membrane-bound or soluble IL-6 receptor alpha (IL-6Rα) and a transmembrane protein gp130 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib79">Su et al., 2017</xref>). Only after forming a complex with IL-6, the IL-6Rα associates with gp130 and transduces signals for JAK-STAT3 pathway (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib82">Taga et al., 1989</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib58">Murakami et al., 1993</xref>). Suggesting a role for IL-6 in STAT3 activation, blockade of IL-6 signaling with anti-IL-6Rα monoclonal antibody (15A7) reduced neonatal BCR-induced STAT3 phosphorylation, but not STAT5 phosphorylation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4A</xref>). Similarly, the gp130 inhibitor SC144 abrogated STAT3 phosphorylation following BCR engagement (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s1">Figure 4—figure supplement 1</xref>). While the blocking experiments indicated that IL-6 produced in response to BCR-engagement was responsible for STAT3 activation, STAT3 is also activated by IL-10 signaling (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib73">Shouval et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s2">Figure 4—figure supplement 2A</xref>). Since BCR stimulation also induces IL-10 production in neonatal B cells, we tested the involvement of IL-10 in STAT3 phosphorylation by using anti-IL-10R blocking monoclonal antibody. We found that anti-IL-10R antibody did not reduce neonatal BCR-induced STAT3 phosphorylation while anti-IL-6Rα antibody did (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s2">Figure 4—figure supplement 2B</xref>). These results suggest that neonatal CD19<sup>+</sup>CD43<sup>-</sup> cells produced IL-6 following BCR cross-linking in a STAT5-dependent manner, and subsequently the secreted IL-6 activated STAT3 via the IL-6R-gp130 pathway in an autocrine/paracrine fashion.</p><fig-group><fig id="fig4" position="float"><label>Figure 4.</label><caption><title>Autocrine IL-6 activates IL-10 expression in a STAT3-dependent manner.</title><p>In all experiments, splenic CD19<sup>+</sup>CD43<sup>-</sup> B cells were isolated and stimulated with 10 μg/mL F(ab’)<sub>2</sub> fragments of anti-IgM antibodies to engage BCR under different conditions.

To begin addressing this question, we first investigated whether the production of IL-10 was dependent on IL-6 signaling in CD19<sup>+</sup>CD43<sup>-</sup> cells. We found that blocking with antibodies against IL-6Rα, but not with anti-IL-10R, totally abrogated <italic>Il10</italic> mRNA expression 7 hr after BCR stimulation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4B</xref>). To further elucidate this question, we evaluated responses in splenic CD19<sup>+</sup>CD43<sup>-</sup> B cells from IL-6-deficient neonatal mice. We began by assessing the activation of STATs in IL-6 knock out (KO) neonatal splenic CD19<sup>+</sup>CD43<sup>-</sup> cells. Further underscoring the dependency of BCR-induced STAT3 activation on IL-6 production, BCR cross-linking did not induce STAT3 phosphorylation in CD19<sup>+</sup>CD43<sup>-</sup> cells from IL-6 KO neonatal mice, whereas STAT5 phosphorylation was comparable between wild-type and IL-6 KO strains (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4C</xref>). We excluded the possibility of a defect in STAT3 activation in IL-6-deficient CD19<sup>+</sup>CD43<sup>-</sup> cells because recombinant IL-6 induced the phosphorylation of STAT3 in IL-6 KO neonatal CD19<sup>+</sup>CD43<sup>-</sup> cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s2">Figure 4—figure supplement 2C</xref>).</p><p>Next, we assessed the cytokine levels in IL-6-deficient neonatal B cells following BCR engagement. Both <italic>Il10</italic> gene expression and IL-10 protein levels were significantly reduced in IL-6 KO neonatal CD19<sup>+</sup>CD43<sup>-</sup> cells compared to wild-type counterparts (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4</xref>, D and E). IL-6 deficiency did not create an overall suppressive state because both <italic>Tnf</italic> gene expression and TNF-α protein levels were comparable between wild-type and IL-6-deficient neonatal CD19<sup>+</sup>CD43<sup>-</sup> cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4</xref>, D and E). Notably, despite the significant reduction in IL-10 levels, there were residual gene and protein expression in CD19<sup>+</sup>CD43<sup>-</sup> cells from IL-6 KO mice. To test whether other cytokines also contribute to IL-10 production, we focused on IL-1β because IL-1β is shown to enhance IL-10 production by CD40-activated B cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib68">Rosser et al., 2014</xref>). While neonatal CD19<sup>+</sup>CD43<sup>-</sup> cells significantly increased <italic>Il1b</italic> gene expression following BCR cross-linking (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s3">Figure 4—figure supplement 3A</xref>), blocking IL-1β signaling using a neutralizing antibody failed to reduce IL-10 production by IL-6-deficient neonatal CD19<sup>+</sup>CD43<sup>-</sup> B cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s3">Figure 4—figure supplement 3B, C</xref>). In addition, biologically active recombinant IL-1β (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s3">Figure 4—figure supplement 3D</xref>) did not induce IL-10 while recombinant IL-6 did (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s3">Figure 4—figure supplement 3E</xref>). The IL-12 family member cytokine IL-35 has been shown to induce Breg differentiation and IL-10 production (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib90">Wang et al., 2014</xref>). The autocrine effect of IL-35 on IL-10 production by Bregs has been considered since this cytokine is secreted by Bregs as well as Tregs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">Huang et al., 2017</xref>). To assess whether IL-35 may be involved in IL-10 secretion, we measured IL-35 production from anti-IgM stimulated neonatal B cells. Ruling out its involvement, IL-35 production was not observed following BCR cross-linking (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s4">Figure 4—figure supplement 4</xref>). These results suggested that molecule(s) other than IL-1β and IL-35 are likely responsible for the production of residual IL-10 from BCR-stimulated IL-6 KO neonatal CD19<sup>+</sup>CD43<sup>-</sup> cells.</p><p>In addition to the elevated IL-6 production, flow cytometry assessment revealed that neonatal B cells expressed modest but significantly higher levels of surface IL-6Rα compared to their adult counterpart (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5A</xref>). Measurement of <italic>il6ra</italic> expression in B cells from both age groups also showed that neonatal cells expressed higher <italic>il6ra</italic> but this difference did not reach statistical significance (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5s1">Figure 5—figure supplement 1</xref>).

We next sought to determine whether neonatal BCR-induced autocrine IL-6 signaling has a role in the IL-10-dependent regulatory function of neonatal CD19<sup>+</sup>CD43<sup>-</sup> cells. To this end, conditioned media (CM) were prepared from BCR-stimulated splenic CD19<sup>+</sup>CD43<sup>-</sup> cells isolated from adult, wild-type neonatal (WT), and IL-6 KO neonatal mice and the inhibitory potential of the CM from each condition was tested by measuring TNF-α production from adult mouse peritoneal macrophages (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7s1">Figure 7—figure supplement 1</xref>). We confirmed that CM from WT neonatal CD19<sup>+</sup>CD43<sup>-</sup> cells contained the highest amount of IL-10 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7A</xref>), whereas all three CMs contained low amount of TNF-α (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7B</xref>).

In sharp contrast, CM from anti-IgM-stimulated wild-type neonatal cells triggered a blunted TNF-α production from macrophages. To test whether the low TNF-α secretion with CM from wild-type neonate was due to elevated IL-10 in the CM, we included blocking antibodies against IL-10R in the culture system. Suggesting a suppressive role for the elevated IL-10 levels in the CM from wild-type neonatal CD19<sup>+</sup>CD43<sup>-</sup> cells, IL-10R antibodies significantly increased the TNF-α production and restored its concentration to macrophages incubated with neonatal IL-6 KO CM. Since adult and IL-6 KO CM contained low IL-10 levels, addition of anti-IL-10R antibodies did not significantly alter the TNF-α production in macrophages incubated with these CMs. Thus, these results demonstrate a major role for autocrine IL-6 signaling in the suppressive effect of BCR-induced IL-10 from neonatal CD19<sup>+</sup>CD43<sup>-</sup> B cells on macrophage inflammatory cytokine production.</p><fig-group><fig id="fig7" position="float"><label>Figure 7.</label><caption><title>IL-10 secreted from neonatal CD19<sup>+</sup>CD43 B cells suppress TNF-α secretion from macrophages.</title><p>(<bold>A and B</bold>) Isolated splenic CD19<sup>+</sup>CD43<sup>-</sup> B cells were stimulated with 10 μg/mL F(ab’)<sub>2</sub> fragments of anti-IgM antibodies for 24 hr.

Although neonatal B10 cells were reported previously by Yanaba and colleagues, the production of IL-10 from these cells in response to anti-IgM stimulation has not been studied (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib92">Yanaba et al., 2009</xref>). Our data show that neonatal CD19<sup>+</sup>CD43<sup>-</sup> B cells are highly sensitive to BCR stimulation, but the secretion of IL-10 depends on the production of IL-6 from these cells rather than directly linking BCR to the transcription of <italic>Il10</italic> (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7s2">Figure 7—figure supplement 2</xref>). In contrast to CD19<sup>+</sup>CD43<sup>-</sup> B cells, B-1 cells secrete IL-10 spontaneously and the secretion of IL-10 is further increased following BCR-stimulation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Alhakeem et al., 2015</xref>). The BCR-mediated IL-10 production from B-1 cells depends on p38 MAPK activity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Alhakeem et al., 2015</xref>). The absence of IL-10 production directly after BCR stimulation in neonatal CD19<sup>+</sup>CD43<sup>-</sup> B cells in our experiments is not unlikely to be due to the absence of p38 MAPK activity in these cells, because adult CD19<sup>+</sup>CD43<sup>-</sup> B cells also failed to secrete IL-10 despite the phosphorylation of Akt, p38, JNK and ERK in response to BCR engagement. We found that the rapid IL-6 secretion following BCR engagement requires STAT5 activation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7s2">Figure 7—figure supplement 2</xref>). We also demonstrated that neonatal SH2 binding site (Tyr<sup>397</sup>) on FAK was constitutively phosphorylated, and this phosphorylation was required for STAT5 phosphorylation because the FAK inhibitor, F-14 which inhibits phosphorylation at Tyr<sup>397</sup> effectively blocked BCR-induced STAT5 phosphorylation. These results indicated that FAK scaffold functions were essential to mediate BCR signaling to STAT5 in neonatal B cells as has been shown for FLT3 receptor signaling in oncogenic cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Chatterjee et al., 2014</xref>). A member of Rho family of GTPases, Rac1 has been shown to have a role in STAT5 activation in several types of cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Benitah et al., 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib40">Kawashima et al., 2006</xref>) and Rac1 functions as a downstream effector of FAK (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Chatterjee et al., 2014</xref>). Using specific inhibitors, we determined that Rac1, Syk, Btk, and PKC controlled neonatal BCR-induced STAT5 activation. Taken together, our data unveiled the signaling pathway mediated by Syk, Btk, PKC, FAK, and Rac1 in the activation of STAT5 and the production of IL-6 in BCR stimulated neonatal CD19<sup>+</sup>CD43<sup>-</sup> B cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7s2">Figure 7—figure supplement 2</xref>).</p><p>Induction of IL-10 secretion from Breg cells by IL-6 has been shown previously by Rosser and colleagues in adult mice (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib68">Rosser et al., 2014</xref>). However, in this study the authors have discovered that IL-6, as well as IL-1β, produced by macrophages in response to microbiota mediated stimuli act on splenic and lymph node Breg cells to produce IL-10. An important distinction between our findings in neonatal CD19<sup>+</sup>CD43<sup>-</sup> B cells and those of Rosser and colleagues in adult Breg cells is that whereas microbiota-derived IL-6 and IL-1β required simultaneous CD40 signaling to induce IL-10 production from adult Breg cells, IL-6 alone was able to stimulate the production of IL-10 from neonatal CD19<sup>+</sup>CD43<sup>-</sup> B cells. The independence of neonatal CD19<sup>+</sup>CD43<sup>-</sup> B cells from CD40 signaling in IL-6-induced IL-10 secretion has in vivo relevance because neonatal B cells do not get activated through CD40 due to weak CD40L expression in neonatal T cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Durandy et al., 1995</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Fuleihan et al., 1994</xref>). As was observed by Rosser and colleagues (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib68">Rosser et al., 2014</xref>), we also found that recombinant IL-6 was not able to induce IL-10 production from adult CD19<sup>+</sup>CD43<sup>-</sup> B cells. We think that the heightened sensitivity of neonatal B cells to IL-6 is likely multifactorial. We found modestly elevated expression of IL-6R on neonatal CD19<sup>+</sup>CD43<sup>-</sup> B cells compared to adult cells. In addition to higher IL-6R expression, there may be additional enhancers downstream of neonatal IL-6R that may help in increased STAT3 phosphorylation and IL-10 production. Higher IL-6 production by neonatal B cells following BCR engagement may have implications other than suppression through increased IL-10 secretion. The beneficial effect of IL-6 in the generation of adult T follicular helper (Tfh) cells, which help activate germinal center B cells to differentiate into plasma cells and memory B cells in response to immunization and infection is well recognized (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib44">Korn and Hiltensperger, 2021</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib64">Papillion et al., 2019</xref>). We have previously shown that, in contrast to adults, IL-6 suppresses vaccine response in neonatal mice by inhibiting Tfh generation and expanding the suppressive T follicular regulatory helper (Tfr) cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib93">Yang et al., 2018</xref>). Thus, in addition to stimulating IL-10 production, increased IL-6 secretion from BCR-stimulated neonatal B cells may be blunting Tfh generation.</p><p>The IL-10 produced by neonatal BCR-stimulated CD19<sup>+</sup>CD43<sup>-</sup> B cells was functional because it inhibited TNF-α production by macrophages. We demonstrated that CM from anti-IgM-stimulated neonatal and adult B cells produced molecules that induced TNF-α production by macrophages, but this induction was blunted with the IL-10 in neonatal CM because the inhibitory anti-IL-10R antibody effectively restored the TNF-α secretion from macrophages. Moreover, there was no inhibition of TNF-α production from macrophages when CM from IL-6 KO B cells were used. In summary, our study revealed a detailed molecular and cellular mechanism involved in BCR-mediated IL-10 production by neonatal CD19<sup>+</sup>CD43<sup>-</sup> B cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7s2">Figure 7—figure supplement 2</xref>). The lower threshold of producing IL-10 in response to BCR stimulation is likely amplified by the fact that neonatal CD19<sup>+</sup>CD43<sup>-</sup> B cells express higher levels of IgM than their adult counterparts. One possible biological reason for the elevated production of the suppressive cytokine IL-10 could be to dampen the inflammatory response when newborns encounter massive amounts of microbial stimuli after birth. This unique inhibitory pathway involving intermediate IL-6 secretion expands our understanding of the overall weak responses of neonates to vaccines and their susceptibility to infections.</p></sec><sec id="s4" sec-type="materials|methods"><title>Materials and methods</title><sec id="s4-1"><title>Mice</title><p>C57BL/6 J mice and IL-6 KO (B6.129S2-<italic>Il6<sup>tm1Kopf</sup></italic>/J) mice were purchased from The Jackson Laboratory and maintained in local facilities.

cell-derived IL-10 following anti-BCR stimulation than adult mice. This is due to a autocrine mechanisms where by anti-BCR stimulation leads to pSTAT5 up regulation, production of IL-6 which then enhances IL-10 production via pSTAT3. These are interesting results for the regulatory B cell field, demonstrating that signaling is different in adult vs neonatal B cells and in particular for researchers studying the mechanisms underpinning the enhanced susceptibility to infection.</p></body></sub-article><sub-article article-type="decision-letter" id="sa1"><front-stub><article-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.83561.sa1</article-id><title-group><article-title>Decision letter</article-title></title-group><contrib-group content-type="section"><contrib contrib-type="editor"><name><surname>Kurosaki</surname><given-names>Tomohiro</given-names></name><role>Reviewing Editor</role><aff><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="ror">https://ror.org/035t8zc32</institution-id><institution>Osaka University</institution></institution-wrap><country>Japan</country></aff></contrib></contrib-group><contrib-group><contrib contrib-type="reviewer"><name><surname>Rosser</surname><given-names>Lizzy</given-names></name><role>Reviewer</role><aff><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="ror">https://ror.org/02jx3x895</institution-id><institution>University College London</institution></institution-wrap><country>United Kingdom</country></aff></contrib><contrib contrib-type="reviewer"><name><surname>Yasuda</surname><given-names>Tomoharu</given-names></name><role>Reviewer</role><aff><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="ror">https://ror.org/03t78wx29</institution-id><institution>Hiroshima University</institution></institution-wrap><country>Japan</country></aff></contrib></contrib-group></front-stub><body><boxed-text id="sa2-box1"><p>Our editorial process produces two outputs: (i) <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://sciety.org/articles/activity/10.1101/2022.09.18.508441">public reviews</ext-link> designed to be posted alongside <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://www.biorxiv.org/content/10.1101/2022.09.18.508441v1">the preprint</ext-link> for the benefit of readers; (ii) feedback on the manuscript for the authors, including requests for revisions, shown below. We also include an acceptance summary that explains what the editors found interesting or important about the work.</p></boxed-text><p><bold>Decision letter after peer review:</bold></p><p>Thank you for submitting your article &quot;B cell receptor induced IL-10 production from neonatal CD19<sup>+</sup>CD43-cells depends on STAT5 mediated IL-6 secretion&quot; for consideration by <italic>eLife</italic>. Your article has been reviewed by 2 peer reviewers, including Tomoharu Yasuda as Reviewing Editor and Reviewer #2, and the evaluation has been overseen by Betty Diamond as the Senior Editor. The following individual involved in the review of your submission has agreed to reveal their identity: Lizzy Rosser (Reviewer #1).</p><p>The reviewers have discussed their reviews with one another, and the Reviewing Editor has drafted this to help you prepare a revised submission.</p><p>Essential revisions:</p><p>Experimentally,</p><p>1) Characterization of the neonatal CD43-negative B cell population has not been carefully performed. It should be useful if authors show the expression of surface markers for B10, B1, and B2 cells such as CD1d, CD5, B220, CD21, CD23, and CD93.</p><p>2) Figure 1B: Because CD43 is one of the activation markers for B cells, CD43 levels could be changed in the course of stimulation. Therefore, the authors should stimulate and analyze IL-10 levels in B cells after the separation of CD19<sup>+</sup>CD43- and CD19<sup>+</sup>CD43+ fractions.</p><p>3) It is not convincing whether the MACS-depleted CD43 negative B cell fraction used for entire experiments contains only CD43-negative B cells or includes CD43-low B cells. If the CD43 expression level is similar to adult splenic B2 cells, it is not the matter. But if it contains CD43low cells, authors should describe them as CD43-/low cells rather than CD43- cells. This point may be addressed by comparing RNAseq data used in Figure 2A or MFI comparison between fractions from adults and neonates.</p><p>4) Mature splenic B cells in adult mice downregulate IgM while upregulating IgD. Different IgM expression levels in neonatal CD19<sup>+</sup>CD43+ B cells and adult CD19<sup>+</sup>CD43+ B cells could explain the different reactivity to BCR crosslinking. FACS analysis of IgM/IgD levels in those cells will be important to interpret the data.</p><p>5) IL10 staining is marginal and not convincing. The addition of brefeldin/monensin in combination with BCR stimulation should be tried if the authors have not done yet.</p><p>6) According to reviewer #1's suggestions, the text should be carefully edited; particularly, in the introduction and discussion, the authors should fairly refer to other peoples' data for non-expert readers to easily understand.</p><p><italic>Reviewer #1 (Recommendations for the authors):</italic></p><p>Suggestions for the authors:</p><p>Introduction:</p><p>1 – Please refer to CD43- as B-2 cells not non B-1 cells.</p><p>2 – CD5<sup>+</sup>CD1dhi B cells are usually referred to as B10 cells, whilst regulatory B cells refer to all IL-10-producing B cells.</p><p>3 – Multiple cytokines further to IL-1b and IL-6 have now been shown to induce IL-10 production by B cells, most notably IFN. This is important as previous research for context has been type 1 interferon protects neonatal from acute inflammation via induction of IL-10-producing B cells (Zhang et al. 2007, JEM).</p><p>4 – The authors should be clear in the introduction about what sites they are talking about (i.e. the spleen) and when data is referencing human or murine studies.</p><p>Results:</p><p>1 – It would be good to have more explanation about the use of anti-BCR stimulation in vitro alone rather than the addition of other agents such as anti-CD40 in combination or TLR agonists. These agents are more well known to stimulate IL-10 production rather than solo stimulation with anti-BCR.</p><p>2 – In figure 1, the seems to be only a marginal shift to suggest positive IL-10 staining. It is unclear from the methods whether the authors added brefeldin/monensin prior to staining intracellular antigens. Is there a rationale for using Fix/Perm intra-nuclear fixation buffer rather than a cytoplasmic fixation buffer?</p><p>3 – Figure 2 supplementary data (especially the number of DEGs) should be in the main figure, could the authors improve the presentation of the pathway data?</p><p>4 – I thought that the work using different inhibitors to assess differences in pathway activation between adults and neonates was well executed.</p><p>5 – Figure 5 – The IL-6ra staining is not that convincing, perhaps a matched PCR for the gene would be useful?

An interesting IL-10-producing mechanism was proposed based on solid and ample data. However, the neonatal CD43- B cell subset secreting IL-10 has not been well characterized and carefully analyzed. Thomas Tedder's group previously identified the CD19<sup>+</sup>IL-10+ B cell population in neonates by showing beautiful intracellular IL-10 staining. Those cells were CD1dlowCD5<sup>+</sup> phenotype but may not be documented CD43 expression levels while adult B10 cells were divided in CD43+ and CD43- fractions.

We now performed additional flow cytometry experiments to analyze IL-10 producer CD43-negative B cells described in the literature. We showed that the frequencies of T2-Marginal zone precursor cells, MZP (CD19<sup>+</sup>CD21<sup>hi</sup>CD23<sup>hi</sup>CD24<sup>hi</sup>) and marginal zone B cells, MZB (CD19<sup>+</sup>CD21<sup>hi</sup>CD23<sup>-</sup>) were significantly lower in neonates than adults. Tim-1 B cell population was comparable between the age groups (Figure 1—figure supplement 7). In contrast to these CD43-negative subsets, there was significantly higher frequency of CD5<sup>+</sup>CD1d<sup>+</sup> as well as CD5<sup>+</sup>CD1d<sup>hi</sup> populations in neonates than the adults and these populations produced the highest levels of IL-10 (Figure 1E and Figure 1—figure supplement 8A).</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>2) Figure 1B: Because CD43 is one of the activation markers for B cells, CD43 levels could be changed in the course of stimulation. Therefore, the authors should stimulate and analyze IL-10 levels in B cells after the separation of CD19<sup>+</sup>CD43- and CD19<sup>+</sup>CD43+ fractions.</p></disp-quote><p>We are in agreement with the editor/reviewer that the analysis of CD43 levels after stimulation is critical since we are focusing on CD43-negative cells following the stimulation of cells. However, when we tried to obtain CD19<sup>+</sup>CD43- and CD19<sup>+</sup>CD43+ fractions separately by the 2-step magnetic bead isolations using Pan mouse B Cell Isolation kit (130-095-813, Miltenyi), and the mouse CD43 (Ly-48) Microbeads (130049-801, Miltenyi) kit, we were not able to get pure CD43- and CD43+ populations from neonatal spleen. The Pan B Cells Isolation Kit appears to be optimized for adult splenocytes because it successfully removed non-B cells from adult spleen, but it failed to deplete non-B cells from neonatal spleen. CD43 microbeads however, worked well for both adult and neonatal cells. We also attempted to isolate cells by flow cytometry but found out that sorted neonatal cells became blunted and did not respond to stimulation after sorting. Thus, we were not able to identify an appropriate method to obtain separate fractions of CD19<sup>+</sup>CD43- and CD19<sup>+</sup>CD43+ cells from neonatal splenocytes.</p><p>As an alternative to separation of CD19<sup>+</sup>CD43- and CD19<sup>+</sup>CD43+ fractions, we now measured changes in CD43 expression before and after stimulation. We found that before stimulation adult CD19<sup>+</sup> population contained very small population of CD43+ cells which were approximately 1/5<sup>th</sup> of the neonatal CD43+ cells (Figure 1—figure supplement 6). There was an increase in the CD43+ population in both the age groups after stimulation. To assess whether the changes in CD43 expression had an impact on the IL-10 producing CD43-negative population, we subjected the CD43-negative population to different stringency of gating and measured IL-10<sup>+</sup> cells among the CD43negative populations. We found that neonatal IL-10 producing CD43-negative population increased with more stringent gating of CD43<sup>-</sup> cells after stimulation while adult CD43<sup>-</sup>IL-10<sup>+</sup> population did not change (Figure 1—figure supplement 6). These results rule out the possible impact of BCR-induced changes in CD43 expression in IL10 production from CD43- population.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>3) It is not convincing whether the MACS-depleted CD43 negative B cell fraction used for entire experiments contains only CD43-negative B cells or includes CD43-low B cells.

We now measured the CD43 MFI and CD43 gene (<italic>spn</italic>) expression in isolated CD19<sup>+</sup>CD43- population as suggested.

We found no difference in CD19<sup>+</sup>IgM<sup>+</sup> frequency between the age groups (Figure 1—figure supplement 5A). However, when we analyzed the subsets, we measured significantly higher frequency and MFI of IgM<sup>hi</sup> cells among neonatal CD19<sup>+</sup>CD43<sup>-</sup> population compared to those of adult cells. There was no difference in the IgM expression among the CD19<sup>+</sup>CD43<sup>+</sup> population between the age groups. In contrast, both neonatal CD19<sup>+</sup>CD43<sup>-</sup> cells and CD43<sup>+</sup> B-1 cells exhibited lower frequency and MFI of IgD<sup>hi</sup> cells compared to their adult counterparts (Figure 1figure supplement 5B). These results suggest that higher expression of IgM among the CD19<sup>+</sup>CD43<sup>-</sup> cells may be responsible for the enhanced STAT5 phosphorylation and IL6 production in anti-IgM stimulated neonatal cells.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>5) IL10 staining is marginal and not convincing. The addition of brefeldin/monensin in combination with BCR stimulation should be tried if the authors have not done yet.</p></disp-quote><p>We agree that IL-10 staining is marginal and brefeldin/monensin can, in general, help in capturing intracellular cytokine production. However, we were not able to use brefeldin/monensin during the culturing of the cells because these reagents also block the secretion of IL-6, which is required for the expression and secretion of IL-10 in neonatal cells. Nevertheless, our ELISA and q-PCR data complement the flow cytometry results to show that IL-10 is indeed produced more from CD43-negative neonatal B cells compared to adult cells and this outcome is dependent on initial IL-6 production following BCR engagement.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>6) According to reviewer #1's suggestions, the text should be carefully edited; particularly, in the introduction and discussion, the authors should fairly refer to other peoples' data for non-expert readers to easily understand.</p></disp-quote><p>We have now expanded the introduction section to include the type I IFN reference the reviewer indicated (Reference 22). Also, we clarified the reasons to focus on BCR stimulation induced IL-10 production as it is relevant to vaccine responses. We also included additional clarifications in our Discussion section to provide insight into enhanced sensitivity of neonatal cells to BCR induced IL-10 production.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Reviewer #1 (Recommendations for the authors):</p><p>Suggestions for the authors:</p><p>Introduction:</p><p>1 – Please refer to CD43- as B-2 cells not non B-1 cells.</p></disp-quote><p>We thank the reviewer for the suggestion to refer the CD43- as B-2 cells and not non-B-1 cells. We chose to refer this population as non-B-1 cells because CD43- cells include</p><p>B-2 cells as well as marginal zone B cells and Breg cells according to Nicole Baumgarth (reference 16 in the first version and reference 23 in the current version). Therefore, we respectfully prefer to keep the “non B-1 cell” definition.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>2 – CD5<sup>+</sup>CD1dhi B cells are usually referred to as B10 cells, whilst regulatory B cells refer to all IL-10-producing B cells.</p></disp-quote><p>We thank the reviewer for pointing out this distinction. We now changed the text to replace “CD5<sup>+</sup>CD1d<sup>hi</sup> B cells” with “IL-10-producing regulatory B cells” in line 82. Please also note that we now included data showing that the main IL-10 producing neonatal CD19-CD43- population is the B10 cells (CD5<sup>+</sup>CD1d<sup>hi</sup>) (Figure 1F).</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>3 – Multiple cytokines further to IL-1b and IL-6 have now been shown to induce IL-10 production by B cells, most notably IFN.

We now included this study in the introduction section (line 76).</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>4 – The authors should be clear in the introduction about what sites they are talking about (i.e. the spleen) and when data is referencing human or murine studies.</p></disp-quote><p>We thank the reviewer for drawing our attention to clarifying the sites and the species we refer to in the introduction. We now updated the introduction to include this information.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Results:</p><p>1 – It would be good to have more explanation about the use of anti-BCR stimulation in vitro alone rather than the addition of other agents such as anti-CD40 in combination or TLR agonists. These agents are more well known to stimulate IL-10 production rather than solo stimulation with anti-BCR.</p></disp-quote><p>We would like to point out that the main reason we studied the responses of B cells to BCR stimulation is because our main focus is to provide insight into possible mechanisms of weak neonatal immune response to vaccines. Since antigen recognition is an early and crucial step in the initiation of vaccine responses, we used anti-IgM to engage BCR. We now clarified this point in the introduction section (First paragraph of Introduction. Line 53).</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>2 – In figure 1, the seems to be only a marginal shift to suggest positive IL-10 staining.

And the error bar is very wide, so higher numbers would be informative.</p></disp-quote><p>Although the difference in the frequency of IL-6Ra expressing CD43- cells is statistically significantly higher in neonates vs adults, we agree with the reviewer that the IL-6Ra levels are modest. We now performed q-PCR to measure the expression levels of adult and neonatal IL-6Ra gene. Neonatal cells expressed higher levels of <italic>il6ra</italic> but this difference was not statistically significant. We included this data to Results section (Figure 5-supp figure 1). Nevertheless, we clearly see a difference in p-STAT3 levels as well as the production of IL-10 in response to IL-6 stimulation between adult and neonatal cells. Based on the modest difference between adult and neonatal IL-6Ra expression, we now updated the Discussion section (paragraph 3) to indicate that additional factors downstream of IL-6Ra may contribute to the differences in IL-6 responses between adults and neonates.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>6 – Why do the authors think that IL-6 does not induce IL-10 from B-1 cells? Is this due to differences in pSTA5/pSTAT3 signalling downstream of B-1 versus B-2 BCR?</p></disp-quote><p>We thank the reviewer for this relevant question. At this point we do not know why B-2 cells do not secrete IL-10 in response to IL-6. We also do not know if B-2 cells signal in response to IL-6. It is even possible that B-2 cells do not express IL-6R. We will examine these possibilities as a continuation of our current study.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>7 – Is the signaling cascade downstream of IL-6R signaling also different in neonatal versus adult B cells?</p></disp-quote><p>So far, we have only measured STAT3 phosphorylation in response to IL-6 between adult and neonatal CD19<sup>+</sup>CD43- cells (Figure 5B). We showed that adult cell p-STAT3 levels also increase in response to IL-6, although this increase is less and delayed compared to the increase in neonatal cells. Our comparison of IL-6Ra expression levels partially explains this difference because the neonatal IL-6Ra are moderately higher than the levels on adult cells. There are likely other differences downstream of IL-6Ra, which need to be investigated further.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Discussion:</p><p>1 – Why do the authors think that neonatal B cells show heightened BCR activation compared to adult B cells?

We also think that the elevated production of IL-10 in response to IgM stimulation may be needed to dampen the microbial inflammatory response as a result of the rapid encounter with microbes after birth. We now included this viewpoint in the last paragraph of Discussion section.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>2 – How do the authors integrate their data with other studies showing different signals (e.g. IFN) that control the up-regulation of IL-10 by neonatal B cells?</p></disp-quote><p>We have ruled out the contribution of IL-1b in the production of IL-10 from CD19<sup>+</sup>CD43<sup>-</sup></p><p>B cells but we did not specifically investigate the role for type I IFNs in BCR induced IL10 secretion. We believe that type I IFNs are unlikely to contribute to IL-10 secretion from CD19<sup>+</sup>CD43<sup>-</sup> B cells because our anti-IL-6 blocking antibody experiments together with the IL-6 KO mouse B cell experiments clearly show that IL-10 production from antiIgM stimulated neonatal CD19<sup>+</sup>CD43<sup>-</sup> B cells is mostly dependent on IL-6.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Additional comments:</p><p>1 – What is the sex of the neonatal donor cells used?
