competent HML-2 proviruses have been identified in humans. HML-2-related proviruses are present in other primates, including rhesus macaques, but the extent and timing of HML-2 activity in macaques remains unclear. We have identified 145 HML-2-like proviruses in rhesus macaques, including a clade of young, rhesus-specific insertions. Age estimates, intact open reading frames, and insertional polymorphism of these insertions are consistent with recent or ongoing infectious activity in macaques. 106 of the proviruses form a clade characterized by an ~750 bp sequence between <italic>env</italic> and the 3′ long terminal repeat (LTR), derived from an ancient recombination with a HERV-K(HML-8)-related virus. This clade is found in Old World monkeys (OWM), but not great apes, suggesting it originated after the ape/OWM split. We identified similar proviruses in white-cheeked gibbons; the gibbon insertions cluster within the OWM recombinant clade, suggesting interspecies transmission from OWM to gibbons. The LTRs of the youngest proviruses have deletions in U3, which disrupt the Rec Response Element (RcRE), required for nuclear export of unspliced viral RNA. We show that the HML-8-derived region functions as a Rec-independent constitutive transport element (CTE), indicating the ancestral Rec–RcRE export system was replaced by a CTE mechanism.</p></abstract><abstract abstract-type="plain-language-summary"><title>eLife digest</title><p>Just as we study fossils to understand how animals and plants have evolved, we can study ancient viruses to understand how diseases have emerged and changed over long periods. Unlike fossils, viruses do not leave visible traces in the ground but, instead, they leave viral genes known as endogenous viral elements (or EVEs) that become permanently incorporated in their host’s DNA.</p><p>HML-2s are the youngest known EVEs in the human genome. They have evolved gradually by accumulating lots of small genetic changes and no longer actively infect humans. But these virus remnants have long been suspected to play a role in prostate cancer, lupus and other human diseases. Rhesus macaques and other monkeys also have HML-2s but these are less well studied than human HML-2s. Monkeys are often used as models of human biology in research studies, therefore, understanding how HML-2s have evolved in rhesus macaques may enable researchers to establish this monkey as a model for investigating the role of HML-2s in humans.</p><p>To investigate this possibility, Williams et al. searched for HML-like EVEs in rhesus macaque genomes published in previous studies. The experiments found that, unlike human HML-2s, the macaque HML-2s underwent a sudden genetic transformation millions of years ago. They acquired a new gene from another virus that completely changed how the macaque HML-2s leave a compartment within the cells of their host that contains most of the host’s genome – a key step in the life cycle of viruses.</p><p>The data also suggest that HML-2s may still be actively infecting macaques today and that these EVEs jumped from monkeys into gibbons. This is the first known example of HML-2s moving between different types of primates and it indicates there may be a risk that macaque HML-2s could infect humans.</p><p>In the future, the findings of Williams et al. may help researchers develop new approaches to treat prostate cancer and other diseases linked with HML-2s in humans.</p></abstract><kwd-group kwd-group-type="author-keywords"><kwd>endogenous retrovirus</kwd><kwd>viral evolution</kwd><kwd>RNA export</kwd><kwd>zoonosis</kwd><kwd>recombination</kwd></kwd-group><kwd-group kwd-group-type="research-organism"><title>Research organism</title><kwd>Human</kwd><kwd>Rhesus macaque</kwd><kwd>Viruses</kwd></kwd-group><funding-group><award-group id="fund1"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000060</institution-id><institution>National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>AI083118</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Williams</surname><given-names>Zachary H</given-names></name><name><surname>Imedio</surname><given-names>Alvaro Dafonte</given-names></name><name><surname>Lee</surname><given-names>Derek C</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund2"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000060</institution-id><institution>National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>AI136074</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Williams</surname><given-names>Zachary H</given-names></name><name><surname>Imedio</surname><given-names>Alvaro Dafonte</given-names></name><name><surname>Lee</surname><given-names>Derek C</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund3"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000054</institution-id><institution>National Cancer Institute</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>R35CA200421</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Williams</surname><given-names>Zachary H</given-names></name><name><surname>Gaucherand</surname><given-names>Lea</given-names></name><name><surname>Mostafa</surname><given-names>Salwa Mohd</given-names></name><name><surname>Phelan</surname><given-names>James P</given-names></name><name><surname>Coffin</surname><given-names>John M</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund4"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100005303</institution-id><institution>Boston College</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Johnson</surname><given-names>Welkin E</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><funding-statement>The funders had no role in study design, data collection, and interpretation, or the decision to submit the work for publication.</funding-statement></funding-group><custom-meta-group><custom-meta specific-use="meta-only"><meta-name>Author impact statement</meta-name><meta-value>The genetic 'fossil record' of a retroviral lineage over &gt;25 million years of evolution reveals the profound consequences of an ancient recombination event on viral replication mechanisms and genome structure, and identifies an ancient interspecies viral transmission.</meta-value></custom-meta></custom-meta-group></article-meta></front><body><sec id="s1" sec-type="intro"><title>Introduction</title><p>Retroviruses (<italic>Retroviridae</italic>) are a major family of animal viruses, including human viruses capable of causing severe immunodeficiency (HIV-1 and HIV-2) or cancer (HTLV-1) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Chermann et al., 1983</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Gallo et al., 1984</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Guyader et al., 1987</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">Jern and Coffin, 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib62">Poiesz et al., 1980</xref>). Uniquely among animal viruses, they must irreversibly integrate their genome into the host genome in order to replicate (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Brown, 1997</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Hughes et al., 1978</xref>). If an infected cell survives, the integrated viral genome, or provirus, will be stably inherited by daughter cells; if a germline cell is infected, the provirus may be inherited by an offspring of the host organism as a heterozygous allele, which may eventually become fixed in the descendant population (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib75">Stoye, 2012</xref>). Such proviruses and remnants of such proviruses, known as endogenous retroviruses (ERVs), form a major fraction of most eukaryotic genomes; in humans, ~8% of the genome is composed of such sequences (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Griffiths, 2001</xref>). These sequences serve as a useful ‘fossil record’ of past viral infections, and can also play important roles in genome evolution, host–viral interactions, and disease; in some animals, such as mice and cats, reactivation and recombination of ERVs with exogenous viruses and/or other ERVs can have severe pathogenic consequences (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Bamunusinghe et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Bolin and Levy, 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">Johnson, 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib85">Young et al., 2012</xref>). No replication competent human ERV (HERV) has been identified; however, the betaretrovirus-like HERV-K group contains one subgroup, human MMTV-like-2, or HML-2 (named for its similarity to mouse mammary tumor virus (MMTV)), which includes many proviruses with full-length open reading frames (ORFs) and other intact functional elements, including two proviruses with full-length ORFs for the four core retroviral proteins Gag, Pro, Pol, and Env (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Boller et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Hanke et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib76">Subramanian et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib82">Wildschutte et al., 2016</xref>). The majority of HML-2 proviruses containing full-length ORFs are within the LTR5Hs subclade, which is the youngest HERV clade and contains many human specific and insertionally polymorphic proviruses that have not yet reached fixation in human populations (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib76">Subramanian et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib82">Wildschutte et al., 2016</xref>). Although none of these proviruses are replication competent, two groups have shown that a synthetic consensus young HML-2 provirus is weakly replication competent, and expression of HML-2 RNA and proteins has been observed in a number of different diseases (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Dewannieux et al., 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Garcia-Montojo et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Goering et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Hanke et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib53">Magiorkinis et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib70">Schmitt et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib79">Wang-Johanning et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib43">Lee and Bieniasz, 2007</xref>).</p><p>The oldest known human HML-2 proviruses have orthologous insertions in both apes and Old World monkeys (OWM), indicating that the clade originated in the common ancestor of the catarrhine primates (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Bannert and Kurth, 2006</xref>). However, much less is known about the evolutionary history and extent of HML-2 activity in non-human primates than in humans. A recent study reported that HML-2 has more recently been actively replicating in gorillas than in humans, though it is still unclear whether that activity has continued to the present day; some chimpanzee-specific insertions have also been identified, although fewer than in humans or gorillas (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Holloway et al., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib50">Macfarlane and Badge, 2015</xref>). A 2007 study identified 19 HML-2 proviruses in rhesus macaques (designated as ‘RhERV-K’), including three with almost identical long terminal repeats (LTRs), implying relatively recent integration (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib68">Romano et al., 2007</xref>). More recently, another study identified several HML-2-like proviruses in rhesus macaques, detected expression of <italic>env</italic> mRNA, and identified one macaque with an Env-specific immune response (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib83">Wu et al., 2016</xref>). One of the proviruses identified, which the authors named SERV-K1, has full-length ORFs for <italic>gag</italic> and <italic>env</italic>, and only two single nucleotide insertions disrupting the <italic>pro</italic> and <italic>pol</italic> ORFs. SERV-K1 is not present in the rhesus reference genome, indicating that it is insertionally polymorphic, and its 5′ and 3′ LTRs are identical in sequence. Both of these characteristics indicate that SERV-K1 is a relatively young insertion (less than about 500,000 years old), and suggests that rhesus macaques could possibly harbor currently or recently active HML-2-like retroviruses. Lastly, a recent study identified SERV-K1-like proviruses in a number of OWM species, including multiple macaque species, geladas, and olive baboons; this study also reported that many of these proviruses had very similar LTRs, suggestive of recent integration (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib78">van der Kuyl, 2021</xref>). Overall, these studies indicate the potential for recent HML-2 activity in multiple catarrhine primate species, including rhesus macaques. Thus, a comprehensive characterization of HML-2 proviruses in the rhesus macaque reference genome would provide a valuable starting point for further investigations of this potential. In order to investigate the possibility that HML-2 viruses were recently or are currently active in rhesus macaques, we searched for HML-2 proviral sequences in the two most recent rhesus genome assemblies and performed an in-depth characterization of their structure, coding capacity, and evolutionary history, with a particular focus on SERV-K1-like proviruses. We have found that SERV-K1 is part of a large clade of rhesus proviruses that show signs of recent activity. Furthermore, this clade originated as an ancient recombinant between an HML-2-like virus and another retrovirus in the HERVK11(HML-8) clade. The recombinant retrovirus has also undergone at least one interspecies transmission event, from OWM to gibbons. Lastly, we have discovered that the region derived from the recombination with HML-8 functions as a novel constitutive RNA transport element, capable of facilitating export of unspliced and partially spliced viral RNA from the nucleus.</p></sec><sec id="s2" sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><sec id="s2-1"><title>Structural comparison of SERV-K1 and human HML-2</title><p>SERV-K1 is closely related to human HML-2, with Gag, Pro, Pol, and Env having 79, 90, 90, and 82% amino acid identity to the proteins of the consensus human HML-2 provirus HERV-Kcon (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib43">Lee and Bieniasz, 2007</xref>), respectively; however, we also noticed some major structural differences (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1A</xref>). The LTRs are significantly reduced in length, 588 bp compared to HERV-Kcon’s 968 bp, with large deletions relative to human HML-2 in the U3 region (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1C</xref>). Also, while the majority of SERV-K1 <italic>env</italic> is highly similar to human HML-2 <italic>env</italic>, ~90% identical at the amino acid level, the final 92 residues, including the transmembrane alpha helix and cytoplasmic tail, are divergent, with only 34% amino acid identity (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1B</xref>). This divergent region of <italic>env</italic> is similar to the <italic>env</italic> genes of another ERV group, HERVK11 HML-8 (a betaretrovirus-like ERV group distantly related to HERV-K HML-2) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Andersson et al., 1999</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">de Parseval et al., 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib54">Mayer, 2013</xref>). Lastly, directly downstream of <italic>env</italic> there is a 726-bp region that is not homologous to any sequence in human HML-2, and that has no obvious protein coding capacity. This region (in addition to the last 25 bp of the <italic>env</italic> ORF) appears to be derived from an HML-8 LTR, with approximately 85% nucleotide identity to MER11A elements in the human genome. MER11A is a subtype of HERVK11 HML-8 LTRs, which are classified as MER11 elements in the RepBase database of repetitive elements (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib41">Kojima, 2018</xref>). This relationship suggests that the ~1000 bp region comprising the last ~275 bp of <italic>env</italic> and 726 bp of adjacent non-coding sequence was derived by recombination between an HML-2-related retrovirus and an HML-8-like retrovirus (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1B</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1</xref>).</p><fig-group><fig id="fig1" position="float"><label>Figure 1.</label><caption><title>Structural features of rhesus macaque HML-2 proviruses.</title><p>(<bold>A</bold>) Overall structure of selected rhesus proviruses compared to consensus human-specific HML-2.

This initial search produced many hits with &gt;95% identity to SERV-K1, all of which shared the same non-coding region in between <italic>env</italic> and the 3′ LTR as SERV-K1, as well as many hits with lower identity, without the non-coding region. These non-coding sequences are typically annotated by RepeatMasker as MER11 elements, specifically MER11A, although some are annotated as LTR5B elements, for reasons that are unclear to us (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib71">Smit et al., 2015</xref>). As a second method of identifying HML-2 proviruses, we retrieved all sequences from rheMac10 that are annotated by RepeatMasker as HERV-K internal sequence, LTRs, or MER11A, and merged adjacent annotated elements together to generate putative full proviral insertions. After filtering out solo LTRs, non-HML-2 insertions, and fragments under 2 kb, we identified 140 full-length and partial HML-2 proviruses in the rheMac10 reference genome, including 100 SERV-K1-like proviruses.</p><p>Since the rheMac8 assembly sequenced a different animal from rheMac10, we used the same methods to mine the rheMac8 genome and found 5 additional proviruses, all containing MER11 elements, for a total of 145 full-length and partial HML-2 proviruses, including 105 SERV-K1-like proviruses (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="fig1sdata1 fig1sdata2">Figure 1—source data 1 and 2</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib87">Zimin et al., 2014</xref>). Four additional loci were excluded as gaps were present within the assembled proviral sequences and we were not confident of proper assembly. We have assigned each proviral locus a unique identifier based on the chromosome number, leftmost coordinate of the insertion, and which genome assembly it was first identified in, for example 16-60303645_RM10 is a provirus first found in the rheMac10 assembly at chr16:60,303,645. SERV-K1 is not present in either rheMac8 or rheMac10, so we have not assigned it a new identifier, although we know that it is inserted on chromosome 12 at chr12:88,113,733. There are thus a total of 106 SERV-K1-like proviruses (including SERV-K1 itself) that are included in the following analyses.</p></sec><sec id="s2-3"><title>Structural features of macaque proviruses</title><sec id="s2-3-1"><title>Open reading frames</title><p>We searched each provirus for the presence of full-length ORFs (defining a full-length ORF as at least 90% complete as compared to the ORFs of SERV-K1), and identified 40 proviruses with at least one full-length ORF, with a total of 31 <italic>gag</italic>, 17 <italic>pro</italic>, 6 <italic>pol</italic>, and 7 <italic>env</italic> ORFs (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1A</xref>). No full-length ORFs were identified in non-recombinant proviruses. We did not identify any proviruses with ORFs for all four genes, however we did identify five proviruses with three intact ORFs; notably, three of these proviruses, 4-119635325_RM10, 18-38612209_RM8, and X-3424152_RM10 have intact <italic>gag</italic>, <italic>pro</italic>, and <italic>pol</italic>, and thus could potentially produce functional Gag-Pro-Pol polyproteins.

The HML-8 group is also known as HERVK11 in the RepBase database, with the LTRs annotated as MER11 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib41">Kojima, 2018</xref>). This region begins in the TM (transmembrane) subunit of <italic>env</italic>, in a stretch of ~35 nucleotides with relatively high nucleotide identity between HML-2 <italic>env</italic> and HML-8 <italic>env</italic> (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1</xref>). It then continues for approximately 1000 bp, including the transmembrane alpha helix and cytoplasmic tail of <italic>env</italic> TM and a 750-bp partial HML-8 LTR, annotated by RepeatMasker as a MER11A element, with the last 25 bp of <italic>env</italic> overlapping with the first 25 bp of the MER11 element. In the oldest provirus identified, the MER11 element is ~100 bp longer due to sequences deleted in the younger proviruses. The MER11 element is followed by a region of non-coding sequence derived from the ancestral HML-2 <italic>env</italic> TM. In the oldest proviruses this region is approximately 240 bp, and includes almost the entire sequence of the ancestral <italic>env</italic> that was replaced by HML-8 <italic>env</italic>; in younger proviruses most of this region has been deleted, leaving only a 42-bp sequence primarily comprising the retroviral polypurine tract (PPT), which is required for second strand synthesis during reverse transcription (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1B</xref>). A 21-bp sequence composed entirely of purine nucleotides is immediately upstream of the MER11 element, and presumably is derived from the HML-8 PPT; it is unclear whether this sequence functions as a second PPT in the recombinant virus. The HML-8 region appears to be derived from a recombination between an HML-2 and HML-8 virus, probably between co-packaged HML-2 and HML-8 RNAs during reverse transcription.</p><p>A potential mechanism for this recombination is shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1</xref>, with an initial template switch after the first strand transfer, from the HML-2 RNA in Env TM region to the HML-8 RNA in R or U3, potentially aided by microhomology. RT continues to copy the HML-8 RNA template until it reaches the HML-8 Env region, where it crosses back to HML-8 Env in a highly conserved portion of TM with ~35 bp of relatively high similarity nucleotide sequence between HML-2 and HML-8 Env. Reverse transcription continues with no further crossovers between HML-2 and HML-8. Both crossovers take place within 15–50 bp of each other on HML-2 template, resulting in an ~1100 bp insertion, including ~275 bp of Env TM and an ~850 bp partial HML-8 LTR, comprising U3 and possibly R. Thus, the initial recombinant included almost the entire nucleotide sequence of the HML-2 parental virus, with ~1100 bp of additional sequence derived from HML-8. We have tentatively named the clade of HML-2-related viruses that are descended from this initial recombinant virus SERV-K/MER11.</p></sec><sec id="s2-3-3"><title>Internal deletions</title><p>Although we identified many full-length or nearly full-length proviruses, a major fraction of the SERV-K/MER11 proviruses have large internal deletions (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1A</xref>).

These deletions are found in many other SERV-K/MER11 proviruses, but not all; some proviruses have no large deletions, and have similar length LTRs to human HML-2s, others only have the Δ2 deletion, and a few proviruses have another, ~250 bp deletion distinct from the other two deletions, but overlapping them in U3 (Δ3).</p></sec></sec><sec id="s2-4"><title>Evolutionary history of SERV-K/MER11 in OWM</title><p>To better understand the evolutionary history of HML-2 in macaques, we generated maximum likelihood trees using <italic>pol</italic>, <italic>env</italic>, and LTR sequences for all the proviruses identified. As previously mentioned, a large number of proviruses had deletions in <italic>pol</italic>, <italic>env</italic>, or both, and thus are not included in those trees. In all trees, the recombinant SERV-K/MER11 proviruses formed a well-supported monophyletic clade distinct from non-recombinant rhesus proviruses (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figures 2</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">3</xref>). Proviruses from the two major human HML-2 clades, LTR5Hs and LTR5A, were included for comparison in the <italic>pol</italic> and <italic>env</italic> trees, as well as MMTV as an outgroup. In both trees the LTR5Hs clade contained the nearest human HML-2 relatives to SERV-K/MER11. Many of the SERV-K/MER11 proviruses in the LTR phylogeny have very little divergence between their 5′ and 3′ LTRs; in many cases the LTRs are identical, suggestive of relatively recent integration times (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3A</xref>). There are two distinct clades of low divergence proviruses, which we have labeled as clades 1 and 2. Notably, all of the low divergence proviruses are in the SERV-K/MER11 group; clade 1 contains the highest number of young proviruses, including SERV-K1 and other proviruses with multiple intact ORFs. We mapped the presence or absence of each LTR deletion as described in the previous section on the LTR tree; the most basal proviruses all have full length, ~1 kb LTRs, indicating that the original recombinant had intact LTRs similar in length to human HML-2s. The Δ3 and Δ2 deletions arise first, with the Δ1 deletion only showing up in the youngest, least divergent sequences; interestingly, Δ1 appears in both clades 1 and 2, despite not being present in the older members of either clade or the common ancestor of the two clades, suggesting that either Δ1 occurred twice, or entered one or both lineages through recombination.</p><fig id="fig2" position="float"><label>Figure 2.</label><caption><title>Phylogeny of SERV-K/MER11 <italic>pol</italic> and <italic>env.</italic></title><p>Maximum likelihood phylogenies for SERV-K/MER11 <italic>pol</italic> (<bold>A</bold>) and <italic>env</italic> (<bold>B</bold>) with 1000 bootstrap replicates.

We estimate that the oldest SERV-K/MER11 provirus identified, 5-85732019_RM10, integrated ~25 million years ago. Consistent with this age, orthologous proviral insertions are present in the genomes of both cercopithecine and colobine OWM species, indicating that it integrated in a common ancestor of OWMs, prior to the cercopithecine-colobine split, between 9 and 26 million years ago (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Finstermeier et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib64">Pozzi et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib74">Springer et al., 2012</xref>).</p><p>As younger proviral insertions are likely to be insertionally polymorphic, we screened 23 of the rhesus SERV-K/MER11 proviruses for insertional polymorphism in a panel of 14 rhesus macaque genomic DNA samples using 3 primer allele-specific polymerase chain reaction (PCR) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib82">Wildschutte et al., 2016</xref>) with insertion specific flanking primers and a primer specific to the SERV-K/MER11 5′ UTR to amplify the proviral allele and/or the pre-integration empty site; two crab-eating macaque (<italic>Macaca fascicularis</italic>) samples were also screened (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s1">Figure 3—figure supplement 1</xref>). 6/23 were determined to be insertionally polymorphic in rhesus macaques, with at least one individual heterozygous or homozygous for the empty site allele (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s1">Figure 3—figure supplement 1</xref>).

We noticed that all but one of them also overlap with the Rec Response Element (RcRE), a 433 nucleotide structured RNA element within the U3 region of human HML-2 that binds Rec, an HML-2 accessory protein that is necessary for nuclear export of unspliced and partially spliced viral mRNAs (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5C</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib49">Löwer et al., 1995</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib52">Magin-Lachmann et al., 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib51">Magin et al., 1999</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib84">Yang et al., 1999</xref>). As this RNA export process is essential for viral replication, and it seemed likely that these deletions would abrogate or abolish RcRE function, we wondered whether SERV-K/MER11 proviruses have evolved a new or altered mechanism for unspliced RNA transport. Specifically, we wondered whether the HML-8 LTR-derived MER11 region might play a role in this transport, either replacing the original RcRE, or functioning as a constitutive transport element (CTE) that does not require a viral accessory protein to function. CTEs provide the RNA transport mechanism used by Mason-Pfizer monkey virus (MPMV), avian leukosis virus, and some other simple retroviruses (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Bray et al., 1994</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib57">Ogert et al., 1996</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib60">Pessel-Vivares et al., 2015</xref>).</p><p>We first asked whether SERV-K/MER11 proviruses still make a <italic>rec</italic>-like transcript. HML-2 Rec is translated from a doubly spliced RNA; the first coding exon is derived from the Env signal peptide, and the second coding exon begins near the C-terminus of Env, in an alternate reading frame (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6A</xref>). The region containing this exon has been replaced in SERV-K/MER11 by HML-8-derived sequence; as this region is only ~50% identical to HML-2 at the nucleotide level, we were unsure whether the <italic>rec</italic> splice form would be preserved, or make a functional protein. As HERV-K HML-2 is known to be expressed in human embryonic stem cells and induced pluripotent stem cells (iPSCs) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Fuchs et al., 2013</xref>), we aligned a publically available rhesus macaque iPSC RNAseq dataset (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Fang et al., 2014</xref>) to the SERV-K1 proviral genome using HISAT2 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib40">Kim et al., 2019</xref>), and looked for reads crossing splice junctions of <italic>rec</italic> or other alternatively spliced RNAs using the Integrative Genomics Viewer (IGV) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib67">Robinson et al., 2011</xref>).

This transcript is predicted to make a 149 aa protein, with the first 87 residues derived from the ancestral Rec protein, and the other 62 residues encoded by HML-8-derived sequence (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6</xref>). The HML-2-derived exon of this Rec-like protein, which we have called sRec, is ~80% identical at the amino acid level to HML-2 Rec; the HML-8-derived exon, in contrast, is much longer than the HML-2 Rec second exon, 62 aa compared to 18 aa, and has only 28% aa identity in the first 18 residues (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6B</xref>).</p><fig-group><fig id="fig6" position="float"><label>Figure 6.</label><caption><title>SERV-K/MER11 chimeric <italic>rec</italic>-like transcript and Rec response element deletions.</title><p>(<bold>A</bold>) Comparison of human HML-2 <italic>rec</italic> transcript to SERV-K/MER11 <italic>sRec</italic> transcript.

This led us to hypothesize that the MER11 region contains an RcRE-like element that has replaced the ancestral RcRE, that binds the sRec protein. To test this hypothesis, and the alternate hypothesis that the MER11 region contains a CTE, we adapted a dual color lentiviral reporter system designed to measure the ability of both <italic>cis</italic> and <italic>trans</italic> factors to promote nuclear export of unspliced RNAs that has been previously shown to work with the HML-2 Rec/RcRE system as well as CTEs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">Jackson et al., 2019</xref>). This system consists of a modified NL4-3 HIV provirus that expresses eGFP from an unspliced transcript, and mCherry from a fully spliced transcript; eGFP will thus only be expressed if unspliced transcripts are exported from the nucleus (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7A</xref>). HIV uses an accessory protein, Rev, that binds to the Rev Response Element (RRE) in unspliced and partially spliced HIV transcripts to facilitate RNA nuclear export. The reporter vector does not express Rev, and the RRE is flanked by restriction cut sites. Thus, Rev/RRE-like systems such as the HML-2 Rec/RcRE system can be tested by replacing the RRE with an RNA element of interest, and supplying the cognate viral accessory protein in trans by co-transfecting an expression vector, along with the reporter vector. CTEs can also be tested with this system, but do not require co-transfection of an accessory gene.</p><fig-group><fig id="fig7" position="float"><label>Figure 7.</label><caption><title>Constitutive transport element (CTE) activity of HERVK11 HML-8-derived region in SERV-K/MER11.</title><p>(<bold>A</bold>) Schematics of dual color lentiviral reporter and transport elements tested.

As in Jackson et al., unspliced RNA transport activity was quantified as the ratio of eGFP mean fluorescent intensity (MFI), the transport element-dependent signal, to mCherry MFI, the transport element-independent signal. We found that all three SERV-K/MER11 constructs showed strong RNA transport activity, both with and without sRec (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7B, C</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7s1">Figure 7—figure supplement 1</xref>).

The highest eGFP/mCherry ratio was seen with the full-length MER11U3R construct, approximately 2-fold higher than the MER11 construct, which had a signal approximately 15-fold higher than MER11-Δenv. Although it shows far less RNA transport activity than the other two SERV-K/MER11 constructs, the MER11-Δenv construct has eight times higher activity than the background signal seen with RcRE in the absence of Rec, and also higher activity than the MPMV CTE positive control.</p><p>We next wanted to test the ability of the MER11-derived region to promote unspliced RNA export in the context of viral replication; to do this, we chose to use MPMV, the source of the first CTE identified, and by far the most well-studied CTE mechanism (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Bray et al., 1994</xref>). We modified a GFP-tagged MPMV proviral construct by either deleting the MPMV wild-type CTE (wtCTE) or replacing the CTE with the MER11 element from pNL4-3(eGFP)(MER11)(mCherry). Importantly, all other functional elements were left intact in all constructs, including the MPMV PPT directly downstream of the CTE (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8">Figure 8A</xref>). These modified constructs along with the parental construct, which all express eGFP in place of Env, were transfected into HEK293T cells along with a vesicular stomatitis virus glycoprotein G (VSV-G) expression vector to create VSV-G pseudotyped viral stocks. All three constructs showed strong eGFP expression in the producer cells, as expected since eGFP is expressed from the spliced <italic>env</italic> transcript which should express constitutively (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8s1">Figure 8—figure supplement 1</xref>). The viral supernatants were used to infect HEK293T target cells. Infectivity was visualized by fluorescent imaging of infected cells, and quantified by measuring the percentage of eGFP expressing cells using flow cytometry (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8">Figure 8B, C</xref>). As expected, MPMV with the wtCTE showed strong VSV-G-dependent infectivity, and deleting the wtCTE nearly completely abolished infectivity, despite equal or higher eGFP expression in producer cells. Replacing the wtCTE with a MER11 element restored infectivity to ~70% of wild-type levels. Thus, the SERV-K/MER11 HML-8-derived region is a bona fide CTE capable of functionally replacing the MPMV CTE during viral replication.</p><fig-group><fig id="fig8" position="float"><label>Figure 8.</label><caption><title>MER11 constitutive transport element (CTE) can functionally replace the MPMV CTE in the context of a single round vesicular stomatitis virus glycoprotein G (VSV-G) pseudotyped viral infection.</title><p>(<bold>A</bold>) MPMV proviral constructs expressing eGFP in place of Env, with either the wild-type MPMV CTE (wtCTE), no CTE (ΔCTE), or the MER11 CTE replacing wtCTE (MER11), were transfected into HEK293T cells with and without VSV-G.

Consistent with this estimate, orthologs of the oldest insertions are found in species from both subfamilies of OWM, but not in any apes. This timing is supported by estimated integration times of these ancient elements based on sequence divergence of their 5′ and 3′ LTRs. The majority of the 106 recombinant proviruses so far identified in rhesus genomes are much younger, however, including two subclades of rhesus-specific insertions. Many of these young proviruses are insertionally polymorphic and present at low frequencies in macaques, and 36 of them have identical LTRs. Taken together, this evidence suggests infectious activity of HERV-K-like retroviruses in rhesus macaques within the last 500–250,000 years, and the potential for ongoing replication.</p><p>We investigated the coding capacity of these proviruses, and identified full-length ORFs for all genes, including 28 <italic>gag</italic>, 13 <italic>pro</italic>, 6 <italic>pol</italic>, and 7 <italic>env</italic> ORFs; two proviruses have intact ORFs for the full <italic>gag-pro-pol</italic> region and could thus potentially make functional retroviral cores, although they are lacking <italic>env</italic>, and so could not make infectious virus without complementation in trans from a provirus encoding a functional <italic>env</italic> gene. We compared the sequence of the consensus recent SERV-K/MER11 to HERV-Kcon; the overall nucleotide sequence identity of the coding region is 89.2% and amino acid identity of Gag, Pro, Pol, and Env are 78.5, 91, 91, and 82.5%, respectively. Although the sequence of these viruses has diverged, as expected for RNA viruses that have evolved separately for over 20 million years, it is likely that many of the basic features of HML-2 biology are conserved between these two viruses.</p><p>Although many of the proviruses characterized have one or more full-length ORFs, the majority of the proviruses also contain large shared deletions in the coding regions. The deletion containing proviruses are presumably not replication competent, and are reminiscent of human Type 1 HML-2s (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib48">Löwer et al., 1993</xref>), which contain a 292-bp <italic>env</italic> deletion, and other shared deletions observed in gorilla HML-2s (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Holloway et al., 2019</xref>). Like those deletions, they are likely propagated via co-packaging with replication competent viral genomes.</p><p>In contrast to the coding regions, the LTRs of SERV-K/MER11 have undergone major structural changes, with large deletions in the U3 region. These deletions have accumulated over millions of years, with unique deletions appearing in the viral lineages in different host species, all converging on the same region of U3. Strikingly, the majority of these deletions overlap with the RcRE in human HML-2; it seems plausible that the accumulation of these RcRE deletions is causally related to the ancient recombination with HML-8 which provided the MER11 element of SERV-K/MER11. We have demonstrated that the MER11 element in a consensus young SERV-K/MER11 provirus is capable of functioning as a Rec-independent CTE, thus explaining how these proviruses are capable of functioning without an RcRE. Of the four most well-characterized betaretroviral systems (MMTV, Jaagsiekte sheep retrovirus, MPMV, and HERV-K HML-2), only one, MPMV, has a CTE system. MPMV was isolated from a rhesus macaque, and is the prototype isolate of the simian retroviruses (SRVs) of Asian macaques. Interestingly, the SRV clade is, like SERV-K/MER11, recombinant, with an <italic>env</italic> gene more closely related to those of gammaretroviruses than betaretroviruses (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib73">Sonigo et al., 1986</xref>); this raises the possibility that the SRV CTE system is also derived from a recombination event involving <italic>env</italic> and an adjacent non-coding sequence (the CTE).</p><p>Although these viruses appear to have lost their RcRE, they have retained a <italic>rec-</italic>like transcript that is predicted to produce a chimeric Rec-like protein, with a second exon derived from the recombinant HML-8-like sequence. This sRec protein does not appear to promote unspliced RNA transport, either with the human HML-2 RcRE or with SERV-K/MER11 sequences, but the conservation of this splice form suggests it may have another function in viral replication. This function may have evolved since the recombination event, or alternatively it may be that the Rec protein of human HML-2 has a second, currently unknown function. We cannot completely rule out the possibility that sRec still has some unspliced RNA transport activity, but the RcRE deletions and presence of an Rec-independent CTE in the MER11 element in combination with the lack of any promotion of unspliced RNA transport in our experiments by an sRec plasmid suggests any such activity is likely minimal. It is also as yet unknown whether the original chimeric sRec formed by the recombination event retained RNA transport activity, or whether that activity was lost over time. An immediate loss of RNA transport activity could provide a simple explanation for why these viruses switched from using a Rec–RcRE system to a CTE, if the original recombinant HML-8-derived region already had CTE activity. However, other evolutionary scenarios remain plausible, and the hypotheses that the ancestral recombinant sRec did not have RNA transport activity and that the ancestral MER11 element had CTE activity remain unproven.</p><p>The multiple deletions in U3 centered on the RcRE region indicate that the acquisition of the MER11 CTE resulted in relaxed constraint on this region. Whether these deletions are the result of neutral evolution or were in some way adaptive is unclear, however it is worth noting that four separate lineages in three species seem to have independently acquired such deletions, which seems at least suggestive of adaptive evolution. Potential selective forces include altered U3 promoter activity (which could potentially alter viral tropism), escape from sequence-specific restriction factors such as KRAB ZNFs, or perhaps some maladaptive effect of having both a CTE and RcRE in the same virus. It is also possible that lengthening the viral genome by ~1 kb had deleterious effects on viral fitness (e.g. constraints on the maximum length of RNA that can be efficiently packaged by the capsid), and the deletions relieved this defect. In this context, it is interesting to note that SERV-K1 is only 117 bp longer than HERV-Kcon, and thus the total length of the post-recombination deletions almost matches the length of the HML-8-derived insertion.</p><p>We have tested three different MER11 constructs for CTE activity. The largest one is composed of the HML-8-derived region of <italic>env</italic>, the MER11 element derived from the HML-8 LTR, the PPT, and the predicted U3R region of the SERV-K/MER11 LTR; from this we made two smaller constructs, one containing the full HML-8-derived sequence, without the PPT or U3R, and one containing only the LTR-derived MER11 region. All three constructs had CTE activity, however the construct containing only the LTR-derived MER11 region had noticeably lower activity as measured by the ratio of GFP to mCherry fluorescence, which may indicate that a portion of the <italic>env</italic> coding region is required for full CTE function. The MER11U3R construct has somewhat higher apparent activity than the MER11-only construct, however this appears to be driven by lower mCherry expression rather than higher eGFP expression, and may be an artifact resulting from placing U3R (which contains the SERV-K/MER11 polyadenylation signal) upstream of mCherry.</p><p>It is as yet unknown whether the full MER11 element is required for CTE function, although it is notable that few deletions of the MER11 region have appeared in the SERV-K/MER11 lineage since the original recombination, which would seem to suggest that the full MER11 is necessary for viral replication, whether or not it is all part of the CTE. Interestingly, the HML-2 <italic>env</italic>-derived sequence in between the MER11 element and the 3′ LTR is ~240 bp long in the oldest SERV-K/MER11 proviruses, but has been reduced to a short remnant containing the PPT in the rhesus-specific clade, as one might predict since it no longer has a function as part of the <italic>env</italic> ORF.</p><p>The full MER11-derived region is much longer than the canonical MPMV CTE, ~1000 bp as compared to 162 bp, and longer than most other previously characterized CTE-like elements as well. However, there are other examples of CTE-like elements much longer than the MPMV CTE; the MusD transport element (MTE) is 412 bp long (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib66">Ribet et al., 2007</xref>), and the murine leukemia virus (MLV) post-transcriptional regulatory element (PTE) is over 1400 bp long (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib61">Pilkington et al., 2014</xref>), while the woodchuck hepatitis virus (WHV) post-transcriptional regulatory element or WPRE (known to enhance both export and translation of RNAs) is 592 bp long (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Donello et al., 1998</xref>). We were not able to identify any regions in MER11 with clear sequence homology to these elements or any other published RNA export element, nor are there obvious functional motifs (e.g. the NXF1-binding loops in the MPMV CTE). However, it is predicted to have strong secondary structure (data not shown), with a complex series of stem loops extending over the entire sequence. In comparison, the MusD MTE, MLV PTE, and WHV WPRE all also have complex, multi-stem loop secondary structures (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Donello et al., 1998</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib44">Legiewicz et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib61">Pilkington et al., 2014</xref>).</p><p>The above experiments are all in the context of a lentiviral reporter construct, which do not normally use a CTE, and the assay tests the ability of the element to promote viral gene expression, but does not directly test its ability to promote viral replication. Similar reporters have also previously been shown to be somewhat ‘leaky’, which could possibly lead to increased GFP expression via increased translation of low levels of RNA that enter the cytoplasm even without an RNA export element present (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Coyle et al., 2003</xref>). In order to test the CTE functionality of the SERV-K/MER11 HML-8-derived region in the context of a replicating, natively CTE-using virus, we cloned this region (including both the HML-8 <italic>env-</italic>derived region and the MER11 element) into a GFP-tagged MPMV infectious clone in place of the original MPMV CTE, and tested this construct’s ability to generate infectious virus in a single round, VSV-G pseudotyped assay. Remarkably, this chimeric virus generated near wild-type levels of infectious virus, in contrast to an MPMV construct with the wt CTE deleted, which completely abrogated infection.</p><p>We do not yet know what RNA trafficking pathway is used by the MER11 CTE, although it could plausibly use either the NXF1/Tap pathway used by MPMV and other retroviruses (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">Kang and Cullen, 1999</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib47">Lindtner et al., 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib69">Sakuma et al., 2014</xref>), or the CRM1/XPO1 pathway, used by foamy viruses (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Bodem et al., 2011</xref>), and also by retroviruses that use Rev/RRE-like systems (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Bogerd et al., 1998</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib84">Yang et al., 1999</xref>). Interestingly MLV and WHV appear to use multiple export pathways; MLV uses both NXF1- and CRM1-dependent export (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Bartels and Luban, 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib56">Mougel et al., 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib59">Pessel-Vivares et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib61">Pilkington et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib69">Sakuma et al., 2014</xref>), and the WPRE has both CRM1-dependent and -independent functional elements <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib63">Popa et al., 2002</xref>; the pathway used by MusD is still unknown (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib44">Legiewicz et al., 2010</xref>). It seems plausible to us that the MER11 transport element mechanism may be similarly complex.</p><p>Strikingly, the GFP/mCherry ratio of the NL4-3-derived vector containing a MER11 CTE is more than 35 times higher than that of one containing the MPMV CTE, suggesting that it may have higher RNA transport activity. However, it is important to note that the MER11 element in these reporter assays is in the context of a lentiviral genome rather than its native genomic context, which could alter its phenotype in important ways. Additionally, the readout of this assay, eGFP expression, is not a direct measure of RNA export, but rather can be affected by other factors such as RNA stability and translation efficiency. Thus at this time we cannot determine the ‘true’ RNA export efficiency of the MER11 element relative to the other export elements tested, and we cannot rule out the possibility that it may have other effects such as increasing translation efficiency, as has been seen for other PTEs. It is also interesting to consider whether the presence of elements that strongly promote nuclear export of intron-retaining RNAs throughout the macaque genome might have significant effects on alternative splicing of host genes, and whether HML-8 elements in the human genome might also contain CTEs that promote export of host mRNAs with retained introns. The NXF1 gene itself contains a CTE which has been shown to promote export of an alternate NXF1 isoform, and it seems plausible that ERVs might have contributed similar elements to other genes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib45">Li et al., 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib46">Li et al., 2016</xref>). The presence of a clade of very similar recombinant proviruses in the white-cheeked gibbon genome that clusters within the diversity of OWM SERV-K/MER11 sequences, as well as the absence of such proviruses from great apes strongly suggests that SERV-K/MER11 has undergone at least one interspecies transmission event. The gibbon-specific clade clusters with a group of proviruses from the GSM, a member of the Colobinae subfamily of OWM; curiously, this gibbon-GSM clade is nested within a larger clade that is otherwise specific to the Cercopithecinae subfamily. This tree structure may indicate an earlier interspecies transmission from a cercopithecine monkey to a colobine lineage ancestral to the GSM, which later crossed into gibbons; however, these deeper nodes in the phylogenies are relatively low confidence, and we cannot rule out alternative evolutionary scenarios. This is, to our knowledge, the first evidence of interspecies transmission of a virus in the HERV-K HML-2 clade, and raises a number of interesting questions, most notably, whether macaques or other OWM species still contain actively replicating SERV-K/MER11 viruses, and whether those viruses are also capable of interspecies transmission. Although the current ranges of GSM and northern white-cheeked gibbons do not overlap, the ranges of other members of their respective genera do, as do the ranges of rhesus and other macaques, consistent with the interspecies transmission or transmissions having taken place in southern Asia.</p><p>The oldest gibbon provirus we have been able to estimate an integration time for is ~2.4 million years old, indicating that the interspecies transmission to gibbons took place at least 2.4 million years ago. We were unable to estimate integration times for most of the gibbon proviruses because their 5′ and 3′ LTRs had discordant phylogenies, indicating that they have undergone some type of recombination event; one provirus appears to be derived from a crossover recombination between two separate proviruses, resulting in a reciprocal chromosomal translocation. Similar HML-2-mediated genomic rearrangements have been observed in the human genome, however no reciprocal pairs of recombinants were identified in humans (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Hughes and Coffin, 2001</xref>). More detailed understanding of the timing and location of this transmission event may be provided by screening the genomes of other Asian primate species for SERV-K/MER11 proviruses.</p><p>It is also worth considering whether interspecies transmission has any implications for the biology of these viruses. The evidence for at least one and possibly more such transmission events is strong, and geographic proximity makes contact between the GSM and white-cheeked gibbon lineages plausible; however, both species are herbivorous, removing perhaps the most straightforward route of transmission, predation, from consideration. Additionally, the titres of reconstituted HML-2 viruses in cell culture are relatively low, which would seem to make transmission via incidental contact unlikely (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Dewannieux et al., 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib43">Lee and Bieniasz, 2007</xref>). It is possible that the recombinant CTE and/or LTR deletions may have altered the biology of SERV-K/MER11 compared to HERV-K HML-2 in some way that makes interspecies transmission easier.</p><p>In summary, we have characterized a clade of ERVs in rhesus macaques that may serve as a valuable model for investigating viral evolution over deep time, and as a model for HERV-K HML-2 virology and pathogenesis. This clade provides a high resolution record of the evolution of a single viral lineage going back approximately 25 million years, potentially up to the present day, that has undergone multiple significant evolutionary transitions, including recombination with divergent viral lineages and interspecies transmission to divergent host species. Rhesus macaques are a well-characterized model organism for human disease; if these viruses are still actively replicating in macaques or other OWM species, they could provide an opportunity to observe the infection dynamics of an HML-2-like virus in a natural host, which could provide insights on currently incompletely understood aspects of HML-2 biology, such as tropism, pathogenic potential, receptor usage, and mode of transmission. Lastly, we have demonstrated that SERV-K/MER11 contains a novel CTE; this provides a fascinating opportunity to investigate the evolution of a retrovirus as it shifted from using a Rev/RRE-type system to a CTE-type system, and to observe how two closely related viruses that use very different RNA trafficking mechanisms differ in their replication dynamics.</p></sec><sec id="s4" sec-type="methods"><title>Methods</title><sec id="s4-1"><title>Genome mining</title><p>To initially identify SERV-K1-like proviruses in rhesus macaques, the BLAST-Like Alignment Tool (BLAT) on the USCG Genome Browser website (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://genome.ucsc.edu/cgi-bin/hgBlat">http://genome.ucsc.edu/cgi-bin/hgBlat</ext-link>, accessed December 3, 2019) was used to search the Mmul_8.0.1/rheMac8 and Mmul_10/rheMac10 genome assemblies, using the SERV-K1 proviral genome as a query sequence with the default search settings.

Infectivity was measured as % GFP expressing cells.</p></sec></sec></body><back><sec sec-type="additional-information" id="s5"><title>Additional information</title><fn-group content-type="competing-interest"><title>Competing interests</title><fn fn-type="COI-statement" id="conf1"><p>No competing interests declared</p></fn></fn-group><fn-group content-type="author-contribution"><title>Author contributions</title><fn fn-type="con" id="con1"><p>Conceptualization, Data curation, Formal analysis, Supervision, Investigation, Visualization, Methodology, Writing - original draft, Writing - review and editing</p></fn><fn fn-type="con" id="con2"><p>Formal analysis, Investigation, Visualization, Methodology, Writing - review and editing</p></fn><fn fn-type="con" id="con3"><p>Data curation, Formal analysis, Investigation, Methodology, Writing - review and editing</p></fn><fn fn-type="con" id="con4"><p>Resources, Investigation, Methodology</p></fn><fn fn-type="con" id="con5"><p>Resources, Investigation</p></fn><fn fn-type="con" id="con6"><p>Investigation</p></fn><fn fn-type="con" id="con7"><p>Supervision, Funding acquisition, Writing - review and editing</p></fn><fn fn-type="con" id="con8"><p>Conceptualization, Supervision, Funding acquisition, Writing - review and editing</p></fn></fn-group></sec><sec sec-type="supplementary-material" id="s6"><title>Additional files</title><supplementary-material id="mdar"><label>MDAR checklist</label><media xlink:href="elife-80216-mdarchecklist1-v2.docx" mimetype="application" mime-subtype="docx"/></supplementary-material></sec><sec sec-type="data-availability" id="s7"><title>Data availability</title><p>All data generated or analyzed during this study are included in the manuscript and supporting files, or are re-analyses of publically available data; source data files have been provided for Figures 1–5, 7, and 8.</p><p>The following previously published dataset was used:</p><p><element-citation publication-type="data" specific-use="references" id="dataset1"><person-group person-group-type="author"><name><surname>Fang</surname><given-names>R</given-names></name><name><surname>Liu</surname><given-names>K</given-names></name><name><surname>Zhao</surname><given-names>Y</given-names></name><name><surname>Li</surname><given-names>H</given-names></name><name><surname>Zhu</surname><given-names>D</given-names></name><name><surname>Du</surname><given-names>Y</given-names></name><name><surname>Xiang</surname><given-names>C</given-names></name><name><surname>Li</surname><given-names>X</given-names></name><name><surname>Liu</surname><given-names>H</given-names></name><name><surname>Miao</surname><given-names>Z</given-names></name><name><surname>Zhang</surname><given-names>X</given-names></name><name><surname>Shi</surname><given-names>Y</given-names></name><name><surname>Yang</surname><given-names>W</given-names></name><name><surname>Xu</surname><given-names>J</given-names></name><name><surname>Deng</surname><given-names>H</given-names></name></person-group><year iso-8601-date="2014">2014</year><data-title>Generation of Naïve Induced Pluripotent Stem Cells from Rhesus Monkey Fibroblasts</data-title><source>NCBI Sequence Read Archive</source><pub-id pub-id-type="accession" xlink:href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/sra/?term=SRR1575130">SRR1575130</pub-id></element-citation></p></sec><ack id="ack"><title>Acknowledgements</title><p>We would like to thank Marie-Louise Hammarskjold, David Rekosh, Patrick Jackson, and Sara Rasmussen at the University of Virginia School of Medicine for generously providing us with the HML-2 RcRE dual reporter construct and Rec expression construct, which we used for experiments and to create the SERV-K/MER11 reporter and expression constructs.

rhesus macaques, concluding that an HML-2 provirus underwent an ancient recombination event with a HERV-K (HML-8) related virus. The authors provide solid evidence to suggest that the recombinant retrovirus acquired a distinct mechanism for the regulation of expression of spliced and unspliced transcripts. The work should be of broad interest to virologists, as it uses molecular 'fossil-like' evidence from the genomes of modern primates to document the generation of what could be considered a new retrovirus species through recombination.</p></body></sub-article><sub-article article-type="decision-letter" id="sa1"><front-stub><article-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.80216.sa1</article-id><title-group><article-title>Decision letter</article-title></title-group><contrib-group content-type="section"><contrib contrib-type="editor"><name><surname>Weigel</surname><given-names>Detlef</given-names></name><role>Reviewing Editor</role><aff><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="ror">https://ror.org/0243gzr89</institution-id><institution>Max Planck Institute for Biology Tübingen</institution></institution-wrap><country>Germany</country></aff></contrib></contrib-group><contrib-group><contrib contrib-type="reviewer"><name><surname>Hammarskjöld</surname><given-names>Marie-Louise</given-names></name><role>Reviewer</role><aff><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="ror">https://ror.org/0153tk833</institution-id><institution>University of Virginia</institution></institution-wrap><country>United States</country></aff></contrib><contrib contrib-type="reviewer"><name><surname>Bieniasz</surname><given-names>Paul D</given-names></name><role>Reviewer</role><aff><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="ror">https://ror.org/0420db125</institution-id><institution>Rockefeller University</institution></institution-wrap><country>United States</country></aff></contrib></contrib-group></front-stub><body><boxed-text id="sa2-box1"><p>Our editorial process produces two outputs: (i) <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://sciety.org/articles/activity/10.1101/2022.05.11.490678">public reviews</ext-link> designed to be posted alongside <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://www.biorxiv.org/content/10.1101/2022.05.11.490678v1">the preprint</ext-link> for the benefit of readers; (ii) feedback on the manuscript for the authors, including requests for revisions, shown below.

Your article has been reviewed by 2 peer reviewers, and the evaluation has been overseen by a Reviewing Editor and Sara Sawyer as the Senior Editor. The following individuals involved in the review of your submission have agreed to reveal their identity: Marie-Louise Hammarskjöld (Reviewer #1); Paul D Bieniasz (Reviewer #2).</p><p>The reviewers have discussed their reviews with one another, and the Reviewing Editor has drafted this to help you prepare a revised submission.</p><p>Essential revisions (for the authors):</p><p>1) The potential of CTE function is one of the most interesting aspects of this work, but the data provided to support this argument are not conclusive. It will be essential that the authors provide additional evidence of CTE function (e.g., at least some of the RNA experiments suggested by reviewer #1). This is the sole major weakness of the manuscript but it is a substantial one and it is expected that additional experiments are performed to significantly strengthen this inference.</p><p><italic>Reviewer #1 (Recommendations for the authors):</italic></p><p>I consider the bioinformatic analysis presented in this manuscript to be very interesting and convincing. It clearly forms a basis for further studies of HERV-K-like viruses in rhesus macaques and other OWM species. Importantly, it suggests the ongoing activity of these viruses and maybe even ongoing infections. However, this remains speculative in the absence of data to show cytoplasmic RNA (particularly unspliced full-length RNA) and HERV protein expression. Such data would make the manuscript much more interesting.</p><p>To show that the SERV-K/MER11 proviruses indeed contain a functional bona fide CTE, the authors will have to directly demonstrate that completely unspliced GFP mRNA is exported from the nucleus. This could be done by analyzing total and cytoplasmic RNA and showing a direct effect on export. This should be complemented by an analysis of proviral RNA (total and cytoplasmic) from cells that are transcribing one or more of these proviruses. This will serve to verify that unspliced full-length SERV mRNA is exported from the nucleus when the proposed CTE is present. They should also further map the proposed CTE to obtain a &quot;minimal&quot; functional element and determine whether this element interacts with Nxf1.

To do this, we used Mason-Pfizer monkey virus (MPMV), which is the canonical CTE-using virus used by Dr. Hammarskjold and her colleagues to discover the prototypical CTE. In addition, MPMV is also a primate betaretrovirus, and thus belongs to the same genus as the SERV-K elements described in the manuscript. Specifically, we show that by adding the HML-8-derived region of SERV-K/MER11 to an MPMV provirus with its original CTE deleted, we can rescue viral infectivity to near wild type levels. As nuclear export of full length viral RNA is absolutely required for retroviral infectivity, we believe this functional result constitutes direct proof that the element we described must provide viral RNA nuclear export activity.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Reviewer #1 (Recommendations for the authors):</p><p>I consider the bioinformatic analysis presented in this manuscript to be very interesting and convincing.

We believe that the infectivity of the chimeric viruses we have generated shows conclusively that the HML8-derived region of SERV-K/MER11 must have CTE-like activity. We agree that determining the minimal functional CTE and the pathway or pathways used by this CTE are questions of great interest, and are actively working to answer these questions, however they are not within the scope of this study, and will require significant, additional work. We believe the reviewer will find that the discussion is now appropriately cautious in its claims and acknowledgement of the additional work that needs to be done to define the role or roles this element plays.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Reviewer #2 (Recommendations for the authors):</p><p>One reference is erroneously cited : (Young N L and Bieniasz, 2007) should be (Lee Y N and Bieniasz 2007). – it's an Asian name that has apparently been rearranged.</p></disp-quote><p>We thank the reviewer for catching this error!
