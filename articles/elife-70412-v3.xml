We show that Zinc Fingers and Homeoboxes 2 (<italic>ZHX2</italic>) is amplified or overexpressed in TNBC cell lines and patients. Functionally, depletion of ZHX2 inhibited TNBC cell growth and invasion in vitro, orthotopic tumor growth, and spontaneous lung metastasis in vivo. Mechanistically, ZHX2 bound with hypoxia-inducible factor (HIF) family members and positively regulated HIF1α activity in TNBC. Integrated ChIP-seq and gene expression profiling demonstrated that ZHX2 co-occupied with HIF1α on transcriptionally active promoters marked by H3K4me3 and H3K27ac, thereby promoting gene expression. Among the identified ZHX2 and HIF1α coregulated genes, overexpression of <italic>AP2B1</italic>, <italic>COX20</italic>, <italic>KDM3A</italic>, or <italic>PTGES3L</italic> could partially rescue TNBC cell growth defect by <italic>ZHX2</italic> depletion, suggested that these downstream targets contribute to the oncogenic role of ZHX2 in an accumulative fashion. Furthermore, multiple residues (R491, R581, and R674) on ZHX2 are important in regulating its phenotype, which correspond with their roles on controlling ZHX2 transcriptional activity in TNBC cells. These studies establish that ZHX2 activates oncogenic HIF1α signaling, therefore serving as a potential therapeutic target for TNBC.</p></abstract><kwd-group

of all breast cancer (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Anders and Carey, 2009</xref>). TNBC is associated with a more aggressive clinical history, a higher likelihood of distant metastasis, shorter survival, and a higher mortality rate compared to other subtypes of breast cancer (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Anders and Carey, 2009</xref>). In addition, recent studies illustrate high rates of brain metastasis in TNBC that is associated with poor survival (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Heitz et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">Lin et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib48">Niwińska et al., 2010</xref>). Since TNBCs do not express estrogen receptor (ER), progesterone receptor (PR), or human epidermal growth factor receptor 2 (HER2), treatment options have historically been limited to chemotherapy (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib44">Masui et al., 2013</xref>), which has significant toxicity and a suboptimal impact on the 5-year relapse rate. Therefore, it is critical to identify novel therapeutic targets in TNBC.</p><p>The Zinc Fingers and Homeoboxes (<italic>ZHX</italic>) family includes <italic>ZHX</italic>1, 2, and 3. <italic>ZHX2</italic> is located on 8q24.13 and contains two zinc finger domains and five homeodomains (HDs) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Kawata et al., 2003</xref>). In addition, between amino acids 408 and 488, it contains a proline-rich region (PRR). ZHX2 can form homodimers or can heterodimerize with the other two family members ZHX1 or ZHX3 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Kawata et al., 2003</xref>). Originally, ZHX2 was found to be a key transcriptional repressor for the alpha-fetoprotein regulator 1 (<italic>Afr1</italic>) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib54">Perincheri et al., 2005</xref>), which is an important oncogene in liver cancer. From this perspective, ZHX2 was identified and reported to function as a transcriptional repressor (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Kawata et al., 2003</xref>), where fusion of ZHX2 with a GAL4-DNA-binding domain repressed transcription of a GAL4-dependent luciferase reporter. Additionally, ZHX2 was reported to have tumor suppressor activity in hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC), by repressing cyclin A, E, and multidrug resistance 1 (MDR1) expression (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib42">Ma et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib68">Yue et al., 2012</xref>). ZHX2 was also indicated to be a tumor suppressor in Hodgkin lymphoma or myeloma although there is no direct experimental evidence supporting this hypothesis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Armellini et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib47">Nagel et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib46">Nagel et al., 2011</xref>).</p><p>However, accumulating evidence suggests that ZHX2 may contribute to cancer pathology in other contexts. Tissue microarray and clinicopathological analysis show that ZHX2 protein expression in metastatic HCC is twice as high as in the primary lesions, indicating that ZHX2 expression is associated with metastasis in HCC (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Hu et al., 2007</xref>). In addition, our recent findings through genome-wide screening identify that ZHX2 is a substrate of von Hippel Lindau (gene name <italic>VHL</italic>, protein name pVHL) protein, accumulates in kidney cancer, and promotes oncogenic signaling by at least partially activating nuclear factor κB (NF-κB) signaling in clear cell renal cell carcinoma (ccRCC) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib70">Zhang et al., 2018</xref>). These pieces of evidence suggest that ZHX2 acts as a tumor suppressor or oncogene in a context-dependent manner. It is also important to point out that <italic>ZHX2</italic> is located on 8q24, a genomic region that is frequently amplified in various cancers including breast cancer (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Guan et al., 2007</xref>). More importantly, the role of ZHX2 in other cancers, such as in TNBC, remains largely unknown.</p><p>Tumor hypoxia is a characteristic of most solid tumors. Hypoxic cells are known to confer radio- or chemotherapeutic resistance, and therefore are hypothesized to undergo positive selection during cancer development (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Brown and Wilson, 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Gray et al., 1953</xref>). The key proteins mediating oxygen sensing in these cells involve two classes of proteins: (1) upstream oxygen sensors, namely the prolyl hydroxylases EglN1–3, responsible for the hydroxylation of various substrates, such as hypoxia-inducible factor (HIF), FOXO3a, ADSL, SFMBT1, and TBK1 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Hu et al., 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib40">Liu et al., 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib62">Semenza, 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib71">Zheng et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib72">Zurlo et al., 2019</xref>); (2) the downstream VHL E3 ligase complex. For example, EglN family members (EglN1, primarily in vivo) hydroxylate HIF1α on proline 402 and 564 positions, which lead to pVHL binding and HIF1α ubiquitination and degradation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Appelhoff et al., 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Ivan et al., 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Jaakkola et al., 2001</xref>). HIF1α has been well established to be an important oncogene in multiple cancers, including breast cancer (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Briggs et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib61">Semenza, 2010</xref>). Tumor hypoxia or pVHL loss will lead to the accumulation of HIF1α. As a result of the accumulation and translocation of HIFα factors into the nucleus, HIF1α dimerizes with a constitutively expressed HIF1β subunit (also called ARNT) and transactivates genes that have hypoxia response elements (HREs, sequence: NCGTG) in promoters or enhancer regions. HIF1-transactivated genes include those involved in angiogenesis (e.g., <italic>VEGF</italic>), glycolysis and glucose transport (e.g., <italic>SLC2A1</italic>), and erythropoiesis (e.g., <italic>EPO</italic>) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib62">Semenza, 2012</xref>). Besides tumor hypoxia or pVHL loss, other potential regulators of HIF1α may exist, which remains to be investigated.</p><p>In our current study, we investigated the role of <italic>ZHX2</italic> as a new oncogene in TNBC, where it activates HIF1α signaling.

However, the role of ZHX2 in other cancers remains largely unclear. In addition, it is unclear whether ZHX2 also acts as a pVHL target in breast cancer. Since TNBC had the highest ZHX2 amplification rate in all breast cancer subtypes (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1C</xref><italic>,</italic> <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="supp1">Supplementary file 1a</xref>), we decided to focus on TNBC for this current study. To this purpose, we first examined the relationship between the expression of ZHX2 and pVHL in several TNBC cell lines (MDA-MB-231, MDA-MB-436, MDA-MB-468, HCC3153, and HCC70) as well as two normal breast epithelial cell lines, HMLE and MCF-10A. Interestingly, all TNBC cell lines displayed relatively lower pVHL protein levels corresponding with higher ZHX2 protein level when compared to normal breast cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1C</xref>). Our co-immunoprecipitation (Co-IP) experiments showed that ZHX2 interacts with pVHL in two representative TNBC cell lines (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1I</xref>). Next, we aimed to examine whether pVHL can promote the degradation of ZHX2, therefore decreasing ZHX2 protein levels in these cells. First, we overexpressed HA-VHL in two different TNBC cell lines (MDA-MB-231 and 468) and found that pVHL overexpression leads to decreased ZHX2 protein levels (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1J</xref>). Conversely, we also deleted <italic>VHL</italic> expression by three independent sgRNAs (#1, 2, and 8) in these two cell lines and found that pVHL depletion led to upregulation of ZHX2 protein (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1K</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1D</xref>). Our previous research showed that ZHX2 regulation by pVHL potentially depends on ZHX2 prolyl hydroxylation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib70">Zhang et al., 2018</xref>). We treated these two cell lines with hypoxia, the pan-prolyl hydroxylase inhibitor DMOG, or the proteasomal inhibitor MG132 and found that ZHX2 was upregulated by these treatments (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1L</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1E</xref>), further strengthening the conclusion that ZHX2 is regulated by pVHL for protein stability through potential prolyl hydroxylation in breast cancer. We further analyzed ZHX2 and pVHL protein levels in 10 pairs of TNBC tumors and paired normal tissue (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="supp1">Supplementary file 1b</xref>). In accordance with the cell line data, we found that ZHX2 was upregulated in most of tumor tissues compared to normal, coinciding with decreased pVHL protein levels in respective tumor tissues (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1F</xref>). To further examine the clinical relevance of pVHL with ZHX2, we obtained two sets of commercial TNBC tissue microarray (TMA, BR1301) from US Biomax, which contains 130 human TNBC specimens. We performed IHC staining to the TMA with ZHX2 and pVHL antibody and scored the IHC staining intensities (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Detre et al., 1995</xref>) of each specimen for these two proteins, respectively. We found an overall negative correlation between pVHL and ZHX2 in these TNBC samples which were divided into different staining grades based on the staining intensity (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1M, N</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1G</xref>). In conclusion, our data suggest that ZHX2 is regulated by pVHL and play an important role in TNBC.</p></sec><sec id="s2-2"><title>ZHX2 is essential for TNBC cell proliferation and invasion</title><p>Next, we examined the potential role of ZHX2 in TNBC cell proliferation and invasion.

Upon Dox addition, we achieved efficient depletion of ZHX2 protein (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3A</xref>). ZHX2 depletion upon Dox addition led to consistent decreased TNBC cell proliferation, 2D growth, and 3D anchorage-independent growth of MDA-MB-231 in vitro (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s1">Figure 3—figure supplement 1A–D</xref>). Next, we injected the <italic>ZHX2</italic> Teton shRNAs or control shRNA expressing MDA-MB-231-luc cells orthotopically into the fourth mammary fat pads of NoD SCID Gamma (NSG)-deficient mice. After palpable tumors were formed after implantation, we fed these mice Dox chow. We found that ZHX2 depletion significantly decreased tumor growth overtime (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3B</xref>), as well as reduced tumor burden retrieved from tumor-bearing mice compared to control mice upon necropsy (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3C, D</xref>).

Given the high in vivo lung metastatic feature of MDA-MB-231 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">Jin et al., 2020</xref>), we measured spontaneous lung metastasis ex vivo upon necropsy and found that ZHX2 depletion led to significantly decreased lung metastasis in MDA-MB-231 cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3F, G</xref>). Additionally, we also orthotopically injected <italic>ZHX2</italic> Teton sh45-infected MDA-MB-231 cells, followed by control or Dox chow. Consistent with results above, Dox chow led to significantly decreased TNBC tumor growth over time and decreased ZHX2 protein levels in tumors (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s1">Figure 3—figure supplement 1E–H</xref>). To confirm these results in another TNBC cell line, we also generated the inducible control or <italic>ZHX2</italic> shRNAs in HCC70-luc cells and performed the in vivo studies.

In addition to monitor tumor growth by caliper, we also performed live bioluminescence imaging over time and provide representative image of initial and end of the experiment for the HCC70-luc xenograft mice (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3J</xref>), we found that the relative bioluminescence signal intensity is consistent with the tumor volume growth (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3K</xref>).

Pathway enrichment as well as gene set enrichment analyses (GSEAs) revealed that genes differentially expressed following ZHX2 depletion were enriched for members of the hypoxia pathway (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4C</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s2">Figure 4—figure supplement 2A–C</xref>). Consistent with the lack of regulation of NF-κB components by ZHX2 by IP and western blots, we did not find the NF-κB pathway being enriched through our RNA-seq analysis pathway (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4C</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s2">Figure 4—figure supplement 2A</xref>). Overall, there were 7690 genes differentially expressed following <italic>ZHX2</italic> silencing by shRNA, and 1849 (24%) of these genes overlapped with genes differentially expressed in a previously published <italic>HIF1A</italic> and <italic>HIF2A</italic> double knockout (<italic>HIF</italic> DKO) model (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4D</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Chen et al., 2018</xref>). Since ZHX2 was similarly reported as an oncogene in ccRCC and preferentially upregulated the transcription of downstream genes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib70">Zhang et al., 2018</xref>), we focused on the 3969 ZHX2 positively regulated genes (downregulated following ZHX2 silencing by shRNA) as these genes may be more relevant in breast cancer. Of these, 678 genes (17%) overlapped with downregulated genes in the <italic>HIF</italic> DKO RNA-seq (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4E</xref>), representing a significant association (adj. p = 1.07 × 10<sup>−69</sup>). These data strengthen the potential functional link between HIF and ZHX2. The genes positively regulated by ZHX2 were also enriched for other potentially relevant biological pathways such as cell adhesion and cell morphogenesis (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4C</xref>). Next, we examined whether ZHX2 depletion affected some of the canonical HIF target genes. Based on our ZHX2 RNA-seq and GSEA results (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s2">Figure 4—figure supplement 2C</xref>), we chose a few representative HIF target genes and examined their expression levels by qRT-PCR in MDA-MB-231 cells infected with control or <italic>ZHX2</italic> shRNA under either normoxia or hypoxia. As expected, hypoxia treatment increased the expression of HIF target genes, and this effect was ameliorated by ZHX2 depletion (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s2">Figure 4—figure supplement 2D</xref>), suggesting that ZHX2 affects HIF activity and regulates HIF target gene expression in TNBC. Consistently, HIF reporter assay found that ZHX2 depletion led to decreased HIF reporter activity while ZHX2 re-expression could rescue this phenomenon either under normoxia or hypoxia (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s2">Figure 4—figure supplement 2E</xref>). In addition, ZHX2 activated HIF reporter activity in a dose-dependent manner (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s2">Figure 4—figure supplement 2F</xref>).</p><fig-group><fig id="fig4" position="float"><label>Figure 4.</label><caption><title>ZHX2 regulates hypoxia-inducible factor (HIF) signaling in triple-negative breast cancer (TNBC).</title><p>(<bold>A, B</bold>) Venn diagrams showing the overlap in downregulated (<bold>A</bold>) or upregulated (<bold>B</bold>) differentially expressed genes (DEGs) between <italic>ZHX2</italic> shRNA 43 and 45.

Consider a well characterization on HIF1 function in TNBC tumorigenesis by previous studies (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Bos et al., 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Briggs et al., 2016</xref>). We first performed Co-IP experiments and showed that ZHX2 bound with HIF1α and HIF1β exogenously as well as endogenously (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4F–H</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s2">Figure 4—figure supplement 2G</xref>). In addition, ZHX2 knockdown led to decreased HIF1α protein levels in two TNBC cell lines under hypoxia condition (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4I, J</xref>). Conversely, ZHX2 overexpression led to increased HIF1α protein levels under normoxia (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4K</xref>). However, these ZHX2 loss-of-function or gain-of-function manipulations did not grossly change HIF2α protein level (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4J, K</xref>). Co-IP experiments showed that ZHX2 could not bind with HIF2α (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4L</xref>). These results suggest that ZHX2 regulates the hypoxia signaling mainly through HIF1α. Interestingly, qRT-PCR showed that ZHX2 overexpression did not increase <italic>HIF1A</italic> mRNA level (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4M</xref>), suggesting a mechanism of post-transcriptional regulation on HIF1α. We then treated the ZHX2 knockdown cells with the proteasome inhibitor MG132 under hypoxia, which could fully rescue the HIF1α protein level in the knockdown cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4N</xref>). Our ubiquitination assay also showed that overexpression of ZHX2 could protect HIF1α from ubiquitination and subsequent degradation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4O</xref>). Altogether, these data suggested ZHX2 controls HIF1α protein stability by preventing proteasome-mediated degradation. On the other hand, western blot analysis showed that HIF1α knockdown did not affect ZHX2 protein levels (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s2">Figure 4—figure supplement 2H</xref>). It is important to note that the detailed mechanism on how ZHX2 binds with HIF1 and transactivates HIF1 signaling remains unclear, which awaits future investigation.</p><p>To identify the direct downstream target genes of ZHX2 and HIF that may be important in TNBC, we performed chromatin IP followed by high-throughput sequencing (ChIP-seq) to assess the genomic binding pattern of ZHX2 in TNBC. We identified 957 binding sites across the genome, of which 94% of them overlap with H3K27ac and 96% of them overlap with H3K4me3 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5A</xref>), indicating these overlapping peaks bound preferentially to active promoters for gene expression (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib63">Shlyueva et al., 2014</xref>). We again focused on the ZHX2 positively regulated genes (downregulated following <italic>ZHX2</italic> silencing by shRNA) that exhibited ZHX2 binding in the promoter (transcription start site ±5 kb). These promoters (<italic>n</italic> = 258) demonstrated robust enrichment for HIF1α (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Chen et al., 2018</xref>), as well as H3K4me3 and H3K27ac (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib59">Rhie et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5A</xref>). We then filtered these genes further, focusing on only those bound and positively regulated by HIF1α and identified seven interesting candidate genes for follow-up functional validation (<italic>PTGES3L</italic>, <italic>KDM3A</italic>, <italic>WSB1</italic>, <italic>AP2B1</italic>, <italic>OXSR1</italic>, <italic>RUNDC1</italic>, and <italic>COX20</italic>). We performed qRT-PCR analysis and found that <italic>ZHX2</italic> depletion by shRNAs indeed led to decreased mRNA expression for all of these target genes (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5B</xref>). Conversely, we also overexpressed ZHX2 in TNBC cells and found that ZHX2 overexpression led to increased expression of these target genes (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5C</xref>), arguing that ZHX2 promotes HIF signaling by at least directly activating these targets in TNBC. To further strengthen whether these are HIF downstream target genes, we also obtained <italic>HIF</italic> DKO cells and found that HIF depletion led to decreased expression of these target genes under hypoxic conditions (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5D</xref>).

In that setting, ZHX2 may act as transcriptional activator by overlapping primarily with H3K4me3 and H3K27Ac epigenetic marks. However, it remains unclear whether there may be critical residues on ZHX2 that may mediate its binding to DNA and exert its transcriptional activity. To this end, we conducted both data-driven analyses and structural simulations to predict the essential DNA-binding residues. Detailed methods are described in <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="supp1">Supplementary file 1</xref>. Briefly, many DNA-bound structures of human HD2, 3 and 4 (PDB ID: 3NAU, 2DMP, and 3NAR) were homology modeled by SWISS-MODEL (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib66">Waterhouse et al., 2018</xref>) using as many X-ray/NMR-solved homologous DNA-bound HD proteins as the structural templates. 12, 20, and 15 DNA-bound complexes were modeled for HD2, HD3, and HD4, respectively (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6s1">Figure 6—figure supplement 1</xref>). We then counted the number of DNA–protein contacts at the atomic level for each residue in the DNA-contacting helices in HDs, normalized by the number of DNA-complexed structures used for each HD. The top-ranked DNA-contacting residues in HDs are listed together with their evolutionary conservation in <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="supp1">Supplementary file 1c</xref>. We found that Lys485/Arg491 in HD2, Arg581 in HD3, and Arg674 in HD4 are the most contacted residues in DNA binding, where Arg674 receives the highest contact among all the HD proteins. Our molecular dynamics (MD) simulations further revealed that Arg491 in HD2, Arg581 in HD3, and Arg674 in HD4 indeed have the highest affinity with DNA, in terms of molecular mechanics Poisson–Boltzmann surface area (MM/PBSA)-derived contact potential energies (see <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="supp1">Supplementary file 1d,e</xref> <xref ref-type="video" rid="video1">Videos 1</xref>–<xref ref-type="video" rid="video3">3</xref>), among other residues in the same proteins.

Depletion of ZHX2 leads to decreased TNBC cell proliferation as well as invasion. By performing gene expression analyses, ZHX2-regulated genes display a significant overlap with HIF-regulated genes in TNBC. ZHX2 binds with HIF1α and HIF1β and regulates HIF1α protein levels and transcriptional activity. By using structural simulation and the reconstitution system, we pinpoint residues (R491, R581, and R674) on ZHX2 that may be important for its DNA-binding function as well as tumorigenic potential. Overall, our study establishes an important role of ZHX2 in regulating HIF1α signaling and tumorigenesis in TNBC.</p><p>From a genomic perspective, it is known that <italic>ZHX2</italic> is located on 8q24, a chromosomal region frequently amplified in cancers. Indeed, <italic>ZHX2</italic> is amplified in several cancers, including breast cancer, ovarian cancer, and prostate cancer. In most cases, <italic>ZHX2</italic> is coamplified with another well-established oncogene <italic>MYC</italic> (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1A–C</xref>). This finding bears several implications. First, it suggests that ZHX2 and c-Myc may act in concert in promoting tumorigenesis. Second, the role of ZHX2 in cancers can be context dependent. Although ZHX2 may be amplified in multiple cancers, its protein levels can be regulated post-transcriptionally. Our previous research showed that in ccRCC, ZHX2 can be regulated by pVHL potentially through hydroxylation on multiple proline residues in the PRR domain (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib70">Zhang et al., 2018</xref>). Therefore, the presence or absence of factors that mediate prolyl hydroxylation in the same niche as ZHX2 can dictate its regulation and downstream function. Further, it remains uncertain whether ZHX2 interacts with DNA directly or indirectly via other transcription factors to exert its transcriptional regulation on downstream target genes. The repertoire of different coactivators/repressors with which ZHX2 may interact can therefore govern its localization in the genome and thus its downstream function in different cancer settings.</p><p>By comparing the RNA-seq and ChIP-seq results, we identified seven interesting candidate genes which might be essential for maintaining the oncogenic function of ZHX2. Further rescue experiments showed at least four genes (<italic>AP2B1</italic>, <italic>COX20</italic>, <italic>KDM3A</italic>, and <italic>PTGES3L</italic>) contributed to the oncogenic role of ZHX2 in an accumulative fashion (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5F</xref>). AP2B1 is a component of the adaptor protein complex 2 (AP-2) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">Lau and Chou, 2008</xref>). This gene encodes a member of the AP-2 family of transcription factors. AP-2 proteins form homo- or heterodimers with other AP-2 family members and bind specific DNA sequences. They are thought to stimulate cell proliferation and suppress terminal differentiation of specific cell types during embryonic development. COX20 (also known as FAM36A; MIM#614698) is a mitochondrial inner membrane protein, whose known function is to chaperone COX2, a subunit of cytochrome c oxidase in the yeast’s mitochondrial matrix (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Hell et al., 2000</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib50">Otero et al., 2019</xref>). It contains two transmembrane helices and localizes to the mitochondrial membrane. Mutations in this gene can cause mitochondrial complex IV deficiency, which results in ataxia and muscle hypotonia (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">Keerthiraju et al., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib50">Otero et al., 2019</xref>). KDM3A (Lysine Demethylase 3A) is a zinc finger protein that contains a jumonji domain and had identified as the histone H3 lysine nine mono- and dimethyl demethylase enzyme (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib65">Wang et al., 2013</xref>). KDM3A is overexpressed in breast cancer tissues and our previous siRNA screening indicated that it may be important for TNBC cell growth (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">Liao et al., 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib67">Yoo et al., 2020</xref>). PTGES3L (Prostaglandin E Synthase 3-Like) is predominantly expressed in skeletal muscle. Diseases associated with PTGES3L include arthrogryposis, distal, type 2A, and spondylocarpotarsal synostosis syndrome. Limited research has explored the function of PTGES3L in tumors. Although we have identified aforementioned ZHX2 downstream targets, it is worth mentioning that ZHX2 may employ other HIF independent and unique downstream targets for its oncogenic function in TNBC (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6J</xref>).</p><p>Thus far, it remains unclear which residues on ZHX2 are critical for its transcriptional activity as well as its oncogenic role in cancer. We also did MD simulation to confirm the import residues for regulating the phenotype of ZHX2. We found that the top DNA-contacting residues across the three HDs were arginine namely Arg491, Arg581, and Arg674. In terms of interaction, it can be observed that Arg491 and Arg581 of HD2 and 3, respectively, were seen to be interacting with the DNA’s phosphate backbone throughout the 350 ns MD simulations (<xref ref-type="video" rid="video1">Videos 1</xref> and <xref ref-type="video" rid="video2">2</xref>). However, in the case of HD 4, Arg674 was seen to be interacting first with the nucleobases within 4 Å distance. Shortly after ~120 ns, the DNA slowly drifted away but this was prevented because of an interaction between Arg674 and the DNA’s phosphate backbone (<xref ref-type="video" rid="video3">Video 3</xref>). These arginine–DNA phosphate backbone interactions could be critical for the stabilization of transcription factor binding with the DNA to either stimulate or repress the transcription of a specific gene. By performing ZHX2 depletion and reconstitution experiments, we found that several residues located in the HDs of ZHX2 may be important for its oncogenic role in TNBC (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6A–F</xref>). In addition, these three arginine residues are found to be important on mediating the effect of ZHX2 on transactivating HIF1α activity in TNBC cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6I</xref>). Further research needs to be performed to determine whether these residues are critical for ZHX2 localization to DNA, either directly or indirectly via recruitment of coactivators/repressors. Lastly, given that we already found three residues important for the function of ZHX2 in TNBC, we can potentially design small peptides to competitively bind ZHX2 and inhibit its localization to DNA. By engineering these peptides to be membrane permeable, we can potentially test whether they can inhibit the oncogenic role of ZHX2 in TNBC. Given that ZHX2 inhibitors are still not available at this time, these peptide inhibitors can be used as a proof-of-principle approach to motivate further development of specific ZHX2 inhibitors in potential cancer therapies.</p><p>However, our study does carry some limitations. For examples, the detailed mechanism by which ZHX2 leads to HIF1α protein stability needs to be further examined. In addition, further investigation will be needed to perform on how to therapeutically target ZHX2 oncogenic signaling by repressing its transcriptional activity in TNBC.</p><p>Despite these limitations, our study investigates how ZHX2 signaling may transactivate HIF activity in TNBC, therefore contributing to breast tumorigenesis. In addition, we elucidate some of potential sites on ZHX2 that may be important for its oncogenic function in TNBC.</p></sec><sec id="s4" sec-type="materials|methods"><title>Materials and methods</title><table-wrap id="keyresource" position="anchor"><label>Key resources table</label><table frame="hsides" rules="groups"><thead><tr><th align="left" valign="bottom">Reagent type (species) or resource</th><th align="left" valign="bottom">Designation</th><th align="left" valign="bottom">Source or reference</th><th align="left" valign="bottom">Identifiers</th><th align="left" valign="bottom">Additional information</th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td align="left" valign="bottom">Gene (<italic>Homo sapiens</italic>)</td><td align="left" valign="bottom"><italic>ZHX2</italic></td><td align="left" valign="bottom">GenBank</td><td align="left" valign="bottom">Gene ID: 22,882</td><td align="left" valign="bottom"/></tr><tr><td align="left" valign="bottom">Cell line (<italic>Homo sapiens</italic>)</td><td align="left" valign="bottom">MDA-MB-231</td><td align="left" valign="bottom">ATCC</td><td align="left" valign="bottom">Catalog #

Your article has been reviewed by 3 peer reviewers, one of whom is a member of our Board of Reviewing Editors, and the evaluation has been overseen by Maureen Murphy as the Senior Editor. The following individual involved in review of your submission has agreed to reveal their identity: Hezhe Lv (Reviewer #3).</p><p>The reviewers have discussed their reviews with one another, and the Reviewing Editor has drafted this to help you prepare a revised submission.</p><p>Essential revisions:</p><p>1) This manuscript relies heavily on in vitro assays but in vivo experimental data needs to be strengthened, and the management of figures presenting tumorigenesis requires improvement. Also, clinical significance of ZHX2 and its subcellular localization needs to be comprehensively evaluated.</p><p>2) Several associated molecules interfering with ZHX2 needs to be investigated more accurately and detailed to convey direct evidences.</p><p>3) Several downstream genes regulated by co-occupancy of ZHX2 and HIF were listed and examined for their expression level. The main pathway responsible for the oncogenic role of ZHX2 needs to be pointed out and the experimental data should be presented.</p><p><italic>Reviewer #1 (Recommendations for the authors):</italic></p><p>1. Mechanistic study was designed in a straight and narrow manner, however several conclusions were made without detailed experiment thus direct evidence lack. Also, why directly proposed that ZHX2 could be regulated by pVHL the same way as HIF in Figure 1, which seems robust, please explain this in detail.</p><p>2. ZHX2 could interfere with HIF-1α to activate downstream gene transcription, but which downstream pathway is crucial for the oncogenesis property of ZHX2? Please describe this in the manuscript in detail and add necessary experimental data.</p><p>3. Mechanistic validation lacks clinical setting, if possible you may consider to add experiment data regarding primary cells or clinical sample.</p><p>4. In Figure 4 the authors claimed that ZHX2 could co-occupy with and stabilize HIF via inhibiting the ubiquitination degradation, direct detection of the ubiquitination level should be provided.</p><p>5. In the figures manifesting western blot results of multiple groups, bar chart would better be provided to direct exhibit the expression level of the protein.</p><p>6. In Figure 3 the primary tumor mass formed by orthotropic implantation should be taken pictures and posted along statistical results, so as the lung metastases.</p><p>7. In line 273, the seven candidate positively regulated genes by HIF-1α should be annotated for their function.</p><p><italic>Reviewer #2 (Recommendations for the authors):</italic></p><p>1. Authors need to show the overexpression of ZHX2 in TNBC patient tumor tissues using IHC to confirm its subcellular localization. Authors also need to analyze the expression of pVHL in these samples through IHC. This data will establish the clinical relevance of pVHL in regulating ZHX2.</p><p>2. For all immunoprecipitation (IP) experiments, please mention how much input was used. As the size of pVHL lies in between 24-30 kDa, and the light chain band also corresponds to approximately 25 kDa, in Figure 1G, please show the full western blot with heavy and light chain bands of IgG.</p><p>3. Authors have used only one cell line for in-vivo studies and are required to use at least two different breast cancer cell lines for experimentation to justify the significance of outcome.</p><p>4. Authors should provide bioluminescence images of mice day after injection and on the day of tumor harvesting, which is indicative of equal number of cell injections and helps in visualizing the difference in tumor growth and metastasis.</p><p>5. Did the authors analyze the slower rate of tumor growth in ZHX2-knockdown group is due to apoptosis or senescence using IHC for cleaved caspase 3 or p21 antibody?</p><p>6. Authors should provide representative photographs of tumors harvested from different animal groups. In addition, please provide the representative photographs or H and E images of lungs to compare the number and size of metastatic nodules between different groups.</p><p>7. Authors are required to evaluate the expression of proliferative (Ki-67) angiogenic markers such as CD31 or CD34 in the xenograft tumors.</p><p>8. As the manuscript falls short of making a compelling case for the mechanism described to be relevant in the clinical setting, authors should evaluate the clinical significance of ZHX2 on TNBC growth and metastasis using TNBC PDX models.</p><p>9. Authors should perform the luciferase activity in a dose dependent manner by increasing the concentration of ZHX2-expressing plasmid to assess the HIF promoter activity. Authors should include one more group in the assay: ZHX2res alone.</p><p>10. For the ease of readers, authors should provide a schematic diagram highlighting the novel findings.</p><p><italic>Reviewer #3 (Recommendations for the authors):</italic></p><p>1. Authors have demonstrated that ZHX2 promoted NF-κB activation and acted as an oncogenic driver in clear cell renal cell carcinoma. Is there any different function of ZHX2 in TNBC and clear cell renal cell carcinoma? What is the relationship between NF-κB pathway and ZHX2 in TNBC?</p><p>2. The authors presented ZHX2 and c-Myc share co-amplification in many cancer types. Is there any relationship between ZHX2 and c-Myc?</p><p>3. Throughout the manuscript that there are many syntactic errors and the labeling in some Figures is unclear (eg. Figure 4). For example, &quot;Figure 4-Figure supplement 4C&quot;, &quot;shZHX2_DN or shZHX2_DE&quot; are hard to understand what they mean, and the Figure legend for Figure 4K is missing.</p><p>4. In Figure 1F, the picture of Ponceau red staining is not correct. The last line is marker.</p><p>5. For some IP staining, like Figure 1G, Figure 4E-4G, the whole cell lysates control is missing.</p><p>6. In Figure 3, the number of mice with metastasis tumor is missing, and what's the difference between Figure 3F and Fig3K?</p><p>7. In Figure 6G, why does ZHX2 mutant lead to decreased HIFa target genes without affecting HIFa binding and protein level? The binding ability between HIFa and other ZHX2 mutants should be tested.</p><p>[Editors' note: further revisions were suggested prior to acceptance, as described below.]</p><p>Thank you for submitting your article &quot;ZHX2 Promotes HIF1a Oncogenic Signaling in Triple-Negative Breast Cancer&quot; for consideration by <italic>eLife</italic>. Your article has been reviewed by 3 peer reviewers, one of whom is a member of our Board of Reviewing Editors, and the evaluation has been overseen by Wafik El-Deiry as the Senior Editor. The reviewers have opted to remain anonymous.</p><p>The reviewers have discussed their reviews with one another, and the Reviewing Editor has drafted this to help you prepare a revised submission.</p><p>Essential revisions:</p><p>1) Data and images manifesting the role of ZHX2 on triple negative breast cancer metastasis need to be revised in Figure 3;</p><p>2) Clinical information of the included TNBC patients should better be summarized into one table and presented in the supplement.</p><p><italic>Reviewer #1 (Recommendations for the authors):</italic></p><p>The authors have made corresponding adjustments according to reviewers' comments and improved the quality much, however, there still exist several main concerns regarding the figures.</p><p>1. Expression level of ZHX2 in some of the 10 included TNBC patients is different to those provided in the initial version, and clinical information of the patients should better be provided in supplementary material;</p><p>2. Original image of western blot assay should be addressed without too much manipulation;</p><p>3. In vivo and ex vivo data exhibiting the role of ZHX2 exert on MDA-MB-231 metastasis capacity should be re-organized and more rigor;</p><p>4. Some of the replicative data in the main figure should be moved to supplementary part to achieve more clear manifestation of the results.</p><p><italic>Reviewer #2 (Recommendations for the authors):</italic></p><p>Authors have considerably improved the manuscript. However, a few things need to be clarified.</p><p>1. In supplement figure 1D, authors have knocked out VHL using different sgRNAs but even in ctrl cells there is no expression of VHL. The image is too much manipulated for brightness. Authors are requested not to modify the WB images too much (background is too white) because it makes it hard to interpret the data.</p><p>2. In-vivo metastasis results are not clear, just ex-vivo BLI analysis is not sufficient to justify the metastatic role of ZHX2. It is well established that MDA-MB-231 cells highly metastasize to lungs (recent paper: PMID: 34465361). Authors were requested to provide H and E of whole lungs or a major lobe of lung to discern the metastatic effect. This way, authors can even highlight micro metastasis in inset of the figure.</p><p><italic>Reviewer #3 (Recommendations for the authors):</italic></p><p>The authors have done a good job in addressing my prior concerns. I am satisfied with the responses to my criticisms/comments except one major question.</p><p>Fig1F. ZHX2 expression pattern is opposite in several patients compared with previous version. Authors need to provide patients' information in supplemental tables.</p></body></sub-article><sub-article article-type="reply" id="sa2"><front-stub><article-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.70412.sa2</article-id><title-group><article-title>Author response</article-title></title-group></front-stub><body><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Essential revisions:</p><p>1) This manuscript relies heavily on in vitro assays but in vivo experimental data needs to be strengthened, and the management of figures presenting tumorigenesis requires improvement.

We generated the inducible Teton shRNA HCC70-luciferase cell lines for control, ZHX2 sh43 and sh45. We have verified the knockdown efficiency by western blot as well as phenotype in these cell lines with or without doxycycline treatment, as showed in the new Figure 3B. We have injected 1E6 cells orthotopically into NSG mice and 10 mice for each group. Upon tumors were formed (50~100mm<sup>3</sup>) all mice were fed with doxycycline diet. We monitor tumor growth over time for 5 weeks after cell inoculation, tumors were dissected at the same time. Consistent with the finding from MDA-MB-231 cell line (revised Figure 3A, G, K and L), we observed significant decrease of tumorigenesis (reflected by tumor growth and harvest tumor weight) in the two ZHX2 shRNA knockdown HCC70 cells compared with the control shRNA (new Figure 3H, M and N). In addition to monitor tumor growth by caliper, as requested by reviewer, we also performed live bioluminescence imaging over time and provide representative image of initial and end of the experiment (new Figure 3I), we found that the relative bioluminescence signal intensity is consistent with the tumor volume growth (new Figure 3J).</p><p>We also provide the image for the harvest tumor from our previous mice experiment using MDA-MB-231 xenograft (new Figure 3K, L) as requested by the reviewer.</p><p>Figure. 3</p><p>To improve the clinical significance of ZHX2, we obtained 20 pairs of fresh cut normal/tumor TNBC patient slides from the tissue management core facility from UTSW and performed IHC staining with these slides, we found that an overall increased ZHX2 staining in the TNBC tumors, especially in the nuclear staining by quantification (new Figure 1G, H), suggesting overall and the nuclear located ZHX2 is upregulated in tumors from TNBC patients. In addition, we have made new samples and ran the western blot from 10 pairs of normal/tumor TNBC patient tissues, we found that 8 out of 10 samples showed increased ZHX2 expression (revised Figure 1F).</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>2) Several associated molecules interfering with ZHX2 needs to be investigated more accurately and detailed to convey direct evidences.</p></disp-quote><p>Although ZHX2 and c-Myc have similar amplification and expression manner in breast cancer (Figure A, B and E). Our data showed that knockdown ZHX2 did not affect protein level of c-Myc, suggesting the oncogenic function of ZHX2 is independent of c-Myc (revised Figure 3A, B).</p><p>We previous find that ZHX2 promoted nuclear factor κB (NF-κB) activation by directly binding with p65 and promoting its nuclear translocation in clear cell renal cell carcinoma (ccRCC) (Zhang et al., 2018). We also investigated the relationship between ZHX2 and p65 in breast cancer. We first examined the interaction of ZHX2 and p65 in breast cancer by endogenous IP with ZHX2 or p65 antibody in two TNBC cells (MDA-MB-231 and 468) (new Figure 4—figure supplement 1A, B), we did not find consistent and robust binding between ZHX2 and p65 as we observed in ccRCC. In addition, knockdown ZHX2 also did not change the gross p65 protein level (new Figure 4—figure supplement 1C), or the subcellular protein level of p65 either in cytosol or nucleus (new Figure 4—figure supplement 1D, E). Furthermore, we did not find the NF-κB pathway enriched through our RNA-seq analysis (Figure 4—figure supplement 2A). Altogether, these data suggest ZHX2 may not affect p65 translocation in TNBC. However, these preliminary data could not fully exclude the possibility that ZHX2 regulates the NF-κB signaling pathway via other factor components, which needs further investigation.</p><p>In our current study, we found that knockdown of ZHX2 affected the HIF signaling more consistently than other pathways. This gave us the rationale to examine the relationship between ZHX2 and HIF signaling. We found that ZHX2 directly interacts with and promotes stability of HIF1α, but not HIF2α (revised Figure 4E-N). On the contrary, HIF1α knockdown does not affect ZHX2 protein level (revised Figure 4—figure supplement 2H). We also identified 7 potential direct downstream genes that could be co-occupied and regulated by ZHX2 and HIF1α (Figure. 5). In this revision, we examined the direct downstream targets that responsible for the oncogenic role of ZHX2 (See response for major point 3).</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>3) Several downstream genes regulated by co-occupancy of ZHX2 and HIF were listed and examined for their expression level. The main pathway responsible for the oncogenic role of ZHX2 needs to be pointed out and the experimental data should be presented.</p></disp-quote><p>We appreciate the constructive comments from the editor and reviewers. We have identified 7 direct downstream targets of ZHX2 and HIF1α (Figure 5A-D). To determine which gene is essential for maintaining the oncogenic function of ZHX2, we performed rescue experiments by overexpressing these downstream target genes. We got six plenti6.3 based expression constructs (PTGES3L, KDM3A, WSB1, AP2B1, OXSR1 and COX20) from DNASU (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://dnasu.org/DNASU/Home.do">https://dnasu.org/DNASU/Home.do</ext-link>) except RUNDC1, and verified these plasmids by sequencing before use. We decide to perform rescue experiment for these 6 genes. Upon generating stable blasticidin selected cell lines for each gene in MDA-MB-231, we subsequently knocked down ZHX2 by sh45 in each stable cell lines and selected by puromycin for 4 days followed by performing 2-D colony formation and 3-D soft agar growth. We eventually found that 5 genes expressed with expected size except OXSR1 in these selected stable cell lines (new Figure 5E). We performed two independent 2-D colony formation assays and found that at least 4 genes (AP2B1, COX20, KDM3A, and PTGES3L) could partially rescue the growth by ZHX2 depletion (new Figure 5F, G). As expected, the cell line failed to express OXSR1 could not rescue the phenotype. The partially rescue phenotype suggested that these downstream targets contribute to the oncogenic role of ZHX2 in an accumulative fashion.</p><p>Figure 5</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Reviewer #1 (Recommendations for the authors):</p><p>1.

Also, why directly proposed that ZHX2 could be regulated by pVHL the same way as HIF in Figure 1, which seems robust, please explain this in detail.</p></disp-quote><p>We thanks the comments from the reviewer. We first demonstrated that ZHX2 is subjected to VHL regulation in renal cancer (Zhang et al., 2018). We want to establish the boarder implication that VHL can regulate ZHX2 protein stability in different cancer contexts, including renal cancer and breast cancer. HIF is a well know substrate of VHL, and HIF1α plays important role in breast cancer tumorigenesis (Briggs et al., 2016; Chen et al., 2014). We want to emphasis that ZHX2 and HIF1α both are important targets of VHL, indicating a similar upstream regulatory mechanism in TNBC. More importantly, we found that ZHX2 directly bound and regulated HIF1α in this study, suggesting ZHX2 is oncogenic important for TNBC.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>2.

KDM3A is overexpressed in breast cancer tissues (Yoo et al., 2020). WSB1 was the E3 ubiquitin ligase and has an intriguing role in regulating immune responsiveness, glycolysis, hypoxia, development or growth of cancer (Haque et al., 2016). Dysregulation of WSB1 expression has been documented in diverse cancer cell types, including breast cancer, neuroblastoma, hepatocellular carcinoma, pancreatic, and osteosarcoma (Haque et al., 2016). OXSR1 belongs to the Ser/Thr protein kinase family of proteins and regulates downstream kinases in response to environmental stress and may play a role in regulating the actin cytoskeleton (Li et al., 2020). COX20 (also known as FAM36A; MIM#614698) is a mitochondrial inner membrane protein, whose known function is to chaperone COX2, a subunit of cytochrome c oxidase in the yeast’s mitochondrial matrix (Hell et al., 2000; Otero et al., 2019). It contains two transmembrane helices and localizes to the mitochondrial membrane. Mutations in this gene can cause mitochondrial complex IV deficiency, which results in ataxia and muscle hypotonia(Otero et al., 2019).(Keerthiraju et al., 2019) AP2B1 is a component of the adaptor protein complex 2 (AP-2) (Lau and Chou, 2008). This gene encodes a member of the AP-2 family of transcription factors. AP-2 proteins form homo- or hetero-dimers with other AP-2 family members and bind specific DNA sequences. They are thought to stimulate cell proliferation and suppress terminal differentiation of specific cell types during embryonic development. RUNDC1 contains a RUN (RPIP8, UNC-14 and NESCA) domain and a coiled coil domain. The encoded protein may negatively regulate p53 transcriptional activity (Llanos et al., 2006). PTGES3L (Prostaglandin E Synthase 3-Like) is predominantly expressed in skeletal muscle. Diseases associated with PTGES3L include arthrogryposis, distal, type 2A and spondylocarpotarsal synostosis syndrome. Limited research has explored the function of PTGES3L in tumors.</p><p>Reviewer #2 (Recommendations for the authors):</p><p>1. Authors need to show the overexpression of ZHX2 in TNBC patient tumor tissues using IHC to confirm its subcellular localization.

Anti-HA magnetic beads hydroxyl magnetic beads covalently coupled with mouse IgG3a monoclonal. Rabbit anti-ZHX2 antibody (Genetex, 112232) and rabbit anti-VHL (Cell Signaling, 68547) were used for the Western Blotting. Goat anti-rabbit secondary antibody were used as the second antibody, and cannot recognize the mouse IgG, so the heavy and light chain band of mouse IgG cannot be displayed in the WB figure.

We have verified the knockdown efficiency by western blot as well as phenotype in these cell lines with or without doxycycline treatment, as showed in the new Figure 3B. We have injected 1E6 cells orthotopically into NSG mice and 10 mice for each group. Upon tumors were formed (50~100mm<sup>3</sup>) all mice were fed with doxycycline diet. We monitor tumor growth over time for 5 weeks after cell inoculation, tumors were dissected at the same time. Consistent with the finding from MDA-MB-231 cell line (revised Figure 3A, G, K and L), we observed significant decrease of tumorigenesis (reflected by tumor growth and harvest tumor weight) in the two ZHX2 shRNA knockdown HCC70 cells compared with the control shRNA (new Figure 3H, M and N).</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>4.

Authors have demonstrated that ZHX2 promoted NF-κB activation and acted as an oncogenic driver in clear cell renal cell carcinoma. Is there any different function of ZHX2 in TNBC and clear cell renal cell carcinoma? What is the relationship between NF-κB pathway and ZHX2 in TNBC?</p></disp-quote><p>Thanks for the good suggestion. We previous find that ZHX2 promoted nuclear factor κB (NF-κB) activation by directly binding with p65 and promoting its nuclear translocation in clear cell renal cell carcinoma (ccRCC) (Zhang et al., 2018). As suggested by the reviewer, we also investigated the relationship between ZHX2 and p65 in breast cancer. We first examined the interaction of ZHX2 and p65 in breast cancer by endogenous IP with ZHX2 or p65 antibody in two TNBC cells (MDA-MB-231 and 468) (new Figure 4—figure supplement 1A and B), we did not find consistent and robust binding between ZHX2 and p65 as we observed in ccRCC. In addition, knockdown ZHX2 also did not change the gross protein level of p65 (new Figure 4—figure supplement 1C), or the subcellular protein level of p65 either in cytosol or nucleus (new Figure 4—figure supplement 1D and E). Furthermore, in our ZHX2 CHIP seq, ZHX2 did not bind with the promoter or enhancer of p65 genes. We also did not find NF-κB pathway has been enriched through our RNA-seq analysis (revised Figure 4—figure supplement 2A). Altogether, these data suggest ZHX2 may not affect p65 translocation in TNBC. However, these preliminary data could not fully exclude the possibility that ZHX2 regulates the NF-κB signaling pathway via other factor components, which needs further investigation.</p><p>In our current study, we found that knockdown of ZHX2 affected the HIF signaling most than other pathways. This gave us the rationale to examine the relationship between ZHX2 and HIF. We found that ZHX2 directly interacts with and promotes stability of HIF1α, but not HIF2α (Figure 4E – M). On the contrary, HIF1α knockdown does not affect ZHX2 protein level (revised Figure 4—figure supplement 2F). We also identified 7 potential direct downstream genes that could be co-occupied and regulated by ZHX2 and HIF1α (Figure 5). In this revision, we will examine the direct downstream targets that responsible for the oncogenic role of ZHX2 (See response for major point 3).</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>2. The authors presented ZHX2 and c-Myc share co-amplification in many cancer types. Is there any relationship between ZHX2 and c-Myc?</p></disp-quote><p>We thanks for the reviewer for the important comment. <italic>ZHX2</italic> is located on 8q24, where c-<italic>Myc</italic> resides. Analysis of copy number across different cancer types from The Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA) showed that, <italic>ZHX2</italic> and c-<italic>Myc</italic> share co-amplification in most cancer types observed (Figure 1B). In our ZHX2 RNA-seq, ZHX2 KD did not influence the mRNA level of Myc. In the ChIP-seq, ZHX2 did not bind with the promoter or enhancer of Myc genes. In addition, ZHX2 KD did not lead to c-Myc protein expression difference (Figure 3A, H). Taken together, these evidences indicate no regulatory relationship between ZHX2 and c-Myc.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>3. Throughout the manuscript that there are many syntactic errors and the labeling in some Figures is unclear (eg. Figure 4).

We have corrected all these mistakes.</p><p>In our original labelling in Figure 4A, “ZHX2 sh43 vs shCtrl_DOWN DEGs” means the downregulated differentially expressed genes (DEGs) when cells were knockdown by ZHX2 sh43 compared to control. “ZHX2 sh43 vs shCtrl_UP DEGs” means the upregulated differentially expressed genes when cells were knockdown by ZHX2 sh43 compared to control. In Figure 4C, DE means differentially expression, DN means down. “HIF DKO VS WT DE” means the DEGs when cells were double knockdown by HIF compared to the wild type. “HIF DKO VS WT DE” means the downregulated genes when cells were double knockdown by HIF compared to the wild type.</p><p>To make the labels simple for reader, we have redrawn these figures.

In Figure 3, the number of mice with metastasis tumor is missing, and what's the difference between Figure 3F and Fig3K?</p></disp-quote><p>Thanks for the comments. We used bioluminescence image to indicate the metastatic burden in the lung. However, from the bioluminescence signal, it hard to precisely exclude mice without any lung metastasis, because the signal could be too weak to determine. From the quantification value with all &gt; 0 suggesting all mice may have lung metastasis, with the possibility of background signal. There is significant signal decrease upon ZHX2 knockdown (revised Figure 3P and Q), suggesting ZHX2 promotes lung metastasis. We didn’t count the metastasis site in lung, due to short term cell line implantation during the whole animal experiment (4 weeks), we didn’t observe obvious metastatic tumor on the surface of lung.</p><p>Data from the original Figure 3F and Figure 3K represents two different sets of experiments, in Figure 3F, we compared the tumor growth between two ZHX2 shRNAs with the control shRNA. In Figure 3K, we injected the same Teton sh45 MDA-MB-231 cell line in 10 mice, then we randomized the 10 mice into two groups (5/group) with or without the doxycycline diet treatment. We realize that the second set of experiment is redundant and caused some confusion for the reader. Given we have added new animal experiment with another cell line. We thus decided to remove the data from the original Figure 3K-M.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>7. In Figure 6G, why does ZHX2 mutant lead to decreased HIFa target genes without affecting HIFa binding and protein level? The binding ability between HIFa and other ZHX2 mutants should be tested.</p></disp-quote><p>Thanks for the good comments. We speculate that ZHX2 binds to these genes independently from HIF1a, which means ZHX2 or HIF1a could bind to these genes in an independent manner. ZHX2 could interact and stabilize HIF1a, but ZHX2 is not necessary depended on the HIF1a to execute its oncogenic function. On the other hand, these mutant sites were computed for interaction site of ZHX2 with DNA, theoretically their mutation will not affect the binding with HIF1a, which likely relies on other amino acid residues. As a test of the speculation, we examined the two most important residues (681, 674) which control the oncogenic role of ZHX2 and found no binding loss of these two mutants with HIF1a (Figure 6G). We feel that examine the binding between HIF1a and other ZHX2 mutants will not add further mechanistic insight to this study. Therefore, we will not examine more interaction between HIF1a and other ZHX2 mutants. However, these speculations need further investigation, we will address these important questions in our future study.</p><p>References:</p><p>Briggs KJ, Koivunen P, Cao S, Backus KM, Olenchock BA, Patel H, Zhang Q, Signoretti S, Gerfen GJ, Richardson AL, et al. 2016.

We are very sorry for the mistake regarding supplement figure 1D, the VHL image was accidently lost when we saved the data for publication figure from the original western blots image. Please see the source data supplemental figure 1D. We also attached all of our original source western blot images to ensure our data consistency between the original western blots and organized figures. As suggested by the reviewers, we have adjusted the western blot images throughout the figures to make sure that they are consistent with their original format. Please check our updated figures.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>2. In-vivo metastasis results are not clear, just ex-vivo BLI analysis is not sufficient to justify the metastatic role of ZHX2. It is well established that MDA-MB-231 cells highly metastasize to lungs (recent paper: PMID: 34465361). Authors were requested to provide H and E of whole lungs or a major lobe of lung to discern the metastatic effect. This way, authors can even highlight micro metastasis in inset of the figure.</p></disp-quote><p>We thank the comments from reviewer. We would like to perform H&amp;E of the lung but unfortunately, we didn’t keep the lung tissues after the ex vivo imaging for further analysis so that we cannot perform this experiment at this time. We will save the lung tissues for the metastasis study in our future studies. We also want to note that in our previous and several other studies were using ex vivo BLI imaging to examine the metastasis, which showed robust and consistent results with other techniques (1-4). Again, we acknowledge the potential caveat that we did not further investigate the metastasis by other approaches in our current study.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Reviewer #3 (Recommendations for the authors):</p><p>The authors have done a good job in addressing my prior concerns. I am satisfied with the responses to my criticisms/comments except one major question.</p><p>Fig1F. ZHX2 expression pattern is opposite in several patients compared with previous version. Authors need to provide patients' information in supplemental tables.</p></disp-quote><p>We thank the comments from reviewer. In our initial western blot of the TNBC patient samples, we accidently loaded the marker together with one of the patient samples as shown in the Ponceau red staining. In his revision, we tried to rerun the WB samples however the Ponceau red staining suggested most of the proteins were degraded. Therefore, we freshly extracted new lysates from the same 10 pairs of patient frozen tissue samples and ran western blotting but in a different order of the sample organization from our initial version. Therefore, the expression pattern looks different from the initial version. We are sorry for making this confusion to the reviewers but we want to note that the overall expression of ZHX2 in these 10 pairs TNBC samples from biological replicate experiments is quite similar.</p><p>The clinical information of the included TNBC patients have been provided in the table Supplementary File 1b.</p><p>References:</p><p>1.
