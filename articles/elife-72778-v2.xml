Exopolysaccharides are usually a main component of biofilm matrix. Genes encoding glycosyl hydrolases are often found in gene clusters that are involved in the exopolysaccharide synthesis. It remains elusive about the functions of intracellular glycosyl hydrolase and why a polysaccharide synthesis gene cluster requires a glycosyl hydrolase-encoding gene. Here, we systematically studied the physiologically relevant role of intracellular PslG, a glycosyl hydrolase whose encoding gene is co-transcribed with 15 <italic>psl</italic> genes, which is responsible for the synthesis of exopolysaccharide PSL, a key biofilm matrix polysaccharide in opportunistic pathogen <italic>Pseudomonas aeruginosa</italic>. We showed that lack of PslG or its hydrolytic activity in this opportunistic pathogen enhances the signaling function of PSL, changes the relative level of cyclic-di-GMP within daughter cells during cell division and shapes the localization of PSL on bacterial periphery, thus results in long chains of bacterial cells, fast-forming biofilm microcolonies. Our results reveal the important roles of intracellular PslG on the cell fate and biofilm development.</p></abstract><kwd-group kwd-group-type="author-keywords"><kwd>Pseudomonas aeruginos</kwd><kwd>biofilm</kwd><kwd>cyclic-di-GMP</kwd><kwd>glycosyl hydrolase</kwd><kwd>PslG</kwd><kwd>polysaccharide</kwd></kwd-group><kwd-group kwd-group-type="research-organism"><title>Research organism</title><kwd>Other</kwd></kwd-group><funding-group><award-group id="fund1"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100012166</institution-id><institution>National Key Research and Development Program of China</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>2018YFA0902102</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Zhao</surname><given-names>Kun</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund2"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100001809</institution-id><institution>National Natural Science Foundation of China</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>91951204</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Ma</surname><given-names>Luyan</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund3"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100001809</institution-id><institution>National Natural Science Foundation of China</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>32070033</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Wang</surname><given-names>Di</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund4"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100001809</institution-id><institution>National Natural Science Foundation of China</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>21621004</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Ma</surname><given-names>Luyan</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund5"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100012166</institution-id><institution>National Key Research and Development Program of China</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>2019YFA0905501</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Wang</surname><given-names>Di</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund6"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100012166</institution-id><institution>National Key Research and Development Program of China</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>2019YFC804104</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Ma</surname><given-names>Luyan</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund7"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100012166</institution-id><institution>National Key Research and Development Program of China</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>2021YFA0909500</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Ma</surname><given-names>Luyan</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund8"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100004226</institution-id><institution>PetroChina Company Limited</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Wu</surname><given-names>Huijun</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><funding-statement>The funders had no role in study design, data collection and interpretation, or the decision to submit the work for publication.</funding-statement></funding-group><custom-meta-group><custom-meta specific-use="meta-only"><meta-name>Author impact statement</meta-name><meta-value>A systematical study of <italic>pslG</italic> mutants at both a single cell and community level reveals the importance of intracellular glycosyl hydrolase PslG on the cell fate and biofilm development of <italic>P. aeruginosa</italic>, an opportunistic pathogen that can cause persistent infections.</meta-value></custom-meta></custom-meta-group></article-meta></front><body><sec id="s1" sec-type="intro"><title>Introduction</title><p>Structured, surfaced-associated communities of microorganism known as biofilms are important life forms of bacteria prevailing in nature, industrial, and clinical settings (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Costerton et al., 1995</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">Stoodley et al., 2002</xref>). In general, biofilm development involves four specific stages: attachment, microcolony formation, matured microcolonies, and dispersal. Bacteria within biofilms are embedded in an extracellular matrix that protects bacterial cells from antibiotics, host defenses, and environmental stresses. Even though the components of biofilm matrix differ from species to species, it generally composes of exopolysaccharides, proteins, and nucleic acids (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">Stoodley et al., 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Flemming and Wingender, 2010</xref>). Exopolysaccharides are critical biofilm matrix components for many bacteria, which often promote attachment to surfaces and other cells, act as a scaffold to help maintain biofilm structure, and provide protection (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">Stewart and Costerton, 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Häussler and Parsek, 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">Stewart and Costerton, 2001</xref>). Gene encoding glycosyl hydrolase is often found in gene clusters that are involved in the synthesis of exopolysaccharide (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Franklin et al., 2011</xref>). Beyond of exopolysaccharide degradation, little is known about whether these genes affect bacterial physiology and biofilm development.</p><p><italic>Pseudomonas aeruginosa</italic> is an opportunistic human pathogen that can cause life-threatening infections in cystic fibrosis (CF) patients and immune-compromised individuals (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Govan and Deretic, 1996</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Lyczak et al., 2000</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Ramsey and Wozniak, 2005</xref>). <italic>P. aeruginosa</italic> can produce at least three different types of exopolysaccharides: alginate, PEL, and PSL (also named as Pel/Psl polysaccharide previously). Alginate is not expressed at high levels in the majority of non-CF isolates (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Colvin et al., 2012</xref>), whereas PSL is expressed by most <italic>P. aeruginosa</italic> natural and clinical isolates (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Colvin et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Ma et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Jennings et al., 2021</xref>). PEL is significant for biofilm formation when PSL cannot be synthesized (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Jennings et al., 2015</xref>). In <italic>P. aeruginosa</italic> PAO1, PSL is a primary scaffold matrix component that can form a fibre-like matrix to enmesh bacteria within a biofilm (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Colvin et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Ma et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib41">Wang et al., 2013</xref>). PSL has shown multiple functions in the biofilm formation of PAO1. For example, PSL can act as a ‘molecular glue’ to promote bacteria cell-cell and cell-surface interactions (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Ma et al., 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Ma et al., 2009</xref>). PSL trails on a surface guide bacteria exploration and microcolony formation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib47">Zhao et al., 2013</xref>). Moreover, PSL can also work as a barrier to protect bacteria from antibiotics and phagocytic cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Mishra et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Billings et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib40">Tseng et al., 2013</xref>). Interestingly, PSL can function as a signal to stimulate biofilm formation through affecting intracellular signal molecule cyclic-di-GMP (c-di-GMP) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Irie et al., 2012</xref>).</p><p>PSL is synthesized by <italic>psl</italic> operon, containing 15 co-transcribed genes (<italic>pslABCDEFGHIJKLMNO</italic>) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Byrd et al., 2009</xref>). PslG is a glycosyl hydrolase that encoded by <italic>pslG</italic> wthin <italic>psl</italic> operon. PslG has been shown to degrade PSL in vitro or within biofilm matrix which is released from dead bacteria (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib45">Yu et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib48">Zhao et al., 2018</xref>), hence it can inhibit biofilm formation and disrupt a formed biofilm at a nanomolar concentration (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib45">Yu et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Baker et al., 2016</xref>). PslG was first thought to be essential for PSL synthesis, since deletion of <italic>pslG</italic> gene led to a loss of PSL production (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Byrd et al., 2009</xref>). Later studies found that deletion of <italic>pslG</italic> in the earlier work has a polar effect on the expression of <italic>pslH</italic> and thus resulted in the loss of PSL production, and absence of <italic>pslG</italic> itself did not result in a complete loss of PSL production per se, but led to a less production of PSL and reduced bacterial initial attachment compared with PAO1 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Baker et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib44">Wu et al., 2019</xref>). PslG is localized mainly at the inner membrane and some in the periplasm. PslA, PslD, and PslE help PslG anchoring in the inner membrane, which is critical for PslG to be involved in the biosynthesis of PSL (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib44">Wu et al., 2019</xref>). In addition, the glycoside hydrolytic activity of PslG is also important for PSL production and the key amino acid residues for this activity are E165 and E276 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib44">Wu et al., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib45">Yu et al., 2015</xref>).</p><p>C-di-GMP is an important second messenger controlling a wide range of cellular processes in many bacteria, such as motility, cell differentiation, biofilm formation and production of virulence factors (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">Römling et al., 2013</xref>). Reports have shown that c-di-GMP is asymmetrically distributed among daughter cells upon bacterial cell division and the asymmetric division on surfaces produces specialized cell types, a spreader for dissemination and a striker for local tissue damage (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Christen et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Laventie et al., 2019</xref>). It has not been investigated whether an intracellular glycoside hydrolase would affect the c-di-GMP level.</p><p>In this work, aiming to study the effect of PslG on the cell fate and biofilm development of <italic>P. aeruginosa</italic> at the single cell level, we systematically studied the <italic>pslG</italic> in-frame deletion mutants by employing a high-throughput bacterial tracking technique (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib47">Zhao et al., 2013</xref>). The morphology and motility behavior of bacterial cells in the course of biofilm development were analyzed at the single-cell level. Using pCdrA<italic>::gfp</italic> reporter, the c-di-GMP level of each cell was also monitored. Microscopically, the attachment behavior of cells on the microtiter surfaces and the pellicles formed at the air-liquid interface were also characterized. Our data suggest that lacking of <italic>pslG</italic> impacts cell morphology, the signaling function of PSL, the c-di-GMP distribution and bacteria distribution within a biofilm. Based on our results together with those in literature, a model is proposed to understand the role of <italic>pslG</italic> in the biofilm development.</p></sec><sec id="s2" sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><sec id="s2-1"><title>Δ<italic>pslG</italic> strains cannot form rings on microtiter dish wells even when PSL production is induced to the wild-type level</title><p>Our previous study showed that the <italic>pslG</italic> in-frame deletion mutant (was named as Δ<italic>pslG</italic>2 by <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib44">Wu et al., 2019</xref> hereafter termed as Δ<italic>pslG</italic>) decreased the production of PSL and bacterial initial attachment on the microtiter surface (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib44">Wu et al., 2019</xref>). To know whether the attachment defect of Δ<italic>pslG</italic> mutant is due to PSL reduction, we replaced the promoter of <italic>psl</italic> operon by P<sub>BAD</sub> promoter in Δ<italic>pslG</italic> background, resulting in a PAO1-derived Psl-inducible Δ<italic>pslG</italic> strain (named as P<sub>BAD</sub>-<italic>psl</italic>Δ<italic>pslG</italic>), whose PSL production can be induced by the concentration of arabinose. When induced with 0.5% arabinose, P<sub>BAD</sub>-<italic>psl</italic>Δ<italic>pslG</italic> strain produced similar amount of PSL as that of PAO1 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1B</xref>). However, it was not able to form a ring at the air-liquid interface as that seen in either PAO1 or P<sub>BAD</sub>-<italic>psl</italic> strain (referred as WFPA801 previously, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Ma et al., 2006</xref>) under 0.5% arabinose induction (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1B</xref>, rings are indicated by an arrow).

Whereas PslG<sub>E165Q, E276Q</sub> (two key hydrolytic active sites of PslG were mutated) cannot complement this phenotype (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1B</xref>).

Red color indicates the surface area that has been visited by bacteria, while black color indicates a ‘fresh’ surface area that has never been visited. Bacterial cells are shown in blue. Under the same total bacterial visits (marked as <italic>N</italic> in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3A</xref>), the difference in the surface coverage between Δ<italic>pslG</italic> and PAO1 is not obvious at <italic>N</italic>~10,000. As <italic>N</italic> increases, the surface coverage of Δ<italic>pslG</italic> is clearly less than that of PAO1 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3A</xref>). At <italic>N</italic>~100,000, Δ<italic>pslG</italic> has a surface coverage of 52% ± 6% while PAO1 has 81% ± 10%. Compared with PAO1, the less efficiency in covering the surface leads to a more non-uniform bacterial visit distribution for Δ<italic>pslG</italic> (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3B</xref>). Correspondingly, by fitting the distribution of bacterial visits with a power law, different power law exponents were obtained (see one example in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3C</xref>). The averaged power law exponents of three repeats are –2.9 ± 0.1 for PAO1 and –2.5 ± 0.1 for Δ<italic>pslG</italic>. Such differences in bacterial visits distribution resulted that the time required to observe a visible microcolony (defined as clusters of more than 30 cells in this study, marked by dash lines in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3D</xref>) in the field of view is shorter for Δ<italic>pslG</italic> (5.9 ± 1.7 hr) than that for PAO1 (8.7 ± 2.4 hr). In addition, after 10 hr of growth, compared with PAO1, Δ<italic>pslG</italic> formed more microcolonies in the field of view (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3E</xref>). The microcolony formation phenotype of Δ<italic>pslG</italic> mutants can be reverted back to WT-like when they are complemented with PslG by knocking <italic>pslG</italic> into the Δ<italic>pslG</italic> mutants at the original location of <italic>pslG</italic>, namely Δ<italic>pslG::pslG</italic>. As illustrated in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3</xref>, at <italic>N</italic>~100,000, the surface coverage of Δ<italic>pslG::pslG</italic> reaches to 70% ± 7% and the power law exponent of the bacterial visit distribution is –3.2 ± 0.13 (averaged over three repeats), both are closer to those of PAO1 than those of Δ<italic>pslG</italic>. The number of microcolonies formed by Δ<italic>pslG::pslG</italic> in the field of view after 10 hr of growth is also similar to that of PAO1 and less than that of Δ<italic>pslG</italic>. The fast microcolony formation phenotype of Δ<italic>pslG</italic> mutant is also able to be complemented by PslG that is expressed from plasmid (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s1">Figure 3—figure supplement 1</xref>). However, Δ<italic>pslG::pslG<sub>E165Q,E276Q</sub></italic>, in which the key glycoside hydrolytic activity sites are mutated cannot recover WT-like phenotype (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s1">Figure 3—figure supplement 1</xref>), suggesting the importance of PslG hydrolytic activities. Complementation tests were also performed in strains from P<sub>BAD</sub>-<italic>psl</italic> background, and similar trends were observed (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s2">Figure 3—figure supplement 2</xref>). PEL has been shown to play a role in bacterial aggregation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Jennings et al., 2021</xref>), thus we also tested PEL-negative strains in wild type (ΔP<italic><sub>pel</sub></italic>) or the Δ<italic>pslG</italic> background (Δ<italic>pslG</italic>ΔP<italic><sub>pel</sub></italic>). The phenotype of Δ<italic>pslG</italic>ΔP<italic><sub>pel</sub></italic> was similar to that of Δ<italic>pslG</italic>, suggesting little contribution of PEL on the fast microcolony formation of Δ<italic>pslG</italic> (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s3">Figure 3—figure supplement 3</xref>). Tracking GFP-tagged bacteria in a flow cell also shows that the PAO1 biofilms tend to spread on surfaces (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3F</xref> and <xref ref-type="video" rid="video1">Video 1</xref>) while Δ<italic>pslG</italic> cells tend to accumulate and form microcolonies with strong fluorescence intensity (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3F</xref> and <xref ref-type="video" rid="video2">Video 2</xref>). This is consistent with the results of bacterial visit distribution map shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3B</xref>. Taken together, these results indicate that loss of <italic>pslG</italic> promotes microcolonies formation by changing the surface exploration of bacteria during microcolony formation, a phenomenon that has been reported mostly for strains producing a high level of PSL (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib47">Zhao et al., 2013</xref>).</p><fig-group><fig id="fig3" position="float"><label>Figure 3.</label><caption><title>Effects of <italic>pslG</italic> on the formation of microcolonies in flow-cell systems.</title><p>(A): Surface coverage maps at a total of 10,000, 50,000, and 100,000 bacterial visits for PAO1, Δ<italic>pslG</italic>, Δ<italic>pslG::pslG,</italic> and Δ<italic>pslG::pslG</italic><sub>E165Q,E276Q</sub> cells.

At 4 min after addition of exogenous PslG, the long chains of bacterial cells were seen clearly to start to be broken up, and they were completely disconnected into single cells after 12 min of PslG treatment (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5B</xref>) (<xref ref-type="video" rid="video4">Videos 4</xref> and <xref ref-type="video" rid="video5">5</xref>).

We then monitored the c-di-GMP level of cells for each cell division event by employing pCdrA<italic>::gfp</italic> as a reporter (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Irie et al., 2012</xref>). Cells with high c-di-GMP levels show strong fluorescence intensity as previously described (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Irie et al., 2012</xref>). We focused on the first bacterial division events after cells attached on the surface and analyzed the fluorescence intensity (corresponding to c-di-GMP levels) in two daughter cells right after division (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6A</xref>). By comparing the fluorescence intensity of each daughter cell relative to its mother cell, the division events can be classified into three types: none of the daughter cells becomes bright (none-bright), one daughter cell becomes bright (one-bright) and both of daughter cells become bright (two-bright). The results show that none-bright type is observed most frequently in all tested strains, which has an occurrence probability of ~ 60% for PAO1, ~ 58% for Δ<italic>pslG</italic>, and ~ 52% for P<sub>BAD</sub>-<italic>psl</italic>Δ<italic>pslG</italic>. Interestingly, both Δ<italic>pslG</italic> mutants show a relatively higher probability of two-bright type (~17% for P<sub>BAD</sub>-<italic>psl</italic>Δ<italic>pslG</italic> strain, ~ 16% for Δ<italic>pslG</italic> strain) than that of PAO1 (~11%) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6B</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6s1">Figure 6—figure supplement 1</xref>). In addition, the catalytic site mutated strains show a phenotype similar to Δ<italic>pslG</italic> strains, have a relatively higher probability of two-bright type (~19% for both Δ<italic>pslG::pslG</italic><sub>E165Q, E276Q</sub> and P<sub>BAD</sub>-<italic>psl</italic>Δ<italic>pslG::pslG</italic><sub>E165Q, E276Q</sub> strain) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6B</xref>). Thus, compared with PAO1, Δ<italic>pslG</italic> cells and bacterial cells with the catalytic site mutated PslG would have a higher probability to have both daughter cells with high c-di-GMP levels. During asymmetric divisions, daughter cells with high c-di-GMP levels keep staying on the surface and daughter cells with low c-di-GMP levels tend to move away (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Christen et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Laventie et al., 2019</xref>). Therefore, both daughter cells with high c-di-GMP levels might enhance bacterial stay on the surface and alter their movement pattern. In addition, a high level of c-di-GMP enhances PSL production. An earlier work has shown that cells form a microcolony through a PSL-based rich-get-richer mechanism (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib47">Zhao et al., 2013</xref>), during which founder cells can be very important. The cells of two-bright cases have high c-di-GMP levels and thus can act as founder cells to promote microcolony formation. Altogether, the slight change in c-di-GMP levels of daughter cells in <italic>pslG</italic> mutants can be likely one of reasons to promote the formation of microcolony and long bacterial chains.</p><fig-group><fig id="fig6" position="float"><label>Figure 6.</label><caption><title>Lacking of PslG or its hydrolytic activity has effects on the fate and c-di-GMP distribution of daughter cells.</title><p>(A): Three types of cell division based on fluorescence intensity changes of daughter cells relative to that of their mother cell: none of daughter cells becomes bright (none-bright), one daughter cell becomes bright (one-bright), and both daughter cells become bright (two-bright).

Earlier studies have shown that PslG is localized mainly on the inner membrane and a little in the periplasm (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib44">Wu et al., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Baker et al., 2015</xref>). It has been proposed that PslG on membrane hydrolyzes PSL polymer during biosynthesis to help the release of PSL at right time (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib44">Wu et al., 2019</xref>) and the portion in periplasm is to degrade any PSL accumulated in the periplasm space (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Baker et al., 2015</xref>). In this study, our results revealed that it is very important for <italic>P. aeruginosa</italic> and its communities to have a glycosyl hydrolase encoding gene, <italic>pslG</italic> within the polysaccharide synthesis gene cluster. Loss of PslG or its catalytic activity affects the properties and functions of PSL, including its localization and signaling. The consequence of these changes has two aspects. One is that phenotypically long chains of cells are formed. The long chains are not observed in strains with intact <italic>pslG</italic>. Such long chains seem not induced by the adherence on a surface as they can also be observed in liquid cultures. Rather, there are multiple lines of evidences to support that PSL is the main factor for the formation of long chains. Firstly, by adding PslG externally into cell cultures, long chains were observed to disassemble into single cells, presumably due to the hydrolysis of PSL by PslG as shown in literature (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib45">Yu et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Baker et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib46">Zhang et al., 2018</xref>). Secondly, such long chains are not observed in P<sub>BAD</sub>-<italic>psl</italic>Δ<italic>pslG</italic> when PSL production is not induced (under 0% arabinose). Thirdly, the fluorescence staining experiments also show that PSL are often localized around septa of cells, where daughter cells are supposed to be disconnected after division.</p><p>The other aspect as a consequence of the change in PSL due to the loss of PslG is that, at the molecular level, the probability of both daughter cells having a higher level of c-di-GMP than that of their mother cell in a division event is increased. The increased level of c-di-GMP then would result in reduced cell motility and promote cells to transit to biofilm style (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">Römling et al., 2013</xref>). This may also help cells to form long chains by reducing the breakage of chains due to reduced cell motility and increased PSL production.</p><p>As it is widely known that PSL plays a very important role in the biofilms of <italic>P. aeruginosa</italic>, then both aforementioned aspects would have an effect on the biofilm development at different stages. At the attachment stage, reduced swimming motility, which can be caused by the higher level of c-di-GMP, can contribute to the reduced surface attachment observed on microtiter surfaces. Long chains of cells may also contribute to the reduced swimming motility. However, under our experimental setup, we cannot measure the swimming of long chains in liquid cultures when they move toward to the air-liquid interface. After cells attach on a surface, both the formation of long chains and the increased level of c-di-GMP in two daughter cells will help both daughter cells to stay on the surface, and result in a more hierarchical bacterial visit distribution (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3</xref>), which then lead to an earlier formation of microcolony. As cells continue to grow and proliferate, such differences in cell behavior between Δ<italic>pslG</italic> and PAO1 finally result in matured biofilms with different structures as shown in pellicles formed at the air-liquid interface, where pellicles of Δ<italic>pslG</italic> are rougher than those of PAO1 although their biomasses are similar. We note that the aforementioned effect of <italic>pslG</italic> on the biofilm development is also dependent on the synthesis of PSL.</p><p>Thus, by revealing the important roles of PslG on bacterial physiology and the biofilm development, our results further expand our understandings of PslG functions. To the best of our knowledge, the ability of a glycosyl hydrolase to affect bacterial c-di-GMP levels has not been reported until this work. It would be also very interesting to see in the future whether other glycosyl hydrolases in different bacterial species can have similar functions.</p><p>Similarly, glycosyl hydrolase has also been found to be encoded in gene clusters that are involved in the synthesis of other exopolysaccharides. For example, <italic>algL</italic>, a gene within the alginate synthesis operon of <italic>P. aeruginosa</italic>, also encodes a lyase to degrade alginate (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Franklin et al., 2011</xref>). An early work showed that Δ<italic>algL</italic> in a CF isolate mucoid strain FRD1 results in cell death, due to accumulation of alginate in the periplasm (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Jain and Ohman, 2005</xref>). Interestingly, a later work showed that Δ<italic>algL</italic> in a PAO1-derived mucoid strain PDO300 does not cause cell death, yet increases alginate production (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib42">Wang et al., 2016</xref>). A recent study further revealed that the function of AlgL in PAO1 is to clear the periplasmic space of accumulated alginate during polymer biosynthesis, while lack of AlgL might inhibit bacterial growth under certain conditions (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Gheorghita et al., 2022</xref>). <italic>pelA</italic> is another example of encoding a hydrolase in the PEL synthesis operon (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Franklin et al., 2011</xref>), which has been shown to inhibit biofilm formation as that of PslG (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Baker et al., 2016</xref>). It would be interesting to investigate whether <italic>algL or pelA</italic> affects bacterial intracellular c-di-GMP levels.</p><p>In summary, in this study, we have provided a comprehensive analysis on the effect of <italic>pslG</italic> on the biofilm development of <italic>P. aeruginosa</italic>. Our results indicate that although <italic>pslG</italic> is not essential for synthesis of PSL, it plays an important role in regulating the proper functions of PSL, and loss of <italic>pslG</italic> or its hydrolytic activity results in malfunction of PSL, which then cause changes in both morphology and surface behavior of bacterial cells through PSL-mediated interactions. This work shed light on better understanding the role of PslG and would be helpful in developing new ways for biofilm control through <italic>pslG</italic>-based PSL regulation.</p></sec><sec id="s4"

What follows is the decision letter after the first round of review.]</p><p>Thank you for submitting the paper &quot;Intracellular glycosyl hydrolase PslG shapes bacterial cell fate, signaling, and the biofilm development of <italic>Pseudomonas aeruginosa</italic>&quot; for consideration by <italic>eLife</italic>. Your article has been reviewed by 3 peer reviewers, and the evaluation has been overseen by a Reviewing Editor and a Senior Editor. The following individuals involved in review of your submission have agreed to reveal their identity: Joe Jonathan Harrison (Reviewer #2).</p><p>Comments to the Authors:</p><p>We are sorry to say that, after consultation with the reviewers, we have decided that this work will not be considered further for publication by <italic>eLife</italic>.</p><p>While there was clear interest in the overall subject and the direction of the experimental approaches, the reviewers found multiple deficiencies in the overall experimental design that diminished the strength of the conclusions based on the data presented. Thus, the ability to complete numerous experiments needed to strengthen the data within 2 months is highly unlikely and serves as the basis for the decision. In particular the lack of trans-complemented strains or use of strains with point mutations in PslG raised issues about pleiotropic effects and specificity. Lack of building on prior work in the field and citing prior results on the alginate lyase, AlgL, which led to a similar phenotype, diminishes the claims to novelty and primacy. Also, the impact of two other surface polysaccharides, Pel and alginate was not explored. Most <italic>Pseudomonas aeruginosa</italic> strains make alginate at a low level, but PAO1 does not do so under aerobic conditions in vitro, so use of this strain as the major one to test the hypotheses and draw conclusions could represent findings not generally applicable to <italic>P. aeruginosa</italic>. Additional concerns about the interpretation of the Raman spectra and weaknesses in the data that support the conclusions regarding the basis for the effect of loss of PslG on the cellular structures further diminish the impact of the findings.</p><p><italic>Reviewer #1:</italic></p><p>The manuscript primarily presents phenotypic results to shape their story and conclusions. Given the importance of both Psl and Pel to exopolysaccharide-dependent behaviors in <italic>P. aeruginosa</italic> PAO1 (and many other strains), the potential importance and contribution of Pel is essentially ignored here. Because both Pel and Psl can generally influence several of the phenotypes explored in this manuscript, the authors' desire to draw specific conclusions from the effect of PslG cannot be separated from potential contributions of Pel polysaccharide in these experiments. Another difficulty in assessing the results and conclusions lies in the fact that some experiments utilize only the WFPA801ΔpslG or ΔpslG strains, which are inherently different (Figure 3 shows ΔpslG with PAO1 as a control while Figure 4 shows WFPA801ΔpslG with PAO1 as a control). Thus, there are two parallel lines of evidence that do not fully converge. In addition, as the pslG mutation is not complemented in any set of experiments, the specificity of pslG to the effects detailed here is not definitely demonstrated. There may be much to be learned by probing an arabinose-inducible pslG construct as the authors have done with overall Psl production.</p><p>The most compelling data in the manuscript involves the impact of pslG upon divided cells. Both the c-di-GMP reporter and cell-chain data point to a role of PslG in disposition of progeny. These results included in Figures 4, 6, and 7 are fascinating but require further probing to actually explain the role of PslG.</p><p>A deeper interrogation of cell division may uncover a direct connection between PslG and the cell cycle. Several other types of experiments may be useful to discern this connection.</p><p>The manuscript misses the opportunity to reference and build upon recent work by the Wozniak and Parsek labs on Pel and Psl (from just the last 6 years).</p><p>Line 116. From all of the descriptions here, the methods, and the figure 1 legend, it is not clear what has been quantified in Figure 1A as the measure of Psl.</p><p>Line 131. Even though the WFPA801ΔpslG strain shows a &quot;statistically significant&quot; decrease in swim zone diameter in comparison to WT or un-induced conditions, the difference is minor. Certainly, this strain exhibits flagellar motility. Given the small difference in flagellar motility, which is used here as an indirect assessment of flagellar function that may apply to surface attachment, it would be more prudent to conclude &quot;…the defect of ΔpslG on initial attachment MAY BE the result of multiple contributing factors.&quot;</p><p>Line 173. &quot;…by changing the surface exploration at early stages of biofilm formation…&quot; I disagree this is what the data show here and suggest this contradicts the data discussed lines 157-164 in the same paragraph where surface coverage differences are not apparent between pslG and PAO1 at N&lt;10,000. Indeed, it would be the impact of pslG upon the 10,000-100,000 range of visits that begs for further discernment. Or what is the working definition of &quot;early stages&quot; here?</p><p>Line 228. The Raman spectra of the three strains clearly show many differences in presence and intensity of numerous peaks between 800-1800 cm-1. In the absence of more specific and supportive references and other controls, it is not clear that the 865 cm-1 peak is the definitive feature between these three spectra nor is it clear this peak allows for the specific discernment of a 1,4-glycosidic linkage polysaccharide. Lastly, it is not clear how the authors can even discern Psl from Pel polysaccharide by Raman given the data presented here. There may be no &quot;structural change in Psl&quot; observed here but rather a shift from Psl to Pel.</p><p>Line 238. These results are difficult to interpret. If the ΔpslG strain makes less Psl, then how is the chain-forming phenotype dependent upon increased Psl production in the WFPA801ΔpslG strain?</p><p><italic>Reviewer #2:Pseudomonas aeruginosa</italic> is an opportunistic pathogen that is one of the leading causes of bacterial infection worldwide. The ability of this bacterium to form biofilms, which are aggregates of these microorganisms encased in a protective layer of polymers, is key for its ability to survive in different environments and cause disease. In this report, the role of a glycoside hydrolase enzyme, PslG, which is co-produced with more than a dozen other enzymes used by the bacteria to build their protective biofilm polymeric matrix, is investigated. The authors provide evidence that this enzyme determines cell fate in the early stages of <italic>P. aeruginosa</italic> biofilm formation by enabling cell detachment post-division. Understanding the natural functions of these enzymes is important because they comprise an emerging class of experimental therapeutics that target biofilms.The data presented by the authors in the manuscript are intriguing. However, the paper needs to be more carefully written because the impact will be tempered by the presentation. Understanding the natural role of glycoside hydrolases in biofilm development is a fundamental problem for the field that microbiologists have been pondering for more than a decade. Most of the conclusions are supported by data, but findings are not communicated as effectively as they could be, which detracts from what otherwise is a very nice dataset. There are some controls that are missing as well.</p><p>Key constructive criticisms</p><p>The authors should complete a complementation analysis for pslG in all their assays. As the authors note, the pslG gene is in an operon and so polar effects are a concern, and because pslG mutations appear pleiotropic, ensuring that phenotypes do not result from second site mutations elsewhere in the chromosome of engineered strains seems especially important.</p><p>To ensure that the hydrolase function of PslG is responsible for the observed phenotypes, it would be prudent to repeat some key assays in which the active site residues of PslG have been disrupted by site-directed mutagenesis.</p><p>Line 110-121. It is not clear what the authors are measuring and reporting in Figure 1A. In the text, the authors make statements about the quantities of ePSL produced by the different strains. However, the data in Figure 1 has no units and it is not clear whether the authors are measuring ePSL directly, or if the data represents something else. Could the authors quantify biofilm formation shown in the pictures below Figure 1A? Also, it would be highly beneficial if a semi-quantitation of the dot blots shown was provided too. Corresponding text should be added to the figure legend to succinctly explain the data presented in the figure.</p><p>Line 134-135. Could the authors better explain how the data led to their conclusion that PslG modulates surface attachment through multiple mechanisms? It is not clear from the text why the authors conclude that changes in motility are causally linked to defects in bacterial surface attachment, because the flagellum can be dispensable for biofilm formation depending on the assay. Also, the evidence here indicates that pslG mutations are pleiotropic.</p><p>Lines 228-234 and Figure 5 C. Caution needs to be applied using Raman spectroscopy on whole biofilms because the composition of biofilms is complex. How can the authors be certain that changes at 865 cm-1 correlate specifically with a glycosidic link in ePSL? There has been a demonstration that deletion of pslG affects intracellular c-di-GMP which influences many things in physiology including multiple components of the <italic>P. aeruginosa</italic> biofilm matrix. The authors would need to purify PSL from the WFPA801 and WFPA801 pslG strains and analyze that material to make these conclusions with confidence.</p><p>Lines 212-227 and Figure 5A and B. Why isn't data for the pslG mutant also included in Figure 5A?</p><p>Lines 276-277. In this case, &quot;data not shown&quot; is not acceptable because the WFPA801 and WFPA801 pslG are engineered to have artificially high levels of PSL production. The data that are not shown correspond to key information corroborating physiological relevance to the wild type background. Please add these data to the manuscript.</p><p><italic>Reviewer #3:</italic></p><p>In this manuscript, the authors investigated the role of PslG, a <italic>Pseudomonas aeruginosa</italic> glycosyl hydrolase, in biofilm formation and cell physiology of a <italic>P. aeruginosa</italic>. PslG is encoded on the 15 gene psl operon, and a previous study indicated that deletion of pslG caused reduced ePSL (extracellular PSL polysaccharide) production. However, in the previous study, the pslG deletion may have been polar on other downstream psl genes and may have affected ePSL production. Therefore, in this study the investigators constructed a pslG deletion in a strain where the entire psl operon is controlled by the arabinose-inducible promoter. In this way, ePSL is produced but the operon lacks pslG. The investigators showed that in this strain, ePSL is produced at levels similar to the wild-type strain. However, the pslG deletion strain had several phenotypic defects that suggested a functional role of the glycosyl hydrolase. Among the defects was a reduction in biofilm formation, even when ePSL was produced, and a reduction in swimming motility. The investigators also used microscopic tracking of the cells, and noticed a reduction in surface area covered, likely due to clumping of the cells. The clumping of the cells was due to their formation of cell chains, which were not observed in the wild-type strain or in the new strain, when ePSL production was not induced with arabinose. Interestingly, the investigators noted that in the cells that were unable to separate following division (cell chains) had ePSL accumulated at the boarders between the cells. The chains could be released by adding exogenous PslG enzyme to the cultures. The investigators suggested that in the absence of PslG, the ePSL may accumulate at the cell boarders, holding the daughter cells together. In addition to these phenotypes, the investigators also noticed a difference in the production of the cyclic-di-GMP signaling molecule in the pslG mutant strain. Since c-di-GMP is an important signaling molecule for biofilm production, the investigators put forth a model for the role of PslG in c-di_GMP signaling in the development of <italic>P. aeruginosa</italic> biofilms.</p><p>Overall, I think this is a thorough study and the results are well presented. A weakness of this study (in my opinion) is that while adequately exploring the phenotypes of the PslG mutant in an ePSL producing strain, a functional role for PslG in polysaccharide degradation during ePSL biosynthesis is not adequately developed. The model in Figure 8 (and the abstract) implies that the role of PslG is through c-di-GMP signaling molecule. However, the data in Figure 4B and Figure 5B show only a minor effect of the pslG deletion on c-di-GMP signaling. In Figure 4B, most cells are classified as &quot;none-bright&quot; in both the experimental and control strain. Only a minor percentage of cells are classified as &quot;two-bright&quot;. The difference in &quot;two-bright&quot; between the control and experimental in Figure 4B, although statistically different, is not a high percentage of the total cells. Figure 5A shows a moderate difference in c-di-GMP production as indicated by a reporter gene. However, Figure 5A does not include a growth curve, so the difference seen in fluorescence could be due to a difference in cell numbers/growth. This would not be surprising, given the many physiological defects of the pslG mutant. (a growth curve needs to be shown to determine if the fluorescence difference is due to cell growth differences). The model in Figure 8 implies that c-di-GMP signaling (and the &quot;two-bright&quot; daughter cells) is the primary signaling event for biofilm formation in the pslG mutant. In my opinion, this is overstated, given the minor effect of the pslG mutation on c-di-GMP production. As far as I know, PslG does not have a c-di-GMP binding domain, so it is difficult to draw a molecular link between the pslG mutant and c-di-GFP. The slight increase in c-di-GMP in the mutant cells may be due to an indirect effect of an overall stress response in the mutant cell, and not a direct signaling mechanism.</p><p>I recommend that the authors read and cite the publication, &quot;Role of an alginate lyase for alginate transport in mucoid <italic>Pseudomonas aeruginosa</italic>&quot; Infect Immun. 2005 Oct;73(10):6429-36.doi: 10.1128/IAI.73.10.6429-6436.2005.</p><p>In the discussion, the authors state, &quot;To the best of our knowledge, the ability of a</p><p>glycosyl hydrolase to affect bacterial phenotype and c-di-GMP levels has not been</p><p>reported until this work. It would be also very interesting to see in the future whether</p><p>other glycosyl hydrolases in different bacterial species can have similar functions.&quot;</p><p>In the paper above, the authors characterized another glycosyl hydrolase from <italic>Pseudomonas aeruginosa</italic>, that degrades alginate, and is encoded on the alginate biosynthetic operon (so, a very similar model system). In that study, the authors found that deletion of algL in an alginate producing strain resulted in cell death, due to accumulation of alginate in the periplasm. There is a precedence for these types of studies. The mechanism for PslG may be different from AlgL (and the PslG deletion obviously doesn't kill the bacteria), but the AlgL study could provide a hypothesis on the molecular role of PslG. In addition, both AlgL and PslG reside in the periplasm (assuming the model in reference: Frontiers in Microbiology 2:167 is correct). The authors of the current study only mention the periplasmic location for PslG in the Discussion section. The implication in the present study is that PslG is secreted. If PslG is secreted, there should be evidence for that (or a citation that shows that it is secreted). The localization of this enzyme could be crucial in understanding its function.</p><p>[Editors’ note: further revisions were suggested prior to acceptance, as described below.]</p><p>Thank you for resubmitting your work entitled &quot;Intracellular glycosyl hydrolase PslG shapes bacterial cell fate, signaling, and the biofilm development of <italic>Pseudomonas aeruginosa</italic>&quot; for further consideration by <italic>eLife</italic>.

The most compelling data in the manuscript involves the impact of pslG upon divided cells. Truly fascinating. However, it is not clear that the authors demonstrate the importance of PslG to &quot;normal&quot; cell division and/or how Psl polysaccharide might contribute to cell division in the wild-type. There is no basis in the literature to suggest that pslG mutations would be common in select environments.</p><p>Several new lines of experimental evidence have been added to the manuscript in this revised form and these changes are a great collective improvement-but the true role(s) and effect of PslG are still not clear from the evidence presented.</p><p>There are several sentences where the English syntax and grammar require editing.</p><p>Line 159.

Given the small variation in the data shown in Figure 6B, support for this statement really requires specific testing. Further, not all previous data in the manuscript support it. The text in an earlier section (starting line 213) effectively concludes that there is no quantifiable motility difference between these strains.</p><p>Line 497. The Psl staining with TRITC-HHA is specific to Psl? Is there binding to Pel or other polysaccharides?</p><p>Line 770. The Figure 1 title is not the best description of what is shown here.

PslG encodes a glyocoside hydrolase. While the biochemistry of this enzyme has been understood for many years, its physiologically relevant role in <italic>P. aeruginosa</italic> biofilm formation has remained ill-defined.</p><p>The experiments in the manuscript have been meticulously executed. There are controls and complementation analyses that provide confidence in the results obtained. The technical proficiency with microscopy is commendable. However, while the authors provide a data-rich manuscript, an understanding of the consequences of PslG expression appears lacking beyond phenotyping.</p><p>Perhaps this criticism is most pertinent to the observed changes in the power-law distribution for bacteria during the earliest stages of biofilm formation for pslG mutants. Interpretation/experimentation is absent that connects these observations to social biology. Such connections, which are front and center in prior work published by one of the co-authors (Dr. Khun Zhao), could help to explain conservation of glycoside hydrolases among synthase-dependent exopolysaccharide secretion systems like the Psl synthase. For example, beyond the careful phenotyping presented in this paper, co-culture of Pbad-Psl with Pbad-Psl-PslG strains, or perhaps wild type and pslG strains, that have been uniquely labelled with fluorescent proteins and tracked using Dr. Kun Zhao's elegant single-cell methods could directly demonstrate fitness changes for pslG mutants in surface exploration or colonization relative to wild type. In principle, wouldn't such a fitness cost provide an explanation for PslG function that is rooted in social evolutionary theory? Perhaps there are some trade-offs that aren't yet apparent. The link to c-di-GMP signaling provides some molecular insight even the sensory perception and signal transduction pathway is not yet fully known. Such analyses could take the work assembled here to the next level with little additional experimental effort, and as such, strikes me as a missed opportunity to provide significant, additional understanding of some really nice data.</p></body></sub-article><sub-article article-type="reply" id="sa2"><front-stub><article-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.72778.sa2</article-id><title-group><article-title>Author response</article-title></title-group></front-stub><body><p>[Editors’ note: The authors appealed the original decision.

Given the importance of both Psl and Pel to exopolysaccharide-dependent behaviors in <italic>P. aeruginosa</italic> PAO1 (and many other strains), the potential importance and contribution of Pel is essentially ignored here. Because both Pel and Psl can generally influence several of the phenotypes explored in this manuscript, the authors' desire to draw specific conclusions from the effect of PslG cannot be separated from potential contributions of Pel polysaccharide in these experiments.</p></disp-quote><p>We agree with Reviewer #1 that both PSL and PEL are important to exopolysaccharide-dependent behavior of PAO1. In the revised manuscript, we have added more text about PEL and alginate in the introduction part (See L60-L66).</p><p>Based on literature results (for example, Colvin et al., 2012, Environmental Microbiology), PAO1 is a PSL-dominant strain, whose biofilm formation is mainly dependent on PSL. Thus, we speculate that PEL may have little contribution to the phenotypes of <italic>pslG</italic> mutants observed in this work. Following suggestions of reviewers, we have added the results of PEL-negative strain as well as <italic>pslG</italic> deletion in PEL-negative background in the revised manuscript (see Figure 3—figure supplement 3 and Figure 5—figure supplement 3).

PslG is encoded on the 15 gene psl operon, and a previous study indicated that deletion of pslG caused reduced ePSL (extracellular PSL polysaccharide) production. However, in the previous study, the pslG deletion may have been polar on other downstream psl genes and may have affected ePSL production. Therefore, in this study the investigators constructed a pslG deletion in a strain where the entire psl operon is controlled by the arabinose-inducible promoter. In this way, ePSL is produced but the operon lacks pslG. The investigators showed that in this strain, ePSL is produced at levels similar to the wild-type strain. However, the pslG deletion strain had several phenotypic defects that suggested a functional role of the glycosyl hydrolase. Among the defects was a reduction in biofilm formation, even when ePSL was produced, and a reduction in swimming motility. The investigators also used microscopic tracking of the cells, and noticed a reduction in surface area covered, likely due to clumping of the cells. The clumping of the cells was due to their formation of cell chains, which were not observed in the wild-type strain or in the new strain, when ePSL production was not induced with arabinose. Interestingly, the investigators noted that in the cells that were unable to separate following division (cell chains) had ePSL accumulated at the boarders between the cells. The chains could be released by adding exogenous PslG enzyme to the cultures. The investigators suggested that in the absence of PslG, the ePSL may accumulate at the cell boarders, holding the daughter cells together. In addition to these phenotypes, the investigators also noticed a difference in the production of the cyclic-di-GMP signaling molecule in the pslG mutant strain. Since c-di-GMP is an important signaling molecule for biofilm production, the investigators put forth a model for the role of PslG in c-di_GMP signaling in the development of <italic>P. aeruginosa</italic> biofilms.</p><p>Overall, I think this is a thorough study and the results are well presented.</p></disp-quote><p>We thank Reviewer #3 for his/her positive comments.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>A weakness of this study (in my opinion) is that while adequately exploring the phenotypes of the PslG mutant in an ePSL producing strain, a functional role for PslG in polysaccharide degradation during ePSL biosynthesis is not adequately developed. The model in Figure 8 (and the abstract) implies that the role of PslG is through c-di-GMP signaling molecule. However, the data in Figure 4B and Figure 5B show only a minor effect of the pslG deletion on c-di-GMP signaling. In Figure 4B, most cells are classified as &quot;none-bright&quot; in both the experimental and control strain. Only a minor percentage of cells are classified as &quot;two-bright&quot;. The difference in &quot;two-bright&quot; between the control and experimental in Figure 4B, although statistically different, is not a high percentage of the total cells. Figure 5A shows a moderate difference in c-di-GMP production as indicated by a reporter gene. However, Figure 5A does not include a growth curve, so the difference seen in fluorescence could be due to a difference in cell numbers/growth. This would not be surprising, given the many physiological defects of the pslG mutant. (a growth curve needs to be shown to determine if the fluorescence difference is due to cell growth differences). The model in Figure 8 implies that c-di-GMP signaling (and the &quot;two-bright&quot; daughter cells) is the primary signaling event for biofilm formation in the pslG mutant. In my opinion, this is overstated, given the minor effect of the pslG mutation on c-di-GMP production. As far as I know, PslG does not have a c-di-GMP binding domain, so it is difficult to draw a molecular link between the pslG mutant and c-di-GFP. The slight increase in c-di-GMP in the mutant cells may be due to an indirect effect of an overall stress response in the mutant cell, and not a direct signaling mechanism.</p></disp-quote><p>We thank the reviewer for his/her comments.</p><p>– We have measured the growth of strains, and the results show a similar growth of WT, <italic>∆pslG</italic>, and ΔP<sub>psl</sub>.

The results of growth curves have been added in Figure 7A and C in the revised manuscript (Figure 5 in the original version has been modified and renumbered to be Figure 7 in the revised manuscript). Based on the growth measurement, we can conclude that the observed differences in c-di-GMP in Figure 7 is not due to the growth difference of strains.

In fact, in Figure 8, we didn’t mean what the reviewer commented that “<italic>the role of PslG is through c-di-GMP signaling molecule.”</italic> nor mean that “<italic>c-di-GMP signaling (and the &quot;two-bright&quot; daughter cells) is the primary signaling event for biofilm formation in the pslG mutant.</italic>” What we would like to convey in Figure 8 is that PslG can affect the phenotype and c-di-GMP levels through PSL-mediated pathways, which then affect biofilm development.</p><p>– Psl has been shown to be able to act as a signaling substance to stimulate biofilm formation through affecting c-di-GMP (Irie et al., 2012). So by modifying Psl, PslG can indirectly affect c-di-GMP levels, which we believe is what has been happening in this study. There are multiple lines of evidence to support this. First, PslG can degrade PSL, which has been shown in literature. Second, in this study, the results of <italic>∆pslG</italic> and <italic>pslG</italic> with hydrolytic active site mutation indicate that PSL without the cutting of PslG shows a stronger signaling property (see Figure 6 and Figure 7A and B). In addition, we also examined the signaling property of PSL with or without PslG treatment. As shown in Figure 7C and D, PslG treatment significantly reduces the signaling property of PSL.</p><p>– In the revised manuscript, to better convey our point, we have modified Figure 8 to be clearer on the role of PslG by modifying the text to be “shapes PSL localization” and “enhances PSL signaling function” in the figure.</p><p>– In this study, after we checked the c-di-GMP levels of two daughter cells after cell division, the results show that there is an increase in the proportion of the case of “two-bright”, although the value of two-bright case is still minor compared to that of none-bright case. But even the number of two-bright case is small, they can play an important role in the microcolony formation. Earlier work has shown that cells form a microcolony through a PSL-based rich-get-richer mechanism (Zhao et al., 2013), during which founder cells can be very important. The cells of two-bright case have high c-di-GMP levels and thus can act as founder cells to promote microcolony formation. Therefore, the slight change in c-di-GMP levels of daughter cells in <italic>∆pslG</italic> can affect the microcolony formation.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>I recommend that the authors read and cite the publication, &quot;Role of an alginate lyase for alginate transport in mucoid <italic>Pseudomonas aeruginosa</italic>&quot; Infect Immun. 2005 Oct;73(10):6429-36.doi: 10.1128/IAI.73.10.6429-6436.2005.</p><p>In the discussion, the authors state, &quot;To the best of our knowledge, the ability of a</p><p>glycosyl hydrolase to affect bacterial phenotype and c-di-GMP levels has not been</p><p>reported until this work.

In that study, the authors found that deletion of algL in an alginate producing strain resulted in cell death, due to accumulation of alginate in the periplasm. There is a precedence for these types of studies. The mechanism for PslG may be different from AlgL (and the PslG deletion obviously doesn't kill the bacteria), but the AlgL study could provide a hypothesis on the molecular role of PslG. In addition, both AlgL and PslG reside in the periplasm (assuming the model in reference: Frontiers in Microbiology 2:167 is correct). The authors of the current study only mention the periplasmic location for PslG in the Discussion section. The implication in the present study is that PslG is secreted. If PslG is secreted, there should be evidence for that (or a citation that shows that it is secreted). The localization of this enzyme could be crucial in understanding its function.</p></disp-quote><p>We thank the reviewer for his/her thoughtful comments. In the revised manuscript, we have added more discussions on <italic>algL</italic>. Please find at L405 – L414: “<italic>algL</italic> is a gene within the alginate synthesis operon of <italic>P. aeruginosa</italic> (Franklin et al., 2011). Interestingly, <italic>algL</italic> also encode a lyase to degrade alginate. An early work showed that Δ<italic>algL</italic> in a CF isolate mucoid strain FRD1 resulted in cell death, due to accumulation of alginate in the periplasm (Jain et al. 2005). However, a later work showed that Δ<italic>algL</italic> in a PAO1-derived mucoid strain PDO300 did not cause cell death, yet increase alginate production (Wang et al. 2016). <italic>pelA</italic> is the first gene in PEL synthesis operon, which also encodes a hydrolase (Franklin et al., 2011) that has been shown to inhibit biofilm formation as that of PslG (Baker et al., 2016). It would be interesting to investigate whether <italic>algL</italic> or <italic>pelA</italic> affects bacterial intracellular c-di-GMP levels”.</p><p>Regarding on the localization of PslG, in an earlier work of Wu et al. 2019 published in <italic>MicrobiologyOpen</italic>, results have shown that PslG is localized mainly in the inner membrane and some in the periplasm. PslG is only released into extracellular when bacteria are dead. Such information has been added in the introduction part in the revised manuscript (L78-80 and L88-93).</p><p>[Editors’ note: what follows is the authors’ response to the second round of review.]</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>The manuscript has been improved but there are some remaining issues that need to be addressed, as outlined below:</p><p>Reviewer #1:</p><p>The manuscript seeks to delineate the role of pslG, a glycosyl hydrolase encoded within an operon that enables the production of the Psl polysaccharide of the bacterium <italic>Pseudomonas aeruginosa</italic>. The results in the manuscript show numerous effects using a combination of pslG mutants and over-expression strains upon <italic>P. aeruginosa</italic> behavior important to colonization and biofilm development. This adds to our understanding of the multi-functional enzymes involved in regulating polysaccharide production and the overall behavior of <italic>P. aeruginosa</italic>.</p><p>The manuscript primarily presents phenotypic results to shape their story and conclusions. Given the importance of both Psl and Pel to exopolysaccharide-dependent behaviors in <italic>P. aeruginosa</italic> PAO1 (and many other strains), the potential importance and contribution of Pel remains essentially ignored in this manuscript. Because both Pel and Psl can generally influence several of the phenotypes explored in this manuscript, the authors' desire to draw specific conclusions from the effect of PslG cannot be separated from potential contributions of Pel polysaccharide in these experiments.</p></disp-quote><p>This comment is the same as the one in the previous round. As we stated in our replies in the previous round “Based on literature results (for example, Colvin et al, 2012, Environmental Microbiology), PAO1 is a PSL-dominant strain, whose biofilm formation is mainly dependent on PSL. Thus, we speculate that PEL may have little contribution to the phenotypes of pslG mutants observed in this work.” More importantly, we constructed and tested PEL negative strains in either PAO1 or PslG mutant background, and found that all phenotypes of pslG mutants are still observed in PEL-negative strains. These results have already been shown in Figure 1-Figure supplement 1C, Figure 3-Figure supplement 3, and Figure 5-Figure supplement 3 in the previous version of manuscript. Taken together, all these results suggest that Pel polysaccharide has little contribution on the phenotypes observed in this study (the corresponding text can be found at L277-282 in the previous revision, L280-288 in this revision). Therefore, we could not agree with the comment about “the potential importance and contribution of Pel remains essentially ignored in this manuscript.”.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>The story is certainly complicated as study of pslG mutants does affect levels of Psl polysaccharide.</p></disp-quote><p>Our very first experiment shown in Figure 1A is to tell that the level of PSL polysaccharide is not likely the reason to cause those phenotypes of <italic>pslG</italic> mutants. In the revised manuscript, to make this point clearer, we have revised the subtitle as “Δ<italic>pslG</italic> strains cannot form rings on microtiter dish wells even when PSL production is induced to the wild type level.” (L116-117).</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>The most compelling data in the manuscript involves the impact of pslG upon divided cells. Truly fascinating.</p></disp-quote><p>We thank the reviewer for the positive comment!</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>However, it is not clear that the authors demonstrate the importance of PslG to &quot;normal&quot; cell division and/or how Psl polysaccharide might contribute to cell division in the wild-type. There is no basis in the literature to suggest that pslG mutations would be common in select environments.</p></disp-quote><p>We think PSL polysaccharide might not interfere with “normal” cell division in wild type. It may affect cell division only in some circumstances where PSL could not be hydrolyzed by PslG and hence cannot be released properly, such as in pslG deletion background.</p><p>The reviewer is right that there has been no literature so far (to the best of our knowledge) to suggest that pslG mutations would be common in select environments. The E165Q, E276Q mutation of PslG is a mutation that causes PslG to loss its hydrolase activity. We used this mutant to further confirm the importance of the cutting of PslG during PSL polysaccharide synthesis.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Several new lines of experimental evidence have been added to the manuscript in this revised form and these changes are a great collective improvement-but the true role(s) and effect of PslG are still not clear from the evidence presented.</p></disp-quote><p>We thank the reviewer for the comment. Here it is not clear for us what the reviewer means by saying “true role(s)”.</p><p>In this study, we showed that lacking of PslG or its hydrolytic activity in PAO1 enhances the signaling function of PSL, changes the relative level of cyclic-di-GMP within daughter cells during cell division and shapes the localization of PSL on bacterial periphery, thus results in long chains of bacterial cells, fast-forming biofilm microcolonies. We believe these results have revealed the important roles and effects of PslG on the cell morphology and cell activities such as biofilm development. However, to reveal the exact mechanisms at the molecular level, more studies are needed, and we hope our work can inspire more future studies in this direction.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>There are several sentences where the English syntax and grammar require editing.</p></disp-quote><p>We thank the reviewer for the comment.

There does not appear to be fewer bacterial cells in the pslG biofilms-and no quantification is given to support this statement.</p></disp-quote><p>From Figure 2D, it can clearly be seen that there are less green fluorescence signals in pslG mutant biofilms than in PAO1. As the fluorescence signal is from each bacterial cell, less fluorescence signal in pslG mutant biofilms corresponds to fewer bacterial cells in it. As this is qualitatively clear, we don’t think it is necessary to do the quantitative measurement for this particular statement. In addition, for quantitative measurements, we have shown the total biomass and thickness in Figure 2B. The results show that pslG mutant has a higher maximum thickness, yet a similar total biomass compared with PAO1. Thus, we can deduce that on average pslG mutant would have less number of bacterial cells than PAO1 for each section of biofilms (such as shown in Figure 2D), which is consistent with the qualitative observation of Figure 2D.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Line 178. &quot;…a more hierarchical bacterial visit distribution for pslG…&quot; It is not clear how this shows hierarchical visitors or a broad range of visit frequencies.

In Figure 3B, the number of bacterial visits is color-coded, with cyan color standing for 1000 bacterial visits and black color standing for 0 bacterial visit. Comparing the bacterial visit distribution between PAO1 and D<italic>pslG</italic> mutant, we can see that the bacterial visit distribution is more non-uniform in D<italic>pslG</italic> than in PAO1; Under the same total bacterial visits (<italic>N</italic>~ 100000), D<italic>pslG</italic> displays several concentrated patches with green-yellowish to cyan-like which stand for about 200~1000 bacterial visits and large blackish regions which have near zero bacterial visits, while PAO1 displays a large portion of surface with red-like colors which stand for ~ 100 bacterial visits. Quantitatively, the maximum of bacterial visit number for D<italic>pslG</italic> is higher than that in PAO1, and the power law exponent of bacterial visit distribution is also less negative for D<italic>pslG</italic> than for PAO1, so D<italic>pslG</italic> has a more hierarchical bacterial visit distribution.

In this study, microcolonies are defined as clusters of more than 30 cells. For clusters, we used a minimum distance criterion to judge whether a cell belonged to a cluster or not.

The images shown in Figure 3F were taken after 10 hours’ growth in a flow cell, while those shown in Figure 2 are confocal laser scanning microscope images of pellicles grown on air-liquid interface.

They can be considered as projection views of a slab sample (the thickness of the slab is closely related to the depth of field of the equipment, which is about 0.54 micron under our set-up).

In the revised manuscript, we have modified the sentence to be “Tracking GFP-tagged bacteria in a flow cell also showed that the PAO1 biofilms covered more surface (Video 1 and Figure 3F) and ΔpslG cells tended to form microcolonies with strong fluorescence intensity (Video 2 and Figure 3F), suggesting that bacteria were packed within microcolonies.

Since WT cells don’t show long chains, we just show the distribution of cell chains in two pslG mutants. But we didn’t mean to compare between different strains. From the distribution of cell chains, we can see that the cell chains consisting of four cells are observed most frequently among all observed chains.

Following that, we have modified the text to make it be more appropriate given the results that we obtained in this study. In the revised manuscript, the sentence is now to be: “During asymmetric divisions, daughter cells with high c-di-GMP levels keep staying on the surface and daughter cells with low c-di-GMP levels tend to move away (Christen et al., 2010; Laventie et al., 2019). Therefore, both daughter cells with high c-di-GMP levels might enhance bacterial stay on the surface and alter their movement pattern. In addition, a high level of c-di-GMP enhances PSL production. An earlier work has shown that cells form a microcolony through a PSL-based rich-get-richer mechanism (Zhao et al., 2013), during which founder cells can be very important. The cells of two-bright cases have high c-di-GMP levels and thus can act as founder cells to promote microcolony formation. Altogether, the slight change in c-di-GMP levels of daughter cells in pslG mutants can be likely one of reasons to promote the formation of microcolony and long bacterial chains.” (L312-323).</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Line 497.

The definitions of microcolony (lines 185-186) and cluster (lines 568-572) have been stated in the text. The microcolonies outlined with dashed lines in Figure 3 are all determined based on these definitions. Particularly, in this study whether or not a cell belongs to a cluster is judged by a minimum distance criterion. We note that this criterion does not mean that cells need to be most densely packed inside a cluster. For example, for the outlined microcolony of P<sub>BAD</sub>-<italic>psl</italic> in the Figure 3—figure supplement 1A, each of cells along the dashed outline has at least one neighboring cell that is within the distance of 0.5µm of the cell (i.e. meets the requirement of minimum distance criterion) and belongs to the cluster. But there is a clear empty (free of cells) region enclosed by cells inside the microcolony. How dense a microcolony can be will depend on multiple factors including cell motility, cell growth and the incubation time etc.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Reviewer #2:</p><p>The manuscript by Zhang and colleagues carefully describes the phenotypes of pslG mutants of <italic>P. aeruginosa</italic>.

Our manuscript reveals at least one mechanism beyond phenotyping, which is the hydrolysis of PslG on PSL during biosynthesis can change the signaling function of PSL and shape the localization of PSL on bacterial periphery, leading to a higher portion of bacterial cells that are not able to go asymmetric divisions, which may become the founder cells for microcolonies formation, and finally resulting in long bacterial chains as well as the change of bacterial surface explore patterns. We have added several sentences to describe this point (See L321-323). We have also revised the last paragraph of result section (L312-323).</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Perhaps this criticism is most pertinent to the observed changes in the power-law distribution for bacteria during the earliest stages of biofilm formation for pslG mutants. Interpretation/experimentation is absent that connects these observations to social biology. Such connections, which are front and center in prior work published by one of the co-authors (Dr. Khun Zhao), could help to explain conservation of glycoside hydrolases among synthase-dependent exopolysaccharide secretion systems like the Psl synthase. For example, beyond the careful phenotyping presented in this paper, co-culture of Pbad-Psl with Pbad-Psl-PslG strains, or perhaps wild type and pslG strains, that have been uniquely labelled with fluorescent proteins and tracked using Dr. Kun Zhao's elegant single-cell methods could directly demonstrate fitness changes for pslG mutants in surface exploration or colonization relative to wild type. In principle, wouldn't such a fitness cost provide an explanation for PslG function that is rooted in social evolutionary theory? Perhaps there are some trade-offs that aren't yet apparent. The link to c-di-GMP signaling provides some molecular insight even the sensory perception and signal transduction pathway is not yet fully known. Such analyses could take the work assembled here to the next level with little additional experimental effort, and as such, strikes me as a missed opportunity to provide significant, additional understanding of some really nice data.</p></disp-quote><p>We thank Reviewer #2 for the suggestions.
