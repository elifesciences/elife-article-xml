(HGT) provides a major source of genetic variation. Many viruses, including poxviruses, encode genes with crucial functions directly gained by gene transfer from hosts. The mechanism of transfer to poxvirus genomes is unknown. Using genome analysis and experimental screens of infected cells, we discovered a central role for Long Interspersed Nuclear Element-1 retrotransposition in HGT to virus genomes. The process recapitulates processed pseudogene generation, but with host messenger RNA directed into virus genomes. Intriguingly, hallmark features of retrotransposition appear to favor virus adaption through rapid duplication of captured host genes on arrival. Our study reveals a previously unrecognized conduit of genetic traffic with fundamental implications for the evolution of many virus classes and their hosts.</p></abstract><kwd-group kwd-group-type="author-keywords"><kwd>vaccinia virus</kwd><kwd>horizontal gene transfer</kwd><kwd>adaptive evolution</kwd><kwd>poxvirus</kwd></kwd-group><kwd-group kwd-group-type="research-organism"><title>Research organism</title><kwd>Human</kwd><kwd>Viruses</kwd></kwd-group><funding-group><award-group id="fund1"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000002</institution-id><institution>National Institutes of Health</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>R35GM134936</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Elde</surname><given-names>Nels C</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund2"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000002</institution-id><institution>National Institutes of Health</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>T32GM007464</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Fixsen</surname><given-names>Sarah M</given-names></name><name><surname>Sasani</surname><given-names>Thomas A</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund3"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000002</institution-id><institution>National Institutes of Health</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>T32AI055434</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Cone</surname><given-names>Kelsey R</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund4"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000861</institution-id><institution>Burroughs Wellcome Fund</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>1015462</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Elde</surname><given-names>Nels C</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund5"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100007747</institution-id><institution>University of Utah</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>HA and Edna Benning Presidential Endowed Chair</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Elde</surname><given-names>Nels C</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund6"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000002</institution-id><institution>National Institutes of Health</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>R01AI146915</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Rothenburg</surname><given-names>Stefan</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><funding-statement>The funders had no role in study design, data collection and interpretation, or the decision to submit the work for publication.</funding-statement></funding-group><custom-meta-group><custom-meta specific-use="meta-only"><meta-name>Author impact statement</meta-name><meta-value>Active selfish genetic elements in infected cells aid virus adaptation by catalyzing the transfer of host genes to virus genomes.</meta-value></custom-meta></custom-meta-group></article-meta></front><body><sec id="s1" sec-type="intro"><title>Introduction</title><p>The movement of genetic material from one organism to another by horizontal gene transfer (HGT) bypasses vertical inheritance from parent to offspring (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Keeling and Palmer, 2008</xref>). HGT can shortcut more gradual mutational processes by providing the opportunity for adaptive leaps through single mutational events where genes can be transferred between genomes across kingdoms of life (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Keeling and Palmer, 2008</xref>). HGT plays a central role in the diversification of many infectious microbes, which contend with complex environments and host immune defenses to persist and replicate. HGT is particularly well-described in bacteria, where it can contribute to the emerging crisis of multi-antibiotic resistant pathogens (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib44">Wijayawardena et al., 2013</xref>).</p><p>Many classes of viruses acquire genes from the hosts they infect by horizontal transfer (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Caprari et al., 2015</xref>). A conspicuous example is Rous Sarcoma virus, in which recognition of the horizontal transfer of the host c-<italic>Src</italic> gene into the virus genome led to the discovery of oncogenes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib43">Swanstrom et al., 1983</xref>). Other co-opted host genes diverge to aid the virus in inhibiting host defenses (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Kawagishi-Kobayashi et al., 1997</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Elde and Malik, 2009</xref>). It has become increasingly clear that the acquisition of host genes is a common mechanism by which viruses of many classes gain adaptive advantages to propagate (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Dolja and Koonin, 2018</xref>). Despite the prevalence of HGT in diverse viruses and its importance in virus evolution, the mechanisms by which genes are transferred from host to virus genomes are not well understood.</p><p>To investigate mechanisms of transfer we examined poxviruses, which encode a plethora of genes gained by horizontal transfer. Based on phylogenetic analysis, more than 25% of poxvirus genes were acquired by HGT from hosts (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Hughes and Friedman, 2005</xref>), although similarities not evident in sequence comparisons but revealed by shared protein structures suggest that a higher proportion of genes were acquired by horizontal transfer (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Bahar et al., 2011</xref>). Many captured genes adapt to act as inhibitors of host immune defenses to favor virus replication (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Elde and Malik, 2009</xref>). Some act as host range factors because their deletion leads to restriction of infectible cell types or species, implying that new acquisitions may aid in host jumps (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Bratke et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Haller et al., 2014</xref>). While the most notorious poxvirus, variola virus which caused smallpox, has been eradicated, other extant poxviruses are capable of infecting humans and pose the risk of new pandemics, as appears to be the case for monkeypox (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib42">Sklenovská and Van Ranst, 2018</xref>). Poxviruses also serve as useful model systems for other viruses with large double-stranded (ds) DNA genomes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Deeg et al., 2018</xref>).</p><p>Because poxvirus-encoded copies of host genes lack introns, it was hypothesized that transfer occurs through a spliced mRNA intermediate (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Lefkowitz et al., 2006</xref>). For integration, mRNA templates need to be reverse transcribed into virus genomes by either a retrovirus or a retrotransposon. The discovery of a provirus encoded in the genome of fowlpox virus (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Hertig et al., 1997</xref>) and a Short Interspersed Nuclear Element (SINE) retrotransposon found in the taterapox virus genome (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">Piskurek and Okada, 2007</xref>) indicate that either is capable of catalyzing insertions in poxvirus genomes.</p><p>Given differences in biochemical activity, it is possible to detect patterns distinguishing mechanisms of retroviral versus retrotransposon-based transfer of host genes into virus genomes. Long Interspersed Nuclear Element-1 (LINE-1) retrotransposons are known to reverse transcribe and integrate host genes in a sequence independent manner, resulting in collections of processed pseudogenes in diverse host genomes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Esnault et al., 2000</xref>). LINE-1 transcripts encode two proteins: an RNA binding protein (ORF1) and an endonuclease (EN)/reverse transcriptase (RT) protein (ORF2). ORF2 preferentially nicks one strand of DNA at a TTTT/AA site in the host genome, and reverse transcription is primed from the exposed 3′hydroxl. LINE-1 elements can also integrate at sites of dsDNA breaks in an endonuclease-independent manner (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">Morrish et al., 2002</xref>). LINE-1 RT shows <italic>cis</italic>-preference, meaning it is most likely to transcribe the RNA from which it was translated, but SINE elements like the one found in the taterapox genome can hijack LINE-1 machinery to integrate following replication.</p><p>Sometimes LINE-1 enzymes promiscuously reverse transcribe host mRNA, which might facilitate transfers of host genes to virus genomes. It is plausible that the poly(A) tail of either the host mRNA or a poly(A) tract in SINE transcripts initializes LINE-1 reverse transcription, in addition to faithful recognition of LINE-1 transcripts. Short target site duplications (TSDs) of sequences ~8–20 bp flank LINE-1 insertions of either LINE-1 or host sequences, likely a product of repairing staggered breaks during integration. The resulting LINE-1-mediated flanking duplications are copies of host sequences as opposed to specific retrovirus sequences. Additional evidence of LINE-1 action comes from comparisons with closely related species lacking the insertion and instead containing what is termed an ‘empty site’. Taken together, these features can help distinguish whether LINE-1 is involved in the transfer of host genes to virus genomes.</p><p>However, given that viruses rapidly mutate, unique signatures of retrovirus or LINE-1-mediated horizontal transfer may quickly degrade and obscure mechanisms of transfer. Therefore, we devised an experimental system to screen for the horizontal transfer of a gene from host to virus genomes using an artificial selection scheme. Combined with observations of viruses encoding recently acquired and highly conserved genes, we reveal LINE-1 elements as molecular accomplices in the transfer of host genes to virus genomes.</p></sec><sec id="s2" sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><p>We hypothesized that examination of genes recently acquired by HGT might provide clues for revealing mechanisms of gene transfer. Virus homologs of the host Golgi Anti-Apoptotic Protein (GAAP; also called transmembrane Bax inhibitor motif protein family 4 or TMBIM4), found in several orthopoxviruses, are ~75% identical to human GAAP (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Gubser et al., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib40">Saraiva et al., 2013</xref>), suggesting a recent acquisition and/or highly conserved function favoring virus replication. Strikingly, we observed nearly identical 21 base pair sequences flanking the open reading frame of virus GAAP (vGAAP), indicative of a TSD, consistent with gene capture resulting from LINE-1-mediated retrotransposition of host mRNA (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1A</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1</xref>). The vGAAP gene is situated near one of two identical inverted terminal repeat (ITR) regions of the virus genome, and on opposite ends of the genome in various viruses, suggesting that it was originally transferred into the ITR. A single copy of the putative 21 bp TSD at an analogous position near the other ITR in the cowpox genome suggests a pseudo-empty site (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1A</xref>). Taken together, with a published account of a non-autonomous SINE in the genome of taterapox virus (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">Piskurek and Okada, 2007</xref>), these observations suggest that host genes can be retrotransposed into poxvirus genomes by LINE-1 activity in a process akin to the generation of processed pseudogenes.</p><fig-group><fig id="fig1" position="float"><label>Figure 1.</label><caption><title>Retrotransposon-mediated transfer of GAAP into poxvirus genomes.</title><p>(<bold>A</bold>) The poxvirus gene vGAAP (orange) is encoded near the inverted terminal repeat (ITR; gray) of cowpox genomes.

In addition, at least two other classes of DNA viruses, herpesviruses and iridoviruses, independently acquired GAAP by horizontal transfer (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1B</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Bellehumeur et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">de Groof et al., 2015</xref>). Another study of Squirrel Monkey cytomegalovirus revealed that the S1 gene encodes a protein more than 95% identical to squirrel monkey Signaling lymphocytic activation molecule family 6 (SLAMF6), followed by portions of the 3′ untranslated region (UTR) of the host mRNA (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">Pérez-Carmona et al., 2015</xref>). Taken together, these findings suggest that many DNA viruses acquire host genes by retrotransposition. However, the majority of host to virus gene transfers lack signatures of retrotransposition, which can quickly degrade through mutation, motivating our development of an experimental strategy for capturing HGT events in real time.</p><p>We developed a selection scheme using vaccinia virus (Copenhagen strain), which encodes nearly 200 genes in a 191,737 bp genome (See Materials and methods). We focused on K3L, a gene that was presumably acquired from a host by an ancient poxvirus based on sequence identity with human eukaryotic initiation factor 2α (eIF2α; 27.6% identical) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Beattie et al., 1991</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Elde et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Elde and Malik, 2009</xref>). K3L diverged from eIF2α to encode a protein that blocks the host defense Protein Kinase R (PKR) pathway. PKR is activated by dsRNA produced by viruses in the cytoplasm during transcription of virus genes and virus replication. Upon activation, PKR phosphorylates eIF2α, leading to a block in protein translation and virus replication. K3L acts as a pseudo-substrate of PKR to competitively inhibit PKR from binding eIF2α (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s1">Figure 2—figure supplement 1</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Beattie et al., 1991</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Kawagishi-Kobayashi et al., 1997</xref>), and can be essential for productive infections depending on the host (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Langland and Jacobs, 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Park et al., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">Park et al., 2021</xref>).</p><p>Using a mutant virus deleted for K3L and another PKR inhibitor, E3L (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Brennan et al., 2014</xref>), we infected a rabbit kidney cell line (RK13) expressing chromosome-integrated copies of K3L fused to the gene encoding mCherry fluorescent protein (RK13-K3L) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2A</xref> and see Materials and methods for details). The host copy of mCherry-K3L complements the mutant virus lacking K3L, allowing it to replicate. Viruses grown in RK13-K3L cells were transferred to a non-complementing baby hamster kidney (BHK) cell line. Viruses lacking K3L replicate poorly in BHK cells, providing strong selection for viruses that ‘reclaimed’ the mCherry-K3L gene by horizontal transfer and/or somehow adapted in the absence of K3L to block host PKR and regain productive replication.</p><fig-group><fig id="fig2" position="float"><label>Figure 2.</label><caption><title>Experimental capture of K3L by horizontal gene transfer.</title><p>(<bold>A</bold>) Viruses lacking K3L (VCR2) replicated in RK13 cells expressing mCherry-K3L and were transferred to BHK cells lacking K3L to select for capture of mCherry-K3L.

The sequence of each transferred gene revealed hallmark features of mRNA gene capture, including 5′ and 3′ UTRs, precise intron splicing, and poly(A) tails (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3B</xref>). For 7 of 10 isolates, TSDs flanked mCherry-K3L insertions and contained cut site sequences matching the consensus (TTTT/AA) of LINE-1 endonuclease (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s1">Figure 3—figure supplement 1</xref>). Although there were no TSDs flanking mCherry-K3L in isolates 5, 9, and 10, these integrations might result from an endonuclease-independent LINE-1 mechanism at DNA breaks (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">Morrish et al., 2002</xref>). Because our experiments lack any exogenous reverse transcriptase, we tested for endogenous activity in the RK13 cells and detected robust LINE-1 activity (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s2">Figure 3—figure supplement 2</xref>). These results suggest that LINE-1-mediated retrotransposition may be a common mechanism of HGT in poxvirus genomes. While we do not exclude the possibility that genes can also be transposed into the viral genome by retroviruses, this would require co-infection. LINE-1-mediated retrotransposition may be more likely simply because LINE-1 enzymes are nearly ubiquitous in mammals.</p><p>In general, poxvirus genomes are arranged with the essential genes, shared by all poxviruses, in the central region of the genome. Clade- or species-specific genes, which more commonly exhibit evidence of HGT, are enriched near the ends of the genome (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Lefkowitz et al., 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">McLysaght et al., 2003</xref>). This pattern may reflect that gene transfer into the central genomic region genome is more likely to interrupt genes vital for virus replication (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Lefkowitz et al., 2006</xref>). Consistent with this, all but 1 of the 10 isolates, we recovered integrated K3L outside a roughly defined central region of the genome containing 90 core chordopoxvirus genes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Lefkowitz et al., 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2D</xref>). In the case of isolate 5, the K3L integration involved a duplication of two essential genes, G9R and L1R (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3B</xref>). In a contemporaneous study (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">Rahman et al., 2022</xref>), virus genomes that acquired a host gene by horizontal transfer within a duplicated gene also propagated. In both cases, gene functions were preserved by duplication. Spurious gene duplications can appear frequently in poxvirus genomes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Hughes and Friedman, 2005</xref>), pointing to a flexible means of poxvirus adaptation involving horizontal transfer even into essential genes.</p><p>Previous studies found that duplication of poxvirus genes, followed by rapid gene copy amplification, can boost virus replication (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Brennan et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Elde et al., 2012</xref>). In our analysis, we discovered two isolates where K3L had undergone polymorphic copy number increases (isolates 4 and 5; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4A</xref>). Homologous recombination, including unequal crossovers leading to duplications, requires as little as 16 bp of homology in poxviruses (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib45">Yao and Evans, 2001</xref>), suggesting that LINE-1 induced TSDs might facilitate gene amplification. Genes transferred within the ITR are duplicated on the other end by replication-based mechanisms (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">McFadden and Dales, 1979</xref>), as we observed in isolates 4 and 9 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2C</xref>). Genes integrated near the termini of the genome by HGT, like isolate 4, may be especially prone to duplication due to stretches of short, high copy tandem repeats found in and near the ITR regions (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4A</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5s1">Figure 5—figure supplement 1A</xref>). These observations are consistent with the idea that HGT occurs evenly across poxvirus genomes, but with an enrichment of transferred genes persisting near the ends, where insults to essential genes are less probable and duplication-based adaptation is favored (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5s1">Figure 5—figure supplement 1</xref>). Along these lines, gene families found only in specific lineages of poxviruses, indicating more recent acquisition, are more likely to be present in multiple copies than single-copy host-acquired genes found among diverse poxviruses (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Hughes and Friedman, 2005</xref>).</p><fig-group><fig id="fig4" position="float"><label>Figure 4.</label><caption><title>Homology-driven gene duplication of K3L and eIF2α.</title><p>(<bold>A</bold>) Schematics of mCherry-K3L duplications in isolates 4 and 5.

This recombinant virus better approximates the original ancient HGTs of the eIF2α gene that then evolved to become K3L in diverse clades of modern poxviruses (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Kawagishi-Kobayashi et al., 2000</xref>). Because the viruses we engineered to encode eIF2α in place of K3L also lack E3L, which encodes another inhibitor of the host PKR antiviral pathway, experiments with these viruses focus strong selective pressure on eIF2α to adapt to inhibit PKR.</p><p>We performed four serial infections of viruses expressing eIF2α or an eIF2α variant lacking the PKR phosphorylation site (S51A) in RK13 cells.

By sequencing the eIF2α region in evolved virus isolates, we found independent gene copy increases of eIF2α in both viruses (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4C</xref>).

Our discovery of LINE-1 retrotransposition-mediated HGT from host to poxvirus genomes has several notable implications. In addition to self-propagation in host genomes, retrotransposition to virus genomes could greatly extend the range of LINE-1 or related elements that subsequently mobilize to a newly infected virus host (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">Piskurek and Okada, 2007</xref>). The extensive host range of some poxviruses, for example, between rodent and primate species, suggests the possibility of cross-host lineage transfer of LINE-1s, non-autonomous SINEs, and host transcripts between mammals. A process involving the frequent appearance of DNA transposons in some insect viruses suggests an analogous mechanism for the spread of transposable elements between insect species (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Gilbert et al., 2016</xref>). In cases of retrotransposition of host transcripts, the resulting processed pseudogene products are enriched for highly expressed genes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib46">Zhang et al., 2004</xref>). The overrepresentation of certain transcripts might provide clues for understanding and predicting how viruses might adapt with repurposed genes mimicking host functions (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Elde and Malik, 2009</xref>). Currently recognized cases of HGT involving oncogenes, regulators of translation, like eIF2α, and antiviral genes that are highly expressed in response to infection. These examples of transcripts exhibit high gene expression and encode cellular functions easily repurposed to promote virus replication.</p><p>Repetitive TSDs generated by LINE-1 activity may also enhance poxvirus adaptation by facilitating rapid gene copy number amplification of horizontally transferred genes on arrival. Increases in gene copy number augment the probability of beneficial mutations appearing, allowing for swift diversification of newly acquired genes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Elde et al., 2012</xref>). Thus, form follows function as the repetitive termini of poxvirus genomes further enable the emergence and persistence of acquired genes predominately at the ends of the genome (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5</xref>). As beneficial virus gene variants endure, they end up closer to the center of the genome as subsequently captured genes appear near the ends.</p><fig-group><fig id="fig5" position="float"><label>Figure 5.</label><caption><title><bold>Model for horizontal transfer of host genes to poxvirus genomes</bold>.</title><p>The schematic highlights how host genes (purple) are retrotransposed by LINE-1 reverse transcriptase (RT, blue), into virus genomes (yellow box).

About 900 µl of virus was then used to infect a new dish of cells for P2, and the process was repeated for subsequent passages. Viral titers were determined using the remaining 100 µl of reserved virus stocks from each passage by 48 hr plaque assay in RK13-E3K3 cells.</p></sec><sec id="s4-11"><title>Analysis of viral-encoded eIF2α genes</title><p>RK13-E3K3 cells were infected with P4 eIF2α-GFP or eIF2α<sup>S51A</sup>-GFP viruses (MOI=0.1) for 24 hr. Virus-infected cells were collected, and total viral DNA extracted as previously described (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Esposito et al., 1981</xref>). The region between K2L and K4L containing the different viral-encoded eIF2α genes was amplified by PCR with primers K2L_seq_F and K4L_seq_R (<named-content content-type="sequence">5′-GGCATTGGTAAATCCTTGCAGA</named-content> and <named-content content-type="sequence">5′-CACCTTTTAGTAGGACTAGTATCGTACAA</named-content>, respectively). SNV detection was performed by sequencing across eIF2α using primers eIF2α_F and eIF2α_R for eIF2α-GFP and eIF2α<sup>S51A</sup>-GFP PCR products, CNV analysis was performed by PCR using primers eIF2α_rep_F (<named-content content-type="sequence">5′-CCTCCTATGGAAGCCAAAGCTGAAGATGAA</named-content>) and eIF2α_rep_R (<named-content content-type="sequence">5′-CCTCCTATCTACAACTTAGACC CGGCAT</named-content>) for eIF2α-GFP and eIF2α<sup>S51A</sup>-GFP viral DNA. Any CNV PCR products formed were sequenced using the same primers for break point detection.</p></sec></sec></body><back><sec sec-type="additional-information" id="s5"><title>Additional information</title><fn-group content-type="competing-interest"><title>Competing interests</title><fn fn-type="COI-statement" id="conf1"><p>No competing interests declared</p></fn><fn fn-type="COI-statement" id="conf2"><p>Reviewing editor, eLife</p></fn></fn-group><fn-group content-type="author-contribution"><title>Author contributions</title><fn fn-type="con" id="con1"><p>Data curation, Formal analysis, Validation, Investigation, Visualization, Methodology, Writing - original draft</p></fn><fn fn-type="con" id="con2"><p>Data curation, Formal analysis, Validation, Investigation, Visualization, Methodology, Writing - original draft</p></fn><fn fn-type="con" id="con3"><p>Data curation, Formal analysis, Investigation, Writing – review and editing</p></fn><fn fn-type="con" id="con4"><p>Data curation, Formal analysis, Validation, Visualization</p></fn><fn fn-type="con" id="con5"><p>Supervision, Funding acquisition, Validation</p></fn><fn fn-type="con" id="con6"><p>Resources, Funding acquisition, Validation</p></fn><fn fn-type="con" id="con7"><p>Conceptualization, Resources, Supervision, Funding acquisition, Methodology, Project administration, Writing – review and editing</p></fn></fn-group></sec><sec sec-type="supplementary-material" id="s6"><title>Additional files</title><supplementary-material id="supp1"><label>Supplementary file 1.</label><caption><title>Gene and protein sequence information.</title><p>Accession numbers for sequences used in phylogenetic analysis shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1B</xref>.

Horizontal gene transfer is a powerful mechanism of rapid evolution in many genomes, including humans and viruses. In this manuscript, a clever selection scheme is implemented to identify poxvirus genomes that have incorporated sequences from their host genome. Subsequent sequence analysis reveals that many of these sequences display the characteristics of terminal sequence repeats, splice junctions like mature mRNAs and other features characteristics of the movement of LINE elements in cellular DNA genomes. Then, subsequent duplication of these transferred sequences are consistent with the viral DNA replication strategy and rationalize some of the extant examples of horizontal gene transfer.</p><p>Essential revisions:</p><p>The only requests for modifications come in the presentation. Some of the experimental descriptions and interpretations are written so tersely and vaguely that it is difficult to understand them, let alone critique them. The explicatory parts of this paper are very short and seem to be written for a journal with a less general and curious audience and that enforces restrictive line requirements. This is not the goal of <italic>eLife</italic>. Specific examples of needed rewrites include:</p><p>1. In the Introduction, explication is needed for the curious non-expert of the biology and biochemistry of LINE elements and what was known about the mechanisms of their intra-genome movements. Statements such as that on line 67, stating that a target site duplication is consistent with LINE-mediated retrotransposition are not useful in the absence of such an introduction, given that there are many recombination mechanisms that can generate target site duplication. Perhaps that was implied in the phrasing &quot;consistent with&quot;. The argument becomes more convincing when, on line 76, sequences consistent with 'a process akin to the generation of processed pseudogenes' are described. It is not until Supplementary Figure 4, and the paragraph that beings on page 114, that the uninitiated reader learns about the LINE endonuclease and reverse transcriptase activities. The biochemical assays for them are not described. It would be much more helpful if this information were in the Intro.</p><p>2. The Supplemental Figures contain a wealth of information. Some of this should be in the main manuscript. For example, the genomic structures of the selected viruses – the most important data in the paper – are found in Supplementary Figure 3. At a minimum, these need to be in the main paper, and all the junction sequences in the Supplementary Material.</p><p>3. Similarly, the idea to select for the horizontal transfer of eIF2alpha to inhibit PKR is great, and it would be easy to explain to the non-virologist – it actually is, but only in the legend to Supplementary Figure 2. Interesting questions are asked about the ability of both wild-type version of eIF2alpha and a version that is not phosphorylatable being able to rescue a virus with its genes deleted of PKR inhibitors, but the implications for this on the mechanism of eIF2alpha inhibition of PKR are not discussed. Actually, the Supplementary Figures are barely referenced in the main manuscript, and S Figures 1 and 2 not at all.</p><p>4. On lines 137-139, there is the interesting line &quot;this activity might enable the persistence of horizontally transferred genes&quot;. There are many steps of logic in this suggestion that are interesting and potentially persuasive, and they need to be parsed. It is likely that they are presented in Supplementary Figure 5, which has a six-line legend for a very complicated series of hypotheses.</p></body></sub-article><sub-article article-type="reply" id="sa2"><front-stub><article-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.63332.sa2</article-id><title-group><article-title>Author response</article-title></title-group></front-stub><body><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Essential revisions:</p><p>The only requests for modifications come in the presentation.

This is not the goal of eLife. Specific examples of needed rewrites include:</p><p>1. In the Introduction, explication is needed for the curious non-expert of the biology and biochemistry of LINE elements and what was known about the mechanisms of their intra-genome movements. Statements such as that on line 67, stating that a target site duplication is consistent with LINE-mediated retrotransposition are not useful in the absence of such an introduction, given that there are many recombination mechanisms that can generate target site duplication. Perhaps that was implied in the phrasing &quot;consistent with&quot;. The argument becomes more convincing when, on line 76, sequences consistent with 'a process akin to the generation of processed pseudogenes' are described. It is not until Supplementary Figure 4, and the paragraph that beings on page 114, that the uninitiated reader learns about the LINE endonuclease and reverse transcriptase activities. The biochemical assays for them are not described. It would be much more helpful if this information were in the Intro.</p></disp-quote><p>We thank the reviewers for pointing out issues in the introduction and present a reworked and expanded introduction that introduces LINE-1 biology, defines genetic hallmarks of LINE-1 activity, and sets up the study with a broader audience in mind.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>2. The Supplemental Figures contain a wealth of information. Some of this should be in the main manuscript. For example, the genomic structures of the selected viruses – the most important data in the paper – are found in Supplementary Figure 3. At a minimum, these need to be in the main paper, and all the junction sequences in the Supplementary Material.</p></disp-quote><p>We promoted Supplemental Figure 3 to Figure 3B and swapped the details related to junction sequences to Supplemental Figure 3 to better emphasize the most important findings. We also split Figure 4 into two figures, with new Figure 5 displaying the model of horizontal gene transfer to better tie together the whole manuscript.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>3. Similarly, the idea to select for the horizontal transfer of eIF2alpha to inhibit PKR is great, and it would be easy to explain to the non-virologist – it actually is, but only in the legend to Supplementary Figure 2. Interesting questions are asked about the ability of both wild-type version of eIF2alpha and a version that is not phosphorylatable being able to rescue a virus with its genes deleted of PKR inhibitors, but the implications for this on the mechanism of eIF2alpha inhibition of PKR are not discussed. Actually, the Supplementary Figures are barely referenced in the main manuscript, and S Figures 1 and 2 not at all.</p></disp-quote><p>Thank you to the reviewers for pointing out this opportunity to better set up and explain the experiments with viruses expressing eIF2alpha and for alerting us to improve connections to the supplemental materials. We have revised the Results section to better explain how ancient horizontal transfers of the eIF2alpha gene evolved to become K3L in modern poxviruses. We now also refer to all the supplemental figures in the main text.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>4. On lines 137-139, there is the interesting line &quot;this activity might enable the persistence of horizontally transferred genes&quot;. There are many steps of logic in this suggestion that are interesting and potentially persuasive, and they need to be parsed. It is likely that they are presented in Supplementary Figure 5, which has a six-line legend for a very complicated series of hypotheses.</p></disp-quote><p>We have expanded our thinking in this part of the discussion and linked it to Figure 5 – supplemental figure 1, where the models are now expanded on as well as in the legend.</p></body></sub-article></article>
