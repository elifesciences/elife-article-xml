However, little is known about how specific nutrients affect neuronal development. Dendrites of class IV dendritic arborization neurons in <italic>Drosophila</italic> larvae become more complex when the larvae are reared on a low-yeast diet compared to a high-yeast diet. Our systematic search for key nutrients revealed that the neurons increase their dendritic terminal densities in response to a combined deficiency in vitamins, metal ions, and cholesterol. The deficiency of these nutrients upregulates Wingless in a closely located tissue, body wall muscle. Muscle-derived Wingless activates Akt in the neurons through the receptor tyrosine kinase Ror, which promotes the dendrite branching. In larval muscles, the expression of <italic>wingless</italic> is regulated not only in this key nutrient-dependent manner, but also by the JAK/STAT signaling pathway. Additionally, the low-yeast diet blunts neuronal light responsiveness and light avoidance behavior, which may help larvae optimize their survival strategies under low-nutritional conditions. Together, our studies illustrate how the availability of specific nutrients affects neuronal development through inter-organ signaling.</p></abstract><kwd-group kwd-group-type="author-keywords"><kwd>nutrition</kwd><kwd>somatosensory neuron</kwd><kwd>dendritic morphology</kwd><kwd>inter-organ signaling</kwd><kwd>wingless</kwd><kwd><italic>Drosophila</italic></kwd></kwd-group><kwd-group kwd-group-type="research-organism"><title>Research organism</title><kwd><italic>D. melanogaster</italic></kwd></kwd-group><funding-group><award-group id="fund1"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100009619</institution-id><institution>Japan Agency for Medical Research and Development</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>JP18gm1110001</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Uemura</surname><given-names>Tadashi</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund2"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100001691</institution-id><institution>Japan Society for the Promotion of Science</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>15H02400</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Uemura</surname><given-names>Tadashi</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund3"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100001691</institution-id><institution>Japan Society for the Promotion of Science</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>21H00251</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Hattori</surname><given-names>Yukako</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund4"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100001691</institution-id><institution>Japan Society for the Promotion of Science</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>21K06186</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Hattori</surname><given-names>Yukako</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund5"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100001691</institution-id><institution>Japan Society for the Promotion of Science</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>20J15084</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Kanaoka</surname><given-names>Yasutetsu</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund6"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100002241</institution-id><institution>Japan Science and Technology Agency</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>JPMJFR2051</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Hattori</surname><given-names>Yukako</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund7"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100007428</institution-id><institution>Naito Foundation</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Hattori</surname><given-names>Yukako</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund8"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100008695</institution-id><institution>Japan Foundation for Applied Enzymology</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Hattori</surname><given-names>Yukako</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><funding-statement>The funders had no role in study design, data collection and interpretation, or the decision to submit the work for publication.</funding-statement></funding-group><custom-meta-group><custom-meta specific-use="meta-only"><meta-name>Author impact statement</meta-name><meta-value>A muscle-derived Wnt signal promotes dendritic branching of somatosensory neurons in response to a concurrent deficiency in vitamins, minerals, and cholesterol.</meta-value></custom-meta></custom-meta-group></article-meta></front><body><sec id="s1" sec-type="intro"><title>Introduction</title><p>The physiological state of an organism influences organogenesis throughout the body. Among many external factors affecting the physiological state, nutrition in early life has a profound impact (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Bhutta et al., 2017</xref>). This is particularly the case with neural development, which is highly metabolically demanding. A large amount of energy is consumed to control neural stem cell division, form complex dendrites and long axons in myriad neuronal cell types, and ultimately construct functional neural circuits (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib66">Prado and Dewey, 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Georgieff et al., 2015</xref>). Compared to metabolic regulation of neural stem cell proliferation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Homem et al., 2015</xref>), little is known about how nutritional status is conveyed to developing neurons and how those neurons regulate growth in response to such a signal (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib72">Shimada-Niwa and Niwa, 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib73">Shimono et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib49">Liu et al., 2017</xref>).</p><p>Dietary nutrients are absorbed by the digestive tract and circulated throughout the body, and they are sensed by organs including the nervous system (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Chantranupong et al., 2015</xref>). Those organs communicate the nutritional status to each other by secreting signaling molecules, either low-molecular-weight metabolites or macromolecules such as soluble proteins and lipoprotein particles, to elicit tissue-specific responses; and it is this inter-organ communication network that coordinates organogenesis with body growth (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Droujinine and Perrimon, 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib80">Texada et al., 2020</xref>). In the nervous system, neurons sense circulating nutrients directly or by way of signaling molecules derived from other tissues, so there exist diverse modes of nutrient sensing (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib55">Morton et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">Jayakumar and Hasan, 2018</xref>).</p><p>The above-mentioned regulatory mechanisms of nutrient-dependent neuronal development can be explored at the molecular level with appropriate model neurons; and one particularly amenable model is the <italic>Drosophila</italic> class IV dendritic arborization (C4da) neuron located in the larval periphery (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Grueber et al., 2002</xref>). Dendritic arbors of C4da neurons extensively cover the body wall, and they are elaborated two-dimensionally between the epidermis and the body wall muscles. C4da neurons in larvae respond to noxious thermal, mechanical, and light stimuli and provoke robust avoidance behaviors (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib81">Tracey et al., 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">Hwang et al., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib88">Xiang et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib94">Zhong et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Guntur et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Chin and Tracey, 2017</xref>). In the context of adaptation of growing animals to nutritional environments, it has been shown more recently that the C4da neurons sense amino acid deprivation by an amino acid transporter, Slimfast, at a late larval stage, which contributes to overcoming the nutritional stress, thereby allowing pupariation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">Jayakumar et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib40">Jayakumar et al., 2018</xref>). In addition, we and another group have shown that dendrites of C4da neurons become more complex when larvae are reared on low-yeast diets compared to high-yeast diets (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1A and B</xref>, and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1âfigure supplement 1A</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib85">Watanabe et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib65">Poe et al., 2020</xref>). We designate this counterintuitive phenotype as hyperarborization. Although the entire larval development takes longer on the low-yeast diet compared to the high-yeast diet (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1âfigure supplement 1A</xref>), it is unlikely that the hyperarborization is a simple consequence of the longer larval stage (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib85">Watanabe et al., 2017</xref>; see also Results). Therefore, it has been assumed that the low-yeast diet is deficient in select nutrients, which causes the phenotype. However, the identities of such key nutrients responsible for the hyperarborization phenotype have heretofore not been determined.</p><fig-group><fig id="fig1" position="float"><label>Figure 1.</label><caption><title>A mixture of vitamins, metal ions, and cholesterol ameliorates C4da neuron hyperarborization.</title><p>(<bold>A and B</bold>) Representative output images of DeTerm.

Some of the cell-autonomous mechanisms include those related to intake and synthesis of metabolites: amino acid transporter SLC36/Pathetic (Path) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib47">Lin et al., 2015</xref>) and a critical regulator of fatty acid synthesis, sterol regulatory element binding protein (SREBP) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib54">Meltzer et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib95">Ziegler et al., 2017</xref>). Concerning the non-cell autonomous mechanisms, direct interactions between C4da neurons and one of the adjacent tissues, the epidermis, have been well characterized with the help of anatomical approaches under both light and electron microscopes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib92">Yang and Chien, 2019</xref>). Some portions of dendritic branches are attached to the extracellular matrix, and the attachment is mediated by signaling between an epidermally derived semaphorin ligand Sema-2b and its receptor Plexin B (PlexB) on the dendrite (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib53">Meltzer et al., 2016</xref>), as well as between a TGF-Î² ligand Maverick (Mav)-Ret receptor combination (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Hoyer et al., 2018</xref>). Other portions of dendritic arbors are wrapped by epidermal cells, so overall the dendrite arbor is embedded in the epidermis locally (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Han et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib45">Kim et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib78">Tenenbaum et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib42">Jiang et al., 2019</xref>). In contrast to the above dendrite-epidermis interaction, there is much less evidence for signaling between muscles and dendrites, despite their proximity to dendrites and their large volume in the body (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib93">Yasunaga et al., 2010</xref>). Furthermore, when considering the relationship between nutritional status and C4da neurons, little is known about how exactly the dietary information is remotely transmitted from the gut to the neurons. To address these unsolved questions, it is critical to efficiently quantify the effects of various nutritional and genetic conditions on this nutrition-dependent hyperarborization. For this purpose, we developed DeTerm, a software program for automatic detection of dendritic branch terminals (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1A and B</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib44">Kanaoka et al., 2019</xref>).</p><p>Here, we show that C4da neurons increase their dendritic terminal density on a low-yeast diet (LYD) compared to a high-yeast diet (HYD) due to a concurrent deficiency in vitamins, metal ions, and cholesterol. We then identified an extrinsic factor and an intracellular signaling axis that jointly enable C4da neurons to respond to the LYD nutritional status. On LYD, Akt and its upstream receptor tyrosine kinase Ror in the neuron are required for the hyperarborization. In a paracrine fashion, Wingless (Wg) produced by body wall muscles activates Akt by way of Ror and contributes to the hyperarborization. In muscles of larvae on the HYD, Stat92E, a transcription factor in the JAK/STAT pathway, was more highly expressed and negatively regulated <italic>wg</italic> expression, whereas the LYD resulted in lower expression of <italic>Stat92E</italic>, which partly contributed to higher expression of <italic>wg</italic>. Together, our studies illustrate how nutritional environments impact neuronal development through the Wg-Ror-Akt pathway between the neuron and closely located muscles. As for the neuronal function, we found that LYD blunted light responsiveness of class IV neurons and larval light avoidance behavior, which may help larvae optimize their survival strategies under low-nutritional conditions.</p></sec><sec id="s2" sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><sec id="s2-1"><title>A mixture of vitamins, metal ions, and cholesterol ameliorates the hyperarborization</title><p>Our analysis using the software program called DeTerm established that both the number of branch terminals per neuron and the density of terminals (terminal number/arbor size) were higher on LYD than on HYD (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1C-E</xref>). In addition to these box plots, we drew two-dimensional plots with the dendritic area on the X-axis and the number of branch terminals on the Y-axis, and the numerical features of dendrites of C4da neurons on HYD and those on LYD were clearly separated (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1F</xref>). Therefore, in the subsequent analyses, we mainly focused on the density of branch terminals (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1E</xref>) and the separation in 2D plots (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1F</xref>) to evaluate the hyperarborization phenotypes.</p><p>Yeast is one of the main ingredients in <italic>Drosophila</italic> laboratory foods, and it has been primarily considered as a source of amino acids. We suspected the possibility that LYD is deficient in amino acids and that is the cause of the phenotype. Therefore, we first examined whether supplementation of LYD with amino acids would ameliorate the hyperarborization. However, the addition of an essential amino acid solution, an amino acid mix, or peptone resulted in only slight or no restoration of the phenotype (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1âfigure supplement 1BâL</xref>, and see details in the legend). To more comprehensively search for nutrients responsible for the hyperarborization, we used fractions of a fully chemically defined or holidic medium for <italic>Drosophila</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib62">Piper et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib63">Piper et al., 2017</xref>) and examined which fraction or which combinations of the fractions were able to ameliorate the phenotype (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1âfigure supplement 1A</xref>). Addition of four fractions other than amino acids, which comprise vitamins (V), metal ions (M), cholesterol (C), and other ingredients (nucleic acids and lipid-related metabolites: O), to LYD significantly rescued the hyperarborization (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1G, H, J and K</xref>; see also the legend of <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1J</xref>). We named this diet LYD + VMCO. Further supplementation of amino acids to LYD + VMCO did not improve the degree of the rescue (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1K</xref>). Importantly, the phenotype was not restored without any one of three fractions, namely, vitamins, metal ions and cholesterol (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1LâR</xref>). On the other hand, the fraction designated other ingredients was dispensable for amelioration of the phenotype (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1S-U</xref>). These results suggest that the concurrent deficiency in vitamins, metal ions, and cholesterol contributes to the hyperarborization phenotype.</p><p>Larval developmental timing on LYD + VMC was comparable to that on LYD <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1âfigure supplement 1A</xref>; nonetheless the hyperarborization phenotype was blunted on LYD + VMC. We then examined whether extension of larval growth cause the hyperarborization by testing other dietary or genetic interventions. We previously compared dendrite morphologies between larvae reared on a low-sugar diet and those on a high-sugar diet that delays larval development (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib56">Musselman et al., 2011</xref>), and we reported that the hyperarborization does not occur on the high-sugar diet (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib85">Watanabe et al., 2017</xref>). We expanded this approach and analyzed the effect of the sugar overload on dendrite branching in a quantitative manner. When we observed dendrites in larvae reared on HYD supplemented with sucrose at the same timing as those on LYD (8â9 days AEL), they did not become more complex compared to those on HYD alone (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s2">Figure 1âfigure supplement 2AâE</xref>). Moreover, we observed the C4da neurons in larvae with <italic>dlip8</italic> overexpressed in wing imaginal discs, which is sufficient to extend the larval stage (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Colombani et al., 2012</xref>). This genetic intervention did not affect dendrite complexity (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s2">Figure 1âfigure supplement 2FâJ</xref>). Altogether, these results suggest that the prolonged larval period was not the primary cause of the hyperarborization phenotype.</p></sec><sec id="s2-2"><title>Akt and receptor tyrosine kinase Ror are required in C4da neurons to hyperarborize their dendrites</title><p>To investigate the molecular mechanism underlying the hyperarborization phenotype on LYD, we focused on intracellular signaling factors that have been reported to sense nutritional status in other cellular contexts.

As candidate receptors upstream of Akt, we focused on receptor tyrosine kinases (RTKs; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib74">Sopko and Perrimon, 2013</xref>), and conducted C4da neuron-specific KD screenings of 20 RTK genes (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="supp2">Supplementary file 2</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s4">Figure 2âfigure supplements 4</xref>â<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s6">6</xref>; see âRTK screeningâ in Materials and methods). One of the positive hits in our primary screening was <italic>RTK-like orphan receptor</italic> (<italic>Ror</italic>; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s4">Figure 2âfigure supplement 4C and D</xref>) and we confirmed that the <italic>Ror</italic> KD significantly suppressed the hyperarborization in the secondary screening (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2KâP</xref>). Moreover, we observed C4da neurons in <italic>Ror<sup>4</sup></italic> null mutant larvae and showed that they recapitulated the result of the KD (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2QâV</xref>). These results suggest that Ror and Akt are required in C4da neurons to hyperarborize their dendrites on LYD. Other positive hits included the known upstream regulators of Akt, Insulin-like receptor (InR) or Anaplastic lymphoma kinase (Alk). However, we could not definitively conclude whether InR and Alk contribute to the hyperarborization phenotype, due to inconsistent KD results among multiple experiments (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="supp2">Supplementary file 2</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s5">Figure 2âfigure supplement 5</xref>).</p><p>To further characterize the phenotypes of the <italic>Ror</italic> KD and the v2902 <italic>Akt</italic> KD line, we measured the total length of branches per neuron (dendrite length) and dendrite length/area on each diet (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s2">Figure 2âfigure supplement 2A, B, E, F</xref>). For both KD lines, values for length were higher on LYD compared to HYD in control C4da neurons. The v2902 line reduced dendrite length on both diets, although the decrease on HYD was marginal (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s2">Figure 2âfigure supplement 2A and B</xref>), whereas <italic>Ror</italic> KD only decreased dendrite length on LYD (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s2">Figure 2âfigure supplement 2E and F</xref>). This difference may reflect a restricted role for Ror in the response to a deficiency in the key nutrients, as opposed to a more general requirement of Akt for branch growth irrespective of the diets (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s2">Figure 2âfigure supplement 2G, H, J</xref>).</p></sec><sec id="s2-3"><title>Wg in muscles is more highly expressed on LYD and promotes dendritic branching of C4da neurons</title><p>Ror binds to Wnt ligands and triggers intracellular signaling cascades (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib68">Ripp et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib84">van Amerongen and Nusse, 2009</xref>).

Immunostaining using an anti-Wg antibody showed stronger signals in LYD-fed larvae (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3M, N and P</xref>). These stronger signals indeed represented increased amounts of endogenous Wg because knocking down <italic>wg</italic> decreased the intensity (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s1">Figure 3âfigure supplement 1MâQ</xref>). We also asked whether <italic>wg</italic> expression is up-regulated on LYD at the transcriptional level.

Nuclear RedStinger signals in muscles were stronger in larvae on LYD (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3Q-S</xref>), indicating that LYD up-regulated <italic>wg</italic> transcription compared to HYD. We further tested whether muscle-derived Wg promotes dendritic branching of C4da neurons. For this purpose, we overexpressed <italic>wg</italic> in muscles and found that those larvae increased the number of dendritic terminals per neuron on both HYD and LYD (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3TâY</xref>), strengthening the role of the muscleâC4da neuron communication in hyperarborization. Importantly, addition of vitamins, metal ions, and cholesterol to LYD significantly suppressed the up-regulation of Wg on LYD (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3M-P</xref>). Together with the effect of these compounds on dendritic branching (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1S-U</xref>), we hypothesized that <italic>wg</italic> expression in muscles is enhanced by a concurrent deficiency in vitamins, metal ions, and cholesterol in LYD, and that muscle-derived Wg promotes dendritic branching of C4da neurons.</p></sec><sec id="s2-4"><title>Wg-Ror-mediated activation of Akt in C4da neurons evokes the hyperarborization</title><p>Wnt signaling is engaged in diverse contexts of neuronal development and regeneration (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Green et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">He et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Endo and Minami, 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib57">Nye et al., 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib87">Weiner et al., 2020</xref>). In a previous study in <italic>Drosophila</italic>, responses to dendrite injuries were investigated using class I da (C1da) and C4da neurons. This showed that Ror, a seven-pass transmembrane receptor Frizzled (Fz), and downstream components including Disheveled (Dsh) and Axin (Axn) are required for dendrite regeneration (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib57">Nye et al., 2020</xref>). We therefore examined whether these genes and other components of Wnt signaling affect the hyperarborization phenotype (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s1">Figure 4âfigure supplement 1</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s2">Figure 4âfigure supplement 2</xref>). Knocking down <italic>fz2</italic> significantly ameliorated the hyperarborization (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s1">Figure 4âfigure supplement 1A, C, D, F, H, J</xref>). Not only <italic>fz2</italic> KD neurons, but also <italic>fz2</italic> null mutant neurons showed less prominent hyperarborization compared to the control neurons (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s1">Figure 4âfigure supplement 1KâP</xref>). These results are consistent with the proposed function of Ror as a Wnt co-receptor with Fz2 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib68">Ripp et al., 2018</xref>). In addition to <italic>fz2</italic>, KD of <italic>fz</italic>, KD of downstream components (<italic>dsh</italic> and <italic>Axn</italic>), or expression of a dominant-negative form of Bsk also significantly blunted the hyperarborization (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s1">Figure 4âfigure supplement 1B, E, G, I</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s2">Figure 4âfigure supplement 2</xref> [B, I, O and U], [G, N, T and Z], and [C, J, P and V]). However, we question whether all of these ameliorated phenotypes share the same underlying mechanism with those of <italic>Ror</italic> or <italic>fz2</italic> KD (see the legend of <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s1">Figure 4âfigure supplements 1</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s2">2</xref>, and DISCUSSION). Altogether, our results suggest that among the known components of Wnt signaling in <italic>Drosophila</italic>, at least Fz2 cooperates with Ror in transducing the external signal to evoke the hyperarborization.</p><p>Ror is also reported to activate the PI3K/Akt/mTor signaling pathway in lung adenocarcinoma or multiple myeloma (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib48">Liu et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Frenquelli et al., 2020</xref>). We therefore hypothesized that Wg-Ror signaling activates Akt signaling in C4da neurons on LYD, leading to the hyperarborization. To test this hypothesis and to clarify the relationship between Wg-Ror and Akt at the molecular level, we examined how genetic manipulations of Wg-Ror signaling affect Akt activity levels in C4da neurons (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4AâJ</xref>). The specificity of the p-Akt antibody in C4da neurons was validated in two ways: (1) p-Akt signals were significantly reduced by <italic>Akt</italic> KD <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s3">Figure 2âfigure supplement 3A-H</xref>; (2) expression of myr-Akt, a constitutively activated membrane-anchored form of Akt (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib75">Stocker et al., 2002</xref>), dramatically increased the p-Akt signal strength (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s3">Figure 2âfigure supplement 3I and J</xref>). Using this antibody, we first examined how the p-Akt level in C4da neurons differs between larvae reared on HYD and LYD. Immunostaining showed that the p-Akt level in C4da neurons was higher on LYD than on HYD (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4A, Aâ, C, Câ , and E</xref>). In contrast, <italic>Ror</italic> KD neurons from larvae on LYD showed reduced p-Akt levels compared to those on HYD (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4B, Bâ, D, Dâ , and E</xref>). Furthermore, <italic>wg</italic> overexpression in muscles increased the p-Akt level in C4da neurons on HYD (compare <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4Fâ</xref> with 4 Gâ), which became comparable to the level on LYD (compare <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4Gâ</xref> with <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4Iâ</xref>; see quantification in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4J</xref>). These results suggest that Akt signaling in C4da neurons is activated by muscle-derived Wg, and this activation is mediated by Ror in the neurons.</p><fig-group><fig id="fig4" position="float"><label>Figure 4.</label><caption><title>Wg-Ror-mediated activation of Akt in C4da neurons evokes the hyperarborization.</title><p>(<bold>AâE</bold>) Control ddaC (<bold>A, Aâ, C and Câ</bold>) or <italic>Ror</italic> KD ddaC neurons (<bold>B, Bâ, D and Dâ</bold>) were stained for p-Akt (<bold>Aâ-Dâ</bold>) and co-imaged with a C4da neuron marker <italic>ppk-CD4:tdTom</italic> (<bold>AâD</bold>).

To address whether the key nutrients (vitamins, metal ions, and cholesterol) increase Stat92E expression in muscles, we examined the reporter expression on LYD supplemented with or without VMC. However, the addition of VMC to LYD did not increase the signal intensity of the Stat92E reporter (data not shown).

First, we compared firing activities of C4da neurons in larvae that were reared on either HYD or LYD. As a noxious stimulus, we illuminated entire arbors of recorded neurons with blue light (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib88">Xiang et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib79">Terada et al., 2016</xref>). We used extracellular recording to monitor both spontaneous and evoked activities (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6AâC</xref>). The frequency of spontaneous firing was higher in C4da neurons from larvae reared on LYD than on HYD (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6D</xref>). Regarding the response to the light stimulus, all relevant parameters, i.e., the firing frequency, the change amount, and the change rate, were lower on LYD than on HYD (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6EâG</xref>, see definition of the parameters in the legend), indicating that C4da neurons on LYD are less sensitive to the stimulus. Next, we examined whether the blunted light responsiveness of the neurons affects larval avoidance behavior. It was reported that <italic>Drosophila</italic> larvae prefer dark places to avoid noxious light, and this light avoidance behavior requires the activity of C4da neurons (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib89">Yamanaka et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">Imambocus et al., 2022</xref>). We speculated that the blunted light responsiveness of larvae on LYD may cause declines in their light avoidance behavior, and this may allow larvae to continue their search for high-nutrient food. To address this possibility, we conducted light/dark choice assays in which larvae reared on HYD or LYD were allowed to choose between dark and bright areas. We found that both foraging 3<sup>rd</sup> instar and wandering 3<sup>rd</sup> instar larvae on LYD showed lower preference for dark places than larvae on HYD (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6H and I</xref>).

The addition of the above nutrient trio to LYD did not restore the branch terminal density to the same level as HYD. This may indicate that the balance of concentrations among these nutrients was not optimized or that unknown nutrients may need to be added along with these nutrients. In addition, we showed that up-regulation of Wg expression in muscle on LYD was suppressed by supplementation of these components to the diet. This regulation may be achieved at least at a transcriptional level possibly by an interplay between a hypothetical nutrient-responsive module in the cis-element of <italic>wg</italic> and transcription factors and/or epigenetic machineries that require vitamins, vitamin-derived metabolites, metal ions and cholesterol (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Harris et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib43">Kambe et al., 2016</xref>).

In that model, stress sensor FoxO is expressed less in neurons than in neighboring epidermal cells, which results in lower levels of autophagy and less suppression of Tor signaling in the neuron, thereby ensuring dendritic growth even under a low-yeast condition (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib65">Poe et al., 2020</xref>). In contrast to the above model, our model highlights the signaling between neurons and another adjacent tissue: muscles secrete Wg, while C4da neurons express the receptor complex Ror-Fz2 on their cell surface. Therefore, it is likely that both the extrinsic Wg-dependent mechanism and the FoxO-dependent intrinsic sparing mechanism work together to generate the hyperarborization phenotype.</p><p>Ror is mainly expressed in the nervous system.

Because Ror is required for the hyperarborization under the hypotrophic condition (LYD in this study; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2N and T</xref>) and for dendrite regeneration through the regulation of microtubule nucleation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib57">Nye et al., 2020</xref>), it could be an adaptive agent that copes with environmental stress or damage. The pathway for microtubule nucleation includes Dsh and Axn, whose KD appeared to ameliorate the hyperarborization of C4da neurons. It remains to be seen how Dsh and Axn contribute to the hyperarborization on LYD, and whether the Wg-Ror-Akt pathway and the Ror-mediated microtubule-nucleation mechanism intersect. A number of other RTKs, such as insulin/IGF receptors and EGFR, activate Akt in other cellular contexts such as growth and proliferation of various stem cells and mammalian cancer cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib71">Shim et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Butti et al., 2018</xref>).

In the adult stage, for example, muscle-derived Wg regulates lipid storage in the fat body (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib46">Lee et al., 2014</xref>). Our study revealed that muscle-derived Wg, which is up-regulated in response to low levels of vitamins, metal ions, and cholesterol, regulates dendrite branching of C4da neurons in the larval stage. Therefore, the muscle functions as a mediator of the nutritional status to other peripheral tissues in both growing and adult stages, and Wnt signaling may play a pivotal role in fulfilling this metabolic response function throughout the life cycle.</p><p>In our search for regulatory mechanisms of <italic>wg</italic> expression, we found that Stat92E reporter expression was higher in muscles on HYD than on LYD. This finding is reminiscent of Stat92E reporter expression in a population of GABAergic neurons in the adult brain, which project onto the Insulin producing cells (IPCs) and inhibit the release of Dilps (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib67">Rajan and Perrimon, 2012</xref>). This reporter expression in the GABAergic neurons also varies in a nutritional-status-dependent manner: the expression is higher on a standard laboratory food containing yeast compared to a sucrose-only condition. Our results suggest that Upd2-Stat92E signaling partially contributes to downregulation of Wg in muscles and suppression of the hyperarborization phenotype.

Moreover, the addition of a combination of vitamins, metal ions, and cholesterol to LYD did not increase the signal intensity of a Stat92E reporter (data not shown).

Consistently, larvae reared on LYD displayed decreases in their dark preference, compared to those reared on HYD, and they explored bright places, which is potentially risky for their survival (Control of <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6H and I</xref>). This difference between the diets tended to become smaller once the inter-organ signaling mechanism was suppressed in C4da neurons (<italic>ppk</italic> &gt;<italic>Ror</italic> RNAi in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6H and I</xref>). These results imply that the hyperarborization of C4da neurons on LYD might contribute to blunting light avoidance behavior, although we cannot exclude the possibility that the <italic>Ror</italic> KD might affect neuronal functions through other mechanisms than the dendritic morphological change. Our study raises the possibility that nutrient-dependent development of somatosensory neurons plays a role in optimizing a trade-off between searching for high-nutrient foods and escaping from noxious environmental threats. Although a recent study described the circuitry required for the larval light avoidance behavior, it remains unclear whether the possible modifications of neural circuits downstream of C4da neurons take part in this behavioral transition (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">Imambocus et al., 2022</xref>). The identification of the downstream circuits would allow further study of the relationship between nutrient-dependent neural differentiations and evoking risk-taking behavior.</p><p>In contrast to our results, a previous study reported that larvae with hyperarborized C4da neurons react more quickly to noxious heat (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib65">Poe et al., 2020</xref>). While light-induced Ca<sup>2+</sup> activity in C4da neurons decreases, thermal nociceptive behavior increases during 2<sup>nd</sup> and 3<sup>rd</sup> instar larval periods (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">Jaszczak et al., 2022</xref>), which indicates that these nociceptive responses are regulated in the opposite direction or in distinct fashions. Therefore, seemingly contradictory results between the previous study and ours may be due to different regulatory mechanisms of the sensory modalities.</p><p>The relationship between nutritional status and neural development has often been studied epidemiologically (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib66">Prado and Dewey, 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Bhutta et al., 2017</xref>). Our study, which presents a mechanism by which quantitative changes in specific nutrients act on neuronal morphology and operate through inter-organ signaling, provides a stepping stone for future explorations of molecular mechanisms linking nutrition and development of other neuronal cell types and in other animal species.</p></sec></sec><sec id="s4" sec-type="materials|methods"><title>Materials and methods</title><sec id="s4-1"><title><italic>Drosophila</italic> strains and fly culture</title><p>Fly strains used in this study are listed in Key Resources Table.

The Uemura lab previously reported that C4da neurons elaborate complex dendrites when larvae grow on low-yeast diets, a phenomenon called neural sparing. In the current study, they define the molecular mechanism underlying the nutrition-mediated phenomenon and identify that the inter-organ Wingless/Ror/Akt pathway between the neuron and its adjacent muscles is necessary and sufficient to mediate dendrite over-branching in the low-yeast condition.</p></body></sub-article><sub-article article-type="decision-letter" id="sa1"><front-stub><article-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.79461.sa1</article-id><title-group><article-title>Decision letter</article-title></title-group><contrib-group content-type="section"><contrib contrib-type="editor"><name><surname>VijayRaghavan</surname><given-names>K</given-names></name><role>Reviewing Editor</role><aff><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="ror">https://ror.org/03ht1xw27</institution-id><institution>National Centre for Biological Sciences, Tata Institute of Fundamental Research</institution></institution-wrap><country>India</country></aff></contrib></contrib-group><contrib-group><contrib contrib-type="reviewer"><name><surname>Yu</surname><given-names>Fengwei</given-names></name><role>Reviewer</role><aff><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="ror">https://ror.org/0574eex11</institution-id><institution>Temasek Life Sciences Laboratory</institution></institution-wrap><country>Singapore</country></aff></contrib><contrib contrib-type="reviewer"><name><surname>Chien</surname><given-names>Cheng-Ting</given-names></name><role>Reviewer</role><aff><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="ror">https://ror.org/05bxb3784</institution-id><institution>Institute of Molecular Biology, Academia Sinica</institution></institution-wrap><country>Taiwan</country></aff></contrib></contrib-group></front-stub><body><boxed-text id="sa2-box1"><p>Our editorial process produces two outputs: (i) <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://sciety.org/articles/activity/10.1101/2022.04.29.489983">public reviews</ext-link> designed to be posted alongside <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://www.biorxiv.org/content/10.1101/2022.04.29.489983v1">the preprint</ext-link> for the benefit of readers; (ii) feedback on the manuscript for the authors, including requests for revisions, shown below.

The following individuals involved in the review of your submission have agreed to reveal their identities: Fengwei Yu (Reviewer #1); Cheng-Ting Chien (Reviewer #2).</p><p>The reviewers have discussed their reviews with one another, and the Reviewing Editor has drafted this to help you prepare a revised submission.</p><p>Essential revisions:</p><p>One of the reviewers has consolidated and summarized our consultations on the individual reviews. These are given below. Please attend to each concern while responding. Please all see the individual reviews below.</p><p>1) Are Wg levels increased in muscles when Upd2, Dome, or stat93E KD is knocked down. Since wg transcription could be regulated in a complex way, the Dome/JAK/STAT pathway is likely insufficient to be the main or only regulator. This is also echoed by a result described in the Discussion that Stat92E was not elevated by VMC supplement in LYD. The authors should limit their description on the significance of these results such as the description in Abstract (and Figure 7) and conclusion on lines 276-279 in Results. Also, they could include more discussion on the possibility of other pathways.</p><p>2) Could authors compare the KD efficiency in two Akt RNAi lines (v2902 and BL33615) (or are they known in previous literature)? They also need to test the specificity of anti-Akt antibodies using these akt RNAi lines. Are anti-Akt signals gone when Akt is knocked down?</p><p>3) Was the dendrite hyper-arborization phenotype also observed in other types of da neurons? Did you see similar pAkt upregulation in other da neurons (class I-III) under the condition of LYD diets? If the authors have the results, it should be very nice to demonstrate the general and significant effects of their findings and mechanism.</p><p>4) The Akt mutant phenotype is quite different from the Ror mutant phenotype based on the images shown in Figure 2. It seems to affect more parameters of dendrite structure than Ror. The authors should elaborate on the phenotypic difference between Akt and Ror mutants, perhaps using different quantification approaches. It is therefore appears unlikely that Akt, which has a stronger and different phenotype from Ror, only mediates Ror signaling. Indeed, as the authors mentioned in the Discussion, Akt has previously been shown to regulate ddaC dendrite branching through signals from epithelial cells, and it has also been previously demonstrated, that, unlike Ror, Akt affects dendrite growth on standard diets (Parrish, 2009). The only data that suggests that Ror functions upstream of Akt are the pAkt staining shown in Figure 4. The authors need to confirm the specificity of the Akt antibody. In addition, the authors should address this concern by modifying the model in the Discussion (such as to include the possibility of excess growth by Ror knockdown neurons in LYD seems likely to be related to the function of Ror in mediating microtubule nucleation, the possibility of integrating InR and AlK in the pathway, which they have shown in this study in the supplemental data, as well as in a previous study (Poe, 2020)).</p><p>5) It looks like the major change for wg RNAi in muscle is a change in arbor area in LYD- indeed this often seems to drive or at least contribute to the phenotype (except in Akt loss). Is this because animals are overall larger? Since the arbors cover the body- is this increase in size related to overall size? If so, is the dendrite difference secondary to a much broader change in animal size? Are the same conclusions reached if a total number of terminals is shown?</p><p>6) The issue of lengthened developmental time on LYD is problematic and not sufficiently addressed. In a previous study on this topic (Poe), the continued growth of ddaC neurons was interpreted as resilience to malnutrition and shown to be controlled by lower levels of a stress transcription factor, foxo, than in other cells. In this interpretation, the ddaC neurons just continue to grow at their normal pace while the overall development of the animal is slowed. How is this view reconciled with the current model? Which conditions change developmental timing in this study? Do any of the genetic manipulations rescue developmental speed- and if so, is dendrite architecture changing secondarily to this?</p><p>7) In figure 6 â it would be helpful, if feasible speedily, to include Ror k/d in the electrophysiological assays. The behavioral assays look somewhat inconclusive in terms of whether Ror rescues the LYD phenotype.</p><p>8) On page 9 the authors mentioned screening 20 RTKs. It would be helpful to include this data. Certainly, two others they include â InR and Alk â look like they have similar phenotypes to Ror and it would be helpful to know the specificity.</p><p>9) There are two ways of statistics when manipulating gene activities (RNAi or OE) in HYD and LYD. Direct comparisons of two samples were used mostly in the main Figures (except Figure 5Z), while &quot;difference in two differences&quot; were shown mainly for several Supplemental figures (2, 3, 4, 5). It is not clear why the authors used two different ways. Are there specific reasons for doing so? Could not the direct comparisons of two samples (such as for main figures) could cope with descriptions in the text and easier to comprehend.</p><p><italic>Reviewer #1 (Recommendations for the authors):</italic></p><p>Nutrition profoundly affects neural development. The Uemura lab previously reported that C4da neurons elaborate complex dendrites when larvae grow on low-yeast diets, a phenomenon called neural sparing. In this current study, they elegantly show that vitamins, metal ions, and cholesterol, but not amino acids, are critical for these hyperaborization defects. They then define the molecular mechanism underlying the nutrition-mediated phenomenon. They identify that the Wingless/Ror/Akt pathway between the neuron and its adjacent muscles is necessary and sufficient to mediate dendrite over branching in the low-yeast condition. Moreover, they also identify a systematic Upd2-Stat92E pathway which is activated in muscles by the fat body. As a result, the low-yeast condition can unsensitized C4da neuron functions which may help larva to survive better under limited nutrition conditions. Overall, this is a comprehensive and important study that provides mechanistic insights into the question of how neurons over-branch in low-yeast diets. The experiments were well designed, and the results were properly interpreted. Most of the figures are well presented. Overall, this is an interesting and rigorously conducted study and the current version is ready to be published.</p><p><italic>Reviewer #2 (Recommendations for the authors):</italic></p><p>1. Akt knockdowns in two lines (v2902 and BL33615) display qualitative suppression of dendrite hyperarborization in Figure 2. In v2902 KD, while the dendritic arbor looks more normal in both HYD and LYD, the BL33615 KD showed quite a dramatic reduction even in HYD, and also in LYD, rendering both sets of data groups clustering on a distinct area (Figure 2I), instead of in between two controls (HYD and LYD) such as in Figure 2G. While these two lines have been used before, I am wondering if the BL33615 has a stronger KD effect and if the basal Akt is necessary for a fundamental process in normal dendrite development (which is still preserved in the v2902 line), irrespective of nutrient condition. Could authors compare the KD efficiency in these two lines (or are they known in previous literature)?</p><p>2. The wg signal derived from muscles is required for dendrite hyperarborization (Figure 3) is a very nice set of data, although the effect by overexpression of wg in muscle is limited in HYD (Figure 3Y). It could be due to further control such as from epidermal cells shown in Poe et al. (2020) <italic>eLife</italic>. The experiment was performed at 29C to increase Wg expression, and the dendrite morphology was not normal. I am not asking for more experiments, but the authors could describe/explain what is the results at 25C instead of using 29C for readers not familiar with the approach? Have the authors tried using 2 copies of UAS-wg to increase wg expression at 25C?</p><p>3. There are two ways of statistics used when manipulating gene activities (RNAi or OE) in HYD and LYD. Direct comparisons of two samples were used mostly in the main Figures (except Figure 5Z), while &quot;difference in two differences&quot; were shown mainly for several Supplemental figures (2, 3, 4, 5). It is not clear why the authors used two different ways. Are there specific reasons for doing so? I thought the direct comparisons of two samples (such as for main figures) could cope with descriptions in the text and be easier to comprehend.</p><p>4. The RNAi KD effects of Dome/JAK/STAT pathway components on inducing dendrite hyperarborization in HYD are quite variable! Three Dome RNAi KDs had no effect and one stat92E KD had an effect while the other had not! What are the effects on Wg expressions in muscles with these genetic manipulations? Since wg transcription could be regulated in a complex way, the Dome/JAK/STAT pathway is likely insufficient to be the main or only regulator. This is also echoed by a result described in the Discussion that Stat92E was not elevated by VMC supplement in LYD. The authors should limit their description on the significance of these results such as the description in Abstract (and Figure 7) and conclusion on lines 276-279 in Results. Also, they could include more discussion on the possibility of other pathways.</p><p>5. (line 217-218) &quot;However, these results need careful interpretation (see the Figure 4âfigure supplement 2 legend)&quot; From the legend &quot;However, knocking down dsh or blocking <italic>JNK</italic> signaling tended to increase the branch density over the control genotype on HYD, which may consequently reduce the differences in densities of dendritic terminals between the diets.&quot; I do not quite understand the reasoning here why some increases in HYD in the KD may reduce the differences in LYD? The explanation in the Figure legend is not clear!</p><p><italic>Reviewer #3 (Recommendations for the authors):</italic></p><p>The Akt phenotype is quite different from the Ror one based on the images shown in Figure 2. It looks like it causes a baseline phenotype in HYD, and overall seems to affect more parameters of dendrite structure than Ror. It is therefore unlikely that Akt, which has a stronger and different phenotype from Ror, is the downstream mediator of Ror signaling. Indeed, as the authors mention in the discussion, Akt has previously been shown to regulate ddaC dendrite branching through signals from epithelial cells, and it has also been previously demonstrated, that, unlike Ror, Akt affects dendrite growth on standard diets (Parrish, 2009).</p><p>In this study in the supplemental data, as well as in a previous study (Poe, 2020) (that interprets the overgrowth of ddaC neurons on LYD in a somewhat different way) InR has been shown to be important. It is not clear why it is dismissed in this study when it is much better established as a regulator of Akt than Ror.</p><p>The fact that Ror and Akt are interpreted as having similar effects on dendrite growth makes me very concerned about the quantitation method used. It is somewhat opaque and also at times dismissed (for example the growth phenotypes of InR and Alk are described as difficult to interpret and so sidelined, but it is unclear why).</p><p>The only data that suggests that Ror functions upstream of Akt are the phosphor-Akt staining shown in Figure 4. The antibody used is different from one previously used in da neurons in Parrish 2009 and looks like it is from a commercial source. With the recognition that much of the reproducibility crisis in science is due to poorly validated antibodies, it is essential to include key controls to validate this antibody- including loss of signal when Akt is knocked down. The differences in signal do not look particularly robust, for example when compared to those shown in Parrish 2009, and as the entire link between Ror and Akt rests on this data, it is imperative to be very sure that it is correct, and ideally do some additional experiments to determine whether Ror actually acts through Akt.</p><p>I would also suggest considering an alternate model, which seems much more likely based on data in the supplement and previous data on Ror function in ddaC neurons. To promote branching during dendrite regeneration Ror functions through canonical Wnt signaling proteins including dsh and Axin (Nye, 2020), which these authors also show have branching phenotypes in their assay. This Ror function is part of a Wnt signaling pathway that controls microtubule nucleation and also includes arrow, fz, and fz2 (Nye, 2020 and Weiner, 2020). The failure to exhibit excess growth by Ror knockdown neurons in LYD seems likely to be related to the function of Ror in mediating microtubule nucleation in these cells.</p><p>It looks like the major change for wg RNAi in muscle is a change in arbor area in LYD â indeed this often seems to drive or at least contribute to the phenotype (except in Akt loss). Is this because animals are overall larger? Since the arbors cover the body â is this increase in size related to overall size? If so, is the dendrite difference secondary to a much broader change in animal size? Are the same conclusions reached if the total number of terminals is shown?</p><p>I do not understand why some of the results are dismissed, but others are not. For example: why do the dsh k/d and bskDN results in more careful interpretation than, say the fz2 or fz knockdown? The reason given is that there is a slight increase in branching in HYD, but it also looks like that might be the case in Ror mutants, while the opposite is seen in Ror k/d.</p><p>There issue of lengthened developmental time on LYD is problematic and not sufficiently addressed. In a previous study on this topic (Poe), the continued growth of ddaC neurons was interpreted as resilience to malnutrition and shown to be controlled by lower levels of a stress transcription factor, foxo, than other cells. In this interpretation, the ddaC neurons just continue to grow at their normal pace while the overall development of the animal is slowed. How is this view reconciled with the current model? Which conditions change developmental timing in this study? Do any of the genetic manipulations rescue developmental speed- and if so, is dendrite architecture changing secondarily to this?</p><p>Correct controls are needed for RNAi experiments. Control RNAis should be paired with other transgenes rather than no RNAis to control for Gal4 dilution by expression of multiple transgenes. For example, in Figure 4 myr-Akt is compared to Ror k/d + myr-Akt. Ror k/d + myr-Akt should be compared to control RNAi + myr-Akt.</p><p>In Figure 4Supp1 it states in the legend that both fz and fz2 knockdown were different from control, but only fz2 is mentioned in the main text. In this figure, images are shown for an fz2 mutant, but no quantitation is shown.</p><p>Figure 5 â data seems a little preliminary. It might be better to figure out the pathway in which Ror acts rather than add another piece.</p><p>In figure 6 â it would be helpful to include Ror k/d in the electrophysiological assays. The behavioral assays look somewhat inconclusive in terms of whether Ror rescues the LYD phenotype.</p></body></sub-article><sub-article article-type="reply" id="sa2"><front-stub><article-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.79461.sa2</article-id><title-group><article-title>Author response</article-title></title-group></front-stub><body><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Essential revisions:</p><p>One of the reviewers has consolidated and summarized our consultations on the individual reviews.

This is because we conducted two experiments to address whether the Dome/JAK/STAT is a primary contributor to downregulating Wg on HYD, but the results were not supportive of such a possibility: First, when <italic>stat92E</italic> was knocked down in muscles, Wg increased on HYD; however, that increase was marginal (Figure 5F and 5G) compared to the change in the amount of Wg between larvae on HYD and on LYD (Figure 5F and 5H; see the quantitative data in 5J). Second, <italic>stat92E</italic> was not elevated by VMC supplementation on LYD (data not shown) as described in the Discussion in the original manuscript. Accordingly, we have followed the reviewersâ advice, carefully limiting our interpretation of the results, and we discuss the possible contribution of the hypothetical signaling pathways in the Abstract (lines 23-27), Introduction (lines 105-108), Results (lines 338-347) and Discussion (lines 441-448), as well as our model (Figure 7).</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>2) Could authors compare the KD efficiency in two Akt RNAi lines (v2902 and BL33615) (or are they known in previous literature)?

Before explaining our additional analysis on this matter, we addressed the specificity of the p-Akt antibody in class IV da neurons and the differential KD efficiency in two Akt RNAi lines in our response to Essential Revisions 2, and we have consolidated our model where Ror functions upstream of Akt (Figure 4).</p><p>To elaborate the phenotypic difference between <italic>Akt</italic> KD and <italic>Ror</italic> KD, we followed the reviewersâ advice and introduced a different quantification approach. In addition to dendrite âbranching,â we evaluated âelongationâ in our revised manuscript (Figure 2âfigure supplement 2). We measured the total length of branches per neuron (dendrite length) and also divided the total length by the arbor size (dendrite length/area). Box plots of dendrite length/area (Figure 2âfigure supplement 2B, 2D, and 2F) and that of terminal number/area (Figure 1E) showed obvious âhyperelongationâ as well as âhyperarborizationâ of the control class IV da neuron on LYD compared to HYD. In addition to the box plots, we drew two-dimensional plots with the dendritic area on the X-axis and the dendrite length on the Y-axis (Figure 2âfigure supplement 2A, 2C and 2E), which showed that the numerical features of dendrite length of the control neurons on HYD and those on LYD were clearly separated (red solid ellipse and blue solid ellipse, respectively).</p><p>Compared to the control neurons, strong <italic>Akt</italic> KD in the BL33615 line severely impaired both elongation (Figure 2âfigure supplement 2C and 2D) and branching (Figure 2C, 2F, 2I and 2J), irrespective of the diets. On the other hand, <italic>Akt</italic> KD in the v2902 line mildly affected the hyperelongation phenotype (Figure 2âfigure supplement 2A and 2B); and it did ameliorate hyperarborization on LYD (Figure 2B, 2E, 2G and 2H). These results indicate that the basal activity of Akt is required for both elongation and branching on HYD and LYD (Figure 2âfigure supplement 2G-2I), which is consistent with a previous report that demonstrated the requirement of Akt for the regulation of dendritic morphology of class IV da neurons on standard laboratory food (Parrish et al., <italic>Neuron,</italic> 2009).</p><p>Our critical findings are: (1) <italic>Ror</italic> KD or a <italic>Ror</italic> mutation blunted both elongation and branching only on LYD (Figure 2âfigure supplement 2E and 2F and Figure 2K-2V); and (2) the diet-dependent phenotype of the mild <italic>Akt</italic> KD by the v2902 line was partly similar to the <italic>Ror</italic> KD or mutant phenotype. Together with the evidence for the function of Ror upstream of Akt (Figure 4), our result reinforces the proposed role of the Ror/Akt signaling pathway in response to LYD. We have drawn diagrams of how the signaling pathway is working or defective and how it affects dendrite branching as well as elongation under individual genetic and dietary conditions (Figure 2âfigure supplement 2G-2J). Our model underscores the notion that Akt mediates signaling from multiple upstream receptors, including Ror.

We did not measure larval body size and cannot answer whether the <italic>wg</italic> knocked down larvae were bigger than control larvae on LYD. However, we believe that the suppression of hyperarborization by <italic>wg</italic> knockdown was not a secondary effect of the increased body size, for the following reasons:</p><p>1. As mentioned in the legend for Figure 1, 2D-plots of the control larvae, such as Figure 1F, show (1) a positive correlation between the area of the dendritic field and the number of branch terminals, and (2) a clear separation of 95% confidence ellipses of the numerical values between HYD and LYD (compare the blue ellipse with the red one). Therefore, instead of simply comparing the number of branch terminals between the diets, we focused on changes in the density of terminals (Figure 1E) and how far the pair of red and blue ellipses are separated in the 2D plot (Figure 1F) to evaluate the hyperarborization phenotypes. When <italic>wg</italic> was knocked down in muscles on LYD, its ellipse (the blue dotted one in Figure 3E) shifted closer to or overlapped with ellipses of the larvae on HYD (the red solid and dotted ones in Figure 3E). This result suggests that <italic>wg</italic> RNAi in muscles blunted the hyperarborization phenotype despite the increase in the dendritic area.</p><p>2. We also analyzed the effects of <italic>wg</italic> knockdown using another muscle GAL4 driver (Figure 3âfigure supplement 1A-1F) and <italic>wg</italic> hypomorphic mutations (Figure 3G-3L). The distribution of the arbor size on LYD was not much affected, neither by the knockdown nor the mutation (compare blue solid circles with open circles in Figure 3âfigure supplement 1E and Figure 3K); and again, the ellipse of the knockdown or the mutant larvae shifted closer to or overlapped with those of larvae on HYD (red ellipses in the 2D plots, respectively). Together with the box plots of the terminal number/area (Figure 3âfigure supplements 1F and Figure 3L), our results strongly suggest that reduced function of <italic>wg</italic> attenuates the hyperarborization phenotype without causally changing the body size.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>6) The issue of lengthened developmental time on LYD is problematic and not sufficiently addressed.

Do any of the genetic manipulations rescue developmental speed- and if so, is dendrite architecture changing secondarily to this?</p></disp-quote><p>The reviewers are concerned about the effect of the lengthened developmental time on LYD on dendrite architecture. The critical question is whether the hyperaborization phenotype is a secondary consequence of the longer larval stage on LYD than that on HYD. We gathered three lines of evidence against this possibility, which consist of the data already shown in the original submission and new data from two additional experiments. We explain each in the details below and also in the revised manuscript.</p><p>1. As stated in the original manuscript, we collected wandering 3rd instar larvae and imaged class IV da neurons as scheduled throughout our dietary or genetic interventions (6-7 days after egg laying (AEL) on HYD and 9-10 days AEL on LYD or LYD plus supplements; Figure 1âfigure supplement 1A). On LYD plus any combinations of nutrients, larval developmental timings were essentially the same as for LYD; nonetheless, the hyperarborization phenotype was blunted on LYD+VMC(O) (Figure 1G-1U). Moreover, throughout the testing of control genotypes and all genetic interventions, the timings on LYD were similarly longer than those on HYD; notwithstanding, <italic>Ror</italic> KD (Figure 2K-2P), a <italic>Ror</italic> mutation (Figure 2Q-2V), <italic>wg</italic> KD in muscles (Figure 3A-3F) or <italic>wg</italic> mutations (Figure 3G-3L) blunted the hyperarborization phenotype compared to that of the WT dendritic arbors. These results indicate that our dietary or genetic interventions ameliorated hyperarborization without changing the developmental timing on LYD.</p><p>2. As briefly stated in the Introduction in the original version of the manuscript, we previously compared dendrite morphologies between a low-sugar diet and a high-sugar diet (Musselman et al., <italic>Dis Model Mech,</italic> 2011), the latter of which delays larval development, and we reported that the hyperarborization is not observed between those diets (Watanabe et al., <italic>Genes to Cells</italic>, 2017). We have now expanded this approach and analyzed the effect of the sugar overload on the arborization in a quantitative manner (Figure 1âfigure supplement 2A-2E). The larval stage was longer on HYD supplemented with excess sucrose (HYD + sucrose) than on HYD; however, the dendritic arbors of class IV da neurons did not become more complex (Figure 1âfigure supplement 2C-2E). Thus, we showed that an increase in the amount of sucrose in HYD, which extended larval development, was not associated with hyperarborization.</p><p>3. Finally, we addressed whether any of the genetic manipulations that cause larval developmental delay are associated with an increase in dendrite complexity on a standard diet or not. Many genetic manipulations are reported to cause developmental delays; however, most of those also result in large increases in the body size (e.g., McBrayer et al., <italic>Developmental Cell,</italic> 2007), which may complicate the matters in solving our key question. We therefore chose <italic>dlip8</italic> expression in wing imaginal discs, which is sufficient to extend the larval stage with a minimum effect on body growth (Colombani et al., <italic>Science</italic> 2012). This genetic intervention caused a mild delay in larval development, but it was not associated with hyperarborization (Figure 1âfigure supplement 2F-2J), providing an additional piece of evidence allaying the concern about the effect of the lengthened developmental time on dendrite complexity.</p><p>The reviewers may wish to propose an experiment in which a genetic manipulation rescues larval developmental delay on LYD, and then examine whether the hyperarborization remains or not. This would be an interesting--but complexâexperiment, which would require comparisons between genotypes, diets, and timings. We believe that our data above sufficiently dismiss the simple possibility of the hyperaborization phenotype as a secondary consequence of the longer larval stage on LYD; thus, we propose our model wherein class IV da neurons are programmed to arborize in excess due to the indispensable role of Wg/Ror/Akt signaling in response to combined VMC deficiency. As discussed in the original manuscript and in the revised version, the Poe et al. paper highlights the relationship between the neuron and the adjacent epidermis, where the key molecular mechanism is the differential expression of the transcription factor FoxO. In contrast, our study unearths the communication between the neuron and another adjacent tissue, the body wall muscle, which upregulates Wg in response to low-nutrient conditions. Both mechanisms can coexist and contribute to the continued growth of ddaC neurons while the overall development of the animal is slowed.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>7) In figure 6 â it would be helpful, if feasible speedily, to include Ror k/d in the electrophysiological assays.

Reduction or loss of <italic>Ror</italic> function attenuated dendrite branching on LYD, while there were marginal effects on HYD (Figures 2K-2V in the revised manuscript). On the other hand, <italic>dsh</italic> knockdown or expression of a dominant-negative form of Bsk not only reduced dendrite branching on LYD but also increased dendritic branching on HYD (Figure 4-supplement 2B-2C, 2I-2J, 2O-2P and 2U-2V in the revised manuscript).

Indeed, as the authors mention in the discussion, Akt has previously been shown to regulate ddaC dendrite branching through signals from epithelial cells, and it has also been previously demonstrated, that, unlike Ror, Akt affects dendrite growth on standard diets (Parrish, 2009).</p></disp-quote><p>We thank the reviewerâs insightful suggestion.

Before explaining our additional analysis on this matter, we addressed the specificity of the p-Akt antibody in class IV da neurons and the differential KD efficiency in two Akt RNAi lines in our response to Essential Revisions 2, and we have consolidated our model where Ror functions upstream of Akt (Figure 4).</p><p>To elaborate the phenotypic difference between <italic>Akt</italic> KD and <italic>Ror</italic> KD, we followed the reviewersâ advice and introduced a different quantification approach. In addition to dendrite âbranching,â we evaluated âelongationâ in our revised manuscript (Figure 2âfigure supplement 2). We measured the total length of branches per neuron (dendrite length) and also divided the total length by the arbor size (dendrite length/area). Box plots of dendrite length/area (Figure 2âfigure supplement 2B, 2D, and 2F) and that of terminal number/area (Figure 1E) showed obvious âhyperelongationâ as well as âhyperarborizationâ of the control class IV da neuron on LYD compared to HYD. In addition to the box plots, we drew two-dimensional plots with the dendritic area on the X-axis and the dendrite length on the Y-axis (Figure 2âfigure supplement 2A, 2C and 2E), which showed that the numerical features of dendrite length of the control neurons on HYD and those on LYD were clearly separated (red solid ellipse and blue solid ellipse, respectively).</p><p>Compared to the control neurons, strong <italic>Akt</italic> KD in the BL33615 line severely impaired both elongation (Figure 2âfigure supplement 2C and 2D) and branching (Figure 2C, 2F, 2I and 2J), irrespective of the diets. On the other hand, <italic>Akt</italic> KD in the v2902 line mildly affected the hyperelongation phenotype (Figure 2âfigure supplement 2A and 2B); and it did ameliorate hyperarborization on LYD (Figure 2B, 2E, 2G and 2H). These results indicate that the basal activity of Akt is required for both elongation and branching on HYD and LYD (Figure 2âfigure supplement 2G-2I), which is consistent with a previous report that demonstrated the requirement of Akt for the regulation of dendritic morphology of class IV da neurons on standard laboratory food (Parrish et al., <italic>Neuron,</italic> 2009).</p><p>Our critical findings are: (1) <italic>Ror</italic> KD or a <italic>Ror</italic> mutation blunted both elongation and branching only on LYD (Figure 2âfigure supplement 2E and 2F and Figure 2K-2V); and (2) the diet-dependent phenotype of the mild <italic>Akt</italic> KD by the v2902 line was partly similar to the <italic>Ror</italic> KD or mutant phenotype. Together with the evidence for the function of Ror upstream of Akt (Figure 4), our result reinforces the proposed role of the Ror/Akt signaling pathway in response to LYD. We have drawn diagrams of how the signaling pathway is working or defective and how it affects dendrite branching as well as elongation under individual genetic and dietary conditions (Figure 2âfigure supplement 2G-2J).

The differences in signal do not look particularly robust, for example when compared to those shown in Parrish 2009, and as the entire link between Ror and Akt rests on this data, it is imperative to be very sure that it is correct, and ideally do some additional experiments to determine whether Ror actually acts through Akt.</p></disp-quote><p>The antibody used in Parrish et al.

This Ror function is part of a Wnt signaling pathway that controls microtubule nucleation and also includes arrow, fz, and fz2 (Nye, 2020 and Weiner, 2020). The failure to exhibit excess growth by Ror knockdown neurons in LYD seems likely to be related to the function of Ror in mediating microtubule nucleation in these cells.</p></disp-quote><p>The reviewer suggests that the Ror-mediated microtubule nucleation mechanism (Nye et al. 2020) may contribute to the hyperarborization phenotype.

However, we believe that the suppression of hyperarborization by <italic>wg</italic> knockdown was not a secondary effect of the increased body size, for the following reasons:</p><p>1. As mentioned in the legend for Figure 1, 2D-plots of the control larvae, such as Figure 1F, show (1) a positive correlation between the area of the dendritic field and the number of branch terminals, and (2) a clear separation of 95% confidence ellipses of the numerical values between HYD and LYD (compare the blue ellipse with the red one). Therefore, instead of simply comparing the number of branch terminals between the diets, we focused on changes in the density of terminals (Figure 1E) and how far the pair of red and blue ellipses are separated in the 2D plot (Figure 1F) to evaluate the hyperarborization phenotypes. When <italic>wg</italic> was knocked down in muscles on LYD, its ellipse (the blue dotted one in Figure 3E) shifted closer to or overlapped with ellipses of the larvae on HYD (the red solid and dotted ones in Figure 3E).

The distribution of the arbor size on LYD was not much affected, neither by the knockdown nor the mutation (compare blue solid circles with open circles in Figure 3âfigure supplement 1E and Figure 3K); and again, the ellipse of the knockdown or the mutant larvae shifted closer to or overlapped with those of larvae on HYD (red ellipses in the above 2D plots, respectively). Together with the box plots of the terminal number/area (Figure 3âfigure supplements 1F and Figure 3L), our results strongly suggest that reduced function of <italic>wg</italic> attenuates the hyperarborization phenotype without causally changing the body size.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>I do not understand why some of the results are dismissed, but others are not. For example: why do the dsh k/d and bskDN results in more careful interpretation than, say the fz2 or fz knockdown? The reason given is that there is a slight increase in branching in HYD, but it also looks like that might be the case in Ror mutants, while the opposite is seen in Ror k/d.</p></disp-quote><p>To address this concern, we added a brief description in the Results (lines 254-260), and we provide an explanation below in the figure legend (lines 1304-1311):</p><p>In our studies, we focused on the difference in dendrite terminal density between the two diets (HYD and LYD) and pursued dietary and genetic interventions that blunted this hyperarborization (see <xref ref-type="fig" rid="sa2fig1">Author response image 1</xref> in Essential revision 9). Reduction or loss of <italic>Ror</italic> function attenuated dendrite branching on LYD, while there were marginal effects on HYD (Figure 2K-2V in the revised manuscript). On the other hand, <italic>dsh</italic> knockdown or expression of a dominant-negative form of Bsk not only reduced dendrite branching on LYD but also increased dendritic branching on HYD (Figure 4-supplement 2B-2C, 2I-2J, 2O-2P and 2U-2V in the revised manuscript). This also appears to be the case with the <italic>Axin</italic> knockdown, although the effect was not statistically significant (Figure 4âfigure supplement 2G, 2N, 2T and 2Z). Given this phenotypic difference on HYD between <italic>Ror</italic> and <italic>dsh</italic>, <italic>bsk</italic>, or <italic>Axin</italic>, we speculate that Dsh, Bsk and Axin might regulate the dendrite branching through a mechanism different from the low-nutrient dependent Wg-Ror pathway. We therefore did not focus on these factors further in this study.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>There issue of lengthened developmental time on LYD is problematic and not sufficiently addressed. In a previous study on this topic (Poe), the continued growth of ddaC neurons was interpreted as resilience to malnutrition and shown to be controlled by lower levels of a stress transcription factor, foxo, than other cells. In this interpretation, the ddaC neurons just continue to grow at their normal pace while the overall development of the animal is slowed. How is this view reconciled with the current model? Which conditions change developmental timing in this study? Do any of the genetic manipulations rescue developmental speed- and if so, is dendrite architecture changing secondarily to this?</p></disp-quote><p>We understood that this reviewerâs concern is very important, performed two additional experiments, and described our response in Essential revision 6:</p><p>The reviewers are concerned about the effect of the lengthened developmental time on LYD on dendrite architecture. The critical question is whether the hyperaborization phenotype is a secondary consequence of the longer larval stage on LYD than that on HYD. We gathered three lines of evidence against this possibility, which consist of the data already shown in the original submission and new data from two additional experiments. We explain each in the details below and also in the revised manuscript.</p><p>1. As stated in the original manuscript, we collected wandering 3rd instar larvae and imaged class IV da neurons as scheduled throughout our dietary or genetic interventions (6-7 days after egg laying (AEL) on HYD and 9-10 days AEL on LYD or LYD plus supplements; Figure 1âfigure supplement 1A). On LYD plus any combinations of nutrients, larval developmental timings were essentially the same as for LYD; nonetheless, the hyperarborization phenotype was blunted on LYD+VMC(O) (Figure 1G-1U). Moreover, throughout the testing of control genotypes and all genetic interventions, the timings on LYD were similarly longer than those on HYD; notwithstanding, <italic>Ror</italic> KD (Figure 2K-2P), a <italic>Ror</italic> mutation (Figure 2Q-2V), <italic>wg</italic> KD in muscles (Figure 3A-3F) or <italic>wg</italic> mutations (Figure 3G-3L) blunted the hyperarborization phenotype compared to that of the WT dendritic arbors. These results indicate that our dietary or genetic interventions ameliorated hyperarborization without changing the developmental timing on LYD.</p><p>2. As briefly stated in the Introduction in the original version of the manuscript, we previously compared dendrite morphologies between a low-sugar diet and a high-sugar diet (Musselman et al., <italic>Dis Model Mech,</italic> 2011), the latter of which delays larval development, and we reported that the hyperarborization is not observed between those diets (Watanabe et al., <italic>Genes to Cells</italic>, 2017). We have now expanded this approach and analyzed the effect of the sugar overload on the arborization in a quantitative manner (Figure 1âfigure supplement 2A-2E). The larval stage was longer on HYD supplemented with excess sucrose (HYD + sucrose) than on HYD; however, the dendrites of class IV da neurons did not become more complex (Figure 1âfigure supplement 2C-2E). Thus, we showed that an increase in the amount of sucrose in HYD, which extended larval development, was not associated with hyperarborization.</p><p>3. Finally, we addressed whether any of the genetic manipulations that cause larval developmental delay are associated with an increase in dendrite complexity on a standard diet or not. Many genetic manipulations are reported to cause developmental delays; however, most of those also result in large increases in the body size (e.g., McBrayer et al., <italic>Developmental Cell,</italic> 2007), which may complicate the matters in solving our key question. We therefore chose <italic>dlip8</italic> expression in wing imaginal discs, which is sufficient to extend the larval stage with a minimum effect on body growth (Colombani et al., <italic>Science</italic> 2012). This genetic intervention caused a mild delay in larval development, but it was not associated with hyperarborization (Figure 1âfigure supplement 2F-2J), providing an additional piece of evidence allaying the concern about the effect of the lengthened developmental time on dendrite complexity.</p><p>The reviewers may wish to propose an experiment in which a genetic manipulation rescues larval developmental delay on LYD, and then examine whether the hyperarborization remains or not. This would be an interesting--but complexâexperiment, which would require comparisons between genotypes, diets, and timings. We believe that our data above sufficiently dismiss the simple possibility of the hyperaborization phenotype as a secondary consequence of the longer larval stage on LYD; thus, we propose our model wherein class IV da neurons are programmed to arborize in excess due to the indispensable role of Wg/Ror/Akt signaling in response to combined VMC deficiency. As discussed in the original manuscript and in the revised version, the Poe et al. paper highlights the relationship between the neuron and the adjacent epidermis, where the key molecular mechanism is the differential expression of the transcription factor FoxO. In contrast, our study unearths the communication between the neuron and another adjacent tissue, the body wall muscle, which upregulates Wg in response to low-nutrient conditions. Both mechanisms can coexist and contribute to the continued growth of ddaC neurons while the overall development of the animal is slowed.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Correct controls are needed for RNAi experiments. Control RNAis should be paired with other transgenes rather than no RNAis to control for Gal4 dilution by expression of multiple transgenes.

Fortunately, the results in the original version were recapitulated: Expression of myr-Akt in class IV da neurons increased the terminal density, regardless of whether <italic>Ror</italic> was knocked down or not.
