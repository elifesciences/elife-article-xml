Inside the erythrocytes, the parasites multiply via schizogony, an unconventional cell division mode. The inner membrane complex (IMC), an organelle located beneath the parasite plasma membrane, serving as the platform for protein anchorage, is essential for schizogony. So far, the complete repertoire of IMC proteins and their localization determinants remain unclear. Here we used biotin ligase (TurboID)-based proximity labeling to compile the proteome of the schizont IMC of the rodent malaria parasite <italic>Plasmodium yoelii</italic>. In total, 300 TurboID-interacting proteins were identified. 18 of 21 selected candidates were confirmed to localize in the IMC, indicating good reliability. In light of the existing palmitome of <italic>Plasmodium falciparum</italic>, 83 proteins of the <italic>P. yoelii</italic> IMC proteome are potentially palmitoylated. We further identified DHHC2 as the major resident palmitoyl-acyl-transferase of the IMC. Depletion of DHHC2 led to defective schizont segmentation and growth arrest both in vitro and in vivo. DHHC2 was found to palmitoylate two critical IMC proteins CDPK1 and GAP45 for their IMC localization. In summary, this study reports an inventory of new IMC proteins and demonstrates a central role of DHHC2 in governing the IMC localization of proteins during the schizont development.</p></abstract><kwd-group kwd-group-type="author-keywords"><kwd>malaria parasite</kwd><kwd>plasmodium yoelii</kwd><kwd>intraerythrocytic development</kwd><kwd>inner membrane complex</kwd><kwd>proteomic</kwd><kwd>palmitoylation</kwd></kwd-group><kwd-group kwd-group-type="research-organism"><title>Research organism</title><kwd>Other</kwd></kwd-group><funding-group><award-group id="fund1"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100001809</institution-id><institution>National Natural Science Foundation of China</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>32170427</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Yuan</surname><given-names>Jing</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund2"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100001809</institution-id><institution>National Natural Science Foundation of China</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>31970387</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Yuan</surname><given-names>Jing</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund3"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100001809</institution-id><institution>National Natural Science Foundation of China</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>31872214</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Yuan</surname><given-names>Jing</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><funding-statement>The funders had no role in study design, data collection and interpretation, or the decision to submit the work for publication.</funding-statement></funding-group><custom-meta-group><custom-meta specific-use="meta-only"><meta-name>Author impact statement</meta-name><meta-value>A systemic proteome of the pellicle organelle inner membrane complex (IMC) provides new insight for the intraerythrocytic proliferation of malaria parasite and identifies the palmitoyl-acyl-transferase DHHC2 as a key enzyme regulating the localization of IMC proteins through palmitoylation.</meta-value></custom-meta></custom-meta-group></article-meta></front><body><sec id="s1" sec-type="intro"><title>Introduction</title><p>Malaria, a human scourge caused by the protozoans of the genus <italic>Plasmodium</italic>, affects more than 200 million people and is responsible for approximately half a million deaths in 2019 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib82">World Health Organization, 2019</xref>). The symptoms of malaria are caused by the intraerythrocytic proliferation of the parasites. After erythrocyte invasion, the parasites replicate via schizogony to produce up to 32 invasive daughter cells called the merozoites. Following their release from the host cell, these merozoites invade other erythrocytes and continue the intraerythrocytic life cycle.</p><p>A defining feature of apicomplexan parasites, including the <italic>Plasmodium,</italic> is the organelle inner membrane complex (IMC) which are flattened membranous vesicles beneath the plasma membrane (PM). In <italic>Plasmodium</italic>, the IMC is present in the invasive or motile stages such as the merozoites, ookinetes, and sporozoites of all <italic>Plasmodium</italic>, as well as in the male gametocytes of human pathogen <italic>P. falciparum</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib50">Morrissette and Sibley, 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib40">Kono et al., 2012</xref>). In the asexual cycle of the <italic>Plasmodium</italic>, the biogenesis of the IMC begins at the early schizont stage after organelle duplication in the cytoplasm and several rounds of genome replication within the intact nucleus (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib47">Matthews et al., 2018</xref>). Allocation and packaging of nuclei and organelles into daughter cells are achieved by cytokinesis, in which the PM and the extending IMC coordinately invaginate and surround each daughter haploid merozoite (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Ferreira et al., 2020</xref>). As a result, the pellicle of merozoite is composed of a single membrane of PM, closely aligned double membranes of the IMC, and 2–3 subpellicular microtubules (SPMT) associated with the IMC (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib41">Kono et al., 2016</xref>). After invasion into a new erythrocyte, the IMC dissembles at the early ring stage (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Ferreira et al., 2020</xref>). The IMC is best recognized as the platform for attaching the actomyosin motor complex-glideosome (occupying the space between PM and IMC) responsible for parasite invasion and motility (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Harding and Frischknecht, 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Frénal and Soldati-Favre, 2013</xref>). It also serves to maintain the cell shape and rigidity of the merozoite (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Frénal et al., 2017</xref>). The cytoplasmic side of IMC is associated with a rigid meshwork composed of several families of proteins, including alveolins (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Gould et al., 2008</xref>), which is important for IMC-SPMT interconnection.</p><p>To understand the role(s) of the IMC in the parasite development, obtaining the complete list of protein components of the IMC is important. However, systematic proteomic analyses on the IMC protein composition have not been reported due to the difficulty in separating the IMC from other membranes, such as the PM. So far, a limited number of IMC and IMC-associated proteins have been identified, by either candidate gene strategy or isolating the interactors of IMC protein. Known IMC proteins include glideosome-associated protein 45 (GAP45) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib54">Perrin et al., 2018</xref>), GAP40 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Frénal et al., 2010</xref>), GAP50 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Bosch et al., 2012</xref>), myosin A tail domain interacting protein (MTIP) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Bergman et al., 2003</xref>), MyoA (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Bergman et al., 2003</xref>), ECL1 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Green et al., 2017</xref>), GAP with multiple-membrane spans 1 (GAPM1), GAPM2, GAPM3 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Bullen et al., 2009</xref>), ISP1, and ISP3 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib77">Wang et al., 2020</xref>) as well as the alveolin proteins IMCp, IMC1c, IMC1e, IMC1f, and IMC1g (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib40">Kono et al., 2012</xref>). In addition, calcium-dependent kinase 1 (CDPK1) and photosensitized INA-labeled protein 1 (PhIL1) were also reported to reside in the IMC of schizonts (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib42">Kumar et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib62">Saini et al., 2017</xref>). BCP1, MORN1, and CINCH, components of the basal complex, a subcompartment of the IMC at the posterior extending edge, were also recently identified (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib49">Morano and Dvorin, 2021</xref>). Remarkably, most of the known IMC proteins were refractory to gene deletion, suggesting an essential function in the development of asexual blood stage (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Ferreira et al., 2020</xref>). Among the IMC proteins, GAP45 and CDPK1 have been studied extensively. CDPK1 plays a key role in early schizont development as its depletion or inhibition causes parasite arrest at the early schizonts (; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib42">Kumar et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Azevedo et al., 2013</xref>). On the other hand, GAP45 is essential for merozoite invasion (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib54">Perrin et al., 2018</xref>). Despite great efforts in IMC research, many questions still remain regarding the IMC components and their function in schizogony. How many proteins are there in IMC? What determines IMC protein localization?</p><p>Enzyme-catalyzed proximity labeling (PL) coupled with mass spectrometry (MS) offers an alternative approach for proteome discovery (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">Kim and Roux, 2016</xref>). BioID is an engineered bacterial biotin ligase adapted for proximity-based biotinylation of proteins in living cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib61">Roux et al., 2012</xref>). The proteins covalently labeled with biotin can be isolated by streptavidin-biotin affinity purification followed by MS analysis. BioID has been used to identify the protein components of complexes and organelles in different model organisms (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib57">Qin et al., 2021</xref>). In <italic>Plasmodium</italic>, BioID-based PL has also generated organelle- and vesicle-specific proteins or proteomes, including those of the gametocyte-specific osmiophilic bodies of <italic>P. berghei</italic>, the blood stage parasitophorous vacuolar membrane of <italic>P. berghei</italic> and <italic>P. falciparum</italic>, the apicoplast of <italic>P. falciparum</italic>, and the IMC and apical annuli proteins of <italic>P. falciparum</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Geiger et al., 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Boucher et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib66">Schnider et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">Khosh-Naucke et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">Kehrer et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib80">Wichers et al., 2021</xref>). These analyses have led to the functional discovery of previously undescribed proteins, providing new insights in the organelle biology of malaria parasites. However, BioID requires parasite exposure to biotin over a long period (18–24 hr), which is not ideal or feasible for certain developmental stages with a short life span. In addition, BioID does not work well at temperatures below 37°C (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib48">May et al., 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Bosch et al., 2021</xref>), rendering its application to the mosquito stages of <italic>Plasmodium</italic> unsuitable. Recently, a new biotin ligase, TurboID, was developed by directed evolution (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Branon et al., 2018</xref>). Compared to BioID, TurboID is faster and can work under a broader range of temperatures (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Branon et al., 2018</xref>). So far, the application of TurboID in the <italic>Plasmodium</italic> has not been reported.</p><p>In this study, we applied TurboID-PL and quantitative MS to obtain a proteome of the IMC in the schizonts of rodent malaria parasite <italic>P. yoelii</italic>. IMC targeting was achieved by fusing TurboID with the N-terminal 20 residues of ISP1, a known IMC resident protein. A collection of 300 proteins were identified as candidate IMC and IMC-associated proteins, of which 83 are potentially palmitoylated. We further demonstrated DHHC2 as a master IMC palmitoyl-acyl-transferase which plays a critical role in schizont segmentation and merozoite invasion by regulating the IMC localization of CDPK1 and GAP45 via palmitoylation.</p></sec><sec id="s2" sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><sec id="s2-1"><title>Biotin-labeling of <italic>Plasmodium</italic> proteins by TurboID ligase</title><p>To test the activity of the TurboID ligase relative to the BioID ligase for PL of malaria parasites, we fused a hemagglutinin (HA) tag to the N-terminus of each ligase (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1A</xref>). These ligases were episomally expressed in the asexual blood stages of <italic>P. yoelii</italic> under the promoter of the <italic>isp3</italic> gene (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1A</xref>), a gene that is highly transcribed in the schizonts (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib51">Otto et al., 2014</xref>). Immunoblot detected comparable BioID and TurboID expressions in the asexual blood stages (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1B</xref>). Different from an automatous rupture of mature schizonts of the in vitro cultured <italic>P. falciparum</italic>, the <italic>P. yoelii</italic> schizonts displayed an arrest in rupture after maturation in the in vitro condition, which permits PL of mature schizonts. The schizonts expressing each ligase were incubated with 100 µM biotin at 37°C for different times (0.25, 1, 3, and 18 hr). Immunoblot using streptavidin-HRP detected robust protein biotinylation in the cell extracts of TurboID-parasites as early as 0.25 hr after biotin incubation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1C</xref>). In contrast, protein biotinylation in the BioID-parasites appeared at a low level at 3 hr and reached a high level at 18 hr (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1C</xref>). To confirm these results, dot blot experiments were performed using streptavidin-HRP and similar results were observed (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1D</xref>). Next, we tested the temperature compatibility of the two ligases for PL in the parasites. BioID- and TurboID-schizonts were incubated for 18 and 3 hr, respectively, with 100 µM biotin at different temperatures (4, 22, 30, and 37°C). Biotin-incubated parasites stained with fluorescently conjugated streptavidin revealed that both ligases had similar labeling activity at 30 and 37°C (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1E,F</xref>). Notably, only TurboID retained its activity at 22°C (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1E,F</xref>). We further performed dot blots using streptavidin-HRP and obtained similar results (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1G</xref>). These results indicate that TurboID is active at temperatures lower than 37°C, a temperature required for BioID to be fully functional. We also tested TurboID-mediated PL in the ookinetes, a mosquito stage of parasites with a preferential living temperature at 22°C. Cultured ookinetes from the BioID- and TurboID-parasites were incubated for 18 and 3 hr, respectively, with 100 µM biotin at 22°C. Costaining with the fluorescently conjugated streptavidin and anti-HA antibody detected cytosolic and nuclear protein biotinylation only in the TurboID-ookinetes when exogenous biotin was added (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1H</xref>). Compared with BioID, TurboID allowed more robust PL of proteins in the living parasites with a shorter biotin incubation time and is less temperature sensitive.</p></sec><sec id="s2-2"><title>Detection of IMC proteins using TurboID labeling and quantitative mass spectrometry</title><p>Next, we applied TurboID for PL of the IMC to identify new IMC proteins in the schizonts. The HA-tagged TurboID was fused with an IMC targeting peptide, the N-terminal 20 residues of ISP1 (Tb-IMC) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib77">Wang et al., 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib79">Wetzel et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s2">Figure 1—figure supplement 2A</xref>). The HA-tagged TurboID alone (Tb-cyto) served as a control to indicate non-specific biotinylation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1A</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s2">Figure 1—figure supplement 2A</xref>), permitting specific identification of IMC and IMC-associated proteins. Both ligases (Tb-IMC and Tb-cyto) were driven by the promoter of gene <italic>isp3</italic> and episomally expressed in the asexual blood stages (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s2">Figure 1—figure supplement 2B</xref>). As expected, the Tb-IMC ligase dominantly colocalized with the IMC protein GAP45 in the IMC (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s2">Figure 1—figure supplement 2C</xref>). The schizonts expressing Tb-IMC, Tb-cyto, or empty vector (EV: construct without ligase gene) were purified and treated with 100 µM biotin at 37°C for 3 hr. Both immunoblot and dot blot assays using streptavidin-HRP detected increased biotinylation in cell extracts in the presence of biotin from the Tb-IMC and Tb-cyto schizonts but not from the EV group (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1B</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s2">Figure 1—figure supplement 2D</xref>). Furthermore, parasites stained with fluorescent-conjugated streptavidin (SA-488) and anti-HA antibody exhibited an IMC distribution (surrounding daughter merozoites) of biotinylated proteins, which colocalized with ligase in Tb-IMC schizonts. The biotinylated proteins and the ligase displayed cytosolic and nuclear distribution in the Tb-cyto schizonts, while scarce signal was detected in the EV schizonts (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1C</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s2">Figure 1—figure supplement 2E</xref>).

First, the Tb-IMC proximal interactors were significantly enriched for interactions using Search Tool for Retrieval of Interacting Genes/Proteins (STRING) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib70">Szklarczyk et al., 2019</xref>), a database of known and predicted physical and functional protein-protein interactions. Notably, these proteins were segregated into two distinct subgroups (I and II) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1E and F</xref>). The subgroup I contained 152 proteins while the subgroup II contained 148 proteins. Most of known IMC or IMC-associated proteins were clustered into the subgroup I. In contrast, many annotated ER/Golgi secretory- or vesicle trafficking-related proteins were clustered into the subgroup II (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1E and F</xref>). Second, gene ontology (GO) analysis was performed to further discriminate the proteins in subgroup I and II (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s3">Figure 1—figure supplement 3</xref>). Interestingly, the subgroup II was highly enriched with the GO terms, including the vesicle-mediated transport (40 proteins), vesicle fusion (11 proteins), ER to Golgi vesicle-mediated transport (13 proteins), Golgi vesicle transport (20 proteins) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s3">Figure 1—figure supplement 3</xref>, biological process panel), and SNARE complex (14 proteins), endosome membrane (9 proteins), late endosome (7 proteins), and endocytic vesicle (16 proteins) (cellular component panel), while the subgroup I was mainly assigned with the GO terms, like the inner membrane pellicle complex (22 proteins) (cellular component panel), protein lipidation (10 proteins) (biological process panel), and palmitoyltransferase activity (6 proteins) (molecular function panel). The IMC arises de novo from ER/Golgi-derived material via vesicular trafficking and membrane fusion in the schizonts of each replication cycle of the parasite (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Gordon et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib83">Yeoman et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib55">Pieperhoff et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Bannister et al., 2000</xref>). Detection of the subgroup II enriched with vesicular trafficking and membrane fusion effectors agrees with the notion of the ER/Golgi-derived IMC biogenesis.

Out of these 83 proteins, we assessed 4 (CDPK1, GAP45, ISP3, and a newly identified IMC protein PIC5) for their palmitoylation using the resin-assisted capture of acylated proteins (Acyl-RAC) method (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Forrester et al., 2011</xref>). Palmitoylation was confirmed in these 4 proteins in <italic>P. yoelii</italic> schizonts (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3C</xref>), while PhIL1, an IMC protein not in the list of 83 proteins, did not display palmitoylation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3C</xref>). To further confirm palmitoylation, mature schizonts was treated with 100 μΜ 2-bromopalmitate (2-BP), an inhibitor of protein palmitoylation. We observed markedly reduced palmitoylation of CDPK1, GAP45, and ISP3 in the 2-BP treated schizonts (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3D</xref>). Notably, CDPK1, GAP45, and PIC5 lost their IMC localization and were found in the cytosol or nucleus after 2-BP treatment (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3E</xref>). Lower fluorescence signal of GAP45 and CDPK1 after 2-BP treatment may be due to loss of protein concentration at the IMC. As control, the IMC localization of PhIL1 and the PM localization of merozoite surface protein MSP1 were unaffected. Fractionation of schizont protein extracts (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3F</xref>) revealed that CDPK1, GAP45, and PIC5 were mainly present in the heavy fraction, in agreement with the IMC membrane association of these proteins. However, these proteins were mostly detected in the light fraction after 2-BP treatment, suggesting their distribution alterations after losing the palmitoylation. Together, these results suggest that palmitoylation may exist in a relatively high proportion of the IMC proteins and that it is important for subcellular localization of certain IMC proteins including CDPK1, GAP45, and PIC5.</p></sec><sec id="s2-6"><title>DHHC2 is an IMC-residing palmitoyl-S-acyl-transferase in schizonts</title><p>Next, we searched for the PATs that catalyze the palmitoylation of IMC residing proteins in the schizonts. 11 putative PATs (named DHHC1–11) were predicted in the genomes of rodent malaria parasites (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">Hodson et al., 2015</xref>).

The above cysteine to alanine mutation experiments indicated that the palmitoylation of the N-terminal cysteine (C5 in GAP45 and C3 in CDPK1) is required for the correct IMC targeting of proteins. We attempted to replace the C5 with alanine in the endogenous GAP45 of 17XNL parasite using the CRISPR-Cas9 method. A 742 bp DNA donor template containing the nucleotide substitution was used for homologous replacement. Seven sgRNAs were designed for guiding the Cas9 complex to the target DNA. After three independent transfections with each of these seven Cas9/sgRNA plasmids, we failed to obtain the GAP45 C5A mutant parasites.

Besides abundant proteins relatively easily detected by conventional immunoprecipitation, PL enables detection of proteins with weak or transient interactions. TurboID achieved satisfactory biotinylation in 1 hr, which is much shorter than the 18 hr needed by the BioID. To our knowledge, this is the first application of TurboID-based PL in the <italic>Plasmodium</italic>. We obtained a list of 300 Tb-IMC interacting proteins in the schizonts of <italic>P. yoelii</italic>. Among these proteins, 297 have orthologs in <italic>P. falciparum</italic> (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="supp1">Supplementary file 1</xref>), suggesting a conserved protein composition of IMC in the schizonts of rodent and human malaria parasites. Although the collection of 300 proteins may contain some false positives, two lines of evidence suggest good reliability of this IMC proteome. Firstly, about 50 IMC or IMC-associated proteins have been identified in <italic>Plasmodium</italic> to date (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Ferreira et al., 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib80">Wichers et al., 2021</xref>). Among these, 30 proteins (60%) have orthologs included in the Tb-IMC interacting proteins (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="supp1">Supplementary file 1</xref>). The absence of certain known IMC or IMC-associated proteins in the collection of Tb-IMC interacting proteins may attribute to the following reasons: restricted labeling radius of TurboID, lack of lysines for biotinylation, sterically inaccessibility of proteins by TurboID, or protein expression in other parasite stages (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib63">Sanchez et al., 2021</xref>). Secondly, subcellular localization analysis of 22 candidates confirmed the IMC localization of 8 known and 11 previously undescribed proteins. The localization results strongly suggest a predominantly IMC localization of the proteins tested, although the precise localization at the parasite PM or SPMT cannot be differentiated because of close proximity between IMC and these structures. The exact localization of these proteins at the parasite pellicle needs to be determined in the future using other methods, such as super resolution imaging, immunoelectron microscopy, or split green fluorescent protein. We noted that Wichers et al., recently explored an IMC proteome in asexual blood stages of <italic>P. falciparum</italic> with BioID using PhIL1 as the bait (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib80">Wichers et al., 2021</xref>). Of the 225 PhIL1-interacting protein candidates, the orthologs of 37 proteins are listed among the 300 Tb-IMC interacting proteins in our study (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="supp1">Supplementary file 1</xref>). We speculate that the differences in protein quantity and depth by PL are probably attributed to the species of biotin ligase, expression abundance of ligase, and the bait strategy.</p><p>PL experiments could produce a considerable number of false positives if proper controls are not included for ratiometric or statistical analysis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib57">Qin et al., 2021</xref>). In a rational design, the PL enzyme is fused to the protein bait of interest while the PL enzyme alone works as a reference control (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib57">Qin et al., 2021</xref>). To achieve the PL of IMC, the TurboID ligase is fused to an IMC targeting peptide (N-terminal 20 aa of ISP1) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib77">Wang et al., 2020</xref>), directing the IMC targeting of ligase (Tb-IMC) through the ER/Golgi secretary pathway. It is worth noting that the cytoplasm-facing feature of Tb-IMC ligase may prevent the detection of proteins in the IMC lumen. Background levels of ligase activity are set by a ligase not fused to the IMC targeting peptide. This ligase (Tb-cyto), as a spatial reference control, would not enter the ER/Golgi secretory pathway but instead stays in the cytosol or nucleus. Therefore, the Tb-IMC likely measures both interactions with the IMC proteins and interactions with the secretory pathway. Indeed, the 300 Tb-IMC interacting proteins were segregated into two distinct subgroups based on interaction network (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1E</xref>). Most of known IMC or IMC-associated proteins were clustered into the subgroup I. In contrast, the subgroup II included many ER/Golgi secretory pathway-related proteins. The major role of the subgroup I proteins is likely in IMC function, while the major role of the subgroup II proteins is likely in the secretory pathway. It is possible that some Tb-IMC interacting proteins may have roles in both the IMC and secretory pathway. Detection of the subgroup II proteins in this study provided another independent evidence supporting the IMC formation from the ER/Golgi-derived secretory system. In addition, concomitant capture of subgroup I and II as the Tb-IMC interacting proteins may reflect the tight and dynamic association between the IMC organelle and the endomembrane system in schizont development.</p><p>The list of increased IMC proteins allowed us to investigate the localization determinant(s) of IMC proteins which had remained unclear. Several mechanisms underlying IMC targeting have been proposed, including vesicle-mediated transporting of proteins containing a signal peptide, IMC membrane trapping of proteins with lipid modification, protein motif (alveolin repeats)-mediated IMC localization, and protein-protein interaction for IMC targeting (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib40">Kono et al., 2012</xref>). Palmitoylation is a post-translation modification in which a cysteine residue undergoes a reversible lipid modification, regulating localization and function of target proteins (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Bijlmakers and Marsh, 2003</xref>). Previous studies have implied that palmitoylation mediates the binding or trafficking of proteins to the IMC (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib77">Wang et al., 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib79">Wetzel et al., 2015</xref>). In <italic>T. gondii,</italic> many glideosome-associated proteins were also palmitoylated (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Foe et al., 2015</xref>). Interestingly, out of the 300 <italic>P</italic>. <italic>yoelii</italic> Tb-IMC interacting proteins, 83 (28%) have orthologs of the <italic>P. falciparum</italic> palmitoylated proteins in the schizonts (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">Jones et al., 2012</xref>). These 83 proteins include GAP45 and ISP3 with validated palmitoylation and CDPK1, GAP50, IMC1g, and IMC1c with predicted palmitoylation. These results imply that a high proportion of IMC proteins are palmitoylated. Palmitoylation of these proteins may be critical for their localization and function. Interaction of these palmitoylated IMC proteins with other non-palmitoylated proteins may also mediate the IMC localization of the latter.</p><p>11 putative PATs (DHHC1–11) are encoded in the genomes of rodent malaria parasites while there are 12 PATs (DHHC1-12) in <italic>P. falciparum</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">Hodson et al., 2015</xref>). So far, viable mutant clones were obtained for only DHHC3, DHHC5, DHHC9, and DHHC10 in previous knockout attempts (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib65">Santos et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib72">Tay et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">Hopp et al., 2016</xref>), suggesting other PATs (DHHC1, DHHC2, DHHC4, DHHC6, DHHC7, DHHC8, DHHC11, and DHHC12) may be essential for the asexual blood stage development. However, the association of these PATs with IMC has not been investigated in the schizonts. In this study, DHHC2 and DHHC1 are among the 300 Tb-IMC interacting proteins and both displayed clear IMC localization in the schizonts. Protein abundance assays and STRING analysis suggested that DHHC2 is likely the main mediator of palmitoylation of the IMC proteins in the schizonts. To determine if DHHC2 contributes to parasite development in vivo, we developed a method for investigating its function in the infected mice. Induced depletion of DHHC2 resulted in a complete growth arrest of the engineered strain <italic>mAID::dhhc2</italic> in mice in an IAA dosage-dependent manner, confirming the essentiality of DHHC2 in the asexual blood stage. In in vitro culture, we observed a significant decrease, but not complete ablation of mature schizont formation in DHHC2-depleted parasites. Most parasites were arrested at a stage earlier than the mature schizont due to defective segmentation or cytokinesis. The defect in asexual blood stage development in vivo and in vitro caused by the loss of DHHC2 was associated with impairment of IMC localization of certain IMC proteins. Indeed, among the 83 potentially palmitoylated IMC proteins, our analysis validated CDPK1 and GAP45 as substrates of DHHC2, but not DHHC1. Aside from CDPK1 and GAP45, other IMC protein substrates palmitoylated by DHHC2 remain to be validated. We previously reported that DHHC2 is critical for parasite development during the zygote-to-ookinete morphogenesis in the mosquito, and DHHC2 palmitoylates ISP1 and ISP3 for their attachment to the IMC to facilitate connection between the IMC and the SPMT (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib77">Wang et al., 2020</xref>). Therefore, DHHC2 plays critical roles in IMC targeting of many proteins at multiple developmental stages.</p><p>Compared to the reduction in the <italic>mAID::dhhc2</italic> schizonts caused by IAA treatment, the treatment with 2-BP, a broad-spectrum inhibitor of protein palmitoylation, resulted in no formation of mature <italic>mAID::dhhc2</italic> schizonts (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6D and E</xref>). The effects of IAA are specific to the mAID-fused DHHC2 in the <italic>mAID::dhhc2</italic> schizonts, whereas 2-BP could inhibit protein palmitoylation mediated by DHHC2 and other PATs, including DHHC1. We suspect that the IMC-residing DHHC1 is also essential for schizont development, but its precise roles and substrate proteins also awaits investigation in the future.</p><p>Besides the PATs DHHC2 and DHHC1, several kinases including CDPK1, CDPK4, and PKA, were also found among the Tb-IMC interacting proteins. CDPK1, CDPK4, and PKA were further validated to localize at the IMC of <italic>P. yoelii</italic>, in accordance with their orthologs’ localization in <italic>P. falciparum</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib42">Kumar et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Fang et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib81">Wilde et al., 2019</xref>). CDPK1 has been reported to be essential for schizont development. Both conditional knockdown and inhibition of CDPK1 can arrest <italic>P. falciparum</italic> schizont development (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib42">Kumar et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Azevedo et al., 2013</xref>), mimicking the phenotypes of the DHHC2-depleted parasites in this study. Interestingly, phosphoproteomic analysis revealed that the conditional knockdown of CDPK1 led to the hypophosphorylation of several IMC and glideosome proteins, including GAP45, MTIP, and PKA regulatory subunit (PKAr) (; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib42">Kumar et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib81">Wilde et al., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Green et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib59">Ridzuan et al., 2012</xref>). In this study, we found that DHHC2-mediated palmitoylation is required for CDPK1 localization at IMC. Thus, palmitoylation and IMC localization are the prerequisites for CDPK1-mediated phosphorylation of IMC proteins. Based on all available data, we speculated that once the IMC biogenesis is initiated in early schizonts, DHHC2 is recruited to the nascent IMC, possibly by an auto-palmitoylation mechanism (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib77">Wang et al., 2020</xref>). However, DHHC2 seems inessential for IMC biogenesis because the IMC seemed morphologically normal despite DHHC2 depletion (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5I</xref>). In contrast, DHHC2 palmitoylates certain important proteins for their IMC localization in the developing schizonts and mature merozoites. It has critical function in schizont cytokinesis and erythrocyte invasion.</p></sec><sec id="s4" sec-type="materials|methods"><title>Materials and methods</title><sec id="s4-1"><title>Plasmid construction and parasite transfection</title><p>CRISPR-Cas9 plasmid pYCm was used for parasite genomic modification (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib43">Leung et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib84">Zhang et al., 2014</xref>). To construct the plasmids for gene deletion, the N- or C-terminal segments (400–600 bp) of the coding regions were PCR-amplified as the left or right homologous arm or 400–600 bp from 5-UTR or 3-UTR following the translation stop codon as left or right arm, respectively. To construct the plasmids for gene tagging, the DNA fragment (encoding 6 HA, 4Myc, GFP, or mAID-2HA) was inserted between the left and right arms in frame with the gene of interest. For each gene tagging, two sgRNAs were designed to target sites close to the N- or C-terminal part of the coding region. To construct the plasmid for amino acid substitution, the donor template (700–800 bp) for homologous recombination was introduced with the targeted mutations for amino acid substitution and extra shield mutations via mutagenesis.

characteristic inner membrane complex (IMC), which plays an essential role in maintaining the parasite shape and regulating motility. In this study, the authors used proximity labeling to determine the IMC proteome of erythrocytic stages in the rodent malaria parasite Plasmodium yoelii. They identify the palmitoyl-acyl-transferase DHHC2 as a key enzyme that regulates the localization of IMC proteins through palmitoylation.

Your article has been reviewed by 3 peer reviewers, one of whom is a member of our Board of Reviewing Editors, and the evaluation has been overseen Vivek Malhotra as the Senior Editor. The reviewers have opted to remain anonymous.</p><p>The reviewers have discussed their reviews with one another, and the Reviewing Editor has drafted this to help you prepare a revised submission.</p><p>All three reviewers agree that this is an interesting and important study and that the work is robust. However, they also raised a number of points, as detailed in their recommendations to the authors, which need to be addressed to clarify some aspects of the work and revise some of the conclusions.</p><p>Specifically, the following points must be addressed:</p><p>1) Clarify the strategy to select candidates from the TurboID screen.</p><p>2) Clarify the localization of CDPK1 (including by improving imaging).</p><p>3) Revise the conclusions on the role of DHHC2-mediated palmitoylation of GAP45 and CDPK1 (including by providing additional control of IMC integrity).</p><p>4) Address discrepancies in the analysis of DHHC2-deficient or 2-BP treated schizonts (especially regarding MSP1 labelling).</p><p>The reviewers also noted that the title is not appropriate and should be modified.</p><p><italic>Reviewer #1 (Recommendations for the authors):</italic></p><p>The study identifies a large number of putative IMC proteins, with only partial overlap with other studies performed in <italic>P. falciparum</italic>. This suggests a potentially high rate of false positives, although 11 out of 14 new proteins were confirmed to be localized in the IMC. The authors should explain how they selected the 14 candidate proteins. This is important to ensure the absence of bias. Do these proteins correspond to the 22 proteins with assigned GO term IMC (line 219)? It is likely that many of the identified proteins correspond to trafficking-related proteins, as discussed in the text, or plasma membrane proteins (such as PMP1) or cytosolic proteins (since the ligase is exposed on the cytosolic face of the IMC). Did the authors consider using purified merozoites instead of schizonts to apply the TurboID proximity labelling? This might allow a more stringent identification of IMC resident proteins.</p><p>In addition, the study missed some known IMC proteins, which should be mentioned in the text and discussed further (line 544). For example, how do the authors explain that ISP1 (which was used to target TurboID to the IMC) was not identified in the screen?</p><p>In their initial mass spectrometry results the authors identified 488 proteins but discarded 188 based on gene expression profiling. What are these 188 proteins?</p><p>The authors should revise the table in Figure 2B.</p><p>– PMP1 has been described as a plasma membrane protein in P. berghei (PMID 28851956).</p><p>– pPK1 has been shown to be apically localized in P. yoelii merozoites, not in the IMC (PMID 31953169). How do the authors explain this discrepancy?</p><p>– PY17X_1139700 is annotated as TMCO1 in PlasmoDB.</p><p>– PY17X_1411000 is annotated as PhIL1-interacting candidate 5 (PIC5) and has been shown to be an IMC protein and should be counted with the known IMC proteins (PMID 33830607 and 34324609).</p><p>The data in Figure 3 show that 2BP has a marked effect on palmitoylation and IMC localization of 3 proteins (CDPK1, GAP45 and 1411000). However, it is important to control that 2BP does not completely disrupt IMC integrity, for example using PhIL1 as a marker.</p><p>In Figure 6C, why is the GAP45 and CDPK1 signal so low after IAA treatment, although input in western blot looks similar to the vehicle control (Figure 6A)?</p><p>Same comment in figure 7B and 7E, where it is not clear whether it is the localization of GAP45/CDPK1 that is affected rather than their level of expression.</p><p>What is the effect of DHHC1 depletion on parasite growth and schizont segmentation (line 460-468)?</p><p><italic>Reviewer #2 (Recommendations for the authors):</italic></p><p>1. The proximity labelling experiments using the TurboID are properly controlled and analyzed.

Would it be possible that this protein is localized at the plasma membrane (PM) rather than the IMC? In Green et al., 2008 and Ridzuan et al., 2012, the authors can distinguish between the IMC and PM localization of their proteins of interest in <italic>Plasmodium falciparum</italic>, PfCDPK1, PfGAP45 and PfMTIP, by observing the signal around the residual body.

The palmitoylation of GAP45, CDPK1 and PY17X_1411000 in Figure 3 is convincing.

The authors should explain why, in this experiment, the &quot;distribution of MSP1 in the DHHC2-deficient schizonts was also unaffected&quot; (line 455, p15).</p><p>4.

This point is important for CDPK1 to be a direct substrate of DHHC2.

Therefore the C5 site described here is likely at the PM and not at the IMC. However, the investigation of the other sites is very interesting and undoubtedly dependent of DHHC2 but the episomal construct used here is likely not relevant since the C-terminal tag likely already impacts the IMC localization has shown in <italic>T. gondii</italic>. That might explain why the C5A mutant becomes cytosolic, being not anchored in any membrane of the pellicle.

While the paper contains a substantial amount of data, it feels like two independent stories that are not as well connected as they could be. The proximity labelling identifies a number of new IMC proteins, many of which are likely palmitoylated. But then rather than probing these deeper, the authors switch to focus on DHHC2 and its role in the trafficking and function of two well-known IMC protein targets. However, this is still a strong paper and an important contribution to the field.</p><p>2. Line 22. The authors claim that &quot;19 of the 22 selected targets were confirmed to localize to the IMC&quot;. This is somewhat disingenuous as 8 of these were already known IMC proteins. Of the remaining 14 that were chosen for verification (lines 248-252) – were they randomly selected or were certain criteria applied in the selection process? (e.g. predicted palmitoylation, IMC in <italic>T. gondii</italic> [Rab11B], etc). This should be clarified.</p><p>3. Regarding cytosolic localization for the control TurboID.</p><p>a) Line 141 – ookinetes – &quot;detected cytosolic protein biotinylation&quot;. The staining appears both cytoplasmic and nuclear. This would make sense because the mass of the fusion protein is less than the nuclear pore cutoff (~50kDa) and thus it is likely to freely diffuse into the nucleus.</p><p>b) Line 163 – this comment also applies to the Tb-cyto – is it cytoplasmic and nuclear or somehow nuclear excluded in the parasites? (Figure 1C and S2E).</p><p>4. Figure S4. Regarding N vs C terminal tagging – I am presuming that the N-terminally tagged Rab11A, Rab11B (1359500) were tagged in this fashion to not disrupt C-terminal cysteines. This would be worth mentioning. Also, why is 1359500 not designated Rab11B? (which has previously been shown to be IMC localized in <italic>T. gondii</italic>)</p><p>5. Line 330, Figure 4I – Clarify that this is referring to the multiple spots that colocalize. In addition, there appears to be a separate GAP45 spot? This should be discussed and some arrows would be helpful here.</p><p>6. Line 505-510 – The authors note that the key palmitoyated sites are conserved among the Plasmodia. Are these sites conserved in <italic>T. gondii</italic>?</p><p>7. Figure 6C, line 451 – It is unclear how the loss of IMC localization occurs upon DHHC2 knockdown as there is no control for the IMC in these images.</p><p>8.

Many elements provided in the rebuttal could be included in the manuscript to strengthen the conclusions and clarify some points.</p><p>Specifically:</p><p>1) line 308: &quot;Notably, CDPK1, GAP45, and PIC5 lost their IMC localization and were found in the cytosol or nucleus after 2-BP treatment (Figure 3E)&quot;. The signal is too weak to ascertain the cytosol or nucleus localization of the proteins. In addition, in Fig3E, PhIL1 is barely visible. The authors should optimize the brightness/contrast of the images. Alternatively, they may consider using black on white display, which provides better contrast. The authors should mention in the manuscript their interpretation for the lower signal of GAP45/CDPK1, which is due to loss of protein concentration at the IMC.</p><p>2) line 480-481: the text indicates treatment with IAA for 12h, which should prevent schizont formation. This is inconsistent with figure 6 where segmented schizonts are visible. This is also not consistent with the rebuttal, where the authors explain that 2BP treatment was applied to schizonts. This must be clarified and timing of treatment should be specified for each experiment shown. The authors should add the timing of 2-BP treatment in the figure legends for Fig3E, Figure 5E and 5I, and Figure 6C.</p><p>3) Figure 6C-D: the authors should optimize the brightness/contrast of the images. Alternatively, they may consider using black on white display, which provides better contrast.</p><p>4) The authors state in their rebuttal that &quot;For better understanding, we added the information of ISP1 stage expression at the legend of Figure 2A in the revised manuscript.&quot; Please check that this information is included in the text.</p><p>5) Figure 1 supplt 2 panel A still refers to ISP1 &quot;signal peptide&quot;.</p><p>6) The supplemental table with primers should be labelled S3 not S2</p><p>7) The U-ExM and immune-EM data strengthen the conclusion that CDPK1 is localized at the IMC and should be included in the manuscript. The authors convincingly show that CDKP1 is likely at the IMC rather that at the plasma membrane (PM) using both immuno-EM and U-ExM. These data are a strong addition to the paper since all the previous literature claim that CDPK1 is at the PM and therefore not at a place where it can be palmitoylated by the IMC-embedded DHHC2. The authors should add the immuno-EM and U-ExM data as a supplementary figure.</p><p>8) The GFP N-terminal tagging experiments provide important controls and strengthen the conclusion that C156, C158, C169 and C172 are involved in IMC localization via palmitoylation. These data should be included in the manuscript (as a supplemental figure).</p><p>9) The arrowhead pointing at the &quot;only GAP45&quot; dot is barely visible in figure 4I.</p></body></sub-article><sub-article article-type="reply" id="sa2"><front-stub><article-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.77447.sa2</article-id><title-group><article-title>Author response</article-title></title-group></front-stub><body><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Reviewer #1 (Recommendations for the authors):</p><p>The study identifies a large number of putative IMC proteins, with only partial overlap with other studies performed in <italic>P. falciparum</italic>.

The authors should explain how they selected the 14 candidate proteins. This is important to ensure the absence of bias. Do these proteins correspond to the 22 proteins with assigned GO term IMC (line 219)?

In this study, only the N-terminal 20 residues of ISP1, as an IMC targeting peptide, was used to direct the TurboID ligase localizing at the schizont IMC for PL of IMC proteins. Therefore, it is reasonable that ISP1 could not be identified in the PL. For better understanding, we added the information of ISP1 stage expression at the legend of Figure 2A in the revised manuscript.

In another unpublished work of “Discovery of novel proteins within the <italic>Plasmodium falciparum</italic> inner membrane complex” by Prof. Jeffrey Dvorin’s lab in the Page 56 of abstract book of the Molecular Parasitology Meeting 2020 (see the screenshot below), they performed a co-IP using the IMC protein PfIMC1g (PF3D7_0525800) as bait followed by unbiased mass spectrometry to identify IMC1g-binding partners. The protein of PF3D7_1310700 was identified among the top hits and was further validated to localize to IMC by confocal microscopy.

Furthermore, the C140A mutation seemed to have little effect on the IMC localization of GFP-GAP45(30-184) while either C156A/C158A or C169A/C172A mutation impaired the IMC localization of GFP-GAP45(30-184), which are consistent with the results of the HA-tagged GAP45 mutants shown in the Figure 7B. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="sa2fig1">Author response image 1</xref> shows the results (not included in the revised manuscript).</p><fig id="sa2fig1" position="float"><label>Author response image 1.</label><graphic mimetype="image" mime-subtype="tiff" xlink:href="elife-77447-sa2-fig1-v3.tif"/></fig><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Reviewer #3 (Recommendations for the authors):</p><p>1. While the paper contains a substantial amount of data, it feels like two independent stories that are not as well connected as they could be. The proximity labelling identifies a number of new IMC proteins, many of which are likely palmitoylated. But then rather than probing these deeper, the authors switch to focus on DHHC2 and its role in the trafficking and function of two well-known IMC protein targets. However, this is still a strong paper and an important contribution to the field.</p></disp-quote><p>Thanks for the reviewer’s nice comments.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>2. Line 22. The authors claim that &quot;19 of the 22 selected targets were confirmed to localize to the IMC&quot;. This is somewhat disingenuous as 8 of these were already known IMC proteins. Of the remaining 14 that were chosen for verification (lines 248-252) – were they randomly selected or were certain criteria applied in the selection process? (e.g. predicted palmitoylation, IMC in <italic>T. gondii</italic> [Rab11B], etc). This should be clarified.</p></disp-quote><p>In the initial manuscript, we chosen 22 hits for their protein subcellular localization test.

These hits were chosen basically in a random manner, but they showed various (high, middle, and low) levels at the enrichment ratio in the PL experiments (Figure 2A).

In the revised Figure 4I, we labeled an arrow for the sporadic “separate GAP45 spot”. This “only-GAP45” dot could be attributed by the difference in protein stain efficiency for DHHC2 and GAP45.
