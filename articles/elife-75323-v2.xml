the auditory nerve. Because of physical limitations on the precision of this stimulation, the acoustic information delivered by a cochlear implant does not convey the same level of acoustic detail as that conveyed by normal hearing. As a result, speech understanding in listeners with cochlear implants is typically poorer and more effortful than in listeners with normal hearing. The brain networks supporting speech understanding in listeners with cochlear implants are not well understood, partly due to difficulties obtaining functional neuroimaging data in this population. In the current study, we assessed the brain regions supporting spoken word understanding in adult listeners with right unilateral cochlear implants (n=20) and matched controls (n=18) using high-density diffuse optical tomography (HD-DOT), a quiet and non-invasive imaging modality with spatial resolution comparable to that of functional MRI. We found that while listening to spoken words in quiet, listeners with cochlear implants showed greater activity in the left prefrontal cortex than listeners with normal hearing, specifically in a region engaged in a separate spatial working memory task. These results suggest that listeners with cochlear implants require greater cognitive processing during speech understanding than listeners with normal hearing, supported by compensatory recruitment of the left prefrontal cortex.</p></abstract><kwd-group kwd-group-type="author-keywords"><kwd>speech perception</kwd><kwd>diffuse optical tomography</kwd><kwd>cochlear implant</kwd><kwd>fNIRS</kwd><kwd>HD-DOT</kwd></kwd-group><kwd-group kwd-group-type="research-organism"><title>Research organism</title><kwd>Human</kwd></kwd-group><funding-group><award-group id="fund1"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000002</institution-id><institution>National Institutes of Health</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>R21DC015884</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Peelle</surname><given-names>Jonathan E</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund2"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000002</institution-id><institution>National Institutes of Health</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>R21DC016086</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Peelle</surname><given-names>Jonathan E</given-names></name><name><surname>Culver</surname><given-names>Joseph P</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund3"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000002</institution-id><institution>National Institutes of Health</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>K01MH103594</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Eggebrecht</surname><given-names>Adam T</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund4"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000002</institution-id><institution>National Institutes of Health</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>R21MH109775</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Eggebrecht</surname><given-names>Adam T</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund5"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000002</institution-id><institution>National Institutes of Health</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>R01NS090874</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Culver</surname><given-names>Joseph P</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund6"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000002</institution-id><institution>National Institutes of Health</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>R01NS109487</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Culver</surname><given-names>Joseph P</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund7"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000002</institution-id><institution>National Institutes of Health</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>R01DC019507</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Peelle</surname><given-names>Jonathan E</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><funding-statement>The funders had no role in study design, data collection and interpretation, or the decision to submit the work for publication.</funding-statement></funding-group><custom-meta-group><custom-meta specific-use="meta-only"><meta-name>Author impact statement</meta-name><meta-value>The use of high-density optical brain imaging in listeners with cochlear implants shows increased activity in frontal cortex during speech perception compared to those with normal hearing.</meta-value></custom-meta></custom-meta-group></article-meta></front><body><sec id="s1" sec-type="intro"><title>Introduction</title><p>Cochlear implants (CIs) are neuroprosthetic devices that can restore hearing in people with severe to profound hearing loss by electrically stimulating the auditory nerve. Because of physical limitations on the precision of this stimulationâincluding, for example, the spatial spread of electrical current (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Garcia et al., 2021</xref>)âthe auditory stimulation delivered by a CI does not convey the same level of acoustic detail as normal hearing. As a result, speech understanding in listeners with CIs is poorer than in listeners with normal hearing (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Firszt et al., 2004</xref>). Notably, even in quiet, listeners with CIs report increased effort during listening (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Dwyer and Firszt, 2014</xref>). Despite these challenges, many listeners with CIs attain significant success in understanding auditory speech. This remarkable success raises the question of how listeners with CIs make sense of a degraded acoustic signal.</p><p>One area of key importance is understanding the degree to which listeners with CIs rely on non-linguistic cognitive mechanisms to compensate for a degraded acoustic signal. In listeners with normal hearing, cognitive demands increase when speech is acoustically challenging (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">Peelle, 2018</xref>). For example, even when speech is completely intelligible, acoustically degraded speech can reduce later memory for what has been heard (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Cousins et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Koeritzer et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib42">Rabbitt, 1968</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib61">Ward et al., 2016</xref>). These findings suggest that to understand acoustically challenging speech, listeners need to engage domain-general cognitive resources during perception. In a limited capacity cognitive system (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib65">Wingfield, 2016</xref>), such recruitment necessarily reduces the resources available for other tasks, including memory encoding. Importantly, even speech presented in quiet (i.e., without background noise) is degraded by the time it reaches the auditory system of a listener with a CI.</p><p>Cognitive demands during speech understanding are supported by several brain networks that supplement classic frontotemporal language regions. The cingulo-opercular network, for example, is engaged during particularly challenging speech (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Eckert et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib60">Vaden et al., 2017</xref>) and supports successful comprehension during difficult listening (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib59">Vaden et al., 2013</xref>). Recruitment of prefrontal cortex (PFC) complements that in the cingulo-opercular network and varies parametrically with speech intelligibility (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Davis and Johnsrude, 2003</xref>). Activity in PFC, particularly dorsolateral regions, is associated with cognitive demands in a wide range of tasks (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Duncan, 2010</xref>), consistent with domain-general cognitive control (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Braver, 2012</xref>). We thus hypothesized that listeners with CIs would rely more on PFC during listening than listeners with normal hearing, and in particular regions of PFC associated with non-linguistic tasks. However, the functional anatomy of PFC is also complex (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">Noyce et al., 2017</xref>), and dissociating nearby language and domain-general processing regions is challenging (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Fedorenko et al., 2012</xref>).</p><p>A central question concerns the degree to which listeners with CIs rely on cognitive processing outside core speech regions, such as dorsolateral PFC. Obtaining precise spatially localized images of regional brain activity has been difficult in listeners with CIs, given that functional MRI (fMRI) is not possible (or subject to artifact) due to the CI hardware. Thus, optical brain imaging (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Peelle, 2017</xref>) has become a method of choice for studying functional activity in CI listeners (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Anderson et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Lawler et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Lawrence et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">Olds et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib69">Zhou et al., 2018</xref>). In the current study, we use high-density diffuse optical tomography (HD-DOT) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Eggebrecht et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib68">Zeff et al., 2007</xref>), previously validated in speech studies in listeners with normal hearing (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Hassanpour et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Hassanpour et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib46">Schroeder et al., 2020</xref>). HD-DOT provides high spatial resolution and homogenous sensitivity over a field of view that captures known speech-related brain regions (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib62">White and Culver, 2010</xref>). We examine the brain regions supporting single word processing in listeners with a right unilateral CI relative to that in a group of matched, normal-hearing controls. We hypothesized that listeners with CIs would exhibit greater recruitment of PFC compared to normal-hearing controls.</p></sec><sec id="s2" sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><sec id="s2-1"><title>Multi-session single-subject results</title><p>Due to the variability across CI users and difficulties in defining single-subject regions of interest (ROIs), we performed a small multi-session study from one CI subject for six sessions (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1</xref>).

We found minimal overlap between the CI-related signal loss and the right auditory ROI (Appendix 2). We also performed an additional simulation analysis by first calculating the mean value of optical light power for each measurement. Then, for each source-detector location, we defined the approximate coupling coefficient as the mean over the first nearest neighbor measurements that have that source or detector in common. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s1">Figure 3âfigure supplements 1</xref>â<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s2">2</xref> show the coupling coefficients of each source and detector for all CI users and controls in the flat view, corrected by the average sensitivity of the avalanche photodiode detectors (APDs) plotted on a log base 10 scale to create linearly distributed color scale.

We found that relative to controls, when listening to words in quiet, listeners with CIs showed reduced activity in the right auditory cortex andâcriticallyâincreased activity in left PFC. We review these two findings in turn below.</p><sec id="s3-1"><title>Increased PFC activity in CI users</title><p>When listening to spoken words in quiet, listeners with normal hearing typically engage the left and right superior temporal cortex, including primary and secondary auditory regions (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Binder et al., 2000</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib41">Price et al., 1992</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib44">Rogers et al., 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib63">Wiggins et al., 2016</xref>). Our current results for controls show this same pattern. However, when listeners with CIs performed the same task, we found that they also engaged left PFC significantly more than the controls.</p><p>Although we only tested a single level of speech difficulty (i.e., speech in quiet), prior studies have parametrically varied speech intelligibility and found intelligibility-dependent responses in the PFC. Use of several types of signal degradation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Davis and Johnsrude, 2003</xref>) revealed a classic âinverted-Uâ shape response in the PFC as a function of speech intelligibility, with activity increasing until the speech became very challenging and then tapering off. A similar pattern was reported in functional near-infrared spectroscopy (fNIRS) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Lawrence et al., 2018</xref>).</p><p>A pervasive challenge for understanding the role of PFC in speech understanding is the close anatomical relationship of core language processing regions and domain-general regions of PFC (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Fedorenko et al., 2012</xref>). We attempted to add some degree of functional specificity to our interpretation by including a spatial working memory task presumed to strongly engage domain-general regions with minimal reliance on language processing (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Duncan, 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib66">Woolgar et al., 2015</xref>). Ideally, we would have used functional ROIs individually created for each subject. However, we were not convinced that our data for this task were sufficiently reliable at the single-subject level, as we only had one run per subject. Furthermore, we did not have spatial working memory task data for all subjects. Thus, our functional localization relies on group-average spatial working memory responses. The region we identifiedâcentered in left inferior frontal sulcusâcorresponds well to other investigations of non-language tasks (e.g., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Duncan, 2010</xref>), and supports our preferred interpretation of engagement of domain-general regions of dorsolateral PFC during listening. However, the ROI also extends into the dorsal portion of inferior frontal gyrus (IFG), and we cannot rule out the possibility that this frontal activity relates to increased language (as opposed to domain-general) processing.</p></sec><sec id="s3-2"><title>Reduced auditory cortical activity in CI users</title><p>We found reduced activity in the right auditory cortex in CI users relative to controls, which we attribute to differences in auditory stimulation. We limited our sample to CI listeners with unilateral right-sided implants but did not restrict left ear hearing. Most of our subjects with CIs had poor hearing in their left ears, which would result in reduced auditory information being passed to the contralateral (right) auditory cortex. This was as opposed to controls who had bilateral hearing. Prior fNIRS studies have also shown that activity in the superior temporal cortex corresponds with stimulation and comprehension (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">Olds et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib69">Zhou et al., 2018</xref>). We also leave open the possibility that the CI hardware in the right hemisphere interfered with the signal strength, although our simulation studies suggest this cannot fully explain the group differences (Appendix 2 and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s1">Figure 3âfigure supplements 1</xref>â<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s3">3</xref>).</p><p>What is potentially more interesting is the hint at a lower level of activity in the left auditory cortex of the CI users compared to controls, even though all CI listeners were receiving adequate stimulation of their right auditory nerve with a right CI. There are several possible explanations for this finding. First, activity in superior temporal cortex does not reflect only âbasicâ auditory stimulation, but processing related to speech sounds, word meaning, and other levels of linguistic analysis. Thus, although subjects with CIs were certainly receiving stimulation and speech intelligibility scores were generally good, some variability was still present (mean speech perception score in quiet = 0.88, SD = 0.09). The overall level of speech processing was significantly (p=0.00005) lower for CI users than controls (mean speech perception score = 0.99, SD = 0.01), resulting in decreased activity (indeed, because the depth of HD-DOT includes only about 1 cm of the brain, much of primary auditory cortex is not present in our field of view, and the observed group differences were localized in non-primary regions of STG and MTG).</p><p>Perhaps the most provocative explanation is that a reduction in top-down modulatory processes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Davis and Johnsrude, 2007</xref>) plays out as reduced activity in the temporal cortex. That is, given that effortful listening depends on attention (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib64">Wild et al., 2012</xref>), it might be that processes related to top-down prediction (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Cope et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib53">Sohoglu et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib54">Sohoglu et al., 2014</xref>) are muted when too much cognitive control is required for perceptual analysis. Reconciling this interpretation with predictive coding accounts of speech perception (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Blank and Davis, 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib55">Sohoglu and Davis, 2020</xref>) will require additional work. We emphasize that the group differences in left auditory regions were not significant, and thus our interpretation is speculative.</p></sec><sec id="s3-3"><title>Individual differences in PFC activation during spoken word recognition</title><p>Because of the variability of outcomes in CI users (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Firszt et al., 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Holden et al., 2013</xref>), one promising thought is that individual differences in brain activation may help explain variability in speech perception ability. Although our study was not powered for individual difference analysis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib67">Yarkoni and Braver, 2010</xref>), we conducted exploratory correlations to investigate this avenue of inquiry. Interestingly, we saw a trend such that poorer hearing in the left (non-CI) ear was correlated with increased activity in PFC. Our subjects with CIs had significant variability in left ear hearing. Because the speech task was conducted using loudspeakers, we would expect both ears to contribute to accurate perception. Thus, poorer hearing in the left ear would create a greater acoustic challenge, with a correspondingly greater drain on cognitive resources. This interpretation will need additional data to be properly tested.</p></sec><sec id="s3-4"><title>Comparison with previous fNIRS studies in CI users</title><p>Due to limitations of using fMRI and EEG in studying CI users, fNIRS-based neuroimaging is an attractive method for studying the neural correlates of speech perception in this population (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Hassanpour et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Lawler et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib45">Saliba et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib47">Sevy et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib69">Zhou et al., 2018</xref>). Some prior studies have looked at relationships of behavioral performance and brain activity in CI users. For example, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">Olds et al., 2016</xref>, studied temporal lobe activity and showed that both normal hearing and CI users with good speech perception exhibited greater cortical activations to natural speech than to unintelligible speech. In contrast, CI users with poor speech perception had large, indistinguishable cortical activations to all stimuli. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib69">Zhou et al., 2018</xref>, found that regions of temporal and frontal cortex had significantly different mean activation levels in response to auditory speech in CI listeners compared with normal-hearing listeners, and these activation levels were negatively correlated with CI usersâ auditory speech understanding.</p><p>Our current study differs in that we were able to simultaneously measure responses in temporal and frontal lobes with a high-density array. Our finding of increased recruitment of left PFC in CI listeners is broadly consistent with the recruitment of PFC in fNIRS studies in normal-hearing participants listening to simulated distorted speech (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Defenderfer et al., 2021</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Lawrence et al., 2018</xref>). Potential differences in anatomical localization could reflect the difference between the type of the distortion created by an actual CI compared to simulated degraded speech listening scenarios in the previous studies, or in source localization accuracy across different imaging hardware. To our knowledge, our study is the first fNIRS-based study to use a non-verbal spatial working memory task for localizing the PFC ROI in the same population, and it may be that increased use of cross-domain functional localizers will prove to be a useful approach in future work.</p></sec><sec id="s3-5"><title>Caveats, considerations, and future directions</title><p>As with all fNIRS-based functional brain imaging, our ability to image neural activity is limited by the placement of sources and detectors, and in depth to approximately 1 cm of the cortex. Our HD-DOT cap covers the regions of superficial cortex commonly identified in fMRI studies of speech processing, including bilateral superior (STG) and middle temporal gyri (MTG), and pars triangularis of the left IFG (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Davis and Johnsrude, 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib43">Rodd et al., 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib44">Rogers et al., 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib64">Wild et al., 2012</xref>). We also have good coverage of occipital cortex and middle frontal gyrus. However, in the present study we do not image pars opercularis of the IFG, the cerebellum, or any subcortical structures. Thus, it is certainly possible that additional regions not identified here play different roles in understanding speech for CI listeners, a possibility that will require fNIRS setups with improved cortical coverage and converging evidence from other methods to explore.</p><p>We also note that some care should be taken in the degree to which we have identified PFC. As we have pointed out, the functional organization of the frontal cortex is complex and differs from person to person; in particular, fMRI studies have demonstrated that regions responding to language and non-language tasks lie nearby each other (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Fedorenko et al., 2012</xref>). Although we attempted to improve the interpretation of our results by using a functional localizer, we were not able to define subject-specific ROIs, which would be preferable. Future work with single-subject localizers and functional ROIs is needed to more clearly resolve this issue.</p><p>Cognitive demand during speech understanding frequently comes up in discussions of effortful listening (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">Pichora-Fuller et al., 2016</xref>). Although understandable, it is important to keep in mind that the construct of listening effort is not clearly defined (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib58">Strand et al., 2021</xref>) and different measures of âeffortâ do not always agree with each other (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib57">Strand et al., 2018</xref>). Here, we interpret increased activity in PFC as reflecting greater cognitive demand. Although we did not include an independent measure of cognitive challenge, we note that simulated CI speech (i.e., noise-vocoded speech) is associated with delayed word recognition (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">McMurray et al., 2017</xref>) and poorer memory for what has been heard (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib61">Ward et al., 2016</xref>), consistent with increased dependence on shared cognitive processes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">Piquado et al., 2010</xref>). Relating activity in PFC to cognitive demand is also consistent with <italic>decreased</italic> activity in PFC when speech becomes unintelligible (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Davis and Johnsrude, 2003</xref>).</p><p>Finally, we emphasize that in the current study we only measured responses to speech in quiet. Everyday communication frequently occurs in the presence of background noise, which can be particularly challenging for many listeners with CIs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Firszt et al., 2004</xref>). Exploring how activity in PFC and other regions fluctuates in response to speech at various levels of background noise would be a highly interesting future extension of this work. Based on parametric modulations of acoustic challenge in listeners with normal hearing, we might expect increasing activity in PFC as speech gets more challenging (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Davis and Johnsrude, 2003</xref>), followed by cingulo-opercular activity once intelligibility is significantly hampered (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib59">Vaden et al., 2013</xref>).</p><p>In summary, using high-density optical neuroimaging, we found increased activity in PFC in listeners with CIs compared to listeners with normal hearing while listening to words in quiet. Our findings are consistent with a greater reliance on domain-general cognitive processing and provide a potential framework for the cognitive effort that many CI users need to expend during speech perception.</p></sec></sec><sec id="s4" sec-type="materials|methods"><title>Materials and methods</title><sec id="s4-1"><title>Subjects</title><p>We recruited 21 adult CI patients aged 26â79 years (17 right-handed, 2 left-handed, 2 not available), and 19 age- and sex-matched controls (18 right-handed, 1 left-handed) (demographic information in <xref ref-type="table" rid="table1">Table 1</xref>).

Each run for the spatial working memory task was about 8 min, with a total of 48 trials in the run (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5A</xref>, right panel).</p></sec><sec id="s4-4"><title>Data processing</title><p>HD-DOT data were pre-processed using the NeuroDOT toolbox (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Eggebrecht and Culver, 2019</xref>). Source-detector pair light level measurements were converted to log-ratio by calculating the temporal mean of a given source-detector pair measurement as the baseline for that measurement. Noisy measurements were empirically defined as those that had greater than 7.5% temporal standard deviation in the least noisy (lowest mean motion) 60 s of each run (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Eggebrecht et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib51">Sherafati et al., 2020</xref>). The data were next high pass filtered at 0.02 Hz. The global superficial signal was estimated as the average across the first nearest neighbor measurements (13 mm source-detector pair separation) and regressed from all measurement channels (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Gregg et al., 2010</xref>). The optical density time-traces were then low pass filtered with a cutoff frequency of 0.5 Hz to the physiological brain signal band and temporally downsampled from 10 to 1 Hz. A wavelength-dependent forward model of light propagation was computed using an anatomical atlas including the non-uniform tissue structures: scalp, skull, CSF, gray matter, and white matter (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Ferradal et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5C</xref>). The sensitivity matrix was inverted to calculate relative changes in absorption at the two wavelengths via reconstruction using Tikhonov regularization and spatially variant regularization (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Eggebrecht et al., 2014</xref>). Relative changes in the concentrations of oxygenated, deoxygenated, and total hemoglobin (ÎHbO, HbR, ÎHbT) were then obtained from the absorption coefficient changes by the spectral decomposition of the extinction coefficients of oxygenated and deoxygenated hemoglobin at the two wavelengths (750 and 850 nm). After post-processing, we resampled all data to a 3 Ã 3 Ã 3 mm<sup>3</sup> standard atlas using a linear affine transformation for group analysis. In addition to the standard HD-DOT pre-processing steps used in the NeuroDOT toolbox, we used a comprehensive data quality assessment pipeline (see Appendix 1) to exclude the subjects with low pulse SNR or high motion levels.</p><p>After pre-processing, the response for the speech task was estimated using a standard general linear model (GLM) framework. The design matrix was constructed using onsets and durations of each stimulus presentation convolved with a canonical hemodynamic response function (HRF). This HRF was created using a two-gamma function (2 s delay time, 7 s time to peak, and 17 s undershoot) fitted to the HD-DOT data described in a previous study (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Hassanpour et al., 2015</xref>). We included both runs for each subject in one design matrix using custom MATLAB scripts (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="app1fig2">Appendix 1âfigure 2</xref>).</p><p>For modeling the spatial working memory task, we used a design matrix with two columns representing easy and hard conditions. The duration of each easy or hard trial was modeled as the total time of stimulus presentation and evaluation. Events were convolved with the same canonical HRF described in the spoken word perception task to model hemodynamic responses (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Hassanpour et al., 2014</xref>). We used the easy+hard response maps as a reference for defining the PFC ROI, which was more robust than the hard&gt;easy contrast previously used for younger populations.</p><p>After estimating the response (Î² map) for each subject for each task, we performed a second-level analysis in SPM12 (Wellcome Trust Centre for Neuroimaging) version 7487 (RRID:<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://identifiers.org/RRID/RRID:SCR_007037">SCR_007037</ext-link>). Extracted time-traces for each subject were then calculated using a finite impulse response model.</p><p>We only present the ÎHbO results in the main figures as we have found that the ÎHbO signal exhibits a higher contrast-to-noise ratio compared to ÎHbR or ÎHbT (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Eggebrecht et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Hassanpour et al., 2014</xref>).</p></sec><sec id="s4-5"><title>Functionally defined ROIs</title><p>To perform a more focused comparison between controls and CI users, we defined three ROIs, independent from our spoken word recognition dataset, for statistical analysis.</p><p>To accurately localize the elevated PFC activation in the CI group, we collected HD-DOT data from nine subjects (four controls and five CI users in 13 sessions) using a spatial working memory task (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Fedorenko et al., 2012</xref>). The visual spatial working memory task robustly activates PFC due to its working memory demands (and visual cortex because of its visual aspect). We chose this task to localize the PFC ROI for performing an ROI-based statistical analysis between controls and CI users. Our logic is that in prior work this task shows activity that dissociates from nearby language-related activity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Fedorenko et al., 2012</xref>), and thus the region of PFC localized by this task is more likely to reflect domain-general processing (as opposed to language-specific processing). Our results show strong bilateral visual and PFC activations in response to this task (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6A</xref> left). We then defined the left PFC ROI as the cluster of activation in the left PFC (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6A</xref> right). This region was centered in inferior frontal sulcus, extending into both dorsal IFG and inferior MFG. The location is broadly consistent with domain-general (âmultiple demandâ) activation (e.g., meta-analysis in <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Duncan, 2010</xref>).</p><fig id="fig6" position="float"><label>Figure 6.</label><caption><title>Defining functional regions of interest (ROIs).</title><p>(<bold>A</bold>) Spatial working memory activation for five CI users and four controls over 13 sessions.

We defined the left and right auditory ROIs by selecting a 5 mm radius seed in the contralateral hemisphere and finding the Pearson correlation between the time-series of the seed region with all other voxels in the field of view. Correlation maps in individuals were Fisher z-transformed and averaged across subjects (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6BâC</xref>, left). Right/left auditory ROIs were defined by masking the correlation map to include only the right/left hemisphere (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6BâC</xref> right). These ROIs extend well beyond primary auditory cortex, which is important to capture responses to words often observed in lateral regions of STG and MTG.</p></sec><sec id="s4-6"><title>Speech perception score</title><p>To measure auditory-only speech perception accuracy, we presented each participant with two lists of AzBio sentences in quiet (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib56">Spahr et al., 2012</xref>) (except one participant who only heard one set).

For unaided testing, a value of 120 dB was assigned if there was no response at a given frequency; for aided or CI testing, a value of 75 dB was used. For CI users, hearing was tested with the right ear CI alone, left ear alone unaided, and left ear with a hearing aid, if worn at the time of testing. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s1">Figure 4âfigure supplement 1</xref> shows the audiograms for both controls and CI users.</p></sec><sec id="s4-8"><title>Quantification and statistical analysis</title><p>Based on prior optical neuroimaging studies with similar speech-related tasks (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Defenderfer et al., 2021</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Eggebrecht et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Hassanpour et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">Pollonini et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib69">Zhou et al., 2018</xref>), we anticipated 15â20 subjects per group would be sufficient to detect a moderate effect size while also within our resource limitations. We therefore aimed to have at least 15 subjects in each group. We performed a one-tailed two-sample t-test for our main hypothesis (increased recruitment of PFC in CI users), for which we had a strong directional hypothesis (greater activity in listeners with CIs than controls), and a two-tailed t-test for the left and right auditory cortex changes for which we did not have directional hypotheses. We adjusted for unequal variances for left PFC and right auditory ROIs based on the significance of Leveneâs test.</p></sec></sec></body><back><sec sec-type="additional-information" id="s5"><title>Additional information</title><fn-group content-type="competing-interest"><title>Competing interests</title><fn fn-type="COI-statement" id="conf1"><p>No competing interests declared</p></fn><fn fn-type="COI-statement" id="conf2"><p>Reviewing editor, eLife</p></fn></fn-group><fn-group content-type="author-contribution"><title>Author contributions</title><fn fn-type="con" id="con1"><p>Conceptualization, Data curation, Formal analysis, Methodology, Software, Validation, Visualization, Writing - original draft, Writing â review and editing</p></fn><fn fn-type="con" id="con2"><p>Conceptualization, Data curation, Formal analysis, Investigation, Methodology, Project administration, Visualization, Writing â review and editing</p></fn><fn fn-type="con" id="con3"><p>Investigation, Methodology, Software, Visualization, Writing â review and editing</p></fn><fn fn-type="con" id="con4"><p>Conceptualization, Investigation, Software, Writing â review and editing</p></fn><fn fn-type="con" id="con5"><p>Conceptualization, Investigation, Methodology, Software, Writing â review and editing</p></fn><fn fn-type="con" id="con6"><p>Conceptualization, Formal analysis, Investigation, Methodology, Resources, Supervision, Writing â review and editing</p></fn><fn fn-type="con" id="con7"><p>Conceptualization, Formal analysis, Funding acquisition, Investigation, Methodology, Resources, Supervision, Writing â review and editing</p></fn><fn fn-type="con" id="con8"><p>Conceptualization, Formal analysis, Funding acquisition, Investigation, Methodology, Resources, Supervision, Writing â review and editing</p></fn></fn-group><fn-group content-type="ethics-information"><title>Ethics</title><fn fn-type="other"><p>Human subjects: All subjects were native speakers of English with no self-reported history of neurological or psychiatric disorders.

If the data has a very low heartbeat SNR it indicates that the lower frequencies emergent from the hemodynamic fluctuations might also have a low SNR. Therefore, we excluded the subjects that showed a very low mean pulse SNR across the field of view, as it indicates that their brain signal is also less reliable.</p><p>The underlying reason behind low pulse SNR is either a poor optode-scalp coupling or high levels of motion. If the optode-scalp coupling is good, normally pulse SNR is only low during high-motion (identified as high GVTD) epochs of data. However, if the optode-scalp coupling is poor, we will see low pulse SNR throughout the run. Note that there are not well-studied definitions and cutoffs for the calculation of pulse SNR in fNIRS-based methods. Therefore, since we already regressed time-points contaminated with motion using the GVTD index, here we only exclude the subjects that had a very low mean pulse SNR across the cap compared to other subjects.</p><p>We calculated the pulse SNR using the NeuroDOT function PlotPhysiologyPower.m (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://github.com/WUSTL-ORL/NeuroDOT_Beta">https://github.com/WUSTL-ORL/NeuroDOT_Beta</ext-link>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Eggebrecht and Culver, 2019</xref>).

The following individual involved in the review of your submission has agreed to reveal their identity: Phillip E Gander (Reviewer #2).</p><p>The reviewers have discussed their reviews with one another, and the Reviewing Editor has drafted this to help you prepare a revised submission.</p><p>Essential revisions:</p><p>The authors should address the following major points in a revision that are highlighted in detail in the individual referee reports.</p><p>1. Acknowledgement of and discussion of technical limitations. These are related to the depth of signal and field of view which means that the whole of the network for speech perception is not analysed.</p><p>2. Discussion of task effects. There is an effect shown in the frontal cortex listening to the world in quiet but no measurement of correlates of more challenging listening that might show this with the greatest power or demonstrate additional areas. And although listening effort is invoked to explain the data there are no physiological measurements of this.</p><p>3. Clearer definition and justification of the ROI within which extra activation occurs. The result in the frontal ROI is just significant without correction for multiple comparisons so it is important that the ROI is clearly justified and explained</p><p><italic>Reviewer #1 (Recommendations for the authors):</italic></p><p>I would like the authors to consider these comments. Basically, I think the demonstration of the DLPFC signal increase during speech perception by the CI group supports models based on the use of additional resources beyond the traditional speech network. An issue for me is that the technique does not allow the examination of other candidate areas.</p><p>1. The technique is an advance on fNIRS used previously in terms of spatial resolution but suffers from the same issue with respect to the demonstration of deep sources. This is helpfully shown by the authors in the volumetric field of view diagram in figure 1. The demonstration of the DLPFC involvement in the listening task is robust in the group data including the ROI analysis: this area can be optimally imaged with the technique. The field of view excludes deep parts of the superior temporal plane including the medial parts of the primary auditory cortex and planum temporale behind it, and the deep opercular part of IFG. This prevents the comparison of the signal between CI users and controls in all of the conventional parts of the language network (and other parts of the multiple demand network discussed below).</p><p>2. With respect to the decrease in signal in the left auditory cortex in the CI users I think the interpretation is limited because the medial primary cortex is not imaged. I agree with the authors' suggestion that the change here likely reflects a decrease in high-level processing of speech sounds (in the cortex near the convexity) but the discussion might include acknowledgement of the technical limitation due to field of view.</p><p>3. The demonstration of increased signal in the left DLPFC is the most robust finding here and is interesting in and of itself. This is consistent with the idea advanced by the senior author that more difficult listening engages anterior cingulate, frontal operculum, premotor cortex, DLPFC and parietal cortex (eg PMID: 28938250 figure 3). Of these areas, only the DLPFC is adequately imaged by this technique (although the authors might comment on whether the inferior parietal cortex is within FOV and demonstrated by contrast in figure 4C). The discussion here focuses more on the multiple-demand network idea and uses a WM task similar to Duncan and others to define this but from this perspective the imaging of the deep operculum, frontal lobe and medial frontal lobe is still missing.</p><p>4. I found it hard to interpret the between-subject effect of behavioural scores in figure 6. The effect of left ear hearing (non-CI side) goes in a direction I would predict if the DLPFC signal reflected listening effect and the right ear hearing (CI side) goes in the opposite direction. I guess the range of hearing deficit is broader on the left and this has been emphasised more in the discussion. The authors might comment.</p><p>5. Do the authors have any data on varying behaviour within subjects like presenting the sound in noise? Again, any effect on DLPFC would be interesting. But I think the main point here is the use of a different network as a function of CI use even in quiet.</p><p><italic>Reviewer #2 (Recommendations for the authors):</italic></p><p>1. Hypothesis/results interpretation:</p><p>Can the justification for the hypothesis be unpacked a little more, for this particular case? If challenging listening requires more processing in a wider array of brain regions to take over for greater cognitive demand, for example in DLPFC. And CI users experience greater cognitive demand during listening, one might hypothesize that listening to single words without background noise would be the hardest condition in which to find an effect (despite the finding of Dwyer et al. 2014). Alternatively, one might compare words in quiet with words in noise, since speech in noise understanding is the main complaint of people with hearing loss (especially CI users). And the brain mechanisms required under these conditions might be different to what is a less challenging task. Perhaps the authors wanted to start in the most &quot;trivial&quot; case and test more conditions later.</p><p>Figure 4. The difference t-map has a somewhat loose threshold. Presumably this is because the differences in the frontal cortex would be lost. The authors have previously used more stringent thresholding, but perhaps there is justification here.</p><p>The CI&gt;Control t-map shows the strongest differences in the visual/visual association cortex, auditory cortex. On the left it appears that a relevant frontal activation occurs in the inferior frontal gyrus, as might be predicted from the literature.</p><p>Reduced activation in the left auditory cortex between CI and control could still be due to threshold differences ~5dB (may be significant). Peripheral fidelity is much lower in the CI group, with also poor contribution ipsilaterally.</p><p>The authors propose that lower left auditory cortex activation could also be related to lower speech perception scores, however these scores are drawn from the AzBio test (sentences in noise) which has the potential for indexing very different processes than a word in the quiet test as was the case in this study.</p><p>2. ROI definition:</p><p>Choosing an ROI functionally defined from a spatial WM task to look for overlap in brain regions sharing a putative cognitive process is unclear if the comparison is a verbal task. If the goal was to find common cognitive resources the referenced paper by Federenko and colleagues achieved such a goal, providing an ROI with which to test against a common set of cognitive processes. Further, the claim that the task activates a brain region, DLFPC, which does seem to include dorsal aspects of inferior frontal gyrus on pars triangularis. Yet the activation found include this region in this study, while this region of pars triangularis does not appear in the work by Federenko and colleagues leave the reader confused about why these differences would exist, unless it was for other reasons, like localization differences between HD-DOT and fMRI.</p><p>The results might change considerably if anatomical ROIs were used instead, i.e., IFG or a DLPFC ROI.</p><p>It is fine to use the logic that one task (A) primarily indexes cognitive function X (hopefully) and let's see if another task (B) also shares some of that presumed function by masking B with A. That shows (hopefully) that the functions are shared across tasks. In this case, the function of (spatial) working memory is shared between a spatial working memory and speech task in CI users.</p><p>DLPFC is an anatomical label, not a functional one. In this case, the authors have used a functional ROI and so need to name it as such, e.g., 'WM', while reference to the term DLPFC is not helpful and should be removed from the manuscript (and title) except perhaps in the discussion.</p><p>Line 194. It is slightly confusing to define auditory ROIs from a fMRI resting state paradigm. The referenced paper used a 'word listening' activation for both fMRI and HD-DOT. So are the authors using the acoustic word task rather than rest? And further, if there is data using HD-DOT with a similar paradigm then that might be a more sensible ROI definition?</p><p>Line 195-199. The procedure for the definition of the ROI is not clearly motivated, in particular, because the data are obtained from a previous publication which displays thresholded values (at least for the auditory task) that clearly defines the auditory cortex. A correlational approach might (appropriately) be very broad and include areas outside of 'canonical' auditory temporal cortex. Was this intended? What was the threshold for the correlation?</p><p>Line 240-245. This text implies the ROI was defined with the current data set rather than another as written in the methods. Please clarify.</p><p>Figure 3A. The 'DLPFC' ROI seems to have a large proportion of the cluster within pars triangularis, which is not quite the same as the fMRI overlap representation in Figure 2 of Federnko et al. 2013, in which the bulk of activation is within the middle frontal gyrus.</p><p>3. HD-DOT sensitivity:</p><p>As stated in the referenced White and Culver paper: &quot;The high-density array has an effective resolution of about 1.3 cm, which should prevent identification to the wrong gyrus.&quot;</p><p>This means that localization errors to middle frontal gyrus, as opposed to inferior frontal gyrus, could be a concern in this case in which the activation appears to be across a sulcal boundary.</p><p>Figure 1. The sensitivity profile appears to show that greater sensitivity exists for the superior aspect of inferior frontal gyrus and inferior aspect of the middle frontal gyrus (and visual cortex). Is that a simple misinterpretation from the figure? Or do the authors know of issues with respect to the HD-DOT technique weighting responses to the regions of greater sensitivity?</p><p>Figure 1 supplement. Is it possible there may be some concern about the drop in signal on the right due to variability in the location of the CI transducer across participants? Is it possible the drop in signal in right middle/superior temporal and inferior frontal is also due to loss of measurement here across the group of CI users?</p><p>Specific comments:</p><p>1. Lines 56-57: Please clarify. Are you saying that listening to degraded input reduces the ability for certain other processing, for instance, performance on a second task that involves memory encoding? Or is it that memory encoding on the speech is limited, or both? It is not entirely clear from the text.</p><p>2. What kind of CI device? Since it is not specified, I assume this is a standard length implant and not one for hearing preservation.</p><p>3. What was the distribution of CI duration? Is it possible there may be some people under 1 year of use? If so this may be difficult with respect to interpretation for those users, since their performance with the device may not be their best, i.e., they may still yet improve. This process of adaptation to the implant could easily involve different brain regions other than measured in this study, or a different weighting depending on adaptation.</p><p>4. Similarly, does the range of unaided hearing in the CI group get to the level of some &quot;functional&quot; residual hearing, or does the skew go to higher thresholds? If there are people with PTAs of ~60 they may perform differently than people without functional residual hearing? Perhaps residual hearing could be added as a covariate to the analyses.</p><p>There may also be clues based on performance on the AzBio task. Is there a relationship between residual hearing and AzBio score? The thrust of these questions is that residual hearing likely has an impact on performance, which similarly may influence brain mechanisms.</p><p>5. Figure 1. The Spatial WM task appears to have multiple components within it that would be beyond just WM, for example, reward (from the feedback), decision making, response execution, which would all be tied into the level of temporal resolution of the imaging technique. This might temper conclusions about WM per se.</p><p>6. Visual activation appears only on the left, which is unclear (compare to Figure 3A). Was the display directly in-front of the participant, or something about their vision?</p><p>7. Figure 1. In the spatial working memory task the wait time range of 4000-250ms is unclear.</p><p>8.

Acknowledgement of and discussion of technical limitations. These are related to the depth of signal and field of view which means that the whole of the network for speech perception is not analysed.</p></disp-quote><p>Thank you for encouraging us to clarify the limitations in our approach. Of course, we completely agree that though we have good coverage relative to other optical neuroimaging approaches, we do not cover the full brain, and there are indeed brain regions we might expect to be involved in speech perception that we do not image. We have added the following to the Discussion:</p><p>âAs with all fNIRS-based functional neuroimaging, our ability to image neural activity is limited by the placement of sources and detectors, and in depth to approximately 1 cm of the cortex. Our HD-DOT cap covers the regions of superficial cortex commonly identified in fMRI studies of speech processing, including bilateral superior and middle temporal gyri, and pars triangularis of the left inferior frontal gyrus (Davis and Johnsrude 2003; Rodd, Davis, and Johnsrude 2005; Rogers et al. 2020; Wild et al. 2012). We also have good coverage of occipital cortex and middle frontal gyrus. However, in the present study we do not image pars opercularis of the inferior frontal gyrus, the cerebellum, or any subcortical structures. Thus, it is certainly possible that additional regions not identified here play different roles in understanding speech for CI listeners, a possibility that will require fNIRS setups with improved cortical coverage and converging evidence from other methods to explore.â</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>2. Discussion of task effects. There is an effect shown in the frontal cortex listening to the world in quiet but no measurement of correlates of more challenging listening that might show this with the greatest power or demonstrate additional areas. And although listening effort is invoked to explain the data there are no physiological measurements of this.</p></disp-quote><p>Thank you for raising these two important points.</p><p>Regarding the first point, it is important to note that both CI simulations (i.e., noise vocoding) and data from CI listeners show difficulty understanding speech in quiet (Willis, Helen; 2018; The feasibility of the dual-task paradigm as a framework for a clinical test of listening effort in cochlear implant users. Doctoral thesis, University College London). Thus, our perspective is that speech may be âin quietâ in the room, but to the auditory system of a listener with a cochlear implant, the acoustic signal is degraded, and it is precisely the brainâs response to that degraded signal we are measuring. We readily agree that further exploring responses to speech in noise (which, of course, is common in everyday listening, and can be particularly challenging for many listeners with cochlear implants) is highly interesting, and we hope a future extension of this work. We now explicitly note these points in the introduction (to clarify the logic behind studying speech in quiet) and in the Discussion:</p><p>âFinally, we emphasize that we report here only responses to speech in quiet. Everyday communication frequently occurs in the presence of background noise, which can be particularly challenging for many listeners with cochlear implants (Firszt et al. 2004). Exploring how activity in PFC and other regions fluctuates in response to speech at various levels of background noise would be a highly interesting future extension of this work. Based on parametric modulations of acoustic challenge in listeners with normal hearing, we might expect increasing activity in PFC as speech gets more challenging (Davis and Johnsrude 2003), followed by cingulo-opercular activity once intelligibility is significantly hampered (Vaden et al. 2013).â</p><p>With respect to the second point, it is entirely correct that we do not have a non-imaging measure of cognitive demand during listening. That being said, we think there are good reasons to think that differences here are driven by a response to acoustic challenge, which we believe falls comfortably under the âlistening effortâ umbrella. However, there are two important clarifications we should make. First, we readily acknowledge that listening effort is not clearly defined (Strand et al., 2020), and in its fullest definition encompasses more than just cognitive challenge (Pichora-Fuller et al., 2016). In fact, in the manuscript we never use the term âlistening effortâ to describe our paradigm for precisely this reason. We have also done our best to explain where our cognitive-demand-centered interpretation comes from. In short, from imaging studies showing parametric responses to acoustic challenge (including noise vocoding) (e.g., Davis and Johnsrude, 2003), behavioral studies showing that acoustic challenge hinders memory for words (Rabbitt, 1968) and stories (Ward et al., 2016); and the many reports of listeners with CIs having difficulty understanding speech (Firszt et al., 2004, McMurray et al. 2017, and many others). We have added these points to the Discussion:</p><p>âCognitive demand during speech understanding frequently comes up in discussions of effortful listening (Pichora-Fuller et al. 2016). Although understandable, it is important to keep in mind that the construct of listening effort is not clearly defined (Strand et al. 2020) and different measures of âeffortâ do not always agree with each other (Strand et al. 2018). Here, we interpret increased activity in PFC as reflecting greater cognitive demand. Although we did not include an independent measure of cognitive challenge, we note that simulated CI speech (i.e., noise-vocoded speech) is associated with delayed word recognition (McMurray, Farris-Trimble, and Rigler 2017) and poorer memory for what has been heard (Ward et al., 2016), consistent with increased dependence on shared cognitive processes (Piquado et al. 2010). Relating activity in PFC to cognitive demand is also consistent with decreased activity in PFC when speech becomes unintelligible (Davis and Johnsrude 2003).â</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>3. Clearer definition and justification of the ROI within which extra activation occurs. The result in the frontal ROI is just significant without correction for multiple comparisons so it is important that the ROI is clearly justified and explained</p></disp-quote><p>Thank you for giving us the opportunity to clarify these important points. We start by discussing the definition and justification for the PFC region of interest, followed by a description of a revised analysis.</p><p>We have added some additional detail to the justification of the prefrontal cortex ROI. The full revised text reads:</p><p>âTo accurately localize the elevated prefrontal cortex activation in the CI group, we collected HD-DOT data from 9 subjects (4 controls and 5 CI users in 13 sessions) using a spatial working memory task (Fedorenko, Duncan, and Kanwisher 2012). The visual spatial working memory task robustly activates PFC due to its working memory demands (and visual cortex because of its visual aspect). We chose this task to localize the PFC ROI for performing an ROI-based statistical analysis between controls and CI users. Our logic is that in prior work this task shows activity that dissociates from that in inferior frontal gyrus (Fedorenko, Duncan, and Kanwisher 2012), and thus the region of PFC localized by this task is more likely to reflect domain-general processing (as opposed to language-specific processing). Our results show strong bilateral visual and PFC activations in response to this task (Figure 6A left). We then defined the left PFC ROI as the cluster of activation in the left PFC region (Figure 6A right). This region was centered in inferior frontal sulcus, extending into both dorsal IFG and inferior MFG. The location is broadly consistent with domain-general (âmultiple demandâ) activation (e.g., meta-analysis in Duncan, 2010).â</p><p>In terms of anatomy, our frontal cortex ROI is centered in the inferior frontal sulcus (IFS), which also corresponds to peak activity in meta analyses of âmultiple demandâ tasksâfor example, in this meta-analysis from Duncan (2010, Trends in Cognitive Science).</p><fig id="sa2fig1" position="float"><label>Author response image 1.</label><graphic mimetype="image" mime-subtype="tiff" xlink:href="elife-75323-sa2-fig1-v2.tif"/></fig><p>Being centered in IFS, there is some overlap with both IFG and MFG. If we trust our source localization, we donât think the IFG overlap is inferior enough to suggest language-related processing, although we concede we do not have definitive evidence for this. The ROI is unquestionably in the prefrontal cortex. In our view, centered in IFS is sufficient for considering this dorsolateral prefrontal cortex. However, we have gone with the more general âprefrontal cortexâ in the title and text of the manuscript because we donât think this point affects our main findings or interpretation.Regarding correction for multiple comparisons, we have revisited this section and clarified that the critical comparison in PFC is corrected for the ROIs looked at.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Reviewer #1 (Recommendations for the authors):</p><p>I would like the authors to consider these comments. Basically, I think the demonstration of the DLPFC signal increase during speech perception by the CI group supports models based on the use of additional resources beyond the traditional speech network. An issue for me is that the technique does not allow the examination of other candidate areas.</p><p>1. The technique is an advance on fNIRS used previously in terms of spatial resolution but suffers from the same issue with respect to the demonstration of deep sources. This is helpfully shown by the authors in the volumetric field of view diagram in figure 1. The demonstration of the DLPFC involvement in the listening task is robust in the group data including the ROI analysis: this area can be optimally imaged with the technique. The field of view excludes deep parts of the superior temporal plane including the medial parts of the primary auditory cortex and planum temporale behind it, and the deep opercular part of IFG. This prevents the comparison of the signal between CI users and controls in all of the conventional parts of the language network (and other parts of the multiple demand network discussed below).</p></disp-quote><p>We acknowledge the limitation of our system field of view in covering the entirety of brain networks involved in speech processing, particularly deep structures. We agree this is an important point, and now note this explicitly in the Discussion.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>2. With respect to the decrease in signal in the left auditory cortex in the CI users I think the interpretation is limited because the medial primary cortex is not imaged. I agree with the authors' suggestion that the change here likely reflects a decrease in high-level processing of speech sounds (in the cortex near the convexity) but the discussion might include acknowledgement of the technical limitation due to field of view.</p></disp-quote><p>This comment is very important and we thank the reviewer for reminding us of this fact. We have added a sentence in the Discussion section to address this point.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>3. The demonstration of increased signal in the left DLPFC is the most robust finding here and is interesting in and of itself. This is consistent with the idea advanced by the senior author that more difficult listening engages anterior cingulate, frontal operculum, premotor cortex, DLPFC and parietal cortex (eg PMID: 28938250 figure 3). Of these areas, only the DLPFC is adequately imaged by this technique (although the authors might comment on whether the inferior parietal cortex is within FOV and demonstrated by contrast in figure 4C). The discussion here focuses more on the multiple-demand network idea and uses a WM task similar to Duncan and others to define this but from this perspective the imaging of the deep operculum, frontal lobe and medial frontal lobe is still missing.</p></disp-quote><p>We focused on the PFC ROI for two reasons. First, our reading of prior fMRI literature (and work from our own group) suggests that when speech is challenging to understand, but still intelligible, increases are seen in many regions of the dorsolateral prefrontal cortex. However, when intelligibility begins to suffer (i.e., errors are introduced), the cingulo-opercular network is engaged (see compelling fMRI work from Eckert, Vaden, and colleagues). Because we were presenting speech in quiet, to CI users with fairly good auditory-only perception, we focused on the PFC activity. As you point out, we also do not have the ability to image deep areasâand so we are not particularly well-suited for studying the cingulo-opercular network.</p><p>We had considered including an inferior parietal ROI, which as you say, is also often implicated in multiple-demand tasks. However, we did not have a clear ROI defined based on our spatial working memory task. Thus, we did not feel justified in including one. (It is also unclear whether our parietal coverage adequately covers IPSâit may, but the absence of strong functional activity here led us to abandon this idea for now.)</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>4. I found it hard to interpret the between-subject effect of behavioural scores in figure 6. The effect of left ear hearing (non-CI side) goes in a direction I would predict if the DLPFC signal reflected listening effect and the right-ear hearing (CI side) goes in the opposite direction. I guess the range of hearing deficit is broader on the left and this has been emphasised more in the discussion. The authors might comment.</p></disp-quote><p>We agree with this comment. We also think that our rather small sample size and the small variability in the right ear hearing levels, makes our PFC correlation with right ear 4fPTA harder to interpret. We added a sentence to state this more clearly in the discussion.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>5. Do the authors have any data on varying behaviour within subjects like presenting the sound in noise? Again, any effect on DLPFC would be interesting. But I think the main point here is the use of a different network as a function of CI use even in quiet.</p></disp-quote><p>Because we have brain imaging data for speech in quiet, we felt that the strongest justification for brain-behavior correlations would be to use behavioral scores from a similar condition.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Reviewer #2 (Recommendations for the authors):</p><p>1. Hypothesis/results interpretation:</p><p>Can the justification for the hypothesis be unpacked a little more, for this particular case? If challenging listening requires more processing in a wider array of brain regions to take over for greater cognitive demand, for example in DLPFC. And CI users experience greater cognitive demand during listening, one might hypothesize that listening to single words without background noise would be the hardest condition in which to find an effect (despite the finding of Dwyer et al. 2014). Alternatively, one might compare words in quiet with words in noise, since speech in noise understanding is the main complaint of people with hearing loss (especially CI users). And the brain mechanisms required under these conditions might be different to what is a less challenging task. Perhaps the authors wanted to start in the most &quot;trivial&quot; case and test more conditions later.</p></disp-quote><p>As we note above, speech in quiet is still degraded from the perspective of the auditory system of a CI user. The brain responses to degraded speech are not uniform, but depend (among other things) on the overall challenge and intelligibility. We focused on speech in quiet to (a) demonstrate differences in processing for listeners with CIs âevenâ in quiet, and (b) to maximize intelligibility, which in our view helps interpretation (i.e., we answer the question: what are listeners doing to understand speech when they are being successful?).</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Figure 4. The difference t-map has a somewhat loose threshold. Presumably this is because the differences in the frontal cortex would be lost. The authors have previously used more stringent thresholding, but perhaps there is justification here.</p></disp-quote><p>Because we had rather specific anatomically-constrained hypotheses, we constructed the study first and foremost around an ROI-based analysis. However, we also thought it was important to show non-ROI results. Hence, in Figure 2 we include unthresholded maps of parameter estimates, and thresholded (but not corrected) t maps. We do this to give a sense of the extent of the data and to be transparent about what is, and isnât showing up at the whole-brain level. It is correct that the result in PFC does not survive correcting for multiple comparisons at the whole brain level.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>The CI&gt;Control t-map shows the strongest differences in the visual/visual association cortex, auditory cortex. On the left it appears that a relevant frontal activation occurs in the inferior frontal gyrus, as might be predicted from the literature.</p><p>Reduced activation in the left auditory cortex between CI and control could still be due to threshold differences ~5dB (may be significant). Peripheral fidelity is much lower in the CI group, with also poor contribution ipsilaterally.</p></disp-quote><p>An additional reason we provide the whole-brain maps is to help readers think about additional hypotheses and guide future research. We agree that activity in IFG is also of interest.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>The authors propose that lower left auditory cortex activation could also be related to lower speech perception scores, however these scores are drawn from the AzBio test (sentences in noise) which has the potential for indexing very different processes than a word in the quiet test as was the case in this study.</p></disp-quote><p>We used the AzBio sentences, but these were presented in quiet to get a measure of speech-in-quiet understanding. We have clarified this in the revised manuscript.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>2. ROI definition:</p><p>Choosing an ROI functionally defined from a spatial WM task to look for overlap in brain regions sharing a putative cognitive process is unclear if the comparison is a verbal task. If the goal was to find common cognitive resources the referenced paper by Federenko and colleagues achieved such a goal, providing an ROI with which to test against a common set of cognitive processes. Further, the claim that the task activates a brain region, DLFPC, which does seem to include dorsal aspects of inferior frontal gyrus on pars triangularis. Yet the activation found include this region in this study, while this region of pars triangularis does not appear in the work by Federenko and colleagues leave the reader confused about why these differences would exist, unless it was for other reasons, like localization differences between HD-DOT and fMRI.</p><p>The results might change considerably if anatomical ROIs were used instead, i.e., IFG or a DLPFC ROI.</p><p>It is fine to use the logic that one task (A) primarily indexes cognitive function X (hopefully) and let's see if another task (B) also shares some of that presumed function by masking B with A.

In this case, the authors have used a functional ROI and so need to name it as such, e.g., 'WM', while reference to the term DLPFC is not helpful and should be removed from the manuscript (and title) except perhaps in the discussion.</p></disp-quote><p>We have updated the term to âprefrontal cortexâ because this region is unambiguously in the prefrontal cortex. In our view, it is in the dorsal and lateral aspect of the prefrontal cortex, which motivated our use of DLPFC. However we acknowledge there is no clear consensus on DLPFC boundaries and we donât find this label critical to our argument.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Line 194. It is slightly confusing to define auditory ROIs from a fMRI resting state paradigm. The referenced paper used a 'word listening' activation for both fMRI and HD-DOT.

In the referenced paper, both word listening and resting state data were presented. We made <xref ref-type="fig" rid="sa2fig2">Author response image 2</xref> to show that there is a large overlap between the left and right auditory ROIs found using the seed based resting state maps and the auditory maps in response to the hearing words task. The dice coefficient between our proposed resting state based ROI and the hearing words based ROI (thresholded at p = 0.05) is 0.7 and the voxelwise similarity of the two is also 0.7. We chose the resting state based ROIs based on fMRI data, because it is independent of any particular task, although we see the alternative logic of using the same task, as well.

The 'DLPFC' ROI seems to have a large proportion of the cluster within pars triangularis, which is not quite the same as the fMRI overlap representation in Figure 2 of Federnko et al. 2013, in which the bulk of activation is within the middle frontal gyrus.</p></disp-quote><p>One strength of using a functional localizer is that our inferences are most strongly driven by the overlap in activity, rather than putative anatomy. Though, we also note that our ROI is centered on IFS, which is often the center of overlap in multiple-demand network studies. However, there certainly could be some anatomical overlap with portions of the IFG.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>3. HD-DOT sensitivity:</p><p>As stated in the referenced White and Culver paper: &quot;The high-density array has an effective resolution of about 1.3 cm, which should prevent identification to the wrong gyrus.&quot;</p><p>This means that localization errors to middle frontal gyrus, as opposed to inferior frontal gyrus, could be a concern in this case in which the activation appears to be across a sulcal boundary.</p></disp-quote><p>Our interpretation of the prefrontal activity in CI users is not based primarily on the anatomical landmark, but by the functional definition of the region (which we interpret in an anatomical context).</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Figure 1. The sensitivity profile appears to show that greater sensitivity exists for the superior aspect of inferior frontal gyrus and inferior aspect of the middle frontal gyrus (and visual cortex). Is that a simple misinterpretation from the figure? Or do the authors know of issues with respect to the HD-DOT technique weighting responses to the regions of greater sensitivity?</p></disp-quote><p>The variation in sensitivity profile proceeds from the arrangement of the sources and detectors. Near the edge of the field of view, sensitivity begins to drop. With our current cap configuration, this does result in small sensitivity differences (Appendix 2â figure 1B). However, we apply a more stringent field of view mask which was created using the intersection of sensitivity across multiple participants to all our data to exclude any voxels with a sensitivity less than around 10% of the maximum sensitivity (Figure 5C). This avoids including any voxels that might be less reliable due to inhomogeneous sensitivity.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Figure 1 supplement. Is it possible there may be some concern about the drop in signal on the right due to variability in the location of the CI transducer across participants? Is it possible the drop in signal in right middle/superior temporal and inferior frontal is also due to loss of measurement here across the group of CI users?</p></disp-quote><p>Thank you for raising this important point, which is something weâve worried about a lot. Although we cannot rule out the effects of lower sensitivity in the magnitude of the activation in certain areas, we were fairly confident that the ROIs we explored are not overlapping with low sensitivity areas.</p><p>To quantify the expected change in signal resulting from the CI hardware, in addition to our simulation of two levels of optode blocking (moderate case 4 sources and 4 detectors, and extreme case 6 sources and 6 detectors, now in Appendix 2 â figure 1), we added another simulation study (Figure 3âfigure supplements 1-3). Briefly, for each CI user, we calculated how many sources and detectors were affected by the hardware. We then excluded this number of sources/detectors from a control participant. We repeated this process 100 times with different random assignments of excluded channels to the control data to get a sense of what the time course would be for control data (but missing the same number of channels as our CI data). We found a small drop in auditory activation that was still significantly above what we observed in the CI listeners. We note that we cannot completely rule out the effects of CI hardware on signals in the right temporal and parietal regions; however, we do not think it can fully account for our findings in the right auditory cortex. (Because we only studied CI users with a right unilateral implant, regions in the left hemisphere are unaffected.)</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Specific comments:</p><p>1. Lines 56-57: Please clarify. Are you saying that listening to degraded input reduces the ability for certain other processing, for instance, performance on a second task that involves memory encoding? Or is it that memory encoding on the speech is limited, or both? It is not entirely clear from the text.</p></disp-quote><p>When speech is degraded, listeners have trouble remembering it. For example, in Ward et al. (2016) we played normal-hearing participants short stories that were either normal speech, or degraded (but intelligible) due to noise vocoding (16 or 20 channels). We asked participants to repeat back as much of the stories as they could, and found poorer memory for the degraded stories (despite an intelligibility test indicating the stories were intelligible). Perhaps even more compelling evidence comes from studies of word list memory, in which not only the degraded word, but <italic>subsequent</italic> words are remembered more poorly. Because the subsequent words are not degraded, it is difficult to come up with an acoustic explanation for the memory difficultyâthus pointing towards some shared cognitive resource needed to understand degraded speech, that is thus less available for memory encoding.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>2.

Is it possible there may be some people under 1 year of use? If so this may be difficult with respect to interpretation for those users, since their performance with the device may not be their best, i.e., they may still yet improve. This process of adaptation to the implant could easily involve different brain regions other than measured in this study, or a different weighting depending on adaptation.</p></disp-quote><p>We agreed the duration of use is important to consider. We only included CI users if they had at least 1 year of experience with their implant.

Similarly, does the range of unaided hearing in the CI group get to the level of some &quot;functional&quot; residual hearing, or does the skew go to higher thresholds?

Perhaps residual hearing could be added as a covariate to the analyses.</p><p>There may also be clues based on performance on the AzBio task.

Figure 1.

In interpreting this task, and the areas involved, we are relying on the fairly extensive multiple-demand literature tied to these regions, and the work of Fedorenko and colleagues showing thatâin single-subject applicationsâregions activated by this task dissociate from those activated by language tasks. But, also, we have tried to remain somewhat agnostic about the specific cognitive processes engaged. We have made some educated guesses based on the broader literature, but we agree that our own current data have to be understood in terms of what we actually tested.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>6.
