Functional metabolomics demonstrated that magnesium modulates fatty acid biosynthesis by increasing saturated fatty acid biosynthesis while decreasing unsaturated fatty acid production. Exogenous supplementation of unsaturated and saturated fatty acids increased and decreased bacterial susceptibility to antibiotics, respectively, confirming the role of fatty acids in antibiotic resistance. Functional lipidomics revealed that glycerophospholipid metabolism is the major metabolic pathway remodeled by magnesium, where phosphatidylethanolamine biosynthesis is reduced and phosphatidylglycerol production is increased. This process alters membrane composition, increasing membrane polarization, and decreasing permeability and fluidity, thereby reducing antibiotic uptake by <italic>V. alginolyticus</italic>.

Phenotypic resistance does not involve genetic mutations and is transient, allowing bacteria to resume normal growth. Biofilm and bacterial persisters are two phenotypic resistance types that have been extensively studied (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Brandis et al., 2023</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Corona and Martinez, 2013</xref>). Biofilms have complex structures, containing elements that impede antibiotic diffusion, sequestering and inhibiting their activity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Corona and Martinez, 2013</xref>). Biofilm-forming bacteria and persisters also have distinct metabolic states that significantly reduce their antibiotic susceptibility (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib56">Yan and Bassler, 2019</xref>). These two types of phenotypic resistance share the common feature in their retarded or even cease of growth in the presence of antibiotics (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Corona and Martinez, 2013</xref>). However, specific factors that promote phenotypic resistance and allow bacteria to proliferate in the presence of antibiotics remain poorly defined.</p><p>Metal ions have a diverse impact on the chemical, physical, and physiological processes of antibiotic resistance (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Booth et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib41">Poole, 2017</xref>). This includes genetic elements that confer resistance to metals and antibiotics (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib41">Poole, 2017</xref>) and metal cations that directly hinder (or enhance) the activity of specific antibiotic drugs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib63">Zhang et al., 2014</xref>). The metabolic environment can also impact the sensitivity of bacteria to antibiotics (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Jiang et al., 2023b</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Lee and Collins, 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">Peng et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Jiang et al., 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib65">Zhao et al., 2021</xref>). Light metal ions, such as magnesium, sodium, and potassium, can behave as cofactors for different enzymes and influence drug efficacy. Heavy metal ions, including Cu<sup>2+</sup> and Zn<sup>2+</sup>, confer resistance to antibiotics (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib60">Yazdankhah et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib64">Zhang et al., 2019</xref>). Recent reports suggest that sodium negatively regulates redox states to promote the antibiotic resistance of <italic>Vibrio alginolyticus</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib57">Yang et al., 2018</xref>), while actively growing <italic>Bacillus subtilis</italic> cope with ribosome-targeting antibiotics by modulating ion flux (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Lee et al., 2019</xref>). In Gram-negative bacteria, by contrast, zinc enhances antibiotic efficacy by potentiating carbapenem, fluoroquinolone, and β-lactam-mediated killing (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Isaei et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib63">Zhang et al., 2014</xref>). Magnesium influences bacterial structure, cell motility, enzyme function, cell signaling, and pathogenesis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib51">Wang et al., 2019</xref>). This mineral also modulates microbiota to harvest energy from the diet (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">García-Legorreta et al., 2020</xref>), allowing <italic>B. subtilis</italic> to cope with ribosome-targeting antibiotics by modulating ion flux (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Lee et al., 2019</xref>). However, the role of magnesium in promoting phenotypic resistance is less well understood.</p><p><italic>Vibrios</italic> inhabit seawater, estuaries, bays, and coastal waters, regions full of metal ions such as magnesium (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Kumarage et al., 2022</xref>). Magnesium is the second most dissolved element in seawater after sodium. At a salinity of 3.5% seawater, the magnesium concentration is about 54 mM (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib49">Tsunogai et al., 1968</xref>), and in deep seawater, can be as high as 2500 mM (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib52">Wang et al., 2024</xref>). <italic>Vibrio parahaemolyticus</italic> and <italic>V. alginolyticus</italic> are two representative <italic>Vibrio</italic> pathogens that infect humans and aquatic animals, resulting in illness and economic loss, respectively (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Grimes, 2020</xref>). (Fluoro)quinolones such as balofloxacin (BLFX) are used to treat <italic>Vibrio</italic> infection; however, resistance has emerged due to overuse (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib48">Suyamud et al., 2024</xref>). Indeed, (fluoro)quinolones are one of China’s two primary residual chemicals associated with aquaculture (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">Liu et al., 2017</xref>). <italic>Vibrio</italic> can develop quinolone resistance through mutations in the DNA gyrase gene or through plasmid-mediated mechanisms (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Dutta et al., 2021</xref>). Thus, the use of <italic>V. parahaemolyticus</italic> and <italic>V. alginolyticus</italic> as bacterial representatives, and BLFX as a quinolone-based antibacterial representative, can help define novel magnesium-dependent phenotypic resistance mechanisms of pathogenic <italic>Vibrio</italic> species.</p><p>The current study evaluated whether magnesium induces phenotypic resistance in <italic>Vibrio</italic> species and defined the molecular/genetic basis for this resistance. Genetic approaches, GC-MS analysis of metabolite and membrane remodeling upon antibiotic exposure, membrane physiology, and extensive antimicrobial susceptibility testing were used for the evaluations.</p></sec><sec id="s2" sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><sec id="s2-1"><title>Mg<sup>2+</sup> promotes phenotypic resistance to antibiotics</title><p>Marine environments and agriculture, where antibiotics are commonly used, are rich in magnesium. To investigate whether this mineral impacts antibiotic activity, the minimal inhibitory concentration (MIC) of <italic>V. alginolyticus</italic> ATCC33787 and <italic>V. parahaemolyticus</italic> VP01, which we referred to as ATCC33787 and VP01, isolated from marine aquaculture, to BLFX in Luria–Bertani medium (LB medium) plus 3% NaCl as LBS medium and ‘artificial seawater’ (ASWT) medium that included the major ion species in marine water (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib54">Wilson, 1975</xref>) (LB medium plus 210 mM NaCl, 35 mM Mg<sub>2</sub>SO<sub>4</sub>, 7 mM KCl, and 7 mM CaCl<sub>2</sub>) were assessed (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="supp1">Supplementary file 1a</xref>). The MICs of ATCC33787 to BLFX were 54 and 1 μg/mL in ASWT and LBS medium, respectively. Similarly, the MICs to VP01 were 25 and 3 μg/mL in ASWT and LBS medium, respectively (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1A</xref>). The role of exogenous NaCl in antibiotic resistance was investigated previously (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib57">Yang et al., 2018</xref>). The current study found that the MIC for BLFX was the same in LB and M9 minimal medium (M9 medium) plus 7 mM KCl or 7 mM CaCl<sub>2</sub> (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1</xref>). However, the MIC for BLFX was higher in ASWT medium supplemented with Mg<sub>2</sub>SO<sub>4</sub> or MgCl<sub>2</sub> than in LB medium (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1B</xref>). Mg<sub>2</sub>SO<sub>4</sub> or MgCl<sub>2</sub> had no difference on MIC, suggesting it is Mg<sup>2+</sup> not other ions contribute to the MIC change. The MIC for BLFX increased at higher concentrations of MgCl<sub>2</sub> in ASWT medium. Specifically, adding 50 mM or 200 mM MgCl<sub>2</sub> increased the MIC for BLFX by 200- or 1600-fold, respectively (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1C</xref>). At BLFX doses of 1.56, 3.125, 6.25, and 12.5 µg, the zone of inhibition decreased with increasing MgCl<sub>2</sub> (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1D</xref>). Exogenous MgCl<sub>2</sub> also increased the MICs for other quinolone (e.g., nalidixic acid, levofloxacin, ciprofloxacin, ofloxacin, and moxifloxacin) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1E</xref>) and non-quinolone antibiotics including antibacterial peptides (colistin), macrolides (roxithromycin), tetracyclines (oxytetraycline), β-lactams (ceftriaxone, ceftazidime), and aminoglycosides (amikacin, kanamycin, and gentamicin) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1F</xref>). Notably, magnesium had a reduced effect on ceftriaxone and gentamicin than other antibiotics. Importantly, exogenous MgCl<sub>2</sub> also increased MICs of clinic isolates, carbapenem-resistant <italic>Escherichia coli</italic>, carbapenem-resistant <italic>Klebsiella pneumoniae,</italic> carbapenem-resistant <italic>Pseudomonas aeruginosa,</italic> and carbapenem-resistant <italic>Acinetobacter baumannii</italic> to BLFX (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1G</xref>).

While Mg<sup>2+</sup> is a co-factor for enzymes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Garfinkel and Garfinkel, 1985</xref>), whether this mineral can promote antibiotic resistance independent of this function remains unknown.</p><p>To better understand how magnesium affects bacterial metabolism, <italic>V. alginolyticus</italic> was cultured in M9 medium in the presence of various amounts of MgCl<sub>2</sub> (0, 0.78, 3.125, 12.5, 50, or 200 mM) and the levels of 54 metabolites were assessed by GC-MS. Five biological and two technical replicates were evaluated for each treatment (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s1">Figure 2—figure supplement 1</xref>). The levels of 41 metabolites were differential (p&lt;0.05) and are presented as Z-values (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2A</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s2">Figure 2—figure supplement 2</xref>). Orthogonal partial least square discriminant analysis (OPLS-DA) was conducted that separated the six treatments into three groups: group 1 included 0, 0.78, and 3.125 mM MgCl<sub>2</sub>; group 2 was a singlet of 12.5 mM; and group 3 included 50 and 200 mM MgCl<sub>2</sub>. Component t[1] distinguishes group 1 from groups 2 and 3; component t[2] distinguishes group 3 from groups 1 and 2 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2B</xref>). Discriminating variables are shown as S-plot, where cut-off values are ≥0.05 absolute value of covariance p and 0.5 for correlation p(corr). Six biomarkers/metabolites were selected from component t[1] and p[1]. More specifically, the abundance of cadaverine, urea, palmitic acid, aminoethanol, and fumaric acid were increased, but pyroglutamic acid and glutamic acid were decreased (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2C</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s3">Figure 2—figure supplement 3</xref>). Pathway enrichment analysis suggests that 12 pathways are involved. Notably, one of the pathways is biosynthesis of unsaturated fatty acids (terminology in the software; actually, it is biosynthesis of fatty acids) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2D</xref>), where the abundance of palmitic acid and stearic acid were increased in an Mg<sup>2+</sup> dose-dependent manner (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2E</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s4">Figure 2—figure supplement 4</xref>). Moreover, palmitic acid was a crucial biomarker (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s4">Figure 2—figure supplement 4</xref>). The increase in fatty acid biosynthesis could be partially explained by an imbalanced pyruvate cycle/TCA cycle, in which fumarate levels increased at higher Mg<sup>2+</sup> while succinate levels increased at lower Mg<sup>2+</sup> (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s3">Figure 2—figure supplement 3B</xref>). These findings indicated that glycolysis fluxes into fatty acid biosynthesis rather than the pyruvate cycle/TCA cycle. The relevance of fatty acids and BLFX was demonstrated by the observation that exogenous palmitic acid increased bacterial resistance to BLFX (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2F</xref>). These results suggest that fatty acid metabolism may be critical to magnesium-based phenotypic resistance.</p><fig-group><fig id="fig2" position="float"><label>Figure 2.</label><caption><title>Mg<sup>2+</sup>-induced metabolomic change.</title><p>(<bold>A</bold>) Differential metabolomes in the absence or presence of the indicated concentrations of MgCl<sub>2</sub>.

Staining decreased with increasing MgCl<sub>2</sub>, indicating that bacterial membrane permeability declined in an Mg<sup>2+</sup> dose-dependent manner (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6E</xref>). These results indicate that exogenous Mg<sup>2+</sup> reduces bacterial membrane permeability.</p><p>Exogenous palmitic acid also shifted the fluorescence signal peaks to the left in an MgCl<sub>2</sub>-dependent manner while palmitic acid only slightly shifted the peaks (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6F</xref>). In contrast, exogenous linolenic acid shifted the peak to the right in a dose-dependent manner at 50 mM MgCl<sub>2</sub> (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6G</xref>). These results indicate that exogenous palmitic acid and linolenic acid decrease or increase membrane permeability, respectively. Membrane permeability was increased in Δ<italic>fadR</italic> cells than in WT cells and was reduced by Mg<sup>2+</sup>, remaining higher than the control (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6H</xref>). However, ∆<italic>arcA</italic> cells had lower membrane permeability at lower MgCl<sub>2</sub> concentrations (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6I</xref>).

The current study found that Mg<sup>2+</sup> had opposing effects on the abundance of saturated and unsaturated fatty acids, stimulating saturated fatty acid biosynthesis at moderately high levels, while inhibiting unsaturated fatty acids biosynthesis at ≥3 mM.

After incubated for 20 min at 30℃ at vibration without light, the sample was centrifuged for 10 min at 12,000 rpm. The pellets were resuspended with 20 μL of 3% NaCI. Aliquots of 2 μL sample were dropped on the agarose slide and photos taken under the inverted fluorescence microscope.</p></sec><sec id="s4-16"><title>Measurement of membrane permeability</title><p>Measurement of membrane permeability was carried out as described previously (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Chen et al., 2025</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib47">Su et al., 2021</xref>). ATCC33787 were cultured in medium with desired concentrations of MgCl<sub>2</sub>, collected, and then adjusted to OD 0.6. Aliquots of 100 μL bacteria cells of each sample were diluted to 1 mL and 2 μL 10 mg/mL SYT09 was added. After incubated for 15 min at 30℃ at vibration without light, the mixtures were filtered and measured by flow cytometry (BD FACSCalibur, USA).</p></sec></sec></body><back><sec sec-type="additional-information" id="s5"><title>Additional information</title><fn-group content-type="competing-interest"><title>Competing interests</title><fn fn-type="COI-statement" id="conf1"><p>No competing interests declared</p></fn></fn-group><fn-group content-type="author-contribution"><title>Author contributions</title><fn fn-type="con" id="con1"><p>Data curation, Formal analysis, Funding acquisition, Investigation, Writing – review and editing</p></fn><fn fn-type="con" id="con2"><p>Data curation, Formal analysis, Validation, Investigation, Methodology</p></fn><fn fn-type="con" id="con3"><p>Validation, Investigation</p></fn><fn fn-type="con" id="con4"><p>Formal analysis, Investigation</p></fn><fn fn-type="con" id="con5"><p>Validation, Investigation</p></fn><fn fn-type="con" id="con6"><p>Conceptualization, Formal analysis, Supervision, Funding acquisition, Writing – original draft, Project administration, Writing – review and editing</p></fn></fn-group></sec><sec sec-type="supplementary-material" id="s6"><title>Additional files</title><supplementary-material id="sdata1"><label>Source data 1.</label><caption><title>File containing original western blots in Appendix 1, indicating the relevant bands and treatments.</title></caption><media xlink:href="elife-100427-data1-v1.zip" mimetype="application" mime-subtype="zip"/></supplementary-material><supplementary-material id="sdata2"><label>Source data 2.</label><caption><title>Original files for western blot analysis displayed in Appendix 1.</title></caption><media xlink:href="elife-100427-data2-v1.zip" mimetype="application" mime-subtype="zip"/></supplementary-material><supplementary-material id="supp1"><label>Supplementary file 1.</label><caption><title>Gradients of medium and primers used in this study.</title><p>(a) Comparison in components in LBS and ASWT.

To investigate whether magnesium binds to BLFX, BLFX was preincubated with magnesium, and zone of inhibition (ZOI) analysis was conducted. Six different concentrations of BLFX were separately incubated with six different concentrations of MgCl<sub>2</sub>, and then spotted on filter paper so that a defined amount of BLFX could be used for ZOI. While lower concentrations of MgCl<sub>2</sub> (0.78, 3.125, or 12.5 mM) did not alter the ZOI, higher concentrations, including 50 and 200 mM MgCl<sub>2</sub>, decreased the ZOI (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="app1fig1">Appendix 1—figure 1A</xref>), suggesting that even high doses of magnesium had only a partial effect on BLFX through direct binding. For example, at 200 mM MgCl<sub>2</sub> and 5 or 10 μg/mL BLFX, the BLFX ZOI was 53.2 and 70.3% of the ZOI at 0 mM MgCl<sub>2</sub>, suggesting that ≥50% of the antibiotics were still functional.

The relationship between TolC, an efflux pump that transports quinolones from bacterial cells, and Mg<sup>2+</sup> was also assessed (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Kobylka et al., 2020</xref>). The expression of TolC/tolC was unaffected by Mg<sup>2+</sup> (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="app1fig1">Appendix 1—figure 1D</xref>). Magnesium is critical for LPS stability. LPS levels increased at 200 mM Mg<sup>2+</sup> (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="app1fig1">Appendix 1—figure 1E</xref>), however, the loss of waaF, lpxA, and lpxC, three key genes involved in LPS biosynthesis, did not influence BLFX sensitivity/resistance in the presence of Mg<sup>2+</sup> (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="app1fig1">Appendix 1—figure 1F</xref>).

In my view, the authors succeeded in their goals and present a compelling study that will have important implications for the antibiotic resistance research community. Since metals like magnesium are present in all lab media compositions and are present in the host, the data presented in this study certainly will inspire additional research by the community. These could include research into whether other types of metals also induce multi-drug resistance, whether this phenomenon can be observed in other bacterial species, especially pathogenic species that cause clinical disease, and whether the underlying molecular determinants (i.e. enzymes) of metal-induced phenotypic resistance could be new antimicrobial drug targets themselves.</p><p>Strengths:</p><p>This study's strengths include that the authors used a variety of methodologies, all of which point to a clear effect of exogenous Mg2+ on drug resistance in the targeted species. I also comment the authors for carrying out a comprehensive study, spanning evaluation of whole cell phenotypes, metabolic pathways, genetic manipulation, to enzyme activity level evaluation.

Biofilm and bacterial persisters are two phenotypic resistance types that have been extensively studied (Brandis et al., 2023; Corona &amp; Martinez, 2013). Biofilms have complex structures, containing elements that impede antibiotic diffusion, sequestering and inhibiting their activity (Ciofu et al., 2022). Biofilm-forming bacteria and persisters also have distinct metabolic states that significantly reduce their antibiotic susceptibility (Yan &amp; Bassler, 2019).

This includes genetic elements that confer resistance to metals and antibiotics (Poole, 2017) and metal cations that directly hinder (or enhance) the activity of specific antibiotic drugs (Zhang et al., 2014). The metabolic environment can also impact the sensitivity of bacteria to antibiotics (Jiang et al., 2023; Lee &amp; Collins, 2012; Peng et al., 2015; Zhang et al., 2020; Zhao et al., 2021). Light metal ions, such as magnesium, sodium, and potassium, can behave as cofactors for different enzymes (Du et al., 2016) and influence drug efficacy. Heavy metal ions, including Cu2+ and Zn2+, confer resistance to antibiotics (Yazdankhah et al., 2014; Zhang et al., 2018). Recent reports suggest that sodium negatively regulates redox states to promote the antibiotic resistance of Vibrio alginolyticus (Yang et al., 2018), while actively growing <italic>Bacillus subtilis</italic> cope with ribosome-targeting antibiotics by modulating ion flux (Lee et al, 2019). In Gram-negative bacteria, by contrast, zinc enhances antibiotic efficacy by potentiating carbapenem, fluoroquinolone, and β-lactam-mediated killing (Isaei et al., 2016; Zhang et al., 2014).

In my view, the authors succeeded in their goals and presented a compelling study that will have important implications for the antibiotic resistance research community. Since metals like magnesium are present in all lab media compositions and are present in the host, the data presented in this study certainly will inspire additional research by the community. These could include research into whether other types of metals also induce multi-drug resistance, whether this phenomenon can be observed in other bacterial species, especially pathogenic species that cause clinical disease, and whether the underlying molecular determinants (i.e. enzymes) of metal-induced phenotypic resistance could be new antimicrobial drug targets themselves.</p><p>Strengths:</p><p>This study's strengths include that the authors used a variety of methodologies, all of which point to a clear effect of exogenous Mg2+ on drug resistance in the targeted species. I also commend the authors for carrying out a comprehensive study, spanning evaluation of whole cell phenotypes, metabolic pathways, genetic manipulation, to enzyme activity level evaluation. The fact that the authors uncovered a molecular mechanism underlying Mg2+-induced phenotypic resistance is particularly important as the key proteins should be studied further.</p><p>Weaknesses:</p><p>I believe there are weaknesses in the manuscript, however. The authors take for granted that the reader is familiar with all the assays utilized, and do not properly explain some experiments, and thus I highly suggest that the authors add a brief statement in each situation describing the rationale for each selected methodology (more details are in the private review to the authors). The Results section is also quite long and bogs down at times, and I suggest that the authors reduce its length by 10 to 20%. In contrast, the Introduction is sparse and lacks key aspects, for example, there should be mention of the study's main purpose and approaches, plus an introduction to the authors' choice of species and their known drug resistance properties, as well as the drug of choice (balofloxacin). Another notable weakness is that the authors evaluated Mg2+-induced phenotypic resistance only against two closely related species, and thus the generalizability of this mechanism of drug resistance is not known. The paper would be strengthened if the authors could demonstrate this type of phenotypic resistance in at least one more Gram-negative species and at least one Gram-positive species (antimicrobial susceptibility evaluations would suffice), each of which should be pathogenic to humans. Demonstrating magnesium-induced phenotypic drug resistance in the WHO Priority Bacterial Pathogens would be particularly important.</p><p>In general, the conclusions drawn by the authors are justified by the data, except for the interpretation of some experiments. Importantly, this paper has discovered new antimicrobial resistance mechanisms and has also pointed to potential new targets for antimicrobials.</p></disp-quote><p>Thank you so much for your suggestion!

The figure 2 is now removed to Suppl. Fig 2, and the description of figure 2 is moved to Suppl. Text. We revise the description of the result as following, which is in Suppl. Text:</p><p>“Prior studies suggest that the chelation of antibiotics by magnesium ions inhibits antibiotic uptake (Deitchman et al., 2018; Lunestad and Goksøyr, 1990). To investigate whether magnesium binds to balofloxacin, balofloxacin was pre-incubated with magnesium, and zone of inhibition (ZOI) analysis was conducted. Six different concentrations of balofloxacin were separately incubated with six different concentrations of MgCl2, and then spotted on filter paper so that a defined amount of balofloxacin could be used for ZOI. While lower concentrations of MgCl2, (0.78, 3.125, or 12.5 mM) did not alter the ZOI, higher concentrations, including 50 and 200 mM MgCl2, decreased the ZOI (Suppl. Fig 2A), suggesting that even high doses of magnesium had only a partial effect on balofloxacin through direct binding. For example, at 200 mM MgCl2 and 5 or 10 μg/mL balofloxacin, the balofloxacin ZOI was 53.2 and 70.3% of the ZOI at 0 mM MgCl2, suggesting that ≥50% of the antibiotics were still functional.

Fig 2B), while exogenous Mg2+ increased intracellular Mg2+ levels in a dose-dependent manner. For example, exogenous 50 and 200 mM MgCl2 increased intracellular Mg2+ levels to 1.21 and 1.31 mM, respectively (Suppl. Fig 2C). The relationship between TolC, an efflux pump that transports quinolones from bacterial cells, and Mg2+ was also assessed (Kobylka <italic>et al.</italic>, 2020; Song <italic>et al.</italic>, 2020). The expression of TolC/<italic>tolC</italic> was unaffected by Mg2+ (Suppl. Fig 2D). Magnesium is critical for LPS stability. LPS levels increased at 200 mM Mg2+ (Suppl. Fig 2E), however, the loss of <italic>waaF, lpxA</italic>, and <italic>lpxC</italic>, three key genes involved in LPS biosynthesis, did not influence balofloxacin sensitivity/resistance in the presence of Mg2+ (Suppl. Fig 2F). These findings suggest that magnesium-induced LPS biosynthesis does not contribute directly to BLFX resistance and demonstrate that Mg2+ influx is involved in balofloxacin resistance.”</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>(6) For the metabolomics results, it will help immensely if the authors provide a volcano plot of the identified metabolites and plot the heat map according to the -log2 metabolite intensities. In Figure 3A, it's not clear what information is conveyed through Euclidean distance calculations of the heat map. In Figure 3 B, the authors mentioned that the OPLS-DA test was conducted, although the figure shows a PCA plot, so it's not clear how these two are connected. Figure 3 E: the figure legend says scattered plot, but the panel represents color-coded numerical values, not a scattered plot. Also, it's not clear how they got those values.</p></disp-quote><p>We appreciate this comment! We quite agree with you that if the differential metabolites could be shown as volcano plot. However, we didn’t adopt volcano plot in this study because this is a magnesium concentration-dependent metabolomes that includes 6 groups in parallel. Volcano plots may give a complex view of the comparison among different groups. We also tried to plot the heat map according to the -log2 metabolite intensities. Although this analysis cluster 200 mM and 50 mM groups better, the data of low magnesium concentrations was not consistent, which may be due to the minor metabolic change of low concentrations magnesium.

As well, the end of the Introduction section ends abruptly with no transition to the present study itself. The end of the introduction should include one or two sentences introducing the main purpose of the study, its approach, and the techniques undertaken. For example, &quot;In this study, we evaluated whether magnesium induces phenotypic resistance in Vibrio species and the molecular/genetic basis for such resistance.

These have been rewritten following as “To investigate whether magnesium binds to balofloxacin, balofloxacin was preincubated with magnesium, and zone of inhibition (ZOI) analysis was conducted. Six different concentrations of balofloxacin were separately incubated with six different concentrations of MgCl2, and then spotted on filter paper so that a defined amount of balofloxacin could be used for ZOI. While lower concentrations of MgCl2, (0.78, 3.125, or 12.5 mM) did not alter the ZOI, higher concentrations, including 50 and 200 mM MgCl2, decreased the ZOI (Suppl. Fig 2A), suggesting that even high doses of magnesium had only a partial effect on balofloxacin through direct binding. For example, at 200 mM MgCl2 and 5 or 10 μg/mL balofloxacin, the balofloxacin ZOI was 53.2 and 70.3% of the ZOI at 0 mM MgCl2, suggesting that ≥50% of the antibiotics were still functional.

For example, exogenous 50 and 200 mM MgCl2 increased intracellular Mg2+ levels to 1.21 and 1.31 mM, respectively (Suppl. Fig 2C). The relationship between TolC, an efflux pump that transports quinolones from bacterial cells, and Mg2+ was also assessed (Kobylka <italic>et al.</italic>, 2020; Song <italic>et al.</italic>, 2020).

I advise the authors to move the details in lines 166-169 to the Materials and Methods and replace this section instead with a more accessible description of the statistical analysis that a non-expert would be able to appreciate. Furthermore, analysis of Figure 3A indicates that the levels of asparagine, 4-hydroxybutyric acid, uracil, cystathionine, fumaric acid, and aminoethanol have significantly changed at high MgCl2, but these are not mentioned in the text.

The relevance of fatty acids and BLFX was demonstrated by the observation that exogenous palmitic acid increased bacterial resistance to balofloxacin (Fig 2F).

Aliquot of 100 μL bacteria cells of each sample were diluted to 1 mL and 10 μL (10 mg/mL) FM5-95 (Thermo Fisher Scientific, USA) was added. FM5-95 is a lipophilic styryl dye that insert into the outer leaflet of bacterial membrane and become fluorescence. This dye preferentially bind to the microdomains with high membrane fluidity(Wen et al., 2022).
