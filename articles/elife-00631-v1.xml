compared protein evolution to the game where one word is converted into another a single letter at a time, with the constraint that all intermediates are words: WORD→WORE→GORE→GONE→GENE. In this analogy, epistasis constrains evolution, with some mutations tolerated only after the occurrence of others. To test whether epistasis similarly constrains actual protein evolution, we created all intermediates along a 39-mutation evolutionary trajectory of influenza nucleoprotein, and also introduced each mutation individually into the parent. Several mutations were deleterious to the parent despite becoming fixed during evolution without negative impact. These mutations were destabilizing, and were preceded or accompanied by stabilizing mutations that alleviated their adverse effects. The constrained mutations occurred at sites enriched in T-cell epitopes, suggesting they promote viral immune escape. Our results paint a coherent portrait of epistasis during nucleoprotein evolution, with stabilizing mutations permitting otherwise inaccessible destabilizing mutations which are sometimes of adaptive value.</p><p><bold>DOI:</bold> <ext-link ext-link-type="doi" xlink:href="10.7554/eLife.00631.001">http://dx.doi.org/10.7554/eLife.00631.001</ext-link></p></abstract><abstract abstract-type="executive-summary"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.00631.002</object-id><title>eLife digest</title><p>During evolution, the effect of one mutation on a protein can depend on whether another mutation is also present. This phenomenon is similar to the game in which one word is converted to another word, one letter at a time, subject to the rule that all the intermediate steps are also valid words: for example, the word WORD can be converted to the word GENE as follows: WORD→WORE→GORE→GONE→GENE. In this example, the D must be changed to an E before the W is changed to a G, because GORD is not a valid word.</p><p>Similarly, during the evolution of a virus, a mutation that helps the virus evade the human immune system might only be tolerated if the virus has acquired another mutation beforehand. This type of mutational interaction would constrain the evolution of the virus, since its capacity to take advantage of the second mutation depends on the first mutation having already occurred.</p><p>Gong et al. examined whether such interactions have indeed constrained evolution of the influenza virus. Between 1968 and 2007, the nucleoprotein—which acts as a scaffold for the replication of genetic material—in the human H3N2 influenza virus underwent a series of 39 mutations. To test whether all of these mutations could have been tolerated by the 1968 virus, Gong et al. introduced each one individually into the 1968 nucleoprotein. They found that several mutations greatly reduced the fitness of the 1968 virus when introduced on their own, which strongly suggests that these ‘constrained mutations’ became part of the virus’s genetic makeup as a result of interactions with ‘enabling’ mutations.</p><p>The constrained mutations decreased the stability of the nucleoprotein at high temperatures, while the enabling mutations counteracted this effect. It may, therefore, be possible to identify enabling mutations based on their effects on thermal stability. Intriguingly, the constrained mutations helped the virus overcome one form of human immunity to influenza, suggesting that interactions between mutations might limit the rate at which viruses evolve to evade the immune system.</p><p>Overall, these results show that interactions among mutations constrain the evolution of the influenza nucleoprotein in a fashion that can be largely understood in terms of protein stability. If the same is true for other proteins and viruses, this work could lead to a deeper understanding of the constraints that govern evolution at the molecular level.</p><p><bold>DOI:</bold> <ext-link ext-link-type="doi" xlink:href="10.7554/eLife.00631.002">http://dx.doi.org/10.7554/eLife.00631.002</ext-link></p></abstract><kwd-group kwd-group-type="author-keywords"><title>Author keywords</title><kwd>epistasis</kwd><kwd>protein evolution</kwd><kwd>influenza</kwd><kwd>protein stability</kwd></kwd-group><kwd-group kwd-group-type="research-organism"><title>Research organism</title><kwd>Virus</kwd></kwd-group><funding-group><award-group id="par-1"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution>National Institutes of Health</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>1 R01 GM102198-01</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Gong</surname><given-names>Lizhi Ian</given-names></name><name><surname>Bloom</surname><given-names>Jesse D</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="par-2"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution>National Institutes of Health</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>1 R01 GM086887-05</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Suchard</surname><given-names>Marc A</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><funding-statement>The funders had no role in study design, data collection and interpretation, or the decision to submit the work for publication.</funding-statement></funding-group><custom-meta-group><custom-meta specific-use="meta-only"><meta-name>Author impact statement</meta-name><meta-value>Some of the mutations that occur during influenza evolution can only be tolerated in conjunction with other mutations that increase the stability of a viral protein.</meta-value></custom-meta></custom-meta-group></article-meta></front><body><sec id="s1" sec-type="intro"><title>Introduction</title><p>Epistasis can play a key role in evolution, such as by constraining accessible evolutionary pathways (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib52">Weinreich et al., 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Kryazhimskiy et al., 2011</xref>) and increasing the role of contingency in adaptation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Blount et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Bridgham et al., 2009</xref>). One of the simplest types of epistasis is that which occurs between mutations within a single protein. That such epistasis is common has long been considered self-evident–for example, in their seminal 1965 analysis of protein evolution, Emile Zuckerkandl and Linus Pauling wrote, “Of course … the functional effect of a given single substitution will frequently depend on the presence or absence of a number of other substitutions (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib55">Zuckerkandl and Pauling, 1965</xref>).” But although numerous laboratory evolution and site-directed mutagenesis experiments have demonstrated that mutations can in principle exhibit strong epistatic interactions (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Bershtein et al., 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Bloom et al., 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Lunzer et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib41">Salverda et al., 2011</xref>), surprisingly little is known about the actual role of epistasis in natural protein evolution. A few studies have reconstructed naturally occurring mutations involved in antibiotic resistance or steroid-receptor ligand specificity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib50">Wang et al., 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib51">Weinreich et al., 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">Ortlund et al., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Bridgham et al., 2009</xref>) and found strong epistatic interactions. However, these studies have focused on small numbers of mutations pre-selected for analysis due to their putative adaptive role, and in most cases the actual temporal order of mutations is unknown.</p><p>As a result, many basic questions remain without clear answers: What is the prevalence of epistasis during protein evolution? How does epistasis arise from an evolutionary process that is conceived as proceeding through the incremental accumulation of mutations? And is it possible to coherently understand epistasis in terms of the underlying protein biophysics?</p><p>An experimental approach to address these questions is suggested by John Maynard Smith’s classic analogy between protein evolution and the game where the goal is to convert one word into another a single letter at a time passing only through intermediates that are also words (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Maynard Smith, 1970</xref>):<disp-formula id="eqn1"><mml:math id="m1"><mml:mrow><mml:mtext>WORD</mml:mtext><mml:mo>→</mml:mo><mml:mtext>WORE</mml:mtext><mml:mo>→</mml:mo><mml:mtext>GORE</mml:mtext><mml:mo>→</mml:mo><mml:mtext>GONE</mml:mtext><mml:mo>→</mml:mo><mml:mtext>GENE</mml:mtext><mml:mo>.</mml:mo></mml:mrow></mml:math></disp-formula></p><p>Implicit in this analogy is the idea that epistasis constrains evolution—for example, the original parent sequence does not tolerate three of the four eventual changes, as GORD, WERD and WOND are not words. We sought to similarly test for epistasis in actual protein evolution by reconstructing an extended natural evolutionary trajectory, and then also introducing each mutation individually into the original parent (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1</xref>). While this experimental strategy is not guaranteed to find every possible epistatic interaction, it will systematically identify all mutations that have different effects in the original parent and the evolutionary intermediates in which they actually occurred. The experimental strategy in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1</xref> also offers the possibility of determining how epistatically interacting mutations were actually fixed—for example through sequential functional intermediates as posited by Maynard Smith, or by the simultaneous or closely coupled fixation of several individually deleterious mutations (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Kimura, 1985</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Meer et al., 2010</xref>).<fig id="fig1" position="float"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.00631.003</object-id><label>Figure 1.</label><caption><title>Outline of experiment designed to parallel Maynard Smith’s analogy.</title><p>The actual evolutionary trajectory involves the accumulation of mutations, and consists of a series of evolutionary intermediates. We recreate and experimentally assay each of these evolutionary intermediates. We also introduce each mutation individually into the original parent sequence, and experimentally assay these single mutants. If Maynard Smith is correct, each of the naturally occurring evolutionary intermediates should be a functional protein. However, some of the single mutants could exhibit impaired function if there is significant epistasis among mutations along the evolutionary trajectory.</p><p><bold>DOI:</bold> <ext-link ext-link-type="doi" xlink:href="10.7554/eLife.00631.003">http://dx.doi.org/10.7554/eLife.00631.003</ext-link></p></caption><graphic xlink:href="elife-00631-fig1-v1.tif"/></fig></p><p>The experiment outlined in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1</xref> requires a protein for which it is possible both to reconstruct the natural evolution and to assay for the functions that contribute to biological fitness. Human H3N2 influenza A virus is exceptionally suited to the first requirement, as the extensive availability of contemporary and historical sequences enables the detailed reconstruction of evolutionary trajectories. We focused on the 498-residue nucleoprotein (NP). Although NP’s evolution is less rapid and medically infamous than that of its surface counterparts hemagglutinin and neuraminidase, NP still accumulates roughly one amino-acid substitution per year (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">Rambaut et al., 2008</xref>). Crucially for our experiment, NP’s primary function—serving as a scaffold for viral RNA during transcription and genome packaging (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">Portela and Digard, 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib54">Ye et al., 2006</xref>)—occurs within the interior of infected cells, and so is probably fairly authentically represented in tissue-culture assays.</p><p>NP is also a target of cytotoxic T lymphocytes (CTLs), and so is under continual pressure for change in CTL epitopes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Berkhoff et al., 2004</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib46">Valkenburg et al., 2011</xref>)—a pressure partially countered by the fact that some of these epitopes are under functional constraint (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">Rimmelzwaan, et al., 2004a</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Berkhoff et al., 2005</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">2006</xref>). CTL selection in influenza is thought to be weaker than antibody selection on the viral surface proteins, and so much of NP’s evolution is shaped by stochastic forces such as population bottlenecks and hitchhiking with antigenic mutations in the surface proteins (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">Rambaut et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Bhatt et al., 2011</xref>)—stochastic forces that in some cases can also accelerate the fixation CTL escape mutations (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Gog et al., 2003</xref>). Our experiments do not measure these complexities of immune pressure as they do not include CTL selection, but as described later in this paper, existing data enable us to identify adaptive CTL-escape mutations.</p><p>In the work reported here, we use the strategy in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1</xref> to synthesize information about influenza’s natural evolution with our own experiments to examine epistasis in NP evolution. We find that epistasis constrains both the sequence evolution and ongoing adaptation of NP, and that the mechanistic basis for most of this epistasis can be understood in remarkably simple terms.</p></sec><sec id="s2" sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><sec id="s2-1"><title>Several mutations are under strong epistatic constraint</title><p>We focused on the evolutionary trajectory separating NPs from two human H3N2 strains isolated 39 years apart, A/Aichi/2/1968 and A/Brisbane/10/2007 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2</xref>). To map this trajectory, we developed a probabilistic technique to estimate the posterior distribution of mutational events (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">Minin and Suchard, 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">O’Brien et al., 2009</xref>) and, original to this work, their time-orderings along an unknown phylogenetic tree within the BEAST software package (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Drummond et al., 2012</xref>). Each sample from this posterior distribution represents a mutational path from Aichi/1968 to Brisbane/2007, which in turn can be represented as a directed graph through protein sequence space (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s1">Figure 2—figure supplement 1</xref>). Summarizing these graph samples effectively integrates over uncertainty in the tree and substitution process, and yields the marginal posterior distribution of the evolutionary trajectory from Aichi/1968 to Brisbane/2007 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2</xref>). The most probable trajectory consists of 39 mutational steps at 33 sites (5 mutations revert; 1 site mutates to two identities). The fact that NP sequences are available for every year since 1968 allows us to reconstruct the trajectory with remarkable precision: there are &gt;10<sup>46</sup> possible orderings of 39 mutations, yet we can confidently identify the sequences of 25 of the evolutionary intermediates; the remainder fall along regions of the trajectory where two or more mutations occurred in an unknown order (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2</xref>).<fig-group><fig id="fig2" position="float"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.00631.004</object-id><label>Figure 2.</label><caption><title>Inferred evolutionary trajectory.</title><p>(<bold>A</bold>) Evolutionary trajectory through protein sequence space from Aichi/1968 to Brisbane/2007 NP.

The second is some effect specific to E375G that is apparent in growth but not transcriptional activity. E375G (which causes loss of a negative charge) counterbalances the loss of a positive charge due to R384G. The image shows an electrostatic surface (PyMol, PDB 2IQH). R384 and E375 are on the same surface, contributing positive and negative charges. Mutating both to neutral glycine maintains the net charge.

The parent Aichi/1968 is only marginally more stable than the minimal threshold where activity and viral growth begin to suffer. For this reason, the three destabilizing mutations L259S, R384G, and V280A are highly deleterious to Aichi/1968. During NP’s evolution, stability fluctuates as the protein fixes stabilizing and destabilizing mutations. Each of the three destabilizing mutations that we identified as being under epistatic constraint is closely associated with a stabilizing mutation. The stabilizing M136I preceded the destabilizing V280A, and provided a stability cushion to eliminate V280A’s otherwise deleterious effect (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4 fig7">Figures 4C, 7C</xref>). The stabilizing S259L preceded the destabilizing R384G, and was necessary (in conjunction with E375G) to alleviate R384G’s otherwise deleterious effect (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4 fig7">Figures 4B, 7C</xref>). The stabilizing N334H occurred in close temporal proximity to the destabilizing L259S and fully counteracts L259S’s otherwise deleterious effect (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4 fig7">Figures 4B, 7C</xref>)—although in this case there is insufficient natural sequence data to determine which of these mutations occurred first (it is also possible that they occurred simultaneously).</p></sec><sec id="s2-4"><title>The epistatically constrained mutations contribute to viral immune escape</title><p>The aforementioned results illuminate the evolutionary steps that gave rise to the fixation of the individually deleterious destabilizing mutations, but they do not provide any indication of what forces may have driven this fixation. The destabilizing mutations could have been fixed stochastically by genetic drift or hitchhiking, or they could have been directly favored by selection for viral immune escape. As discussed in the Introduction, NP is a target of CTLs, and mutations in CTL epitopes benefit influenza by helping it evade immune memory that accumulates in the human population (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Berkhoff et al., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib46">Valkenburg et al., 2011</xref>).</p><p>We began by searching the literature for experimentally validated human CTL epitopes in NP.

The first approach has the advantage of only identifying experimentally validated epitopes, but the disadvantage that this set of epitopes is subject to unknown biases due to experimental choices about HLA types and viral strains. Computational prediction has the advantage of being unbiased with respect to HLA types and viral strains, but the disadvantage that the predictions may not be accurate.</p><p>As it turns out, both approaches give the same result—the three epistatically constrained mutations are significantly enriched in CTL epitopes relative to all sites in NP and to the set of sites that experienced substitutions along the evolutionary trajectory (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8">Figure 8</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8s2">Figure 8—figure supplement 2</xref>). These three destabilizing mutations are thus disproportionately important for viral immune escape, and may have been favored by selection for this property (a dN/dS test [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">Murrell et al., 2013</xref>] is inconclusive, probably due to lack of sequence data; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8s3">Figure 8—figure supplement 3</xref> and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD8-data">Figure 8—source code 2</xref>). Stability-mediated epistasis therefore constrains the adaptive process of CTL escape as well as the sequence evolution of NP. The destabilizing CTL-escape mutations L259S, R384G, and V280A were inaccessible to NP during much of its evolutionary trajectory, but were fixed after stabilizing mutations made the protein permissive to their occurrence.<fig-group><fig id="fig8" position="float"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.00631.031</object-id><label>Figure 8.</label><caption><title>The three epistatically constrained destabilizing mutations occur at sites significantly enriched in human CTL epitopes.</title><p>Distributions of the numbers of experimentally characterized epitopes per residue for all sites or sites that experienced mutations along the evolutionary trajectory are in blue and red, respectively.

We identified three mutations that are strongly deleterious to the original parent, yet were eventually fixed without adverse effect. All three mutations decrease NP’s thermal stability. This decreased stability reduces in vivo protein levels, in turn reducing total transcriptional activity and viral growth. On the other hand, stabilizing mutations have little effect on protein levels, activity, or growth in the background of the parent NP—presumably because this parent is already sufficiently stable for its cellular environment. However, these stabilizing mutations play a crucial evolutionary role by counteracting the destabilizing mutations and enabling them to fix during evolution.</p><p>Of course, we do not wish to caricature protein evolution by suggesting that all epistasis is mediated by stability. In principle, mutations can affect a multitude of properties of NP, including its homo-oligomerization, association with RNA and other proteins, and cellular transport. We do not suggest that these properties are unimportant. In fact, we observe an epistatic interaction between R384G and E375G that likely relates to the electrostatic charge on one of NP’s surfaces. Our assays are also of finite sensitivity, and so may miss small effects that are still significant to natural selection. There is also the potential for epistasis between NP and other viral proteins, although we see no evidence for such epistasis here, since all NP evolutionary intermediates that we tested are functional in a fixed background of other proteins. But doubtless some of these other mechanisms of epistasis would become apparent if we examined even longer evolutionary trajectories. However, the overriding message from our experiments is that stability-mediated epistasis is the dominant constraint on NP evolution.</p><p>Epistatically interacting mutations can be fixed in several ways. The mutations can accumulate sequentially without ever passing through a low-fitness intermediate (as in Maynard Smith’s analogy), an initial deleterious mutation can be compensated by a subsequent mutation, or multiple mutations can occur simultaneously. We have identified two instances that clearly conform to Maynard Smith’s paradigm: the stabilizing M136I preceded V280A, and the stabilizing S259L preceded R384G (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4B,C</xref>). We also identified two instances where the actual evolutionary path is unclear due to a lack of natural sequence data from the relevant timeframe: N334H/L259S, and E375G/R384G (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4A,B</xref>). However, in both cases it is at least possible that evolution conformed to Maynard Smith’s paradigm: no simultaneous mutations or deleterious intermediates need have occurred if N334H preceded L259S, and if E375G preceded R384G (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4A,B</xref>).</p><p>Previous experimental studies have identified stabilizing mutations as contributing to the evolution of enzyme specificities (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Bloom et al., 2006</xref>), bacterial (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib50">Wang et al., 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Bershtein et al., 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib51">Weinreich et al., 2006</xref>) and viral (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Chang and Torbett, 2011</xref>) drug resistance, and H5N1 transmissibility (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Imai et al., 2012</xref>). At a broader level, analyses of large datasets have shown that it is common for mutations to be deleterious to one protein homolog but benign to another (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Kondrashov et al., 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Baresic et al., 2010</xref>). Our work illustrates how the dynamics of stability during evolution might explain these findings. As shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7C</xref>, most of the intermediates during NP’s evolution are only marginally more stable than the minimal threshold where function begins to suffer. This marginal stability of natural proteins has been noted previously, and been given two distinct explanations. The first explanation holds that evolution actively selects for marginal stability because both insufficient and excess stability are deleterious (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">DePristo et al., 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib45">Tokuriki and Tawfik, 2009</xref>). The second explanation holds that evolution only selects against insufficient stability, but that proteins typically are marginally stable because most mutations are destabilizing and so extra stability is rapidly eroded by functionally neutral but destabilizing mutations (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib44">Taverna and Goldstein, 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Bloom et al., 2007</xref>). Our results decisively favor the second explanation for NP, since the evolving protein is usually marginally stable despite the fact that higher stability has no deleterious effect (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7A,B</xref>). We therefore suggest the following: functionally neutral but stabilizing mutations occasionally fix by stochastic forces such as genetic drift, population bottlenecks, or hitchhiking. These stabilizing mutations enable NP to tolerate otherwise deleterious destabilizing mutations. Although these destabilizing mutations could in principle also fix by stochastic forces, the three that we have identified are actually adaptive since they contribute to viral immune escape. Stability-mediated epistasis therefore constrains NP’s adaptation as well as its sequence evolution, since the accessibility of immune-escape mutations is dependent on the acquisition of enabling mutations.</p><p>It is intriguing to speculate whether similar forms of epistasis might constrain the evolution of other proteins. For example, the antigenic evolution of influenza hemagglutinin is punctuated, with a fairly constant rate of sequence change nonetheless leading to periodic jumps in antigenicity that require reformulation of the annual influenza vaccine (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib42">Smith et al., 2004</xref>). One explanation that has been posited for this punctuated pattern is that adaptive antigenic change is limited not by the overall rate of substitution, but rather by the waiting time for the protein to accumulate antigenically neutral mutations that can be productively combined with mutations causing large antigenic changes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Koelle et al., 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib47">van Nimwegen, 2006</xref>). Stability-mediated epistasis of the type that we have observed for NP provides at least one plausible mechanistic explanation for this and other cases of constrained molecular evolution.</p></sec><sec id="s4" sec-type="materials|methods"><title>Materials and methods</title><sec id="s4-1"><title>Evolutionary trajectory</title><p>Via Markov chain Monte Carlo implemented in BEAST (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Drummond et al., 2012</xref>), we estimated the joint posterior distribution of phylogenetic trees and mutations along the branches of these trees given 431 date-stamped human H3N2 NP protein sequences from the Influenza Virus Resource.

Your article has been favorably evaluated by a Senior editor and 3 reviewers, one of whom is a member of our Board of Reviewing Editors. The following individuals responsible for the peer review of your submission want to reveal their identity: Mercedes Pascual (Reviewing editor) and Fyodor Kondrashov (peer reviewer). The Reviewing editor and the other reviewers discussed their reviews before we reached this decision, and the Reviewing editor has prepared the follow comments to help you prepare a revised submission.</p><p>This work combines computational and experimental methods to demonstrate stability-mediated epistasis in the evolutionary trajectory of the influenza virus. It provides the first experimental exploration of fitness landscapes in actual evolutionary trajectories in sequence space.</p><p>The authors experimentally dissect the substitutions that have accrued in a naturally evolving influenza protein to argue that most of epistasis among sites is mediated by stability, and that stabilizing mutations are often pre-requisites for adaptive substitutions, which would otherwise be too destabilizing for a protein to accommodate. Although the referees felt that this was an ambitious and remarkable study in many ways, they also had a number of comments, summarized below, meant to strengthen the evidence and provide additional connections to existing literature and theory.</p><p>1) The Introduction and Discussion are written both from the perspective of protein evolution in general terms and evolution of NP in particular. For readers not already familiar with the background on the subject, it would be useful to better place the study in the context of previous work, so that its novelty can be more clearly conveyed. In particular, the authors rely on the concept of substitutions occurring one after another, as envisioned by Maynard Smith. This is well suited for exploring the concept of epistasis but does not capture all possibilities. Specifically, an alternative to sequential fixation of substitutions, compensatory substitutions (including instances when two individually deleterious substitutions are neutral when combined), being fixed at the same time, has been proposed by Kimura (1985, J. Genet 64: 7-19), with some evidence of this particular route of compensatory evolution found in tRNAs (Meer, 2010 Nature 464:279-82). In the authors’ data, two out of the three individual substitutions appear to have been fixed by Kimura’s model rather than Maynard Smith’s. Kimura’s model should be mentioned in the Introduction and also in the part that interprets the evolutionary mechanism at work in the fixation of L259S and R384G. To our knowledge, epistasis of the Kimura type has never been described for proteins, which would make this study even more exciting.</p><p>Also, the issue of structural stability as being an important factor in compensatory interactions has been discussed before (see Kondrashov AS, Sunyaev S, Kondrashov FA. Dobzhansky-Muller incompatibilities in protein evolution. Proc Natl Acad Sci U S A. 2002 Nov 12;99(23):14878-83; DePristo MA, Weinreich DM, Hartl DL.

Slow protein evolutionary rates are dictated by surface-core association. Proc Natl Acad Sci U S A. 2011 Jul 5;108(27):11151-6).</p><p>2) The study is described as dissecting, within the noise limits of the assays, the full extent of epistasis along the evolutionary trajectory of NP. However, the authors assay each of 39 individual mutational effects in the context of the <italic>ancestor</italic> strain alone, as well as the specific mutations that help to alleviate three apparently deleterious mutations. Thus, there may be much more epistasis that has been important to the specific evolutionary trajectory that NP has taken than the authors have been able to assay, because the authors reconstruct mutations in the ancestral strain alone. Although we recognize the extent of the experimental work, there seems to be no good reason to distinguish the ancestral strain and look only for epistasis relative to mutational effects on that background. Consideration of a small (5?) additional number of reconstructed mutations in different backgrounds would strengthen the evidence for the authors’ conclusions, if none of these were to prove as destabilizing as the three that are at the center of the argument. We recognize that this additional work may take a considerable time and recommend that the authors consider this extension only if it can be pursued within a relatively short time. Alternatively, we recommend that the authors acknowledge the sources of epistasis that they are not testing for given their experimental design and temper their conclusions accordingly.</p><p>3) No direct evidence is presented for positive selection of the three mutations deleterious in the ancestral strain. The authors should consider estimating dN/dS values at these specific sites, to the extent that they have enough data to do so.</p><p>4) An alternative hypothesis to explain the experimental observations is that throughout the course of the evolutionary trajectory there is a pattern of destabilizing mutations followed by stabilizing mutations, simply so that NP can maintain a roughly consistent folding energy. If so, the patterns shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6E</xref>, of the stabilizing mutations that precede each of the three focal deleterious mutations, would not be unique to these three special epistatic mutations, but rather would occur for many pairs of subsequent mutations along the evolutionary trajectory. Additional melting experiments would therefore provide stronger evidence for the conclusion that epistasis permitting <italic>adaptive</italic> mutations is the primary reason for observing stabilizing/destabilizing pairs.</p></body></sub-article><sub-article article-type="reply" id="SA2"><front-stub><article-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.00631.041</article-id><title-group><article-title>Author response</article-title></title-group></front-stub><body><p>During further data analysis and experiments that we performed subsequent to our initial submission, we discovered technical problems with the assay that we used to quantify protein concentrations for our earliest stability measurements.</p><p>We have repeated the affected measurements at the proper protein concentration.

To our knowledge, epistasis of the Kimura type has never been described for proteins, which would make this study even more exciting</italic>.</p><p>This comment is correct in that we over-emphasized the Maynard Smith paradigm (one mutation enabling a second without ever passing through a fitness valley). In several cases, our data are also consistent with two other paradigms: simultaneous mutations, or a deleterious mutation followed by a compensatory change. To address this issue, we have cited the Kimura and Meer papers. We have also revised relevant text, beginning with the Abstract where we replaced the statement “were preceded by stabilizing mutations” with “were preceded or accompanied by stabilizing mutations.” Finally, we have added a paragraph in the Discussion that discusses this issue.</p><p>However, we do not agree that our data preferentially support the Kimura’s paradigm over Maynard Smith’s in any of the cases. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2A</xref> shows the evolutionary trajectory as it can be reconstructed from available influenza sequences. The regions in red (such as those involving L259S/N334H and R384G/E375G) do not necessarily imply that the mutations occurred simultaneously – they simply indicate that they occurred sufficiently close in time that no viral isolates were sequenced in the intervening time period, making it impossible to determine the actual order.</p><p>In the revised manuscript, we specify that for two of the four epistatically interacting mutations, the evidence definitively support Maynard Smith’s paradigm (M136I preceded V280A, and S259L preceded R384G) – but that in the other two cases, we cannot resolve the relative order. However, we note that in both ambiguous cases, our data (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4A,B</xref>) show that it is possible to construct an evolutionary path consistent with Maynard Smith’s paradigm in that the mutations could have fixed sequentially without ever causing a measurable decrease in NP function (if N334H preceded L259S in the background of Step 10, and if E375G preceded R384G in the background of Step 21).</p><p><italic>Also, the issue of structural stability as being an important factor in compensatory interactions has been discussed before (see Kondrashov AS, Sunyaev S, Kondrashov FA.

We find the comparison with the Kondrashov et al paper to be particularly interesting, since our study is really an investigation of “compensated pathogenic deviations” in Brisbane/2007 NP relative to Aichi/1968 NP. The frequency of individually deleterious mutations that we identify (3 out of 34 unique mutations) is similar to the 10% frequency of compensated pathogenic deviations reported by Kondrashov et al. For reasons of brevity and scope, we have not expanded on this connection in the current manuscript, but it would be interesting to follow up on this connection in the future. For now, we cite the Kondrashov et al paper in the Discussion to briefly touch on the issue.</p><p>The DePristo et al paper is now cited in the Discussion. However, we note that there is a clear difference between the view introduced in that paper and what we find for NP. DePristo et al argue that there is selection to keep stability within a narrow margin, with either insufficient or extra stability being deleterious. In contrast, we find no evidence that extra stability is deleterious to NP – as shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7A</xref>, high stability has no measurable negative effect. We therefore think that our results support only half of the connection posited in the DePristo et al paper.</p><p>We have not cited the Toth-Petroczy and Tawfik paper mentioned above, but we have cited another paper by the same senior author (Bershtein et al, Science, 2006) that we believe more directly relates to our manuscript.</p><p><italic>2) The study is described as dissecting, within the noise limits of the assays, the full extent of epistasis along the evolutionary trajectory of NP. However, the authors assay each of 39 individual mutational effects in the context of the ancestor strain alone, as well as the specific mutations that help to alleviate three apparently deleterious mutations. Thus, there may be much more epistasis that has been important to the specific evolutionary trajectory that NP has taken than the authors have been able to assay, because the authors reconstruct mutations in the ancestral strain alone. Although we recognize the extent of the experimental work, there seems to be no good reason to distinguish the ancestral strain and look only for epistasis relative to mutational effects on that background. Consideration of a small (5?) additional number of reconstructed mutations in different backgrounds would strengthen the evidence for the authors’ conclusions, if none of these were to prove as destabilizing as the three that are at the center of the argument. We recognize that this additional work may take a considerable time and recommend that the authors consider this extension only if it can be pursued within a relatively short time. Alternatively, we recommend that the authors acknowledge the sources of epistasis that they are not testing for given their experimental design and temper their conclusions accordingly</italic>.</p><p>This is an important point. Our approach will not find all epistasis – it just finds mutations that are deleterious in the Aichi/1968 NP when the other genes are held constant. There are two ways our approach could “miss” epistasis, neither of which can feasibly be experimentally addressed in a systematic way (we appreciate that the reviewers recognize this, and are simply asking us to respond as best we can). Since we are uncertain which shortcoming is being referenced in the above comment, we discuss both here. We have addressed one with additional experimental data and the other by revising the text.</p><p>The first shortcoming is that we are looking at mutations to NP in a fixed background of other influenza genes. It is possible that some NP mutations could be rescued by mutations in other genes, which also evolved between 1968 and 2007.</p><p>Experimentally reconstructing all mutations in all viral genes is not feasible. However, several facts indicate that most of the NP epistasis in the timeframe we examined is intra-genic rather then inter-genic. First, all of the naturally occurring NP evolutionary intermediates are functional in a fixed genetic background of other genes. Second, we can explain the epistasis in terms of NP-intrinsic properties (such as stability) that do not involve other viral genes. To more firmly support this case, we have added new data in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s3">Figure 3—figure supplement 3</xref> that shows the effects of the three individually deleterious mutations (L259S, R384G, V280A) in three different backgrounds of polymerase genes: Aichi/1968, Nanchang/1995, and Brisbane/2007. As shown in this new figure supplement, the mutations are deleterious in all three backgrounds, supporting the idea that these mutations are constrained by epistasis inherent to NP itself.</p><p>The second shortcoming involves the approach we used to look for intra-genic epistasis in NP. It is possible that there are mutations that are not deleterious to either Aichi/1968 NP or the evolutionary intermediate in which they occurred (and so do not appear impaired in either <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3A</xref> or <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3B</xref>), but are still deleterious in some other NP genetic background. So the reviewers are correct in stating that we have not found all epistasis – we have just devised a systematic test for a specific subset of epistasis. We have revised the text to acknowledge this point. For example, in the Introduction we now say, “While this experimental strategy is not guaranteed to find every possible epistatic interaction along the evolutionary trajectory, it will systematically identify all mutations that have different effects in the original parent and the evolutionary intermediates in which they actually occurred.”</p><p>However, we do not feel it is feasible to address this point by further experimentation. First, introducing each mutation in every genetic background would require a massive number of additional experiments. Second, as we proceed along the evolutionary trajectory, the mutations already start to exist in the evolutionary intermediates, so it is not even possible to introduce them. For example, one might ask – do the mutations have the same effect in the final Brisbane/2007 NP as they do in the initial Aichi/1968 NP? However, the mutations are already present in the Brisbane/2007 NP, so it is not possible to introduce them into this background. One could imagine reverting mutations out of the Brisbane/2007 NP, but this is a conceptually different experiment, as it no longer involves introducing mutations in a forward evolutionary direction. However, if any other un-identified epistasis is mediated by stability, then <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7C</xref> with the new data we have added (described below in response to comment 4) suggests that we found the most individually destabilizing mutations along the trajectory.</p><p>The Aichi/1968 parent is one of the least stable naturally occurring sequences, so is sensitive to destabilizing mutations. If we had started with a more stable parent (such as Step 19), then we would have missed many destabilizing mutations since this more stable parent would have tolerated mutations that were deleterious to Aichi/1968 NP.</p><p><italic>3) No direct evidence is presented for positive selection of the three mutations deleterious in the ancestral strain. The authors should consider estimating dN/dS values at these specific sites, to the extent that they have enough data to do so</italic>.</p><p>In response to this comment, we have removed any specific references to “positive selection” and now merely make the well-supported claim that the three destabilizing mutations are enriched in experimentally characterized CTL epitopes and so likely to contribute to viral immune escape.</p><p>In our view, dN/dS values represent a statistical test that attempts to detect positive selection under certain assumptions. However, we believe it is preferable to use independent experimental evidence to determine whether a site is of value for immune escape (as we have done) rather than to rely on dN/dS. Typically papers that report methods for detecting positive selection (such as dN/dS) develop a statistical method and then validate it by testing whether it can identify sites with independent evidence for positive selection. We describe extensive experimental evidence culled from many independent citations that the sites in question are located in human CTL epitopes.</p><p>In addition, dN/dS tests are based on the idea that positively selected sites should change more rapidly than other sites (hence the elevation of dN over dS). But as we have shown, sites that contribute to CTL escape may be under strong constraint, and so may only be able to change under certain circumstance (in this case when they co-occur with stabilizing mutations), even if a change might be beneficial. This sort of epistasis would depress the rate of substitution at a site, reducing the signal in a dN/dS test even if a site is strongly targeted by CTLs. Nonetheless, we have performed dN/dS tests and added the results in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8s3">Figure 8—figure supplement 3</xref> and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD9-data">Figure 8—source code 2</xref>. The signal is weak, probably because of a lack of data. Although we have many hundreds of NP sequences, they are closely related and are derived from a phylogenetic tree with a trunk-like structure (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2B</xref>), which reduces the power of the analysis since the sequences all closely track a single line of descent. The three destabilizing mutations occur at sites for which the posterior probability of positive selection is higher than for the typical site in NP, but for none do the posterior probabilities of positive selection rise to &gt;95%. But conversely, none of the destabilizing mutations occur at sites for which the posterior probability of negative selection is &gt;80%, indicating that these sites are also unlikely to be under strong negative selection. The dN/dS test therefore is inconclusive about whether the sites are under positive or negative selection.</p><p><italic>4) An alternative hypothesis to explain the experimental observations is that throughout the course of the evolutionary trajectory there is a pattern of destabilizing mutations followed by stabilizing mutations, simply so that NP can maintain a roughly consistent folding energy. If so, the patterns shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6E</xref>, of the stabilizing mutations that precede each of the three focal deleterious mutations, would not be unique to these three special epistatic mutations, but rather would occur for many pairs of subsequent mutations along the evolutionary trajectory. Additional melting experiments would therefore provide stronger evidence for the conclusion that epistasis permitting</italic> adaptive <italic>mutations is the primary reason for observing stabilizing/destabilizing pairs</italic>.</p><p>Our initial manuscript was overly strong in its statement of the association between the stabilizing/destabilizing mutations and the adaptive mutations. We have revised the text and added experimental data as described below.</p><p>Our results show that stabilizing mutations make NP tolerant to destabilizing mutations, and that in many cases these destabilizing mutations contribute to immune escape. However, our results do not imply causality in terms of adaptive mutations being the reason for the stabilizing/destabilizing pairs. Our results do, however, argue against a hypothesis that has often been raised in the literature: too much stability is bad, so selection for constant stability actively favors destabilizing mutations after a stabilizing mutation. The evidence against this hypothesis is <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7A</xref>, which shows no measurable deleterious impact of extra NP stability – destabilizing a highly stable NP is neutral with respect to function, not beneficial.</p><p>We have elaborated on this issue with new experimental data: we have now measured the stabilities of all of the resolved evolutionary intermediates and added them to <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7</xref>. Previously we had just shown the stabilities of the evolutionary intermediates that immediately preceded or followed L259S, R384G, and V280A.</p><p>These new data show that stability indeed fluctuates during NP’s evolution. Although the largest decreases in stability are associated with the three mutations on which we focus (L259S, R384G, and V280A), other slightly destabilizing mutations are also fixed during NP’s evolution. We subscribe to the following interpretation: during its evolution, NP occasionally acquires stabilizing mutations that are neutral with respect to function (at least within the sensitivity of our experiments). Once these stabilizing mutations have occurred, the protein is tolerant to destabilizing mutations. It also remains tolerant to additional stabilizing mutations, but most frequently the next mutation will be destabilizing (it is well known that most random mutations are destabilizing).</p><p>Some of these destabilizing mutations are totally neutral, while others are neutral with respect to function but promote immune escape. These destabilizing mutations can fix by stochastic forces (drift, hitchhiking) or selective forces (immune escape). However, a mutation favored by selective forces will fix more frequently than one just driven just by stochastic forces, so the virus often fixes immune-escape mutations once they are accessible, explaining why the destabilizing mutations are enriched in CTL epitopes. After the protein has exhausted the extra stability provided by the original stabilizing mutation, selection disfavors further destabilizing mutations until the protein has again acquired a stabilizing mutation.</p><p>The explanation in the previous paragraph is our interpretation, but is too speculative to include directly in the manuscript text. We have included some more conservative mention of this issue in the Discussion. We have also re-written relevant portions of the text to emphasize that all we can conclusively claim is that there is a pattern of stabilizing/destabilizing mutations, and that the three most destabilizing mutations make disproportionate contributions to immune escape. For example, the last sentence of the original abstract read “… with stabilizing mutations permitting subsequent destabilizing but adaptive mutations.” We have changed this to read “… with stabilizing mutations permitting otherwise inaccessible destabilizing mutations which are sometimes of adaptive value.”</p><p><italic>Corrections to stability measurements performed at incorrect protein concentration</italic>:</p><p>During work subsequent to submission of our original manuscript, we discovered that some of our early stability measurements were performed at a protein concentration below 5 μM. We have repeated these measurements and replaced the affected data with our new measurements. We stress that although some of the numbers are slightly different, the changes do not alter any of the conclusions (the destabilizing mutations are still destabilizing and the stabilizing mutations are still stabilizing).</p><p>This problem arose because for the first few protein variants that we purified, we quantified concentration using a Bradford assay that appears to have been unreliable. After these first few variants, we switched to quantifying the concentration using the absorbance at 280 nm.</p><p>Originally, we had not realized that the Bradford assay concentrations were inaccurate because we analyzed the melting curves in normalized units. However, subsequent to our initial submission, we examined an overlay of all the CD traces and discovered that some traces had smaller magnitudes. We looked back at our notes and realized these were the variants quantified with the Bradford assay. We therefore re-purified these variants and measured their stabilities at the correct concentration as determined by absorbance at 280 nm. For these new measurements, the magnitudes of the CD traces are all similar, indicating the concentrations were accurate. In most cases, the stability measurements at the correct concentrations were higher by a fraction of a degree, suggesting slight concentration dependence to NP’s stability.</p><p>In this revised manuscript, we have replaced the old stability measurements with the new and slightly numerically different values. We have also introduced a new figure supplement (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6s3">Figure 6—figure supplement 3</xref>) that shows all CD traces. The melting curves (now <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6s4">Figure 6—figure supplement 4</xref>) are shown in non-normalized raw ellipticity, since normalization was disguising the problem of unequal concentrations in our earlier submission.</p><p>Below is a figure overlaying of all of the melting curves in non-normalized units. As can be seen from this figure (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig9">Author response image 1</xref>), the samples in red had lower magnitude in the old measurement set, but now have magnitudes comparable to the rest of the data in the new measurement set.<fig id="fig9" position="float"><label>Author response image 1</label><graphic xlink:href="elife-00631-resp-fig1-v1.tif"/></fig></p></body></sub-article></article>
