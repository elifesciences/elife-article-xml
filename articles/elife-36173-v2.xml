Although some indicators and models have been proposed for prognostication, any single method when used alone carries a high risk of false prediction. This study aimed to develop a multidomain prognostic model that combines resting state functional MRI with three clinical characteristics to predict one year-outcomes at the single-subject level. The model discriminated between patients who would later recover consciousness and those who would not with an accuracy of around 88% on three datasets from two medical centers. It was also able to identify the prognostic importance of different predictors, including brain functions and clinical characteristics. To our knowledge, this is the first reported implementation of a multidomain prognostic model that is based on resting state functional MRI and clinical characteristics in chronic disorders of consciousness, which we suggest is accurate, robust, and interpretable.</p></abstract><abstract abstract-type="executive-summary"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.36173.002</object-id><title>eLife digest</title><p>Severe brain injury can lead to disorders of consciousness (DOC), such as a coma.

sec-type="intro"><title>Introduction</title><p>Severe brain injury can lead to disorders of consciousness (DOC). Some patients recover consciousness after an acute brain insult, whereas others tragically fall into chronic DOC. The latter cannot communicate functionally or behave purposefully. Most patients remain bedridden, and require laborious care. The medical community is often confronted with an inability to meet the expectations of the chronic DOC patients' families. The social, economic, and ethical consequences are also tremendous (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Bernat, 2006</xref>). In parallel, although more validations are required, recent pilot studies have proposed new therapeutic interventions, which challenge the existing practice of early treatment discontinuation for a chronic DOC patient (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib64">Schiff et al., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Corazzol et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib81">Yu et al., 2017</xref>). However, before using these novel therapeutic interventions, clinicians first need to determine whether the patient is a suitable candidate. The availability of an accurate and robust prognostication is therefore a fundamental concern in the clinical management of chronic DOC patients, as medical treatment, rehabilitation therapy and even ethical decisions depend on this information.</p><p>To date, the prognostication for a DOC patient is based on physician observation of the patient's behavior over period that is sufficient to allow determination of whether there is any evidence of awareness. On the one hand, a patient's motor impairment, sensory deficit, cognitive damage, fluctuation of vigilance and medical complications could give rise to misjudgments; on the other hand, for the assessor, a lack of knowledge regarding DOC, poor training and non-use of adequate behavioral scales are additional elements that may contribute to a high possibility of mistakes. Consequently, careful and repeated behavioral assessments are considered to be particularly important for a precise diagnostic and prognostic judgment (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib75">Wannez et al., 2017</xref>). Nonetheless, behavioral assessments are inevitably subjective and vulnerable to a variety of personal interferences (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Giacino et al., 2009</xref>). Physicians and scientists have therefore been seeking accurate and objective markers for diagnosis and prognosis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Demertzi et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib54">Noirhomme et al., 2017</xref>).</p><p>Several pioneering studies have suggested that the etiology, incidence age and duration of DOC are important indicators for prognosis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib52">Multi-Society Task Force on PVS, 1994</xref>). Specifically, patients who have non-traumatic brain injury are expected to have a worse functional recovery than traumatic brain injury patients, and young patients were considered more likely to have a favorable outcome than older ones. During the recent decades, some pilot prognostic models have also been explored that are based on features of neurological examination (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib82">Zandbergen et al., 1998</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Booth et al., 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Dolce et al., 2008</xref>), abnormalities detected with electroencephalogram (EEG) and evoked potentials (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib69">Steppacher et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib40">Kang et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">Hofmeijer and van Putten, 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Chennu et al., 2017</xref>), anatomical and functional changes identified with brain computed tomography (CT), positron emission tomography (PET) and magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib48">Maas et al., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib66">Sidaros et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Neuro Imaging for Coma Emergence and Recovery Consortium et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib47">Luyt et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib68">Stender et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib79">Wu et al., 2015</xref>), and physiological and biochemical disturbances at both the brain and body levels (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">Kaneko et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib63">Rundgren et al., 2009</xref>). Despite many efforts, however, identifying efficient biomarkers for the early prediction of outcome is still challenging and requires additional research. One of the reasons for this is that the DOC could have many different causes and could be associated with several neuropathological processes and different severities, such that any method when used alone carries the risk of false prediction (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Bernat, 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib62">Rossetti et al., 2016</xref>).</p><p>Recently, resting state functional MRI (fMRI) has been widely used to investigate the brain functions of DOC patients. Research suggests that these patients demonstrate multiple changes in brain functional networks, including the default mode (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib74">Vanhaudenhuyse et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib67">Silva et al., 2015</xref>), executive control (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Demertzi et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib79">Wu et al., 2015</xref>), salience (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib59">Qin et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Fischer et al., 2016</xref>), and sensorimotor (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib80">Yao et al., 2015</xref>), auditory (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Demertzi et al., 2015</xref>), visual (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Demertzi et al., 2014a</xref>) and subcortical networks (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">He et al., 2015</xref>). The within-network and between-network functional connectivity appeared to be useful indicators of functional brain damage and the likelihood of consciousness recovery (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib67">Silva et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Di Perri et al., 2016</xref>). Taken together, these studies suggest that the brain networks and functional connectivity detected with resting state fMRI could be valuable biomarkers that can be used to trace the level of consciousness and predict the possibility of recovery.</p><p>With advances in medicine, prognostication of a DOC patient has moved toward a multidomain paradigm that combines clinical examination with the application of novel technologies (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Gosseries et al., 2014</xref>). Multidomain assessment has the potential to improve prediction accuracy. More importantly, it can provide reassurances about the importance of each predictor for prognostication by offering concordant evidence (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib70">Stevens and Sutter, 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib62">Rossetti et al., 2016</xref>). More than 20 years ago, the Multi-Society Task Force on persistent vegetative state (PVS) suggested that the etiology, incidence age and duration of DOC could help to predict the outcome (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib52">Multi-Society Task Force on PVS, 1994</xref>), and numerous studies have subsequently validated the clinical utility of these features (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">Jennett, 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Bruno et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Estraneo et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Celesia, 2016</xref>). Therefore, it is possible that a multidomain model that combines these clinical characteristics and resting state fMRI data could improve prognostic predictions at an individual level and could lead to the early identification of patients who could recover consciousness.</p><p>The present work had two major objectives. The first aim was to develop an approach to predict the prognosis of an individual DOC patient using clinical characteristics and resting state fMRI. The second aim, building on the first, was to further explore the different prognostic effects of these clinical and brain imaging features.</p></sec><sec id="s2" sec-type="materials|methods"><title>Materials and methods</title><p>The study paradigm is illustrated in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1</xref>. Resting state fMRI and clinical data from DOC patients were collected at the so-called <italic>T<sub>0</sub></italic> time point when the patients' vital signs and consciousness level had stabilized and a diagnosis had been made. Outcomes were assessed at least 12 months after this <italic>T<sub>0</sub></italic> time point; at a time referred to as the <italic>T<sub>1</sub></italic> time point. The principal scales included the Coma Recovery Scale Revised (CRS-R) and the Glasgow Outcome Scale (GOS). Instead of predicting diagnosis, this study used the outcome as a target for regression and classification. Using the resting state fMRI and clinical data from the <italic>T<sub>0</sub></italic> time point in a training dataset, a regression model was first developed to fit each patient's CRS-R score at the <italic>T<sub>1</sub></italic> time point, after which the optimal cut-off value for classifying individual patients on the basis of consciousness recovery was calculated.

In the ‘Beijing 750’ and ‘Beijing HDxt’ datasets, the patients underwent the evaluations at least twice weekly within the 2 weeks before the MRI scanning (i.e. the <italic>T<sub>0</sub></italic> time point). The highest CRS-R score was considered as the diagnosis. The CRS-R includes six subscales that address auditory, visual, motor, oromotor, communication, and arousal functions, which are summed to yield a total score ranging from 0 to 23.</p></sec><sec id="s2-2-2"><title>Outcome assessments</title><p>All patients were followed up at least 12 months after MRI scanning, according to the protocols for DOC described in a number of previous studies (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Neuro Imaging for Coma Emergence and Recovery Consortium et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib47">Luyt et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib68">Stender et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib57">Pignat et al., 2016</xref>). Basically, follow-up interviews were performed in four ways, including outpatient visit, assessments by local physicians, home visit, and telephone/video review. Whenever possible, signs of responsiveness were detected or reported, the patient was evaluated either in the unit or at home by the hospital staff. In cases where no change was signaled, patients were examined twice by one hospital physician via telephone/video reviews at the end of the follow-up process.</p><p>For the training dataset, ‘Beijing 750’, two outcome scales were assessed: the GOS and CRS-R. The GOS is one of the most commonly reported global scales for functional outcome in neurology, and provides a measurement of outcome ranging from 1 to 5 (1, dead; 2, vegetative state/minimally conscious state; 3, able to follow commands/unable to live independently; 4, able to live independently/unable to return to work or school; 5, good recovery/able to return to work or school). Although simple to use and highly reliable, the GOS score cannot provide detailed information about individual differences in consciousness level for DOC patients. By contrast, the CRS-R score can assist with prognostic assessment in DOC patients (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Giacino and Kalmar, 2006</xref>). The six subscales in the CRS-R comprise hierarchically arranged items that are associated with brain stem, subcortical and cortical processes. The lowest item on each subscale represents reflexive activity, whereas the highest items represent cognitively mediated behaviors. In order to simplify the modeling, we hypothesized that the higher the total CRS-R score at the follow-up, the better the outcome for the patient. We developed a regression model to fit each patient's CRS-R score at the <italic>T<sub>1</sub></italic> time point based on their clinical characteristics and resting state fMRI data, and designed a classification model to predict consciousness recovery or not for each patient. The classification accuracy was assessed by comparing the predicted label and the actual GOS score, that is, ‘consciousness recovery’ (GOS ≥ 3) versus ‘consciousness non-recovery’ (GOS ≤ 2).</p><p>The testing dataset ‘Beijing HDxt’ involved both the GOS scores and the CRS-R scores at the <italic>T<sub>1</sub></italic> time point for each patient.

During the MRI scanning, the participants did not take any sedative or anesthetic drugs. The resting state fMRI scan was obtained using a T<sub>2</sub>*-weighted gradient echo sequence, and a high-resolution T<sub>1</sub>-weighted anatomical scan was obtained to check whether the patients had large brain distortion or focal brain damage. For the training dataset, ‘Beijing 750’, the resting state fMRI acquisition parameters included TR/TE = 2000/30 ms, flip angle = 90°, axial 39 slices, thickness = 4 mm, no gap, FOV = 240 × 240 mm, matrix = 64 × 64, and 210 volumes (i.e. 7 min).

All resting-state fMRI scans were preprocessed using SPM8 (SPM, RRID:<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://scicrunch.org/resolver/SCR_007037">SCR_007037</ext-link>) and in-house Matlab codes. Specifically, the first five volumes of each subject were discarded. The remaining resting-state fMRI volumes were corrected for slice timing differences and realigned to the first volume to correct for inter-scan movements. The functional images were then spatially smoothed with a Gaussian kernel of 6 × 6 × 6 mm full-width at half maximum. Linear regression was used to remove the influence of head motion, whole brain signals and linear trends. The variables regressed out included 12 motion parameters (roll, pitch, yaw, translation in three dimensions and their first derivatives), the average series of the signals within the brain, and the regressors for linear trends.</p><p>Motion artifact is increasingly recognized as an important potential confound in resting state fMRI studies. Any particular motion may produce a wide variety of signal changes in the fMRI data, and may thus introduce complicated shifts in functional connectivity analysis. This problem was particularly serious for the DOC patients, as they were unlikely to follow the experimental instructions and control their head motion. To balance the demands of noise reduction and data preservation, we censored volumes that preceded or followed any movement (framewise displacement, FD) greater than 1.5 mm. The FD is a summarization of the absolute values of the derivatives of the translational and rotational realignment estimates (after converting the rotational estimates to displacement at 50 mm radius) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib58">Power et al., 2015</xref>). The head motion measures were achieved in the preprocessing step of realignment using SPM. To obtain reliable Pearson's correlations for functional connectivity, the patients with less than 50 volumes worth of remaining data were excluded. More information about the analysis and validation of controls for motion-related artifacts are provided in Appendix 4.</p><p>Finally, to reduce low-frequency drift and high-frequency noise, band-pass filtering (0.01–0.08 Hz) was only performed on volumes that survived motion censoring.</p></sec><sec id="s2-6"><title>Definition of networks and regions of interest</title><p>As noted in the introduction, multiple functional brain networks are disrupted in DOC patients. Among these impaired networks, six (the default mode, executive control, salience, sensorimotor, auditory, and visual networks) show system-level damages and significant correlations with behavioral assessments (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Demertzi et al., 2014</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">, 2015</xref>). We therefore defined a total of 22 regions of interest (ROIs) to probe these six brain networks. The definitions of the 22 ROIs were based on the results of a series of previous brain functional studies (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib65">Seeley et al., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib60">Raichle, 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Demertzi et al., 2015</xref>), and their names and Montreal Neurological Institute (MNI) coordinates are listed in Appendix 2.</p><p>The connection templates of the six brain networks were first investigated within the normal control group. In addition to the above-mentioned preprocessing stages, the resting state fMRI scans of the normal controls in the training dataset were transformed into MNI standard space. For each of the six networks, time series from the voxels contained in the various ROIs were extracted and averaged together. The averaged time series were then used to estimate whole-brain correlation r maps that were subsequently converted into normally distributed Fisher’s z-transformed correlation maps. Group functional connectivity maps for each of the six networks were then created with a one-sample t test (see Appendix 3 for details). Notably, the T map included both positive and negative values. We used the six T maps as the brain connection templates of the corresponding brain networks in the healthy population, which would assist to define one type of imaging features, that is the connection feature of the ROI. More information about the connection features of the ROIs are provided in the following section.</p><p>The conventional fMRI preprocess normalizes individual fMRI images into a standard space defined by a specific template image. Our goal was to extend this conventional approach to generate a functional connectivity image for each patient in his/her own imaging space. During the preprocessing of each patient’s fMRI scans, the 22 ROIs and six brain connection templates were therefore spatially warped to individual fMRI space and resampled to the voxel size of the individual fMRI image. We also developed tools to check the registration for each subject visually, some examples of which are provided in Appendix 5 and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="supp1">Supplementary file 1</xref>.</p></sec><sec id="s2-7"><title>Calculation of imaging features</title><p>We designed two types of imaging features from the resting state fMRI, one being the functional connectivity between each pair of 22 ROIs, and the other being the spatial resemblance between the functional connection patterns of each ROI and the brain connection templates across the whole brain. The functional connectivity was based on the Pearson’s correlation coefficients, while the spatial resemblance was conceptually similar to the template-matching procedure (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Greicius et al., 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib65">Seeley et al., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib74">Vanhaudenhuyse et al., 2010</xref>). The basis of template matching is that the greater the spatial consistency that exists between the template of a brain network and a specific connectivity map (for example, a component in an independent component analysis), the stronger the possibility that the connectivity map belongs to that brain network. Here, for each ROI of an individual DOC patient, we first computed the Pearson’s correlation coefficients between the time-course of the ROI and that of each voxel within the brain so as to obtain a functional connectivity map, and subsequently converted the functional connectivity map to a normally distributed Fisher’s z transformed correlation map. Next, we calculated the Pearson’s correlation coefficients between the Fisher’s z transformed correlation map and the corresponding brain connection template wrapped to individual fMRI space across each voxel within the brain. A greater correlation coefficient between the two maps suggests that there is more spatial resemblance between the functional connectivity map of the ROI and the normal brain connection template. Our assumption was that the more spatial consistency that existed between the connectivity map of the ROI in a DOC patient and the brain connection template, the more intact the corresponding brain function of the ROI in this individual. In this way, we defined the connection feature of the ROI with the spatial resemblance.</p><p>Overall, for each participant in this study, there were 231 (22 × 21/2) functional connectivity features and 22 brain area connection features.</p></sec><sec id="s2-8"><title>Imaging feature selection</title><p>Feature selection techniques have been widely adopted in brain analysis studies, in order to produce a small number of features for efficient classification or regression, and to reduce overfitting and increase the generalization performance of the model (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Fan et al., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Dosenbach et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Drysdale et al., 2017</xref>). Feature ranking and feature subset selection are two typical feature selection methods (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">Guyon and Elisseeff, 2003</xref>). Feature subset selection methods are generally time consuming, and even inapplicable when the number of features is extremely large, whereas ranking-based feature selection methods are subject to local optima. Therefore, these two feature selection methods are usually used jointly. Here, we first used a correlation-based feature selection technique to select an initial set of features, and then adopted a feature subset selection method for further selection.</p><p>As a univariate method, correlation-based feature selection is simple to run and understand, and measures the linear correlation between each feature and the response variable. Here, the image features (i.e. functional connectivity features and brain area connection features) that significantly correlated to the CRS-R scores at the <italic>T<sub>1</sub></italic> time point across the DOC patients in the training dataset were retained for further analysis.</p><p>Competitive adaptive reweighted sampling coupled with partial least squares regression (CARS-PLSR, <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://libpls.net/">http://libpls.net/</ext-link>) was then used for further feature subset selection (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib44">Li et al., 2009</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib45">, 2014</xref>). Briefly, CARS-PLSR is a sampling-based feature selection method that selects the key informative variables by optimizing the model's performance. As it provides the influence of each variable without considering the influence of the remainder of the variables, CARS-PLSR is efficient and fast in carrying out feature selection (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib50">Mehmood et al., 2012</xref>), and has therefore been used to explore possible biomarkers in medicine (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib72">Tan et al., 2010</xref>) and for wavelength selection in chemistry (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Fan et al., 2011</xref>). Using CARS-PLSR, we selected a subset of key informative imaging features.</p><p>Notably, both the correlation-based and CARS-PLSR feature selection methods filtered the features from the original feature set without any transformations. This made the prognostic regression model easier to interpret, as the imaging predictors were associated with either brain regions or functional connectivity.</p></sec><sec id="s2-9"><title>Prognostic modeling and assessments of predictor importance</title><p>PLSR is able to handle multicollinearity among the predictors well (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib78">Wold et al., 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib41">Krishnan et al., 2011</xref>). It was therefore used to generate the prognostic regression model in the training dataset ‘Beijing 750’. Given that clinical characteristics—including the etiology, incidence age and duration of DOC—have been verified as useful prognostic indicators, we designated the selected imaging features and the three clinical characteristics at the <italic>T<sub>0</sub></italic> time point as independent co-variates and the CRS-R score at the <italic>T<sub>1</sub></italic> time point as the dependent variable. Among the three clinical characteristics, the incidence age and duration of DOC were quantitative variables, whereas the etiology was a qualitative variable. In accordance with a previous study (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Estraneo et al., 2010</xref>), we categorized the etiology into three types: traumatic brain injury, stroke and anoxic brain injury. Thus, two dummy variables for etiology were designed and included in the model. Prior to model training, all involved predictors were centered and normalized (i.e. transformed into Z-scores). The prognostic regression model therefore took the imaging and clinical features as input and returned a predicted score as output. In the training dataset ‘Beijing 750’, we used cross-validation to decide that the number of latent variables for PLSR was three. To evaluate the regression model, the coefficient of determination R<sup>2</sup> between the predicted scores and the CRS-R scores at the <italic>T<sub>1</sub></italic> time point was calculated, and the Bland-Altman plot was used to measure the agreement between them.</p><p>Next, receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curves were plotted for the predicted scores. The optimal cut-off value for classifying an individual patient as having recovered consciousness or not was appointed to the point with the maximal sum of true positive and false negative rates on the ROC curve. Individual patients were classified as exhibiting recovery of consciousness if their predicted scores were higher than or equal to the cut-off value, otherwise as consciousness non-recovery. The classification accuracy was calculated by comparing the predicted label and the actual GOS score,that is 'consciousness recovery' (GOS ≥ 3) versus ‘consciousness non-recovery’ (GOS ≤ 2).</p><p>As model interpretation is an important task in most applications of PLSR, there has been considerable progress in the search for optimal interpretation methods (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib43">Kvalheim and Karstang, 1989</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib42">Kvalheim et al., 2014</xref>). In this study, using the Significant Multivariate Correlation (sMC) method (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib73">Tran et al., 2014</xref>), we assessed predictor importance in the prognostic regression model. The key points in sMC are to estimate the correct sources of variability resulting from PLSR (i.e. regression variance and residual variance) for each predictor, and use them to determine statistically a variable's importance with respect to the regression model. The F-test values (termed the sMC F-values) were used to evaluate the predictors' importance in the prognostic regression model.</p></sec><sec id="s2-10"><title>Internal validation of model</title><p>The prognostic regression model was internally validated using bootstrap sampling (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib71">Steyerberg, 2008</xref>). Specifically, bootstrap samples were drawn with replacement from the training dataset ‘Beijing 750’ such that each bootstrap sampling set had a number of observations equal to that of the training dataset. Using a bootstrap sampling set, correlation-based feature selection and CARS-PLSR were first used to select the feature subset, after which the PLSR was used to generate a prognostic model.

The model discriminated between patients who would later recover consciousness and those who would not with an accuracy of around 88% in three datasets from two medical centers. It was also able to identify the prognostic importance of different predictors, including brain functions and clinical characteristics. To our knowledge, this is the first reported implementation of a multidomain prognostic model that is based on resting state fMRI and clinical characteristics in chronic DOC. We therefore suggest that this novel prognostic model is accurate, robust, and interpretable. For research only, we share the prognostic model and its Matlab code at a public download resource (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://github.com/realmsong504/pDOC">https://github.com/realmsong504/pDOC</ext-link>; copy archived at <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://github.com/elifesciences-publications/pDOC)">https://github.com/elifesciences-publications/pDOC</ext-link>).</p><p>Brain functions are mediated by the interactions between neurons within different neural circuits and brain regions. Functional imaging can detect the local activity of different brain regions and explore the interactions between them, and has demonstrated potential for informing diagnosis and prognosis in DOC. On the one hand, many studies have focused on one modality of brain functional imaging, such as PET (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib56">Phillips et al., 2011</xref>), SPECT (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib53">Nayak and Mahapatra, 2011</xref>), task fMRI (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib55">Owen et al., 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Coyle et al., 2015</xref>), or resting state fMRI (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Demertzi et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib59">Qin et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib79">Wu et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib61">Roquet et al., 2016</xref>). On the other hand, some cross-modality studies have compared the diagnostic precision between imaging modalities, for example, comparing PET imaging with task fMRI (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib68">Stender et al., 2014</xref>) or comparing PET, EEG and resting state fMRI (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Golkowski et al., 2017</xref>). In our study, by combining brain functional networks detected from resting state fMRI with three clinical characteristics, we built a computational model that allowed us to make predictions regarding the prognosis of DOC patients at an individual level. We compared the models separately using only the imaging features or only the clinical characteristics and found that the combination of these predictors achieved greater accuracy. This validated the need for the use of accumulative evidence stemming from multiple assessments, each of which has different sensitivity and specificity in detecting the capacity for recovery of consciousness (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Demertzi et al., 2017</xref>). Validations in additional and unseen datasets were also undertaken to evaluate the feasibility of the predictive model. Our results showed about 88% average accuracy across the two testing datasets, and good sensitivity and specificity in both the ‘subacute’ patients (i.e. 1 months ≤ duration of unconsciousness ≤ 3 months) and those in the prolonged phase (i.e. duration of unconsciousness &gt;3 months), which suggested good robustness and the generalizability of our model.</p><p>Further, the sensitivity of 83% and 100% obtained across the two testing datasets demonstrated a low false-negative rate, which would avoid predicting non-recovery in a patient who can actually recover. Our method successfully identified 16 out of the total 18 patients who later recovered consciousness in the two testing datasets. In parallel, the specificity across the two testing datasets was up to 92% and 83%, respectively. Taken together, these results suggest that our method can precisely identify those patients with a high-potential for recovery consciousness and concurrently reduce false positives in predicting low-potential patients. In addition, although it has been widely considered that the prospect of a clinically meaningful recovery is unrealistic for prolonged DOC patients (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib77">Wijdicks and Cranford, 2005</xref>), our model correctly predicted 9 out of 10 DOC patients with longer than or equal to three months duration of DOC who subsequently recovered consciousness, including three patients with DOC longer or equal to 6 months duration, suggesting that it can also be applied to prolonged DOC patients.</p><p>According to the surviving consciousness level, DOC patients can be classified into distinct diagnostic entities, including VS/UWS and MCS. As MCS is often viewed as a state with a potentially more favorable outcome (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib46">Luauté et al., 2010</xref>), a misdiagnosis of VS/UWS could heavily bias the judgment of the prognosis, the medical treatment options and even the associated ethical decisions. Some influential studies have found that a few VS/UWS patients exhibit near-normal high-level cortical activation in response to certain stimuli or commands (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib55">Owen et al., 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib51">Monti et al., 2010</xref>), and that late recovery of responsiveness and consciousness is not exceptional in patients with VS/UWS (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Estraneo et al., 2010</xref>). Instead of predicting diagnosis, this study used one-year outcome as a target for regression and classification. Our method, which is based on the combined use of clinical and neuroimaging data, successfully identified seven out of the eight VS/UWS patients in the testing dataset who were initially diagnosed as VS/UWS but subsequently achieved a promising outcome.</p><p>By analyzing the sMC F-value for each predictor in the regression model, we investigated the prognostic effects of these predictors. In particular, the sMC F-value of the incidence age was greater than that of the other clinical characteristics, suggesting that incidence age might be the most important predictor among the clinical characteristics. Notably, the sMC F-value for the imaging features as a whole seemed to be greater than that for the clinical features, as shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4B</xref>. We therefore speculate that the patient's residual consciousness capacity, indicated by brain networks and functional connectivity detected from resting state fMRI, might have a stronger prognostic effect than their clinical characteristics.</p><p>Some previous studies have shown that the resting state functional connectivity within the default mode network is decreased in severely brain-damaged patients, in proportion to their degree of consciousness impairment, from locked-in syndrome to minimally conscious, vegetative and coma patients (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib74">Vanhaudenhuyse et al., 2010</xref>). Moreover, the reduced functional connectivity within the default mode network, specifically between the MPFC and the PCC, may predict the outcome for DOC patients (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib67">Silva et al., 2015</xref>). Our model also validates that the aMPFC and PCC in the default mode network play important roles in predicting prognosis.</p><p>Above all, we found that the functional connectivity between the aMPFC and the DMPFC had the maximum sMC F-value in the prognostic regression model. The aMPFC is one of the core brain areas in the default mode network, whereas the DMPFC is located in the executive control network. Previous studies have demonstrated that this functional connectivity is negative connectivity in normal healthy populations, with the anti-correlation being proposed as one reflection of the intrinsic functional organization of the human brain (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Fox et al., 2005</xref>). The default mode network directly contributes to internally generated stimulus-independent thoughts, self-monitoring, and baseline monitoring of the external world, while the executive control network supports active exploration of the external world. Correct communication and coordination between these two intrinsic anti-correlated networks is thought to be very important for optimal information integration and cognitive functioning (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Buckner et al., 2008</xref>). A recent study reported that negative functional connectivities between the default mode network and the task-positive network were only observed in patients who recovered consciousness and in healthy controls, whereas positive values were obtained in patients with impaired consciousness (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Di Perri et al., 2016</xref>). Further, our regression model suggests that the anti-correlations between these two diametrically opposed networks (i.e. the default mode network and the executive control network) should be the most crucial imaging feature for predicting the outcomes of the DOC patients. We therefore conclude that our prognostic model has good interpretability, and that it not only verifies the findings of previous studies but also provides a window to assess the relative significance of various predictors for the prognosis of DOC patients.</p><p>This study involved two testing datasets, which were found to be quite different, as shown in <xref ref-type="table" rid="table1">Table 1</xref>. First, the distributions of the etiology of the patients were remarkably different in the two datasets. The numbers of patients suffering from trauma/stroke/anoxia were 12/6/7 and 8/0/16 in the ‘Beijing HDxt’ and ‘Guangzhou HDxt’ datasets, respectively. The outcomes were also different. In the ‘Beijing HDxt’ dataset, 12 out of the total 25 patients recovered consciousness, compared with six out of the total 24 patients in the ‘Guangzhou HDxt’ dataset. Given that the characteristics of the two medical centers and their roles in the local health care system are different, we speculate that this could be one of the main reasons why the enrolled patient populations were heterogeneous. As described in the Introduction, DOC can have many causes and can be associated with several neuropathological processes and different severities, leading to the suggestion that information from different domains should be integrated to improve diagnosis and prognostication (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Bernat, 2016</xref>). Our study demonstrates that the combination of imaging and clinical features can achieve a better performance than the use of single domain features.</p><p>However, some caution is warranted. First, although this study involved 112 DOC patients, the number of patients who would later recover consciousness was relatively low (i.e. 31/112). So, a much larger cohort will be needed for further validation. Second, the PPVs for the two testing datasets were remarkably different, with that for the ‘Guangzhou HDxt’ dataset being relatively low (67% versus 91%). Although our method predicted that nine patients in this dataset would recover consciousness, only six of them did (i.e. GOS ≥3), with the other three remaining unconscious at the end of the follow-up (i.e. GOS ≤2). Given that many additional factors are associated with the outcome of DOC patients, including medical complications, nutrition and so on, future work will need to integrate more information in order to provide more precise predictions. Third, the signal-to-noise ratio of resting state fMRI can influence functional connectivity analysis, so calibrations will be necessary when applying the predictive model across different sites, including standardizing the MRI acquisition protocols (e.g. scanner hardware, imaging protocols and acquisition sequences) and the patients' management strategies (see Appendix 10 for more information). Finally, a DOC patient’s prognosis can be considered according to at least three dimensions: survival/mortality, recovery of consciousness, and functional recovery. This study focused on predicting recovery of consciousness, and the patients who died during the follow-up were excluded. In the future, we will consider more outcome assessments, including survival/mortality and functional recovery.</p><p>In summary, our prognostic model, which combines resting state fMRI with clinical characteristics, is proposed to predict the one-year outcome of DOC patients at an individual level. The average accuracy of classifying a patient as ‘consciousness recovery’ or not was around 88% in the training dataset and two unseen testing datasets. Our model also has good interpretability, thereby providing a window to reassure physicians and scientists about the significance of different predictors, including brain networks, functional connectivities and clinical characteristics. Together, these advantages could offer an objective prognosis for DOC patients that will optimize their management and deepen our understanding of brain function during unconsciousness.</p></sec></body><back><ack id="ack"><title>Acknowledgements</title><p>The authors appreciate the help of Ms Rowan Tweedale with the use of English in this paper. This work was partially supported by the Natural Science Foundation of China (Grant Nos. 81471380, 91432302, 31620103905), the Science Frontier Program of the Chinese Academy of Sciences (Grant No. QYZDJ-SSW-SMC019), the National Key R and D Program of China (Grant No. 2017YFA0105203), the Beijing Municipal Science and Technology Commission (Grant Nos.

physicians according to the CRS-R scale. Patients were diagnosed as MCS when they demonstrated at least one of the following behaviors: (1) following simple commands; (2) yes/no responses (gestural or verbal); (3) intelligible verbalization; (4) purposeful behavior in response to an environmental stimulus; (5) vocalization or gestures in direct response to questions; (6) reaching for objects that demonstrates a clear relationship between the position of the object and the direction of the movement; (7) touching or holding objects; (8) following or staring at an object in direct response to its movement. Emergence from the MCS was signaled by the return of functional communication and/or object use.</p><p>In this study, the patients underwent the CRS-R assessments twice weekly (or more) within the two weeks before MRI scanning. So, the CRS-R was generally administered about 4–5 times for each patient. The highest CRS-R score was considered as the diagnosis and listed in the following tables.

Moreover, several networks have been found to be spatially consistent across different healthy subjects (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Damoiseaux et al., 2006</xref>). Researchers suggested that the brain networks assessed by resting state fMRI may reflect an intrinsic functional architecture of the brain (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib60">Raichle, 2011</xref>). As mentioned in the manuscript, multiple networks were reported to be disrupted in the DOC patients. Here, the connection templates of the six brain networks were investigated within the healthy control group of the ‘Beijing 750’ dataset. This study focused on the cortex, so six functional networks were investigated, including the default mode network, the executive control network, salience, and the sensorimotor, auditory, and visual networks. Group functional connectivity maps for each of the six networks were created with a one-sample t test as shown in the following <xref ref-type="fig" rid="app3fig1">Appendix 3—figure 1</xref>.

Different MRI acquisition protocols (e.g. scanner hardware, imaging protocols and acquisition sequences) can influence the imaging SNR. But, it is not trivial to estimate the SNR in resting-state fMRI because the noise is complex and also differs spatially. Here, we calculated the temporal SNR (tSNR) as the ratio between the mean fMRI signal and its temporal standard deviation in each voxel (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib76">Welvaert and Rosseel, 2013</xref>), and then averaged across all voxels in each region of interest (ROI) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Gardumi et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">Hay et al., 2017</xref>). As there were 22 ROIs in this study, the median of these 22 ROI tSNR values was used as the measure for evaluating the SNR of the fMRI. We then correlated the median tSNR with the predicted imaging subscores across all of the NC subjects (n = 40), and found that there were significant correlations between them (Pearson's correlation r = 0.36, p=0.024) as shown in<xref ref-type="fig" rid="app9fig2">Appendix 9—figure 2</xref>.</p><fig id="app9fig2" position="float"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.36173.041</object-id><label>Appendix 9—figure 2.</label><caption><title>The correlations between the fMRI signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) and the predicted imaging subscores in the healthy controls.</title></caption><graphic mime-subtype="x-tiff" mimetype="image" xlink:href="elife-36173-app9-fig2-v2"/></fig><p>From the above two experiments, we found that (1) the fMRI tSNR could be one of influencing factors in the application of the presented model; (2) the predicted imaging subscores for the NC subjects could be approximate across different sites when the tSNR was proximity. Therefore, we suggested that our presented model can be applied to different centers, although the calibration might be required. Further, the tSNR in fMRI is not only associated with instrumental noise but also modulated by subject-related noise, such as physiological fluctuations and motion artifacts (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">Huettel et al., 2009</xref>). Therefore, we suggest that, on the one hand, the quality of imaging acquisition, including MRI scanner and imaging sequence/parameters, need to be guaranteed; and on the other hand, scanning protocols is required to be standardized to reduce the subject-related noise during the scanning.</p></boxed-text></sec></app></app-group></back><sub-article article-type="decision-letter" id="SA1"><front-stub><article-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.36173.058</article-id><title-group><article-title>Decision letter</article-title></title-group><contrib-group><contrib contrib-type="editor"><name><surname>Stephan</surname><given-names>Klaas Enno</given-names></name><role>Reviewing Editor</role><aff><institution>University of Zurich and ETH Zurich</institution><country>Switzerland</country></aff></contrib></contrib-group></front-stub><body><boxed-text><p>In the interests of transparency, eLife includes the editorial decision letter and accompanying author responses.

Your article has been reviewed by Timothy Behrens as the Senior Editor, a Reviewing Editor, and three reviewers. The following individuals involved in review of your submission have agreed to reveal their identity: Klaas Enno Stephan (Reviewer #1); Adrian M Owen (Reviewer #2); Jessica Schrouff (Reviewer #3).</p><p>The reviewers have discussed the reviews with one another and the Reviewing Editor has drafted this decision to help you prepare a revised submission.</p><p>Summary:</p><p>This is a very interesting and timely study that examines the predictability of clinical outcome of patients with disorders of consciousness (DOC), based on &quot;resting state&quot; functional MRI and clinical data. It reports that both clinical data and neuroimaging data can separately predict individual clinical outcomes, but that the combined usage of both sources of information is superior.</p><p>The reviewers agreed that this study represents a potentially important attempt towards establishing practically useful predictors based on data that can be obtained in clinical practice. For DOC, the sample size is large, and the use of two separate test datasets is laudable. Having said this, we also identified several major concerns with regard to the statistical approach and the interpretation of the results. These are detailed below.</p><p>Essential revisions:</p><p>1) There are several concerns regarding the statistical approach taken. A main issue that featured in the discussion among reviewers is that feature selection and model performance assessment were performed without nested cross-validation. This should be done to obtain an accurate estimate of model performance in the training data set as well. In the present scenario in the paper, performance measures derived from the training set cannot be used as an estimate of the model's generalization ability. At present, the abstract and discussion are slightly misleading in that they report an average accuracy over training and validation sets. Second, the reasons for double feature selection (given the relatively low number of features) and, more generally, for the choice of PLSR are unclear. As the method is put forward in this work, comparison with simpler methods would be useful (e.g. vanilla SVM). Third, it is unclear how the bootstrap was used to perform internal validation. It only performs validation of the training samples. Typically, the trained model would be applied to the subjects not used in that bootstrap sample and the R2 would be computed based on those. Otherwise, the R2 value does not represent generalizability, but only goodness of fit. If this is a misunderstanding, this paragraph should be revised. Fourth, what regularisation was applied in PLSR? Fifth, there is little discussion of the PPV, while assessing the number of false negative is also very important. In all cases, statistical assessment through permutations of the labels is desired. Finally, when evaluating the performance of classification, it would be more convincing if you reported the balanced accuracy. This is because the results for the two different test datasets differ remarkably with respect to sensitivity (subsection “Accuracy comparison between single-domain models and combination model”); this suggests that the outcome groups were differentially balanced across the datasets.</p><p>2) The interpretation of classifier weights is problematic (Discussion section): Please see Haufe et al., 2014, Kia et al., 2017 and Weichwald et al., 2015 for the caveats of interpreting the weights of classification models. Especially, as feature selection is performed here, the authors could refrain from looking at the weights (and especially at their sign; for example, finding that duration of DOC has positive impact on outcome does not seem realistic) and instead identify which features were selected.</p><p>3) It is not clear that excluding patients who died is the right thing to do. At the very least, whether it was the right thing to do should have been discussed. On the one hand, I appreciate that if they died, one can never know if they would have regained consciousness. But in my experience (and I am sure this is the authors' experience too), these patients mostly die for a reason that is related to their initial injury (directly or indirectly). Plus, whether they die or not is of course part and parcel of the prognostication (Can we predict those who die?). I know the paper's intention was to try to predict recovery of consciousness (rather than who died), but I think an argument can be made for including those who died in the 'non recovery of consciousness' group. How does that affect the model? After all, a model that says, &quot;Assuming you live, these data have an 88% chance of predicting whether you will regain consciousness&quot; is nowhere near as good as a model that says, &quot;These data have an 88% chance of predicting whether you will regain consciousness&quot;.</p><p>4) Subsection “MRI acquisition”. Supplementary material 1 shows quite a bit of variation in the time after injury at which the MRI was conducted (in the testing dataset alone, the range is 1 month to 77 months). What is noticeable is that almost all those who have a late scan do not recover. On the one hand, this is obvious – if you are still vegetative after 77 months you are very unlikely to recover whether you have a scan or not, and in this sense, the point of trying to 'predict recovery' is less obvious. Plus of course at this point there will have been many brain changes that do not reflect the original injury per se but may be the consequences of languishing in this stage for some years (atrophy, etc.). What would be most interesting would be to see how the model does with patients who, say are scanned within 3 months of their injury. These are the patients that we really care about because if we could prognosticate among them then it could really change clinical practice. To put it simply, including data from a patient who has been in a MCS for 77 months or VS for 54 months and predicting that they will not recover is not adding much (and may be affecting the model), because the chances of any meaningful recovery at that stage is so low anyway.</p><p>5) fMRI analysis: How were brain lesions taken into account? This could influence the functional connectivity measures considerably.</p><p>6) fMRI motion correction (subsection “Imaging preprocessing”): The application of band-pass filtering to &quot;scrubbed&quot; fMRI timeseries is not unproblematic given that the removal of scans from the time series can severely affect temporal autocorrelation. Also, were there significant differences in the number of scrubbed volumes between the outcome groups (for unresponsive patients, movement would seem to be less of an issue than for controls or more responsive patients), and could this have affected regression/classification? Did you consider using scan-nulling regressors as an alternative? (see, for example, the discussion in Caballero-Gaudes and Reynolds, 2017) In SM4, please split the graphs by outcome. If more movement was observed for one subtype of patients, this could drive all the observed results.</p><p>7) Subsection “Accuracy comparison between single-domain models and combination model”: When only the clinical features are included in the authors model the accuracy in the Guangzhou dataset is 83%. When both clinical and imaging features are included it is 88%. Given the rather small size of the sample, this seems to amount to a difference of one patient which is neither here nor there in terms of clinical prognostication. It's not wildly different for the other dataset either. Can you please comment on this? More generally, it seems overstated how much better the combined features did in the model – this would need a critical discussion but also better quantification. In other words, how much more is gained exactly by using both datasets as opposed to either dataset alone? Please report details of the statistical superiority of the combined feature set (p-value, effect size). Also, when you directly compare neuroimaging data and clinical data, is there any difference in how well they support prediction?</p><p>8) It is laudable that the code of the statistical model for predictions is made available. Will the code for the analysis pipeline and the data also be made available?</p><p>9) The structure and writing of the paper could be improved. In particular, some of the 'sign-posting' in the article is poor. For example, 'normal controls' are referred to in subsection “Subjects” and subsection “Definition of networks and regions of interest” and so on, but we never really learn much about them until the Results section. This had the unfortunate consequence of making the article feel very vague and lacking important details. They were mostly revealed much later (in the Supplementary material) but better sign posting earlier on would help with that. Likewise, in the Materials and methods section &quot;The two testing datasets were then used to validate the model&quot;. This comes out of nowhere, and one has no idea what the authors were referring to at this point. Likewise, in the Materials and methods section &quot;All patients were followed up at least 12 months after the T0 time point&quot; sounds vague and under specified. A sign post to Supplementary material 1 would have really helped.</p><p>10) Discussion section. At least two of these three references (the ones that I am an author on) do not support the point being made at all. In neither Owen et al., 2006 nor Monti et al., 2010 was &quot;recovery after many years&quot; observed.</p></body></sub-article><sub-article article-type="reply" id="SA2"><front-stub><article-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.36173.059</article-id><title-group><article-title>Author response</article-title></title-group></front-stub><body><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Essential revisions:</p><p>1) There are several concerns regarding the statistical approach taken.</p><p>A main issue that featured in the discussion among reviewers is that feature selection and model performance assessment were performed without nested cross-validation.

Thus, for each participant in this study, there were 231 (22×21/2) functional connectivity features and 22 brain area connection features. Although the total number of imaging features (i.e. 253) is low in comparison to the number of image voxels, it is more than the number of patients in the training dataset (i.e. 63 patients). In addition, we found that there was multi-collinearity in these 253 imaging features. The maximum correlation coefficient was up to 0.7985 (Pearson's correlation, p=4.5174e-015, uncorrected). Therefore, standard linear regression would fail in this study.</p><p>PLSR is a powerful and effective method to handle these sorts of problematic data sets. It can predict a response from a set of high-dimensional and collinear predictors. This prediction is achieved by extracting from the predictors a set of orthogonal factors called latent variables which have the best predictive power. PLSR has been widely used in a variety of fields (Wold et al., 2001), including fMRI data analysis (Krishnan et al., 2011). This is the reason that we chose to use PLSR in this study.</p><p>In addition, we hoped to use as few imaging features as possible in the predictive model, which could prove helpful to interpret and understand the model. We therefore carried out feature selection. Feature selection techniques have been widely adopted in brain analysis studies, in order to produce a small number of features for efficient classification or regression, and to reduce overfitting and increase the generalization performance of the model. Feature ranking and feature subset selection are two typical feature selection methods. Feature subset selection methods are generally time consuming, and even inapplicable when the number of features is extremely large, whereas ranking-based feature selection methods are subject to local optima. Therefore, these two feature selection methods are usually used jointly. Here, we first used a correlation-based feature ranking to select an initial set of features, and then adopted the CARS-PLSR method for further feature subset selection.</p><p>We have added some comparison with linear SVM. The code for SVM was downloaded from LIBSVM (https://www.csie.ntu.edu.tw/~cjlin/libsvm/). The 253 imaging features and the four clinical features were integrated into one feature vector.

In the chapter 5 of Steyerberg, (2008), optimism is defined as true performance minus apparent performance, where true performance refers to the performance in the underlying population, and apparent performance refers to the estimated performance in the sample. Bootstrapping can be used to quantify the optimism of a prediction model. This optimism is subsequently subtracted from the original estimate to obtain an “optimism-corrected” performance estimate.

Specifically, bootstrap samples were drawn with replacement from the training dataset &quot;Beijing 750&quot; such that each bootstrap sampling set had a number of observations equal to that of the training dataset. Using a bootstrap sampling set, the correlation-based feature selection and CARS-PLSR was first used to select feature subset, after which the PLSR was used to generate a prognostic model. We then applied the model to the bootstrap sampling set and the original training dataset and calculated the coefficient of determination <italic>R<sup>2</sup></italic> of each of the two datasets. The difference between the two coefficients of determination was defined as the optimism. The process was repeated 1000 times to obtain a stable estimate of the optimism.

We used cross-validation to decide that the number of latent variables was 3.

Our method predicted that nine patients in this dataset would recover consciousness recovery, but only six of them did (i.e. GOS score≥3), with the other three patients remaining unconsciousness at the end of the follow-up. In the two testing datasets, our method successfully identified the 16 out of the total 18 patients (16/18) who later recovered consciousness. That is, the number of false negatives was two.</p><p>We have added some discussion in Discussion section as follows.</p><p>&quot;Secondly, the PPVs for the two testing datasets was remarkably different, with that for the &quot;Guangzhou HDxt&quot; dataset being relatively low (67% versus 91%).

In the &quot;Beijing_HDxt&quot; dataset, 12 out of the total 25 patients recovered consciousness, while six out of the total 24 patients recovered consciousness in the &quot;Guangzhou_HDxt&quot; dataset. In fact, the etiology for the patients was remarkably different in the two datasets. The number of patients in trauma/stroke/anoxia cohorts were 12/6/7 and 8/0/16 in the &quot;Beijing_HDxt&quot; and &quot;Guangzhou_HDxt&quot; dataset, respectively. Given that the characteristics of the two medical centers and their roles in the local health care system are different, we speculate that the enrolled patient populations might be different, which could be one reason why the outcome groups were differentially balanced across the two datasets. However, we would like to emphasize that these etiologies are the main sources of DOC, and a good prognostication method should be applicable to different etiologies and to different datasets from different medical centers.</p><p>Using the predicted scores of the patients in the two testing datasets, we plotted the ROC curves for each of the two testing datasets as follows.</p><fig id="respfig3"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.36173.045</object-id><label>Author response image 3.</label><caption/><graphic mime-subtype="jpeg" mimetype="image" xlink:href="elife-36173-resp-fig3-v2"/></fig><p>From the above figure, we can see that the AUC for each of the two testing datasets is larger than 0.9, although there are some differences between them in terms of the ROC.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>2) The interpretation of classifier weights is problematic (Discussion section): Please see Haufe et al., 2014, Kia et al., 2017 and Weichwald et al., 2015 for the caveats of interpreting the weights of classification models. Especially, as feature selection is performed here, the authors could refrain from looking at the weights (and especially at their sign; for example, finding that duration of DOC has positive impact on outcome does not seem realistic) and instead identify which features were selected.</p></disp-quote><p>We believe that the interpretation of &quot;classifier weights&quot; that the reviewer mentioned should refer to the regression weights in the PLSR.</p><p>According to the reviewer's suggestion, we reviewed the studies on the interpretation of weights of linear models in neuroimaging analysis. These studies, including Haufe et al., (2014), Kia et al., (2017) and Weichwald et al., (2015), are very instructive. They illustrated the source of the problem and provided some general discussions and heuristic rules. In addition, we reviewed some specific literatures focusing on the interpretation of predictor importance in PLSR. Given that model interpretation is an important task in most applications of PLSR, researchers have been looking for optimal interpretation methods and have made considerable progress (Kvalheim and Karstang, 1989; Kvalheim et al., 2014; Tran et al., 2014).</p><p>In summary, as the reviewer pointed out, directly interpreting the model using model parameters such as the weights and loadings in the PLSR is a problematic exercise. Therefore, we have used one recent method (Tran et al., 2014), i.e. significance Multivariate Correlation (sMC), to analyze the predictor importance in our PLSR model. We have corrected the relevant results and added some discussions to the manuscript. In the following, we will firstly elaborate the cause of problem, and then introduce the sMC method for interpreting variable importance in PLSR. After that, we will present our new results.</p><p>Cause of problem:</p><p>In Haufe et al., (2014), it was demonstrated that linear backward models, i.e. linear decoding models, cannot be interpreted in terms of weight, as a large weight does not necessarily correspond to a feature that picks up the signal and, vice-versa, a feature that picks up the signal does not necessarily have a large weight. For example, consider a simple regression case with two predictors, <italic>X</italic> = [<italic>x<sub>1</sub>(n) χ2(n)</italic>], and a response <italic>y(n)</italic>. Imagine that <italic>y(n)=signal(n)</italic>, and <italic>x<sub>1</sub>(n)=signal(n)-2*noise(n)</italic> and <italic>χ2(n)=noise(n)</italic>, where the <italic>noise(n)</italic> is random noise and independent of the <italic>signal(n)</italic>. Thus, we can easily get <italic>y(n) = x<sub>1</sub>(n)</italic> +2* <italic>χ2(n)</italic>. The weight for <italic>χ2(n)</italic> is larger than the weight for <italic>x<sub>1</sub>(n)</italic>. However, it is evident that <italic>χ2(n)</italic> is just noise and could be any value. In this case, the weight does not reflect variable importance. In fact, the weights are determined not only by the correlation of <italic>X</italic> to the response <italic>y</italic>, but also concurrently by the covariance in <italic>X</italic>.</p><p>Therefore, some researchers suggest that the lack of interpretability of multivariate decoding in neuroimaging could be a direct consequence of low signal-to-noise ratios, the high dimensionality of neuroimaging, high correlations among different dimensions of data, and cross-subject variability (Kia et al., 2017).</p><p>Introduction of the sMC method:</p><p>The goal of PLSR is to predict <italic>Y</italic> from <italic>X</italic> and to describe their common structure (Krishnan et al., 2011). It finds latent variables stored in a matrix <italic>T</italic> that model <italic>X</italic> and simultaneously predict <italic>Y</italic>. Formally this is expressed as a double decomposition of <italic>X</italic> and the predicted Y^:</p><p>X=TPTandY^=TBCT (Eq. 1)</p><p>where <italic>P</italic> and <italic>C</italic> are loadings (or weights) and <italic>B</italic> is a diagonal matrix. These latent variables are ordered according to the amount of variance of Y^ that they explain. Rewriting Eq. (1) shows that Y^ can also be expressed as a regression model as:</p><p>Y^=TBCT=XBPLS (Eq. 2)</p><p>with</p><p>BPLS=PT+BCT (eq. 3)</p><p>where PT+ is the Moore-Penrose pseudo-inverse of PT. The matrix BPLS is equivalent to the regression weights of multiple regression. From the above equations, we can see that PLSR finds components from <italic>X</italic> that are also relevant for <italic>Y</italic>. Specifically, PLSR searches for a set of components (called latent vectors) that performs a simultaneous decomposition of <italic>X</italic> and <italic>Y</italic> with the constraint that these components explain as much as possible of the covariance between <italic>X</italic> and <italic>Y</italic>. Therefore, PLSR is robust to the noise in comparison to standard linear regression.</p><p>However, PLSR constructs latent variables that not only maximize the correlation of <italic>X</italic> to the response <italic>y</italic>, but also concurrently try to maximize the explained variance in <italic>X</italic>. When the dominant source of variation is not related to <italic>y</italic>, the maximization of the explained <italic>X</italic>-variance is likely to bring irrelevant information into the PLSR model, meaning that the interpretation of PLSR model parameters and variable importance based on these parameters is not a straightforward exercise. The literature largely discusses this issue and multiple approaches have been proposed to tackle the problem (Kvalheim and Karstang, 1989; Kvalheim et al., 2014; Tran et al., 2014).</p><p>Using the property of the basic sequence theory, Tran et al., (2014) developed a method called sMC to statistically assess variable importance in PLSR. The key points in sMC are to estimate for each variable the correct sources of variability resulting from the PLSR (i.e. regression variance and residual variance) and use them to statistically determine a variable's importance with respect to the regression model. In sMC, the F-test values (called sMC F-values) are used to evaluate the predictors' importance in the prognostic model. In the paper by Tran et al., (2014), the performance of sMC was demonstrated on both an omics-related simulated dataset and a real dataset of NIR spectra of pharmaceutical tablets.</p><p>A simulation to test the sMC method:</p><p>Let us return to the above regression example.

Therefore, we suggest that the prognostication model should be interpretable.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>3) It is not clear that excluding patients who died is the right thing to do. At the very least, whether it was the right thing to do should have been discussed. On the one hand, I appreciate that if they died, one can never know if they would have regained consciousness. But in my experience (and I am sure this is the authors' experience too), these patients mostly die for a reason that is related to their initial injury (directly or indirectly). Plus, whether they die or not is of course part and parcel of the prognostication (Can we predict those who die?). I know the paper's intention was to try to predict recovery of consciousness (rather than who died), but I think an argument can be made for including those who died in the 'non recovery of consciousness' group. How does that affect the model? After all, a model that says, &quot;Assuming you live, these data have an 88% chance of predicting whether you will regain consciousness&quot; is nowhere near as good as a model that says, &quot;These data have an 88% chance of predicting whether you will regain consciousness&quot;.</p></disp-quote><p>The reviewer raises an important point. However, if the patients died, we could not assess their CRS-R scores at the end of the follow-up. In this study, the development of the regression model was based on this. In the current situation, as the number of training samples was relatively low, it is difficult to involve those patients who died as the &quot;missing data&quot; in the regression model. On the other hand, we used the present model to test the patients who died. However, we are uncertain whether or not this work makes sense. After all, the present model is developed based on the presence or absence of consciousness recovery. We have acknowledged that mortality is one outcome of DOC, but this study has not involved this aspect. We have added some discussion in the Discussion section of the revised manuscript to address this:</p><p>&quot;Finally, a DOC patient’s prognosis can be considered according to at least three dimensions: survival/mortality, recovery of consciousness, and functional recovery. This study focused on predicting recovery of consciousness, and the patients who died during the follow-up were excluded. In the future, we will consider more outcome assessments, including survival/mortality and functional recovery.&quot;</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>4) Subsection “MRI acquisition”. Supplementary material 1 shows quite a bit of variation in the time after injury at which the MRI was conducted (in the testing dataset alone, the range is 1 month to 77 months). What is noticeable is that almost all those who have a late scan do not recover. On the one hand, this is obvious – if you are still vegetative after 77 months you are very unlikely to recover whether you have a scan or not, and in this sense, the point of trying to 'predict recovery' is less obvious. Plus of course at this point there will have been many brain changes that do not reflect the original injury per se but may be the consequences of languishing in this stage for some years (atrophy, etc.). What would be most interesting would be to see how the model does with patients who, say are scanned within 3 months of their injury. These are the patients that we really care about because if we could prognosticate among them then it could really change clinical practice. To put it simply, including data from a patient who has been in a MCS for 77 months or VS for 54 months and predicting that they will not recover is not adding much (and may be affecting the model), because the chances of any meaningful recovery at that stage is so low anyway.</p></disp-quote><p>Although the range of the times after injury at which the MRI scanning occurred (i.e., the T0 timepoint) was relatively wide (1-77 months), the majority (i.e., 65 out of 112) of the patients were scanned no more than 3 months after the injury, so the median of T0 was equal to or less than 3 months as shown in Table 1 in the manuscript. We emphasize that this is clinically-useful time point and close to the time of injury.</p><p>Notably, our model demonstrated good sensitivity and specificity in both the &quot;subacute&quot; patients (i.e. duration of unconsciousness ≤3 months) and in those in the chronic phase (i.e. duration of unconsciousness &gt;3 months), as shown in Figure 7 of the manuscript.</p><fig id="respfig10"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.36173.052</object-id><label>Author response image 10.</label><caption/><graphic mime-subtype="jpeg" mimetype="image" xlink:href="elife-36173-resp-fig10-v2"/></fig><p>We also found that our model correctly predicted the nine out of ten patients with a DOC duration longer than or equal to three months who subsequently recovered consciousness, including three patients with longer than or equal to six months duration.

The social, economic, and ethical consequences associated with DOC are tremendous. Neurologists are often confronted with the expectations of the prolonged patients' families. Accordingly, several highly impactful functional imaging studies have enrolled the prolonged DOC patients, for example, the patients with 24 years disease duration published in Lancet (Stender et al., 2014), and the ones with 5 years disease duration (Vanhaudenhuyse et al., 2010) or over 25 years disease duration (Demertzi et al., 2015) published in Brain. A recent study published in Brain also enrolled prolonged DOC patients (Chennu et al., 2017).</p><p>A prolonged state of impaired consciousness is devastating. It has been widely considered that a clinically meaningful recovery is unrealistic for prolonged DOC patients (Wijdicks and Cranford, 2005). However, recent pilot studies challenge the existing practice of early treatment discontinuation for these patients, and motivate further research to develop therapeutic interventions, although more validations are required. For example, one study published in Nature reported the use of deep brain stimulation in a MCS patient with 6 years disease duration (Schiff et al., 2007), and another study published in Current Biology reported the use of vagus nerve stimulation in a VS/UWS patient with 15 years disease duration (Corazzol et al., 2017). Recently, we reported the first case of transcutaneous auricular vagus nerve stimulation in DOC (Yu et al., 2017).</p><p>However, before using a novel therapeutic intervention, clinicians first need to determine if the patient is a suitable candidate for these treatments. This requires thorough examination and a review of possible outcomes prior to any intervention. Therefore, an accurate and robust prognostic test for the DOC patient, including a prolonged one, is of significant clinical value. We believe that our study has made important progress in this direction.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>5) fMRI analysis: How were brain lesions taken into account? This could influence the functional connectivity measures considerably.</p></disp-quote><p>According to the clinical characteristics of DOC, this study has carefully taken into account the lesions of the DOC patients during the imaging preprocessing.</p><p>The etiology of DOC can be subdivided into three types, including trauma, stroke and anoxic brain injury. The three causes often have different locations of injury and distinct severities of damage to brain structure and function. For example, for trauma, brain injury is mainly from shear, oppression, and impact, so the DOC patients with trauma could have large or small brain deformation or an incomplete brain. The injury can be relatively limited in a focal region or diffused axonal damage. In stroke, the patient's brain is relatively complete, and the injury location is generally limited to the blood supply area. In anoxia, the brain is always complete, but the injury diffuses through the whole cortex.</p><p>In this study, we checked the T1-weighted 3D high-resolution image for each patient. According to the size of the visible lesion in the T1 image, we divided the lesion into large focal lesions, small focal lesions, and diffused lesions. Large focal lesions often destroy the spatial warping of the ROIs, violate the registration performance and further disrupt the data analysis. Previous studies (Di Perri et al., 2016) used the exclusion criterion that large focal brain damage occupied more than two-thirds of one hemisphere. Our study referred to this criterion and excluded the patient with large focal lesions that exceeded 30% of the total brain volume. In contrast, small focal lesions and diffused lesions should have very limited effects on the registration. ROI-based functional connectivity analysis has been widely used in brain disease studies (Zhang and Raichle, 2010), including DOC studies (Demertzi et al., 2015; Qin et al., 2015; Silva et al., 2015). These brain lesions can not only influence the functional connectivity of the local ROI in which the lesion was located in but also cause the widespread changes throughout the brain (Alstott et al., 2009). Here, we hypothesize that such abnormal manifestations in functional integration from small focal lesions and diffused lesions could be promising markers for the prognosis of DOC patients.</p><p>This study developed protocols to segment the lesion and calculate the volume. Specifically, three authors (MS, YY, and JHH) completed segmentation of the focal lesion and volume calculation. First, using ITK-SNAP and in-house software, the author (MS) segmented the focal lesion in the T1-weighted 3D high-resolution image. YY and JHH, who are both experienced neurosurgeon, then visually checked the segmented lesion slice by slice and modified the boundary if necessary. In this way, focal lesions were extracted from the high-resolution T1 images, and the volume of the lesions was computed. The following figure shows an example (&quot;Beijing_750&quot; dataset, patient alias='013', diagnosis=VS/UWS, GOS=3). The lesion volume within the left brain hemisphere was about 73000ml, 7% of the total brain volume (i.e., the summary of gray matter and white matter).</p><fig id="respfig11"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.36173.053</object-id><label>Author response image 11.</label><caption/><graphic mime-subtype="jpeg" mimetype="image" xlink:href="elife-36173-resp-fig11-v2"/></fig><p>We also developed a toolkit to visually check the transformed ROIs for each patient. More examples are provided in Appendix 5 and Supplementary file 1.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>6) fMRI motion correction (subsection “Imaging preprocessing”): The application of band-pass filtering to &quot;scrubbed&quot; fMRI timeseries is not unproblematic given that the removal of scans from the time series can severely affect temporal autocorrelation. Also, were there significant differences in the number of scrubbed volumes between the outcome groups (for unresponsive patients, movement would seem to be less of an issue than for controls or more responsive patients), and could this have affected regression/classification? Did you consider using scan-nulling regressors as an alternative? (see, for example, the discussion in Caballero-Gaudes and Reynolds, 2017) In SM4, please split the graphs by outcome. If more movement was observed for one subtype of patients, this could drive all the observed results.</p></disp-quote><p>Motion artifact may produce a wide variety of signal changes in the fMRI data, and thus introduce complicated shifts in functional connectivity analysis. This problem is particularly serious for patients with brain diseases, as they are unlikely to follow the experimental instructions well and control their head motion. It is common practice to exclude patients who exhibit excessive head motion, but this would result in only a few patients being enrolled in studies such as ours, and the statistical power could therefore be significantly reduced. Power et al., (2012, 2015) introduced a novel method, called “scrubbing”, that identifies motion-induced spikes in the rsfc-MRI timeseries and excises these data with a temporal mask; adjacent timepoints are then temporally concatenated. Subsequently, Carp (2013) proposed a modification of scrubbing where data were removed and interpolated prior to band-pass filtering in order to avoid propagation of the motion artifact during the application of the band-pass filter. Using simulated data, he demonstrated that this modified scrubbing procedure was able to recover the “ground truth” connectivity in the timeseries (Carp, 2013). This kind of &quot;scrubbing&quot; method has proven one of the most popular approaches for taking the head movement into account, and a great many clinical rs-fMRI studies have adopted the approach, for example, in depression (Drysdale et al., 2017), Parkinson's disease (Mathys et al., 2016), stroke (Adhikari et al., 2017), traumatic brain injury (Dall'Acqua et al., 2017), and the DOC (Qin et al., 2015; Wu et al., 2015). In the paper by Caballero-Gaudes and Reynolds (2017), the authors acknowledged that &quot;scrubbing&quot; is &quot;a popular approach&quot; and proposed it to be &quot;equivalent to adding scan nulling regressors in the model&quot;. Therefore, we used the method here to reduce the motion artifacts of the DOC patients.</p><p>We did not found any significant differences in the number of remaining volumes after scrubbing between the &quot;consciousness recovery&quot; group (GOS≥3) and &quot;consciousness nonrecovery&quot; group (GOS≤2) in either the training dataset or in the two testing datasets (two-sample Kolmogorov-Smirnov test, p=0.21, 0.51, 0.14 in the training dataset &quot;Beijing 750&quot;, the testing dataset &quot;Beijing_HDxt&quot; and &quot;Guangzhou HDxt&quot;, respectively). In addition, we found that there were no significant correlations between the number of remaining volumes and the predicted scores in the training dataset and the two testing datasets (Pearson's correlation, p&gt;0.05). The following figures shows the relationship between the number of remaining volumes and the predicted scores and the predicted imaging subscores in the training dataset. Therefore, we do not think that the number of volumes remaining after scrubbing would significantly affect the regression and classification in our study.</p><fig id="respfig12"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.36173.054</object-id><label>Author response image 12.</label><caption/><graphic mime-subtype="jpeg" mimetype="image" xlink:href="elife-36173-resp-fig12-v2"/></fig><fig id="respfig13"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.36173.055</object-id><label>Author response image 13.</label><caption/><graphic mime-subtype="jpeg" mimetype="image" xlink:href="elife-36173-resp-fig13-v2"/></fig><p>However, in response to the reviewer's suggestion, we have split the graphs in Appendix 4 based on outcome.

When both clinical and imaging features are included it is 88%. Given the rather small size of the sample, this seems to amount to a difference of one patient which is neither here nor there in terms of clinical prognostication. It's not wildly different for the other dataset either. Can you please comment on this? More generally, it seems overstated how much better the combined features did in the model – this would need a critical discussion but also better quantification. In other words, how much more is gained exactly by using both datasets as opposed to either dataset alone? Please report details of the statistical superiority of the combined feature set (p-value, effect size). Also, when you directly compare neuroimaging data and clinical data, is there any difference in how well they support prediction?</p></disp-quote><p>To test whether the combined use of clinical and neuroimaging data is superior to that of any single domain data, we have added some new results to the revised manuscript. We resampled with replacement from the training dataset and built a regression and classification model based on clinical features alone, neuroimaging features alone, or a combination of the two-domain features. We then tested the classification accuracy in the two testing datasets using the three predictive models. In this way, we obtained the distribution of the prediction accuracies using each of the three types of the models. Next, we used repeated measures ANOVA to test whether or not the performances of the three types of models were the same, as well as Ψ, the root-mean-square standardized effect, to report the effect sizes of the mean differences between them. The effect size analysis was carried out using the Matlab toolbox &quot;Measures of Effect Size&quot; (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://github.com/hhentschke/measures-of-effect-size-toolbox">https://github.com/hhentschke/measures-of-effect-size-toolbox</ext-link>).</p><p>1) The &quot;Beijing_HDxt&quot; testing dataset</p><fig id="respfig14"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.36173.056</object-id><label>Author response image 14.</label><caption/><graphic mime-subtype="jpeg" mimetype="image" xlink:href="elife-36173-resp-fig14-v2"/></fig><p>Using repeated measures ANOVA, we found that there were significant differences between the mean of the classification accuracies using the three types of models (p&lt;0.001).

Secondly, the mean differences between the models using neuroimaging features alone or using clinical features alone were reversed in the two testing datasets, which suggested that the two testing datasets were heterogeneous and that it is necessary to integrate different information to improve prognostication for DOC.</p><p>We have provided these statistical results in the subsection &quot;Comparison between single-domain model and combination model”.</p><p>In addition, we have added some discussion in the Discussion section as follows.</p><p>&quot;This study involved two testing datasets, which were found to be quite different, as shown in Table 1. First, the distributions of the etiology of the patients were remarkably different in the two datasets. The numbers of patients suffering from trauma/stroke/anoxia were 12/6/7 and 8/0/16 in the &quot;Beijing HDxt&quot; and &quot;Guangzhou HDxt&quot; datasets, respectively. The outcomes were also different. In the &quot;Beijing HDxt&quot; dataset, 12 out of the total 25 patients recovered consciousness, compared with six out of the total 24 patients in the &quot;Guangzhou HDxt&quot; dataset. Given that the characteristics of the two medical centers and their roles in the local health care system are different, we speculate that this could be one of the main reasons that the enrolled patient populations were heterogeneous. As described in the Introduction, DOC can have many causes and be associated with several neuropathological processes and different severities, leading to the suggestion that information from different domains should be integrated to improve diagnosis and prognostication (Bernat, 2016). Our study demonstrates that the combination of imaging and clinical features can achieve a better performance than the use of single domain features.&quot;</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>8) It is laudable that the code of the statistical model for predictions is made available.

In particular, some of the 'sign-posting' in the article is poor. For example, 'normal controls' are referred to in subsection “Subjects” and subsection “Definition of networks and regions of interest” and so on, but we never really learn much about them until the Results section. This had the unfortunate consequence of making the article feel very vague and lacking important details. They were mostly revealed much later (in the Supplementary material) but better sign posting earlier on would help with that. Likewise, in the Msterials and methods section &quot;The two testing datasets were then used to validate the model&quot;. This comes out of nowhere, and one has no idea what the authors were referring to at this point. Likewise, in the Materials and methods section &quot;All patients were followed up at least 12 months after the T0 time point&quot; sounds vague and under specified. A sign post to Supplementary material 1 would have really helped.</p></disp-quote><p>We have carefully revised the manuscript in light of these comments. (please see Materials and methods section).
