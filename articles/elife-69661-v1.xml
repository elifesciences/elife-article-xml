community-acquired pneumonia (CAP) caused by SARS-CoV-2 (COVID-19) remains clouded by a general lack of relevant disease controls. The scarcity of single-cell investigations in the broader population of patients with CAP renders it difficult to distinguish immune features unique to COVID-19 from the common characteristics of a dysregulated host response to pneumonia. We performed integrated single-cell transcriptomic and proteomic analyses in peripheral blood mononuclear cells from a matched cohort of eight patients with COVID-19, eight patients with CAP caused by Influenza A or other pathogens, and four non-infectious control subjects. Using this balanced, multi-omics approach, we describe shared and diverging transcriptional and phenotypic patterns—including increased levels of type I interferon-stimulated natural killer cells in COVID-19, cytotoxic CD8 T EMRA cells in both COVID-19 and influenza, and distinctive monocyte compositions between all groups—and thereby expand our understanding of the peripheral immune response in different etiologies of pneumonia.</p></abstract><kwd-group kwd-group-type="author-keywords"><kwd>PBMC</kwd><kwd>COVID-19</kwd><kwd>Pneumonia</kwd></kwd-group><kwd-group kwd-group-type="research-organism"><title>Research organism</title><kwd>Human</kwd></kwd-group><funding-group><award-group id="fund1"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100003246</institution-id><institution>NWO</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>16447</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Reijnders</surname><given-names>Tom D Y</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund2"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100000780</institution-id><institution>European Commission</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>847786</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>de Brabander</surname><given-names>Justin</given-names></name><name><surname>van Linge</surname><given-names>Christine</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund3"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100006753</institution-id><institution>AMC</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>Corona Research Fund</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Reijnders</surname><given-names>Tom DY</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><funding-statement>The funders had no role in study design, data collection and interpretation, or the decision to submit the work for publication.</funding-statement></funding-group><custom-meta-group><custom-meta specific-use="meta-only"><meta-name>Author impact statement</meta-name><meta-value>Different etiologies of community-acquired pneumonia evoke both shared and diverging immunological responses.</meta-value></custom-meta></custom-meta-group></article-meta></front><body><sec id="s1" sec-type="intro"><title>Introduction</title><p>The devastating impact of COVID-19 on both a global and interpersonal level is unprecedented in living memory.

The direct comparison of COVID-19 with another, well-matched infectious disease state is urgently needed to distinguish truly specific immune features from the common characteristics of a dysregulated host response to infection.

Written informed consent was obtained from all participants or their legal representatives. In the context of the ELDER-BIOME project, trained research physicians screened patients older than 18 years admitted between October 2018 and June 2020 to the Amsterdam UMC, Flevohospital, or BovenIJ hospital in the Netherlands. Patients were included if they were admitted to the ward and met all of the following criteria: clinical suspicion of an acute infection of the respiratory tract, defined as the presence of at least one respiratory symptom (new cough or sputum production, chest pain, dyspnea, tachypnea, abnormal lung examination, or respiratory failure) and one systemic symptom (documented fever or hypothermia, leukocytosis or leukopenia), and an evident new or progressive infiltrate, consolidation or pleural effusion on chest X-ray or computed tomography scan. Patients were excluded if there was a clinical suspicion of aspiration pneumonia or hospital-associated pneumonia, or if CAP was not the main reason for admission. Patients were excluded from this study if they were severely immunocompromised by either disease or medication. All COVID-19 patients had reverse transcription (RT-PCR)-confirmed SARS-CoV-2 infection, in combination with a CORADS CT-score of 5 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">De Smet et al., 2021</xref>).

PBMCs were separated by density gradient centrifugation using Ficoll-Paque Plus medium (GE Healthcare Life sciences, Little Chalfont, UK) and washed twice, first with cold phosphate-buffered saline (PBS) and then with cold PBS supplemented with 0.5% sterile endotoxin-free bovine serum albumin (BSA) (Divbio Science Europe, Breda, the Netherlands). PBMCs were resuspended in PBS containing 0.5% BSA and 2 mM EDTA and the number of PBMCs was determined using a Coulter Counter (Beckman Coulter, Woerden, the Netherlands). PBMCs were resuspended in Iscove's modified Dulbecco's medium containing 20% filter-sterilized fetal calf serum and pen/strep, after which an equal part of the same medium containing 20% dimethyl sulfoxide was slowly added while continuously stirring and working on ice. 3–5 million PBMCs were viably stored in 1.8 ml cryogenic vials (Corning #430388), which were slowly brought to −80°C.

The sorted cells were incubated with Fc blocker (CD16/CD32, eBioscience) for 10 min, after which each sample was incubated with TotalSeq Hashtag antibody tags to enable multiplexing and subsequent deconvoluting. After Hashtag staining, the cells were pooled into four pools of five samples, each sample contributing equally to their respective pool. The cells were counted manually by light microscopy and Neubauer chambers. Each pooled sample was then incubated for 30 min with our TotalSeq oligo-conjugated antibody panel for later surface protein marker quantification.

Initial objects were created using the function ‘Read10X’. We filtered both objects based on the cell barcode to keep only cells that were identified in both the transcriptome and in the antibody alignments. After this cell filtering, we used the function ‘CreateSeuratObject’ to create a transcriptome-based Seurat object. The antibody-derived data was filtered to maintain only the hashtag counts; later it was appended as a specific assay using the ‘CreateAssayObject’ function. Antibody reads were normalized using the CLR method. For cell demultiplexing, we used the function ‘HTODemux’ with the parameters ‘init=9’, ‘nsamples=10,000’, and ‘positivie quantile’ ranging between 0.999 and 0.9999999 per each sample, in order to maximize the number of singlets detected.

We evaluated proportional differences in cell clusters between groups with the Pearson’s residual of the chi-squared test, in which comparisons with more than two residuals of difference were considered biologically relevant.

While some lymphocyte clusters were relatively decreased, we found a striking proportional increase in a specific T cell cluster and NK cells in patients with COVID-19. This expanded T cell cluster mainly expressed low levels of surface CD27 and variable levels of CD45RA (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1d</xref>), resembling the terminally differentiated effector memory re-expressing CD45RA (EMRA) phenotype as defined by classical flow cytometry (CCR7<sup>−</sup>CD27<sup>−</sup>CD45RA<sup>+</sup>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Martin and Badovinac, 2018</xref>).

Importantly, CAP-flu—but not CAP-other—was associated with a similar CD8 EMRA T cell response, suggesting that this is induced by viral infection in general rather than by SARS-CoV-2 specifically. CD8 EMRA T cells effectively kill virus-infected cells, have a varying proliferation capacity, and (together with CD8 EM T cells) represent the predominant phenotype in circulating CD8 T cells specific for respiratory viruses in adults (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Martin and Badovinac, 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">Schmidt and Varga, 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib44">Verma et al., 2017</xref>).

These T cells may be clonally expanded in moderate, but not severe, disease (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Liao et al., 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib54">Zhang et al., 2020</xref>). Taken together, these findings indicate an important role for cytotoxic T cells with EMRA-like features in controlling the virus both in influenza and COVID-19 pneumonia, although it would be informative to contrast these findings with the T cell response in infections that do not require hospitalization. Similarly, it would be valuable to compare these data with patients that have a more complicated outcome, such as ICU admission, to further separate immunopathology from a homeostatic immune response.</p><p>Whereas T cell lymphopenia has been a ubiquitous finding, the effect of COVID-19 on NK cell numbers is more ambiguous, with cytopenia often limited to the most severe cases (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Kuri-Cervantes et al., 2020b</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Laing et al., 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib50">Wilk et al., 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib54">Zhang et al., 2020</xref>). We report a proportional increase in highly cytotoxic NK cells with a type I interferon transcriptional signature in COVID-19. Patients with CAP-flu—but not with CAP-other—also displayed an expansion of NK cells when compared with non-infectious control subjects, but this was less pronounced when compared directly with COVID-19. While the cytotoxic and interferon-responsive transcriptional features are in line with earlier findings, an expansion of NK cells has not been described in previous COVID-19 single-cell reports (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib50">Wilk et al., 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib54">Zhang et al., 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib56">Zhu et al., 2020</xref>). However, Wilk et al. reported that CD56<sup>dim</sup> NK cells—key in the cytotoxic antiviral response—were maintained in moderate disease, whereas the CD56<sup>bright</sup> NK cells (prone to produce pro-inflammatory cytokines such as IFN-γ) were depleted in both moderate and severe diseases (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib50">Wilk et al., 2020</xref>). COVID-19 has been hypothesized to either induce hyperresponsive NK cells that exacerbate lung-destructive inflammation through the production of IFN-γ; or to hamper effective viral clearance by NK cells, such as through suppressing type I interferon responses and reducing circulating cell numbers (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Market et al., 2020</xref>). In influenza, depletion of NK cells has been implicated only in severe disease, with normal or even increased NK cell counts after mild disease or vaccination (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Fox et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Jost et al., 2011</xref>). While our results partly deviate from previous reports, they could indicate a relatively adequate NK cell response in this population of non-ICU patients with COVID-19 and CAP-flu. Overall, the proportional expansion and activation of CD8 T and NK cells, together with a potent interferon response could be indicative of a homeostatic response to a viral infection. While in this regard it would be of interest to compare patients with different disease outcomes, we deemed the number of patients with a complicated outcome in our cohort too small to justify such an analysis.</p><p>Monocytes are key players in the innate immune response to pathogens and have been reported to respond divergently to different types of RNA viruses (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">de Marcken et al., 2019</xref>). We found striking proportional and transcriptional differences in monocyte subsets between the disease groups: in COVID-19, intermediate monocytes were expanded with a clear antiviral and type I interferon signature, while in CAP-flu, classical monocytes predominated and were characterized by ribosomal translational activity. An enhanced type I interferon response in monocytes of patients with COVID-19 has previously been reported (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Schulte-Schrepping et al., 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib54">Zhang et al., 2020</xref>), but interestingly CAP-flu did not provoke such a strong antiviral response in the expanded monocyte subset. Interferon evasion and hijacking of the host’s ribosomal translational machinery are hallmarks of active viral replication (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Chen et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">García-Sastre, 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib45">Walsh and Mohr, 2011</xref>). While both Influenza and SARS-CoV-2 can infect human monocytes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Hoeve et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Pontelli et al., 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Ren et al., 2021</xref>), the clear transcriptomic difference in our population could indicate that monocytes in patients with CAP-flu—but not COVID-19—harbored intracellular viruses. Furthermore, we found a profound decrease of HLA-DR—which can be indicative of immune suppression—in classical monocytes both in COVID-19 and CAP-flu, when compared with the CAP-other group. Due to our limited sample size, and as decreased expression of HLA-DR is a hallmark of sepsis in patients with CAP, these relatively low levels of HLA-DR in monocytes from patients with viral CAP should be interpreted with caution (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib41">Venet et al., 2020</xref>). In CAP-other, non-classical monocytes preponderated, characterized by enhanced expression of genes involved in MHC-II signaling. This, together with the differential lymphocyte responses discussed above, clearly suggests that the peripheral immune response in CAP depends at least in part on the type of causative pathogen.</p><p>In the NK cells and (to a lesser extent) non-classical monocytes of patients with COVID-19, we found remarkably high expression of interferon-induced transmembrane protein 3 (<italic>IFITM3</italic>). <italic>IFITM3</italic> plays an essential role in restricting viral replication in CAP-flu (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib51">Yánez et al., 2020</xref>), as mice lacking <italic>IFITM3</italic> developed severe pulmonary inflammation when infected with an influenza virus of limited virulence (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Everitt et al., 2012</xref>). Our results underline a potential role of <italic>IFITM3</italic> in COVID-19, although mechanistic evidence will be decisive.</p><p>Strengths of this study include the application of the novel CITE-seq technique, directly integrating proteomic surface marker and transcriptomic data on a single-cell level. This enabled us to readily validate transcriptome-derived clusters and certain disease-related transcriptional patterns at the protein level. Furthermore, the design of this study (in terms of matching and sampling within 48 hr after hospital admission) and the inclusion of disease controls strengthen the observations. Our investigation has several limitations. Experimentally, the total number of analyzed cells was at the lower end of standard practice, which was mainly due to our multiplexed and integrated design. Furthermore, our study had a limited sample size as viable PBMC samples from severity matched, non-COVID-19 CAP patients are scarce. Differences in patient characteristics, such as body mass index and duration of symptoms prior to admission, were largely representative of expected differences between the patient populations (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib49">Wiersinga et al., 2020</xref>). The difference in duration of symptoms prior to hospital admission can be considered a limitation, as time likely influences the composition of immune cell subsets and transcriptional states. We were also unable to take into account the influence of virological features, such as the level of viral load and/or presence of viremia, as these data were not available. The causative organism in CAP is typically only identified in approximately 50% of patients (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Jain et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib48">Welte et al., 2012</xref>). While in this respect our (non-COVID-19) CAP cohort is representative of a general CAP population, patients with CAP-other likely are a more heterogeneous group than patients with pneumonia caused by one pathogen. Finally, one subject in our cohort was co-infected with both Influenza A and <italic>S. pneumoniae.</italic> We nevertheless decided to include this patient to create a realistic representation of patients with CAP-flu, as up to 30% of laboratory-confirmed pneumonia cases can involve viral and bacterial co-infections (most commonly influenza and <italic>S. pneumoniae</italic>) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Gupta et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Jain et al., 2015</xref>).</p><p>Collectively, this investigation provides insight into the peripheral immune features of CAP, including COVID-19, at the single-cell level in patients admitted to a general hospital ward. By contrasting multiple commonly encountered forms of CAP, we provide a framework for the roles of T cells, NK cells, and monocytes in the immunopathophysiology of CAP. This knowledge could guide future mechanistic studies seeking pathogen-specific interventions.</p></sec></body><back><ack id="ack"><title>Acknowledgements</title><p>This work was supported by the Corona Research Fund from the AMC Foundation.

author responses.</p></boxed-text><p><bold>Acceptance summary:</bold></p><p>The authors did a pioneer study comparing single-cell transcriptomic and proteomic signatures from patients with CAP caused by SARS-CoV-2, influenza and other pathogens. While the short number of patients included makes difficult to generalise the results of this study, it has nonetheless a number of major strengths: (1) comparable severity of the three groups; (2) absence of steroidal treatment; (3) the patients are in the first 48 hours following hospitalization at the wards.</p><p><bold>Decision letter after peer review:</bold></p><p>Thank you for submitting your article &quot;Integrated single-cell analysis unveils diverging immune features of COVID-19, influenza and other community-acquired pneumonia&quot; for consideration by <italic>eLife</italic>. Your article has been reviewed by 3 peer reviewers, including Evangelos J Giamarellos-Bourboulis as the Reviewing Editor and Reviewer #2, and the evaluation has been overseen by Jos van der Meer as the Senior Editor. The following individuals involved in review of your submission have agreed to reveal their identity: Jesus Bermejo-Martin (Reviewer #1); Timothy Billiar (Reviewer #3).</p><p>The reviewers have discussed their reviews with one another, and the Reviewing Editor has drafted this to help you prepare a revised submission.</p><p>Essential revisions:</p><p>1. The results support a marked effector T CD8 response along with activated NK and interferon responses in COVID-19 and influenza, which could be expected during an homeostatic response to a viral infection. How do the authors interpret these findings in COVID-19, where a depressed interferon response has been proposed as a signature of severity, at least in some patients? Are the findings here due to the fact that most patients included here resolve the infection? The specific profile of the patient who died could be very informative to this extent.</p><p>2. The more patent depression of HLA-DR in viral CAP compared to CAP of other origin here should be interpreted with caution: depressed expression of HLA-DR is a hallmark of sepsis due to CAP.</p><p>3. We would appreciate to include a table summarising the common/divergent signatures between the three groups of patients.</p><p>4. The authors acknowledge that it would be interesting to compare their results with that obtained in patients with COVID-19 not needing hospitalization. They should also mention that it would be also interesting to compare them with those from a group showing complicated outcomes (ICU admission and death). This limitation makes difficult to elucidate whether the changes described in this work correspond to the process of normal resolution of an infection or otherwise contribute to immunopathology.</p><p>5. Another limitation is the absence of virological data to match them with the immunological findings here: duration of viral shedding, viral load in respiratory samples, presence/absence of viremia….This should also be acknowledged.</p><p>The authors need to change the way they present the results. The readers are interested to head-to-dead comparisons with the other categories of community-acquired pneumonia (CAP) so Figures 4 and 5 should follow Figure 1.</p><p>6. The number of patients are really few; so comparisons should be deleted from Table 1.</p><p>7. What were the causative pathogens in non-flu CAP?</p><p>8. Were PBMCs isolated from critical COVID-19 or just moderate cases? What can be the impact of severity on the three main clusters? Is this clustering associated with outcome and need for dexamethasone treatment?</p><p>9. The discussion is too long. The authors need to condense referral to non-COVID-19 as much as possible.</p><p>10. An integrated view across all the groups with an emphasis of the changes not only in cell specific transcriptional responses, but also at the cell-state level would be of interest.</p><p>11. The authors are encouraged to provide a complete list of the antibodies used in the CITE seq analysis.</p><p>12. Technical information would also be of interest including the cell numbers per sample, the median detected gene numbers (especially in view of the 5' sequencing and access to the full transcriptomic response).</p><p>13. A clear limitation is the possibility that some of the major changes between the group reflect the different durations of infection. This may be especially true for the Covid-19 patients where the duration of symptoms was much longer than the other causes of CAP. This should be listed as a limitation of the study.</p></body></sub-article><sub-article article-type="reply" id="sa2"><front-stub><article-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.69661.sa2</article-id><title-group><article-title>Author response</article-title></title-group></front-stub><body><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Essential revisions:</p><p>1.

We do indeed think that this may be an indication of a relatively well-functioning immune response.</p><p>As for the depressed interferon response to a viral infection, we assume the reviewer is referring to the early paper by Hadjadj and colleagues published in Science, which showed a depressed interferon response in severe (defined as requiring &gt;3L of oxygen) and critically ill patients. Several factors may explain the differences with our study, including methods (bulk RNA-seq vs single-cell) and the fact that our population of ward patients was less severely ill. Furthermore, later studies have also reported heightened interferon response the most severely ill patients. While we share the interest in looking at the interferon response in the patient who died, we think valid inferences cannot be made from the expression profile of a single patient, and therefore prefer not to add this data to the revised manuscript.</p><p>To address these points in the manuscript, we added the following sentence to the discussion (page 23-24, line 508-512):</p><p>“Overall, the proportional expansion and activation of CD8 T and NK cells, together with a potent interferon response could be indicative of a homeostatic response to a viral infection. While in this regard it would be of interest to compare patients with different disease outcomes, we deemed the number of patients with a complicated outcome in our cohort too small to justify such an analysis.”</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>2. The more patent depression of HLA-DR in viral CAP compared to CAP of other origin here should be interpreted with caution: depressed expression of HLA-DR is a hallmark of sepsis due to CAP.</p></disp-quote><p>We fully agree with the reviewer that we cannot draw firm conclusions about the differences in HLA-DR expression between viral and bacterial infections from these data. Decreased HLA-DR expression is indeed a hallmark of immune suppression in sepsis, although it has also been reported in other critically ill patients, such as those with trauma.</p><p>While we have removed our more thorough discussion of this topic to abbreviate the discussion somewhat (in response to comment 9), we have added the following sentence (page 24, line 527- 532) to reflect the reviewer's point:</p><p>“Furthermore, we found profound decrease of HLA-DR – which can be indicative of immune suppression – in classical monocytes both in COVID-19 and CAP-flu, when compared with the CAP-other group. Due to our limited sample size, and as decreased expression of HLA-DR is a hallmark of sepsis in patients with CAP, these relatively low levels of HLA-DR in monocytes from patients with viral CAP should be interpreted with caution.”</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>3. We would appreciate to include a table summarising the common/divergent signatures between the three groups of patients.</p></disp-quote><p>Thank you for this suggestion, we added main table which summarizes the main findings for NK cells, T cells and monocytes (Table 2, page 21).</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>4. The authors acknowledge that it would be interesting to compare their results with that obtained in patients with COVID-19 not needing hospitalization. They should also mention that it would be also interesting to compare them with those from a group showing complicated outcomes (ICU admission and death). This limitation makes difficult to elucidate whether the changes described in this work correspond to the process of normal resolution of an infection or otherwise contribute to immunopathology.</p></disp-quote><p>Indeed, it would be very interesting to compare different levels of disease severity, to separate pathology from homeostatic processes. Unfortunately this was not feasible in the current study, we now added this a limitation in the discussion (page 22-23, line 483-486):</p><p>“Similarly, it would be valuable to compare these data with patients that have a more complicated outcome, such as ICU admission, to further separate immunopathology from a homeostatic immune response.”</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>5. Another limitation is the absence of virological data to match them with the immunological findings here: duration of viral shedding, viral load in respiratory samples, presence / absence of viremia….This should also be acknowledged.</p><p>The authors need to change the way they present the results. The readers are interested to head-to-dead comparisons with the other categories of community-acquired pneumonia (CAP) so Figures 4 and 5 should follow Figure 1.</p></disp-quote><p>Thank you for this important remark. We agree that detailed information regarding the viral load would be a valuable addition to this paper, in particular in relation to the described immune parameters. We added the lacking of such data as a limitation in the discussion (page 25-26, line 558-560):</p><p>“We were also unable to take into account the influence of virological features, such as the level of viral load and/or presence of viremia, as these data were not available.”</p><p>We agree that the comparison between CAP and COVID-19 is the most interesting part of this paper. However, we preferred to structure our manuscript by first comparing COVID-19 and CAP to health (which for CAP has not been reported before), in order to first capture the differences with non-infectious controls, allowing a more logical narrative. In our opinion, this sets the stage for a detailed comparison between the two disease groups, to which we dedicate the final three figures. Therefore we strongly prefer to keep the figures in this order; however, if both the reviewers and the editors feel strongly about changing the order we are of course willing to do so.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>6. The number of patients are really few; so comparisons should be deleted from Table 1.</p></disp-quote><p>We agree that p-values are not very informative with this sample size, and have therefore removed them in line with the reviewer’s suggestion (see revised Table 1 on page 12).</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>7. What were the causative pathogens in non-flu CAP?</p></disp-quote><p>There was one patient in which H. influenzae was cultured in sputum. This is mentioned in the result section (page 11, line 232) and summarized in the Supplementary File 1. The causative pathogen in the other non-flu CAP patients was not identified, as discussed on page 26, line 560 – 563:</p><p>“The causative organism in CAP is typically only identified in approximately 50% of patients. While in this respect our (non-COVID-19) CAP cohort is representative of a general CAP population, patients with CAP-other likely are a more heterogeneous group than patients with a pneumonia caused by one pathogen.”</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>8. Were PBMCs isolated from critical COVID-19 or just moderate cases? What can be the impact of severity on the three main clusters? Is this clustering associated with outcome and need for dexamethasone treatment?</p></disp-quote><p>We agree that disease severity is likely to influence the host response in both patients with CAP and COVID-19. For this reason we intentionally included only patients admitted to the ward and matched the patient groups for disease severity (MEWS score), to make it more likely that differences between groups were due to the disease itself. We therefore do not expect large effects of severity on cell clusters in this cohort, although it would be very interesting to include less/more severely ill patients in future studies (as discussed in comment 4 and the discussion (page 22-23, line 483-486)).</p><p>Cell clusters in this study will not be associated with dexamethasone requirements, as this was not standard of care when these patients were included (none of the patients received dexamethasone; this information is provided on page 11, lines 224-226). We considered the group sizes too small and event rates too low (e.g. only 1 patient died) to say anything meaningful about relation between clusters and clinical outcomes.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>9. The discussion is too long. The authors need to condense referral to non-COVID-19 as much as possible.</p></disp-quote><p>We agree that the discussion featured too much detail that may not add to the main message. In line with this reviewer’s comment, we shortened the discussion significantly (by +- 30%).</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>10. An integrated view across all the groups with an emphasis of the changes not only in cell specific transcriptional responses, but also at the cell-state level would be of interest.</p></disp-quote><p>Indeed, we now included such an overview of cell population differences between the disease groups as main Table 2, which was added in response to point three (Table 2, page 21).</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>11. The authors are encouraged to provide a complete list of the antibodies used in the CITE seq analysis.</p></disp-quote><p>Thank you, this was indeed missing, we added this list to the supplemental information as Supplementary File 2.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>12. Technical information would also be of interest including the cell numbers per sample, the median detected gene numbers (especially in view of the 5' sequencing and access to the full transcriptomic response).</p></disp-quote><p>Thank you for this good suggestion, we now included this data in the manuscript as Supplementary File 3.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>13. A clear limitation is the possibility that some of the major changes between the group reflect the different durations of infection. This may be especially true for the Covid-19 patients where the duration of symptoms was much longer than the other causes of CAP. This should be listed as a limitation of the study.</p></disp-quote><p>We agree that the time since infection will influence the immune features of the groups, as patients might be at a different point of their respective immunological trajectories. However, we initially chose this set-up as to ensure that the patients were matched for disease severity, which we discuss in response to point 8. We added this limitation, the difference in time since infection between groups, to the discussion (page 25, line 556 – 558):</p><p>“The difference in duration of symptoms prior to hospital admission can be a considered a limitation, as time likely influences the composition of immune cell subsets and transcriptional states.”</p></body></sub-article></article>
