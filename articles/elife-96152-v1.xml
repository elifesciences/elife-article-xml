injury. This assumption follows from the hypothesis that olfactory neurogenesis is stochastic with respect to neuron subtype, as defined by the single odorant receptor that each neural precursor stochastically chooses out of hundreds of possibilities. This assumption is challenged, however, by recent findings that the birthrates of a fraction of OSN subtypes are selectively reduced by olfactory deprivation. These findings raise questions about how, and why, olfactory stimuli are required to accelerate the neurogenesis rates of some subtypes, including whether the stimuli are specific (e.g. discrete odorants) or generic (e.g. broadly activating odors or mechanical stimuli). Based on previous findings that the exposure of mice to sex-specific odors can increase the representations of subtypes responsive to those odors, we hypothesized that the neurogenic stimuli comprise discrete odorants that selectively stimulate OSNs of the same subtypes whose birthrates are accelerated. In support of this, we have found, using scRNA-seq and subtype-specific OSN birthdating, that exposure to male and exogenous musk odors can accelerate the birthrates of subtypes responsive to those odors. These findings reveal that certain odor experiences can selectively ‘amplify’ specific OSN subtypes and suggest that persistent OSN neurogenesis serves, in part, an adaptive function.</p></abstract><abstract abstract-type="plain-language-summary"><title>eLife digest</title><p>Wine tasters and perfumers are living proof that repeated exposure to specific scents can make humans more sensitive to them in the long-term. The sense of smell in humans and other mammals relies on millions of odor-sensing neurons, which detect scent molecules inhaled through the nose and send signals to the brain. There are many different ‘subtypes’ of these neurons, each of which detects specific odors.</p><p>The olfactory epithelium, a tissue lining the nasal cavity, produces odor-sensing neurons through a process called neurogenesis. It has long been assumed that this serves only to replace dead neurons and not to enable changes in the neuron population. This is because the subtype of each new neuron is thought to be random, so should be unaffected by exposure to odors. Yet, a more recent study in mice revealed that blocking one nostril reduces how frequently odor-sensing neurons of some subtypes are generated. However, these experiments did not reveal the type of stimuli that influence neurogenesis in the olfactory epithelium.</p><p>To investigate the possibility that these stimuli are specific odors, Hossain et al. exposed mice to odors emitted by male mice or musk odors, which are known to activate specific subtypes of odor-sensing neurons. Genetic and image-based analyses of the olfactory epithelium revealed that this exposure selectively accelerated the generation of neurons that respond to these odors. This suggests that neurogenesis does not just replace ‘lost’ cells but also allows the olfactory epithelium to adapt to scent exposure.</p><p>Hossain et al. hypothesize that this odor-specific neurogenesis could be one mechanism that allows mammals to ‘train’ their noses to be more sensitive to specific scents. In the future, these findings could help to develop treatments that restore the sense of smell in people who have lost sensory neurons.</p></abstract><kwd-group kwd-group-type="author-keywords"><kwd>olfactory sensory neurons</kwd><kwd>neurogenesis</kwd><kwd>regeneration</kwd><kwd>odorant receptors</kwd><kwd>odor stimulation</kwd></kwd-group><kwd-group kwd-group-type="research-organism"><title>Research organism</title><kwd>Mouse</kwd></kwd-group><funding-group><award-group id="fund1"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000055</institution-id><institution>National Institute on Deafness and Other Communication Disorders</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>R01DC019936</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Santoro</surname><given-names>Stephen W</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund2"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000001</institution-id><institution>National Science Foundation</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>1943528</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Santoro</surname><given-names>Stephen W</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><funding-statement>The funders had no role in study design, data collection and interpretation, or the decision to submit the work for publication.</funding-statement></funding-group><custom-meta-group><custom-meta specific-use="meta-only"><meta-name>Author impact statement</meta-name><meta-value>The neurogenesis rates of some olfactory sensory neuron subtypes are selectively accelerated in mice that are exposed to odors that stimulate those subtypes.</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta specific-use="meta-only"><meta-name>publishing-route</meta-name><meta-value>prc</meta-value></custom-meta></custom-meta-group></article-meta></front><body><sec id="s1" sec-type="intro"><title>Introduction</title><p>Mammalian olfactory epithelia (OE) contain hundreds of distinct olfactory sensory neuron (OSN) subtypes, each of which expresses a single odorant receptor (OR) and can thereby be stimulated and/or inhibited by a distinct set of odorant molecules (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Imai, 2022</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib72">Xu et al., 2020</xref>). The olfactory epithelium is one of a few regions of the mammalian nervous system where neurogenesis occurs throughout life (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Brann and Firestein, 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib54">Schwob et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib75">Yu and Wu, 2017</xref>).

By contrast, life-long neurogenesis within the mammalian OE is generally assumed to function solely to replace OSNs that are lost due to normal turnover or environmentally induced damage. This assumption is consistent with the prevailing hypothesis that OSN neurogenesis is strictly stochastic with respect to subtype since it is based on the evidently stochastic process of OR choice (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">McClintock, 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">Monahan and Lomvardas, 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib76">Yusuf and Monahan, 2024</xref>).</p><p>Several studies have observed that the relative quantities of distinct OSN subtypes can be altered by manipulating olfactory experience in mice (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Cadiou et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Cavallin et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Coppola and Waggener, 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Dias and Ressler, 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Fischl et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Ibarra-Soria et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Jones et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib61">van der Linden et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">Morrison et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib48">Santoro and Dulac, 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib70">Watt et al., 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib78">Zhao et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib65">Vihani et al., 2020</xref>). Olfactory deprivation on one side of the OE via unilateral naris occlusion (UNO), for example, has been found to cause both increases and decreases in the representations of different OSN subtypes on the closed side relative to the open (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib48">Santoro and Dulac, 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib78">Zhao et al., 2013</xref>).

Experience-induced changes in the representations of specific OSN subtypes have generally been attributed entirely to altered OSN survival (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Cadiou et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Cavallin et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Jones et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib61">van der Linden et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">Morrison et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib48">Santoro and Dulac, 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib70">Watt et al., 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib78">Zhao et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib65">Vihani et al., 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib46">Ross and Fletcher, 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib77">Zhao and Reed, 2001</xref>), which could theoretically account for both increases and decreases in subtype representations. By contrast, the stochastic nature of OR choice would seem to preclude the contribution of a mechanism involving subtype-selective changes in OSN birthrates.</p><p>Unexplained observations that olfactory deprivation <italic>via</italic> UNO reduces both the overall rate of OSN neurogenesis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Farbman et al., 1988</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Cummings and Brunjes, 1994</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">Mirich and Brunjes, 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib62">van der Linden et al., 2020</xref>) and the representations of a fraction of OSN subtypes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Coppola and Waggener, 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Fischl et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib61">van der Linden et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib48">Santoro and Dulac, 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib78">Zhao et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib62">van der Linden et al., 2020</xref>) motivated a recent study to test the possibility that the birthrates of these subtypes depend on olfactory stimulation. To do so, newborn OSNs of subtypes that exhibit altered representations following UNO were quantified on the open side relative to the closed side of OEs from UNO-treated mice (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib62">van der Linden et al., 2020</xref>). Remarkably, subtypes previously found to have reduced representations on the closed side of the OE also exhibited significantly lower birthrates on the closed side, while subtypes with elevated representations on the closed side showed no differences in birthrates between the two sides. These findings indicated that olfactory stimulation affects the representations of specific OSN subtypes <italic>via</italic> two distinct mechanisms. One mechanism elevates the representations of specific subtypes <italic>via</italic> selective increases in their birthrates. By contrast, a second mechanism reduces the representations of subtypes with extremely high levels of baseline activity, presumably <italic>via</italic> shortened OSN lifespans due to overstimulation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib62">van der Linden et al., 2020</xref>).</p><p>Findings that the birthrates of a fraction of subtypes depend on olfactory stimulation raise several fascinating questions related to the mechanism and function of this phenomenon. One key question concerns the nature of the stimuli that promote neurogenesis. Because naris occlusion reduces exposure to potentially thousands of odors, as well as mechanical stimuli, and likely causes additional physiological changes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Coppola, 2012</xref>), we envisioned that the neurogenic stimuli could be either non-specific with respect to the subtypes that they stimulate (e.g. generic odors, mechanical stimuli, or other physiological effects of UNO) or, alternatively, discrete odorants that selectively stimulate the same OSN subtypes whose birthrates are affected. If the neurogenic stimuli are non-specific, this would imply a generic mechanism and, perhaps, an unknown homeostatic function. By contrast, if the stimuli are discrete odorants that selectively activate the same subtypes whose birthrates are affected, this would imply a highly specific mechanism in which exposure to certain odors can ‘amplify’ subtypes responsive to those odors.</p><p>In this study, we tested the possibility that the neurogenic stimuli comprise discrete odorants. One prediction of this hypothesis is that the extent to which naris occlusion reduces the birthrates of specific subtypes should vary depending on the odor environment to which animals are exposed. Consistent with this, open-side biases in the birthrates of specific subtypes have been found to depend on whether a mouse was in the nursing or post-weaning stage at the time of birthrate assessment (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib62">van der Linden et al., 2020</xref>). A second prediction is that exposure of intact (non-occluded) mice to specific odors should selectively increase the representations of subtypes responsive to those odors. Support for this comes from two separate studies that identified a set of subtypes that were differentially represented within the OEs of male and female mice that were housed in a sex-separated manner until six months (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib61">van der Linden et al., 2018</xref>) or up to 43 weeks of age (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib65">Vihani et al., 2020</xref>), and that these differences were attenuated in mice that were housed sex-combined. Notably, several of these subtypes were found to selectively respond to sex-specific odors (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib61">van der Linden et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib65">Vihani et al., 2020</xref>), indicating that the observed differences were at least partly odor-dependent. As with UNO, the differentially represented subtypes fell into two categories: those for which stimulation increased their representations and those for which stimulation had the opposite effect. OSNs in the former category were exemplified by subtype Olfr235, which exhibited a higher representation in mice exposed to males (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib61">van der Linden et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib65">Vihani et al., 2020</xref>) and selective responsivity to male-emitted odors (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib61">van der Linden et al., 2018</xref>), and was previously shown to respond to musk odors (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">McClintock et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib51">Sato-Akuhara et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib55">Shirasu et al., 2014</xref>), whose emission by mice has not been documented. In analogy to findings from UNO-based studies (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib62">van der Linden et al., 2020</xref>), we speculated that these subtypes undergo sex-specific odor-dependent selective birthrate acceleration. Here, we present evidence that the neurogenesis rates of Olfr235 and other musk-responsive OSN subtypes are increased in mice exposed to male-specific and musk odors. These findings support the hypothesis that discrete odors can selectively accelerate the birthrates of OSN subtypes that they stimulate and suggest that the function of persistent OSN neurogenesis is not limited to the replacement of neurons lost through damage or normal turnover, but may also enable adaptive changes to the subtype composition of the OSN population.</p></sec><sec id="s2" sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><sec id="s2-1"><title>Long-term exposure of mice to male odors is associated with increased representations of musk-responsive OSN subtypes</title><p>To test the possibility that discrete odorants can selectively accelerate the birthrates of the OSN subtypes that they stimulate, we sought to identify subtypes that exhibit odor exposure-dependent increases in representations and for which stimulating odors have been identified. A challenge of this approach is that odorant ligands remain unidentified for most OSN subtypes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib42">Peterlin et al., 2014</xref>). To overcome this, we speculated that candidate subtypes might be identified among those previously found to be more highly represented in mice exposed to odors emitted specifically by male or female mice (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib61">van der Linden et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib65">Vihani et al., 2020</xref>). OSN subtypes in this category, which include Olfr235, were observed to be more highly represented in mice exposed to male conspecifics (sex-separated males; sex-combined males and females) compared to mice isolated from males (sex-separated females; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib61">van der Linden et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib65">Vihani et al., 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="app1fig1">Appendix 1—figure 1</xref>). These findings, combined with observations that Olfr235 OSNs show selective responsivity to male odors (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib61">van der Linden et al., 2018</xref>), suggest that the exposure of mice to one or more odor components specific to males causes an increase in the representation of subtype Olfr235 within the OSN population. Interestingly, Olfr235, which expresses the OR-encoding gene <italic>Or5an11</italic>, belongs to a group of subtypes that express homologous ORs and respond to different musk odorants with varying levels of sensitivity and selectivity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">McClintock et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib51">Sato-Akuhara et al., 2016</xref>). Notably, like Olfr235, other subtypes within this group, which includes Olfr1440 (<italic>Or5an6</italic>), Olfr1437 (<italic>Or5an1b</italic>), Olfr1431 (<italic>Or5an9</italic>), and Olfr1434 (<italic>Or5an1</italic>), exhibited higher transcript levels in the OEs of mice exposed to male odors compared to their unexposed counterparts (except subtype Olfr1434, whose transcript levels were too low to be accurately assessed; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib61">van der Linden et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="app1fig1">Appendix 1—figure 1</xref>). Accordingly, RNA-fluorescent in situ hybridization (RNA-FISH) analyses of a subset of these ORs, Olfr235 and Olfr1437, confirmed that the elevated transcript levels observed in mice exposed to male odors reflected greater representations of these subtypes within the OSN population (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib61">van der Linden et al., 2018</xref>). By contrast, subtypes Olfr912 (<italic>Or8b48</italic>) and Olfr1295 (<italic>Or4k45</italic>), which detect the male-specific non-musk odorants 2-(sec-Butyl)–4,5-dihydrothiazole (SBT) and (methylthio)methanethiol (MTMT), respectively (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib65">Vihani et al., 2020</xref>), exhibited lower representations and/or transcript levels in mice exposed to male odors (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib61">van der Linden et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib65">Vihani et al., 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="app1fig1">Appendix 1—figure 1</xref>), possibly reflecting reduced survival due to overstimulation. Taken together, these findings indicate that OSN subtypes that are responsive to musk odors are selectively increased in their representations upon long-term exposure to male mice, consistent with the hypothesis that components of male odors selectively accelerate the birthrates of these subtypes.</p></sec><sec id="s2-2"><title>Olfactory deprivation via UNO reduces quantities of newborn OSNs of musk-responsive subtypes in male mice</title><p>If the birthrates of musk-responsive OSN subtypes are accelerated by exposure to male odors, quantities of newborn OSNs of these subtypes would be expected to be reduced following olfactory deprivation in male mice.

Remarkably, musk-responsive OSN subtypes exhibited, on average, 3.1-fold greater quantities of newborn OSNs within the open-sides of the OEs compared to the closed, with all subtypes except Olfr1437 showing open-side biases (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1D and E</xref>-<italic>left</italic>; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1C–E</xref>). By contrast, newborn OSNs of 15 randomly chosen subtypes located within approximately the same region of the OE where musk-responsive subtypes reside (canonical zones 2 and 3; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib60">Tan and Xie, 2018</xref>) comprise, on average, nearly equal quantities within the open and closed sides (1.07-fold difference; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1E</xref>-<italic>right</italic>). To verify that the differences in newborn OSN quantities are not due to aberrant OR expression regulation (e.g. co-expression of multiple ORs), we analyzed cell-specific OR expression at three stages of OSN differentiation: immediate neuronal precursor 3 (INP3), immature OSN (iOSN), and mature OSN (mOSN; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s2">Figure 1—figure supplement 2</xref>).

The EdU injection timepoint was based on the timepoint used for identification of immature (<italic>Gap43</italic>-expressing) OSNs in the scRNA-seq datasets, while the dissection timepoint was chosen to provide a chase period of 7 days, which is sufficient to enable robust and stable expression of an OR (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib62">van der Linden et al., 2020</xref>). In agreement with findings from scRNA-seq, EdU-labeled OSNs of subtypes Olfr235, Olfr1440, and Olfr1431 exhibited significantly greater quantities on the open side of the OE compared to the closed side in adolescent male mice (p&lt;0.05; 2.3-fold, 1.8-fold, and 2.5-fold, respectively) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2C–F</xref>).

If so, the exposure of non-occluded mice to male odors should increase observed quantities of newborn Olfr235 OSNs. To test this, we compared quantities of newborn Olfr235 OSNs in non-occluded sex-separated females, sex-separated males, and sex-combined females (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3A and B</xref>). Remarkably, compared to sex-separated females, sex-separated males and sex-combined females exhibited significantly greater quantities of newborn Olfr235 OSNs (p&lt;0.01; 2.2-fold and 3.1-fold, respectively; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3G</xref>). By contrast, quantities of newborn OSNs of the SBT-responsive subtype Olfr912 showed no significant differences between the three experimental groups (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3H</xref>). These findings strongly support the conclusion that the exposure of mice to male odors increases quantities of newborn Olfr235 OSNs within the OE.</p><p>Unlike subtype Olfr235<italic>,</italic> subtypes Olfr1440 and Olfr1431 exhibited significant open-side biases in both newborn and total OSN quantities within the OEs of UNO-treated sex-separated males, sex-separated females, and sex-combined females (p&lt;0.05), with no significant differences in UNO effect size observed between the three groups (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s1">Figure 3—figure supplement 1C–F</xref>). As expected, the non-musk-responsive OSN subtypes Olfr912 and Olfr1463 exhibited no significant open-side biases in newborn OSN quantities in any experimental group, although Olfr912 showed significant closed-side biases in total OSNs (p&lt;0.01; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s1">Figure 3—figure supplement 1G–J</xref>), consistent with the possibility that naris occlusion protects OSNs of this subtype from overstimulation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib61">van der Linden et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib65">Vihani et al., 2020</xref>). Observations that exposure to male odors is required for occlusion-induced reductions in quantities of newborn OSNs of subtypes Olfr235 but not Olfr1440 or Olfr1431 were unexpected considering that ORs of all three subtypes show male-biased expression in mice housed sex-separated until 6 months of age (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="app1fig1">Appendix 1—figure 1</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib61">van der Linden et al., 2018</xref>). A conceivable explanation for these findings is that, unlike subtype Olfr235, quantities of newborn Olfr1440 and Olfr1431 OSNs are elevated by exposure to odors emitted by both male and female mice at the adolescent stage. Such differences could reflect variations in the specific odorants to which distinct musk-responsive subtypes are most sensitive (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib51">Sato-Akuhara et al., 2016</xref>), and which may depend on the age and sex of mice contributing to the odor environment (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib41">Osada et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib40">Osada et al., 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib53">Schwende et al., 1986</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib57">Stopková et al., 2023</xref>). If so, we predicted that the age and/or sex of mice within the odor environment at the time of EdU labeling might differentially affect the degree to which quantities of newborn OSNs of these subtypes are affected by olfactory deprivation. To test this, we compared open-side biases in newborn OSN quantities within UNO-treated adolescent males exposed to littermates alone versus those exposed to both littermates and adult parents (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s3">Figure 3—figure supplement 3A, B</xref>). Remarkably, newborn Olfr1431 OSNs exhibited a significantly greater (p&lt;0.05; 2-fold) UNO effect size in the presence of adult mice compared to the absence, reflecting open-side biases of 4.8-fold and 2.5-fold, respectively (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s3">Figure 3—figure supplement 3C, D</xref>). By contrast, UNO effect sizes for newborn OSNs of subtypes Olfr235, Olfr1440, and Olfr1437, as well as the control subtype Olfr912<italic>,</italic> were not significantly affected by exposure to adults (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s3">Figure 3—figure supplement 3E–I</xref>). These findings are consistent with the possibility that stimulation-dependent changes in the quantities of newborn OSNs of musk-responsive subtypes may vary depending on the age of odor-emitting mice within the environment.</p></sec><sec id="s2-4"><title>The exposure of UNO-treated mice to low concentrations of a musk odorant increases open-side biases in quantities of newborn OSNs of musk-responsive subtypes</title><p>Evidence that quantities of newborn OSNs of musk-responsive subtypes can be affected by exposure to unknown components of mouse odors indicated that the birthrates of specific OSN subtypes may be accelerated by discrete odorants. If so, we predicted that the exposure of mice to musk odorants that are known to stimulate these subtypes would increase their neurogenesis rates. However, because high levels of chronic stimulation of OSNs have been found to reduce the representations of stimulated subtypes within the OSN population, presumably <italic>via</italic> reductions in OSN lifespan (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Cadiou et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Cavallin et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib61">van der Linden et al., 2018</xref>), we speculated that there may be a range of odorant concentrations sufficient to accelerate the birthrates of these subtypes without shortening their OSN lifespans. To assess this, we analyzed the effects of exposing UNO-treated female mice to varying concentrations of the musk odorant (<italic>R</italic>)–3-methylcyclopentadecanone (muscone) on quantities of newborn and total OSNs of the musk-responsive subtypes Olfr235, Olfr1440, and Olfr1431, as well as the control subtypes Olfr912 and Olfr1463, via a metal tea-ball from weaning (PD 21) until dissection (PD 35; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4A and B</xref>). Remarkably, exposure of mice to muscone was found to significantly affect the extent to which UNO treatment alters the relative quantities of both newborn and total OSNs of musk-responsive subtypes on the open and closed sides of the OE in a concentration-dependent manner (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4C</xref>; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s1">Figure 4—figure supplements 1</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s2">2</xref>). Subtype Olfr235, for example, which showed no significant difference in newborn OSN quantities between the open and closed sides in unexposed females, exhibited significant open-side biases in females exposed to 0.1% or 1% muscone (p&lt;0.01; 2.4 and 2.0-fold, respectively), but not those exposed to 10% (1.2-fold; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4C</xref>-<italic>middle</italic>). Accordingly, mice exposed to 0.1% or 1% muscone exhibited significantly greater UNO effect sizes for quantities of newborn Olfr235 OSNs compared to unexposed females (p&lt;0.05; 14 and 13-fold, respectively; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4C</xref>-<italic>right</italic>). Similarly, open-side biases in total Olfr235 OSNs were observed in mice exposed to 0.1% or 1% muscone, with the most significant effect observed at 0.1% (p&lt;0.01; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s2">Figure 4—figure supplement 2</xref>). One possible explanation for the reduction in UNO effect sizes observed at 10% muscone relative to lower concentrations is that small amounts of odorant may enter the closed side of the OE due to transnasal and/or retronasal odor transfer via the nasopharyngeal canal (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Kelemen, 1947</xref>) and nasopharynx, respectively (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Coppola, 2012</xref>), an effect that would be expected to increase with environmental concentrations and attenuate differences in observed effects of odor stimulation between the open and closed sides.</p><fig-group><fig id="fig4" position="float"><label>Figure 4.</label><caption><title>Exposure of mice to musk odors causes selective increases in quantities of newborn OSNs of musk-responsive subtypes.</title><p>(<bold>A</bold>, <bold>B</bold>) Experimental timeline (<bold>A</bold>) and conditions (<bold>B</bold>) used to generate OE tissue samples for assessing the effects of exposure to musk (muscone, ambretone) or non-musk (SBT, IAA) odorants on quantities of newborn OSNs of specific subtypes.

We speculate that this may be explained in part by the fact that both subtypes exhibit significant open-side biases in UNO-treated female mice even in the absence of exogenous odor exposure, which may limit the influence of muscone exposure on the UNO effect size. In the case of Olfr1440, the subtype most sensitive to muscone (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib51">Sato-Akuhara et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib55">Shirasu et al., 2014</xref>), it is conceivable that mature OSNs are robustly stimulated on the closed side of the OE by very small amounts of odors that enter transnasally and/or retronasally. Consistent with this possibility, UNO-treated females exposed to 0.1% muscone show greater quantities of newborn Olfr1440 OSNs on both the open and closed sides of the OE compared to their unexposed counterparts (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s1">Figure 4—figure supplement 1A-middle</xref>).

In the case of Olfr1431, newborn OSNs exhibited a significantly greater open-side bias in mice exposed to 1% muscone compared to unexposed controls (p&lt;0.01; 1.6-fold), but no significant difference at 0.1%, perhaps indicating that this subtype is less sensitive to muscone than other subtypes. Like subtype Olfr235, neither Olfr1440 nor Olfr1431 exhibited significant open-side biases in newborn OSN quantities in mice exposed to 10% muscone, potentially reflecting substantial transnasal and/or retronasal odor transfer to the closed side of the OE at this concentration.

Interestingly, mouse preputial glands have been found to have a high degree of histomorphological, transcriptomic, and molecular similarities to muskrat scent glands (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Han et al., 2022</xref>), which secrete musk odors (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">Mookherjee and Wilson, 2012</xref>). Moreover, a previous study noted preliminary evidence that mouse preputial gland extracts contain compounds that activate Olfr1440 OSNs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib51">Sato-Akuhara et al., 2016</xref>). Based on this information, we analyzed mouse preputial gland extracts <italic>via</italic> gas chromatography – mass spectrometry (GC-MS) for known musk molecules, particularly those shown to stimulate Olfr235 and Olfr1440 OSNs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib51">Sato-Akuhara et al., 2016</xref>). Intriguingly, these analyses revealed the presence of molecules whose GC-MS signals are structurally consistent with known musk molecules (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="app1fig2">Appendix 1—figure 2</xref>). A potential match to one such signal is cycloheptadecanol, a musk molecule that is structurally similar to those known to activate Olfr235 and Olfr1440 OSNs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib51">Sato-Akuhara et al., 2016</xref>). Verification of the presence of this and other musk-like odors that correspond to signals from mouse preputial glands will require comparisons to pure standards. Notably, the approach employed here was solely focused on the preputial gland and known musk molecules. However, it is conceivable that mouse musk-responsive OSNs are naturally stimulated by molecules that are structurally unrelated to those that have been characterized to date or are emitted from sources other than preputial glands. Future studies will be needed to address these possibilities.</p></sec></sec><sec id="s3" sec-type="discussion"><title>Discussion</title><sec id="s3-1"><title>The exposure of mice to discrete odorants can selectively accelerate the birthrates of OSN subtypes that they stimulate</title><p>Previous studies have established that UNO reduces the overall rate of neurogenesis on the closed side of the OE relative to the open (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Farbman et al., 1988</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Cummings and Brunjes, 1994</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">Mirich and Brunjes, 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib58">Suh et al., 2006</xref>). Recently, these occlusion-induced reductions were found to reflect decelerations of the birthrates of only a fraction of the ~1200 OSN subtypes and to vary according to age and/or the olfactory environment (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib62">van der Linden et al., 2020</xref>), suggesting the possibility that unknown olfactory stimuli selectively promote the birthrates of these subtypes. In this study, we aimed to test this by elucidating the nature of stimuli that accelerate the birthrates of specific OSN subtypes. We have presented findings that these stimuli include discrete odorants that selectively activate the same subtypes whose birthrates are accelerated. These findings build upon previous observations that a small group of musk-responsive OSN subtypes are more highly represented in the OEs of mice exposed to male odors compared to mice isolated from them (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib61">van der Linden et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib65">Vihani et al., 2020</xref>), and that some of these subtypes are also responsive to male-specific odors (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib61">van der Linden et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="app1fig1">Appendix 1—figure 1</xref>). These data suggested that one or more components of mouse-emitted odors might naturally accelerate the birthrates of these OSN subtypes. Here, using scRNA-seq-based and histological approaches, we have found that UNO treatment of adolescent male mice reduces quantities of newborn OSNs of musk-responsive subtypes on the closed side of the OE relative to the open, consistent with the possibility that these subtypes have a capacity to undergo stimulation-dependent neurogenesis (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figures 1</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">2</xref>). Additionally, we have presented findings that the exposure of mice to male-specific odors or two different exogenous musk odorants can selectively elevate quantities of newborn OSNs of musk-responsive subtypes (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figures 3</xref>—<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">5</xref>). Finally, we have described evidence that odor-driven increases in newborn OSN quantities are stable over time after EdU labeling, indicating that the observed changes reflect altered OSN birthrates as opposed to altered OSN lifespan or OR gene switching (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6</xref>). Collectively, these findings support the hypothesis that the stimuli that regulate the birthrates of specific subtypes are discrete odors that selectively stimulate those subtypes.</p></sec><sec id="s3-2"><title>How do discrete odors accelerate the birthrates of specific OSN subtypes?</title><p>Our findings that specific OSN subtypes exhibit accelerated birthrates following the exposure of mice to odors that selectively stimulate OSNs of these subtypes indicate that this process occurs via a mechanism that is highly specific with respect to the stimulating odors and the subtypes whose birthrates are accelerated. Considering that horizontal basal cells (HBCs) and globose basal cells (GBCs), the stem and progenitor cells that give rise to new OSNs, lack ORs and signal transduction molecules needed to detect and respond to odors, we hypothesize the existence of a signaling pathway from mature OSNs to HBCs or GBCs that alters the rates at which OSNs of specific subtypes are born. Findings from the present study and a previous one (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib62">van der Linden et al., 2020</xref>) indicate that this signaling capacity may be limited to only a fraction of OSN subtypes, since a majority of subtypes do not appear to exhibit stimulation-dependent neurogenesis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib62">van der Linden et al., 2020</xref>). Subtype Olfr912, for example, which detects the male-specific odor component SBT (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib65">Vihani et al., 2020</xref>), exhibits no increase in birthrate upon exposure of female mice to male odors and was therefore employed in this study as a control subtype. We speculate that the receipt of odor-derived signals by HBCs or GBCs alters OR choices or amplifies choices that have already been made. Elucidating the nature of odor-dependent signals received by HBCs/GBCs and the mechanism by which these signals accelerate the birthrates of specific OSN subtypes are important areas of future investigation.</p></sec><sec id="s3-3"><title>What functions does discrete odor stimulation-dependent neurogenesis of specific OSN subtypes serve?</title><p>Because OSN differentiation entails the stochastic process of singular OR choice (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">McClintock, 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">Monahan and Lomvardas, 2015</xref>), it has long been assumed that OSN neurogenesis is entirely stochastic with respect to OR identity. Thus, unlike other regions of the nervous system where persistent neurogenesis is known to play important adaptive roles (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Lledo and Valley, 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Ming and Song, 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">Opendak and Gould, 2015</xref>), life-long neurogenesis within the OE is generally assumed to serve the merely homeostatic function of replacing neurons lost to turnover and injury (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib75">Yu and Wu, 2017</xref>). Results of the present study, together with those of a previous one (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib62">van der Linden et al., 2020</xref>), challenge these assumptions by demonstrating that neurogenesis is not entirely stochastic with respect to subtype, but rather that the birthrates of a fraction of OSN subtypes can be selectively and directionally regulated by discrete odor experiences (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7</xref>). These findings suggest the possibility that persistent neurogenesis within the OE serves an unknown adaptive function in addition to the known homeostatic one. It is conceivable, for example, that the acceleration of the birthrates of specific OSN subtypes could selectively enhance sensitivity to odors detected by those subtypes by increasing their representations within the OE (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib63">van Drongelen et al., 1978</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">Meisami, 1989</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">D’Hulst et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Apfelbach et al., 1991</xref>). Under this scenario, OSNs of affected subtypes might have baseline representations that lie within the dynamic range for signaling to projection neurons under physiological concentrations of cognate odors, such that accelerated neurogenesis could enhance an animal’s sensitivity to odors detected by these subtypes. This effect could have relevance to intriguing and unexplained observations in both rodents and humans that exposure to specific odors can dramatically increase sensitivity to them (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib67">Wang et al., 1993</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib74">Yee and Wysocki, 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Dalton et al., 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib66">Voznessenskaya et al., 1995</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib68">Wang et al., 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib71">Wysocki et al., 1989</xref>). Alternatively, or in addition, OSNs produced via odor-dependent neurogenesis could conceivably enable the formation of new OB glomeruli and synaptic connections with projection neurons (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib79">Zou et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib73">Yamada et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Dorrego-Rivas and Grubb, 2022</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib44">Qiu et al., 2021</xref>).

For some mammals, musk odors are known to function in attracting mates, marking territory, and deterring predators (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">Mookherjee and Wilson, 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Agosta, 1992</xref>). Moreover, exposure to musk odors has been reported to cause physiological changes in some mammals, including humans, suggesting that they can function as semiochemicals (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Fukui et al., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Kato et al., 2004</xref>). In mice, the physiological functions of musk odors, if any, are unknown, although they have been found to be selectively attractive to male mice (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Horio et al., 2019</xref>). Previous findings that exogenous musk odors activate a small number of related and evolutionarily conserved mouse ORs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">McClintock et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib51">Sato-Akuhara et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib55">Shirasu et al., 2014</xref>) and that odors emitted selectively by male mice activate OSN subtypes that express a subset of these ORs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib61">van der Linden et al., 2018</xref>) suggest the possibility that mice also emit musk-like molecules. Our preliminary findings that mouse preputial gland extracts contain molecules that are structurally related to known musk odors provide additional support for this possibility.</p><p>Our findings that the exposure of mice to odors from adolescent males, but not females, accelerates the birthrate of Olfr235 OSNs provide a mechanistic explanation for previous observations that mice exposed to male odors exhibit higher representations of this subtype (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib61">van der Linden et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib65">Vihani et al., 2020</xref>). Curiously, two other musk-responsive subtypes that displayed a higher representation in males and females housed with males, Olfr1440 and Olfr1431 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib61">van der Linden et al., 2018</xref>), showed stimulation-dependent changes in newborn OSN quantities in both adolescent male and female mice, while a third such subtype, Olfr1437, exhibited no occlusion-mediated changes in quantities of newborn OSNs in adolescent mice of either sex (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figures 1</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">2</xref>, and data not shown). Considering the close relationship of the ORs that define musk-responsive OSN subtypes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">McClintock et al., 2014</xref>), these differences are intriguing. One conceivable explanation is that musk-responsive OSN subtypes vary in their sensitivity to distinct musk-like odorant molecules (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib51">Sato-Akuhara et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Horio et al., 2019</xref>), which may be differentially emitted by mice in an age- and sex-dependent manner. Indeed, mouse odor profiles are known to vary considerably as a function of age and sex (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib41">Osada et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib40">Osada et al., 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib53">Schwende et al., 1986</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib57">Stopková et al., 2023</xref>). In support of this, we have found that the exposure of adolescent mice to adults selectively intensifies UNO-induced open-side biases in quantities of newborn Olfr1431 OSNs. A more complete understanding of the role of odor-stimulation-dependent neurogenesis in altering the representations of distinct musk-responsive subtypes in the mouse OE will require determining the identities and sources of the natural ligands that stimulate these subtypes and how exposure to these odorants affects OSN birthrates. Future studies will also be needed to determine the mechanism that endows musk-responsive subtypes, as well as a fraction of other subtypes whose ligands have yet to be identified (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib62">van der Linden et al., 2020</xref>), with the capacity to undergo stimulation-dependent neurogenesis, and whether these subtypes detect odors with special functional

This approach has been used in multiple previous studies for quantifying newborn (OR+/EdU+) and total (OR+) OSN abundances (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Ibarra-Soria et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib61">van der Linden et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib62">van der Linden et al., 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Hossain et al., 2023</xref>). To verify the rigor of this method, newborn Olfr235 OSN quantities were also normalized by total quantities of newborn OSNs (approximated by total EdU+ cells) or total quantities of cells (approximated by DAPI+ area) for three experimental comparisons in this study: the open versus the closed sides of OEs from UNO-treated male mice (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s2">Figure 2—figure supplement 2</xref>), OEs from non-occluded females versus males (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s2">Figure 3—figure supplement 2</xref>), and OEs from non-occluded females exposed just to female littermates versus females also exposed to 0.1% muscone (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s4">Figure 4—figure supplement 4</xref>).

Of the 274 datasets tested, 253 have Shapiro-Wilk p-values &gt;0.05, indicating that the vast majority (92%) do not show evidence of significant deviation from a normal distribution. A general lack of deviation of the datasets in this study from a normal distribution is further supported by quantile-quantile (QQ) plots (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="app1fig3">Appendix 1—figure 3</xref>). Moreover, results of both parametric and non-parametric statistical tests of comparisons in this study are, in general, in good agreement (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="supp3">Supplementary file 3</xref>). Statistical analyses of differences in OSN quantities between the open and closed sides of OEs from UNO-treated mice were performed using ratio paired two-tailed <italic>t</italic>-tests (parametric) and Wilcoxon matched-pairs signed rank two-tailed tests (non-parametric). For these tests, the open and closed sides of each OE were paired, enabling testing of differences between the two sides independent of OSN number and staining variance between sections. Statistical analyses of differences in OSN quantities in the OEs of non-occluded mice or UNO effect sizes in UNO-treated mice subjected to two different experimental conditions were performed using unpaired two-tailed <italic>t</italic>-tests (parametric) and Mann-Whitney two-tailed tests (non-parametric). Statistical analyses of differences in OSN quantities in the OEs of non-occluded mice or UNO effect sizes in UNO-treated mice subjected to more than two different experimental conditions were performed using one-way ANOVA tests, FDR-adjusted using the two-stage linear step-up procedure of Benjamini, Krieger and Yekutieli (parametric) and Kruskal-Wallis tests, FDR-adjusted using the two-stage linear step-up procedure of Benjamini, Krieger and Yekutieli (non-parametric). For comparisons of differences in quantities of newborn OSNs of musk-responsive subtypes at 4 and 7 days post-EdU between non-occluded mice exposed and unexposed to muscone, a two-sample ANOVA - fixed-test, using F distribution (right-tailed) was used.

OSNs are born throughout life and thus represent one of the few neurons that undergo life-long neurogenesis. Until recently, it was assumed that OSN neurogenesis is strictly stochastic with respect to subtype (i.e. the receptor the OSN chooses to express). However, a recent study showed that olfactory deprivation via naris occlusion selectively reduced birthrates of only a fraction of OSN subtypes and indicated that these subtypes appear to have a special capacity to undergo changes in birthrates in accordance with the level of olfactory stimulation. These previous findings raised the interesting question of what type of stimulation influences neurogenesis, since naris occlusion does not only reduce the exposure to potentially thousands of odors, but also to more generalized mechanical stimuli via preventing airflow.</p><p>In this study, the authors set out to identify the stimuli that are required to promote the neurogenesis of specific OSN subtypes. Specifically, they aim to test the hypothesis if discrete odorants selectively stimulate the same OSN subtypes whose birthrates are affected. This would imply a highly specific mechanism in which exposure to certain odors can &quot;amplify&quot; OSN subtypes responsive to those odors suggesting that OE neurogenesis serves, in part, an adaptive function.</p><p>To address this question, the authors focused on a family of OSN subtypes that had previously been identified to respond to musk-related odors and that exhibit higher transcript levels in the olfactory epithelium of mice exposed to males compared to mice isolated from males. First, the authors confirm via a previously established cell birth dating assay in unilateral naris occluded mice that this increase in transcript levels actually reflects a stimulus-dependent birthrate acceleration of this OSN subtype family. In a series of experiments (in unilateral occluded and non-occluded mice) using the same birth dating assay, they show that several subtypes of this OSN family, but not other &quot;control&quot; subtypes exhibit increased birthrates in response to adolescent male exposure, but not to female exposure.</p><p>In the core experiment of the study, they expose unilaterally naris occluded and non-occluded mice to two musk-related odors and two &quot;control&quot; odors (that do not activate musk-responsive OSN subtypes) to test if these odors specifically accelerate the birth rates of OSN types that are responsive to these odors. This experiment reveals that (for the tested odors and OSN subtypes) indeed birthrates are only affected by discrete odorants that stimulate these OSN subtypes (with a complex relationship between birth rate acceleration and odor concentrations) suggesting that OE neurogenesis may serve, in part, as an adaptive function</p><p>Strength:</p><p>The scientific question is valid and opens an interesting direction. The previously established cell birth dating assay in naris occluded and non-occluded mice is well performed and accompanied by several control experiments addressing potential other interpretations of the data.</p><p>In this revised version, the authors added several new experiments addressing the previous concern that only the effect of one specific odor (muscone) on musk-responsive OSN subtypes had been tested to make the general claim that discrete odors specifically accelerate the birth rate of OSN subtypes they stimulate. Now the authors demonstrate that another musk-related odor (ambretone) also induces this effect and that other non-musk odors do not. In addition, they show that two other OSN subtypes that do not respond to musk-related odors are not affected. These experiments further substantiate the above claim.</p><p>Weakness:</p><p>(1) The main research question of this study was to test if discrete odors specifically accelerate the birth rate of OSN subtypes they stimulate, i.e. does muscone only accelerate the birth rate of OSNs that express muscone-responsive ORs, or vice versa is the birthrate of muscone-responsive OSNs only accelerated by odors they respond to?</p><p>As mentioned under &quot;strength&quot; the authors added several experiments to further substantiate their claim. While these controls are very important to show that the observed effect is indeed specific for musk-related odors on musk-responsive OSN subtypes, these experiments still only focus on one closely related family of musk-responsive OSN subtypes. To understand if this phenomenon is a more generalized mechanism and plays a role for other OSN subtypes beyond this small family of related receptors, further experiments showing this effect for other OSN subtypes are critical.</p><p>(2) Previous concerns (#2, #4, #5 and #6) about a lack of increase in UNO effect size for olfr1440 under any muscone concentrations, strong fluctuations of newborn neurons on the closed side as well as a seemingly contradicting statement that overstimulation possibly reflects reduced survival have been addressed by adding potential explanations to the text.</p><p>In addition, the previous remark (#3) that certain phrases gave the misleading impression that musk-related odors are indeed excreted into male mouse urine at certain concentrations was addressed not only by re-phrasing, but by performing additional experiments. Although these did not deliver clear results (because of technical difficulties), interesting possibilities are discussed.</p></body></sub-article><sub-article article-type="referee-report" id="sa2"><front-stub><article-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.96152.3.sa2</article-id><title-group><article-title>Reviewer #3 (Public review):</article-title></title-group><contrib-group><contrib contrib-type="author"><anonymous/><role specific-use="referee">Reviewer</role></contrib></contrib-group></front-stub><body><p>Summary</p><p>Neurogenesis in the mammalian olfactory epithelium continues throughout the animal's lifespan, replacing damaged or dying olfactory sensory neurons. It has been tacitly assumed that the replacement of olfactory receptor (OR) subtypes occurs randomly. However, anecdotal evidence has suggested otherwise. In this study, Santoro and colleagues challenge this assumption by systematically exploring three key questions: Is there enrichment of specific OR subtypes during neurogenesis? Is this enrichment influenced by sensory stimuli? Does enrichment result from differential generation of OR types or differential cell death regulated by neural activity? The authors present convincing evidence that muscone stimulus selectively enhances the neurogenesis of OSNs expressing muscone receptors, suggesting that the selection of ORs in regenerating neurons is not random.</p><p>Strengths</p><p>This study is the first in formulating and systematically testing the selective promotion hypothesis. It is a comprehensive and systematic examination of multiple musk receptors under conditions of unilateral naris occlusion and various stimuli. The controls are properly done. The quality of in situ hybridization and immunofluorescent staining is high, allowing the authors to effectively estimates the number of OR types. The data convincingly demonstrate that increased expression of musk receptors in response to male odor or muscone stimulation.</p><p>Weaknesses</p><p>The revised version has addressed most initial weaknesses. However, some inconsistencies remain, raising questions about the proposed model. For instance, in the unilateral naris occlusion experiment, although average expression of non-musk receptors shows no significant change, receptors seem to fall into two groups with one subset increasing and another decreasing (Fig. 1E). This suggests naris occlusion may regulate OR expression independently of odor-induced activity, a possibility that remains unaddressed.</p><p>There is curiosity regarding receptors for the male odor SBT, olfr912, and olfr1295, which exhibit increased expression on the occluded side. The explanation that SBT exposure shortens these neurons' lifespan lacks substantiation and is inconsistent with later data. For example, Figure 3-figure supplement 3 I does not show olfr912 changes on the UNO side, and Figure 4-figure supplement 4 shows no significant decrease in olfr912 expression in SBT-exposed mice. Additionally, single-cell RNASeq experiments did not examine olfr912 and olfr1295 expression.</p><p>While the study convincingly demonstrates muscone's selective stimulation of olfr235-expressing OSNs, it lacks exploration of the mechanisms underlying this specificity. The discussion of signaling pathways remains too generic.</p><p>In summary, while the study offers significant insights into neurogenesis and OR subtype enrichment, further investigation into underlying mechanisms and addressing existing inconsistencies would strengthen its conclusions.</p></body></sub-article><sub-article article-type="author-comment" id="sa3"><front-stub><article-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.96152.3.sa3</article-id><title-group><article-title>Author response</article-title></title-group><contrib-group><contrib contrib-type="author"><name><surname>Hossain</surname><given-names>Kawsar</given-names></name><role specific-use="author">Author</role><aff><institution>University of Colorado Anschutz Medical Campus</institution><addr-line><named-content content-type="city">Aurora</named-content></addr-line><country>United States</country></aff></contrib><contrib contrib-type="author"><name><surname>Smith</surname><given-names>Madeline</given-names></name><role specific-use="author">Author</role><aff><institution>University of Colorado Anschutz Medical Campus</institution><addr-line><named-content content-type="city">Aurora</named-content></addr-line><country>United States</country></aff></contrib><contrib contrib-type="author"><name><surname>Rufenacht</surname><given-names>Karlin E</given-names></name><role specific-use="author">Author</role><aff><institution>University of Colorado Anschutz Medical Campus</institution><addr-line><named-content content-type="city">Aurora</named-content></addr-line><country>United States</country></aff></contrib><contrib contrib-type="author"><name><surname>O'Rourke</surname><given-names>Rebecca</given-names></name><role specific-use="author">Author</role><aff><institution>University of Colorado Anschutz Medical Campus</institution><addr-line><named-content content-type="city">Aurora</named-content></addr-line><country>United States</country></aff></contrib><contrib contrib-type="author"><name><surname>Santoro</surname><given-names>Stephen W</given-names></name><role specific-use="author">Author</role><aff><institution>University of Colorado Anschutz Medical Campus</institution><addr-line><named-content content-type="city">Aurora</named-content></addr-line><country>United States</country></aff></contrib></contrib-group></front-stub><body><p>The following is the authors’ response to the original reviews</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p><bold>Reviewer #1 (Public Review):</bold></p><p>Summary:</p><p>Olfactory sensory neurons (OSNs) in the olfactory epithelium detect myriads of environmental odors that signal essential cues for survival.

In the core experiment of the study, they finally exposed naris occluded mice to a discrete odor (muscone) to test if this odor specifically accelerates the birth rates of OSN types that are responsive to this odor. This experiment reveals a complex relationship between birth rate acceleration and odor concentrations showing that some muscone concentrations affect birth rates of some members of this family and do not affect two unrelated OSN subtypes.</p></disp-quote><p>In addition to the results nicely summarized by the reviewer, which focus on experiments to examine the effects of odor stimulation on unilateral naris occluded (UNO) mice, an important part of the present study are experiments on non-occluded (i.e., non-UNO-treated) mice. These experiments show: (1) that the exposure of non-occluded mice to odors from adolescent male mice selectively increases quantities of newborn OSNs of the musk-responsive subtype Olfr235 (Figure 3G, H; previously Figure 6), (2) the exposure of non-occluded female mice to 2 different musk odorants (muscone, ambretone) selectively increases quantities of newborn OSNs of 3 musk responsive subtypes: Olfr235, Olfr1440 and Olfr1431 (Figure 4D-F; previously Figure 6), and (3) the exposure of non-occluded adult female mice to a musk odorants selectively increases quantities of newborn OSNs of musk responsive subtypes (Figure 5; previously Fig. S7).

The previously established cell birth dating assay in naris occluded mice is well performed and accompanied by several control experiments addressing potential other interpretations of the data.</p><p>Weaknesses:</p><p>(1) The main research question of this study was to test if discrete odors specifically accelerate the birth rate of OSN subtypes they stimulate, i.e. does muscone only accelerate the birth rate of OSNs that express muscone-responsive ORs, or vice versa is the birthrate of muscone-responsive OSNs only accelerated by odors they respond to?</p><p>This question is only addressed in Figure 5 of the manuscript and the results only partially support the above claim. The authors test one specific odor (muscone) and find that this odor (only at certain concentrations) accelerates the birth rate of some musk-responsive OSN subtypes, but not two other unrelated control OSN subtypes. This does not at all show that musk-responsive OSN subtypes are only affected by odors that stimulate them and that muscone only affects the birthrate of musk-responsive OSNs, since first, only the odor muscone was tested and second, only two other OSN subtypes were tested as controls, that, importantly, are shown to be generally stimulus-independent OSN subtypes (see Figure 2 and S2).</p><p>As a minimum the authors should have (a) tested if additional odors that do not activate the three musk-responsive subtypes affect their birthrate (b) choose 2-3 additional control subtypes that are known to be stimulus-dependent (from their own 2020 study) and test if muscone affects their birthrates.</p></disp-quote><p>We appreciate these suggestions. Within the revised manuscript, we have described and included the results from several new experiments:</p><p>(1) As noted by the reviewer, we had previously tested the effects of exposure to only one exogenous musk odorant, muscone, on quantities of newborn OSNs of the musk-responsive subtypes Olfr235, Olfr1440, and Olfr1431. To test whether the effects observed with muscone exposure occur with other musk odorants, we assessed the effects of exposure to ambretone (5-cyclohexadecenone), a musk odorant previously found to robustly activate musk-responsive OSNs (Sato-Akuhara et al., 2016; Shirasu et al., 2014), on quantities of newborn OSNs of 3 musk-responsive subtypes Olfr235, Olfr1440, and Olfr1431, as well as the SBT-responsive subtype Olfr912, in the OEs of non-occluded female mice. Exposure to ambretone was found to significantly increase quantities of newborn OSNs of all 3 musk-responsive subtypes (Figure 4D-F) but not the SBT-responsive subtype (Figure 4–figure supplement 4C-left), indicating that a variety of musk odorants can accelerate the birthrates of musk responsive subtypes.</p><p>(2) To verify that exogenous non-musk odors do not increase quantities of newborn OSNs of musk responsive OSN subtypes (point a, above), we quantified newborn OSNs of 3 musk-responsive subtypes, Olfr235, Olfr1440, and Olfr1431, in non-occluded female mice that were exposed to the non-musk odorants SBT or IAA. As expected, neither of these odorants significantly affected the birthrates of the subtypes tested (Figure 4D-F).</p><p>(3) To confirm that exogenous musk odors do not accelerate the birthrates of non-musk responsive OSN subtypes that were previously found to undergo stimulation-dependent neurogenesis (point b, above), we quantified newborn OSNs of 2 such subtypes, Olfr827 and Olfr1325, in non-occluded female mice that were exposed to muscone. As expected, exposure to muscone did not significantly affect the birthrates of either of these subtypes (Figure 4–figure supplement 4C-middle, right).</p><p>(4) To provide additional confirmation that only some OSN subtypes have a capacity to exhibit increases in newborn OSN quantities in the presence of odors that activate them, we compared quantities of newborn OSNs of the SBT-responsive subtype Olfr912 in non-occluded females that were either exposed to 0.1% SBT versus unexposed controls. As expected, exposure of SBT caused no significant increase in quantities of newborn Olfr912 OSNs (Figure 4–figure supplement 4C-left).</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>(2) The finding that Olfr1440 expressing OSNs do not show any increase in UNO effect size under any muscone concentration (Figure 5D, no significance in line graph for UNO effect sizes, middle) seems to contradict the main claim of this study that certain odors specifically increase birthrates of OSN subtypes they stimulate. It was shown in several studies that olfr1440 is seemingly the most sensitive OR for muscone, yet, in this study, muscone does not further increase birthrates of OSNs expressing olfr1440. The effect size on birthrate under muscone exposure is the same as without muscone exposure (0%).</p></disp-quote><p>In contrast, the supposedly second most sensitive muscone-responsive OR olfr235 shows a significant increase in UNO effect size between no muscone exposure (0%) and 0.1% as well as 1% muscone.</p><p>Findings that quantities of newborn Olfr1440 OSNs do not show a significantly greater UNO effect size in the OEs from mice exposed to muscone compared to control mice was also somewhat surprising to us. We think that there are two potential explanations for this result: (1) Unlike subtype Olfr235, subtype Olfr1440 exhibits a significant open-side bias in newborn OSN quantities in UNO-treated adolescent females even in the absence of exposure to muscone. We speculate that this subtype (as well as subtype Olfr1431) is stimulated by odors that are emitted by female mice at the adolescent stage, and/or by another environmental source. This may limit the influence of muscone exposure on the UNO effect size. (2) There is compelling evidence that odors within the environment can enter the closed side of the OE transnasally [via the nasopharyngeal canal (Kelemen, 1947)] and/or retronasally (via the nasopharynx) in UNO-treated mice [reviewed in (Coppola, 2012)]. Thus, it is conceivable that chronic exposure of UNO-treated mice to muscone results in the eventual entry on the closed side of the OE of muscone at concentrations sufficient to promote neurogenesis. If Olfr1440 is more sensitive to muscone than Olfr235 [e.g., (Sato-Akuhara et al., 2016; Shirasu et al., 2014)], OSNs of this subtype may be especially sensitive to small amounts of odors that enter the closed side of the OE transnasally and/or retronasally. These explanations are supported by the following results:</p><p>- UNO-treated females exposed to 0.1% muscone show higher quantities of newborn Olfr1440 OSNs on both the open and closed sides of the OE in muscone exposed females compared to their unexposed counterparts (Figure 4–figure supplement 1A-middle). Similar results were also observed for newborn Olfr235 OSNs (Figure 4C-middle), albeit to a lesser extent, perhaps due to the lower sensitivity of this subtype to muscone.</p><p>- In non-occluded female mice, exposure to 0.1% muscone was found to significantly increase quantities of newborn Olfr1440 OSNs, as well as newborn Olfr235 and Olfr1431 OSNs (Figure 4D-F in revised manuscript; Figure 6 in original version). Similar results were also observed upon exposure to ambretone, another musk odor (Figure 4D-F). These experiments strongly support the hypothesis that musk odors selectively increase birthrates of OSN subtypes that they stimulate.</p><p>We have addressed these points within the results section of the revised manuscript.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>(3) The authors introduce their choice to study this particular family of OSN subtypes with first, the previous finding that transcripts for one of these musk-responsive subtypes (olfr235) are downregulated in mice that are deprived of male odors. Second, musk-related odors are found in the urine of different species. This gives the misleading impression that it is known that musk-related odors are indeed excreted into male mouse urine at certain concentrations. This should be stated more clearly in the introduction (or cited, if indeed data exist that show musk-related odors in male mouse urine) because this would be a very important point from an ethological and mechanistic point of view.</p><p>In addition, this would also be important information to assess if the chosen muscone concentrations fall at all into the natural range.</p></disp-quote><p>These are important points, which have addressed within the revised manuscript:</p><p>(1) Within the introduction, we have now stated that the emission of musk odors by mice has not been documented. We have also added extensive discussions of what is known about the emission of musk odors by mice in a new subsection within Results, as well as within the Discussion section. Most prominently, we have cited one study (Sato-Akuhara et al., 2016) that noted unpublished evidence for the emission of Olfr1440-activating compounds from male preputial glands: “Indeed, our preliminary experiments suggest that there are unidentified compounds that activate MOR215-1 in mouse preputial gland extracts.” Another study, which used histomorphology, metabolomic and transcriptomic analyses to compare the mouse preputial glands to muskrat scent glands, found that the two glands are similar in many ways, including molecular composition (Han et al., 2022). However, the study did not identify known musk compounds within mouse preputial glands.</p><p>(2) Based on the reviewer’s feedback and our own curiosity, we used GC-MS to analyze both mouse urine and preputial gland extracts for the presence of known musk odorants, particularly those known to activate Olfr235 and Olfr1440 (Sato-Akuhara et al., 2016). Although we were unable to find evidence for known musk odorants in mouse urine extracts (possibly due to insufficient sensitivity of the assay employed), we found that preputial gland extracts contain GC-MS signals that are structurally consistent with known musk odorants. A limitation of this approach, however, is that the conclusive identification of specific musk odorants in extracts derived from mouse urine and tissues requires comparisons to pure standards, many of which we could not readily obtain. For example, we were unable to obtain a pure sample of cycloheptadecanol, a musk molecule with a predicted potential match to a signal identified within preputial gland extracts. Another limitation is that although several known musk odorants have been found to activate Olfr235 and Olfr1440 OSNs, it is conceivable that structurally distinct odorants that have not yet been identified might also activate them. The findings from these experiments have been included in a new figure within the revised manuscript (Appendix 2–figure 1).</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Related: If these are male-specific cues, it is interesting that changes in OR transcripts (Figure 1) can already be seen at the age of P28 where other male-specific cues are just starting to get expressed. This should be discussed.</p></disp-quote><p>We agree that the observed changes in quantities of newborn OSNs of musk-responsive subtypes in mice exposed to juvenile male odors deserves additional discussion. We have included a more extensive discussion of this observation in both the Results and Discussion sections of the revised manuscript.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>(4) Figure 5: Under muscone exposure the number of newborn neurons on the closed sides fluctuates considerably. This doesn't seem to be the case in other experiments and raises some concerns about how reliable the naris occlusion works for strong exposure to monomolecular odors or what other potential mechanisms are at play.</p></disp-quote><p>We agree that the variability in quantities of newborn OSNs of musk-responsive subtypes on the closed side of the OE of UNO-treated mice deserves further discussion. As noted above, we suspect that these fluctuations are due, at least in part, to transnasal and/or retronasal odor transfer via the nasopharyngeal canal (Kelemen, 1947) and nasopharynx, respectively [reviewed in (Coppola, 2012)], which would be expected to result in exposure of the closed OE to odor concentrations that rise with increasing environmental concentrations. In support of this, quantities of newborn Olfr235 and Olfr1440 OSNs increase on both the open and closed sides with increasing muscone concentration (except at the highest concentration, 10%, in the case of Olfr1440) (Figure 4C-middle, Figure 4–figure supplement 1A-middle). It is conceivable that reductions in newborn Olfr1440 OSN quantities observed in the presence of 10% muscone reflect overstimulation-dependent reductions in survival. Our findings from UNO-based experiments are consistent with expectations that naris occlusion does not completely block exposure to odorants on the closed side, particularly at high concentrations. However, they also appear consistent with the hypothesis that exposure to musk odors promotes the neurogenesis of musk-responsive OSN subtypes.</p><p>Considering the limitations of the UNO procedure, it is important to note that the present study also includes experimental exposure of non-occluded animals to both male odors (Figure 3G, H) and exogenous musk odorants (Figures 4D-F). Findings from the latter experiments provide strong evidence that exposure to multiple musk odorants (muscone, ambretone) causes selective increases in the birthrates of multiple musk-responsive OSN subtypes (Olfr235, Olfr1440, Olfr1431).</p><p>We have included within the Results section of the revised manuscript a discussion of how observed effects of muscone exposure of UNO-treated mice may be influenced by transnasal/ retronasal odor transfer to the closed side of the OE.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>(5) In contrast to all other musk-responsive OSN types, the number of newborn OSNs expressing olfr1437 increases on the closed side of the OE relative to the open in UNO-treated male mice (Figure 1). This seems to contradict the presented theory and also does not align with the bulk RNAseq data (Figure S1).</p></disp-quote><p>Subtype Olfr1437 is indeed an outlier among musk-responsive subtypes that were previously found to be more highly represented in the OSN population in 6-month-old sex-separated males compared to females (Appendix 1–figure 1)(C. van der Linden et al., 2018; Vihani et al., 2020). Somewhat unexpectedly, our findings from scRNA-seq experiments show slightly greater quantities of immature Olfr1437 OSNs on the closed side of the OE in juvenile males (Figure 1D, E of the revised manuscript, which now includes data from a second OE). Perhaps more informatively considering the small number of iOSNs of specific subtypes in the scRNA-seq datasets, EdU birthdating experiments show no difference in newborn Orlfr1437 OSN quantities on the 2 sides of the OE from UNO-treated juvenile males (Figure 2G). It is unclear to us why subtype Olfr1437 does not show open-side biases in newborn OSN quantities in juvenile male mice, but potential explanations include:</p><p>- Age: Findings based on bulk RNA-seq that musk responsive OSN subtypes are more highly represented in mice exposed to male odors analyzed mice that were 6 months old (C. van der Linden et al., 2018) or &gt; 9 months old (Vihani et al., 2020) at the time of analysis. By contrast, the present study primarily analyzed mice that were juveniles (PD 28) at the time of scRNA-seq analysis (Figure 1) or EdU labeling (Figure 2G). It is conceivable that different musk-responsive subtypes are selectively responsive to distinct odors that are emitted at different ages. In this scenario, odors that increase the birthrates of Olfr235, Olfr1440, and Olfr1431 OSNs may be emitted starting at the juvenile stage, while those that increase the birthrate of Olfr1437 OSNs may be emitted in adulthood. In potential support of this, juvenile males exposed to their adult parents at the time of EdU labeling showed a slightly greater (although not statistically significantly different) UNO effect size in quantities of newborn Olfr1437 OSNs compared to controls (Figure 3–figure supplement 3).</p><p>- Capacity for stimulation-dependent neurogenesis: It is also conceivable that, unlike other musk-responsive OSN subtypes, Olfr1437 OSNs lack the capacity for stimulation-dependent neurogenesis (like the SBT-responsive subtype Olfr912, for example). If so, this would imply that increased representations of Olfr1437 OSNs observed in mice exposed to male odors for long periods (C. van der Linden et al., 2018; Vihani et al., 2020) may be due to male odor-dependent increases in the lifespans of Olfr1437 OSNs.</p><p>Within the Discussion section of the revised manuscript, we have discussed the findings concerning Olfr1437.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>(6) The authors hypothesize in relation to the accelerated birthrate of musk-responsive OSN subtypes that &quot;the acceleration of the birthrates of specific OSN subtypes could selectively enhance sensitivity to odors detected by those subtypes by increasing their representation within the OE&quot;. However, for two other OSN subtypes that detect male-specific odors, they hypothesize the opposite &quot;By contrast, Olfr912 (Or8b48) and Olfr1295 (Or4k45), which detect the male-specific non-musk odors 2-sec-butyl-4,5-dihydrothiazole (SBT) and (methylthio)methanethiol (MTMT), respectively, exhibited lower representation and/or transcript levels in mice exposed to male odors, possibly reflecting reduced survival due to overstimulation.&quot;</p><p>Without any further explanation, it is hard to comprehend why exposure to male-derived odors should, on one hand, accelerate birthrates in some OSN subtypes to potentially increase sensitivity to male odors, but on the other hand, lower transcript levels and does not accelerate birth rates of other OSN subtypes due to overstimulation.</p></disp-quote><p>We agree that this point deserves further explanation. Within the revised manuscript, we have expanded the Introduction and Results to describe evidence from previous studies that exposure to stimulating odors causes two categories of changes to specific OSN subtypes: elevated representations or reduced representations within the OSN population. In one study (C. J. van der Linden et al., 2020), UNO treatment was found to cause a fraction of OSN subtypes to exhibit lower birthrates and representations on the closed side of the OE relative to the open. By contrast, another fraction of OSN subtypes exhibited higher representations on the closed side of OEs from UNO-treated mice, but no difference in birthrates between the two sides. The latter subtypes were found to be distinguished by their receipt of extremely high levels of odor stimulation, suggesting that reduced odor stimulation via naris occlusion may lengthen their lifespans. In support of the possibility that Olfr912 (and Olfr1295), which detect SBT and MTMT, respectively (Vihani et al., 2020), which are emitted specifically by male mice (Lin et al., 2005; Schwende et al., 1986), UNO treatment was previously found to increase total Olfr912 OSN quantities on the closed side compared to the open side in sex-separated males (C. van der Linden et al., 2018), a finding confirmed in the present study (Figure 3–figure supplement 1H).</p><p>Taken together, findings from previous studies as well as the current one indicate that olfactory stimulation can accelerate the birthrates and/or reduced the lifespans of OSNs, depending on the specific subtypes and odors within the environment. As we have now indicated in the Discussion, we do not yet know what distinguishes subtypes that undergo stimulation-dependent neurogenesis, but it is conceivable that they detect odors with a particular salience to mice. Thus, observations that some odorants (e.g., musks) cause stimulation-dependent neurogenesis while others do not (e.g., SBT) might reflect an animal’s specific need to adapt its sensitivity to the former. Alternatively, it is conceivable that stimulation-dependent reductions in representations of subtypes such as Olfr912 and Olfr1295 reflect a fundamentally different mode of plasticity that is also adaptive, as has been hypothesized (C. van der Linden et al., 2018; Vihani et al., 2020).</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p><bold>Reviewer #1 (Recommendations For The Authors):</bold></p><p>To support the main claim, several controls are necessary as mentioned under point 1 of the public review.</p><p>As outlined in our responses to the public review, new experiments within the revised manuscript indicate the following:</p><p>(1) Accelerated birthrates of 3 different musk responsive OSN subtypes (Olfr235, Olfr1440, Olfr1431) are observed in non-occluded mice following exposure to multiple exogenous musk odorants (muscone, ambretone) (Figure 4D-F).</p><p>(2) Exposure of non-occluded mice to non-musk odors (SBT, IAA) does not accelerate the birthrates of musk responsive OSN subtypes (Olfr235, Olfr1440, Olfr1431) (Figure 4D-F).</p><p>(3) Exposure of mice to exogenous musk odors (muscone, ambretone) does not accelerate the birthrates of non-musk responsive OSN subtypes (e.g., Olfr912), including those previously found to undergo stimulation-dependent neurogenesis (Olfr827, Olfr1325) (Figure 4–figure supplement 4C).</p><p>(4) Only a fraction of OSN subtypes have a capacity to undergo accelerated neurogenesis in the presence of odors that activate them (e.g., Olfr912 birthrates are not accelerated by SBT exposure) (Figure 4–figure supplement 4C-left).</p><p>In addition, this study could be considerably improved by showing that the proposed mechanism applies beyond a single OSN subtype (olfr235), especially since the most sensitive OR subtype (expressing olfr1440) does not align with the main claim. The introduction states that this is difficult because the ligands for many ORs are unknown including all subtypes previously found to undergo stimulation-dependent neurogenesis referring to your 2020 study. While this reviewer agrees that the lack of deorphanization is a significant hurdle in the field, the 2020 study states that about 4% of all ORs (which should equal &gt;40 ORs) show a stimulus-dependent down-regulation on the closed side, not only the 7 ORs which are closer examined (Figure 1). It would tremendously improve the impact of the current study to show that the proposed effect applies also to one of these other &gt;40 ORs.</p></disp-quote><p>We appreciate this question, as it alerted us to some shortcomings in how our findings were presented within the original manuscript. We respectfully disagree that only findings regarding subtype Olfr235 align with the main hypothesis of this study, which is that discrete odors can selectively promote the neurogenesis of sensory neuron subtypes that they stimulate. Specifically, we would like to draw attention to experiments on non-occluded female mice exposed to exogenous musk odorants (muscone, ambretone; revised Figures 4D-F; previously, Figure 6). Findings from these experiments provide compelling evidence that exposure to musk odorants causes selective increases in the birthrates of three different musk-responsive OSN subtypes: Olfr235, Olfr1440, and Olfr1431. Thus, we would suggest that results from the present study already show that the proposed mechanism applies to more than the just Olfr235 subtype. However, we agree with what we think is the essence of the reviewer’s point: that it is important to determine the extent to which this mechanism applies to OSN subtypes that are responsive to other (i.e., non-musk) odorants. While, as noted by the reviewer, our previous study identified several OSN subtypes that undergo stimulation-dependent neurogenesis (as well as many others that predicted to do so)(C. J. van der Linden et al., 2020), we are not aware of ligands that have been identified with high confidence for those subtypes. Although we are in the process of conducting experiments to identify additional odor/subtype pairs to which the mechanism described in this study applies, the early-stage nature of these experiments precludes their inclusion in the present manuscript.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>The ethological and mechanistic relevance of the current study could be significantly improved by showing that musk-related odors that activate olfr235 are actually found in male mouse urine (and additionally are not found in female mouse urine). Otherwise, the implicated link between the acceleration of OSN birthrates by exposure to male odors and acceleration by specific monomolecular odors does not hold, raising the question of any natural relevance (e.g. the proposed adaptive function to increase sensitivity to certain odors).</p></disp-quote><p>As noted in our responses to the public review, we have addressed this important point within the revised manuscript as follows:</p><p>(1) We have included an extensive discussion of what is known about the emission of musk-like odors by mice.</p><p>(2) We have used GC-MS to analyze both mouse urine and preputial gland extracts for the presence of known musk compounds. Although inconclusive, we report that preputial glands contain signals that are structurally consistent with known musk compounds. The findings of these experiments have been included in the revised manuscript (new Appendix 2–figure 1), along with a discussion of their limitations.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p><bold>Reviewer #2 (Public Review):</bold></p><p>In their paper entitled &quot;In mice, discrete odors can selectively promote the neurogenesis of sensory neuron subtypes that they stimulate&quot; Hossain et al. address lifelong neurogenesis in the mouse main olfactory epithelium. The authors hypothesize that specific odorants act as neurogenic stimuli that selectively promote biased OR gene choice (and thus olfactory sensory neuron (OSN) identity). Hossain et al. employ RNA-seq and scRNA-seq analyses for subtype-specific OSN birthdating. The authors find that exposure to male and musk odors accelerates the birthrates of the respective responsive OSNs. Therefore, Hossain et al. suggest that odor experience promotes selective neurogenesis and, accordingly, OSN neurogenesis may act as a mechanism for long-term olfactory adaptation.</p></disp-quote><p>We appreciate this summary but would like to underscore that a mechanism involving biased OR gene choice is just one of two possibilities proposed in the Discussion section to explain how odorant stimulation of specific subtypes accelerates the birthrates of those subtypes.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>The authors follow a clear experimental logic, based on sensory deprivation by unilateral naris occlusion, EdU labeling of newborn neurons, and histological analysis via OR-specific RNA-FISH. The results reveal robust effects of deprivation on newborn OSN identity. However, the major weakness of the approach is that the results could, in (possibly large) parts, depend on &quot;downregulation&quot; of OR subtype-specific neurogenesis, rather than (only) &quot;upregulation&quot; based on odor exposure. While, in Figure 6, the authors show that the observed effects are, in part, mediated by odor stimulation, it remains unclear whether deprivation plays an &quot;active&quot; role as well. Moreover, as shown in Figure 1C, unilateral naris occlusion has both positive and negative effects in a random subtype sample.</p></disp-quote><p>In our view, the present study involves two distinct and complementary experimental designs: (1) odor exposure of UNO-treated animals and (2) odor exposure of non-occluded animals. Here we address this comment with respect to each of these designs:</p><p>(1) For experiments performed on UNO-treated animals, we agree that observed differences in birthrates on the open and closed sides of the OE reflect, largely, a deceleration (i.e., downregulation) of the birthrates of these subtypes on the closed side relative to the open (as opposed to an acceleration of birthrates on the open side). Our objective in using this design was to test the extent to which specific OSN subtypes undergo stimulation-dependent neurogenesis under various odor exposure conditions. According to the main hypothesis of this study, a lower birthrate of a specific OSN subtype on the closed side of the OE compared to the open is predicted to reflect a lower level of odor stimulation on the closed side received by OSNs of that subtype. However (and as described in our responses to reviewer #1), a limitation of this design is that environmental odorants, especially at high concentrations, are likely to stimulate responsive OSNs on the closed side of the OE in addition to the open side due to transnasal and/or retronasal air flow.</p><p>(2) Experiments performed on non-occluded animals were designed to provide critical complementary evidence that specific OSN subtypes undergo accelerated neurogenesis in the presence of specific odors. Using this design, we have found compelling evidence that:</p><p>- Exposure of non-occluded mice to male odors causes the selective acceleration of the birthrate of Olfr235 OSNs (Figure 3G, H).</p><p>- Exposure of non-occluded female mice to two different musk odorants (muscone and ambretone) selectively accelerates the birthrates three different musk responsive subtypes: Olfr235, Olfr1440, and Olf1431 (Figure 4D-F and Figure 4–figure supplement 4C).</p><p>We have reorganized the revised manuscript to more clearly present the most important experimental findings using these two experimental designs. We have also highlighted (via schematics) the experimental conditions (e.g., UNO, non-occlusion, odor exposure) used for each experiment.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Another weakness is that the authors build their model (Figure 8), specifically the concept of selectivity, on a receptor-ligand pair (Olfr912 that has been shown to respond, among other odors, to the male-specific non-musk odors 2-sec-butyl-4,5-dihydrothiazole (SBT)) that would require at least some independent experimental corroboration. At least, a control experiment that uses SBT instead of muscone exposure should be performed.</p></disp-quote><p>We agree that this important concern deserves additional control experiments and discussion. We have addressed this concern within the revised manuscript as follows:</p><p>- Within the Results section, we have added multiple new control experiments (detailed in response to Reviewer #1), including the one recommended above. As suggested, we quantified newborn OSNs of the SBT-responsive subtype Olfr912 in non-occluded females that were either exposed to 0.1% SBT or unexposed controls. Exposure of SBT was found to cause no significant increase in quantities of newborn Olfr912 OSNs (newly added Figure 4–figure supplement 4C-left). These findings further support the model in Figure 7 (previously Figure 8) that only a fraction of OSN subtypes have a capacity to undergo accelerated neurogenesis in the presence of odors that activate them.</p><p>- Also within the Results section, we have made efforts to better highlight relevant control experiments that were included in the original version, particularly those showing that quantities of newborn Olfr912 OSNs are not affected by UNO in mice exposed to male odors (Figure 2H and Figure 3–figure supplement 1G; previously Figure 2F and Figure 3H) or by exposure of non-occluded females to male odors (Figure 3H; previously Figure 6E). Since Olfr235 is responsive to component(s) of male odors (C. van der Linden et al., 2018; Vihani et al., 2020), these results indicate that this subtype does not have the capacity of stimulation-dependent neurogenesis, which is consistent with our previous findings that only a fraction of subtypes have this capacity (C. J. van der Linden et al., 2020).</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>In this context, it is somewhat concerning that some results, which appear counterintuitive (e.g., lower representation and/or transcript levels of Olfr912 and Olfr1295 in mice exposed to male odors) are brushed off as &quot;reflecting reduced survival due to overstimulation.&quot; The notion of &quot;reduced survival&quot; could be tested by, for example, a caspase3 assay.</p></disp-quote><p>This is a point that we agree deserves further discussion. Please see the explanation that we have outlined above in response to Reviewer #1.</p><p>Within the revised manuscript, we have expanded the Introduction to describe evidence from previous studies that exposure to stimulating odors causes two categories of changes to specific OSN subtypes: elevated representations or reduced representations within the OSN population. We outline evidence from previous studies that Olfr912 and Olfr1295 belong to the latter category, and that the representations of these subtypes are likely reduced by male odor overstimulation-dependent shortening of OSN lifespan.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Important analyses that need to be done to better be able to interpret the findings are to present (i) the OR+/EdU+ population of olfactory sensory neurons not just as a count per hemisection, but rather as the ratio of OR+/EdU+ cells among all EdU+ cells; and (ii) to the ratio of EdU+ cells among all nuclei (UNO versus open naris). This way, data would be normalized to (i) the overall rate of neurogenesis and (ii) any broad deprivation-dependent epithelial degeneration.</p></disp-quote><p>We have addressed this concern in two ways within the revised manuscript:</p><p>(1) We have noted within the Methods section that the approach of using half-sections for normalization has been used in multiple previous studies for quantifying newborn (OR+/EdU+) and total (OR+) OSN abundances (Hossain et al., 2023; Ibarra-Soria et al., 2017; C. van der Linden et al., 2018; C. J. van der Linden et al., 2020). Additionally, within the figure legends and Methods, we have more thoroughly described the approach used, including that it relies on averaging the quantifications from at least 5 high-quality coronal OE tissue sections that are evenly distributed throughout the anterior-posterior length of each OE and thereby mitigates the effects of section size and cell number variation among sections. In the case of UNO treated mice, the open and closed sides within the same section are paired, which further reduces the effects of section-to section variation. We have found that this approach yields reproducible quantities of newborn and total OSNs among biological replicate mice and enables accurate assessment of how quantities of OSNs of specific subtypes change as a result of altered olfactory experience, a key objective of this study.</p><p>(2) To assess whether the use of alternative approaches for normalizing newborn OSN quantities suggested by the reviewers would affect the present study’s findings, we compared three methods for normalizing the effects of exposure to male odors or muscone on quantities of newborn Olfr235 OSNs in the OEs of both UNO-treated and non-occluded mice: (1) OR+/EdU+ OSNs per half-section (used in this study), (2) OR+/EdU+ OSNs per total number of EdU+ cells (reviewer suggestion (i)), and (3) OR+/EdU+ OSNs per unit of DAPI+ area (an approximate measure of nuclei number; reviewer suggestion (ii)). The three normalization methods yielded statistically indistinguishable differences in assessing the effects of exposure of either UNO-treated or non-occluded mice to male odors (newly added Figure 2–figure supplement 2 and Figure 3–figure supplement 2), or of exposure of non-occluded mice to muscone (newly added Figure 4–figure supplement 3). Based on these findings, and the considerable time that would be required to renormalize all data in the manuscript, we have chosen to maintain the use of normalization per half-section.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Finally, the paper will benefit from improved data presentation and adequate statistical testing.

In the case of EdU birthdating, it is necessary to provide a chase period of sufficient length to enable robust and stable expression of an OR, which defines the subtype.

In support of this, quantities of newborn Olfr235 (Figure 4C-middle) and Olfr1440 (Figure 4–figure supplement 1A-middle) OSNs increase on both the open and closed sides with increasing muscone concentration (except at the highest concentration, 10%, in the case of Olfr1440).

The process replaces damaged or dying olfactory sensory neurons. It has been tacitly that replacement of the OR subtypes is stochastic, although anecdotal evidence has suggested that this may not be the case. In this study, Santoro and colleagues systematically test this hypothesis by answering three questions: is there enrichment of specific OR subtypes associated with neurogenesis? Is the enrichment dependent on sensory stimulus? Is the enrichment the result of differential generation of the OR type or from differential cell death regulated by neural activity? The authors provide some solid evidence indicating that musk odor stimulus selectively promotes the OR types expressing the musk receptors. The evidence argues against a random selection of ORs in the regenerating neurons.</p><p>Strengths:</p><p>The strength of the study is a thorough and systematic investigation of the expression of multiple musk receptors with unilateral naris occlusion or under different stimulus conditions. The controls are properly performed. This study is the first to formulate the selective promotion hypothesis and the first systematic investigation to test it. The bulk of the study uses in situ hybridization and immunofluorescent staining to estimate the number of OR types. These results convincingly demonstrate the increased expression of musk receptors in response to male odor or muscone stimulation.</p><p>Weaknesses:</p><p>A major weakness of the current study is the single-cell RNASeq result. The authors use this piece of data as a broad survey of receptor expression in response to unilateral nasal occlusion. However, several issues with this data raise serious concerns about the quality of the experiment and the conclusions. First, the proportion of OSNs, including both the immature and mature types, constitutes only a small fraction of the total cells. In previous studies of the OSNs using the scRNASeq approach, OSNs constitute the largest cell population. It is curious why this is the case. Second, the authors did not annotate the cell types, making it difficult to assess the potential cause of this discrepancy. Third, given the small number of OSNs, it is surprising to have multiple musk receptors detected in the open side of the olfactory epithelium whereas almost none in the closed side. Since each OR type only constitutes ~0.1% of OSNs on average, the number of detected musk receptors is too high to be consistent with our current understanding and the rest of the data in the manuscript. Finally, unlike the other experiments, the authors did not describe any method details, nor was there any description of quality controls associated with the experiment. The concerns over the scRNASeq data do not diminish the value of the data presented in the bulk of the study but could be used for further analysis.</p></disp-quote><p>We are grateful to the reviewer for raising these important questions.</p><p>In the revised manuscript, we have clarified that the scRNA-seq dataset presented in the original version of the manuscript (now called dataset OE 1) was published and described in detail in a previous study (C. J. van der Linden et al., 2020). The reviewer is correct that the proportion of OSNs within that dataset was lower in that dataset than in other datasets that have been published more recently (using updated methods). We think this is likely because of the way that the cells were processed (e.g., from cryopreserved single cells followed by live/dead selection). However, because the open and closed sides were processed identically, we do not expect the ratios of OSNs of specific subtypes to be greatly affected. Hence, the differences observed for specific OSN subtypes on the open versus closed sides are expected to be valid.</p><p>As the reviewer notes, there is a surprisingly large difference between the number of OSNs of musk-responsive subtypes on the open and closed sides within the OE 1 dataset. This difference is a key piece of information that led us to formulate the hypothesis in the study: that musk responsive subtypes are born at a higher rate in the presence of male/musk odor stimulation. And while it is true that, on average, each subtype represents ~0.1% of the population, it is known that there is wide variance in representations among different subtypes [e.g., (Ibarra-Soria et al., 2017)]. The frequencies of the musk responsive subtypes among all OSNs on the open side of OE 1 (0.3% for Olfr235, 0.4% for olfr1440, 0.06% for Olfr1434, 0% for olfr1431, and 1% for Olfr1437) are in line with previous findings.</p><p>To confirm that the scRNA-seq findings from dataset OE 1 are not an artifact of the cell preparation methods used, we generated a second scRNA-seq dataset, OE 2, which has been added to the revised manuscript (Figure 1). The OE 2 dataset was prepared according to the same experimental timeline as OE 1, but the cells were captured immediately after dissociation and live/dead sorting via FACS. As expected, most cells within OE 2 dataset are OSNs (77% on the open side, 66% on the closed). Importantly, like the OE 1 dataset, the OE 2 dataset shows higher quantities of iOSNs of musk responsive subtypes on the open side of the OE compared to the closed (normalized for either total cells or total OSNs) (Figure 1–figure supplement 1D, E).</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>A weakness of the experiment assessing musk receptor expression is that the authors do not distinguish immature from mature OSNs. Immature OSNs express multiple receptor types before they commit to the expression of a single type. The experiments do not reveal whether mature OSNs maintain an elevated expression level of musk receptors.</p></disp-quote><p>While it is established that multiple ORs are coexpressed at a low level during OSN differentiation (Bashkirova et al., 2023; Fletcher et al., 2017; Hanchate et al., 2015; Pourmorady et al., 2024; Saraiva et al., 2015; Scholz et al., 2016; Tan et al., 2015), this has been found to occur primarily at the immediate neuronal precursor 3 (INP3) stage (Bashkirova et al., 2023; Fletcher et al., 2017), which is characterized by expression of <italic>Tex15</italic> (Fletcher et al., 2017; Pourmorady et al., 2024) and precedes the immature OSN (iOSN) stage, which is characterized by expression of <italic>Gap43</italic> (Fletcher et al., 2017; McIntyre et al., 2010; Verhaagen et al., 1989). Within the scRNA-seq datasets in the present study, iOSNs of specific subtypes are identified based on robust expression of <italic>Gap43</italic> (Log<sup>2</sup> UMI &gt; 1) and a specific OR gene (Log<sup>2</sup> UMI &gt; 2), as described in the figures and methods. Thus, the cells defined as iOSNs are expected to express a single OR gene and this expression should be maintained as iOSNs transition to mOSNs. To confirm these predictions, we carried out a detailed analysis of OR expression at three different stages of OSN differentiation: INP3, iOSN, and mOSN (Figure 1–figure supplement 2). The cells chosen for analysis express the musk-responsive ORs Olfr235 or Olfr1440 or a randomly chosen OR Olfr701, in addition to markers that define INP3, iOSN, or mOSN cells. As expected, individual iOSNs and mOSNs of musk-responsive subtypes were found to exhibit robust and singular OR expression on the open and closed sides of OEs from UNO-treated mice. Moreover, and as observed previously, INP3 cells coexpress multiple OR transcripts at low levels. A detailed description of how the analysis was performed is included in the Methods section under Quantification and statistical analysis.</p><p>Within the histology-based quantifications, newborn OSNs are identified based on their robust RNA-FISH signals corresponding to a specific OR transcript and an EdU label. Considering the EdU chase time of 7 days, most EdU-positive cells are expected to have passed the INP3 stage and be iOSNs or mOSNs. Moreover, considering the low level of OR expression within INP3 cells, it is unlikely OR transcripts are expressed at a high enough level to be detectable and/or counted at this stage and thereby affect newborn OSN quantifications.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>There are also two conceptual issues that are of concern. The first is the concept of selective neurogenesis. The data show an increased expression of musk receptors in response to male odor stimulation. The authors argue that this indicates selective neurogenesis of the musk receptor types. However, it is not clear what the distinction is between elevated receptor expression and a commitment to a specific fate at an early stage of development. As immature OSNs express multiple receptors, a likely scenario is that some newly differentiated immature OSNs have elevated expression of not only the musk receptors but also other receptors. The current experiments do not distinguish the two alternatives. Moreover, as pointed out above, it is not clear whether mature OSNs maintain the increased expression. Although a scRNASeq experiment can clarify it, the authors, unfortunately, did not perform an in-depth analysis to determine at which point of neurogenesis the cells commit to a specific musk receptor type. The quality of the scRNASeq data unfortunately also does not lend confidence for this type of analysis.</p></disp-quote><p>The addition of a second scRNA-seq dataset within the revised manuscript (Figure 1), combined with the new scRNA-seq-based analyses of OR expression in INP3, iOSN, and mOSN cells (Figure 1-figure supplement 2), provide strong evidence that iOSNs and mOSNs robustly express a single OR gene and that cellular expression is stable from the iOSN to the mOSN stage. These analyses do not support a scenario in which odor stimulation causes upregulated expression of multiple ORs and thereby causes apparent increases in quantities of newly generated OSNs that express musk-responsive ORs. Rather, the data firmly support a mechanism in which odor stimulation increases quantities of newly generated OSNs that have stably committed to the robust expression of a single musk-responsive OR.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>A second conceptual issue, the idea of homeostasis in regeneration, which the authors presented in the Introduction, needs clarification. In its current form, it is confusing. It could mean that a maintenance of the distribution of receptor types, or it could mean the proper replacement of a specific OR type upon the loss of this type. The authors seem to refer to the latter and should define it properly.</p></disp-quote><p>We have revised the Introduction section to clarify our use of the term homeostatic in one instance (paragraph 4) and replace it with more specific language in a second instance (paragraph 5).</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p><bold>Reviewer #3 (Recommendations For The Authors):</bold></p><p>Concerns over scRNASeq data.

As a percentage of all OSNs, average quantities of iOSNs of musk responsive subtypes on the open side of the OE range from 0.005% (for Olfr1431) to 0.14% (for Olfr1440) (Figure 1E).</p><p>Within the feature plots for the two datasets, the differentiation stages of indicated OSNs have been clearly defined within the figures and figure legends.

It is also important for the authors to take measures to eliminate ambient RNA contamination.</p></disp-quote><p>The revised manuscript includes a second scRNA-seq dataset (OE 2; Figure 1). Details of how both the original (OE 1) and new datasets were generated have been documented within the Methods sections of the corresponding publications [(C. J. van der Linden et al., 2020); present study]. For both datasets, live/dead selection of cells was performed, which was expected to reduce ambient RNA.</p><p>The revised manuscript also includes a new figure that provides detailed information about OR transcript expression within INP3, iOSN and mOSN cells that express one of two different musk responsive ORs or a randomly chosen OR (Figure 1-figure supplement 2). These data reveal, as reported previously (Bashkirova et al., 2023; Fletcher et al., 2017; Pourmorady et al., 2024), that low levels of multiple OR transcripts are detected in INP3 (<italic>Tex15</italic>+) cells. By contrast, iOSN (Gap43+) and mOSN (Omp+) cells robustly express a single OR, with little or no expression of other ORs.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Quantification of cells for Figure 2-7 should be changed. Instead of using cell number per 1/2 section, the data should be calculated using density using the area of the epithelium or normalized to the total number of cells (based on DAPI staining). This is because multiple sections are taken from the same mouse along the A-P axis. These sections have different sizes and numbers of cells.</p></disp-quote><p>As noted in response to a similar concern of Reviewer #2, this has been addressed in two ways within the revised manuscript:</p><p>(1) We have noted within the Methods section that the approach of using half-sections for normalization has been used in multiple previous studies for quantifying newborn (OR+/EdU+) and total (OR+) OSN abundances (Hossain et al., 2023; Ibarra-Soria et al., 2017; C. van der Linden et al., 2018; C. J. van der Linden et al., 2020). Additionally, within the figure legends and Methods, we have more thoroughly described the approach used, including that it relies on averaging the quantifications from at least 5 high-quality coronal OE tissue sections that are evenly distributed throughout the anterior-posterior length of each OE and thereby mitigates the effects of section size and cell number variation among sections. In the case of UNO treated mice, the open and closed sides within the same section are paired, which further reduces the effects of section-to section variation. We have found that this approach yields reproducible quantities of newborn and total OSNs among biological replicate mice and enables accurate assessment of how quantities of OSNs of specific subtypes change as a result of altered olfactory experience, a key objective of this study.</p><p>(2) To assess whether the use of alternative approaches for normalizing newborn OSN quantities suggested by the reviewers would affect the present study’s findings, we compared three methods for normalizing the effects of exposure to male odors or muscone on quantities of newborn Olfr235 OSNs in the OEs of both UNO-treated and non-occluded mice: (1) OR+/EdU+ OSNs per half-section (used in this study), (2) OR+/EdU+ OSNs per total number of EdU+ cells (reviewer suggestion (i)), and (3) OR+/EdU+ OSNs per unit of DAPI+ area (an approximate measure of nuclei number; reviewer suggestion (ii)). The three normalization methods yielded statistically indistinguishable differences in assessing the effects of exposure of either UNO-treated or non-occluded mice to male odors (newly added Figure 2–figure supplement 2 and Figure 3–figure supplement 2), or of exposure of non-occluded mice to muscone (newly added Figure 4–figure supplement 3). Based on these findings, and the considerable time that would be required to renormalize all data in the manuscript, we have chosen to maintain the use of normalization per half-section.</p><p>References</p><p>Bashkirova, E.
