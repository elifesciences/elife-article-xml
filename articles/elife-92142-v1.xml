Many types of cells are involved in the progression of RA joint inflammation, among which the overactivation of M1 macrophages and osteoclasts has been thought to be an essential cause of joint inflammation and bone destruction. Glioma-associated oncogene homolog 1 (GLI1) has been revealed to be closely linked to bone metabolism. In this study, GLI1 expression in the synovial tissue of RA patients was positively correlated with RA-related scores and was highly expressed in collagen-induced arthritis (CIA) mouse articular macrophage-like cells. The decreased expression and inhibition of nuclear transfer of GLI1 downregulated macrophage M1 polarization and osteoclast activation, the effect of which was achieved by modulation of DNA methyltransferases (DNMTs) via transcriptional regulation and protein interactions. By pharmacological inhibition of GLI1, the proportion of proinflammatory macrophages and the number of osteoclasts were significantly reduced, and the joint inflammatory response and bone destruction in CIA mice were alleviated. This study clarified the mechanism of GLI1 in macrophage phenotypic changes and activation of osteoclasts, suggesting potential applications of GLI1 inhibitors in the clinical treatment of RA.</p></abstract><kwd-group kwd-group-type="author-keywords"><kwd>rheumatoid arthritis</kwd><kwd>macrophage</kwd><kwd>osteoclast</kwd><kwd>GLI1</kwd><kwd>DNMTs</kwd></kwd-group><kwd-group

sec-type="intro"><title>Introduction</title><p>Rheumatoid arthritis (RA) is a common chronic inflammatory disease that currently affects approximately 75 million people worldwide. In addition to arthritis symptoms, RA can eventually lead to disability or even death (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Firestein, 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Kim et al., 2019</xref>). Although the mechanism of RA is not clear, it is generally believed that synovial inflammation and bone erosion are the direct factors causing joint damage. Therefore, unraveling the molecular pathways that underlie immune regulation and bone destruction is of major interest to better understand the pathophysiology of RA and to design new approaches to achieve a therapy for this severe joint disease.</p><p>Persistent activation of immune cells leads to the progression of symptoms such as synovitis in RA. This immune-mediated disorder involves both innate and adaptive cellular compartments as well as their dysregulated cytokine production. In addition, the pathological process of RA is promoted through the synergistic action of the cellular resident in the bone and in joint compartments, such as osteoclasts, chondrocytes and stromal cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Komatsu and Takayanagi, 2022</xref>). Within the innate immune function that causes inflammation, macrophages have a key role. In fact, they contribute to normal tissue homeostasis, working as antigen-presenting cells (APCs) to activate adaptive immunity, pathogen expulsion, resolution of inflammation and wound healing (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Tardito et al., 2019</xref>). Classically activated macrophages (M1), which have been proven to be dominant in RA joints, cause joint erosion, secreting principally proinflammatory cytokines such as tumor necrosis factor α (TNF-α), interleukin 1β (IL-1β) and IL-6, whereas alternatively activated macrophages (M2) contribute to tissue remodeling and repair via high production of anti-inflammatory cytokines (mainly IL-10 and TGF-β) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Cho et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Tardito et al., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib40">Wu et al., 2020</xref>). Another hallmark is irreversible bone destruction, which is led by osteoclasts. The RA microenvironment and proinflammatory cytokines stimulate the formation of osteoclasts, which have long been considered the only cells capable of absorbing bone matrix, and the subsequent degradation of bone and cartilage (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Bustamante et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">Woo et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib41">Yang et al., 2019</xref>). Consequently, effectively hindering the overactivation of osteoclasts is one of the keys to alleviating excessive bone resorption.</p><p>The hedgehog pathway, which has been shown to be closely involved in osteogenesis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Jemtland et al., 2003</xref>), is highly conserved and critical for normal embryogenesis. The hedgehog protein family consists of hedgehog ligands that bind the cell surface transmembrane receptor patch (PTCH) and function through posttranslational processing of glioma-associated oncogene homolog (GLI) zinc finger transcription factors (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Rimkus et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Sasai et al., 2019</xref>). To date, three mammalian GLI proteins have been identified, among which GLI1 usually acts as a transcriptional activator. On the basis of these studies, small molecular compounds such as GANT58 (selective inhibitor of GLI1) and GANT61 (inhibitor of GLI1 and GLI2) are often used as pharmacological interventions of GLI1, so as to achieve the purpose of inhibiting GLI1 activity and regulating the molecular biological processes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Chen et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Schneider et al., 2018</xref>). Many of the physiopathological processes involved with GLIs are complex and worth discussing. Relevant studies have shown that GLI1-activated transcription promotes the development of inflammatory diseases such as gastritis, and antagonizing GLI1 transcription can alleviate the inflammatory degradation of articular cartilage (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Ali et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Kopinke et al., 2021</xref>). Accordingly, these clues suggest that GLI1 may be involved in inflammation and bone erosion processes, driving us to explore its role and regulatory mechanisms in RA.</p><p>DNA methylation, which is activated by DNA methyltransferases (DNMTs), is an important epigenetic marker that plays an important role in regulating gene expression, maintaining chromatin structure, gene imprinting, X chromosome inactivation and embryo development (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Li and Zhang, 2014</xref>). As reported, DNMT1 and DNMT3a are involved in the progression of many physiological disorders, such as the immune response and cell differentiation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Fu et al., 2022</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Ramabadran et al., 2023</xref>). In this study, we investigated the association of GLI1 with RA as well as the critical role of GLI1 in the pathological process of joint inflammation and bone destruction. It was confirmed that inhibition of GLI1 could reduce inflammatory bone destruction in collagen-induced arthritis (CIA) mice. Mechanistically, the intranuclear translocation of GLI1 was shown to promote M1 polarization of macrophages and overactivation of osteoclasts by collaborative regulation of DNMTs. In general, this study not only clarified the pivotal role and mechanism of GLI1 in joint inflammation and bone destruction in RA but also suggested potential applications of GLI1 inhibitors in clinical treatment.</p></sec><sec id="s2" sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><sec id="s2-1"><title>GLI1 expression is elevated in human RA synovium, and a selective inhibitor of GLI1 can alleviate joint bone destruction in CIA mice</title><p>To determine the relationship between GLI1 expression and the RA process, we collected synovial tissue from RA patients and noninflammatory joint disease donors and obtained informed consent from the patients. Compared with normal synovial tissue, the synovium of RA patients had a high degree of inflammatory cell infiltration (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1A</xref>). Immunohistochemical (IHC) staining showed that there were more GLI1-positive cells in RA synovium than in normal synovium (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1B and C</xref>). The results of western blotting further verified the upregulation of GLI1 in the joint synovium of RA patients (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1A–C</xref>). We performed a DAS28 score on the included patients to initially assess RA activity and then matched the relative expression of GLI1 with them, indicating that GLI1 was more highly expressed in RA patients. These results were of concern to us and implied that GLI1 plays a catalytic role in the pathological process of RA.</p><fig-group><fig id="fig1" position="float"><label>Figure 1.</label><caption><title>GLI1 is highly expressed in human RA synovium and regulates the pathological process of joint inflammatory bone destruction in CIA mice.</title><p>(<bold>A</bold>) H&amp;E staining of normal and RA human synovium.

All mice survived and were included in the analysis. H&amp;E staining results showed no hepatorenal toxicity of GANT58 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s2">Figure 1—figure supplement 2</xref>). After secondary immunization, CIA mouse paws swelled rapidly, and weight loss occurred simultaneously, which could be reversed by GANT58 treatment (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s3">Figure 1—figure supplement 3A, B</xref>). Based on the arthritis score, it could be observed that after 21 days of modeling, the scores of the mice in the vehicle group increased significantly. Obviously, the arthritis scores of GANT58-treated mice were remarkably lower than those of mice in the vehicle group (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1D</xref>). We photographed the hind paws of mice in each group and found that CIA mice had obvious signs of arthritis, while mice in the GANT58 treatment group showed a slight degree of swelling, which was similar to that of normal mice (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1E</xref>). Micro-CT was performed to scan the mouse paws and ankle joints. As shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1F</xref>, compared with sham group mice, vehicle group mice had more obvious bone destruction, and GANT58 treatment alleviated this effect. Through the analysis of bone parameters in the joint part of the mouse foot claw, we also found that the bone parameters were markedly better in the GANT58-treated mice than in the vehicle control mice (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1G</xref>). Based on these results, we performed histological sectioning and staining of mouse paw articular tissue as well as knee tissue to evaluate pathological histological changes in the joints. The results showed that GANT58 intervention significantly reduced the degree of inflammatory cell infiltration and joint bone destruction (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1H, I</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s3">Figure 1—figure supplement 3C, D</xref>). This evidence suggested that inhibiting the activity of GLI1 significantly reduced the occurrence and development of arthritis in CIA mice. However, it is not clear what the specific regulatory effect of GLI1 is. Thus, we performed immunofluorescence colocalization staining of the macrophage marker F4/80 and GLI1 both in subchondral bone marrow cavity and synovial tissue and observed that the high expression of GLI1 in CIA mice was mostly located in macrophage-like cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1J</xref>).

Cell viability was measured by CCK-8 assay before the in vitro use of GANT58, and the results showed that GANT58 had no significant inhibitory effect on either BMMs or RAW264.7 cells until the concentration reached 40 μM (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s1">Figure 2—figure supplement 1A–D</xref>). We treated cells with a concentration of 10 μM and found that it reduced the expression of GLI1 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s2">Figure 2—figure supplement 2A, B</xref>). Subsequently, we performed GANT58 intervention on M1-induced macrophages, collecting and detecting changes in inflammatory cytokine content in the cell supernatant. Stimulated by LPS and IFN-γ, macrophages release a large number of proinflammatory cytokines, including IL-1β, IL-6, and TNF-α. After the inhibitory intervention of GLI1, the content of these cytokines was significantly reduced, while the release inhibition of IL-10 was alleviated to some extent (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2C–F</xref>). Immunofluorescence staining suggested that the GANT58 group exhibited fewer iNOS-positive cells and near-basic levels of Arg-1 expression compared to cells in the LPS and IFN-γ-treated groups (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2G–I</xref>), and the western blot results supported the same conclusion (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s3">Figure 2—figure supplement 3A, B</xref>). To rule out the change in cytokine release caused by the change in cell number, we also detected the expression level of proinflammatory cytokine mRNA. The results showed that GANT58 also reduced the expression of the <italic>Il1b, Il6</italic> and <italic>Tnfa</italic> genes (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s3">Figure 2—figure supplement 3C</xref>).In addition, we examined the expression and distribution of GLI1 in cells under different interventions and found that GANT58 significantly reduced the nucleation transport of GLI1 while inhibiting the proinflammatory state of cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2J and K</xref>). According to the above results, we knocked down <italic>Gli1</italic> by siRNA to further verify the specificity of GLI1 in regulating the polarization of macrophages (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s2">Figure 2—figure supplement 2A, B</xref>, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="supp1">Supplementary file 1</xref>). According to the results of western bolt, the si<italic>Gli1</italic> #1 was used for <italic>Gli1</italic> knockdown in the next experiments. As shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2L and M</xref>, compared with wild-type (WT) macrophages, si<italic>Gli1</italic> macrophages showed lower iNOS expression induced by LPS and IFN-γ. Subsequently, we performed immunofluorescence co-staining of F4/80 and CD86 in animal model tissues, and compared with more CD86-positive M1 macrophages in the synovial tissue of mice in the CIA model group, the number of positive macrophages of the proinflammatory phenotype after GANT58 treatment was significantly reduced (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2N and O</xref>). These results confirmed that GANT58 was capable of reducing the maturation of M1 macrophages and the release of proinflammatory cytokines by affecting the activation of GLI1 both in vitro and in vivo.</p></sec><sec id="s2-3"><title>The expression and intranuclear transport of GLI1 is involved in osteoclast activation</title><p>The overactivation of osteoclasts is the direct cause of bone destruction in RA. As described in the in vivo experimental results in the first part, we found that GLI1 is highly expressed in macrophage-like cells in the subchondral bone of the joints, which raised our concerns about GLI1 and osteoclasts. To investigate the role of GLI1 in osteoclast formation, we measured GLI1 protein expression in RAW264.7 2 days after RANKL induction. The results showed that after RANKL stimulation, more GLI1 was activated and transferred to the nucleus (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3A and B</xref>). Thus, to confirm the regulatory function of GLI1 in the differentiation of osteoclasts, we used GANT58 to intervene in GLI1 activity during RANKL induction. Primary BMMs were isolated and cultured with M-CSF, followed by stimulation with RANKL, with or without 6hr of GANT58 pretreatment. As a result, there was less osteoclast formation in the GANT58-treated group than in the RANKL stimulation group (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3C and D</xref>). To eliminate the influence of drug-induced apoptosis on osteoclast activation, we carried out live/dead staining and apoptosis detection on BMMs. We found that there was no obvious death or apoptosis at a working concentration of 10 μM. However, when the concentration was increased by four times, more apoptotic cells appeared (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s1">Figure 3—figure supplement 1A, B</xref>). Osteoclast formation is accompanied by high expression of NFATc1. Immunofluorescence staining showed that the number of NFATc1-positive cells decreased significantly after GANT58 treatment (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3E</xref>). We further performed the same treatment on the macrophage cell line RAW264.7. Tartrate-resistant acid phosphatase (TRAP) and F-actin staining confirmed that GANT58 intervention greatly reduced the formation of mature osteoclasts as well (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3F and G</xref>). Then, we extracted the total protein from RAW264.7 cells with different treatments and performed western blot experiments. According to the results, we found that GANT58 hindered the activation of GLI1 translocation into the nucleus (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3H and I</xref>). Subsequently, we further induced osteoclasts in WT and <italic>Gli1</italic>-knockdown macrophages. The results showed that the inhibition of GLI1 expression reduced the formation of osteoclasts, suggesting the specificity of GLI1 in regulating the activation of osteoclasts (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3J and K</xref>). During osteoclast induction, both GANT58 treatment and <italic>Gli1</italic> knockdown significantly inhibited the expression of markers related to osteoclast function, including NFATc1, CTSK and MMP9 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3L and M</xref>). To further verify the effect of GLI1 osteoclast activation in RA, we performed TRAP staining of knee subchondral bone in mice of different groups. The results showed that there was more osteoclast formation around the bone tissue in the CIA model group. After GANT58 treatment, the number of osteoclasts decreased, and the trabecular morphology was close to the normal tissue level (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3N and O</xref>).

DNA methylation is an important epigenetic modification that regulates gene expression and is activated by DNMTs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Li and Zhang, 2014</xref>). In mammals, DNMT1 and DNMT3a are the main methylation regulatory enzymes responsible for the de novo methylation and methylation maintenance of DNA. Furthermore, we searched for the correlation between GLI1 and DNMTs in mouse species on the public platform GeneMANIA.The results of bioinformatics analysis showed a latent relationship between GLI1 and DNMTs as well (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s1">Figure 4—figure supplement 1D</xref>). Thus, through RT‒qPCR validation, we found that <italic>Dnmt3a</italic> was clearly inhibited after GANT58 intervention, but the expression of <italic>Dnmt1</italic> did not appear to change significantly (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4D</xref>). Similar results were also observed in <italic>Gli1</italic> knockdown cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s2">Figure 4—figure supplement 2A, B</xref>). With further detection of DNMTs protein expression in human synovial tissues, we found that DNMT1 and DNMT3a were more highly expressed in RA patients (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s2">Figure 4—figure supplement 2C, D</xref>). Moreover, the RT‒qPCR results showed that <italic>Dnmt1</italic> was more highly expressed in M1 macrophages, while <italic>Dnmt3a</italic> mRNA was more highly expressed during osteoclast induction (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4E and F</xref>). To this end, we wondered whether there will be another outcome in different induction states. Therefore, we further examined DNMT1 and DNMT3a expression changes during M1 macrophage and osteoclast induction processes with or without GANT58 intervention. It is interesting to note that although GANT58 only affected the expression of the <italic>Dnmt3a</italic> gene in the resting state, the western blot results suggested that GANT58 reduced the expression of DNMT1 during M1 macrophage induction and the expression of DNMT3a during osteoclast induction (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4G and H</xref>). The expression and localization of the proteins detected by immunofluorescence staining demonstrated that DNMT1 and DNMT3a were highly expressed in the nucleus under LPS/IFN-γ and RANKL stimulation, and GANT58 reduced their nuclear expression in both RAW264.7 cells and BMMs (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s3">Figure 4—figure supplement 3A, B</xref>). In view of the above findings,Co-IP protein binding experiments of cells in the resting states have found that DNMT1, but not DNMT3a protein, could be pulled down by the antibody of GLI1, suggesting that there was direct binding between GLI1 and DNMT1 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4I and J</xref>). Accordingly, we used the ZDOCK server to find possible binding sites and performed docking of the protein–protein interface interaction of GLI1 and DNMT1 with PyMOL (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4K</xref>, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="supp2">Supplementary file 2</xref>).

By staining mouse joints for IHC, we found that DNMT1 was more highly expressed in the CIA model group, while its expression was reduced in the GANT58 treatment group (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5A and B</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5s1">Figure 5—figure supplement 1A, B</xref>). We first observed the alteration of DNMTs during in vitro macrophage polarization induction. The western blot results showed that DNMT1 was more highly expressed during M1 macrophage induction (stimulated by LPS and IFN-γ) than during M2 induction (stimulated by IL-4; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5C–E</xref>). To investigate the effect of DNMTs on macrophages, the DNMT3a-specific inhibitor theaflavin-3,3’-digallate (TF3) and the DNMT1-specific inhibitor procainamide (PR) were utilized for DNMTs intervention. The CCK-8 results showed that TF3 did not inhibit cell proliferation at concentrations ranging from 0 to 5 μM in either BMMs or RAW264.7 cells, and no obvious proliferative toxic effect of PR could be seen on BMMs or RAW264.7 cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5s2">Figure 5—figure supplement 2A–D</xref>). We used different interventions to treat LPS/IFN-γ-induced macrophages and performed immunofluorescence staining to observe the expression of iNOS in proinflammatory M1 macrophages. An increase in the number of iNOS-positive cells was observed after stimulation with LPS and IFN-γ, and similar to the effect of GANT58, the inhibition of DNMT1, but not DNMT3a, was able to reduce M1 macrophage numbers (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5H</xref>). In addition to pharmacological intervention, we also knocked down <italic>Dnmts</italic> using siRNA (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5s2">Figure 5—figure supplement 2E, F</xref>).

Meanwhile, western blot results showed that DNMT3a was also highly expressed during RANKL induction, while DNMT1 had no obvious change (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6A and B</xref>). To investigate the effect of DNMT3a and DNMT1 on osteoclast formation, the DNMT3a-specific inhibitor TF3 and the DNMT1-specific inhibitor PR were used for intervention during osteoclast induction. We first treated both primary BMMs and RAW264.7 cells with TF3 and PR simultaneously during osteoclast induction. As a result, RANKL-induced osteoclast formation was strongly inhibited by TF3 but not PR treatment (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6D–G</xref>). IRF8, a negative regulator of osteoclast activation, is downregulated by DNA methylation during osteoclast formation. Through RT‒qPCR detection, it was found that the expression of <italic>Irf8</italic> in si<italic>Dnmt3a</italic> cells was higher than that in the RANKL control group (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6s1">Figure 6—figure supplement 1D</xref>).

To find a better treatment strategy, we hope to identify a key target that can regulate inflammatory bone destruction using its specific inhibitor and clarify its specific mechanism to carry out targeted interventions and achieve the desired therapeutic effect. Macrophages are an important source of inflammatory cytokines and the primary cells associated with osteoclast formation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Shapouri-Moghaddam et al., 2018</xref>). In RA, M1 macrophage polarization is generally considered an important factor that promotes the development of inflammation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Matsumoto et al., 2016</xref>). The release of the proinflammatory cytokines IL-1β, IL-6, and TNF-α promotes the activation of more osteoclasts and leads to the destruction of bone structure.</p><p>GLI1 is a downstream transcription factor of the hedgehog-GLI signaling pathway. After hedgehog is activated, GLI1 and its factors form a complex with microtubules, enter the nucleus and activate downstream gene transcription (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Kopinke et al., 2021</xref>). In previous studies, GLI1 signal transduction and other pathways, including the NF-κB signaling pathway, were usually studied in tumor-associated diseases and are considered a response network that promotes cancer development (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">Wils and Bijlsma, 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib44">Zeng and Ju, 2018</xref>). Qin. et al. found that the content of SHH in RA patient serum increased significantly compared with that in healthy patients (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Qin et al., 2016</xref>). At the same time, our study also showed that GLI1 was more highly expressed in the joint tissue of RA patients. These results suggest that the HH-GLI signaling pathway may be involved in the regulation of the pathological process of RA. However, the research results of the hedgehog pathway in bone metabolism are complex. In Heller’s report, enhanced hedgehog signaling due to PTCH heterozygosity indirectly enhanced tumor-induced bone resorption (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Heller et al., 2012</xref>); Ling also demonstrated that the inhibition of GLI1 maintained bone mass (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib42">Ye et al., 2018</xref>). These results showed that GLI1 had a potential connection with the formation of osteoclasts. In contrast, Shoko Onodera concluded that impaired osteoblastogenesis was restored to normal levels by treatment with a small molecule that actives hedgehog signaling (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Onodera et al., 2020</xref>). This diversity may be due to the unknown complex mechanism of various factors in the activation of the hedgehog signaling pathway. In our study, we found that GANT58 had an obvious inhibitory effect on the osteoclastic induction of BMMs and RAW264.7 cells, which was consistent with the results of Heller’s study. This seems to mean that the activation of GLI1 may have multiple effects on the regulation of bone tissue homeostasis and maintain a balance in the physiological state. Inflammation is an important reason for osteoclast activation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Hwang et al., 2018</xref>). The release of proinflammatory cytokines promotes arthritis and osteoclastogenesis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">Tran et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib46">Zhu et al., 2018</xref>). Our study showed that GANT58 inhibited the formation of M1 macrophages in an inflammatory environment and inhibited the expression of the proinflammatory cytokines IL-1β, IL-6, and TNF-α. Interestingly, in previous studies, it was found that GLI1 did not appear to respond very strongly to LPS intervention alone (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Collins et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Sheng et al., 2021</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib45">Zhang et al., 2022</xref>). In this study, GLI1 played a positive role in the formation of M1 macrophages, and at this point, the role of IFN-γ may be more important. Studies have reported that simple IFN-γ stimulation promotes the expression of GLI1 in neuron precursor cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Sun et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">Wang et al., 2021</xref>). These results seem to further confirm that the immunomodulatory role of GLI1 in RA is mainly achieved by macrophage polarization changes. In subsequent studies, we may be able to further explore the regulatory effects of LPS and IFN-γ on GLI1.</p><p>To clarify the downstream regulatory mechanism of GLI1, bioinformatics prediction analysis and RNA-seq were performed and ultimately identified the downstream DNMT family. In addition to normal physiological development, the abnormal expression of DNMTs causes the development of tumors and other diseases (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Mohd Murshid et al., 2022</xref>). Through treatment with DNMT inhibitors, inflammatory arthritis in mice was significantly relieved, which was consistent with previous studies (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">Tóth et al., 2019</xref>). These results suggested that DNMTs might be involved in the inflammatory reaction and bone destruction of RA. Reports have suggested that the absence of DNMT3a inhibits the formation of osteoclasts, which may be due to the methylation of downstream IRF8 by DNMT3a (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Nishikawa et al., 2015</xref>). In our study, we also verified this finding through pharmacological and genetic interventions. Similarly, in myeloma disease models, high expression of DNMT3a is thought to promote hypermethylation of Runx2, osterix and IRF8 CpG islands and inhibit the expression of these genes, thus inhibiting osteoblasts and promoting osteoclast activation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">Wen et al., 2020</xref>). In contrast to DNMT3a, the overexpression of <italic>Dnmt1</italic> promotes proinflammatory cytokine production in macrophages and plasma during atherosclerosis and inflammation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Anto Michel et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib43">Yu et al., 2016</xref>). Notably, GANT58 significantly inhibited DNMT1 and DNMT3a activation during M1 macrophage and osteoclast induction, and overexpression of <italic>Dnmt3a</italic> and <italic>Dnmt1</italic> reversed the inhibitory effect of GANT58 on the formation of osteoclasts and M1 macrophages. According to the sequencing and research results, GLI1 activity is closely related to the expression activity of DNMTs. In the cell resting state, we found that the inhibitory effect of GANT58 on DNMTs was limited to DNMT3a at the level of gene transcription, while Co-IP analysis found a binding relationship between GLI1 and DNMT1 but not DNMT3a. This evidence suggested that the active regulation of GLI1 on DNMT1 might be post-protein translation, while the regulation of DNMT3a expression might be located at the gene transcriptional level. The molecular function of GLI1 usually acts as a transcriptional activator. Patricia Gonz á lez Rodr í Guez’s latest research shows that during autophagy induction, selective GLI1 enrichment can be observed in the regions closer to the transcription start site (TSS) of the DNMT3a gene (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">González-Rodríguez et al., 2022</xref>). This finding supports our speculation that GLI1 may play a regulatory role by combining with the DNMT3a promoter region sequence.</p><p>In vivo experiments using the GLI1 inhibitor GANT58 showed its anti-inflammatory role and protection of bone mass. GANT58 showed good therapeutic effects on CIA mice and inhibited the number of osteoclasts around bone tissue. These results not only elucidated, to a certain extent, the molecular mechanism by which GLI1 influences the pathological process of RA but also showed the potential therapeutic effect of GANT58 on inflammatory bone destruction in RA, which might have clinically translatable research implications. Although we have demonstrated that the inhibition of GLI1 by GANT58 can reduce the inflammatory response and inhibit osteoclast formation and that this mechanism is achieved through the downregulation of DNMTs, these findings also raise new questions. In a previous research report, <italic>Gli1</italic> haplodeficiency in mice decreased bone mass with reduced bone formation compared to control mice, which was due to osteoblasts with weakened function (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Kitaura et al., 2014</xref>). In this process, the osteogenic differentiation of mesenchymal stem cells also affects the function of osteoclasts. In addition, GLI1 is also used as a marker for osteogenic progenitors, which are precursors of chondrocytes and osteoblasts (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Shi et al., 2017</xref>). These studies suggest that the regulation of GLI1 on bone metabolism is complex, and the therapeutic effect of GANT58 on RA may be more than just affecting the inflammatory reaction mediated by macrophages and the bone destruction mediated by osteoclasts. In addition to macrophages and osteoclasts, synovial fibroblasts and osteoblasts play essential roles in the RA microenvironment. These cells are also closely linked to each other. Synovial fibroblast OPG and RANKL secreted by osteoblasts are important factors that regulate osteoclasts. Therefore, in a follow-up study, we will extend the study of GLI1 to its regulatory mechanism in osteoblasts.</p></sec><sec id="s4" sec-type="materials|methods"><title>Materials and methods</title><sec id="s4-1"><title>Experimental animals and human synovial tissue</title><p>All animals were ordered through the Animal Experiment Center of Soochow University.

The sections were then rehydrated in an ethanol solution. After being washed, the sections were immersed in hematoxylin dye (Leagene, Beijing, China) for 3 min. Color separation with 1% hydrochloric acid in ethanol and ammonia was then performed. The sections were then immersed in eosin dye (Leagene) and dehydrated with ethanol and xylene after being washed. Bone erosion and fibrosis were visualized and assessed by optical microscopy. Inflammatory cell infiltration was scored from 0 to 3 (0: no infiltration; 1: a small amount of local infiltration; 2: extensive local infiltration; 3: extensive infiltration into the joint capsule with the formation of agglomerates) according to H&amp;E staining.</p></sec><sec id="s4-5"><title>Cell culture</title><p>Murine BMMs and RAW264.7 cells were used in this experiment. BMMs were extracted from the C57BL/6 mouse long bones of the lower limbs and cultured in α-minimum essential medium (MEM; HyClone, California, USA) containing 10% fetal bovine serum (FBS; Gibco, California, USA), 30 ng/ml macrophage colony stimulating factor (M-CSF; R&amp;D Systems, Minnesota, USA) and 100 U/ml penicillin/streptomycin (P/S, NCM Biotech, Suzhou, China). RAW264.7 (National Collection of Authenticated Cell Cultures; TCM13) cells were cultured in DMEM (HyClone). All cells were cultured in a 37 ℃ standard environment and stored at –80 ℃ with serum-free cell freezing medium (NCM Biotech, Suzhou, China).</p></sec><sec id="s4-6"><title>Cell viability</title><p>Cell viability was assessed by a cell counting kit 8 (CCK-8; ApexBio, Houston, USA) assay according to the manufacturer’s protocol. The inhibition rate was calculated as follows: inhibition rate (x) = (OD<sub>control</sub> - OD<sub>x</sub>)/OD<sub>control.</sub> A Live/Dead cell staining kit (Yeasen) consisting of Calcein-AM (green fluorescence) and propidium iodide (PI, red fluorescence) and Annexin V/PI staining kit (Beyotime, Shanghai, China) was used according to the instructions to assess cell apoptosis.</p></sec><sec id="s4-7"><title>Tartrate-resistant acid phosphatase (TRAP) staining</title><p>A TRAP staining kit (Sigma) was used in this experiment. The dye solution was prepared according to the instructions. For tissue staining, after the tissue sections were dewaxed, a low concentration ethanol solution was added to rehydrate the sections. The repair solution was added to the surface of the tissue for antigen repair. Then, TRAP solution was added and incubated in the dark for 1 hr. For osteoclast induction, BMMs and RAW264.7 cells were seeded in 24-well plates at densities of 4×104/well and 6×104/well, respectively. RANKL (50 ng/ml) was added to the medium. For cell staining, the cells were first fixed with 4% paraformaldehyde for 15 min and then incubated with TRAP dye solution for 40 min. The positive cells were observed under an inverted optical microscope.</p></sec><sec id="s4-8"><title>Immunofluorescence staining</title><p>BMMs were seeded in 24-well plates at a density of 4×10<sup>4</sup>/well and stimulated with RANKL (50 ng/ml) or LPS (100 ng/ml)+IFN-γ (20 ng/ml). After culturing and stimulation, all cells were fixed with 4% paraformaldehyde for 15 min. To fully bind the antibody to the antigen, 0.1% Triton X-100 (Beyotime) solution was added and incubated on ice for 10 min. Then, the cells were washed with PBS 3 times, and blocking buffer was added to the cells for 1 hr. The cell supernatant was removed, and the prepared primary antibody solution was added, followed by incubation at 4 ℃ for 12 hr. The primary antibody was removed, and the fluorescent secondary antibody solution was added and incubated at room temperature for 1 hr. Finally, DAPI dye (1:20; Yuanye, Shanghai, China) solution was added and incubated for 10 min, and then the cells were photographed under a fluorescence microscope (Leica, Wetzlar, Germany). Finally, the mean fluorescence intensity and co-location coefficient (Pearson’s R value) was acquired and analyzed by ImageJ software (Version 1.8.0.112).</p></sec><sec id="s4-9"><title>ELISA</title><p>LPS and IFN-γ-induced cell supernatants were collected.

First, cells were collected to extract total protein, and the BCA (Beyotime) method was used to adjust the protein concentration. Total protein was mixed with 5×loading buffer (Beyotime) and boiled at 95 °C for 10 min. For cytoplasmic/nuclear isolation, cells were collected, and protein was extracted according to the instructions using a nuclear protein and cytoplasmic protein extraction kit (Beyotime). The proteins were separated by SDS polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis (SDS–PAGE; EpiZyme, Shanghai, China) based on their different molecular weights. Electrophoresis was performed using Bio-Rad (California, USA) equipment at 180 V for 40 min. Then, the proteins were transferred to a nitrocellulose membrane at 350 mA for 70 min using membrane transfer equipment (Bio-Rad). The membrane was removed and placed into western blot blocking buffer for 1 hr at room temperature.

After the cell treatment was completed, cells of the control group and GANT58-treated group were collected, and RNA-seq detection and analysis were entrusted to a professional biological company (Azenta Life Sciences, Suzhou, China). Briefly, for differential expression gene analysis, the differential expression conditions were set as fold change (FC) &gt;1.5 and false discovery rate (FDR)&lt;0.05. Among the differentially expressed genes, we performed GO analysis of the biological process and showed the top 20 enriched biological activities. KEGG analysis of the pathway team enrichment was then performed, and we showed the top 30 enriched pathways. In these pathways, we classified them into cellular processes (red), human diseases (blue) and organismal systems (green) and showed the enrichment of TOP5 in each category.</p></sec><sec id="s4-13"><title>Coimmunoprecipitation (Co-IP)</title><p>After culture under the specified conditions, the cells to be tested were collected.

Thank you for your letter and the Reviewers’ comments on March 13, 2023 regarding our manuscript titled “GLI1 facilitates rheumatoid arthritis by collaborative regulation of DNA methyltransferases” (Manuscript #: RC-2023-01868). Those comments are all valuable and helpful for revising and improving our manuscript. Here, we have made a full revision on the manuscript to describe them more clearly and comprehensive.</p><p>We earnestly appreciate Editors/Reviewers’ warm work and hope that these revisions have improved the manuscript such that you and the Reviewers will deem it worthy of publication. Once again, thank you very much for your assistance. If there are any problems or questions about our manuscript, please do not hesitate to contact us at the address below.</p><p><italic>Point-by-point description of the revisions</italic></p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Reviewer #1 (Evidence, reproducibility and clarity (Required)):</p><p>Summary</p><p>Ge et al. defined the role of Gli1 in M1 macrophage activation and osteoclast differentiation in physiological conditions and inflammatory arthritis. The authors found that Gli1 expression is elevated in human RA synovial tissue relative to that in healthy donor controls. Moreover, the authors showed that the administration of GANT58, a Gli1 inhibitor, ameliorates inflammation and bone erosion in CIA mice. Gli1 expression is suppressed by LPS/IFN-γ stimulation in Raw264.7 cells while being induced by RANKL stimulation in Raw264.7 cells. However, GANT58 suppressed LPS/IFN-ɣ -induced expression of inflammatory cytokines and iNOS and osteoclastogenesis. The authors also identified DNMT1 and DNMT3a as downstream effectors of Gli1. Transcriptomic analysis of GANT58 treated Raw264.7 cells identified diminished protein expression of DNMT1 and DNMT3a by GANT58. Gli1 also directly interacts with DNMT1. Intriguingly, DNMT1 overexpression restores the effect of GANT58 on LPS/IFN-ɣ-mediated activation, while DNMT3a overexpression reverses the effect of GANT58 on RANKL-induced osteoclastogenesis. Since this study defines the role of Gli1 in the function and differentiation of myeloid cells, this is interesting. In addition, GANT58 nearly completely protects mice from arthritis, suggesting a therapeutic potential of Gli1 targeting in RA. However, the details of experiments are not clearly described, and the authors present the mixed data from Raw264.7 cells and BMMs without any explanations.</p></disp-quote><p>Many thanks for your recognition and constructive comments on our research. In this study, used mouse macrophage-like cell line RAW264.7 and primary bone marrow-derived macrophages (BMMs). The RAW264.7 is the most commonly used mouse macrophage cell line in medical research, and it is one of the most commonly used in vitro models for osteoclasts and inflammation research. In addition, compared with cell lines, primary cells have the characteristics of unchanged genetic material and biological characteristics closer to cell physiology in vivo. Therefore, in addition to cell lines, we also extracted primary macrophages from bone marrow for experiments to improve the reliability of this study. According to your comments, we have revised the manuscript, and our point-by-point responses are shown as follows.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Major comments</p><p>Comment 1.

According to your suggestion, we have scored the results of H and E staining histologically and added quantitative results.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Comment 2. Pharmacological inhibitors often show non-specific effects. To complement their findings showing the effect of GANT58 on M1 macrophage activation and osteoclastogenesis, the authors should utilize Gli1-deficient cells that can be obtained by siRNAs-mediated knock down or Gli1 deletion.</p></disp-quote><p>Thanks for the professional and constructive comment. To make the results more reliable, we have synthesized siRNA and supplemented the related experiments to verify the role of GLI1 in M1 macrophage activation and osteoclastogenesis, which showed the same trend as GANT58 intervention. In the revised manuscript, the relevant results were shown in Figure S5:</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Comment 3.

According to the suggestion, we have added the RNA expression of DNMT1 and DAMT3a to the revised Figure 4. At the same time, the corresponding contents are also described in the Results part.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Comment 4. The authors should provide detailed information of RNA-seq including how many genes are regulated by GANT58 and what is their cutoff (fold induction and FDR). The authors should deposit their RNA seq data in the public databases repository such as GEO.</p></disp-quote><p>Thanks for the professional and constructive comment. In the revised manuscript, we have made a more detailed analysis of the sequencing results and the detail information of RNA-seq have been added in the supplementary information.</p><p>Revised in the manuscript:</p><p>“2.4. GLI1 regulates the expression of DNMTs in distinct ways during the different fates of macrophages</p><p>As a nuclear transcription factor, GLI1 exerts an active effect through nuclear entry. In order to explore the potential downstream regulation mechanism of GLI1, RNA sequencing (RNA-seq) on the macrophages before and after GLI1 intervention was performed then to observe gene expression changes. The seq data showed that more genes were down-regulated (143) than up-regulated (74) in GANT58 treated cells (Figure S7a, b). Among these differentially altered genes, we revealed through Gene Ontology (GO) analysis that GANT58's intervention in GLI1 affected multiple biological processes including macrophage chemotaxis and macrophage cytokine production (Figure 4a). What’s more, the results of the Kyoto Encyclopedia of Genes and Genomes (KEGG) enrichment analysis of the pathway team enrichment was then performed and we showed the TOP30 enriched pathway. In these pathways, we classified them into cellular processes (red), human diseases (blue) and organismal systems (green) respectively. It showed that these down-regulated genes were involved in the development of human diseases such as rheumatoid arthritis, as well as organismal systems such as osteoclast differentiation (Figure S8c; Figure 4b). These evidences confirmed our previous results. Specifically, GANT58 reduced some of the osteoclast and inflammation-related genes in the cell resting state.”</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Comment 5. Figure 5c. The authors should add non-stimulating condition as a control.</p></disp-quote><p>Thanks for your constructive comment. We have re-conducted the experiment and added the control group.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Comment 6. Figure 6C: DNMT3a deficiency regulates limited number of genes such as IRF8. The authors should measure IRF8 RNA or protein expression in RANKL-treated cells.</p></disp-quote><p>Thanks for your constructive comment. It is reported that DNMT3a can affect the activity of IRF8 and regulate the formation of osteoclasts. Thus, according to your suggestion, we have added IRF8 gene expression detection in the revised manuscript. As shown in Figure 6—figure supplement 1, the gene expression of <italic>Irf8</italic> was decreased after being treated by RANKL. However, the expression of Irf8 was reversed by Dnmt3a knock down.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Comment 7. Although the effects of Gli1 on bone metabolism in the literature are inconclusive, Gli1 is expressed on other cell types in bone. Gli1 haplodeficiency in mice decreased bone mass with reduced bone formation and enhanced bone resorption compared to control mice (PMID:25313900). Gli1 is also used as a marker for osteogenic progenitors which are precursors of chondrocytes and osteoblasts (PMID: 29230039). Thus, the beneficial effect of GANT58 on inflammation and bone erosion in CIA mice may result from the effects of GANT58 on multiple cell types other than F4/80+ cells. The authors should include these references in the discussion on pg.9 and expand their discussion.</p></disp-quote><p>Thank you for your constructive comments. Indeed. there have been some divergent conclusions about the function of hedgehog and GLI1 in bone metabolism, which suggests that GLI1 may have multiple roles. According to your suggestion, we have expanded the relevant discussion and added related references in the Discussion part.</p><p>Revised in the manuscript:</p><p>Discussion:</p><p>“Although we have demonstrated that the inhibition of GLI1 by GANT58 can reduce the inflammatory response and inhibit osteoclast formation and that this mechanism is achieved through the downregulation of DNMTs, these findings also raise new questions. In the previous research report, Gli1 haplodeficiency in mice decreased bone mass with reduced bone formation compared to control mice, which was due to the osteoblasts with weakened function [44]. In this process, the osteogenic differentiation of mesenchymal stem cells also affected the function of osteoclasts. In addition, GLI1 is also used as a marker for osteogenic progenitors which are precursors of chondrocytes and osteoblasts [45]. These studies suggest that the regulation of GLI1 on bone metabolism is complex, and the therapeutic effect of GANT58 on RA may be more than just affecting the inflammatory reaction mediated by macrophages and the bone destruction mediated by osteoclasts. In addition to macrophages and osteoclasts, the functions of synovial fibroblasts and osteoblasts play essential roles in the RA microenvironment. These cells are also closely linked to each other. Synovial fibroblasts OPG and RANKL secreted by osteoblasts are important factors that regulate osteoclasts. Therefore, in a follow-up study, we will extend the study of GLI1 to its regulatory mechanism in osteoblasts.”</p><p>Reference:</p><p>[44] Y. Kitaura, H. Hojo, Y. Komiyama, T. Takato, U.I. Chung, S.

Glioma-associated oncogene homolog 1 (GLI1) has been revealed to be closely linked to bone metabolism. In this study, GLI1-expression in synovial tissue of RA patients showed to be positively correlated with RA-related scores and was highly expressed in collagen-induced arthritis (CIA) mouse articular macrophage-like cells. The decreased expression and inhibition of nuclear transfer of GLI1 downregulated macrophage M1 polarization and osteoclast activation, the effect of which was achieved by modulation of DNA methyltransferases (DNMTs) via transcriptional regulation and protein interaction ways. By pharmacological inhibition of GLI1, the proportion of proinflammatory macrophages and the number of osteoclasts were significantly reduced, and the joint inflammatory response and bone destruction in CIA mice were alleviated. This study clarified the mechanism of GLI1 in macrophage phenotypic changes and activation of osteoclasts, suggesting potential applications of GLI1 inhibitor in the clinical treatment of RA.”</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Comment 3. Figure 4g, h: are these experiments done in the resting states?</p></disp-quote><p>Thank you for your comment. This part of the experiments was carried out during the induction of M1 macrophage or the induction of osteoclast. In this work, we found that GANT58 can inhibit GLI1 and at the same time reduce the gene expression of DNMT3a but not DNMT1 in the resting state. However, during M1 macrophage and osteoclast induction, GANT58 seemed to be able to inhibit both DNMT1 and DNMT3a protein expression. In view of the discovery that the expression of DNMT1 increased during the polarization of M1 macrophages, while the expression of DNMT3a increased during the activation of osteoclasts, we performed the binding experiment of GLI1 with DNMT1 in the process of LPS/IFN-γ induction, while the binding experiment with DNMT3a in the process of RANKL induction. We have added a detailed description to the revised manuscript.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Reviewer #1 (Significance (Required)):</p><p>Strengths: Hedgehog (hh) signaling has been implicated in the differentiation of osteogenic progenitors.

Inhibition of GLI1 by the GANT58 limited inflammation and destructive bone loss in a murine model of arthritis (Collagen Induced Arthritis). Inhibition of GLI1 increased expression of pro-inflammatory cytokines and M1 macrophage differentiation. Inhibition of GLI1 also blocked osteoclast formation. As has been shown in other settings, the function of GLI1 in M1 and osteoclast differentiation was linked to regulation by DNMTs.</p><p>Major comments:</p><p>Comment 1. There are several main problems with the text. Overall, the authors show an intriguing set of data implicating the use of GANT58 as a means to limit rheumatoid arthritis inflammation and bone destruction. The authors directly link the functions of GANT58 with loss of GLI1 activity by showing that GLI1 protein is reduced or translation to the nucleus blocked. It would be compelling if the authors would leverage a genetic model (either GLI1 knockout, or a CRISPR/siRNA approach) to see if it recapitulates key findings in vitro and in vivo. These data could further their claims that their findings are in fact directly due to GLI1.</p></disp-quote><p>Thanks for the professional and constructive comment. To make the results more reliable, we have synthesized siRNA and supplemented the related experiments to verify the role of GLI1 in M1 macrophage activation and osteoclastogenesis. Related experiments have been updated in the revised manuscript.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Comment 2. Overall, the paper lacks methodologic clarity that limits thorough interpretation of the data. Multiple experiments are missing from the Materials and methods, including descriptions of the definition of trabecular bone and its analysis in micro-CT, the means by which cytoplasmic and nuclear fractions were generated, and the timing and dosing of GANT58 in vitro studies. In addition, key details regarding the reagents include the sources of primary antibodies used in the western blots and immunoprecipitation studies. Important methodologies are not well explained, which include the treatment of the Sham animals (presumably healthy) are not explained, that is, whether they receive injections of vehicle or are truly naïve. Finally, there is no statistical methodology, minimal explanation of the RNA-sequencing analyses, and no statement about how the RNA-sequencing data will be made available. This lack of detail makes a thorough assessment of the quality and interpretations of the data challenging and replication of the results impossible.</p></disp-quote><p>Thanks for your careful reading and constructive comments. We are sorry for the lack of some detailed methodological descriptions in the manuscript.

Experimental animals and human synovial tissue. Male DBA mice aged 6-8 weeks and weighing 15-20 g were randomly selected and fed in a specific pathogen-free (SPF) environment at a room temperature of 25℃, a relative humidity of 60%, and 12 hours of alternating light. All animal experiments were approved by the Animal Ethics Committee of the Soochow University (201910A354). The animals were divided randomly into groups (6 per group): sham group (healthy mice not received any treatment), vehicle control group (CIA model mice treated with solvent), and GANT58 (GLI1 specific inhibitor; MedChemExpress, New Jersey, USA) group (mice treated with 20 mg/kg GANT58) or 5-AzaC (DNMTs specific inhibitor; MedChemExpress) group (mice treated with 2 mg/kg 5-AzaC). An emulsion of bovine type II collagen (Chondrex, Redmond, WA, USA) and an equal amount (1:1, v/v) of complete Freund’s adjuvant (Chondrex) was prepared to establish the CIA mouse model. First, 0.1 ml of the emulsion was injected intradermally into the base of the tail on day 0. On day 21, 0.1 mg of bovine type II collagen mixed with incomplete Freund’s adjuvant (Chondrex) was injected. For vehicle group, mice were injected with the same volume of placebo daily. For treatment groups, mice were injected with GANT58 or 5-AzaC solution daily. All interventions began the day after the second injection of bovine type II collagen. Arthritis score was given every three days from the second immunization. On day 49, all mice were sacrificed (in accordance with the guidelines of the Animal Welfare and Ethics Committee of the Soochow University) for the collection of specimens.”</p><p>“4.3. Micro-CT analysis. The fixed bone samples of mice were collected. The joint samples were placed in a SkyScan 1174 Micro-CT scanning warehouse (Belgium). The parameters were set as follows: voltage 50 kV, current 800 μA, scanning range 2 cm × 2 cm, and scanning layer thickness 8 μm. The scan data were then entered into computer to conduct three-dimensional reconstruction with NRecon software (Bruker, Germany), and the bone tissue parameters were analysed with CTAn software (Bruker, Germany) after data conversion. During this procedure, we performed an analysis of bone parameters including BMD (Bone Mineral Density), BV/TV (Percentage Trabecular Area), Tb.N (Trabecular Number) and Tb.Sp (Trabecular Separation) by selecting the small joint of paws as the region of interest (ROI) in CTAn software. The three-dimensional reconstruction images were exhibited by Mimics Research software (Version 21.0; Materialise, Belgium).”</p><p>“4.11. Western blotting. Cells were seeded in 6-well plates at a density of 1 × 10<sup>6</sup>/well with stimulation with RANKL (50 ng/ml) or LPS (100 ng/ml) + IFN-γ (20 ng/ml). First, cells were collected to extract total protein, and the BCA (Beyotime) method was used to adjust the protein concentration. Total protein was mixed with 5× loading buffer (Beyotime) and boiled at 95 °C for 10 minutes. For cytoplasmic/nucleus isolation, cells were collected and protein was extracted according to the instructions using the nuclear protein and cytoplasmic protein extraction kit (Beyotime). The proteins were separated by SDS polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis (SDS–PAGE; EpiZyme, Shanghai, China) based on their different molecular weights. Electrophoresis was performed using Bio–Rad (California, USA) equipment at 180 V for 40 minutes. Then, the proteins were transferred to a nitrocellulose membrane at 350 mA for 70 minutes using membrane transfer equipment (Bio–Rad). The membrane was removed and placed into western blot blocking buffer for 1 hour at room temperature. The diluted primary antibodies (GLI1, Abclonal, A14675; β-actin, Beyotime, AF5003; Lamin-B1, Abcam, ab16048; NFATc1, Abclonal, A1539; CTSK, Abclonal, A5871; MMP9, Abclonal, A11147; DNMT1, Abclonal, A16729; DNMT3a, Cell Signaling Technology, D23G1; GAPDH, Abclonal, A19056) were placed on the membrane and incubated at 4 ℃ for 12 hours, and then the corresponding secondary antibody was added and incubated for 1 hour at room temperature.

On the basis of these studies, small molecular compounds such as GANT58 (selective inhibitor of GLI1) and GANT61 (inhibitor of GLI1 and <italic>GLI2</italic>) are often used as pharmacological interventions of GLI1, so as to achieve the purpose of inhibiting GLI1 activity and regulating the molecular biological process [13, 14]. Many of the physiopathological processes involved with GLIs are complex and worth discussing. Relevant studies have shown that GLI1-activated transcription promotes the development of inflammatory diseases such as gastritis, and antagonizing GLI1 transcription can alleviate the inflammatory degradation of articular cartilage [15, 16].”</p><p>Discussion:</p><p>“In previous studies, GLI1 signal transduction and other pathways, including the NF-κB signaling pathway, were usually studied in tumor-associated diseases and are considered a response network that promotes cancer development [21, 22]. Qin. et al. found that the content of SHH in RA patients serum increased significantly by comparing with healthy patients [23]. At the same time, our study also showed that GLI1 was more expressed in the joint tissue of RA patients. These results suggest that HH-GLI signaling pathway may be involved in the regulation of the pathological process of RA. However, the research results of the hedgehog pathway in bone metabolism are complex.”</p><p>Reference:</p><p>[13] X. Chen, C. Shi, H. Cao, L. Chen, J. Hou, Z. Xiang, K. Hu, X.

As shown of the CCK8 result, GANT58 had no significant inhibitory effect neither on BMMs nor RAW264.7 cells until the concentration reached 40 μM. In the process of changing the polarization phenotype of macrophages, the cell morphology will also change to some extent. In our research results, the change of cell morphology after GANT58 intervention might be due to the inhibition of M1 macrophages. In order to observe the effect of GANT58 on BMM cell death and apoptosis, we further performed living/dead staining and apoptosis detection by fluorescence after GANT58 intervention. The results showed that GANT58 did not change the level of apoptosis nor increase the number of dead cells at the concentration of 10 μM. However, when the concentration increased to 30μM, the number of apoptotic cells increased.

In this study, it is interesting to find that GLI1 can affect the expression of <italic>Dnmt3a</italic> at the level of gene transcription, and affect the expression of DNMT3a and DNMT1 both in the process of protein expression. Through the CO-IP experiment, we confirmed that GLI1 protein can bind to DNMT1 instead of DNMT3a protein. These results suggested that GLI1 may regulate the expression of DNMT3a and DNMT1 at genetic level and post-translation proteinic level, respectively. Patricia Gonz á lez Rodr í Guez's latest research showed that during autophagy induction, GLI1 is upregulated, phosphorylated, translocated to the nucleus and recruited to the regions closer to the Transcription Start Site (TSS) of the <italic>Dnmt3a</italic> gene. This may be the direct mechanism of GLI1 regulating the expression of DNMT3a [1]. Theoretically, the expression of DNMTs affects the degree of methylation of related genes [2]. Thus, in the follow-up study, we will further verify the degree of genomic methylation caused by GLI1's regulation of DNMTs, and further explore more possible ways of GLI1's regulation of DNMTs and its potential role in other cell models.</p><p>Reference:</p><p>[1] P.

Osteoclast is defined as a multinucleated giant cell with bone absorption function, which is composed of multiple monocytes/macrophages [1]. As osteoclasts mature, their cytoskeleton will undergo drastic reorganization. Filamentous actin (F-actin) firstly constitutes a podosomes with a highly dynamic structure, thereby completing the cell adhesion, migration, dissolution of bone minerals and digestion of organic matrix [2]. Therefore, in addition to observing the formation of osteoclasts by TRAP staining, we also carried out immunofluorescence staining to observe the F-actin ring formation to further evaluate the functional maturity of osteoclasts. Osteoclasts usually have 2-50 nuclei, so we mainly regarded multinucleated giant cells with complete F-actin rings as mature osteoclasts during the quantification process.</p><p>Reference:</p><p>[1] da Costa CE, Annels NE, Faaij CM, Forsyth RG, Hogendoorn PC, Egeler RM, Presence of osteoclast-like multinucleated giant cells in the bone and nonostotic lesions of Langerhans cell histiocytosis.

Interesting data are presented whose novelty need better contextualization with other published studies, as previously published studies which are not cited in this manuscript include the finding that GLI1 is upregulated in patients with rheumatoid arthritis, that other GLI inhibitors have been utilized in murine models of rheumatoid arthritis, and that GLI1 has been shown to regulate DNMT expression in cancer settings.

The authors found that the GLI1 expression was elevated in RA synovial tissues and GLI1-specific inhibitor, GANT58, ameliorated arthritis in CIA mice. GLI1 expression in F4/80-positive macrophages in CIA synovial tissues led the authors to assess the roles of GLI1 in macrophages and osteoclasts. GANT58 suppressed M1 macrophage polarization by IFNγ+LPS and osteoclastogenesis by RANKL. RNA-seq analysis of GANT58-treated macrophages revealed that DNA methyltransferases, DNMT1 and DNMT3a were possible targets of GLI1, and the studies with small inhibitors or overexpression of DNMTs suggest that GLI1 enhanced M1 polarization and osteoclastogenesis through DNMTs. The manuscript is well-written, the methods are accurate, and the results and data interpretation are consistent and clearly presented. This work deserves publication in Research Commons after addressing the following questions:</p><p>Major comments</p><p>Comment 1. GANT58 may inhibit GLI2 in addition to GLI1 and have off-target effects.

In CIA with GANT58, the author performed only preventive treatment, not therapeutic treatment. Does GANT58 suppress adaptive immune responses via inhibiting APC function (ex. anti-CII IgG production)? Alternatively, the inhibitory effects of GANT58 on the effecter phase of RA (M1 macrophage and osteoclast activation) can be assessed using the serum-transfer arthritis models.</p></disp-quote><p>Many thanks for your constructive comments. Your question is indeed a direction worthy of attention. In our study, GANT58 was given during the stage of model establishment, showing a good effect of relieving arthritis, which was proved to come from the direct inhibition of inflammatory phenotype macrophages and osteoclasts. However, as autoimmune diseases, the enhancement of antigen presenting function and anti-Col II IgG production can enhance the immune response of the body [1]. The regulatory effect of GANT58 on macrophages suggests that it may have a potential impact on APC function. Despite this, whether GANT58 can regulate the pathological process of RA by influencing this pathway is inconclusive. Therefore, according to your suggestion, we will improve the relevant experiments in the follow-up research, and apply GANT58 to various animal models of RA to further explore the possible mechanism of GANT58 in the treatment of RA and provide more reliable theoretical support for its transformation and application.</p><p>Reference:</p><p>[1] Tsark EC, Wang W, Teng YC, Arkfeld D, Dodge GR, Kovats S, Differential MHC class II-mediated presentation of rheumatoid arthritis autoantigens by human dendritic cells and macrophages, J Immunol 1;169(11) (2002) 6625-33.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Minor comments</p><p>Comment 1.

In this work, GANT58 was ordered from MedChemExpress (MCE; Cat. No.: HY-13282) Company. According to the instructions for use, we prepared 20 mg/ml ethanol solution of GANT58 into 2 mg/ml working solution for injection in vivo according to the following ratio: 10% EtOH + 90% (20% SBE-β-CD in PBS); Clear solution; Need ultrasonic. During the experiment, GANT58 was injected i.p. at a dose of 20 mg/kg daily for 28 days. With regard to the choice of drug injection concentration, according to the previous literature, most studies used a dose of 50 mg/kg for daily injection [1, 2]. Hereby, we set up concentration gradient intervention (0, 10, 20, and 50 mg/kg) in the preliminary experiment and found that 20 and 50 both had good therapeutic effects.

In Figure 2 and 3, the treatment of macrophages with IFNγ+LPS and RANKL enhanced the nuclear translocation of GLI1, suggesting that these stimuli may activate hedgehog signals.

We agree with that the activation of GLI1 is regulated by many various pathways. According to your comment, we additionally used Cyclopamine, a selective inhibitor of SMO, to intervene during the polarization of M1 macrophages and the activation of osteoclasts. The results are as follows: Cyclopamine could also inhibit the pro-inflammatory polarization of macrophages to a certain extent, and a significant inhibition of the osteoclast formation could be observed as well. These results may further confirm the important role of HH/GLI1 in regulating macrophage caused inflammation and osteoclast activation.</p><fig id="sa2fig2" position="float"><label>Author response image 2.</label><caption><title>(a) Immunofluorescence staining of iNOS in RAW264.</title><p>7 cells during the stimulation by LPS/IFN-γ with or without 10 μM cyclopamine intervention and mean fluorescence intensity of the iNOS immunofluorescence.
