Moreover, UNC-43 regulates DAF-16 in response to various stress conditions, including starvation, heat or oxidative stress, and cooperatively contributes to lifespan regulation by insulin signaling. However, unlike insulin signaling, UNC-43 phosphorylates and activates DAF-16, thus promoting its nuclear localization. The phosphorylation of DAF-16 at S286 by UNC-43 is removed by TAX-6•CNB-1, leading to DAF-16 inactivation. Mammalian FOXO3 is also regulated by CAMKIIA and Calcineurin.</p><p><bold>DOI:</bold> <ext-link ext-link-type="doi" xlink:href="10.7554/eLife.00518.001">http://dx.doi.org/10.7554/eLife.00518.001</ext-link></p></abstract><abstract abstract-type="executive-summary"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.00518.002</object-id><title>eLife digest</title><p>Although aging might seem to be a passive process—resulting simply from wear and tear over a lifetime—it can actually be accelerated or slowed down by genetic mutations. This phenomenon has been most thoroughly studied in the nematode worm, <italic>Caenorhabditis elegans</italic>. Normally, this worm lives for just two or three weeks, but genetic mutations that reduce the activity of certain enzymes in a series of biochemical reactions known as the insulin/IGF-1 signalling pathway can extend its lifespan by up to a factor of ten, and similar effects have been seen in flies and mice. Lifespans can also be increased by blocking other signalling pathways or restricting the intake of calories.</p><p>This increase in lifespan associated with the insulin/IGF-1 signalling pathway is known to involve a protein called DAF-16 and two kinases called AKT-1 and AKT-2. Under normal conditions the AKT kinases add several phosphate groups to the DAF-16, which prevents it from travelling to the nucleus of the cell. However, when genetic techniques are used to block the insulin/IGF-1 signalling pathway, the AKT kinases are unable to add the phosphate groups; this leaves the DAF-16 free to enter the nucleus, where it activates a network of genes that promotes longevity.</p><p>In addition to kinases, the insulin/IGF-1 signalling pathway also involves enzymes called phosphatases that remove the phosphate groups from other proteins. In particular, a phosphatase called calcineurin is known to be involved in the regulation of lifespan, but the details of this process are not fully understood.</p><p>Now, Tao et al. have carried out a series of genetic and biochemical experiments to determine how phosphatases exert their influence on aging. The results show that calcineurin targets DAF-16, the same protein that is targeted by the AKT kinases. Moreover, another kinase also targets DAF-16 when the worm is exposed to heat, starvation or some other form of stress: this kinase, which is not involved in the insulin/IGF-1 signalling pathway, is called CAMKII.</p><p>Tao et al. show that these kinases act on DAF-16 in different ways: CAMKII activates it by adding the phosphate group at a specific site known as S286, whereas the AKT kinases deactivate DAF-16 because they add phosphate groups at different sites, thereby preventing it from entering the nucleus<bold>.</bold> Calcineurin neutralizes the effect of CAMKII by removing the phosphate group at S286 to deactivate the DAF-16.</p><p>In addition to shedding new light on the regulation of lifespan in <italic>C. elegans</italic>, the new results could improve our understanding of aging in humans, and also the development of diabetes and other age-related diseases, because the equivalent molecules in mammalian cells are regulated in similar ways.</p><p><bold>DOI:</bold> <ext-link ext-link-type="doi" xlink:href="10.7554/eLife.00518.002">http://dx.doi.org/10.7554/eLife.00518.002</ext-link></p></abstract><kwd-group kwd-group-type="author-keywords"><title>Author keywords</title><kwd>aging</kwd><kwd>lifespan</kwd><kwd>FOXO</kwd><kwd>CAMKII</kwd><kwd>calcineurin</kwd><kwd>DAF-16</kwd></kwd-group><kwd-group kwd-group-type="research-organism"><title>Research organism</title><kwd><italic>C. elegans</italic></kwd></kwd-group><funding-group><award-group id="par-1"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution>The Ministry of Science and Technology of China</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>863-2007AA02Z1A7, 973-2010CB835203</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Dong</surname><given-names>Meng-Qiu</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="par-2"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution>The Ministry of Science and Technology of China</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>973-2009CB918704, 973-2012CB910701</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Yuan</surname><given-names>Zengqiang</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="par-3"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution>National Science Foundation of China</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>30870792, 81030025, 81125010</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Yuan</surname><given-names>Zengqiang</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="par-4"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution>The municipal government of Beijing</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Dong</surname><given-names>Meng-Qiu</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><funding-statement>The funders had no role in study design, data collection and interpretation, or the decision to submit the work for publication.</funding-statement></funding-group><custom-meta-group><custom-meta specific-use="meta-only"><meta-name>Author impact statement</meta-name><meta-value>Longevity in <italic>C. elegans</italic> is influenced not only by insulin/IGF-1 signalling, but also by CAMKII and calcineurin, acting on the same target, the transcription factor DAF-16.</meta-value></custom-meta></custom-meta-group></article-meta></front><body><sec id="s1" sec-type="intro"><title>Introduction</title><p>Multiple signaling pathways, including insulin/IGF-1 signaling (IIS), germline signaling, mitochondrial signaling, and the signaling pathways induced by dietary restriction, regulate aging in <italic>C. elegans</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Kenyon, 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Greer and Brunet, 2008</xref>). The best characterized is the IIS pathway, which includes the upstream insulin/IGF-1 receptor DAF-2 and the downstream FOXO transcription factor DAF-16. Signals from DAF-2 are transmitted through AGE-1 (phosphoinositide 3-kinase) and PDK-1 (phosphoinositol-dependent kinase-1) to AKT-1, AKT-2, and SGK-1, which phosphorylate DAF-16 and prevent it from translocating to the nucleus to activate a pro-longevity gene network. Reduction-of-function mutations of the kinase genes in the IIS pathway, from <italic>daf-2</italic> to <italic>akt-1</italic>, <italic>akt-2,</italic> and <italic>sgk-1</italic>, all extend lifespan in a <italic>daf-16</italic>-dependent manner (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Kenyon et al., 1993</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">Morris et al., 1996</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Kimura et al., 1997</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Hertweck et al., 2004</xref>). Lifespan extension by reduced IIS is also observed in other species, including flies and mice, indicating that the pathway is conserved evolutionarily (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Kenyon, 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Greer and Brunet, 2008</xref>).</p><p>Compared with the kinases in the <italic>C. elegans</italic> IIS pathway, little is known about the protein phosphatases that neutralize the effects of the kinases. The only known example is PPTR-1, a B56 regulatory subunit of PP2A, which directs PP2A to dephosphorylate AKT-1 at T350, thereby inactivating the kinase (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib41">Padmanabhan et al., 2009</xref>). DAF-18, the <italic>C. elegans</italic> PTEN, is a phosphatidylinositol 3,4,5-trisphosphate (PIP3) 3-phosphatase (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">Ogg and Ruvkun, 1998</xref>). The phosphatase for DAF-2 has not been identified, nor the one that regulates DAF-16. Previously, <italic>loss-of-function (lf)</italic> mutants for <italic>tax-6</italic> and <italic>cnb-1</italic>, which encode the catalytic and regulatory subunits of <italic>C. elegans</italic> Calcineurin, respectively, were found to live longer than wild-type (WT) worms (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Dong et al., 2007</xref>). In mammalian systems, Calcineurin (PP2B) is a Ca<sup>2+</sup>/calmodulin-dependent serine/threonine protein phosphatase that has diverse functions and affects both T cell activation and heart development (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Crabtree, 1999</xref>). In <italic>C. elegans</italic>, Calcineurin regulates body size, thermotaxis, muscle contraction, and lifespan (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Bandyopadhyay et al., 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Kuhara et al., 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Lee et al., 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Dong et al., 2007</xref>). The longevity phenotype of <italic>tax-6(lf)</italic> is partially dependent on <italic>daf-16</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Dong et al., 2007</xref>). More recent studies have shown that <italic>C. elegans</italic> Calcineurin can regulate lifespan by suppressing autophagy (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Dwivedi et al., 2009</xref>) or inactivating CRTC-1, a co-activator of CREB (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Mair et al., 2011</xref>). However, direct targets of worm Calcineurin have not been identified.</p><p>In the current work, we addressed how worm Calcineurin TAX-6•CNB-1 regulates lifespan. We discovered that DAF-16 was phosphorylated and activated by UNC-43 at the serine 286 (S286) site. The phosphoryl group was removed by TAX-6•CNB-1. UNC-43 and TAX-6•CNB-1 therefore regulate <italic>C. elegans</italic> lifespan through the reversible phosphorylation of DAF-16. This regulatory mechanism has a different mode of action from the canonical IIS pathway because the phosphorylation activates, rather than represses, DAF-16. Activation of DAF-16 by UNC-43 occurs in response to different types of stress signals, such as heat, starvation, and oxidation. UNC-43 and TAX-6•CNB-1 can regulate DAF-16 independently of IIS, and the two signaling mechanisms appear to crosstalk, leading to coordinated action on DAF-16. We also show that the regulation of FOXO by CAMKII and Calcineurin is conserved in mammalian cells.</p></sec><sec id="s2" sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><sec id="s2-1"><title>TAX-6 interacts with DAF-16 in vitro and in vivo</title><p>A genetic analysis has shown that a <italic>daf-16(null)</italic> allele partially suppresses the longevity of the <italic>tax-6(lf)</italic> mutant (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Dong et al., 2007</xref>). This observation suggested that <italic>daf-16</italic> is either a direct or indirect downstream target of <italic>C. elegans</italic> Calcineurin; alternatively, it acts independently. To sort through these possibilities, we immunoprecipitated the 3xFLAG::DAF-16 protein using an anti-FLAG antibody from the lysate of MQD82, a transgenic worm strain that expresses this fusion protein and TAX-6::GFP (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1A</xref>, lane 1). TAX-6::GFP from this lysate was co-precipitated with the FLAG antibody (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1A</xref>, lane 4), but no TAX-6::GFP was co-precipitated from the lysate of MQD2, a strain expressing only TAX-6::GFP (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1A</xref>, lanes 2 and 5). From the mixed lysates of two other transgenic strains, one expressing 3xFLAG::DAF-16 and the other expressing GFP, the GFP protein also failed to be precipitated by the FLAG antibody (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1A</xref>, lanes 3 and 6). This result suggested that TAX-6 and DAF-16 interacted with each other in vivo. To determine whether the interaction was direct, we individually purified the recombinant His-tagged DAF-16 and <italic>C. elegans</italic> Calcineurin in the form of TAX-6•GST-CNB-1 and then mixed them together before pulling down DAF-16 with nickel beads. Indeed, TAX-6•GST-CNB-1 was pulled down successfully using His-tagged DAF-16 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1B</xref>). Further analysis suggested that the C-terminal region of DAF-16 mediates the interaction with Calcineurin (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1C</xref>).

Therefore, UNC-43 and TAX-6•CNB-1 most likely respond to conditions that are distinct from the conditions sensed by AKT in the IIS pathway. In addition to mutations that reduce insulin signaling, various stress conditions, including thermal stress, oxidative stress, and starvation, can trigger translocation of DAF-16 to the nucleus (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Henderson and Johnson, 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">Lin et al., 2001</xref>).

These two pathways, however, also seem to crosstalk.

Second, in the constitutively active <italic>unc-43(gf)</italic> mutant, which has increased phosphorylation on DAF-16 S286 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5D</xref>), phosphorylation by AKT on T240 is greatly reduced (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5E</xref>). Therefore, in long-lived <italic>unc-43(gf)</italic> animals, phosphorylation on these two residues appears to be coordinated, but it is unclear how this coordination occurs. The AKT kinase activity may be reduced in <italic>unc-43(gf)</italic>, or phospho-S286 DAF-16 may be a poor substrate for AKT. In either case, dampened phosphorylation on the AKT site may be expected to prevent DAF-16 from forming a complex with the 14-3-3 protein, which has been shown to bind to and sequester AKT-phosphorylated FOXO (DAF-16 or mammalian FOXO3) in the cytoplasm (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Brunet et al., 1999</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Berdichevsky et al., 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Li et al., 2007</xref>).

Using a luciferase reporter assay, we found that the transcriptional activity of FOXO3 was indeed stimulated by CAMKIIA in a way that required S298 of FOXO3 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig10">Figure 10A</xref>) and T286 of CAMKIIA (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig10">Figure 10B</xref>), and further enhanced by the constitutively active CAMKIIA mutant (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig10">Figure 10C</xref>). Consistently, expression of Calcineurin significantly inhibited the transcriptional activity of FOXO3 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig10">Figure 10D</xref>). From these results, we conclude that CAMKIIA and Calcineurin oppose each other in regulating the transcriptional activity of mouse FOXO3 through phosphorylation or dephosphorylation at S298.

The direct, antagonistic nature of these two enzymes also raised an interesting possibility that, with their opposing effects on DAF-16 and a common activating signal (Ca<sup>2+</sup>/CAM), UNC-43 and TAX-6•CNB-1 would constitutively negate each other and have essentially no control of DAF-16. However, this outcome most likely does not occur because of the difference in the spatial distribution and temporal activation profiles of the two enzymes. TAX-6 and CNB-1, similar to DAF-16, are expressed in most cells in <italic>C. elegans</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">Ogg et al., 1997</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Bandyopadhyay et al., 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Kuhara et al., 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Dong et al., 2007</xref>). In contrast, <italic>unc-43</italic> promoter-driven GFP was only detected in neurons and the intestine (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Hunt-Newbury et al., 2007</xref>). We also detected UNC-43 primarily in the nervous system (not shown).</p><p>At the subcellular level, the TAX-6::GFP fusion protein is distributed diffusely throughout the cytoplasm and inside the nucleus (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Kuhara et al., 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Dong et al., 2007</xref>). In contrast, the CFP::UNC-43 fusion protein is concentrated on perinuclear structures and clusters in neurites (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib47">Umemura et al., 2005</xref>). Temporally, Ca<sup>2+</sup>-activated CAMKII phosphorylates another molecule of CAMKII at T286 to convert it to a Ca<sup>2+</sup>/CAM-independent kinase, prolonging the kinase activity after the initial activation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Erickson et al., 2011</xref>). CAMKII can also be activated by ROS at low Ca<sup>2+</sup> concentrations (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Erickson et al., 2011</xref>). In mammalian cells, inhibition of Calcineurin by cytoplasmic CAMKII and inhibition of CAMKII by Calcineurin have both been reported (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">MacDonnell et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Kubokawa et al., 2011</xref>), suggesting that the balance is intricately maintained. Therefore, in the case of the simultaneous activation of CAMKII and Calcineurin by Ca<sup>2+</sup>/CAM, either the kinase or the phosphatase could dominate the regulation of DAF-16 either locally (e.g., cytoplasm vs nucleus) or for certain time windows. This balance likely fine-tunes the DAF-16 activity in response to a changing environment.</p></sec><sec id="s3-2"><title>CAMKII responds to a variety of stress signals</title><p>It is likely that UNC-43/Calcineurin is responsible for activating DAF-16 when worms experience a variety of stress signals, including heat stress, oxidative stress, or prolonged starvation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6G</xref>). Food deprivation acts through UNC-43 to suppress spontaneous sex-muscle contraction in <italic>C. elegans</italic> males (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">LeBoeuf et al., 2007</xref>). Reported in HEK293T cells, human FOXO3 is phosphorylated at non-AKT sites under stress conditions such as heat shock or H<sub>2</sub>O<sub>2</sub> treatment (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Brunet et al., 2004</xref>). ROS-induced oxidation of two methionine residues activates CAMKII, and this activation can occur under conditions of low Ca<sup>2+</sup> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Erickson et al., 2011</xref>). Thus, CAMKII is perfectly equipped to transmit ROS signaling and calcium signaling, and phosphorylation of FOXO3 by CAMKII may play a highly conserved role in the stress response, from worms to humans.</p></sec><sec id="s3-3"><title>Daf-16 is not the only substrate of worm Calcineurin that regulates lifespan</title><p>To date, DAF-16 is the only biochemically and genetically proven substrate of TAX-6•CNB-1, but it is not the only substrate involved in lifespan regulation by Calcineurin.

In light of this work, we propose that sustained activation of FOXO3 resulting from chronic inhibition of Calcineurin may cause NODM in transplant patients.

Your article has been favorably evaluated by a Senior editor and 3 reviewers, one of whom is a member of our Board of Reviewing Editors.</p><p>The Reviewing editor and the other reviewers discussed their comments before we reached this decision, and the Reviewing editor has assembled the following comments to help you prepare a revised submission.</p><p>This paper is of substantial interest based on data revealing novel interactions between <italic>daf-16</italic> in <italic>C. elegans</italic> and the orthologs of calcineurin and CamKII, powerful regulators in the mammalian immune system as well as metabolism. The data strongly support the authors’ hypothesis that <italic>daf-16</italic> function is positively regulated by phosphorylation by the latter and negatively regulated by dephosphorylation of the former. Furthermore, stress responses appear to be mediated by this system in controlling life span in worms. However, recent data published by Ozcan et al (cited in the present paper but not discussed in sufficient detail) have revealed phosphorylation of FOXO by CamKII, nuclear translocation, and phospho sites that are distinct from AKT sites, so these findings are not completely novel. Nonetheless, this paper extends our information substantially and the impact would be even further strengthened with extension of the findings into a mammalian system. Major concerns are noted below:</p><p>1) All the data presented related to phosphorylation/dephosphorylation have been produced through the use of expressed tagged constructs. None of the conclusions are supported by isolations of the endogenous proteins. Although the bulk of the claims based on biochemical analysis are well supported by genetic studies, direct evidence of interactions and covalent modification of endogenous proteins would strengthen the paper. It is suggested, but not required, that the authors consider using antibodies against the endogenous proteins to confirm their data.</p><p>2) The T240 site does not appear to be regulated, although again these relevant data are from expressed tagged proteins. There are no genetic studies for this site provided, which would strengthen the concept that this site is not involved.</p><p>3) The conclusions of the paper would be substantively extended and the impact strengthened if the authors could provide evidence that this site of S286 of regulation of FOXO protein in mouse and human were operational. Good reagents are available for such studies, which would be easy to do in terms of both demonstrating phosphorylation/dephosphorylation as well as nuclear/cytoplasmic localization. In this regard, even though S286 is conserved in FOXO3, S303 in FOXO1, the equivalent of S299 in FOXO3, was not identified as a site whose phosphorylation was increased by CaMKIIg by Ozcan et al., and most of the reported sites were in Ser-Pro motifs, possibly phosphorylated as a result of p38 activation.</p><p>4) The sequence around DAF-16 S286(SIQTISHDLYD) is not that of a typical site for phosphorylation by CaMKII, which is a basophilic kinase, and is not predicted by Scansite to be a CaMKII site, even at low stringency, despite the authors’ in vitro evidence that CaMKII can directly phosphorylate S286. All the mapped CaMKII sites listed in <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://www.phosphosite.org/substrateSearchViewAction.do?id=964&amp;type=Protein">PhosphoSitePlus</ext-link> that have a D at +2 also have an Arg or Lys at −3, which is not the case for S286. This deserves discussion and raises the issue of whether CaMKII directly phosphorylates DAF-16 in vivo.</p><p>5) Given the focus of the field to date on AKT regulation of FOXOs, the effect of the S286 phos status on the AKT site is very interesting. The submission goes some way to determining dominance between these two regulatory mechanisms (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7</xref>), but it would benefit from going further in terms of the effects on aging. Does a S286A mutation or <italic>unc-43</italic> null inhibit the longevity effects of DAF-2 or AKT loss of function: i.e., is phos of S286 necessary for lifespan extension by FOXO, rather than sufficient?</p><p>6) How does TAX-6/CNB-1 bind DAF-16 (i.e., what are the interaction domains in the two proteins?)?</p><p>7) How does phosphorylation of S286 promote nuclear import of DAF-16 (e.g., does it reduce 14-3-3 binding?)?</p></body></sub-article><sub-article article-type="reply" id="SA2"><front-stub><article-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.00518.029</article-id><title-group><article-title>Author response</article-title></title-group></front-stub><body><p><italic>1) All the data presented related to phosphorylation/dephosphorylation have been produced through the use of expressed tagged constructs.

It is suggested, but not required, that the authors consider using antibodies against the endogenous proteins to confirm their data</italic>.</p><p>We agree with the reviewers wholeheartedly. We have tried from an early phase of this research to detect interactions and modifications of endogenous proteins. However, none of the antibodies we made (three for DAF-16, two for TAX-6, and two for UNC-43) are good enough for IP or WB of the endogenous proteins. We have a tiny bit of TAX-6 antiserum from Dr. Joohong Ahnn that can detect endogenous TAX-6, but it doesn’t work for IP. Using this antibody we did not see endogenous TAX-6 in the DAF-16::GFP IP.</p><p><italic>2) The T240 site does not appear to be regulated, although again these relevant data are from expressed tagged proteins. There are no genetic studies for this site provided, which would strengthen the concept that this site is not involved</italic>.</p><p>In the revised manuscript we provide genetic results further bolstering the conclusion that T240 is not phosphorylated by UNC-43. This is shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6s1">Figure 6—figure supplement 1</xref>. If T240 phosphorylation mediates the effect of UNC-43, the T240A mutation should abolish DAF-16 nuclear accumulation. However, DAF-16(T240A) accumulated in the nucleus, even in an essentially WT background. This is consistent with T240 being an AKT phosphorylation site, not an UNC-43 phosphorylation site. The phenotype of DAF-16(T240A-S286A) is complex, but mostly mimicking a strong loss-of-AKT phenotype. This result again agrees with T240 being an AKT phosphorylation site and echoes with the other data shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8">Figure 8</xref>, suggesting that insulin signaling overpowers UNC-43 signaling when in conflict. Lastly, DAF-16(T240A) has no effect on lifespan (below in Author response image 1), resembling DAF-16(4AM), in which four AKT consensus phosphorylation sites are all mutated to alanine (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">Lin et al., 2001</xref> Nat. Gen. and Lee et al., 2001 Curr. Biol.).<fig id="fig11" position="float"><graphic xlink:href="elife-00518-resp-fig1-v1"/></fig></p><p><italic>3) The conclusions of the paper would be substantively extended and the impact strengthened if the authors could provide evidence that this site of S286 of regulation of FOXO protein in mouse and human were operational. Good reagents are available for such studies, which would be easy to do in terms of both demonstrating phosphorylation/dephosphorylation as well as nuclear/cytoplasmic localization. In this regard, even though S286 is conserved in FOXO3, S303 in FOXO1, the equivalent of S299 in FOXO3, was not identified as a site whose phosphorylation was increased by CaMKIIg by Ozcan et al., and most of the reported sites were in Ser-Pro motifs, possibly phosphorylated as a result of p38 activation</italic>.</p><p>We have added mammalian data (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig9">Figure 9</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig10">Figure 10</xref>) to the manuscript. Indeed, mammalian CAMKIIA and Calcineurin regulate FOXO3 phosphorylation at the same conserved site as DAF-16 S286, which is S298 in mouse FOXO3 (equivalent to S299 in human FOXO3). This regulation appears to be limited to FOXO3; phosphorylation of the equivalent site in FOXO1 by CAMKIIA was not detected. The FOXO1 results are summarized in the following paragraph, which is added to the paper under the section title “Mammalian CAMKII and Calcineurin also regulate phosphorylation of mouse FOXO3 at a conserved serine residue”:</p><p>“A recent study by Ozcan et al. shows that four non-AKT phosphorylation sites are involved in the activation of murine FOXO1 by CAMKIIγ, likely through the p38 MAP kinase, in glucagon-stimulated hepatocytes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib40">Ozcan et al., 2012</xref>). Serine 300 of mouse FOXO1, the equivalent of S298 of mouse FOXO3, is not among them (S246, S295, S467, and S475). To find out whether the CAMKIIA isoform phosphorylates FOXO1 in the same way as it does FOXO3, we expressed a FLAG-tagged human FOXO1 in HEK293T cells co-transfected or not with CAMKIIA. Mass spec analysis identified three CAMKIIA-regulated phosphorylation sites equivalent to mouse FOXO1 S295, S467, and S475 (not shown). This agrees with the findings by Ozcan <italic>et al</italic>. and suggests that CAMKII directly phosphorylates FOXO3 but not FOXO1 in mammals.”</p><p><italic>4) The sequence around DAF-16 S286(SIQTISHDLYD) is not that of a typical site for phosphorylation by CaMKII, which is a basophilic kinase, and is not predicted by Scansite to be a CaMKII site, even at low stringency, despite the authors’ in vitro evidence that CaMKII can directly phosphorylate S286. All the mapped CaMKII sites listed in <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://www.phosphosite.org/substrateSearchViewAction.do?id=964&amp;type=Protein">PhosphoSitePlus</ext-link> that have a D at +2 also have an Arg or Lys at −3, which is not the case for S286. This deserves discussion and raises the issue of whether CaMKII directly phosphorylates DAF-16 in vivo</italic>.</p><p>Indeed, DAF-16 S286 is not a typical CAMKII site. However, it has been reported that CAMKII can phosphorylate Ser or Thr residue within the sequence motif S/TXD (Yamauchi, 2005, Biol Pharm Bull.). DAF-16 S286 is found within such a motif, as is mFOXO3 S298 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig9">Figure 9A</xref>). We found many examples among the mapped CAMKII sites from the PhosphoSite web page, where D at +2 is not accompanied by a K/R at -3. Below are some of them copied from <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://www.phosphosite.org/substrateSearchViewAction.do?id=964&amp;type=Protein">PhosphoSitePlus</ext-link> (Author response image 2):<fig id="fig12" position="float"><graphic xlink:href="elife-00518-resp-fig2-v1"/></fig></p><p><italic>5) Given the focus of the field to date on AKT regulation of FOXOs, the effect of the S286 phos status on the AKT site is very interesting. The submission goes some way to determining dominance between these two regulatory mechanisms (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7</xref>), but it would benefit from going further in terms of the effects on aging. Does a S286A mutation or</italic> unc-43 <italic>null inhibit the longevity effects of DAF-2 or AKT loss of function: i.e., is phos of S286 necessary for lifespan extension by FOXO, rather than sufficient</italic>?</p><p>Yes, the relationship between insulin signaling and CAMKII signaling is very interesting. We found that <italic>unc-43(null)</italic> significantly shortened the lifespan of <italic>daf-2(e1370)</italic> by 31%, suggesting that UNC-43 transmits part of the signaling from DAF-2 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7C</xref>). However, the S286A mutation appeared to have no effect on lifespan extension by <italic>daf-2</italic> RNAi (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7s1">Figure 7—figure supplement 1</xref>). We think that additional UNC-43 targets are involved in DAF-2 signaling.</p><p><italic>6) How does TAX-6/CNB-1 bind DAF-16 (i.e., what are the interaction domains in the two proteins?)</italic>?</p><p>We performed pull-down assays with GST-tagged DAF-16 fragments and found that the C-terminal region of DAF-16 is important for TAX-6 binding. This is added as <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1C</xref>. The C-terminal region harbors the regulatory site S286.</p><p><italic>7) How does phosphorylation of S286 promote nuclear import of DAF-16 (e.g., does it reduce 14-3-3 binding?)</italic>?</p><p>This is a very good question but unfortunately we are not able to answer it definitively. We found that <italic>unc-43(gf)</italic> increased phosphorylation at S286 and decreased phosphorylation at T240 on DAF-16 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5D–E</xref>), and this was indeed accompanied by a reduction of DAF-16-associated 14-3-3, as suspected by the reviewers (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7s2">Figure 7—figure supplement 2</xref>). However, there are two possibilities for the negative correlation between S286 phosphorylation and T240 phosphorylation: AKT activity may be reduced in <italic>unc-43(gf),</italic> or phospho-S286 DAF-16 may be a poor substrate for AKT. Either would explain the reduction of T240 phosphorylation and 14-3-3 binding. If we had integrated strains of DAF-16(S286D)::6xHisGFP, we might have had a better chance to address this question by GFP IP and 14-3-3 WB, and finding out whether the S286D mutation reduces T240 phosphorylation. In any case, it remains to be determined whether S286 phosphorylation directly interferes with 14-3-3 binding or through reduced T240 phosphorylation.</p></body></sub-article></article>
