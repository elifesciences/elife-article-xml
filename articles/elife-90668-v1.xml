community-associated methicillin-resistant <italic>S. aureus</italic> USA300 strains to hospital-associated (HA-MRSA) USA500 strains and ancestral methicillin-susceptible (MSSA) strains. This phenotypic distribution within a single clonal complex makes CC8 an ideal clade to study the emergence of mutations important for antibiotic resistance and community spread. Gene-level analysis comparing USA300 against MSSA and HA-MRSA strains have revealed key horizontally acquired genes important for its rapid spread in the community. However, efforts to define the contributions of point mutations and indels have been confounded by strong linkage disequilibrium resulting from clonal propagation. To break down this confounding effect, we combined genetic association testing with a model of the transcriptional regulatory network (TRN) to find candidate mutations that may have led to changes in gene regulation. First, we used a De Bruijn graph genome-wide association study to enrich mutations unique to the USA300 lineages within CC8. Next, we reconstructed the TRN by using independent component analysis on 670 RNA-sequencing samples from USA300 and non-USA300 CC8 strains which predicted several genes with strain-specific altered expression patterns. Examination of the regulatory region of one of the genes enriched by both approaches, <italic>isdH</italic>, revealed a 38-bp deletion containing a Fur-binding site and a conserved single-nucleotide polymorphism which likely led to the altered expression levels in USA300 strains. Taken together, our results demonstrate the utility of reconstructed TRNs to address the limits of genetic approaches when studying emerging pathogenic strains.</p></abstract><kwd-group kwd-group-type="author-keywords"><kwd>transcriptional regulatory network</kwd><kwd>GWAS</kwd><kwd>independent component analysis</kwd><kwd><italic>Staphylococcus aureus</italic></kwd></kwd-group><kwd-group kwd-group-type="research-organism"><title>Research organism</title><kwd>Other</kwd></kwd-group><funding-group><award-group id="fund1"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000060</institution-id><institution>National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>AI124316</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Poudel</surname><given-names>Saugat</given-names></name><name><surname>Hyun</surname><given-names>Jason</given-names></name><name><surname>Hefner</surname><given-names>Ying</given-names></name><name><surname>Monk</surname><given-names>Jon</given-names></name><name><surname>Nizet</surname><given-names>Victor</given-names></name><name><surname>Palsson</surname><given-names>Bernhard O</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><funding-statement>The funders had no role in study design, data collection, and interpretation, or the decision to submit the work for publication.</funding-statement></funding-group><custom-meta-group><custom-meta specific-use="meta-only"><meta-name>Author impact statement</meta-name><meta-value>Transcriptional regulatory network models can aid in identifying candidate genes associated with the target phenotype in bacterial genome-wide association studies.</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta specific-use="meta-only"><meta-name>publishing-route</meta-name><meta-value>prc</meta-value></custom-meta></custom-meta-group></article-meta></front><body><sec id="s1" sec-type="intro"><title>Introduction</title><p>Comparative genomic methods represent an important approach to understand the emergence and evolution of new strains of pathogens. In <italic>Staphylococcus aureus</italic> alone, whole-genome comparisons have enabled rapid characterization of genetic basis for antibiotic resistance, increased virulence, host specificity, and altered metabolic capabilities (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib59">Young et al., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Bosi et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Choudhary et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Correction for Copin, 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">Krishna et al., 2018</xref>). However, genome-wide linkage disequilibrium and strong population structure currently limit the differentiation of causative alleles from genetically linked ones. By calculating lineage level associations, methods like bugwas address these issues for single, recurring phenotypes like antibiotic resistance (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Earle et al., 2016</xref>).</p><p>Emerging clonal complexes, on the other hand, exhibit multiple complex phenotypes that may contribute to their emergence and proliferation. For example, USA300 strains carry antibiotic resistance cassettes, Panton–Valentine Leukocidin (PVL) associated with pyogenic skin infections, increased ability to colonize locations outside of the nasopharynx, etc. (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib59">Young et al., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Diep et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Faden et al., 2010</xref>). As these strains often emerge clonally from closely related ‘ancestral strains’, efforts to discern causal mutations that lead to their increased clinical burden is hampered by strong population-stratification and genome-wide linkage disequilibrium (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib53">Steinig et al., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Challagundla et al., 2018b</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Bal et al., 2016</xref>). Though recombination at species level is common in <italic>S. aureus</italic>, within clade recombination rates tend to be lower, thus preserving the linkage between mutations (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Challagundla et al., 2018b</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib56">Uhlemann et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Challagundla et al., 2018a</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Everitt et al., 2014</xref>). Due to this limitation, studies of emerging strains often focus on gene-level analysis such as acquisition of mobile genetic elements or loss of gene function as their effect on phenotype is easier to determine than that of point mutations (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib55">Thurlow et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Boyle-Vavra et al., 2015</xref>). Computational modeling methods can help tackle these challenges by predicting phenotype differences between strains, thus acting as a sieve to filter enriched mutations with potential phenotypic effects and therefore find candidate causal mutations (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib43">Nishizaki et al., 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Choi et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">Kavvas et al., 2020</xref>). Even if experimentally intractable, the large possible phenotypic space of an organism can be explored quickly with computational models. Taking advantage of these modeling techniques, we use a reconstruction of the transcriptional regulatory network (TRN) of clonal complex 8 (CC8) strains to find USA300-specific mutations that are associated with changes in gene regulation.</p><p>First, we used De Bruijn graph genome-wide association study (DBGWAS) to discover enriched mutations associated with the USA300 strain within CC8 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Jaillard et al., 2018</xref>). Due to clonal expansion of USA300 strains from their progenitors within CC8, the enriched USA300-specific mutations were in high linkage disequilibrium. Further complicating the matter, we found that almost all mutations enriched within open reading frames (ORFs) were unique to USA300 lineage and not found in any other clonal complexes, precluding identification of potential causative mutations by homoplasy. Instead, we turned to reconstruction of a TRN to identify genes that were both associated with an enriched mutation and had altered regulation in USA300 strains. We built an independent component analysis (ICA)-based reconstruction of the TRN using 670 publicly available RNA-sequencing samples from both USA300 and non-USA300 CC8 strains. By factoring the RNA-sequencing data into a series of signals and their activities, the ICA-based reconstruction of the TRN shows both the static gene–regulator interaction and the dynamic activity of these interactions in a sample-specific manner (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib49">Sastry et al., 2019</xref>). However, ICA is a generalized signal extraction algorithm and therefore does not distinguish between biological sources of signals like regulatory elements and ‘artificial’ sources that can be created by sourcing data from multiple strains. Therefore, in addition to signals associated with gene regulators, ICA also outputs signals associated with strain-specific changes in gene regulation. Furthermore, by utilizing RNA-sequencing data from hundreds of samples to identify genes with strain-specific expression patterns, this approach is more likely to find strain-specific differences than previous approaches that focus on specific conditions (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Jones et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Iqbal et al., 2016</xref>).</p><p>This analysis revealed several genes with distinct expression patterns in USA300 strains that were also associated with DBGWAS-enriched mutations. One of these genes, <italic>isdH</italic>, which encodes a haptoglobin-binding protein, showed several enriched mutations in the regulatory region of USA300 strains including the deletion of the Fur repressor-binding site. Additionally, the isdH gene generally had higher expression levels in samples from USA300 strains, connecting the mutation enriched by DBGWAS with differences in TRN enriched by ICA. Overall, our analysis shows how the reconstruction of TRN can be used to extend the limits of current GWAS approaches when studying emerging populations of bacterial pathogens.</p></sec><sec id="s2" sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><sec id="s2-1"><title>Classifying USA300 and non-USA300 genomes based on genetic markers</title><p>We sought to compare the genetic differences between USA300 community-associated methicillin-resistant <italic>S. aureus</italic> (CA-MRSA) strains and other subtypes within CC8 that have lower clinical and community burden. Given that both subtypes exist within the same clonal complex, this comparison allowed us to probe the genetic basis for the success of USA300 strains with limited confounding effects of different genetic backgrounds. We downloaded 2033 <italic>S</italic>. <italic>aureus</italic> genomes for analysis and excluded six of them with genome length of less than 2.5 million base pairs. The CC8 pangenome consisted of 19176 gene clusters with 2291 core genes that were present in at least ~95% of the genomes analyzed. Among the remainder of the genes, 931 were categorized as accessory genes and 15,954 were found in less than 5% of the genomes (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1A</xref>). The collection formed a closed pangenome, as adding new genomes did not introduce many new genes (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1A</xref>), suggesting that our collection had a good gene-level coverage of the CC8 pangenome. We confirmed the pangenome coverage with Roary (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1B</xref>). To get a higher resolution view of these genomes, we surveyed unique alleles within the ORFs and in the 300-bp 5′ upstream and 3′ downstream sequences. We found a larger number of mutations within the ORFs, indicating the presence of greater genetic variation in the ORFs than in the neighboring regulatory regions. This is reflective of the fact that most of <italic>S. aureus</italic> genome sequence comprises of ORFs for example ~84% of TCH1516 genome is part of an ORF.</p><fig-group><fig id="fig1" position="float"><label>Figure 1.</label><caption><title>Clonal complex 8 (CC8) pangenome and phylogeny.</title><p>(<bold>A</bold>) Pangenomic analysis of CC8 genomes shows the distribution of genes and mutations in open reading frames (ORFs) and regulatory regions.

GMI was previously developed to rapidly and systematically identify different subclades within inner-CC8 strictly based on genetic markers (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Bowers et al., 2018</xref>). In this scheme, USA300 genomes can be differentiated from non-USA300 CC8 genomes by the presence of either SCC<italic>mec</italic> IVa or the presence of PVL in case of methicillin-susceptible <italic>S. aureus</italic> (MSSA).</p><p>To identify the root of the USA300 clades, we first traversed up nodes of the phylogenetic tree starting from known USA300 strain TCH1516 and determined the number of strains, fraction PVL positive and fraction SCC<italic>mec</italic> IVa positive for each node during traversal. The root was placed at the last node where &gt;90% of the strains within the subclade represented by the daughter nodes were SCC<italic>mec</italic> IVa and PVL positive (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1B</xref>). As phylogenetic trees are nested, root finding with this procedure is not dependent on the starting USA300 strain. Same root was identified when the procedure was initialized with another well-known USA300 reference strain FPR3757 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1C</xref>). Combining the genetic markers with phylogenetic grouping led to the classification of 1449 genomes as USA300 and 589 genomes as non-USA300 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1C</xref>, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="supp1">Supplementary file 1</xref>). Strains previously identified as ‘early USA300’ were not part of our USA300 classification (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Bowers et al., 2018</xref>). While many of these strains are PVL positive, they have variable SCC<italic>mec</italic> types and therefore are likely to be clinically distinct from the USA300 strains.</p></sec><sec id="s2-2"><title>Enriching USA300-specific genes and mutations using DBGWAS</title><p>After classifying the genomes into USA300 and non-USA300 strains, we identified genes and mutations associated with each subtype by using the DBGWAS (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Jaillard et al., 2018</xref>). We used 2030 genomes for this analysis; the 2027 genomes in pangenomics analysis above were ‘spiked’ with three well-known CC8 genomes – TCH1516, COL, and Newman – to help annotate the DBGWAS unitigs. DBGWAS provides a reference genome-free method for conducting GWAS analysis in prokaryotes by building a compacted De Brujin graph to represent the pan genome of input sequences. The nodes of the graph represent unique compacted k-mers that are joined by edges to other nodes with k-mers that appear adjacent to it in genomes. The procedure enriches unique k-mers that appear with different frequencies in each classification and outputs the enriched k-mer as well as its genetic neighborhood (called ‘components’) from the De Bruijn graph. Visualizing the components associated with the enriched k-mers makes it easier to interpret the k-mers and makes it easy to identify large structural variations (e.g. cassette acquisition) which are often represented by multiple enriched k-mers that fall within the same component. We took the output component graphs and automatically extracted the enriched genetic changes, for example indels, single-nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs), phage insertions, etc.</p><p>Many of the components were associated with genes and genetic elements expected to be enriched with USA300 strains – <italic>SCCmec</italic> IVA (the GMI marker), Arginine Catabolite Repressor Element (ACME), <italic>cap5E</italic> point mutation, multiple prophages, etc. (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="supp2">Supplementary file 2</xref>). In total, we found k-mers in 149 components associated with 137 unique TCH1516 genes that were enriched in this analysis, pointing to a large array of mutations that are unique to the USA300 lineage (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2A</xref>).

Barring recombination events, presence of mutation hotspots in the same position in multiple clades could point to selection acting on the sequence. Therefore, we searched for prevalence of enriched mutations in other non-CC8 clades. We identified 61 SNPs within ORFs that were enriched in USA300 strains. To identify mutational hotspots in other clades, we downloaded all the amino acid sequences belonging to the PATRIC genus protein family of each of the gene products encoded by the selected ORFs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib58">Wattam et al., 2014</xref>). The PATRIC local protein family consists of sequences of homologous proteins within the same genus which were further filtered down to <italic>S. aureus</italic> species-specific sequences. After filtering, each protein family comprised 2000–16,000 unique sequences and the strains from which the amino acid sequences were derived spanned dozens of clades allowing for broad comparisons (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s1">Figure 2—figure supplement 1</xref>).

Allelic entropy at a given amino acid position is a function of the number of unique amino acids found in that position and the frequency of the mutation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Hyun et al., 2022</xref>). Positions where all queried sequences have the same amino acid have low entropy, while positions that have frequent amino acid substitutions (hotspots) have high entropy (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3B</xref>). This measure allows us to quickly determine the positions of mutation hotspots while accounting for multiple possible amino acid substitutions and rare mutations. Before calculating the position-specific entropy, all sequences within each of the PATRIC local protein families were aligned with multiple sequence alignment (MSA). This alignment ensures proper comparison of amino acids even when there are deletions or insertions in some of the genes in the family.</p><p>Of the 36 enriched ORF mutations only the Asp75Tyr mutation in the <italic>cap5E</italic> gene, which was previously shown to ablate capsule production in USA300 strains, was found in other strains (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3C</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Boyle-Vavra et al., 2015</xref>).

Despite not having any perfect matches outside of the <italic>cap5E</italic> mutation, we found that for 28 of the mutations, a peak was present in sequences from other clades within 71 MSA positions. Together, our data suggest that mutations within ORFs in USA300 strains are likely de novo mutations and are not acquired through horizontal gene transfer though many of these mutations have occurred in hotspot regions (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3D</xref>).</p></sec><sec id="s2-4"><title>iModulon in the CC8 TRN points to mutations associated with differential regulation</title><p>The presence of genome-wide linkage and de novo mutations in ORFs severely limited the ability to distinguish causal SNPs contributing to increased pathogenesis in USA300 strains.

After stringent QC/QA and curation, 291 non-USA300 strains (e.g. Newman, NCTC8325) and 379 USA300 (e.g. LAC, TCH1516) samples were used to create a single reconstruction of TRN across CC8 using ICA (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib49">Sastry et al., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib50">Sastry et al., 2021</xref>; <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="supp3">Supplementary file 3</xref>).

Therefore, we compared the upstream regulatory region of several reference strains including TCH1516 (USA300), NCTC8325 (CC8b), and 2395 (USA500). Additionally, we included MW2 (CC1 CA-MRSA) as the transcription start site in the region has been experimentally confirmed in this strain (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib47">Prados et al., 2016</xref>).

We also found a second mutation upstream of the predicted –35 binding site that was also enriched in USA300.

However, in studying these groups, genetic methods like GWAS were limited in finding causal mutations due to genome-wide linkage disequilibrium and presence of an unexpectedly large number of de novo mutations unique to the USA300 lineage. Here, we demonstrated how a model of transcriptional regulation with iModulons can be used to make a headway through the impasse created by the high linkage disequilibrium and identify GWAS-enriched mutations that are also associated with measurable phenotypic changes in the TRN. From the combined RNA-sequencing dataset of USA300 and non-USA300 strains, ICA calculated two iModulons that captured strain-specific variation in gene expression. As expected, most genes in the iModulons were part of mobile genetic elements such as ACME and SCC<italic>mec</italic> because they have zero expression level in non-USA300 samples. However, the iModulon also contained several core genes that are present in both groups but are differentially regulated. A deeper analysis of the regulatory region of one of these genes with enriched mutation, <italic>isdH</italic>, revealed a deletion of a DNA segment containing the binding site of the Fur repressor. In congruence with this observation, we also found that USA300 strains with the deleted Fur-binding site showed general increase in <italic>isdH</italic> expression level. This gene encodes IsdH, a surface receptor that binds to human hemoglobin, causing it to release the heme (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Ellis-Guardiola et al., 2020</xref>). It is part of an arsenal of <italic>S. aureus</italic> iron sequestration proteins including Staphyloferrins and ferrous iron transporters that it uses to compete with the host for essential iron (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib57">van Dijk et al., 2022</xref>). Despite having many different pathways for obtaining iron, it has been observed that <italic>S. aureus</italic> prefers heme as its iron source over transferrin-bound iron (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib52">Skaar et al., 2004</xref>). Our analysis shows that preference for heme is reflected in the genomic and transcriptomic signature of USA300 as a deletion of Fur-binding region upstream of <italic>isdH</italic> and subsequent increase in its expression. Combining GWAS with large-scale transcriptomic modeling was therefore able to predict potential causal mutations contributing to the increased clinical burden of the USA300 lineage.</p><p>The current analysis utilized the available DNA- and RNA-sequencing data and the methods used here are scalable to the rapidly growing number of data in the public repositories. Indeed, with the greater scale, we can get more granular insight into subclade-specific differences. The transcriptomic analysis consisted of samples primarily from the USA300 (CC8e and CC8f) clades, the CC8a clade represented by Newman and the CC8b clade represented by NCTC8325 and its derivatives. However, the CC8b and CC8a clades are currently undersampled due to its minimal clinical burden compared to USA300. We therefore combined strains from all non-USA300 clades into a single group for GWAS. The misalignment of RNA-sequencing samples from GWAS samples may explain the low number of hits that were enriched by both methods when many other unique gene expression patterns have been observed in USA300 strains. This misalignment points to the limit of our approach. Most other phenotypes of clinical interest such as antibiotic resistance may not separate cleanly into distinct clades. In those cases, it is not obvious which strains should be chosen as the reference strain for RNA-sequencing and subsequent TRN reconstruction. The choice of reference strain as well as the choices in the RNA-sequencing sample conditions will impact which association between mutations and changes in gene regulations are uncovered.</p><p>With time, the scaling of databases may be able to resolve the issue of imbalanced sampling. On the other hand, resolving the confounding effect of linkage disequilibrium inherent in emerging and clonal strains will require a new generation of modeling methods (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Bal et al., 2016</xref>). Our current approach focuses on modeling the changes in gene regulation at the transcriptional level, but causal mutations can have any number of effects on the phenotype of the organism. New modeling methods that can systematically predict these other phenotypes are now rapidly emerging. Our recent work with <italic>Mycobacterium tuberculosis</italic> utilized a metabolic allele classifier which combines genome scale metabolic models with machine learning to estimate biochemical effects of alleles thus mapping mutations to changes in metabolic fluxes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">Kavvas et al., 2020</xref>).

Once the end nodes are identified, the two paths around the bifurcations representing the case and control specific sequences were identified using the shortest path algorithm in networkx. The sequences from nodes of each path were concatenated, changing the sequences to reverse complements and removing overlaps in sequences when required. The concatenated sequences from each path were then compared using BioPython (v1.83) pairwise global alignments to find the SNPs or indels that differentiate the sequences from case and control (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Cock et al., 2009</xref>). If reference sequences are passed, the concatenated sequences are aligned to the reference sequences using nucleotide BLAST and mutation positions were converted from k-mer positions to positions in the reference genomes.

Using the package, all available RNA-sequencing data for non-USA300 and USA300 strains were downloaded, run through the QC/QA pipeline, manually curated for metadata and aligned to the TCH1516 genome (NC_010079, NC_012417, and NC_010063). The combined data were then transformed into log-TPM (transcripts per million) and normalized to a single reference condition (SRX3760886 and SRX3760891). This contrasts with other ICA models that normalize the data to project-specific reference conditions to reduce batch effects. However, normalizing to project-specific control conditions also erases the strain-specific information as almost all BioProjects contain data from only one isolate (e.g. NCTC8325, TCH1516, LAC, etc). ICA was then run following our previously established pipeline to generate iModulons for CC8 clade <italic>S. aureus</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib49">Sastry et al., 2019</xref>). This process is described in further detail below.</p><p>We began by collecting all available RNA-sequencing data and metadata for <italic>S. aureus</italic> strains from SRA that belonged to the CC8 clade. Most of the sequences were from well-studied CC8 strains – TCH1516, FPR3757, LAC, Newman, and NCTC8325. Others had fewer specific labels for example ‘USA300’ but still belonged to CC8. The fastq files for the samples were trimmed with TrimGalore (v0.6.5) and aligned to reference TCH1516 genome (NC_010079, NC_012417, and NC_010063) with bowtie2 (v1.2.3) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">Krueger, 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">Langmead and Salzberg, 2012</xref>). The gene-specific read counts were calculated with HTSeqCount (v2.0.1) using the intersection-strict criteria. The number of mapped reads was then normalized to TPM and log-transformed (log-TPM).</p><p>Before using the data, the quality of the reads and alignment was assessed using FastQC and MultiQC (v 1.11) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Andrews, 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Ewels et al., 2016</xref>). Any samples failing ‘per base sequence quality’, ‘per sequence quality score’, ‘per base <italic>n</italic> content’, or ‘adapter content’ were dropped. Additionally, we also removed samples with less than 500,000 reads aligned to the reference. Lastly, samples that did not contain replicates or those with replicates with Pearson correlation coefficients less than 0.9 were also excluded. We then collected additional metadata for the remaining 670 RNA-sequencing samples including growth conditions, genetic changes, associated experiment, etc. The log-TPM were then centered to the reference condition of <italic>S. aureus</italic> TCH1516 grown in RPMI+10% LB. By centering data from non-USA300 strains on USA300 reference, ICA is able to pick up strain-specific regulatory changes for example ICA captures the activity of Fur transcription factor as a linear combination of Fur iModulon containing gene regulated by Fur and a second ‘strain-specific’ iModulon that captures differences between USA300 and non-USA300 strains (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s1">Figure 3—figure supplement 1</xref>).</p><p>We applied FastICA to the centered log-TPM to calculate the M and the A matrix which, respectively, describe the iModulon structure and their activities (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib45">Pedregosa, 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">Koldovský et al., 2006</xref>). To find the best possible model, we first had to compute an optimal number of stable components. As FastICA is non-deterministic, each iteration yields a slightly different component weightings and activity levels. It may also yield ‘spurious’ components that are only present in a subset of runs. To find stable components, we ran ICA 100 times with a random seed. Similar components (e.g. same component containing Fur-associated iModulon) from different iterations which may have slightly different weightings were detected by clustering with DBSCAN. Only components that appear in every run were accepted. When running ICA, users must also provide the number of desired components that the data will be decomposed into. Decomposition into too few components could lead to signals from several transcription factors being combined into single components while over decomposition leads to many unstable and ‘single-gene’ iModulons that likely capture noise in the data. To find the optimal number of components we used a heuristic method, OptICA, which runs ICA with different numbers of input components from 10 to 340 and suggests an optimal component that minimizes single-gene iModulons while maximizing robust components (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib41">McConn et al., 2021</xref>). Based on this heuristic, the final model was built with 270 components as input, 148 of which were determined to be robust components.</p><p>In each component, we labeled a gene as being part of an iModulon if their weighting in that component did not fall within a Gaussian distribution as determined by D’Agostino’s test. The genes in each iModulon were then compared to genomic features (e.g. regulons, phage, mobile cassettes, etc.; see ‘TRN’ object in the model), and was determined to be associated with the feature if there was significant overlap between the two groups (hypergeometric test; adjusted p-value &lt;0.05, precision ≥0.5, and coverage ≥0.2). We also manually curated other iModulons associated with other features for example iModulon where all member genes associated with translation were labeled ‘Translation iModulon’. The activities of the output iModulons were manually parsed to look for iModulons with the largest strain-specific differences.</p></sec><sec id="s4-7"><title>Fur box motif search</title><p><italic>isdH</italic> genes in all the genomes were first clustered using CD-HIT with identity and coverage minimum of 0.8 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Fu et al., 2012</xref>).

It used publicly available datasets and a combination of genome-wide association studies (GWAS) and independent principal-component analysis (ICA) of RNA-seq profiles to compare USA300 versus non-USA300 within clonal complex 8. By overlapping the analyses the authors identified a 38bp deletion upstream of the iron-scavenging surface-protein gene isdH that was both significantly associated with the USA300 lineage and with a decreased transcription of the gene.</p><p>Strengths:</p><p>Several genomic studies have investigated genomic factors driving the emergence of successful <italic>S. aureus</italic> clones, in particular USA300. These studies have often focussed on acquisition of key accessory genes or have focussed on a small number of strains. This study makes a smart use of publicly available repositories to leverage the sample size of the analysis and identify new genomics markers of USA300 success.</p><p>The approach of combining large-scale genomics and transcriptomics analysis is powerful, as it allows to make some inferences on the impact of the mutations. This is particular important for mutations in intergenic regions, whose functional impact is often uncertain.</p><p>The statistical genomics approaches are elegant and state-of-the-art and can be easily applied to other contexts or pathogens.</p><p>Weaknesses:</p><p>The main weakness of this work is that these data don't allow a casual inference on the role of isdH in driving the emergence of USA300. It is of course impossible to prove which mutation or gene drove the success of the clone, however, experimental data would have strengthen the conclusions of the authors in my opinion.</p><p>Another limitation of this approach is that the approach taken here doesn't allow to make any conclusions on the adaptive role of the isdH mutation. In other words, it is still possible that the mutation is just a marker of USA300 success, due to other factors such as PVL, ACMI or the SCCmecIVa. This is because by its nature this analysis is heavy influenced by population structure. Usually, GWAS is applied to find genetic loci that are associated with a phenotype and are independent of the underlying population structure. Here, authors are using GWAS to find loci that are associated with a lineage. In other words, they are simply running a univariate analysis (likely a logistic regression) between genetic loci and the lineage without any correction for population structure, since population structure is the outcome. Therefore, this approach can't be applied to most phenotype-genotype studies where correction for population structure is critical.</p><p>Finally, the approach used is complex and not easily reproduced to another dataset. Although I like DBGWAS and find the network analysis elegant, I would be interested in seeing how a simpler GWAS tool like Pyseer would perform.</p></body></sub-article><sub-article article-type="author-comment" id="sa2"><front-stub><article-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.90668.3.sa2</article-id><title-group><article-title>Author response</article-title></title-group><contrib-group><contrib contrib-type="author"><name><surname>Poudel</surname><given-names>Saugat</given-names></name><role specific-use="author">Author</role><aff><institution>University of California, San Diego</institution><addr-line><named-content content-type="city">La Jolla</named-content></addr-line><country>United States</country></aff></contrib><contrib contrib-type="author"><name><surname>Hyun</surname><given-names>Jason</given-names></name><role specific-use="author">Author</role><aff><institution>University of California, San Diego</institution><addr-line><named-content content-type="city">La Jolla</named-content></addr-line><country>United States</country></aff></contrib><contrib contrib-type="author"><name><surname>Hefner</surname><given-names>Ying</given-names></name><role specific-use="author">Author</role><aff><institution>University of California, San Diego</institution><addr-line><named-content content-type="city">La Jolla</named-content></addr-line><country>United States</country></aff></contrib><contrib contrib-type="author"><name><surname>Monk</surname><given-names>Jon</given-names></name><role specific-use="author">Author</role><aff><institution>Palmona Pathogenomics</institution><addr-line><named-content content-type="city">Menlo Park</named-content></addr-line><country>United States</country></aff></contrib><contrib contrib-type="author"><name><surname>Nizet</surname><given-names>Victor</given-names></name><role specific-use="author">Author</role><aff><institution>University of California, San Diego</institution><addr-line><named-content content-type="city">La Jolla</named-content></addr-line><country>United States</country></aff></contrib><contrib contrib-type="author"><name><surname>Palsson</surname><given-names>Bernhard O</given-names></name><role specific-use="author">Author</role><aff><institution>University of California, San Diego</institution><addr-line><named-content content-type="city">La Jolla</named-content></addr-line><country>United States</country></aff></contrib></contrib-group></front-stub><body><p>The following is the authors’ response to the original reviews.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p><bold>Reviewer #1 (Recommendations For The Authors):</bold></p><p>(1) Line 56: replace &quot;pyomastitis&quot; with &quot;pyogenic skin infections&quot;.</p></disp-quote><p>Corrected.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>(2) Line 58: replace &quot;basal strains&quot; with &quot;ancestral strains&quot;.</p></disp-quote><p>Corrected.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>(3) Line 62: population structure impacts gene acquisition too, however, gene acquisitions can be easier to connect with a phenotype. For example, acquisition of mecA is thought to be adaptive rather than just linked to a successful lineage. This same reasoning applies to resistance-associated mutations such as gyrA mutations in ST22 emergence.</p></disp-quote><p>We completely agree with the reviewer that population structure also impacts gene acquisition. We wanted to convey that connecting gain or loss of genes to a change in particular phenotype is much easier than doing the same for a mutation, specially in the presence of strong linkage, and therefore gene level analysis is the focus of many previous studies. We have rewritten the sentence to better convey this idea:</p><p>“Due to this limitation, studies of emerging strains often focus on gene level analysis such as acquisition of mobile genetic elements or loss of gene function as their effect on phenotype is easier to determine than that of point mutations.”</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>(4) Line 112 this might be simply due to the smaller size of the intergenic regions chosen. I suggest to correct for the size of the genome segment considered.</p></disp-quote><p>We thank the reviewer for pointing this out.

However, we were focused on positions that were mostly biallelic in CC8, and with differential prevalence in USA300 vs non-USA300 (albeit in the presence of strong linkage disequilibrium) in addition to having high entropy in non-CC8 strains.

Unfortunately, we found that in many cases, it became difficult to determine the exact mutation that was being enriched e.g. (T234G) without doing lots of manual work.

The introduction is not well-structured, and there is a lack of coherence among the topics pertinent to the research objective. I would recommend rewriting this section addressing the following topics: the challenge of distinguishing lineages within the CC8, especially the CA-MRSA USA300 strains; discussing the state-of-the-art GWAS methodologies, elucidating the main confounding factors in the application of GWAS to bacterial studies, and finally, exploring how current methods aim to address these concerns.</p></disp-quote><p>We would like to thank the reviewer for the suggestions. The main innovation of the paper is using iModulons to find phenotype associated mutations from a set of linked mutations. The challenge of distinguishing CC8 subclades has been largely resolved thanks to efforts by Bowers et al. (PMID: 29720527). We have made some revisions to address the GWAS methodologies (bugwas and DBGWAS), the effect of linkage disequilibrium in interpreting the output of these methods and how combining the results of these association tests with modeling of TRN with iModulons can lead to finding candidate mutations of interest that are linked to specific changes in gene regulation.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Line 56.

Please verify the number of genomes used in the DBGWAS analysis. In the text, the authors mention that 2038 genomes were utilized. However, in Supplementary Table 1, only 2030 genomes are listed.</p></disp-quote><p>Thank you for catching the discrepancy. We started the analysis with 2037 genomes, including four “spiked-in” reference genomes- USA100 D592 (CC5 strain used for rooting the CC8 tree), TCH1516 (same accession number as the one used for ICA), COL and Newman. Before further analysis, we removed 6 genomes for being smaller than 2.5 million base-pairs (see preprocessing.ipynb) and the USA100 D592 strain as it is not part of CC8. This resulted in 2030 genomes being used for DBGWAS. We kept the other 3 spiked CC8 genomes to help annotate the unitigs from DBGWAS. Lastly, we removed the other three CC8 clade spiked genomes for pangenomic analysis. To clarify this, we have made the following changes to the text:</p><p>(1) Changed line 106: We downloaded 2033 <italic>S.</italic> aureus genomes for analysis and excluded six of them with genome length of less than 2.5 million base pairs. The remaining 2027 <italic>S. aureus</italic> CC8 genomes formed a closed pangenome, suggesting that the sampled genomes mostly captured the gene level variations within the clonal complex (Figure 1a).</p><p>(2) DBGWAS section Line 177: We used 2030 genomes for this analysis; the 2027 genomes in pangenomics analysis above were “spiked” with three well known CC8 genomes- TCH1516, COL, and Newman- to help annotate the DBGWAS unitigs.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Line 108.

On what basis did the authors decide on the size of the upstream regulatory region? In the search for mutations, they extracted segments of 300 base pairs, whereas, in the search for the Fur binding motif, only 100 base pairs were considered. The RegPrecise database contains regulons for <italic>Staphylococcus aureus</italic> N315 (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://regprecise.lbl.gov/genome.jsp?genome_id=26">https://regprecise.lbl.gov/genome.jsp?genome_id=26</ext-link>), including the Fur regulon with multiple Transcription Factor Binding Sites (TFBSs) that extend beyond the 100 base-pair sequence. I would recommend reconsidering the search within the standardized upstream region of -400 base pairs. In the case of the Fur binding motif search, it might be beneficial to include the TFBSs available in the RegPrecise database.</p></disp-quote><p>For Fur motif search, we chose 100 base-pairs because the Fur motif in non-USA300 strains were within ~20 base-pairs of <italic>isdH</italic> translation start site (Figure 4C). In our search of Fur motif in this analysis, we were not looking to see if any exists, we were simply looking to see if the one proximal to the translation start site exists as our DBGWAS analysis suggested that specific region was deleted in USA300 strains.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Line 175. This work aimed to identify potential mutations associated with the success of a specific lineage rather than a phenotype, where correction for population structure effects is necessary. Would the implementation of the bugwas method in DBGWAS for controlling bacterial population structure not potentially impact the results? How was this issue addressed in your analysis? Would it not be pertinent to run a program without population structure correction to enable a comparison of results?</p></disp-quote><p>We initially tried to use Linear Mixed Models to find kmers that were only enriched in USA300 strains. These efforts were hampered by extreme linkage disequilibrium which led to high collinearity between kmer abundance making it extremely difficult to get a good estimate of the coefficients. We also tried to run chi-squared tests individually on each kmer which led to unmanageable number (&gt;100k) kmers that were significantly different. DBGWAS on the other hand was able to compress unbranched kmers in the De Bruijn into unitigs and further reduce the number of tests by testing at pattern level instead of unitig level. We found no straight forward way to run DBGWAS (or GEMMA) without population structure correction. Therefore, it is likely we may be underestimating the number of significant unitigs with this approach.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Line 189.

I would strongly recommend validating the results using at least one established tool.</p></disp-quote><p>With our analysis, we can determine proper thresholds for core/accessory/unique genes based on the observed data (Supplementary Figure 1a). However, we agree that it would be proper to include a more established pangenome package. We have added the results of Roary to our analysis. The Roary results largely agree with our biggest take away from pangenomics which is that our collection of genomes have a good coverage of the CC8 clade at the gene level.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Line 370.
