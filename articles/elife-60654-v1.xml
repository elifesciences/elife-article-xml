However, describing the conformational changes of proteins within these complexes, especially when the proteins are in their native cellular context, has proven challenging. In this paper, we establish a technique to visualize the orientations of domains of proteins <italic>in vivo</italic> and we apply this technique to study the conformational changes in the nuclear pore complex (NPC).</p><p>The scaffold of the NPC is a cylindrical channel composed of proteins that form an eight-spoked core with an axis perpendicular to the nuclear envelope (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Alber et al., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Kim et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Kosinski et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Mosalaganti et al., 2018</xref>). NPCs are composed of ~30 distinct proteins called nucleoporins (Nups) represented in 8, 16, or 32-fold copy number. An individual yeast NPC is composed of ~500 Nups for a total mass of ~66 MDa (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">Rout and Blobel, 1993</xref>), whereas a vertebrate NPC has ~1000 total Nups (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Hoelz et al., 2011</xref>) fpr a tptal mass of ~109 MDa (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">Reichelt et al., 1990</xref>). From the scaffold of the NPC, relatively unstructured domains of Nups protrude into the lumen of the cylinder. These are known as ‘FG-nups’ because they contain repeat motifs of phenylalanine-glycine that interact with cargo and its chaperones, known as the importins, exportins, or karyopherins (kaps). While the organizing principles of the NPC are shared across eukaryotes, there are notable variations even between human cell lines. Differential expression levels (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">D'Angelo et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Lupu et al., 2008</xref>) and stoichiometries (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Ori et al., 2013</xref>) of Nups are observed between different cell types. Furthermore, within the mammalian NPC, different Nups have been shown to have different residence times, which has led to the suggestion that those with shorter residence times may serve adaptor or regulatory functions (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Rabut et al., 2004</xref>). The additional mass of the mammalian NPC exists in the absence of substantial changes to the size of the central channel, raising the possibility that the mammalian NPC is subject to additional regulation.</p><p>In the adherent cell lines used in this study, the nuclei tend to be flattened ovoids and the NPCs on the basal surface share a common orientation with their central axis perpendicular to the coverslip. Since each component of the NPC is in 8-fold symmetry, it is a compelling test structure to assay conformational changes <italic>in vivo</italic>. Using polarized-total internal reflection fluorescence microscopy (pol-TIRFM), we monitored the orientation of mEGFP-based sensors incorporated into different domains of individual NPCs in living cells. Previously, to measure the organization of various Nups with respect to the NPC we used fluorescence anisotropy. We determined the organization of the Y-shaped complex with respect to the NPC (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Kampmann et al., 2011</xref>) and characterized the orientations and rigidity of the FG-Nup domains (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Atkinson et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Mattheyses et al., 2010</xref>). The anisotropy approach used polarized light to excite many dozens of NPCs and then measure the emission parallel and perpendicular to the excitation.</p><p>In this study, we examine the orientation of components of the scaffold and establish that the conformation of the inner ring of the NPC is modulated by both transport state and specific transport factors. To monitor conformational changes in the scaffold of the NPC, we built orientational sensors by rigidly attaching mEGFP to different Nup domains. We conjugated the alpha helix at the amino terminus of mEGFP to the carboxyl terminus of a Nup domain. Thus, the orientation of mEGFP is fixed to that of the Nup. The orientation of mEGFP can be monitored because the excitation dipole is fixed within the molecule. The strength of mEGFP excitation is proportional to cos<sup>2</sup>(Θ), where Θ is the angle between the excitation light and the excitation dipole. To monitor the orientation of the mEGFP, we excited the fluorophore sequentially with light polarized in two orthogonal directions. To restrict excitation to the basal surface of the cell we created the two polarized fields using excitation by total internal reflection (TIR). Because the basal nuclear envelope is parallel to our coverslip, the NPCs embedded in the nuclear envelope are oriented relative to the optical axis of our microscope. Therefore, we could monitor the orientation of Nups within individual NPCs in living cells. Our results show a rearrangement of the structural core of the NPC, in particular of the inner ring Nups, in response to manipulations of transport through the NPC.</p></sec><sec id="s2" sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><sec id="s2-1"><title>The orientation of Nup-mEGFP fusion proteins can be monitored with polarized-total internal reflection fluorescence microscopy (pol-TIRFM)</title><p>We alternated the polarization of the excitation field between <inline-formula><mml:math id="inf1"><mml:mstyle displaystyle="true" scriptlevel="0"><mml:mrow><mml:mrow><mml:mover><mml:mi>p</mml:mi><mml:mo stretchy="false">^</mml:mo></mml:mover></mml:mrow></mml:mrow></mml:mstyle></mml:math></inline-formula>-polarized light (perpendicular to the coverslip and parallel to the nucleo-cytoplasmic axis of each NPC) and <inline-formula><mml:math id="inf2"><mml:mstyle displaystyle="true" scriptlevel="0"><mml:mrow><mml:mrow><mml:mover><mml:mi>s</mml:mi><mml:mo stretchy="false">^</mml:mo></mml:mover></mml:mrow></mml:mrow></mml:mstyle></mml:math></inline-formula>-polarized light (parallel to the coverslip and perpendicular to the nucleo-cytoplasmic axis of each NPC).

Nup133 is a member of the Y-shaped complex, which forms two reticulated rings at both the nuclear and cytoplasmic faces of the NPC (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Bui et al., 2013</xref>). Nup93 is a member of the Nup93 complex (along with Nup205, Nup188, Nup155, and Nup53) and Nup54 and Nup58 are members of the Nup62 complex (along with Nup62). Both the Nup93 and Nup62 complexes localize to the inner ring (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib41">Vollmer and Antonin, 2014</xref>), between the two reticulated rings of Y-shaped complexes. The Nup93 complex is embedded within the NPC scaffold, and the Nup62 complex sits adjacent, closer to the lumen of the nuclear pore (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Kosinski et al., 2016</xref>). Therefore, our orientational sensors were localized to three different structural positions within the NPC (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1C</xref>).</p><p>Plasmids encoding putative orientational sensors were engineered to encode each Nup fused via an alpha helix to mEGFP. We removed the first four amino acids of the mEGFP because they are not resolved in the crystal structure, suggesting that they are not rigid. We transfected these plasmids into HeLa cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1A</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1</xref>). With an algorithm that uses a Laplacian of blob-detection method (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Pulupa, 2020</xref>) the distribution of total intensities of the puncta observed was only a single peak indicating we are detecting individual NPCs.

If the mEGFP is rigidly conjugated to a Nup that is properly incorporated into the NPC, then changes of the p:s ratio represent changes in orientation of the domain of the Nup to which the mEGFP is conjugated.</p><p>If the mEGFP is held rigidly relative to a Nup, then changing the length of the alpha-helical linker by a single amino acid should rotate the mEGFP ~103° around the axis of the alpha helix. Therefore, if our reporter is a proxy for the orientation of the Nup, the p:s ratio should shift with the number of amino acids in the linker. This hypothesis was tested by inserting rigid or flexible linkers of different lengths between mEGFP and the terminal structured alpha helix of Nup54 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1E</xref>), which is defined as residues 456–494 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">Solmaz et al., 2011</xref>). The constructs were transiently transfected into HeLa cells, and the p:s ratios were measured in living cells 24–48 hr post transfection. The p:s ratio shifted with different lengths of the rigid linkers, confirming that the dipole of the mEGFP is a proxy for the orientation of the Nup54 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1F</xref>). No difference in p:s ratio was observed with varying lengths of the flexible linkers (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1G</xref>). Thus, we developed a criterion whereby orientational sensors are considered functional if the p:s ratio shifts upon the addition of a single amino acid.</p><p>Using this criterion, we confirmed that we have orientational sensors with mEGFP conjugated to Nup133, Nup93, Nup58, and Nup54 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2A–D</xref>). We saw distinct shifts in the p:s ratio when constructs differed by a single amino acid. An exception was when mEGFP was placed at the carboxyl terminus of Nup54. This domain is currently unresolved in any crystal structure, and the p:s ratio did not change upon rotating the linker alpha helix (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2E</xref>). This indicates that this domain of Nup54 is not held rigidly, consistent with the inability to crystallize this domain of the protein and suggests the carboxyl terminus is a flexible domain. For any specific Nup-mEGFP, variations in the p:s ratio in different NPCs were not detected with respect to position along the basal surface of the nucleus (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1</xref>), indicating a shared orientation for these NPCs.</p><fig id="fig2" position="float"><label>Figure 2.</label><caption><title>Varying the length of the linker between the Nup and the mEGFP by single amino acids to test validity of the orientational sensors.</title><p>(<bold>A</bold>) Nup133-mEGFP, with linkers of different lengths at its carboxyl terminus, conjugated to mEGFP.

These conformational changes are consistent with observations that NPC diameter is altered in HeLa cells under different physiological conditions (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Mahamid et al., 2016</xref>) and with observations of NPCs with different diameters from <italic>S. cerevisiae</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Allegretti et al., 2020</xref>). Our results are also consistent with the Ring Cycle hypothesis. Further studies will be needed to determine the exact conformations we are monitoring in this study, and to what extent the conformations we observe align with these models. In addition to changes in orientation, we also observe increases in FRET in the FG-regions of Nup62 upon starvation, which is consistent with a spatial rearrangement and constriction of the NPC diameter. The NPC structure as a whole may be modulated by cargo load and identity. Compositional and structural flexibilities in the NPC underscore the complexity of this macromolecular complex, and their effects on transport and regulation remain exciting future avenues of research in the field.</p><p>The experiments we present have been done at the level of single active NPCs in which altered conformations are correlated to the loading of kaps. Our results are consistent with orientational changes to the inner ring of the NPC in response to changes in transport state. Although we cannot yet calculate the magnitude of the angle changes of these alpha helices, we can say with confidence that these alpha helices are experiencing a rearrangement with respect to the NPC after they are confronted with perturbations in transport. Further, these orientational shifts are confined to the inner ring, the most constricted portion of the NPC: similar changes are not detected when probes are placed in other locations. It is possible that those regions are moving translationally and thus escaping our detection, which is sensitive only to orientation changes with respect to the nucleo-cytoplasmic axis.</p><p>The imaging technique presented here allows for the monitoring of Nup orientational changes within many individual NPCs simultaneously in a single living cell. We used this approach to look at dynamics of assembly of HIV-1 <italic>in vivo</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Johnson et al., 2018</xref>). This technique builds upon on our previous work (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Atkinson et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Kampmann et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Mattheyses et al., 2010</xref>) to provide tools to directly observe the conformations and orientational dynamics of Nups in living cells. By expanding this technique into pol-TIRFM, we have developed tools to that allow us to directly observe the orientational changes of Nups within a single NPC in living cells and to track these changes over time with different cargo conditions.</p><p>This light microscopy technique can be used to probe the orientations of different domains within an individual protein either on its own or as part of a macromolecular complex. By allowing one to not only localize a protein, but to also monitor the orientations of different domains within a protein, this technique can provide insights into various molecular mechanisms. Polarization microscopy can be used to monitor the dynamics and organization of domains of other macromolecular complexes <italic>in vivo</italic> and <italic>in vitro</italic>, including the ribosome, proteasome, centriole, and cilia. Although to use this technique <italic>in vivo</italic>, the macromolecular complex to be studied would need to have an axis that can be defined with respect to the illumination field, these geometric limitations only exist <italic>in vivo.</italic> Using nanofabrication techniques, a macromolecular complex or substrate can be conjugated with respect to the coverslip and the orientation of a dynamic domain can be monitored. Although the technique currently requires a carboxyl-terminal alpha helix of a peptide domain of interest to be conjugated to the amino alpha helix of a fluorescent protein, development of orientationally confined fluorescent probes will allow the domain of any protein to be tagged and monitored.</p></sec><sec id="s4" sec-type="materials|methods"><title>Materials and methods</title><table-wrap id="keyresource" position="anchor"><label>Key resources table</label><table frame="hsides" rules="groups"><thead><tr><th valign="top">Reagent type <break/>(species) or <break/>resource</th><th valign="top">Designation</th><th valign="top">Source or reference</th><th valign="top">Identifiers</th><th valign="top">Additional information</th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td valign="top">Antibody</td><td valign="top">α- karyopherin α1/6 (2D9) (rat monoclonal)</td><td valign="top">Santa Cruz</td><td valign="top">sc-101540 <break/>RRID:<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://scicrunch.org/resolver/AB_2133549">AB_2133549</ext-link></td><td valign="top">IF 1:500</td></tr><tr><td valign="top">Antibody</td><td valign="top">α-kap1ß/impß −1 (3E9) (mouse monoclonal)</td><td valign="top">Abcam</td><td valign="top">ab2811 <break/>RRID:<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://scicrunch.org/resolver/AB_2133989">AB_2133989</ext-link></td><td valign="top">IF 1:1000</td></tr><tr><td valign="top">Antibody</td><td valign="top">anti-Rabbit IgG (H+L) Cross-Adsorbed Secondary Antibody, Alexa Fluor 488 (goat polyclonal)</td><td valign="top">Invitrogen</td><td valign="top">CAT # A-11008 <break/>RRID:<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://scicrunch.org/resolver/AB_2534074">AB_2534074</ext-link></td><td valign="top">IF 1:2000</td></tr><tr><td valign="top">Antibody</td><td valign="top">anti-Mouse IgG (H+L) Cross-Adsorbed Secondary Antibody, Alexa Fluor 594 (goat polyclonal)</td><td valign="top">Invitrogen</td><td valign="top">CAT # A-11005 <break/>RRID:<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://scicrunch.org/resolver/AB_141372">AB_141372</ext-link></td><td valign="top">IF 1:2000</td></tr><tr><td valign="top">Antibody</td><td valign="top">anti-GFP: Living Colors A.v.

Cells were incubated with live-cell Hoechst (NucBlue Live ReadyProbes, Hoeschst 33342, ThermoFischer Scientific). Cells were then imaged to quantify the nuclear NLS-tdTomato. All excitations were done in a ‘semi’-TIRFM excitation mode, which restricts fluorescence to a few micrometers near to the coverslip to illuminate more of the nucleoplasm. Nuclear regions were determined by constructing a mask in FIJI using the Hoescht staining and finding the average intensity in arbitrary units of the tdTomato signal (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Schindelin et al., 2012</xref>).</p></sec><sec id="s4-13"><title>Ran-GTP loading and karyopherin removal</title><p>Ran was loaded with GDP using published methods (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Lowe et al., 2015</xref>). 1 mM Ran was incubated with 50 mM GDP in 10 mM HEPES pH 7.3, 100 mM NaCl and 10 mM EDTA at RT for 30 min. Then the sample was diluted 2.5x in four steps at 1 min intervals in 10 mM HEPES pH 7.3, 100 mM NaCl, 10 mM EDTA and MgCl<sub>2</sub> such at the final concentration of MgCl<sub>2</sub> was 25 mM. The solution was then dialyzed in TB overnight.</p><p>To remove kaps, cells were treated with Ran mix using published methods (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Adam et al., 1992</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Kapinos et al., 2017</xref>). Cells were incubated with Ran mix in TB+pvp for 1 hr (2 mM GTP, 0.1 mM ATP, 4 mM creatine phosphate, 20 U/mL creatine kinase, 5 M RanGDP, 4 µM NTF2, and 1 mM DTT).</p></sec><sec id="s4-14"><title>CRISPR cell lines</title><p>Guides and repair templates were constructed by using the Benchling CRISPR design tool (Benchling, San Francisco, CA). Guides were cloned into the pSpCas9(BB)−2A-Puro (PX459) V2.0 plasmid following standard protocols as developed by the Zhang lab (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Ran et al., 2013</xref>). The repair templates for Nup54<sup>494</sup>-mEGFP(0) and Nup133-mEGFP(−9) were synthesized by GenScript as dsDNA. This DNA was then A’-tailed and placed in a TOPO-TA Cloning Vector (2.1-TOPO, ThermoFisher Scientific). Repair templates for Nup54<sup>494</sup>-mEGFP(1) and Nup54<sup>494</sup>-mEGFP(2) and Nup133-mEGFP(−8) were cloned from the repair template plasmids constructed above via the QuikChange Lightning Site-Directed Mutagenesis Kit (Agilent, Santa Clara, CA). For each CRISPR cell line, cells were transfected with linearized repair templates and the PX459 plasmid containing the appropriate guides using FuGENE HD (Promega) with a ratio of Reagent : DNA of 3 : 1 according to manufacturer’s protocol. Transfected cells were selected via antibiotic selection with puromycin (0.6 µg/mL, InvivoGen, San Diego, CA) for 48 hr. Cells were released from antibiotic selection and allowed to recover for 24 hr. GFP positive cells were collected in the Rockefeller University Flow Cytometry Resource Center using a FACSAria II flow cytometer (BD Biosciences, San Jose, CA). Cells were resuspended in PBS (no calcium/no magnesium, Gibco), 0.5% (vol/vol) bovine serum albumin (BSA, Sigma), 5 mM EDTA (Gibco), and 15 mM HEPES (ThermoFisher). GFP positive cells were sorted and screened via live-cell microscopy for signal at the nuclear rim (~95% of GFP positive cells showed nuclear rim GFP signal). Cell lines were screened for homozygosity via PCR. Two bands were seen for heterozygotes and one band for homozygotes, both fragments were sequenced to confirm amplification of correct region and proper incorporation of the mEGFP. In order to confirm that the mEGFP was not incorporated elsewhere and producing another labeled protein within our cells, western blots were performed. Protein samples were run on a 4–12% Bis-Tris gel (Novex) and Western blots were performed with the following antibodies: α-GFP (Clontech Living Colors 632381 (JL-8); RRID:<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://scicrunch.org/resolver/AB_2313808">AB_2313808</ext-link>, mouse monoclonal, 1:1,000) and goat α-mouse–HRP (Sigma–Aldrich; RRID:<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://scicrunch.org/resolver/AB_258476">AB_258476</ext-link>, 1:50,000). Membranes were then striped with Restore Western Blot Stripping Buffer (ThermoFisher) and western blots were performed with the following antibodies: α-actin (Abcam; RRID:<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://scicrunch.org/resolver/AB_476743">AB_476743</ext-link>, 1:1,000) and goat α-mouse–HRP (Sigma–Aldrich; RRID:<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://scicrunch.org/resolver/AB_258476">AB_258476</ext-link>, 1:50,000). All blocking and incubations were done in 5% (wt/vol) nonfat milk powder in Tris-buffered saline with Tween 20.</p></sec><sec id="s4-15"><title>Quantification and statistical analysis</title><p>Statistical analyses were performed using MATLAB Version 2019b and are described in the figure legends and in the Method Details.</p></sec></sec></body><back><ack id="ack"><title>Acknowledgements</title><p>We thank Günter Blobel, Elias Coutavas, and Ivo Melčák for Nup58, Kap-Alpha1, and Kap-Beta1 cDNA and for the his-Ran plasmid. pSpCas9(BB)−2A-Puro (PX459) V2.0 was a gift from Feng Zhang (Addgene plasmid # 62988).

Technically, this work builds on their past published papers (Biophys J. 2013, Nat Struct Mol Biol. 2011, Biophys J. 2010 Sep 22;99(6):1706-17), now extended to single NPC resolution. After exploring suitable fluorescent protein fusions of nucleoporins in the Y-complex (Nup133), and two aspects of the inner ring (Nup93 and the FG nups, Nup58 and Nup54) that are sensitive to the orientation of the fluorophore, they then examine how different perturbations to transport affect these orientation sensors. Numerous treatments expected to alter nucleocytoplasmic transport change the orientation of Nup54 and Nup58, including starvation, inhibition of Crm1-mediated nuclear export, and expression of a dominant-negative form of the Ran-GTPase. Another observation is that permeabilizing cells alters the orientation of Nup54 (mimicking the perturbations listed above), but this can be restored by incubation with Kapa1 and Kapb. Consistent with the interpretation that the Kaps alter the conformation of Nup54, the orientation change upon permeabilization can be augmented (and sped up) by addition of Ran-GTP, which was previously shown to strip Kaps from the NPC. Last, the authors use an orthogonal approach (a FRET reporter in Nup62); the Nup62 protomers show increased FRET upon starvation.</p><p>Overall there was enthusiasm for the approach, particularly its potential to provide a quantitative analysis of conformational changes in the NPC, as well as an appreciation for the technical feat of detecting anisotropy changes on the single NPC level. In terms of the biology, while there is a rich understanding of the architecture of the NPC from structural biology, a major unanswered question is the dynamic conformations of the nuclear pore complex that are sampled, under what conditions such structural changes occur, and the physiological relevance. In this respect, the reviewers found the evidence that the reporters reflect changes in the inner ring of the NPC in response to starvation and other perturbations to be largely convincing. There were, however, several aspects of the work that the reviewers felt could be improved. A particular concern was how the orientation changes relate to the structural states of the NPC. A second was on the ability to fully interpret the changes in the orientation of Nup54 and Nup58 with regards to large scale changes in the NPC. There were also several areas that the reviewers felt could use further clarification, as outlined below. Lastly, the reviewers expect that the authors will want to comment on their results in the context of the recent work from the Beck lab on starvation and NPC structure.</p><p>Essential revisions:</p><p>1) There was a consensus that getting beyond a &quot;yes/no&quot; of whether a change occurred to some concept of the kind of orientation change that took place in the context of the NPC would greatly strengthen the work. As presented, it was not clear how much Nup orientation changed nor how this relates to the state of the NPC itself (e.g., dilated vs. constricted) or its engagement with components like transport factors. The reviewers made several suggestions for how this might be achieved. First, the reviewers felt that the authors should address/interpret/discuss the quantitative differences/similarities in the p:s behavior across test conditions, particularly when this could be put into greater context of the NPC structure. Another approach that the reviewers considered is whether the authors can better leverage the extensive prior structural studies on the NPC and nucleoporins, the known orientation of the NPC relative to the evanescent wave and the polarization in this experimental set-up, and the differences in the observed p:s ratio upon stepping the linker by single amino acids, to interpret more detail about how the perturbations are influencing the position of the tagged nups in the NPC. Combining such data with a model-based theory could constrain the possibilities. Last, and related to the prior two points, was the possibility that the new work from the Beck lab might better position the authors to bridge their observations with more specific changes in the NPC (see next point).</p><p>2) While this paper has been under review a related paper (albeit in a different model) from Martin Beck's group (Allegretti et al.) was posted to the bioRxiv. The reviewers felt it important that a revision address this work in their interpretation and discussion. Specifically: 1) How do the observations compare about the response to starvation (recognizing that the fission yeast and mammalian NPC have different structure)?; 2) Can the authors draw any parallels with the Allegretti paper, particularly the increase of FRET in Nup62 after starvation? Can the authors suggest if this implies constriction or dilation?; 3) the Beck paper suggests that the observed changes are distinct from those proposed in the &quot;Ring Cycle&quot; – this should be taken into account in the Discussion here.</p><p>3) The reviewers felt it important to discriminate between the effects of Kap binding to the FG nucleoporins in the act of transporting cargo versus effects solely of Kap binding (independent of transport). This point could be addressed using Kap separation-of-function mutants such as the N-terminal truncation of Kap-β.</p><p>4) There were several questions related to the observation that the specific nucleoporins that showed changes in orientation in response to transport properties of the NPC directly associate with karyopherins through their FG-domains, which are part of the same polypeptide with the structured domains (where the fluorophore is fused). Thus, the major movements could be restricted to within the same polypeptide. This begs the question of whether transport alters the inner ring in a concerted manner beyond the state of the individual FG nucleoporin. One suggestion is to monitor, in the transient transfections, Nup54 truncations lacking the FG-repeat domain still respond in the same manner, which would be strong evidence propagation of the inner ring complex independent of engagement of its FG region. Ideally this would be achieved by titrating in the FG-less Nup54.</p><p>5) Further explanation/discussion is needed for the observed effects of adding Ran mutant/leptomycin B. Specifically, when hydrolysis is blocked, RanQ69L-GTP-importin complexes should not dissociate. If so, importins would no longer be available for undertaking another round of import in the cytoplasm. Likewise, NES-cargo-RanQ69L-GTP-exportin triple complexes should not disassemble. In this event, transiting pools of RanQ69L-GTP-importin and NES-cargo-RanQ69L-GTP-exportin ought to remain at NPCs due to binding to the FG Nups. How is it the p:s ratio in Figure 4L shares a similar trend with Figure 4H (i.e., a decrease)? How might this compare to what happens in the NPC after permeabilization (Figure 4H)? Leptomycin B inhibits NES-cargo binding to Crm1, thereby decreasing the amount of NES-cargo being exported through the NPC. Can the authors please attempt an explanation as to how the p:s ratio in Figure 4J shares a similar trend to Figure 4H and L (i.e., a decrease)?</p><p>6) Can the authors please comment on the difference in observed behavior reported in Figure 5F/H and Figure 4H? The Nup54 p:s ratio increases upon removing endogenous karyopherins by +Ran mix (pink, Figure 5F). Adding exogenous karyopherins then returns the p:s ratio towards pre-Ran mix values (blue). Moreover, no change to the p:s ratio is seen when Ran mix is absent (Figure 5H). Again, Nup54 p:s ratio decreases &quot;in a buffer containing no transport factors or cargo&quot; (Figure 4H) when these experiments do not seem so different. What might bring about these differences?</p><p>7) The reviewers were concerned that some statements in the manuscript were either over-sold or over-interpreted. Specifically, please revise to avoid &quot;first time statements&quot; including: &quot;we have developed the first tools to directly observe the orientational dynamics of Nups within a single NPC in living cells and to track these dynamics over time 1 with different cargo conditions&quot;, which is dismissive of the various prior studies in the literature showing that the NPC can change its structure. While the authors employ live-cells (clearly an advance), their &quot;dynamics&quot; are in reality snapshots at steady state, at least several minutes or hours apart. In addition, the reviewers would ask the authors to revise the manuscript to acknowledge that they cannot rule out that a conformational change occurs outside the inner ring because it could not be observed using this approach. Lastly, the reviewers suggest that the title &quot;Cargo modulates the conformation of the nuclear pore in living cells&quot; is overstated. Suggested: &quot;Transport state modulates the conformation of the nuclear pore in living cells&quot;</p><p>8) The reviewers would like the authors to report not just orientation (the p:s ratio in the manuscript) but also rigidity – that is, the anisotropy. This was seen as particularly important because it is unclear whether rigidity of inner ring Nups will vary with nuclear transport state.</p></body></sub-article><sub-article article-type="reply" id="sa2"><front-stub><article-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.60654.sa2</article-id><title-group><article-title>Author response</article-title></title-group></front-stub><body><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Essential revisions:</p><p>1) There was a consensus that getting beyond a &quot;yes/no&quot; of whether a change occurred to some concept of the kind of orientation change that took place in the context of the NPC would greatly strengthen the work.

We are strong believers in doing quantitative analysis of the results, especially across different test conditions. We have analyzed the quantitative differences across different treatments of the same probe. However, we are also cautious about over-interpreting our results. In the absence of additional structural information (see below), we think it is inappropriate to try to calibrate the physical magnitude of the change of the orientation of the Nup.</p><p>Therefore, we have added further interpretation to both the analysis of Figure 4:</p><p>“The effects of starvation and permeabilization appear to be more pronounced than that of the drug treatment and the dominant-negative Ran. This may be due to a more severe reduction in cargo flux, and therefore a more complete assumption of the NPC of the state adopted when cargo flux is reduced.”</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Another approach that the reviewers considered is whether the authors can better leverage the extensive prior structural studies on the NPC and nucleoporins, the known orientation of the NPC relative to the evanescent wave and the polarization in this experimental set-up, and the differences in the observed p:s ratio upon stepping the linker by single amino acids, to interpret more detail about how the perturbations are influencing the position of the tagged nups in the NPC. Combining such data with a model-based theory could constrain the possibilities.</p></disp-quote><p>We appreciate this suggestion! In the past, we have used fluorescence polarization measurements to determine the orientation of Nup133 and the y-shaped complex within the NPC. We did this by comparing results of measurements of anisotropy to computational predictions based on the crystal structure of Nup133 and the cryo-EM structure of the y-shaped complex. These experiments were easier to perform with Nup133 because we were simply testing how the y-shaped complex fit into the NPC, and there was much established structural knowledge of the y-shaped complex.</p><p>We have been intrigued by the possibility of combining the orientational changes we are able to measure with structural data of the NPC. We believe that this is a potential next step. Determining the precise angle of the change of orientation of the inner ring nups would require additional structural information about how exactly these alpha helices are incorporated into the NPC, as well as considerable computational work. Since August 2019 we have been speaking with Jan Kosinski about joining forces to use his structural measurements with our fluorescence. Alas, the structural information is still not resolved enough to join these data sets so this kind work will have to be outside of the scope of this project. We look forward to building, in the future, a computational model to calculate the angle changes of the alpha helices to which our probes are conjugated.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Last, and related to the prior two points, was the possibility that the new work from the Beck lab might better position the authors to bridge their observations with more specific changes in the NPC (see next point).</p><p>2) While this paper has been under review a related paper (albeit in a different model) from Martin Beck's group (Allegretti et al.) was posted to the bioRxiv.

This beautiful work with an orthogonal technique is an independent confirmation of our data showing conformational changes in the main scaffold of the NPD that are associated with transport state. We started an active discussion with Kosinski and Beck over a year ago, once we felt we had a robust, reproducible story. We have been trying to coordinate with them both the kinds of perturbations on transport that we use as well as the Nups we focus on. However, we want to be cautious about not overinterpreting our data. We are confident in the measurement of the change of FRET and the change in the relative excitation by p and s light. Consequently, we are confident in changes of orientation that correlate with the change of transport. However, we feel as if it could be a disservice to the reader to overinterpret the results at this point in terms of a specific model.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Specifically: 1) How do the observations compare about the response to starvation (recognizing that the fission yeast and mammalian NPC have different structure)?;</p></disp-quote><p>We have added the following section to the Discussion:</p><p>“While this manuscript was in review, cryo-EM tomograms revealed in situ NPCs taken from <italic>S. cerevisiae</italic> cells in exponential growth phase were ~20 nm larger in diameter than isolated NPCs from <italic>S. cerevisiae</italic>, underscoring the potential flexibility of the NPC (Allegretti et al., 2020).“</p><p>And revised our analysis as follows:</p><p>“The conformational changes we observe in the NPCs of living cells may be coincident with cargo translocation or may be an indication that the scaffold of the NPC serves as a dynamic gate that can regulate nuclear trafficking.

Although this is not the Kap separation-of-function mutant, there was no additional cargo introduced in this experiment. In the absence of cargo, we did observe that the Kaps alone caused the NPC to be in an alternate conformation. In the future, we hope to track individual cargos transiting through the pore while monitoring the orientation of Nups to see the how transiting cargo affects the conformation of the NPC.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>4) There were several questions related to the observation that the specific nucleoporins that showed changes in orientation in response to transport properties of the NPC directly associate with karyopherins through their FG-domains, which are part of the same polypeptide with the structured domains (where the fluorophore is fused).

We have performed this experiment, and we show that Nup54 orientational sensors lacking an FG-domain experience the same conformational changes as Nup54 orientational sensors containing a wild-type FG-domain. We appreciate the suggestion and agree that these results provide evidence that the conformational change is propagated throughout the inner ring, independent of the engagement karyopherins with individual Nup whose orientation is being altered.</p><p>We have added this figure to our manuscript as Figure 3—figure supplement 2. We have also added the following statement to our Results:</p><p>“The orientation shift of Nup54 was also seen in Nup54 orientational sensors where the FG-Nup domain was eliminated. This result suggests that these orientational changes are propagated throughout the inner ring, independent of whether the individual Nup54 polypeptide containing orientational sensor is bound to a kap.”</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>5) Further explanation/discussion is needed for the observed effects of adding Ran mutant/leptomycin B.

How is it the p:s ratio in Figure 4L shares a similar trend with Figure 4H (i.e., a decrease)? How might this compare to what happens in the NPC after permeabilization (Figure 4H)? Leptomycin B inhibits NES-cargo binding to Crm1, thereby decreasing the amount of NES-cargo being exported through the NPC. Can the authors please attempt an explanation as to how the p:s ratio in Figure 4J shares a similar trend to Figure 4H and L (i.e., a decrease)?</p></disp-quote><p>All methods of decreasing cargo flux through the NPC resulted in the same orientational change in Nup54. (That is that 4F, 4H, 4J, and 4L) all showed the same trend. One possible explanation that would explain this shift is that in all of these cases, the cargo flux is decreased. It is possible that the conformational plasticity we observe is necessary for the transport of large cargoes or inner nuclear membrane proteins, transport of all of which would be reduced in cells under starvation, permeabilization, leptomycin B, or dominant-negative ran treatment. Thus, the conformational change is permissive for transport, but is neutral as to the direction of transport. Specifically, in the text we state:</p><p>“These results suggest that attenuating the transport of NLS-driven cargo shifts the orientation of select alpha-helical domains of inner ring Nups. The direction of the p:s ratio shift of Nup54-mEGFP494 is consistent among all mechanisms of reducing cargo flux.”</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>6) Can the authors please comment on the difference in observed behavior reported in Figure 5F/H and Figure 4H? The Nup54 p:s ratio increases upon removing endogenous karyopherins by +Ran mix (pink, Figure 5F). Adding exogenous karyopherins then returns the p:s ratio towards pre-Ran mix values (blue). Moreover, no change to the p:s ratio is seen when Ran mix is absent (Figure 5H). Again, Nup54 p:s ratio decreases &quot;in a buffer containing no transport factors or cargo&quot; (Figure 4H) when these experiments do not seem so different. What might bring about these differences?</p></disp-quote><p>We apologize for the confusion and we have sought to clarify these points in text. We see a change in the orientation of Nup54 upon permeabilization of the cells. This, we believe is the result of the reduction of karyopherins and cargo. In the case of Figure 4H, the control (CM, left) is an unpermeabilized cell in complete media. The experiment (PERM, right) is a permeabilized cell. Thus, the right column of Figure 4G is equivalent to the t=0 (left most column) of Figure 5F-I.</p><p>We have modified text when describing Figure 4H and Figure 4G to help clarify this point:</p><p>“When we permeabilize cells and incubate in transport buffer plus 1.5% (wt/vol) 360kD polyvinylpyrrolidone to mimic cytosolic conditions, we observed a distinct shift in the orientation of Nup54<sup>494</sup> compared to the orientation of Nup54<sup>494</sup> in unpermeabilized cells grown in complete media. We saw no change in the orientation of Nup133 in permeabilized cells compared to Nup133 in unpermeabilized cells grown in complete media (Figure 4G-H).”</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>7) The reviewers were concerned that some statements in the manuscript were either over-sold or over-interpreted.

We agree with these comments and have made the suggested changes in text and in the title. In addition to eliminating “first time statements” and replacing the word “dynamics,” we also added the following statement to our Discussion:</p><p>“It is possible that those regions are moving translationally and thus escaping our detection, which is sensitive only to orientation changes with respect to the nuclear-cytoplasmic axis.”</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>8) The reviewers would like the authors to report not just orientation (the p:s ratio in the manuscript) but also rigidity – that is, the anisotropy. This was seen as particularly important because it is unclear whether rigidity of inner ring Nups will vary with nuclear transport state.</p></disp-quote><p>We have been struggling to report anisotropy values using pol-TIRF. However, we do not yet feel comfortable reporting absolute values for two reasons. First, anisotropy will always be a convoluted measurement, containing information about both orientation and rigidity. In a system where the Nups are organized with dependence around an optical axis, it is highly challenging to separate the two. Another obstacle to reporting anisotropy is the mixing of light of different polarizations when they are collected using a high-NA TIRF objective [in a nutshell, at the higher angles, a component of the light polarized in z is split to the x and y axis. This extent of this varies as one moves more to the periphery of the lens.]. Thus, as the light is collected, parallel and perpendicular emissions are mixed, and at the high-NA we are using (1.49), the correction factors for that have been developed break down. We have been working during this response to address this issue but we realize that a full reworking with proper calibrations and validations of these correction factors for lenses of high numerical aperture is its own two year project. Although, we are interested in developing methods to measure anisotropy in TIRF, we do not believe we currently are able to report anisotropy in a rigorous manner.</p></body></sub-article></article>
