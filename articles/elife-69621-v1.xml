They are synthesized in the mitochondria as Fe-S intermediates and are exported to the cytoplasm for maturation by the mitochondrial transporter ABCB7. Here, we demonstrate that ABCB7 is required for bone marrow B cell development, proliferation, and class switch recombination, but is dispensable for peripheral B cell homeostasis in mice. Conditional deletion of ABCB7 using Mb1-cre resulted in a severe block in bone marrow B cell development at the pro-B cell stage. The loss of ABCB7 did not alter expression of transcription factors required for B cell specification or commitment. While increased intracellular iron was observed in ABCB7-deficient pro-B cells, this did not lead to increased cellular or mitochondrial reactive oxygen species, ferroptosis, or apoptosis. Interestingly, loss of ABCB7 led to replication-induced DNA damage in pro-B cells, independent of VDJ recombination, and these cells had evidence of slowed DNA replication. Stimulated ABCB7-deficient splenic B cells from CD23-cre mice also had a striking loss of proliferation and a defect in class switching. Thus, ABCB7 is essential for early B cell development, proliferation, and class switch recombination.</p></abstract><kwd-group kwd-group-type="author-keywords"><kwd>ABCB7</kwd><kwd>B cells</kwd><kwd>iron</kwd></kwd-group><kwd-group kwd-group-type="research-organism"><title>Research organism</title><kwd>Mouse</kwd></kwd-group><funding-group><award-group id="fund1"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000060</institution-id><institution>National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>1R21 AI157328-01</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Shapiro</surname><given-names>Virginia Smith</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund2"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000060</institution-id><institution>National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>T32AI007425</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Lehrke</surname><given-names>Michael Jonathan</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><funding-statement>The funders had no role in study design, data collection and interpretation, or the decision to submit the work for publication.</funding-statement></funding-group><custom-meta-group><custom-meta specific-use="meta-only"><meta-name>Author impact statement</meta-name><meta-value>In the absence of ABCB7, B cell development is halted at the pro-B cell stage and stimulated splenic B cells have impaired proliferation and reduced class switch recombination.</meta-value></custom-meta></custom-meta-group></article-meta></front><body><sec id="s1" sec-type="intro"><title>Introduction</title><p>Iron is critical for numerous cellular processes including ATP production, cellular metabolism, and DNA replication and damage repair (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Fuss et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib47">Lane et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib54">Lill and Mühlenhoff, 2006</xref>). However, labile iron (nonprotein bound) is highly toxic to cells as it can potently induce the formation of reactive oxygen species (ROS) through the Fenton reaction (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib49">Lawen and Lane, 2013</xref>). To protect organisms and cells from excess ROS, iron homeostasis is highly regulated at both a systemic and cellular level, which balances iron storage, transport, and utilization (reviewed by <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Anderson and Frazer, 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib49">Lawen and Lane, 2013</xref>). It is thought that most cellular iron uptake in lymphocytes occurs through transferrin receptor 1 (TfR1; CD71), which binds transferrin-bound iron at the cell surface (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib47">Lane et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib49">Lawen and Lane, 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib63">Ned et al., 2003</xref>). Intracellular iron can be stored in ferritin, which sequesters iron to prevent it from undergoing the Fenton reaction (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib49">Lawen and Lane, 2013</xref>). Alternatively, intracellular iron can be transported to the mitochondria for storage in mitochondrial ferritin or utilization in the biosynthesis of heme and iron-sulfur (Fe-S) clusters (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib47">Lane et al., 2015</xref>), making mitochondria essential for iron homeostasis. Typically, iron uptake and storage are controlled by intracellular iron levels through the activity of iron-responsive element-binding protein 1 (IRP1) and IRP2 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib47">Lane et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib49">Lawen and Lane, 2013</xref>). However, many aspects of mitochondrial iron trafficking and storage are still not well understood (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib70">Paul et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib79">Richardson et al., 2010</xref>).</p><p>Fe-S clusters are important cofactors for numerous proteins involved in cellular metabolism, DNA replication, and DNA damage repair (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Fuss et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib47">Lane et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib54">Lill and Mühlenhoff, 2006</xref>). These proteins include ferredoxin (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib48">Lange et al., 2000</xref>); components of NADH:ubiquinone oxidoreductase (Complex I) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib66">Ohnishi, 1998</xref>); DNA primase (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib42">Klinge et al., 2007</xref>); all of the replicative DNA polymerases (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib64">Netz et al., 2011</xref>, reviewed by <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Baranovskiy et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib77">Puig et al., 2017</xref>); the helicases Dna2, FancJ, and XPD (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib60">Mariotti et al., 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib82">Rudolf et al., 2006</xref>); and the glycosylases Endo III and MutY (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Cunningham et al., 1989</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib76">Porello et al., 1998</xref>). Fe-S cluster intermediates are first biosynthesized in the mitochondria, after which they are transported to the cytoplasm for maturation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib59">Maio and Rouault, 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib81">Rouault, 2012</xref>). The inner mitochondrial membrane protein ABCB7 is important for Fe-S cluster maturation as it is thought to export an Fe-S-glutathione intermediate from the mitochondria to the cytoplasm (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib52">Li and Cowan, 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib73">Pondarré et al., 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib78">Qi et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib89">Srinivasan et al., 2014</xref>). Previous work demonstrated that ABCB7 is essential for life as ABCB7-deficient embryos failed to develop extra-embryonic tissues and tissue-specific deletion revealed a requirement for development and function of numerous cell types (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib73">Pondarré et al., 2006</xref>). ABCB7 was also found to be critical for hematopoiesis as conditional deletion with Mx1-cre resulted in rapid bone marrow failure with pancytopenia (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib74">Pondarre et al., 2007</xref>), but the requirement of ABCB7 for the development of specific hematopoietic lineages was not examined. HeLa cells have been shown to accumulate mitochondrial iron in the absence of ABCB7 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Cavadini et al., 2007</xref>); however, hepatocytes and endothelial cells appeared to be viable without ABCB7 and did not have iron accumulation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib73">Pondarré et al., 2006</xref>). Therefore, some cell types appear to possess a compensatory mechanism to export Fe-S-glutathione intermediates in the absence of ABCB7, while ABCB7 is critical for this function in other cell types.</p><p>While iron levels have been linked to the proliferation and function of peripheral lymphocytes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib41">Jiang et al., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib95">Watanabe-Matsui et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib97">Yarosz et al., 2020</xref> and reviewed by <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Cronin et al., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib45">Kuvibidila et al., 2003</xref>), their role in B cell development and peripheral B cell homeostasis has not been thoroughly characterized. Here, we show that ABCB7 is essential for B cell lymphopoiesis as B cell-specific conditional deletion of ABCB7 resulted in a severe block at the pro-B cell stage of development. We found that ABCB7-deficient pro-B cells accumulated iron, but did not have excess ROS or cell death. Gene expression changes indicated the near absence of pre-B cells. ABCB7-deficient pro-B cells also had reduced heavy chain recombination, and B cell development was restored upon introduction of a fully rearranged MD4 Hel-Ig transgenic B cell receptor (BCR). Interestingly, we found evidence that DNA damage was occurring in ABCB7-deficient pro-B cells independent of recombination. These results suggest that DNA damage was occurring during replication in the absence of ABCB7. Intriguingly, we found that ABCB7 was dispensable for peripheral B cell homeostasis. Using a B cell-specific CD23-cre to conditionally delete ABCB7 from peripheral B cells, we did not observe an obvious loss of B cell populations or numbers. However, we observed that CD23-cre ABCB7 cKO B cells had a striking defect in proliferation and class switching during in vitro class switch recombination (CSR) assays, but the severity of the defect was dependent upon stimulation signals received during culture. Pro-B cells bearing the fully rearranged MD4 Hel-Ig BCR had restored proliferation, likely as a result of IgM and IgD expression on these developing cells. These data demonstrate that ABCB7 is required for B cell development, proliferation, and CSR but is dispensable for peripheral B cell homeostasis.</p></sec><sec id="s2" sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><sec id="s2-1"><title>ABCB7 is required for pro-B cell development but is dispensable for peripheral B cell homeostasis</title><p>Previous literature demonstrated that ABCB7 is essential for hematopoiesis, but the role of ABCB7 in the development of specific hematopoietic lineages was not examined (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib74">Pondarre et al., 2007</xref>). To elucidate the role of ABCB7 in B cell development, ABCB7 was conditionally deleted by crossing ABCB7 floxed mice (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Clarke et al., 2006</xref>) with Mb1-cre (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">Hobeika et al., 2006</xref>) transgenic mice, which express cre in early pre-pro-B cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Fahl et al., 2009</xref>). Mb1-cre ABCB7 conditional knockout (cKO) mice had a severe reduction in B220<sup>+</sup> CD19<sup>+</sup> bone marrow B cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1A</xref>, left-hand plots). A majority of the ABCB7-deficient B cells in Mb1-cre ABCB7 cKO mice were B220<sup>+</sup> CD19<sup>+</sup> CD43<sup>+</sup> pro-B cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1A</xref>, middle-left plots). Analysis of Hardy fractions (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Hardy et al., 1991</xref>) in Mb1-cre ABCB7 cKO mice revealed a significant decrease in the proportion of developing B cells starting at fraction (Fr.) B, which had a threefold reduction when quantified as a percentage of live bone marrow cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1C</xref>). There was also a nearly threefold reduction in the proportion of Fr. C cells in these mice (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1C</xref>). A 13-fold decrease in the proportion of Fr. C’ cells and a nearly 70-fold decrease in the proportion of Fr. D cells in Mb1-cre ABCB7 cKO mice indicated a severe block during pro-B development (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1A</xref>, middle-right plots, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1C</xref>). Quantification of the absolute cell numbers for each Hardy fraction confirmed a striking block during pro-B development and loss of later B cell development stages in Mb1-cre ABCB7 cKO mice (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1A</xref>). The ratio of the number of Fr. C cells over the number of Fr. C’ cells also supported a pro-B cell development block as Mb1-cre ABCB7 cKO mice had more Fr. C (pro-B) cells than Fr. C’ (large pre-B) cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1B</xref>). Very few IgM<sup>+</sup> cells were observed in Mb1-cre ABCB7 cKO mice, with dramatic reductions in the proportions and numbers of naïve Fr. E cells and recirculating Fr.

These data indicate ABCB7-deficient cells were blocked at the pro-B cell stage and failed to continue development into pre-B cells.

These mice also express a human CD5 (huCD5) reporter linked to cre expression via an IRES (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib46">Kwon et al., 2008</xref>). CD23-cre ABCB7 cKO mice had normal proportions of each Hardy fraction in the bone marrow (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1A and C</xref>), although the number of Fr. B and Fr. C’ cells was slightly reduced in these mice (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1A</xref>). Expression of the huCD5 reporter was only observed in mature, recirculating cells (Fr. F) and was absent from any pro- or pre-B cell (Fr.

There were no differences observed in the numbers of T1, T2, T3, follicular (FO), or marginal zone (MZ) B cells in CD23-cre ABCB7 cKO mice (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1B and D</xref>), implying that peripheral B cell homeostasis in these mice was also unaffected by the absence of ABCB7. Expression of the huCD5 reporter was largely absent on the majority of T1 cells, while expressed on T2, a large majority of T3, FO, and MZ B cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s2">Figure 1—figure supplement 2B</xref>), confirming that the B cell-specific <italic>Cd23</italic> promoter turns on at the transition from T1 to T2 B cells.

Because heme synthesis occurs in the mitochondria, mitochondrial iron could be shunted into the heme synthesis pathway for export in the absence of ABCB7. The expression of heme oxygenase-1 (HO-1) was examined as a surrogate marker for heme levels as HO-1 expression is upregulated when intracellular heme levels increase (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib95">Watanabe-Matsui et al., 2011</xref>). Expression of HO-1 in Mb1-cre ABCB7 cKO pro-B cells was not significantly different compared to WT pro-B cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3B</xref>). Therefore, there does not appear to be an increase in intracellular heme in ABCB7-deficient pro-B cells. ABCB7-deficient HeLa cell cultures displayed a cytoplasmic iron starvation phenotype, characterized by upregulated CD71 expression, despite accumulating mitochondrial iron (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Cavadini et al., 2007</xref>).

MitoTracker Green measures mitochondrial abundance while TMRM labels active mitochondria with intact membrane potential (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Floryk and Houstĕk, 1999</xref>).

To do so, Bodipy 581/591C-11 (Bodipy C-11) oxidation was assessed by flow cytometry. Bodipy C-11 emits red fluorescence until it is oxidized by lipid peroxides, after which the emission shifts to green fluorescence and can be used to quantify cells with increased lipid peroxides.

Checkpoint kinase 1 (Chk1) is an effector kinase that enforces the S-phase checkpoint until DNA damage is resolved and is required for B cell development at the pro- to pre-B cell transition (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Boddy et al., 1998</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Feijoo et al., 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib85">Schuler et al., 2017</xref>). Analysis by flow cytometry revealed a slight but significant decrease in the expression of phosphorylated Chk1 (pChk1) in ABCB7-deficient Fr.

Intriguingly, this suggests that the activation of effector kinases during the S-phase checkpoint in ABCB7 deficient pro-B cells is partially diminished. The tumor suppressor p53 is a downstream target of the Chk1 during the S-phase checkpoint and is stabilized to control the cell cycle in the presence of DNA damage (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib86">Shieh et al., 2000</xref>). p53 expression was analyzed in ABCB7-deficient Fr.

To determine if DNA damage-sensing pathways were altered upstream of Chk1 activation, expression of phosphorylated ataxia-telangiectasia mutated (pATM), a checkpoint kinase upstream of Chk1 that is activated in the presence of DNA damage (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib87">Smith et al., 2010</xref>), was analyzed. Expression of pATM was significantly reduced in ABCB7-deficient Fr.

CDK2 expression was significantly decreased in ABCB7-deficient Fr. C cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7J</xref>). Ki-67 was also analyzed in Fr.

C cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7K</xref>), suggesting that ABCB7-deficient cells had lost proliferation potential and were dropping out of the cell cycle in response to DNA damage occurring during DNA replication. Together, the reduction in CDK2 and loss of Ki-67 are consistent with an extended S-phase checkpoint. Cell cycle analysis using DAPI revealed that Fr. B cells from Mb1-cre ABCB7 cKO mice had a larger percentage of cells in G1 and a reduction in the percentage of cells in G2, while the proportion of cells in S phase was unchanged (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7L</xref>, left-hand plot and graph). Fr.

These data support the loss of proliferation potential in ABCB7-deficient pro-B cells as more cells are in G1 and fewer Fr. C cells are progressing through S and G2/M phases.

ABCB7-deficient B cells stimulated in these cultures underwent fewer cell divisions (quantified as proliferation index, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8">Figure 8D</xref>, left graph) and a larger number of cells were undivided (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8">Figure 8D</xref>, right graph). As seen with expression of antibody isotypes above, the severity of the defect in proliferation in the absence of ABCB7 was context dependent, with IgG1- and IgG2b-stimulating conditions having a stronger effect on proliferation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8">Figure 8C and D</xref>). Because ABCB7-deficient cells had less robust proliferation, cell viability was observed over time in IgG1-stimulating culture conditions. WT cells had a clear increase in cell viability after 2 days of stimulation, consistent with robust proliferation, which was not evident in CD23-cre ABCB7 cKO IgG1-stimulating cultures (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8s2">Figure 8—figure supplement 2A</xref>, solid lines). Interestingly, unstimulated CD23-cre ABCB7 cKO B cells did not have altered viability compared to unstimulated WT cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8s2">Figure 8—figure supplement 2A</xref>, dashed lines), suggesting that this difference in cell viability is only apparent in stimulated cells due to altered proliferation. The dtableecrease in ABCB7-deficient cell viability was observed in each culture condition tested, with ABCB7-deficient cells in IgG1- and IgG2b-stimulating cultures having a more severe decrease (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8s2">Figure 8—figure supplement 2B</xref>) and a corresponding profound decrease in the number of live cells recovered (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8s2">Figure 8—figure supplement 2C</xref>). Thus, peripheral B cells from CD23-cre ABCB7 cKO mice have reduced proliferation and cell viability. As reduced Ki-67 expression was observed in ABCB7-deficient pro-B cells, Ki-67 expression was analyzed in splenic B cells after 4 days in class switch culture conditions. Stimulated splenic B cells from CD23-cre ABCB7 cKO mice had a larger number of undivided, Ki-67<sup>-</sup> cells compared to WT mice (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8">Figure 8E</xref>), consistent with a loss of proliferation potential in the absence of ABCB7.

Additionally, these ABCB7-deficient pro-B cells had evidence of DNA damage in proliferating cells, but not in nonproliferative cells that would be undergoing heavy chain recombination (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7</xref>). This indicated that nonproliferating, ABCB7-deficient pro-B cells undergoing heavy chain recombination were not accumulating DNA damage. ABCB7-deficient splenic B cells also had reduced proliferation, class switching, and Ki-67 expression upon stimulation in culture, but the severity of the defect was signal-dependent (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8">Figure 8</xref>). Therefore, it was intriguing that peripheral B cell proportions and numbers were restored in the spleens of HEL-Ig Mb1-cre ABCB7 cKO mice (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6</xref>). Interestingly, there was no difference in Ki-67 expression between HEL-Ig WT and HEL-Ig Mb1-cre ABCB7 cKO pro-B cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig9">Figure 9A</xref>). Additionally, analysis of cell cycle status using DAPI revealed that ABCB7-deficient HEL-Ig CD127<sup>+</sup> pro-B cells had equivalent proportions of cells in G1, S, and G2/M phases (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig9">Figure 9B</xref>). These data suggest that ABCB7-deficient pro-B cells in HEL-Ig Mb1-cre ABCB7 cKO mice have intact proliferation potential.

Similar to ABCB7-deficient pro-B cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7</xref>), ABCB7-deficient HEL-Ig pro-B cells had a significant reduction in EdU gMFI (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig9">Figure 9D</xref>, right graph), indicating that DNA replication in HEL-Ig Mb1-cre ABCB7 cKO pro-B cells was slowed in the absence of ABCB7. In addition, like Mb1-cre ABCB7 cKO pro-B cells, HEL-Ig Mb1-cre ABCB7 cKO pro-B cells had increased expression of pH2A.X in proliferating cells but not in nonproliferating cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig9">Figure 9E and F</xref>). These data demonstrate that in the presence of a fully rearranged BCR, ABCB7-deficient cells have restored proliferation potential and EdU incorporation. HEL-Ig mice bear a fully rearranged BCR, with μ and δ constant regions under endogenous control of the Eμ enhancer, that is expressed early during B cell development and pro-B cell development is altered in these mice (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Goodnow et al., 1988</xref>). Therefore, the presence of BCR signals received in developing pro-B cells in HEL-Ig mice may rescue proliferation in the absence of ABCB7. Expression of IgM and IgD on WT, Mb1-cre ABCB7 cKO, HEL-Ig WT, and HEL-Ig Mb1-cre ABCB7 cKO B220<sup>+</sup>CD19<sup>+</sup>CD43<sup>+</sup> cells was analyzed by flow cytometry.

Together, these data show that despite slowed proliferation and evidence of DNA damage in proliferating cells, HEL-Ig ABCB7-deficient pro-B cells are able to reconstitute the peripheral B cell compartment, which may be due to signals received at the pro-B cell stage through IgM and IgD.</p><fig id="fig9" position="float"><label>Figure 9.</label><caption><title>Improved proliferation of B cells from HEL-Ig Mb1-cre ABCB7 conditional knockout (cKO) mice.</title><p>(<bold>A</bold>) Intracellular flow cytometry analysis of Ki-67 expression in pro-B cells (B220<sup>+</sup> CD19<sup>+</sup> CD43<sup>+</sup> CD127<sup>+</sup>) from HEL-Ig wild-type (WT) and HEL-Ig Mb1-cre ABCB7 cKO mice.

Mb1-cre ABCB7 cKO mice had notable iron accumulation and a severe block during pro-B cell development (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figures 1</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">3A</xref>). Strikingly, ABCB7 was not required for splenic B cell homeostasis as CD23-cre ABCB7 cKO mice had normal populations and numbers of peripheral B cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1</xref>). Surprisingly, splenic B cells deficient in ABCB7 did not exhibit iron accumulation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s1">Figure 3—figure supplement 1</xref>). The block in pro-B cell development was not due to alterations in critical transcription factors, iron-related cellular stress, or elevated apoptosis (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figures 2</xref>—<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">4</xref>). ABCB7-deficient cells had significantly reduced expression of intracellular μHC and diminished recombination at the heavy chain locus (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5</xref>). These data suggested that ABCB7-deficient pro-B cells either had defective recombination or were halted in pro-B development prior to recombination.</p><p>Introduction of a fully rearranged transgenic BCR was able to restore bone marrow B cell proportions and splenic B cell numbers in Mb1-cre ABCB7 cKO, despite these cells still having iron accumulation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6</xref>). Analysis of proliferation using short-term EdU labeling demonstrated that fewer ABCB7-deficient pro-B cells incorporated EdU and that ABCB7-deficient pro-B cells incorporated less EdU compared to WT cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7C and D</xref>). Interestingly, ABCB7-deficient pro-B cells that incorporated EdU had elevated expression of pH2A.X compared to WT pro-B cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7A and B</xref>), which suggested an increase in DNA damage in proliferating cells but not cells undergoing heavy chain recombination. Pro-B cells from Mb1-cre ABCB7 cKO mice also had altered DNA damage sensing and a striking loss of proliferation potential as measured by Ki-67 expression (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7K</xref>). Interestingly, pro-B cell proliferation was found to be restored in developing B cells bearing a fully rearranged transgenic HEL-Ig receptor, despite these cells still having evidence of elevated DNA damage in the absence of ABCB7 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig9">Figure 9</xref>). This indicates that the defect in pro-B cell development in the absence of ABCB7 is likely due to a proliferation defect rather than simply an accumulation of DNA damage. How proliferation is restored in HEL-Ig Mb1-cre ABCB7 cKO pro-B cells remains to be seen. It may be due to the nature of the signal received by HEL-Ig pro-B cells as normally pro-B cells receive signals through the pre-BCR to pass the heavy chain checkpoint, but would receive signals through IgM and IgD in HEL-Ig transgenic mice instead (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig9">Figure 9G</xref>).</p><p>Although there was no defect in peripheral B cell homeostasis, ABCB7-deficient splenic B cells also had a significant defect in proliferation and Ki-67 expression during in vitro CSR assays (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8">Figure 8</xref>), demonstrating that ABCB7 is critical for peripheral B cell proliferation as well. Intriguingly, some conditions in the CD23-cre ABCB7 cKO class switching cultures had a more profound defect in B cell proliferation and class switching, suggesting that different signaling pathways influence the severity of the proliferation defect. Together, these data demonstrate that ABCB7 is required for proliferation, pro-B cell development, and CSR.</p><p>Previous literature has demonstrated the importance of ABCB7 in iron homeostasis as some cell types accumulate mitochondrial iron, have defects in Fe-S cluster and heme synthesis, and have altered cytoplasmic aconitase activity upon the loss of ABCB7 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Cavadini et al., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib73">Pondarré et al., 2006</xref>). In agreement with these findings, we found that conditional deletion of ABCB7 in pro-B cells resulted in iron accumulation as indicated by Phen Green quenching (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3A</xref>). Unexpectedly, we did not observe iron accumulation occurring in splenic B cells upon conditional deletion of ABCB7 in CD23-cre ABCB7 cKO mice at homeostasis. It has been hypothesized that other transporters may compensate for the loss of ABCB7, at least in some cell types. Liver-specific deletion of ABCB7 did not result in iron overload, which the authors suggested was due to unique iron homeostasis in hepatocytes or the existence of a complementary iron exporter (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib73">Pondarré et al., 2006</xref>). ABCB7 was also found to be dispensable for endothelial cells, although iron levels were never quantified in these cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib73">Pondarré et al., 2006</xref>). One candidate transporter that may share redundant function with ABCB7 is ABCB8, which is also thought to also transport Fe-S clusters to the cytoplasm. ABCB8-deficient cardiomyocytes displayed elevated levels of mitochondrial iron and ROS (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib40">Ichikawa et al., 2012</xref>). However, pro-B cells and follicular B cells express ABCB8 at similar levels (Immgen: <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">Heng et al., 2008</xref>), suggesting that ABCB8 is likely not compensating for ABCB7-deficiency in CD23-cre ABCB7 cKO peripheral B cells at homeostasis or upon stimulation in class switch cultures. Cardiomyocytes also express ABCB7, which did not appear to compensate for loss of ABCB8 expression (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib40">Ichikawa et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib44">Kumar et al., 2019</xref>), implying that ABCB7 or ABCB8 have different roles in certain cell types. It is possible that a currently unknown iron exporter may compensate for the loss of ABCB7 in splenic B cells at homeostasis. Additionally, peripheral B cells may uniquely handle iron trafficking or storage compared to pro-B cells, which may prevent these cells from accumulating mitochondrial iron in the absence of ABCB7.</p><p>Iron overload is potentially toxic to cells as it can potently induce the formation of ROS, which can induce mitochondrial damage, disrupt the electron transport chain, or cause DNA damage (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib49">Lawen and Lane, 2013</xref>). Despite the extensive iron accumulation occurring in pro-B cells upon conditional deletion of ABCB7, we did not find evidence of elevated cellular or mitochondrial ROS (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3E and F</xref>) and mitochondria were normal (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3D</xref>). Two explanations for this are that the cells are effectively negating any excess ROS generated or the accumulating iron is being sequestered and stored in mitochondrial ferritin (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib47">Lane et al., 2015</xref>). We did observe reduced level of GSH (glutathione; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3H</xref>), an abundant antioxidant utilized by cells to protect from ROS (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">Haenen and Bast, 2014</xref>), a possible indication that these cells are utilizing GSH to negate any excess ROS. However, ABCB7 transports an Fe-S-GSH intermediate (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib52">Li and Cowan, 2015</xref>), which may accumulate in the mitochondria and make GSH unavailable for antioxidant activity. It remains to be seen whether the lack of excess ROS and normal mitochondria is due to unique iron handling in pro-B cells and/or an effective antioxidant pathway protecting the cells from iron-derived ROS.</p><p>The Fe-S-GSH intermediates transported by ABCB7 mature in the cytoplasm where they are then used as critical cofactors for numerous enzymes involved in DNA replication and damage repair, including DNA primase, all replicative DNA polymerases, the helicases Dna2, FancJ, and XPD, and the glycosylases Endo III and MutY (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Baranovskiy et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Cunningham et al., 1989</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Fuss et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib42">Klinge et al., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib60">Mariotti et al., 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib64">Netz et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib76">Porello et al., 1998</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib77">Puig et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib82">Rudolf et al., 2006</xref>). Because we observed pH2A.X was highly expressed in EdU<sup>+</sup> cells, we hypothesize that DNA damage is being induced during replication due to defects caused by aberrant Fe-S cluster transport in the absence of ABCB7. The reduced amount of EdU<sup>+</sup> incorporation in Mb1-cre ABCB7 cKO pro-B cells implies that replication is slower in these cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7A–D</xref>). HEL-Ig ABCB7-deficient pro-B cells also had increased pH2A.X expression in EdU<sup>+</sup> cells and had evidence of slower proliferation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig9">Figure 9C–F</xref>), but these B cells were able to reconstitute peripheral B cell populations in the absence of ABCB7, implying that the slowed proliferation did not inhibit development of these cells. It is unclear if the slowed replication is due to slower polymerase, inefficient helicase-mediated DNA unwinding, increased DNA damage, or defective DNA damage repair, which are all possible if fewer Fe-S clusters are available for incorporation into critical enzymes. It is unlikely that any DNA damage occurring is due to excess ROS caused by iron accumulation because of the lack of excess ROS discussed above. DNA damage induced during replication may also explain the decrease in absolute numbers of Fr. B and Fr. C cells in Mb1-cre ABCB7 cKO mice as these cells undergo proliferation before undergoing heavy chain recombination (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Hardy et al., 1991</xref>). Because DNA damage can block heavy chain recombination (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Arya and Bassing, 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Bahjat and Guikema, 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Fisher et al., 2017</xref>), replication-induced DNA damage occurring in early B cell progenitors may also account for the reduction in heavy chain recombination and expression of μHC we observed in ABCB7-deficient pro-B cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5</xref>).</p><p>The modest decrease in pATM, pChk1, and p53 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7</xref>) expression suggests that ABCB7-deficient cells also have a partially defective DNA damage response. The reduced expression of Chk1 and pChk1 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7F and G</xref>) is of particular interest because Chk1-deficient B cells have a block in B cell development at the pro-B cell stage. Chk1-haploinsufficient B cells had elevated DNA damage and underwent cell cycle arrest (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib85">Schuler et al., 2017</xref>), similar to what we observed in ABCB7-deficient pro-B cells. In addition to decreased Chk1 and pChk1 expression in ABCB7-deficient pro-B cells, we observed decreased CDK2 and Ki-67 expression. CDK2 has non-redundant functions during the S-phase checkpoint that promotes activation of DNA damage response and phosphorylation of Chk1. Elimination of CDK expression delays S/G2 progression after DNA damage. Additionally, knockdown of CDK2 promotes a cell cycle exit program, as marked by reduction in Ki-67 and decreased phosphorylation of Chk1 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Bačević et al., 2017</xref>), which is in agreement with our data (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7F and K</xref>). These data suggest that ABCB7-deficient pro-B cells encounter DNA damage during replication and either drop out of the cell cycle or are spending extended periods of time at the S-phase checkpoint. Stimulated ABCB7-deficient peripheral B cells also had a decrease in the proportion of cells expressing Ki-67 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8">Figure 8E</xref>), further suggesting a link between ABCB7 activity and proliferation potential as measured by Ki-67 expression. Interestingly, pro-B cells from HEL-Ig Mb1-cre ABCB7 cKO mice had restored Ki-67 expression, cell cycle status, and EdU incorporation, despite evidence of elevated DNA damage in proliferating ABCB7-deficient cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig9">Figure 9A</xref>). This suggests that different stimuli can influence proliferation in ABCB7-deficient cells, which is supported by the variable effect of ABCB7-deficiency on proliferation in different class switch conditions (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8">Figure 8</xref>).</p><p>Currently, it is not clear why DNA damage is occurring in proliferating pro-B cells in the absence of ABCB7. It is also unclear why the DNA damage response is partially diminished in these cells. As mentioned, Fe-S clusters exported by ABCB7 are critical cofactors in numerous enzymes involved in DNA replication and damage repair. Whether Fe-S cluster incorporation into these enzymes is defective in the absence of ABCB7 remains to be seen. Additionally, it will be interesting to see if the activity of these DNA enzymes is diminished in ABCB7-deficient pro-B cells. Are pro-B cells more sensitive to alterations in the activities of these enzymes compared to peripheral B cells at steady state? And finally, is T cell development or homeostasis affected by the absence of ABCB7 or are pro-B cells uniquely sensitive to the loss of ABCB7? Future work exploring the role of ABCB7 in the development and homeostasis of lymphocytes will provide insight into how these cells regulate Fe-S export, iron homeostasis, proliferation, and DNA damage repair.</p></sec><sec id="s4" sec-type="materials|methods"><title>Materials and methods</title><sec id="s4-1"><title>Mice</title><p>The Institutional Animal Care and Use Committee at Mayo Clinic approved all animal studies performed in this article. <italic>Abcb7<sup>fl</sup>/Abcb7<sup>fl/fl</sup></italic>(<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Clarke et al., 2006</xref>).

Cells were sorted at 4°C into PBS and immediately used for RNA extraction.</p></sec><sec id="s4-6"><title>RNA purification, cDNA synthesis, and quantitative PCR</title><p>B cells were FACS sorted as described above. Sorted cells were lysed using QIAshredder spin-columns (Qiagen, Hilden, Germany) and total RNA was then extracted and purified using a RNeasy Mini Kit (Qiagen), both according to the manufacturer’s instructions. Purified RNA was eluted from the columns using RNase-free water. cDNA was synthesized from purified RNA with random hexamers using a SuperScript IV First-Strand Synthesis System kit (Thermo Fisher) according to the manufacturer’s instructions. After cDNA synthesis, RNA was removed using RNase H, as described in the SuperScript IV protocol. For analysis of <italic>Rag1</italic> and <italic>Rag2</italic> expression in Fr. B and Fr. C cells, cDNA was subjected to qPCR analysis using TaqMan probes specific for <italic>Rag1</italic> and <italic>Rag2</italic>. For analysis of <italic>Abcb7</italic> in FO and MZ B cells, cDNA was subjected to qPCR analysis using a TaqMan probe specific for <italic>Abcb7</italic>. Expression was normalized to that of an 18S rRNA TaqMan probe, and then normalized to expression in WT Fr. B cells or WT FO B cells. For analysis of V<sub>H</sub>7183 and V<sub>H</sub>J558 GLT expression in pro-B cells, cDNA was subjected to qPCR analysis using SYBR Green and forward and reverse primers specific for a non-coding region of either V<sub>H</sub>7183 or V<sub>H</sub>J558, as previously described (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Fuxa et al., 2004</xref>). Primers used are listed in Appendix 2. Expression of each GLT was normalized to the expression of the housekeeping gene <italic>Hprt</italic> and then normalized to expression in WT Fr. B cells. The <italic>Hprt</italic> primers are listed in Appendix 2. For qPCR assays, every sample was plated in triplicate as a technical replicate. All qPCR assays were performed on a StepOne Real-Time PCR System (Thermo Fisher) and analyzed using the delta-delta Ct (ΔΔCt) method. All primers were ordered from Integrated DNA Technologies (Coralville, IA), and all qPCR probes were ordered from Thermo Fisher.</p></sec><sec id="s4-7"><title>Pre-B CFU assay</title><p>To enumerate IL-7-dependent pre-B CFU in bone marrow cells, MethoCult M3630 media (STEMCELL Technologies, Vancouver, Canada) was utilized according to the manufacturer’s instructions. Briefly, single-cell suspensions of total bone marrow were prepared as described above and diluted in IMDM media containing 2% FBS to a concentration of 1 × 10<sup>6</sup> and 2 × 10<sup>6</sup> cells/mL. Two plating concentrations were used to account for seeding variability, as recommended by the manufacturer. To prepare the final culture concentrations, 400 μL of the cell suspensions were then added to 4 mL of the M3630 media to create a final cell concentration of 1 × 10<sup>5</sup> and 2 × 10<sup>5</sup> cells/mL. Samples were vigorously pulsed on a vortex. Bubbles were allowed to float for 5 min before 1.1 mL of the sample was drawn with a 16G needle syringe and distributed to the center of 35 mm dishes, in triplicate for each sample. Each sample dish was placed in a square 100 mm dish (with lid) along with one unlidded 35 mm dish containing water to maintain humidity. Cells were incubated for 8 days at 37°C in a 5% CO<sub>2</sub> incubator. After 8 days, pre-B cell colonies were counted as described in the manufacturer’s protocol, and colony numbers were averaged across the triplicate plates. Colony numbers from the 2 × 10<sup>5</sup> cell concentration are reported in the article.</p></sec><sec id="s4-8"><title>Analysis of mitochondria, iron accumulation, ROS, GSH, and lipid peroxides</title><p>For flow cytometric analysis of mitochondria, single-cell suspensions (5 × 10<sup>6</sup> cells) from bone marrow were incubated with 100 nM MitoTracker Green FM (#M7514) and 100 nM TMRM (#T668). Intracellular iron was quantified by incubating bone marrow cells with 5 μM Phen Green SK (#P14313) diacetate. Intracellular and mitochondrial ROS were detected by incubating bone marrow cells with 5 μM CellROX (#C10444) and 5 μM MitoSOX (#M36008) dyes, respectively. To detect the presence of lipid peroxides, bone marrow cells were incubated with 2 μM Bodipy 581/591C-11 (#D3861), which is specifically oxidized by lipid peroxides. GSH levels were quantified by incubating bone marrow cells with 4 μM ThiolTracker Violet (#T10095), which detects GSH. All dyes were purchased from Thermo Fisher. For labeling with each dye, dyes were diluted in PBS and incubated with cells for 30 min in a 37°C 5% CO<sub>2</sub> incubator. After incubation, cells were washed with PBS. Fc receptors were blocked with mouse/rat serum, and surface antigens and FVD were stained as described above. Because of fluorescence spillover from these dyes, a limited surface marker panel was utilized in these experiments: anti-mouse B220, anti-mouse CD19, anti-mouse CD43, and anti-mouse IgM. Pro-B cells were defined as B220<sup>+</sup> CD19<sup>+</sup> CD43<sup>+</sup> sIgM<sup>-</sup>.

The next day, cells were washed with PBS and Annexin V binding was analyzed as described above.</p></sec><sec id="s4-11"><title>DNA purification from magnetically enriched pro-B cells</title><p>Single-cell suspensions of total bone marrow were prepared as described above. Pro-B cells were then enriched using an EasySep Mouse Streptavidin RapidSpheres Isolation Kit (STEMCELL Technologies) according to the manufacturer’s instructions. The following biotinylated antibodies were used for negative selection of unwanted cells: CD11b (1:100), CD11c (1:100), CD4 (1:100), CD8 (1:500), GR-1 (1:100), IgM (1:100), NK1.1 (1:100), TCRγδ (1:100), and TCRβ (1:100). Note that IgM was included to eliminate IgM<sup>+</sup> pre-B, naïve, and recirculating B cells. For a positive control, splenic B cells were harvested from a WT mouse and subjected to a similar RapidSphere negative selection that did not include IgM antibodies. Purity was checked by using flow cytometry after magnetic separation. Genomic DNA was then isolated from enriched pro-B cells and splenic B cells using a DNeasy Blood and Tissue Kit (Qiagen) according to the manufacturer’s instructions. The concentration of DNA was determined using a Nanodrop spectrophotometer (Thermo Fisher) and adjusted so that all samples would have equivalent concentrations.</p></sec><sec id="s4-12"><title>Semiquantitative PCR analysis of heavy chain recombination</title><p>Analysis of heavy chain recombination was performed as previously described (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Angelin-Duclos and Calame, 1998</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib50">Li et al., 1993</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib71">Pelanda et al., 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib84">Schlissel et al., 1991</xref>). Briefly, genomic DNA from magnetically enriched WT and Mb1-cre ABCB7 cKO pro-B cells (described above) was adjusted to equivalent concentrations and then underwent threefold serial dilutions. Serially diluted DNA was then subjected to a PCR assay that detects recombination between specified V<sub>H</sub> gene families and the J<sub>H</sub>3 gene. This assay utilizes forward primers specific to either V<sub>H</sub>7183, V<sub>H</sub>3609, V<sub>H</sub>Vgam3.8, or V<sub>H</sub>J558 gene families and a reverse primer specific to the J<sub>H</sub>3 gene (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Angelin-Duclos and Calame, 1998</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib50">Li et al., 1993</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib71">Pelanda et al., 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib84">Schlissel et al., 1991</xref>). Three PCR products were expected depending on whether the recombination utilized the J<sub>H</sub>1, J<sub>H</sub>2, or J<sub>H</sub>3 genes; however, the largest product length is underrepresented due to product length. The primers used are listed in Appendix 2. Primers specific to actin were used as a loading control for each serial dilution and are listed in Appendix 2. DNA isolated from splenic B cells was used as a positive control for recombination events. DNA from a Rag2<sup>-/-</sup> pro-B cell line was utilized as a negative control. PCR was performed using OneTaq DNA polymerase and buffers for GC-rich DNA (#M0480L; New England Biolabs, Ipswich, MA). Each PCR reaction additionally included 200 μM dNTPs, and forward and reverse primers at 0.5 μM (actin) or 1 μM (V<sub>H</sub> and J<sub>H</sub>3 genes). For detection of actin, the reactions were incubated as follows: 95°C for 3 min, then 30 cycles of 95°C for 30 s, 55°C for 30 s, and 72°C for 60 s, and a final incubation at 72°C for 3 min. For detection of V<sub>H</sub>7183 and V<sub>H</sub>J558 recombination, the reactions were incubated as follows: 95°C for 3 min, then 45 cycles of 95°C for 45 s, 63°C for 45 s, and 72°C for 60 s, and a final incubation at 72°C for 15 min. For detection of V<sub>H</sub>3609 and V<sub>H</sub>Vgam3.8 recombination, the reactions were incubated as follows: 95°C for 3 min, then 45 cycles of 95°C for 45 s, 60°C for 60 s, and 72°C for 60 s, and a final incubation at 72°C for 10 min. PCR products were run on 1.25% agarose gels containing ethidium bromide and photographed using an Omega Lum G gel imager (Gel Company, Ramsey, MN). All PCR primers were ordered from Integrated DNA Technologies.</p></sec><sec id="s4-13"><title>EdU assay</title><p>EdU incorporation was analyzed using a Click-iT Plus EdU Alexa Fluor 488 Flow Cytometry Assay Kit (Thermo Fisher). Briefly, single-cell suspensions of bone marrow cells were prepared as described above. 1 × 10<sup>7</sup> cells were resuspended in complete media (RPMI, 10% FBS, 1% glutamine, 1% HEPES, 1% non-essential amino acids, 1% Pen/Strep, and 0.1% 2-ME) and plated in a 6-well plate. EdU was added to each well at a final concentration of 10 μM. A control well without EdU addition was also plated. Cells were incubated at 37°C for 3 hr in a 5% CO<sub>2</sub> incubator. After incubation, 3 × 10<sup>6</sup> cells were blocked (4°C, 10 min) with mouse/rat serum and surface antigens and FVD were labeled (4°C, 30 min) in PBS containing 1% BSA, as recommended by the manufacturer’s instructions. Cells were washed and then incubated (room temperature, 15 min) with EdU kit fixative. Cells were then washed with PBS containing 1% BSA and then permeabilized by incubating (room temperature, 15 min) with 1× EdU kit permeabilization buffer. Click-iT reaction cocktails were then prepared according to the manufacturer’s instruction. 500 μL of reaction cocktail was then added to each sample and incubated at room temperature for 30 min. After the Click-iT reaction, cells were then washed with 1× permeabilization buffer and incubated (4°C, 30 min) with intracellular antibodies specific for pH2A.X in 1× permeabilization buffer.

The FlowJo cell cycle analysis tool was used to quantify the proportion of cells in each cell phase.</p></sec><sec id="s4-15"><title>Class switch culture</title><p>Single-cell suspensions of splenocytes were prepared as described above. Splenic B cells were then enriched using an EasySep Mouse Streptavidin RapidSpheres Isolation Kit (STEMCELL Technologies) according to the manufacturer’s instructions. The following biotinylated antibodies were used for negative selection of unwanted cells: CD11b (1:100), CD11c (1:100), CD4 (1:100), CD8 (1:500), GR-1 (1:100), NK1.1 (1:100), TCRγδ (1:100), and TCRβ (1:100). After selection, B cells were labeled with 2.5 μM carboxyfluorescein diacetate succinimidyl diester (CFSE). Cells were cultured at 2.5 × 10<sup>5</sup>/mL in a 24-well plate and stimulated to class switch to different antibody isotypes as described previously (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Guikema et al., 2010</xref>). In detail, cells were cultured in complete media (RPMI, 10% stem cell-grade FBS, 1% glutamine, 1% HEPES, 1% non-essential amino acids, 1% Pen/Strep, and 0.1% 2-ME). Note that stem cell-grade FBS of the same lot (#10437028; Thermo Fisher) was utilized in each culture experiment as traditional FBS was found to inhibit class switching (a finding that was previously reported [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib98">Zaheen and Martin, 2010</xref>]). All culture conditions contained LPS (25 μg/mL; Millipore Sigma) and recombinant human BAFF (100 ng/mL; PeproTech, Cranbury, NJ). For their respective wells, the following were added to induce switching to different isotypes: for IgG1 switching, recombinant mouse IL-4 (20 ng/mL; PeproTech) was added; for IgG2a switching, IFNγ (25 ng/mL; PeproTech) was added; for IgG2b switching, TGF-β (2 ng/mL; PeproTech) was added; for IgG3 switching, anti-δ-dextran (3 ng/mL; Fina Biosciences, Rockville, MD) was added; for IgA switching, recombinant mouse IL-4 (20 ng/mL), TGF-β (2 ng/mL), anti-δ-dextran (3 ng/mL), and IL-5 (2 ng/mL; PeproTech) were added. Cells were cultured for 4 days at 37°C in a 5% CO<sub>2</sub> incubator. After culture, surface antigens and FVD were labeled for flow cytometry as described above. CFSE dilution and class switching were also analyzed using flow cytometry. Intracellular flow cytometry was utilized to analyze Ki-67 expression. For the assay analyzing cell death over time, aliquots of cells from an IgG1-stimulating culture were harvested each day and analyzed for FVD binding. The FlowJo proliferating modeling tool was used to quantify proliferation index and percent undivided after culture.</p></sec><sec id="s4-16"><title>Statistical analysis</title><p>Statistical methods used are listed in each figure legend.

The principal methods used for this study are conditional deletion of the gene encoding ABCB7 in developing and mature B cells coupled to fairly sophisticated analysis of the effects of this using flow cytometry. The authors report that deletion of the gene for ABCB7 in early B cell progenitors results in a dramatic block in B cell development at a stage where antibody heavy chain gene rearrangement and cell proliferation must occur in order for B cell development to progress. This block occurs despite normal expression of transcription factors that are required for early B cell development. However, antibody heavy chain gene rearrangement is strongly impaired in the absence of ABCB7, suggesting that iron has a crucial role in this process, which requires DNA recombination and repair. Consistent with these results, transgenic expression of a rearranged heavy chain gene at least partially restores B cell development from ABCB7-deficient B cell progenitors. This result argues that an inability to successfully rearrange the antibody heavy chain gene and generate heavy chain protein is a main cause of the block in B cell development resulting from loss of ABCB7 expression. Some evidence is also provided to support the conclusion that DNA replication and thus cell proliferation is compromised in the absence of ABCB7 due to an inability to repair replication-induced DNA damage. In contrast to the dramatic effects on B cell progenitor development, deletion of the gene for ABCB7 in mature B cells has little effect, suggesting that ABCB7 is not essential for B cell homeostasis.</p><p>This manuscript is well organized and well written. The quality of the data shown is excellent, and most of the conclusions made are strong supported by the results presented. These are considered as strengths of the manuscript. Another strength is the characterization of how the loss of ABCB7 affects key events during B cell development; this thorough and methodical and reveals some important insights regarding the processes affected. A weakness of the manuscript is that the effects of ABCB7 deletion on mature B cell homeostasis is less well characterized; a few more experiments could extend this data in meaningful ways. Another weakness is that the effects on antibody heavy chain gene rearrangement and DNA replication were not teased apart.</p><p>The work presented by Lehrke et al., has impact on our understanding of the role of iron availability for progression of B cell development. It would appear that the appropriate handling of iron in B cell progenitors is critical for it to potentially serve as a cofactor for proteins that mediate antibody gene rearrangement and DNA replication and repair.</p><p>A key question that arises from this study is whether DNA replication in addition to immunoglobulin heavy chain gene rearrangement are affected by the absence of ABCB7. The authors provide evidence that both processes are affected; yet if DNA replication was strongly impaired, why would transgenic expression of a rearranged heavy chain gene largely suppress the effects of ABCB deficiency? Part of the answer could be that the lesion in DNA replication remains and may slow cell proliferation without halting development. To address this, the authors could look at EdU incorporation by pro-B cells and pre-B cells in WT and ABCB cKO mice that both carry the HEL-Ig transgene. If lesions in DNA replication persist, it would further support conclusion that DNA damage during replication is in part responsible for the phenotype.</p><p>The authors used CD23-cre to delete the gene encoding ABCB7 in mature B cells and didn't see any strong phenotype, suggesting ABCB7 is less important in these cells relative to developing B cells. Given a largely negative result was obtained, it would seem important to use PCR or Western blot analysis to confirm that the gene encoding ABCB7 is efficiently deleted in mature B cells by CD23-cre. Going further, if the authors wish to solidify the conclusion that ABCB7 is less important in mature B cells, they could stimulate WT and cKO cells in culture with LPS without or with the appropriate cytokines and measure proliferation and class-switching. Negative results here would support the idea that ABCB7 is largely dispensable in mature B cells; defects would support the conclusion that ABCB7 is required for DNA replication/proliferation and/or class switching by mature B cells.</p><p><italic>Reviewer #2:</italic></p><p>The report by Lehrke et al., describes a phenotypic analysis of B-lymphocyte development in mice with conditional deletion of the ABCB7 gene. Deletion in early B-cell progenitors using a mb1-cre driver result in a dramatic block in B-cell development. In contrast, deletion of the gene in mature cells, using a CD23-cre mouse strain, do not appear to cause observe any dramatic effects on either peripheral cell numbers or iron content in the cells. The developmental block induced by deletion of the ABCB7 gene in early progenitors could be overcome by expression of a BCR transgene, indicating a recombination deficiency as underlying cause of the developmental disruption. In consistency with this, the progenitor B-cells displayed an increased level of pH2gX. However, this was most prominent in proliferating cells that normally do not undergo VDJ recombination. Therefore, the authors suggest that the developmental block is a result of increased general DNA damage.</p><p>While the experimental designs in many ways are elegant, there are certain aspect of the analysis that complicates the interpretation of the data. Despite that the authors claim that the major block in differentiation occurs in the fraction C to C', a major part of the downstream analysis is made on a combined C/C' population. Hence, it is difficult to determine if the phenotypes observed is a consequence of a shift in populations or effects directly related to the function of ABCB7. It is also hard to understand how the expression of a functional B-cell receptor should be sufficient to overcome a general increase in DNA damage. Neither do the authors provide any direct link between DNA repair and ABCB7 function.</p><p>Hence, while the report clearly shows that ABCB7 is essential for normal early B-cell development, the mechanism by which mitochondrial iron-glutathione transport is linked to B-cell differentiation remains largely elusive.</p><p>1: The authors might want to investigate the deletion efficiencies in the more mature cell populations. As deletion of an essential gene cause a dramatic selection pressure this might result in that mature cells represent progenitors that has retained one or two functional alleles. This can complicate the interpretation of the data. Could this possibly be a reason for the apparent heterogeneity in the cKo cells in Figure 2J and 3A? As no phenotype is observed in Fig3S1, the interpretation of the data in Figure 3S1 would also be easier upon verification of functional ABCB7 deletion.</p><p>2: The authors could consider to be more stringent with their interpretations of their data. For instance, the reduced fraction B numbers in mice carrying a CD23 driver is considered as &quot;largely unaffected&quot; despite a p-value of 0.006. In contrast, the authors state &quot; There was a trending, but not significant, decrease in HO-1 expression in Mb1-cre ABCB7 218 cKO pro-B cells (Figure 3B), confirming the previous findings that ABCB7 affects heme biosynthesis&quot;. indicating that a trend confirms a finding.</p><p>3: Much of the data analysis is obscured by the use of the combined C/C´ population. The authors claim that the C to C´ transition is targeted, hence in order to generate conclusive data, these populations should be analyzed separately. The data in figure 4S1B suffer from the same problem as this, as far as I can understand, is done on unsorted BM. In order to be informative sorted fraction B cells should have been seeded. The Y axis would benefit from inclusion of the number of seeded cells to be more informative.</p><p>4: I can be discussed if the term Wt can be used for a mix of different genotypes as done on this paper according to the MandM. This might explain the rather strange finding that the CD23 driver cause a significant reduction in fraction B cell numbers. This mixture of genotypes also generates rather strange statements such as the data are generated from 11 independent experiments (Figure legend 1C) despite that only 8 mice from each Ko is analyzed. It is also unclear what the data in the contour plots indicate, I guess one &quot;representative&quot; experiment. It is more stringent to use the average values with a std.</p><p><italic>Reviewer #3:</italic></p><p>In this manuscript by Lehrke et al., authors set out to describe the role of a poorly characterized cassette protein that regulates iron transport from mitochondria to cytosol. The lack of in depth scientific knowledge on how this molecule works makes it challenging for authors to develop their hypothesis. Nevertheless, authors elegantly show the developmental stage specific role of ABCB7 molecule in B cells. For the most part, experiments were designed and executed properly and controls are adequate. Authors show both positive and negative observations openly and their conclusion makes sense. However, the paper fails to explain how a redundant molecule that does not induce any pathological effects once knocked out (no apoptosis, no ferroptosis, no mitochondrial dysfunction, no ROS accumulation, no iron starvation) still manages to somehow affect a handful of genes only in a select subset of B cell precursors and create the demonstrated effects. It is not even clear whether the activities or biosynthesis of these genes/proteins that are differentially affected between knock out and wt are even influenced by iron homeostasis. Unbiased screening assays would have strengthened the manuscript by pointing out potential novel mechanisms or pathways.</p><p>Specific points:</p><p>General: Authors continuously use the word &quot;trending&quot; for statistically nonsignificant changes between groups. This is very confusing. If something is not significant, I do not see the point of highlighting that.</p><p>Figure 1: According to figure legend, number of repeats and number of mice used for each repeat is abnormally high. (eleven experiments with 8-17 mice per condition.) This makes hundreds of mice used. I do not see the rationale behind this many repeats considering that only handful of data points are actually shown in the figure and the findings are clear.</p><p>Figure 1 B: Showing absolute numbers is an ideal approach to support a hypothesis however, this strategy is impossible for bone marrow since unlike spleen which is a capsulated organ that can be meshed and counted as a whole bone marrow is not. So, flushing yields in bone marrow will depend on the amount of cutting on each end of the bone and the ability to capture the marrow without loss through needle flushing. While the data shown by authors is pretty significant and convincing, authors should also discuss that this method has limitations. Alternatively, authors can try to normalize by graphing each population as percentage of all viable isolated cells in their suspension.</p><p>Figure 1A-B: Authors build their manuscript on the observation of decreased Pro to Pre B (Fr C to C') cell in bone marrows of cKO mice. The contour plots on Figure 1A shows a slight change in percentages of Fraction C and C' however authors fail to highlight that point in the absolute cell number graph as both Fr. C and Fr. C' goes down in cell numbers. A blockage at a developmental stage is expected to increase the population before the blockage in which case this should be Fr.C. If authors see this as the selling point of the manuscript then they should show it more clearly. I suggest getting ratio of Fr. C over Fr. C' would help overcome the problems related to general hypocellularity in the bone marrow of cKO animals.</p><p>Figure 1 C: Gating of splenic B cell fractions should involve CD93 in order to discriminate the transitional cell pool which then can be further divided into T1-2-3 subpopulations using IgM and CD23. The gating strategy authors used is unconventional. If possible, it would be nice to see CD93 staining as well. Furthermore, using CD23 cre mouse will not be able to reveal the effects of ABCB7 KO in marginal zone and T1 cells which express little or no CD23. That limitation needs to be discussed in the text.</p><p>Figure 2 demonstrates convincing evidence on the effect of conditional KO in regulation of a select group of critical transcriptional mediators of pro to pre-B cell transition. While not necessary, an unbiased RNA seq experiment would have provided a far better portrait of the alterations in transcriptome level than qPCR experiments focusing on a handful of molecules.</p><p>Figure 3: The use of mitotracker green for general mitochondrial mass evaluation is not ideal. It has been shown multiple times that various factors including pH and mitochondrial dysfunction can affect the fluorescence intensity of mitotracker green. Authors should use fluorescent antibodies against specific mitochondrial markers such as VDAC-1, TOM-20 and COX-IV to comment on mitochondrial mass. Furthermore, TMRM staining alone does not give any idea about mitochondrial health. Changes in mitochondrial number between groups can easily cause shifts in TMRM intensity. Therefore, it needs to be normalized to exclude mitochondrial number in order to be used as a parameter that can detect mitochondrial performance. To do so, each sample needs to be divided into three groups. Groups need to be treated with either FCCP (basal staining indicator when mitochondria are depolarized) or oligomycin (maximum staining indicator when mitochondria are hyperpolarized) or nothing (unaltered current level) and TMRM values should be measured for each. Then using the formula 100x [ (MFI (untreated)- MFI(FCCP) )/ (MFI oligomycin)-MFI (FCCP)] percentage of maximum mitochondrial membrane potential used by each group can be found and this values are independent from the differences in mitochondrial numbers. I believe this may change the interpretation of results.</p><p>Figure 3: Authors should show under microscopy that Phen Green SK colocalizes with TMRM (or any other mitochondrial stain) in order to confirm the staining differences in Figure 1A are located to changes in mitochondrial levels. Occasionally, these dyes have nonspecific binding issues. This experiment will rule out that possibility.</p><p>Figure 3F: Mitochondrial ROS is not detected is a misleading claim (Page 13 lane268) I agree that the MitoSOX levels are identical between cKO and the control however, flow cytometry plots are relative for these dyes. Any mitochondria healthy or unhealthy produces some level of ROS and this is even thought to act as a part of normal physiology if the levels are within limits. So authors should amend this part.</p><p>Figure 4: It is a good idea to culture cells and measure Annexin levels which would rule out the possibility that apoptotic cells get cleared fast in bone marrow before they are detected. However, I think Annexin measurement at 16 h is not enough to make a statement. Authors should monitor viability using Live-Dead reagents at early and late time points (such as 3-6-9-12-16-24-48h or something like that) and graph changes. Additionally, commercially available apoptosis, necrosis kits that can detect early and late phases of apoptosis are available and can be beneficial to strengthen the statement.</p><p>Page 18, lane 377 onwards: It was not very clear how authors introduced the transgene to the mice for the reader. I figured out by looking at the methods section that this is actually crossbreeding the mice with MD4. However, it sounds from the text as if it was done through transfection. Authors should clearly state that they did cross breeding in this section to avoid any confusion. Also, the use of MD4 mice dates back to 1980s, I think the 1994 paper authors cited is not the original one. It should be a Goodnow paper as far as I remember, please double check.</p><p>Figure 7: Similar to Figure 2, authors hand pick a few markers to prove their point. While the selection is elegant and relevant, an unbiased approach would have been far more convincing. Furthermore, the list of markers tested are hard to follow and I did not understand why or how they get affected with slight change of iron levels? Are these molecules regulated by iron levels? How does iron relate to these changes? There is a gap in the story in here.</p></body></sub-article><sub-article article-type="reply" id="sa2"><front-stub><article-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.69621.sa2</article-id><title-group><article-title>Author response</article-title></title-group></front-stub><body><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Essential revisions:</p><p>1) Address question of how ABCB7 status impacts Ig H chain rearrangement, as some of the data presented support the role of ABCB7 in this process, while other data do not.

Please see our specific answers in the point-by-point response below. In brief, ABCB7-deficient pro-B cells have decreased heavy chain rearrangement, μHC expression, decreased proliferation, and increased DNA damage in proliferating cells. B cell development is rescued in Mb1-cre ABCB7 cKO mice when interbred with the MD4 HEL-Ig transgene. We found that proliferation was similar in B220<sup>+</sup>CD19<sup>+</sup>CD43<sup>+</sup>CD127<sup>+</sup> pro-B cells from Hel-Ig transgenic and HEL-Ig transgenic Mb1-cre ABCB7 cKO mice, although increased DNA damage persisted in the absence of ABCB7 (new Figure 9). Thus, the Hel-Ig transgene restores both Ig expression and proliferation. We believe this may be due to the differences in signals received by B220<sup>+</sup>CD19<sup>+</sup>CD43<sup>+</sup> pro-B cells in these strains of mice. While normally B220<sup>+</sup>CD19<sup>+</sup>CD43<sup>+</sup> pro-B cells receive signals through the pre-BCR, in HEL-Ig transgenic mice B220<sup>+</sup>CD19<sup>+</sup>CD43<sup>+</sup> pro-B cells express high levels of IgM and IgD on the cell surface. Analysis of proliferation of ABCB7-deficient splenic B cells under class switching conditions demonstrated that the severity of the defect depended upon the stimuli utilized (new Figure 8).</p><p>As to the cause for increased DNA damage in the absence of ABCB7, there is a direct link between ABCB7 and DNA repair, as the iron-sulfur clusters exported from the mitochondria by ABCB7 are cofactors in numerous DNA repair enzymes including DNA primase, all replicative DNA polymerases, the helicases Dna2, FancJ, and XPD, and the glycosylases Endo III and MutY <sup>1–9</sup>. Therefore, a disruption in iron-sulfur cluster levels may impair the function of one or numerous DNA repair enzymes in the absence of ABCB7.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>2) Provide additional experimental support for the conclusion that ABCB7 is of lower importance in mature B cells compared to developing B cells.

We have added qPCR data demonstrating efficient deletion of ABCB7 in follicular and marginal zone B cells from CD23-cre ABCB7 cKO mice. In new Figure 8, we now show that ABCB7 is important for splenic B cell proliferation and class switching after stimulation. These data demonstrate that ABCB7 is not required for peripheral B cell homeostasis, as the numbers and proportions of peripheral B cells were unchanged in CD23-cre ABCB7 cKO mice (Figure 1), but is important for proliferation and class switching.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>3) The conclusion that the major impact of ABCB7 occurs on the population C to C' developmental transition is not sufficiently convincing, based upon the results shown.

If lesions in DNA replication persist, it would further support conclusion that DNA damage during replication is in part responsible for the phenotype.</p></disp-quote><p>We thank the reviewer for these suggestions and have added these results in new Figure 9. Pro-B cells (defined by B220<sup>+</sup>CD19<sup>+</sup>CD43<sup>+</sup>CD127<sup>+</sup>) from Hel-Ig Mb1-cre ABCB7 cKO and HEL-Ig WT mice had equivalent proportions of EdU incorporation and similar cell cycle status as analyzed by DAPI. This is in contrast to Mb1-cre ABCB7 pro-B cells which had a reduced proportion of cells that incorporated EdU (Figure 7). Interestingly, similar to Mb1-cre ABCB7 cKO pro-B cells, HEL-Ig Mb1-cre ABCB7 cKO pro-B cells had greater pH2A.X expression in proliferating cells and reduced EdU gMFI, suggesting a slower rate of DNA replication and increased DNA damage as compared to Hel-Ig WT pro-B cells. Unlike ABCB7-deficient pro-B cells, HEL-Ig Mb1-cre ABCB7 cKO pro-B cells had normal Ki-67 expression compared to HEL-Ig WT pro-B cells. This suggests that the presence of the fully rearranged MD4 HEL-Ig transgenic BCR is able to rescue proliferation in the absence of ABCB7, despite the presence of DNA damage. We believe this may be due to differences in the signals received by pro-B cells in these different models. In HEL-Ig transgenic mice, fully rearranged IgM and IgD receptors are expressed on B220<sup>+</sup>CD19<sup>+</sup>CD43<sup>+</sup> pro-B cells at high levels; while in non-transgenic mice, pro-B cells signal through the pre-BCR, which is expressed at low levels. Therefore, we believe differences in BCR vs pre-BCR signaling may be responsible for the restored proliferation in HEL-Ig Mb1-cre ABCB7 cKO pro-B cells. In support of this, we observed that the extent of proliferation of ABCB7-deficient splenic B cells was dependent upon the stimulation conditions (new Figure 8).</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>The authors used CD23-cre to delete the gene encoding ABCB7 in mature B cells and didn't see any strong phenotype, suggesting ABCB7 is less important in these cells relative to developing B cells.

Negative results here would support the idea that ABCB7 is largely dispensable in mature B cells; defects would support the conclusion that ABCB7 is required for DNA replication/proliferation and/or class switching by mature B cells.</p></disp-quote><p>We thank the reviewer for their suggestion to stimulate peripheral B cells from CD23-cre ABCB7 cKO mice. We performed an analysis of proliferation and class switching in splenic B cells from CD23-cre ABCB7 cKO and littermate controls. Enriched CD19<sup>+</sup> cells from these mice were stimulated with LPS and various cytokines and/or anti-δ-dextran to induce activation, proliferation, and class switching to IgG1, IgG2a, IgG2b, IgG3, and IgA. Despite normal peripheral B cell homeostasis, ABCB7-deficient peripheral B cells had a striking defect in proliferation and class switching (new Figure 8). Interestingly, the severity of the defect in proliferation was highly dependent upon the stimulation conditions used, demonstrating that the type of stimuli received has differential effects on the extent of proliferation. Furthermore, ABCB7-deficient cells in these cultures had a larger proportion of undivided cells that lacked Ki-67 expression, suggesting these cells have lost proliferation potential (new Figure 8 —figure supplement 3). We hypothesize that the defect in class switching is largely a result of impaired proliferation, which has been described thoroughly in the literature <sup>10–14</sup>. No differences were observed in the expression of class switched antibody isotypes in the splenic B cells from CD23-cre ABCB7 cKO mice and littermate controls (new Figure 8 —figure supplement 1). Thus, while ABCB7 deficiency is dispensable for maintenance of splenic B cell numbers at homeostasis, ABCB7 is required for splenic B cell proliferation.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Reviewer #2:</p><p>The report by Lehrke et al., describes a phenotypic analysis of B-lymphocyte development in mice with conditional deletion of the ABCB7 gene. Deletion in early B-cell progenitors using a mb1-cre driver result in a dramatic block in B-cell development. In contrast, deletion of the gene in mature cells, using a CD23-cre mouse strain, do not appear to cause observe any dramatic effects on either peripheral cell numbers or iron content in the cells. The developmental block induced by deletion of the ABCB7 gene in early progenitors could be overcome by expression of a BCR transgene, indicating a recombination deficiency as underlying cause of the developmental disruption. In consistency with this, the progenitor B-cells displayed an increased level of pH2gX. However, this was most prominent in proliferating cells that normally do not undergo VDJ recombination. Therefore, the authors suggest that the developmental block is a result of increased general DNA damage.</p><p>While the experimental designs in many ways are elegant, there are certain aspect of the analysis that complicates the interpretation of the data. Despite that the authors claim that the major block in differentiation occurs in the fraction C to C', a major part of the downstream analysis is made on a combined C/C' population. Hence, it is difficult to determine if the phenotypes observed is a consequence of a shift in populations or effects directly related to the function of ABCB7. It is also hard to understand how the expression of a functional B-cell receptor should be sufficient to overcome a general increase in DNA damage. Neither do the authors provide any direct link between DNA repair and ABCB7 function.</p><p>Hence, while the report clearly shows that ABCB7 is essential for normal early B-cell development, the mechanism by which mitochondrial iron-glutathione transport is linked to B-cell differentiation remains largely elusive.</p><p>1: The authors might want to investigate the deletion efficiencies in the more mature cell populations. As deletion of an essential gene cause a dramatic selection pressure this might result in that mature cells represent progenitors that has retained one or two functional alleles. This can complicate the interpretation of the data. Could this possibly be a reason for the apparent heterogeneity in the cKo cells in Figure 2J and 3A? As no phenotype is observed in Fig3S1, the interpretation of the data in Figure 3S1 would also be easier upon verification of functional ABCB7 deletion.</p></disp-quote><p>As stated above, qPCR was performed and ABCB7 is efficiently deleted in follicular and marginal zone B cells from CD23-cre ABCB7 cKO mice. Thus, the lack of Phen Green quenching, indicative of iron overload, in splenic B cells in Figure 3 —figure supplement 1 is not due to lack of ABCB7 deletion in that model. While there is heterogeneity observed with Phen Green quenching in ABCB7-deficient pro-B cells, we believe that this simply indicates that time is needed to accumulate iron.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>2: The authors could consider to be more stringent with their interpretations of their data. For instance, the reduced fraction B numbers in mice carrying a CD23 driver is considered as &quot;largely unaffected&quot; despite a p-value of 0.006. In contrast, the authors state &quot; There was a trending, but not significant, decrease in HO-1 expression in Mb1-cre ABCB7</p><p>cKO pro-B cells (Figure 3B), confirming the previous findings that ABCB7 affects heme biosynthesis&quot;. indicating that a trend confirms a finding.</p></disp-quote><p>We have eliminated any discussion of trends and limited interpretation to observed changes with statistical significance of p &lt; 0.05.</p><p>As stated by Reviewer 3, it is impossible to completely isolate all the cells from the bone marrow. Based on their suggestions, we have analyzed the frequency of each developing B cell population in Figure 1. Based on frequency, there is no statistical difference in the frequency of Fr. B cells from Cd23-cre ABCB7 cKO mice as compared to controls. The analysis of absolute numbers of bone marrow cells has been moved to Figure 1 —figure supplement 1.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>3: Much of the data analysis is obscured by the use of the combined C/C´ population. The authors claim that the C to C´ transition is targeted, hence in order to generate conclusive data, these populations should be analyzed separately. The data in figure 4S1B suffer from the same problem as this, as far as I can understand, is done on unsorted BM. In order to be informative sorted fraction B cells should have been seeded. The Y axis would benefit from inclusion of the number of seeded cells to be more informative.</p></disp-quote><p>We agree and have clarified the text and figures to demonstrate that we believe that the better way to describe the B cell phenotype is that there is a defect initiating at the pro-B cell stage, leading to a severe loss of subsequent development stages. Regarding the pre-B CFU assay, we followed the manufacturer’s instructions to seed total bone marrow. This kit is designed to generate pre-B CFU, and sorting Fr. B cells would not have worked in this assay. In addition to IL-7 for robust expansion, Fr. B cells also require stromal cell support as well as Flt3 ligand and SCF signals, which are not provided by the pre-B CFU assay. To clarify the data, we have moved the pre-B CFU data Figure 2 —figure supplement 1 as it better supports failure to generate pre-B cells. We have also added the seeded cell density to the figure and figure legend.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>4: I can be discussed if the term Wt can be used for a mix of different genotypes as done on this paper according to the MandM. This might explain the rather strange finding that the CD23 driver cause a significant reduction in fraction B cell numbers. This mixture of genotypes also generates rather strange statements such as the data are generated from 11 independent experiments (Figure legend 1C) despite that only 8 mice from each Ko is analyzed. It is also unclear what the data in the contour plots indicate, I guess one &quot;representative&quot; experiment. It is more stringent to use the average values with a std.</p></disp-quote><p>We thank the reviewer for their comments and concern. As stated above, analysis of Hardy fractions as a percentage of live cells revealed that there was not a difference in the proportion of different Hardy fractions in the CD23-cre ABCB7 cKO mice.</p><p>We apologize for the confusion regarding the number of independent experiments and analyzed mice figure legends. Figure legends have been updated to clarify that the number of mice reported is the total number of mice analyzed across all independent experiments. Additionally, we have reanalyzed splenic B cell populations in Figure 1 at the suggestion of Reviewer #3. Therefore, the figure legend now reads “…contour plots are representative of seven independent experiments (total of 7-12 mice/group).” This indicates that seven independent experiments were performed, and over the course of these experiments a total of 7-12 mice/group were analyzed (e.g., 12 WT mice, 7 Mb1-cre ABCB7 cKO mice, and 8 CD23-cre ABCB7 cKO mice).</p><p>Contour plots are described as, “representative of n independent experiments.” By this we mean that contour plot data shown in a figure is visually equivalent to other independent replicates of that experiment. Throughout our manuscript, we show representative flow cytometry data and then quantify across experiments in a subsequent panel for rigor and reproducibility.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Reviewer #3:</p><p>Specific points:</p><p>General: Authors continuously use the word &quot;trending&quot; for statistically nonsignificant changes between groups. This is very confusing.

(eleven experiments with 8-17 mice per condition.) This makes hundreds of mice used. I do not see the rationale behind this many repeats considering that only handful of data points are actually shown in the figure and the findings are clear.</p></disp-quote><p>We apologize for the confusion regarding the number of independent experiments and analyzed mice figure legends. Figure legends have been updated to clarify that the number of mice reported is the total number of mice analyzed across all independent experiments. For example, a total of 6-11 mice/group were analyzed for Figure 1A (e.g., 11 WT mice, 7 Mb1-cre ABCB7 cKO mice, and 6 CD23-cre ABCB7 cKO mice). Unless otherwise stated in the figure legend, each data point on a bar graph represents one mouse. Please note that splenic B cell populations presented in Figure 1 have been updated to include the use of CD93/AA4.1 and the number of experiments and mice have been updated.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Figure 1 B: Showing absolute numbers is an ideal approach to support a hypothesis however, this strategy is impossible for bone marrow since unlike spleen which is a capsulated organ that can be meshed and counted as a whole bone marrow is not. So, flushing yields in bone marrow will depend on the amount of cutting on each end of the bone and the ability to capture the marrow without loss through needle flushing. While the data shown by authors is pretty significant and convincing, authors should also discuss that this method has limitations. Alternatively, authors can try to normalize by graphing each population as percentage of all viable isolated cells in their suspension.</p></disp-quote><p>We agree that any bone marrow harvest procedure has a limitation in that it is impossible to completely flush/remove all bone marrow cells, as cells may become trapped in the bones. To clarify, bone marrow was harvested by centrifugation<sup>15</sup> rather than needle flushing. We have found the centrifugation method provides a more thorough bone marrow harvest compared to needle flushing or crushing methods.</p><p>We have analyzed the Figure 1 bone marrow data by graphing each Hardy fraction population as a percentage of all viable cells isolated. Using cell frequency, there continues to be a striking difference in B cell development in Mb1-cre ABCB7 cKO mice. This analysis also demonstrated that the proportions of Hardy fractions in CD23-cre ABCB7 cKO mice were not statistically different.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Figure 1A-B: Authors build their manuscript on the observation of decreased Pro to Pre B (Fr C to C') cell in bone marrows of cKO mice. The contour plots on Figure 1A shows a slight change in percentages of Fraction C and C' however authors fail to highlight that point in the absolute cell number graph as both Fr. C and Fr. C' goes down in cell numbers. A blockage at a developmental stage is expected to increase the population before the blockage in which case this should be Fr.C. If authors see this as the selling point of the manuscript then they should show it more clearly. I suggest getting ratio of Fr. C over Fr. C' would help overcome the problems related to general hypocellularity in the bone marrow of cKO animals.</p></disp-quote><p>We agree and have altered the manuscript to state that the defect is in pro-B cells leading to a severe loss of pre-B cells, and subsequent stages. Because we observed a statistically significant decrease in Fr. B and Fr. C cell numbers in Mb1-cre ABCB7 cKO mice, we have clarified in the text that we believe the block in B cell development in these mice is generally occurring at the pro-B cell stage. We have also added the ratio of Fr. C and Fr. C’ cells. We found that compared to WT mice, Mb1-cre ABCB7 cKO mice had a significantly higher ratio of Fr. C cells over Fr. C’ cells (new Figure 1 —figure supplement 1B).</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Figure 1 C: Gating of splenic B cell fractions should involve CD93 in order to discriminate the transitional cell pool which then can be further divided into T1-2-3 subpopulations using IgM and CD23. The gating strategy authors used is unconventional. If possible, it would be nice to see CD93 staining as well. Furthermore, using CD23 cre mouse will not be able to reveal the effects of ABCB7 KO in marginal zone and T1 cells which express little or no CD23. That limitation needs to be discussed in the text.</p></disp-quote><p>We thank the reviewer for their suggestion and comments. We have updated Figure 1 to include CD93 (AA4.1) and a different gating strategy for splenic B cells.

As described above, we analyzed expression of a human CD5 reporter that is linked to CD23-cre expression via an IRES. We did not observe robust huCD5 reporter expression in T1 B cells, as expected. The reporter was expressed in T2, T3, and FO B cells.

It has been shown multiple times that various factors including pH and mitochondrial dysfunction can affect the fluorescence intensity of mitotracker green. Authors should use fluorescent antibodies against specific mitochondrial markers such as VDAC-1, TOM-20 and COX-IV to comment on mitochondrial mass. Furthermore, TMRM staining alone does not give any idea about mitochondrial health. Changes in mitochondrial number between groups can easily cause shifts in TMRM intensity. Therefore, it needs to be normalized to exclude mitochondrial number in order to be used as a parameter that can detect mitochondrial performance. To do so, each sample needs to be divided into three groups. Groups need to be treated with either FCCP (basal staining indicator when mitochondria are depolarized) or oligomycin (maximum staining indicator when mitochondria are hyperpolarized) or nothing (unaltered current level) and TMRM values should be measured for each. Then using the formula 100x [ (MFI (untreated)- MFI(FCCP) )/ (MFI oligomycin)-MFI (FCCP)] percentage of maximum mitochondrial membrane potential used by each group can be found and this values are independent from the differences in mitochondrial numbers. I believe this may change the interpretation of results.</p></disp-quote><p>We have added flow cytometry analysis of VDAC1 expression and found similar expression in ABCB7-deficient pro-B cells as compared to WT pro-B cells (new panel in Figure 3). Thus, there is similar mitochondrial mass by either MitoTracker Green and VDAC1 expression, providing support that the lack of difference in TMRM staining is not due to alterations in mitochondrial mass.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Figure 3: Authors should show under microscopy that Phen Green SK colocalizes with TMRM (or any other mitochondrial stain) in order to confirm the staining differences in Figure 1A are located to changes in mitochondrial levels.

This is because Phen Green is a general cell dye that brightly stains the both the cytosol and organelles.
