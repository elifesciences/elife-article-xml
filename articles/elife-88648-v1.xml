based on the nature and familiarity of environments. To investigate this question, we developed a fully automated variant of the Barnes maze, characterized by 24 vestibules distributed along the periphery of a circular arena, and monitored the trajectories of mice over 15 days as they learned to navigate towards a goal vestibule from a random start vestibule. We show that the patterns of vestibule visits can be reproduced by the combination of three stochastic processes reminiscent of random, serial, and spatial strategies. The processes randomly selected vestibules based on either uniform (random) or biased (serial and spatial) probability distributions. They closely matched experimental data across a range of statistical distributions characterizing the length, distribution, step size, direction, and stereotypy of vestibule sequences, revealing a shift from random to spatial and serial strategies over time, with a strategy switch occurring approximately every six vestibule visits. Our study provides a novel apparatus and analysis toolset for tracking the repertoire of navigation strategies and demonstrates that a set of stochastic processes can largely account for exploration patterns in the Barnes maze.</p></abstract><kwd-group kwd-group-type="author-keywords"><kwd>navigation strategy</kwd><kwd>automated maze apparatus</kwd><kwd>stochastic processes</kwd><kwd>mixture model</kwd><kwd>markov chain model</kwd><kwd>genetic algorithm</kwd></kwd-group><kwd-group kwd-group-type="research-organism"><title>Research organism</title><kwd>Mouse</kwd></kwd-group><funding-group><award-group id="fund1"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100003725</institution-id><institution>National Research Foundation of Korea</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>2021R1A2C3005560</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Royer</surname><given-names>Sebastien</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund2"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100003693</institution-id><institution>Korea Institute of Science and Technology</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>2E32211</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Royer</surname><given-names>Sebastien</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><funding-statement>The funders had no role in study design, data collection and interpretation, or the decision to submit the work for publication.</funding-statement></funding-group><custom-meta-group><custom-meta specific-use="meta-only"><meta-name>Author impact statement</meta-name><meta-value>A set of stochastic processes reproduces the mouse exploration patterns in an automated variant of the Barnes maze.</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta specific-use="meta-only"><meta-name>publishing-route</meta-name><meta-value>prc</meta-value></custom-meta></custom-meta-group></article-meta></front><body><sec id="s1" sec-type="intro"><title>Introduction</title><p>The neural mechanisms underlying navigation strategies have received considerable interest from both experimental and theoretical research (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">Nyberg et al., 2022</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib43">Poucet and Hok, 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Bicanski and Burgess, 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Erdem and Hasselmo, 2014</xref>). However, the fact that multiple strategies might be used within the same environment adds another layer of complexity to this problem (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">Packard and McGaugh, 1996</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Berthoz, 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Arleo and Rondi-Reig, 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Iglói et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Chersi and Burgess, 2015</xref>). How navigation strategies are selected is an intriguing question that needs to take into consideration several factors. One important factor is the nature and availability of spatial cues, which can largely vary between environments. Wide open fields such as deserts or city plazas are believed to promote vector-based strategies that rely on distal landmarks and the elaboration of a cognitive map (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Bicanski and Burgess, 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">O’Keefe and Nadel, 1978</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Bush et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib43">Poucet and Hok, 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Buzsáki and Moser, 2013</xref>), whereas intricate networks of channels/streets should privilege response-egocentric or sequential-egocentric strategies that rely on local cues and memory of left/right turns (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">Packard and McGaugh, 1996</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib54">Save and Poucet, 2000</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib50">Rondi-Reig et al., 2006</xref>). Another factor is the level of familiarity with the environment. Exploratory behaviors are expected to predominate in novel environments, whereas vector-based navigation and egocentric strategies should progressively increase as animals become more familiar with landmark layouts and routes to goals, respectively. Additionally, the motivational factors driving animal motion in the environment, such as reward-seeking, threat-avoidance, and uncertainty resolving, can also affect navigation strategy (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">Packard and McGaugh, 1996</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Huang et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib56">Shamash et al., 2021</xref>).</p><p>The Barnes maze provides a suitable platform for examining the repertoire of strategies and the shift in strategy that accompanies learning of the environment (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Barnes, 1979</xref>). In this task, rodents explore a circular arena until they find an escape box located under one of several holes distributed along the arena periphery. Simple criteria are commonly used to classify the strategy employed in each trial, which are largely based on the number of visited holes and the assumption that the same strategy is maintained across an entire trial (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Bach et al., 1995</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib59">Suzuki and Imayoshi, 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Negrón-Oyarzo et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Gawel et al., 2019</xref>). However, it is largely unclear whether these criteria are valid and accurately capture the full range of strategies used.</p><p>To address these issues, we developed an automated variant of the Barnes maze and performed learning, probe test, and reversal learning experiments commonly carried out in Barnes mazes. Furthermore, we developed new analytical tools to characterize the statistical patterns of vestibule visits; generated vestibule sequences via stochastic processes intuitively compatible with random, serial, and spatial strategies; and demonstrate that a combination of these stochastic processes can largely account for vestibule visit patterns. These amount to a new method for tracking navigation strategies based on the relative weights of stochastic processes, which we used to demonstrate a shift from random to spatial and serial strategies across days and a strategy turnover period of approximately six vestibule visits.</p></sec><sec id="s2" sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><sec id="s2-1"><title>Automated maze</title><p>We developed a fully automated maze apparatus allowing to randomize the start and goal positions of individual trials without the need for experimenter intervention (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1a</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1</xref>).

However, unlike typical Barnes mazes where orienting cues are external to the maze and animals start at the center of the maze, our maze features two luminous objects inside the arena as orienting cues and start positions are located at the periphery of the arena.</p></sec><sec id="s2-2"><title>Behavioral protocol</title><p>For a first block of 15 days (acquisition phase), mice performed 10 trials per day. In each trial, they entered the maze from a randomly chosen start position and navigated to the goal position to consume a water reward. After the 15 days, a probe test was conducted, during which the goal door remained closed and mice were allowed to explore the arena for 2 min. Next, for another block of 4 days (reversal phase), mice performed the same task as in the initial block of 15 days, but the goal position was changed. We recorded behavioral data from 10 male and 9 female mice (C57BL/6, 7–8 weeks old), and since very similar patterns were observed for the two groups, we pooled and analyzed the data together in the main figures (male and female groups are analyzed separately in the supplementary figures).</p></sec><sec id="s2-3"><title>Segmentation of spatial trajectories</title><p>To analyze the spatial behavior of mice, we decomposed their trajectories into segments that spanned from one vestibule to another, as mice tended to explore the arena and visit multiple vestibules before reaching the goal. To accomplish this, we first detected vestibule visits, and then measured the number of door-intervals each segment spanned, considering the direction of travel associated with the shortest distance. A segment could span from 1 to 12 door-intervals in either the clockwise or counterclockwise direction (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2a</xref>). Positive door-interval values represented clockwise directions, while negative values represented counterclockwise directions.</p><fig-group><fig id="fig2" position="float"><label>Figure 2.</label><caption><title>Statistical characterization of vestibule sequences across days.</title><p>(<bold>a</bold>) Top view of the maze (left) and two example trajectories on top of an overlay of multiple trajectories (right) showing vestibules and trajectory segmentation.

We found that the path length of individual trials decreased across days, with the largest drop observed between day 1 and day 2 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s2">Figure 2—figure supplement 2a</xref>), consistent with previous reports in the Barnes maze (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib59">Suzuki and Imayoshi, 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Koopmans et al., 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">O’Leary and Brown, 2013</xref>). However, the path length of individual segments did not show substantial change across days when comparing segments of equivalent spans and directions (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2b</xref>), suggesting that the overall decrease in trial path length was more associated with a decrease in the number of vestibule visits rather than an alteration of running paths. Next, we calculated the trial length (number of segments per trial). We found that the average trial length decreased across days, with the largest drop observed between day 1 and day 2 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s2">Figure 2—figure supplement 2b</xref>). The distribution of trial lengths showed a peak for short trials followed by a progressive decline toward longer trials (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2c</xref>). The proportion of short trials became higher across days, at the expense of longer trials, consistent with the average decrease in trial length.</p><p>To determine whether mice relied on allocentric spatial information to learn the goal location, we analyzed the proportion of visits to each vestibule, expecting to see an increasing concentration of visits near the goal location over time. Although no preference was observed on day 1, mice progressively showed a preference for the goal vicinity in subsequent days, supporting their use of allocentric cues to locate the goal (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2d</xref>). To further validate this finding, we measured the time mice spent in each quadrant of the arena and in each vestibule during the probe test. The percentage of time spent in the goal-containing southwest (SW) quadrant was significantly higher than chance (p=2.54 × 10<sup>−4</sup>, two-sided Wilcoxon sign-rank test) and other quadrants (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s3">Figure 2—figure supplement 3a</xref>, p&lt;0.001, two-tailed paired <italic>t</italic>-test), and the percentage of time spent in the goal vestibule was significantly higher than chance (p=0.009, two-sided Wilcoxon sign-rank test) and other vestibules (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s3">Figure 2—figure supplement 3b</xref>, p&lt;0.05, two-tailed paired <italic>t</italic>-test), confirming that mice relied on allocentric cues to learn the goal location.</p><p>In the Barnes maze, mice occasionally exhibit a search strategy called serial, where they visit consecutive holes in series. To determine the extent of this behavior, we calculated the length of segments (the number of door-intervals they spanned; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2a</xref>). On day 1, there was a high proportion of short segments (1–2 door-intervals), consistent with the use of serial strategy (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2e</xref>, <italic>F</italic><sub>2,108</sub>=3.66, p=0.03, two-way ANOVA). This proportion increased over subsequent days, indicating an increased reliance on serial strategy (14.09 ± 5.81 %, 17.50 ± 5.39%, 18.96 ± 6.1% for day 1, day 2, and day 6–15, respectively; p=0.001 for day 1 vs day 2, and p=0.002 for day 1 vs day 6–15, two-tailed paired <italic>t</italic>-test).</p><p>Interestingly, we found that the peak of the segment length distribution was more than three times (3.56±1.13 time, across days) larger for the clockwise than the counterclockwise direction, indicating that the serial strategy was mostly used in the clockwise direction. This was likely due to the vestibules' orientation, which determined mice body orientation as they left a vestibule, matching the clockwise direction. When we switched the orientation of the vestibules, we observed a reversal of the animals' serial visit direction from clockwise to counterclockwise (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s4">Figure 2—figure supplement 4</xref>).</p><p>Additionally, we computed the length of serial bouts, defined as the number of consecutive one-door-interval-long segments, and found that the proportion of serial bouts sharply decayed as a function of serial bout length, with 1-segment-long bouts accounting for 82.62 ± 13.16% of the bouts on day 1 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2f</xref>). The proportion of longer bouts was increased across days, consistent with an increased usage of serial strategy (17.38 ± 13.16%, 29.34 ± 17.14%, 32.68 ± 11.38% for day 1, day 2, and days 6–15, respectively).</p></sec><sec id="s2-5"><title>Statistical characteristics of spatial trajectories across trials</title><p>To determine if the pattern of vestibule visits changed across individual trials within a session, we pulled together the data from days 6 to 15 and performed the same analyses as in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2</xref> for individual trials (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s1">Figure 3—figure supplement 1</xref>).

To address this aspect, we implemented a Markov chain model where strategies were nodes of a Markov chain and potentially changed after each vestibule visit according to a specific set of transition probabilities, and where vestibules were chosen based on the same stochastic processes as in the mixture model, though the clockwise and counterclockwise directions of the serial strategy were treated as distinct strategies (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6a</xref>).

In general, automated behavioral apparatuses reduce experimenter interference and ensure consistency across time and individuals (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib41">Pioli et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib65">Zhang et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Holleman et al., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">Mei et al., 2020</xref>). To change start positions, the whole arena is rotated to align home boxes with new start positions. Although environmental cues mainly consist of objects within the arena as it is isolated by a tinted cover, it is worth noting the possible influence of external factors such as room sounds and odors, which could introduce conflicting information across trials. Additionally, our maze design may not be conducive to experiments involving wired implants due to the enclosed nature of the arena and boxes. Instead, researchers can explore alternative approaches such as pharmacogenetics and wireless methods for optogenetic and electrophysiological studies. Our maze is similar to the Barnes maze but has distinct features such as vestibules in front of the doors, which made detection of vestibule visits relatively easy, and the use of two luminous objects in the arena for allocentric information. Despite these differences, we found that learning rates and spatial strategies were comparable to those reported in the Barnes maze (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib59">Suzuki and Imayoshi, 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Koopmans et al., 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">O’Leary and Brown, 2013</xref>). Furthermore, we found that mice had a preferred direction of rotation during the serial strategy, which was determined by the physical configuration of vestibules. Directional preference was observed in several other studies (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Fyhn et al., 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib58">Stackman et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Gillani et al., 2014</xref>), which may have also originated from environmental factors.</p><p>Our analyses of vestibule visits revealed that mice employed random, spatial, and serial search strategies. While these strategies have been previously considered (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Bach et al., 1995</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib59">Suzuki and Imayoshi, 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Negrón-Oyarzo et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Gawel et al., 2019</xref>), this is the first time that compatible stochastic processes are implemented and shown to complementarily account for exploration patterns. The spatial strategy likely used a form of allocentric navigation, given the distance of the two luminous landmarks from the goal, and may be divided into two phases: first, the learning of the environment and goal location, supported by the formation of a cognitive map in the hippocampal formation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">O’Keefe and Nadel, 1978</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Ekstrom et al., 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Grieves and Jeffery, 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib44">Poulter et al., 2018</xref>), achieved through competitive learning (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib49">Rolls et al., 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib57">Si and Treves, 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Kim et al., 2020</xref>), which provides the substrate for binding place and reward information (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib48">Robinson et al., 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">de Lavilléon et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Dupret et al., 2010</xref>). Second, the navigation to the goal, which may rely on vector navigation, where goal vectors (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib53">Sarel et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">Ormond and O’Keefe, 2022</xref>) are implemented via the comparison of grid cell codes for goal and current positions (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Bush et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Banino et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Boccara et al., 2019</xref>), or on topological navigation, where the trajectory to the goal emerges from signal propagation in the place cell network (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib42">Poucet, 1993</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">Muller et al., 1996</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib45">Redish and Touretzky, 1998</xref>), and may be assisted by lookahead mechanisms such as theta sweeps and/or ripple-associated replays (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Diba and Buzsáki, 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Davidson et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib62">Wikenheiser and Redish, 2015</xref>). The mechanism behind the serial strategy is less clear. The intense and systematic exploration of vestibules in this strategy may stem from a general association between vestibules and rewards. However, the repetitive left turns is reminiscent of egocentric responses supported by the dorsolateral striatum (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">Packard and McGaugh, 1996</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Devan and White, 1999</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib63">Yin et al., 2004</xref>), and thigmotaxis—an innate behavior enhanced by anxiety, where animals tend to stay close to walls while navigating open environments (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Huang et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Devan and White, 1999</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib61">Treit and Fundytus, 1988</xref>). Thus, the serial strategy might involve the combination of innate thigmotaxis-like behavior with associative learnings underlying vestibule-reward and left turn-reward associations. Finally, the random strategy might be related to exploratory behaviors and engage an ensemble of brain regions important for sensory integration, decision-making and reinforcement learning such as the hippocampus, prefrontal cortex, and basal ganglia (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Chersi and Burgess, 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib47">Roberts et al., 1962</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Hok et al., 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib64">Yin et al., 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Chakravarthy et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib46">Rinaldi et al., 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Dong et al., 2021</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib40">Pernía-Andrade et al., 2021</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Choi et al., 2021</xref>).</p><p>A shift in the proportion of random, spatial and serial strategies was observed across days. Several factors might contribute to this shift, including learning of the environment and goal location, changes in motivation for exploration versus goal-directed navigation, and the evaluation of each strategy’s benefit via reinforcement learning. The spatial strategy progressively increased, mostly at the expense of the random strategy. This trend suggests a diminishing interest in exploration and an increasing benefit from employing the spatial strategy as the mice became more familiar with the environment and goal location. Consistent with this hypothesis, the development of the spatial strategy approximately matched the development of spatial maps in the hippocampus (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Kim et al., 2020</xref>) and the growth pattern of hippocampal feedforward inhibitory connectivity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib52">Ruediger et al., 2011</xref>), both showing progressive increases that reached plateaus after a week. In contrast, the serial strategy showed a sudden increase from day 1 to day 2, indicating that this goal-directed strategy is associated with rapid learning and could already be reinforced on day 2. However, the strategy shift was not uniform across the mouse population, as male and female mice showed distinct trends. Female mice showed no progressive increase in spatial strategy and initially relied more on the spatial strategy while using the random strategy less compared to male mice. This difference might be explained by faster learning of goal location and/or a stronger inclination towards goal-directed navigation over exploration in female mice.</p><p>Maintaining the same strategy across several trials is particularly useful for successfully reaching the goal via the serial strategy, and might rely on mPFC working memory and strategy selection functions (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib60">Touzani et al., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib55">Schuck et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Guise and Shapiro, 2017</xref>). Our mixture model and experimental data were optimally matched when the same strategies were maintained for approximately six segments. Most trials comprised fewer than six segments (~60% and~66% of trials on day 1 and 15), thus involved the use of the same strategy throughout the whole trial. However, a substantial number of trials extended beyond six segments, thus involved switching between strategies. This suggests that commonly used methods for categorizing navigation strategy on a trial-by-trial basis may not accurately capture the full repertoire of strategies employed.</p><p>Our Markov chain model effectively replicated within-trial evolution of strategies, providing a more comprehensive insight into the probabilistic rules governing strategy selection. Interestingly, mice preferentially initiated trials with either the random or spatial strategy once they had learned the task. One possible explanation is that mice learned, through negative reinforcement, to avoid using the serial strategy at the start of trials, given that start positions were intentionally set to be at least 2 door-intervals away from the goal position. Furthermore, both spatial and serial strategies exhibited a relatively high probability of being reused in subsequent segments, consistent with the observed strategy continuity assessed with the mixture model. While the Markov chain model offered a more comprehensive understanding of strategy selection rules, it was considerably more computationally intensive than the mixture model, requiring up to 20 time more execution time. Therefore, in certain cases, such as tracking strategy repertoire across days, the mixture model might be more practical and preferable due to its computational efficiency.</p><p>In conclusion, we have developed a fully automated variant of the Barnes maze along with analytic tools allowing to track the repertoire of navigation strategies over time. Furthermore, we have demonstrated that a set of stochastic processes compatible with random, spatial and serial strategies could largely account for vestibule visit patterns. This achievement opens up future prospects for a comprehensive characterization of animal behavior, extending across various environments, behaviors and species. Our tools might be combined in the future with optogenetic, pharmacogenetic manipulations and/or wireless electrophysiology systems to investigate the neural mechanisms underlying strategy selection, whereas future work in silico might investigate neuronal network models generating exploration patterns equivalent to the stochastic processes.</p></sec><sec id="s4" sec-type="materials|methods"><title>Materials and methods</title><sec id="s4-1"><title>Experimental subjects</title><p>All experiments were conducted in accordance with institutional regulations (Institutional Animal Care and Use Committee of the Korea Institute of Science and Technology) and conformed to the Guide for the Care and Use of Laboratory Animals (NRC 2011).

The floor of the arena (a white acrylic disc 1-cm-thick and 95 cm wide) is supported by a mounted bearing (UC205-16, UCFT205-16) fixed to a central rod (2.54 cm-diameter, 23 cm-high, stainless steel) and by 4 wheels at a 14.5 cm distance from the periphery. One of the wheels is motorized (NEMA 17HS4401 Bipolar Stepper Motor) to control the rotation of the platform. The angular position of the floor is calculated from the motor increment signal and an LED-photodetector couple detecting the passages of 24 beam-breakers (2x0.5 × 20 mm plastic pieces) fixed under the floor at positions matching the arena doors.</p><p>The arena is enclosed by a 16-cm-high peripheral wall made of white acrylic (thickness: 0.3 cm) with 24 evenly distributed entrances 8 cm apart from each other. Each entrance consisted of a 5 cm hole with a flapping door made from a 3D printer (ABS, Stratasys/F120).</p><p>The entrance doors are normally closed, but following the alignment with a home box, are rotated into open positions throughout the opening of the box door. The arena is partitioned by 7-cm-high internal walls made of styrofoam blocks, on which a transparent-tainted acrylic cover (50-mm-thick) is laid to prevent mice from leaving the maze and seeing the room cues while allowing mouse tracking with infrared light.</p><p>The home boxes are made with a 3D printer (ABS, Stratasys/F120) and have motorized rotating doors, allowing mouse access to the maze, and an opening on the top, allowing experimenter access to the mice. Upon entering the box, mice have to turn ~180 degree around an internal wall to reach a water dispenser, ensuring that no body parts (such as the tail) remain near the door when it closes. An LED-photodetector couple triggers the water reward and door closure upon the mouse reaching the water dispenser.</p><p>The home boxes are coupled to the central axle of the maze through an aluminum arm and a mounted bearing. A motorized wheel fixed under the home boxes allows the home boxes to roll on an aluminum platform along the circumference of the arena. The angular position of the box is calculated from the motor increment signal and an LED-photodetector couple detecting the passages of 24 beam-breakers (2x0.5 × 20 mm plastic pieces) fixed under the aluminum platform at positions matching the arena doors.</p><p>To control the maze, a microcontroller (Arduino mega 2560) is used. The home box electronics are connected to the microcontroller through a long ribbon cable, which is placed inside a flexible plastic accordion pipe (148 cm-long, 25 mm-diameter) to prevent cable entanglement during the rotation of the boxes.</p></sec><sec id="s4-3"><title>Maze environment</title><p>For the spatial navigation task, the arena was accessed via angled vestibules, which limited the visibility of doors from within the arena (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1</xref>). Two luminous landmarks were placed on the arena, consisting of small (WxLxH, 5x5 × 5 cm) and large (10x15 × 5 cm) semi-transparent plastic boxes containing yellow and blue LEDs, respectively. They moved together with the arena when the arena was rotated.</p></sec><sec id="s4-4"><title>Task and maze operation</title><p>The task involved navigating from a random start position to a fixed goal position (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1b</xref>). At the beginning of each session, a mouse was placed in one of the home boxes. The start position was adjusted by rotating the arena floor until the box was aligned with the desired start position, while the goal position was set by moving the other box until it was aligned with the desired goal position. The doors of the boxes opened to let the mouse navigate the maze and then closed when the mouse reached the lick port of the other box. For most trials, the box containing the mouse remained still while the other box and arena floor were moved. However, both boxes were moved when the rotation angle of one of the boxes was going to exceed 180° to limit the twisting of electric cables. All these steps were carried out automatically using a program uploaded to a microcontroller using Arduino IDE 1.8.19.</p><p>Mice performed a total of 10 trials per session, for 19 sessions (1 session per day), with a distinct sequence of random start positions for each session. The goal position was kept the same for sessions 1–15 and then changed for sessions 16–19. The same sequence of start positions and the same goal positions were used for all mice. Start positions were randomly selected among vestibules at least 2 door-intervals away from the goal position.</p></sec><sec id="s4-5"><title>Probe test</title><p>Probe tests were carried out 3 hr after the task, on day 15. The mice were placed in the arena and allowed to explore freely for 2 min, with all arena doors closed. The maze area was divided into 24 equal zones, with the goal position at the center of one of the zones. The time spent in each zone and quadrant was measured using Ethovision (Noldus, Spink, &amp; Tegelenbosch, 2001).</p></sec><sec id="s4-6"><title>Trajectory tracking</title><p>Animal behavior was recorded using an infrared video camera (Basler acA1300-60gm, 25 frame/s) and infrared lights (AP-XM722-WAB-U4), and synchronized with task signals from the microcontroller using the software Ethovision (Noldus, Spink, &amp; Tegelenbosch, 2001). Mouse position tracking and further analyses were implemented in MATLAB (MathWorks Inc, MA, USA). Video frames from a period without the mouse (the period between stopping the rotations of the boxes/arena floor and the opening of the door) were used to compute an average baseline frame that was subtracted from subsequent video frames with the mouse on the arena. For each frame, pixels delineating the mouse area were detected (using a threshold) within a circular region (radius: 7 cm) centered initially on the start position and then on the previous mouse position. The mouse area was longitudinally divided into four equal segments, and the center of mass xy-coordinates were computed for each segment, allowing a tracking of mouse position and body orientation. For each trial, the xy-coordinates were rotated to align the maze environment and goal position across trials.</p></sec><sec id="s4-7"><title>Trajectory segmentation</title><p>On each trial, mice often visited several vestibules before reaching the goal box. We divided each trial’s trajectory into two distinct components: vestibule visits and running segments between vestibules. We defined vestibule entrances and exits as the points where the mice crossed a radial distance threshold of 47.5 cm from the center of the arena.</p></sec><sec id="s4-8"><title>Path length</title><p>Mouse displacement was computed for each time step based on Euclidean distance and integrated over the entire trajectory to obtain the path length. We measured path length for both individual trials and individual segments, defined as the path between two vestibules.</p></sec><sec id="s4-9"><title>Trial length</title><p>The trial length was defined as the number of segments in a trial.</p></sec><sec id="s4-10"><title>Segment length and direction</title><p>The segment length was defined as the number of doors it spanned, considering the travel direction associated with the smallest number. Each segment could span from 1 to 12 doors, either in a clockwise or counterclockwise direction (see <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2a</xref>). A positive value of segment length indicated a clockwise direction, while a negative value indicated a counterclockwise direction.</p></sec><sec id="s4-11"><title>Serial bout length</title><p>For each trial, we calculated the length of segments and identified consecutive 1-door-long segments, which we defined as serial bouts. We measured the length of serial bouts as the number of segments in the group, with a minimum length of 1 segment corresponding to single, isolated 1-door-long segments.</p></sec><sec id="s4-12"><title>Stochastic process for random strategy</title><p>To model the pattern of vestibule visits, stochastic processes were implemented to choose which of the vestibules was visited next (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4a</xref>). For the random strategy, the identity of the next vestibule was randomly drawn from the uniform distribution in the range [1–24], using MATLAB function randi to generate uniformly distributed pseudorandom integers in the range [1–24].</p></sec><sec id="s4-13"><title>Stochastic process for spatial strategy</title><p>For the spatial strategy, the identity of the next vestibule was randomly drawn from a distribution P that exponentially decayed as a function of goal distance (number of door-intervals between the vestibule and the goal). The distribution P was characterized by two symmetrical negative exponentials exp(-x/tau) that decayed as a function of leftward/rightward goal distance. An integer was randomly drawn from the uniform distribution in the range [1 sum_of_the_distribution_P]. The goal distance was determined by the position x for which the cumulative sum of the distribution P reached the value of the integer. The decay rate (tau) of the exponentials was heuristically set to 2 through comparison of experimental and simulated data (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figures 2</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">4</xref>). Importantly, we assumed that the next vestibule could not be the same as the current vestibule for this goal oriented strategy. Therefore the stochastic process was run again if the current vestibule was selected as the next vestibule.</p></sec><sec id="s4-14"><title>Stochastic process for serial strategy</title><p>For the serial strategy, the identity of the next vestibule was determined by incrementing the current vestibule number by a stochastically determined step.</p><p>The serial strategy could occur in either the clockwise or counterclockwise direction. For the mixture model, a unified process integrating both directions was implemented. The sign of the step was randomly drawn, with an 80% (20%) probability of being positive (negative), which indicated a step in the clockwise (counterclockwise) direction. Specifically, an integer x was randomly drawn from the uniform distribution in the range [0 100]. If x&lt;80, the sign was positive, otherwise it was negative.</p><p>The size of the step was obtained by adding a random jitter to an offset value (1.2 and –2 for clockwise and counterclockwise directions, respectively). The jitter was randomly drawn from the normal distribution, using MATLAB function randn to generate normally distributed pseudorandom numbers, and was multiplied by a standard deviation value (1.2 and 1.5 for clockwise and counterclockwise directions, respectively).</p><p>The values of offsets, standard deviations, and sign probabilities were heuristically determined through comparison of experimental and simulated data (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figures 2</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">4</xref>). Specifically, for the two peaks observed in the segment length distribution, the offsets determined the positions of the peaks, the standard deviation determined the width of the peaks, and the sign probabilities determined the ratio of the height of the peaks.</p><p>As for the spatial process, we assumed that the next vestibule could not be the same as the current vestibule, so the stochastic process was rerun if the current vestibule was selected as the next vestibule.</p></sec><sec id="s4-15"><title>Mixture model</title><p>We implemented a mixture model that combine three strategies (random, spatial and serial) to simulate the pattern of vestibule visits (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5a</xref>). Each strategy was assigned a specific probability (P_random, P_spatial, P_serial) for a given simulation. To select the strategy, an integer x was randomly drawn from the uniform distribution in the range [0 100]. The strategy was random if x&lt;P_random; it was serial if x&gt;P_random +P_spatial; otherwise, the strategy was spatial.</p><p>The mixture model assumed that mice use the same strategy throughout a specific number N of consecutive vestibules. At the beginning of a trial, a strategy was randomly selected, and its associated stochastic process was recursively used to draw the next N vestibules. This process was repeated: the strategy was randomly selected again to draw the next N vestibules until the goal was reached.</p><p>We ran simulations of the mixture model for the same number of mice and trials as in the experiments, and used the same start positions as in the experiments.</p></sec><sec id="s4-16"><title>Estimation of strategy proportion and number N of consecutive vestibules for the mixture model</title><p>To determine the optimal probability values for each strategy (P_random, P_spatial, P_serial), we conducted a comprehensive simulation study, exploring a wide range of probability combinations. Specifically, we tested values of P_random, P_spatial, and P_serial ranging from 0 to 100 (percent) with an increment of 2, while ensuring that their sum was always equal to 100. For each combination of probabilities, we used the same analytical methods as in the experimental analysis and computed the mean square error between the simulated and experimental distributions. We selected the optimal probability values as those that produced the lowest mean square error between the simulated and experimental distributions.</p><p>To determine P_random, P_spatial and P_serial for each of the 19 days, all simulations and error calculations were repeated for each day, using the same number of mice, trials and the same start positions as in the experiments.</p><p>To determine the optimal number N of consecutive vestibules, we repeated all simulations and error calculations for values of N ranging from 1 to 15 and selected the value associated with the lowest mean square error between the simulated and experimental distributions (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5c</xref>).</p></sec><sec id="s4-17"><title>Markov chain model</title><p>The model incorporated four strategies: random, spatial, serial clockwise and serial counterclockwise. To generate vestibule sequences, the model iteratively draw a strategy and then a vestibule using the stochastic process associated with the selected strategy, repeating this operation until the goal (vestibule 0) was reached. At the beginning of the trials, the strategy was drawn according to a set of probabilities determining the initial strategy (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6a</xref>, left). Otherwise, the model transitioned between strategies based on another set of probabilities (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6a</xref>, right).</p></sec><sec id="s4-18"><title>Genetic algorithm</title><p>A genetic algorithm was employed to estimate the probabilities for both the initial strategy and strategy transitions in the Markov chain model. It iteratively refined probability values to minimize mean square errors between experimental and simulated distributions.</p><p>The algorithm operated with a population size of 500 individuals, with each individual representing a 5x4 probability matrix. The first row stored the probabilities for the initial strategy, while the subsequent rows stored the probabilities for strategy transitions. Initial values in individuals' probability matrices were randomly assigned.</p><p>The algorithm ran for 500 generations. In each generation, vestibule sequences and mean square errors between experimental and simulated distributions were computed for each individual. The 250 individuals with the lowest mean square errors were selected as the ‘best’ and passed to the next generation. The next generation was complemented by a new set of 250 individuals, formed by either mutating the best individuals or mixing elements from pairs of the best individuals. Mutation and mixing operations alternated in every other generation.</p><p>Mutation involved adding random values (−0.1–0.1) to each element of the probability matrix. Negative values were set to 0, and normalization ensured probabilities remained in the range of 0–1 and summed to 1 across strategies. Mixing elements from pairs of individuals involved combining randomly selected subsets of rows from one individual with complementary subsets from another individual.</p><p>The final probability matrix was obtained by averaging the matrices of the 250 best individuals from the 500th generation. The reliability of the results was assessed by observing similar convergence of parameters across 10 repetitions of the algorithm.</p></sec><sec id="s4-19"><title>Statistical analysis</title><p>All statistical analyses were performed in Matlab (MathWorks). Number of animals were similar to those generally employed. For each distribution, a Kolmogorov-Smirnov test was used to test the null hypothesis that the sample distribution was derived from a standard normal distribution. If normality was uncertain, we used non-parametric tests as stated in the main text or figures. Otherwise, Student t-tests were used to test the sample mean. Correlations were computed using Pearson’s correlation coefficient.</p></sec></sec></body><back><sec sec-type="additional-information" id="s5"><title>Additional information</title><fn-group content-type="competing-interest"><title>Competing interests</title><fn fn-type="COI-statement" id="conf1"><p>No competing interests declared</p></fn></fn-group><fn-group content-type="author-contribution"><title>Author contributions</title><fn fn-type="con" id="con1"><p>Conceptualization, Data curation, Formal analysis, Investigation, Methodology, Writing – original draft, Writing – review and editing</p></fn><fn fn-type="con" id="con2"><p>Methodology, Writing – review and editing</p></fn><fn fn-type="con" id="con3"><p>Conceptualization, Data curation, Formal analysis, Supervision, Funding acquisition, Investigation, Methodology, Writing – original draft, Writing – review and editing</p></fn></fn-group><fn-group content-type="ethics-information"><title>Ethics</title><fn fn-type="other"><p>All experiments were conducted in accordance with institutional regulations (Institutional Animal Care and Use Committee of the Korea Institute of Science and Technology) and conformed to the Guide for the Care and Use of Laboratory Animals (NRC 2011).</p></fn></fn-group></sec><sec sec-type="supplementary-material" id="s6"><title>Additional files</title><supplementary-material id="mdar"><label>MDAR checklist</label><media xlink:href="elife-88648-mdarchecklist1-v1.pdf" mimetype="application" mime-subtype="pdf"/></supplementary-material></sec><sec sec-type="data-availability" id="s7"><title>Data availability</title><p>The data that were collected for this study, as well as all the codes for data analysis and modeling are available at <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://github.com/sebiroyerlab/Vestibule_sequences">GitHub</ext-link> (copy archived at <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib51">Royer, 2024</xref>).</p></sec><ack id="ack"><title>Acknowledgements</title><p>This work was supported by the Korea Institute of Science and Technology Institutional Program (Project #

They consider a set of models and conclude that the animals begin with a large proportion of random choices (choices irrespective of the goal location), which over days of experience becomes a combination of spatial choices (choices targeted around the goal location) and serial choices (successive stepwise choices in a given direction). Moreover, the authors show that after the animal has many days of experience in the maze, they still often began each trial with a random choice, followed by spatial or serial choices.</p><p>This study is written concisely and the results are presented concisely. The best fit model provides valuable insight into how the animals solve this task, and therefore offers a quantitative foundation upon which tests of neural mechanisms of the components of the behavioral strategy can be performed.

A major strength is the novel and clever experimental design which rotates the floor and intramaze cues before the start of each new trial, allowing the previous goal location to become the next starting position. The modelling sampling a Markov chain of navigation strategies is elegant, appropriate and solid, appearing to capture the behavioural data well.

The system's design has been thoughtfully considered, encompassing numerous intricate details.

They consider a set of models and conclude that the animals begin with a large proportion of random choices (choices irrespective of the goal location), which over days of experience becomes a combination of spatial choices (choices targeted around the goal location) and serial choices (successive stepwise choices in a given direction). Moreover, the authors show that after the animal has many days of experience in the maze, they still often began each trial with a random choice, followed by spatial or serial choices.</p><p>This study is written concisely and the results are presented concisely. The best fit model provides valuable insight into how the animals solve this task, and therefore offers a quantitative foundation upon which tests of neural mechanisms of the components of the behavioral strategy can be performed. These tests will also benefit from the automated nature of the task.</p><p><bold>Reviewer #2 (Public Review):</bold></p><p>This paper uses a novel maze design to explore mouse navigation behaviour in an automated analogue of the Barnes maze. A major strength is the novel and clever experimental design which rotates the floor and intramaze cues before the start of each new trial, allowing the previous goal location to become the next starting position. The modelling sampling a Markov chain of navigation strategies is elegant, appropriate and solid, appearing to capture the behavioural data well. This work provides a valuable contribution and I'm excited to see further developments, such as neural correlates of the different strategies and switches between them.</p><p><bold>Reviewer #3 (Public Review):</bold></p><p>Strength:</p><p>The development of an automated Barnes maze allows for more naturalistic and uninterrupted behavior, facilitating the study of spatial learning and memory, as well as the analysis of the brain's neural networks during behavior when combined with neurophysiological techniques. The system's design has been thoughtfully considered, encompassing numerous intricate details. These details include the incorporation of flexible options for selecting start, goal, and proximal landmark positions, the inclusion of a rotating platform to prevent the accumulation of olfactory cues, and careful attention given to atomization, taking into account specific considerations such as the rotation of the maze without causing wire shortage or breakage. When combined with neurophysiological manipulations or recordings, the system provides a powerful tool for studying spatial navigation system.</p><p>The behavioral experiment protocols, along with the analysis of animal behavior, are conducted with care, and the development of behavioral modeling to capture the animal's search strategy is thoughtfully executed. It is intriguing to observe how the integration of these innovative stochastic models can elucidate the evolution of mice's search strategy within a variant of the Barnes maze.</p><p>Comments on revised version:</p><p>The authors have addressed all the points I outlined in the previous round of review, resulting in significant improvements to the manuscript. However, I have one remaining comment. Given the updated inter-animal analysis (Supplementary Figure 8), it appears that male and female mice develop strategies differently across days. Male mice seem to progressively increase their employment of spatial strategy across days, at the expense of the random strategy. Conversely, female mice exhibit both spatial and serial strategies at their highest levels on day 2, with minimal changes observed on the subsequent days.</p><p>These findings could alter the interpretation of Figure 5 and the corresponding text in the section &quot;Evolution of search strategy across days&quot;.</p><p>For instance, this statement on page 6 doesn't hold for female mice: &quot;The spatial strategy was increased across days, ... largely at the expense of the random strategy.&quot;</p></disp-quote><p>We agree with the reviewer. While the text on page 6 is still valid for the male-female pooled data, we have clarified in the next section describing male-female differences that this trend is not observed in female. Furthermore, we adjusted the relevant part of the discussion the following manner:</p><p>“A shift in the proportion of random, spatial and serial strategies was observed across days. Several factors might contribute to this shift, including learning of the environment and goal location, changes in motivation for exploration versus goal-directed navigation, and the evaluation of each strategy’s benefit via reinforcement learning. The spatial strategy progressively increased, mostly at the expense of the random strategy. This trend suggests a diminishing interest in exploration and an increasing benefit from employing the spatial strategy as the mice became more familiar with the environment and goal location. Consistent with this hypothesis, the development of the spatial strategy approximately matched the development of spatial maps in the hippocampus37 and the growth pattern of hippocampal feedforward inhibitory connectivity62, both showing progressive increases that reached plateaus after a week. In contrast, the serial strategy showed a sudden increase from day 1 to day 2, indicating that this goal-directed strategy is associated with rapid learning and could already be reinforced on day 2. However, the strategy shift was not uniform across the mouse population, as male and female mice showed distinct trends. Female mice showed no progressive increase in spatial strategy and initially relied more on the spatial strategy while using the random strategy less compared to male mice. This difference might be explained by faster learning of goal location and/or a stronger inclination towards goal-directed navigation over exploration in female mice.”</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p><bold>Recommendations for the authors:</bold></p><p><bold>Reviewer #1 (Recommendations For The Authors):</bold></p><p>Minor points:</p><p>(1) The following sentence in the abstract is not grammatical: &quot;The processes randomly selected vestibules based on either uniform (random) or biased (serial and spatial) probability distributions; closely matched experimental data across a range of statistical distributions characterizing the length, distribution, step size, direction, and stereotypy of vestibule sequences; and revealed a shift from random to spatial and serial strategies over time, with a strategy switch occurring approximately every 6 vestibule visits.&quot;</p><p>One possible revision is: &quot;The processes randomly selected vestibules based on either uniform (random) or biased (serial and spatial) probability distributions; [they] closely matched experimental data across a range of statistical distributions characterizing the length, distribution, step size, direction, and stereotypy of vestibule sequences, [revealing] a shift from random to spatial and serial strategies over time, with a strategy switch occurring approximately every 6 vestibule visits.&quot;</p></disp-quote><p>We followed the reviewer’s suggestion.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>(2) There is a missing word in the following sentence in the last paragraph of the discussion: &quot;Our tools might be combined in the future with optogenetic and/or pharmacogenetic [missing word here] to investigate the neural mechanisms underlying strategy selection&quot;</p></disp-quote><p>We added the word ‘manipulations’: ‘… optogenetic, pharmacogenetic manipulations …’</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p><bold>Reviewer #2 (Recommendations For The Authors):</bold></p><p>I have two minor suggestions:</p><p>(1) Results - Automated Maze section: It would be beneficial to clarify here that the floor and cues rotate allowing automation by chining start/end positions together. This information is key to the reader understanding the task and currently they would only know this by studying fig1 or delving into the methods</p></disp-quote><p>As suggested by the reviewer, we have added the following text in the Results - Automated Maze section:</p><p>“The maze consist of an enclosed arena with an array of 24 doors evenly spaced along the periphery, and two home boxes moving around the arena perimeter. Start positions are changed by rotating the arena and the home boxes (Fig. 1b). Furthermore, the arena has a tinted cover that prevents mice from seeing room cues while still allowing for infrared tracking of mouse trajectories.”</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>(2) I still find the author's decision to exclude days from some of the line plots, e.g. days 3,4,5 from Fig2 etc, a little odd as this makes the reader wary. I appreciate their argument about clarity, but this can still be achieved while partitioning all of the data rather than excluding certain days. NB I do not find the heat map distributions in the far panel a particularly good substitute for this as pixel intensities are far less interpretable</p></disp-quote><p>We appreciate the reviewer’s comment. We want to point out that line plots for all individual days are actually displayed in Supplementary Figure 7a.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p><bold>Reviewer #3 (Recommendations For The Authors):</bold></p><p>Although the difference between females and males is clear in Figure S8b, please note that the statistics in panels C and D might not be appropriate, as many of them may become insignificant if adjusted for multiple comparisons.</p></disp-quote><p>If we understand correctly, a Bonferroni correction would need to consider the 3 day intervals in Figure S8c and the 2 day groups in Figure S8d. This would mean a significance threshold of 0.05/3 = 0.016667 for Figure S8c and 0.05/2 = 0.025 for Figure S8d, after Bonferroni correction. As it stands, all comparisons that are not labelled ’ns’ in Figure S8c-d remain significant even after applying the Bonferroni correction.</p></body></sub-article></article>
