Gene regulation is highly dynamic and context-dependent. In order to better understand the connection between gene regulation and complex phenotypes, including disease, we need to be able to study gene expression in more cell types, tissues, and states that are relevant to human phenotypes. In particular, we need to characterize gene expression in early development cell types, as mutations that affect developmental processes may be of particular relevance to complex traits. To address this challenge, we propose to use embryoid bodies (EBs), which are organoids that contain a multitude of cell types in dynamic states. EBs provide a system in which one can study dynamic regulatory processes at an unprecedentedly high resolution. To explore the utility of EBs, we systematically explored cellular and gene expression heterogeneity in EBs from multiple individuals. We characterized the various cell types that arise from EBs, the extent to which they recapitulate gene expression in vivo, and the relative contribution of technical and biological factors to variability in gene expression, cell composition, and differentiation efficiency. Our results highlight the utility of EBs as a new model system for mapping dynamic inter-individual regulatory differences in a large variety of cell types.</p></abstract><abstract abstract-type="executive-summary"><title>eLife digest</title><p>One major goal of human genetics is to understand how changes in the way genes are regulated affect human traits, including disease susceptibility. To date, most studies of gene regulation have been performed in adult tissues, such as liver or kidney tissue, that were collected at a single time point. Yet, gene regulation is highly dynamic and context-dependent, meaning that it is important to gather data from a greater variety of cell types at different stages of their development. Additionally, observing which genes switch on and off in response to external treatments can shed light on how genetic variation can drive errors in gene regulation and cause diseases.</p><p>Stem cells can produce more cells like themselves or differentiate – acquire the characteristics – of many cell types. These cells have been used in the laboratory to research gene regulation. Unfortunately, these studies often fail to capture the complex spatial and temporal dynamics of stem cell differentiation; in particular, these studies are unable to observe gene regulation in the transient cell types that appear early in embryonic development. To overcome these limitations, scientists developed systems such as embryoid bodies: three-dimensional aggregates of stem cells that, when grown under certain conditions, spontaneously develop into a variety of cell types.</p><p>Rhodes, Barr et al. wanted to assess the utility of embryoid bodies as a model to study how genes are dynamically regulated in different cell types, by different individuals who have distinct genetic makeups. To do this, they grew embryoid bodies made from human stem cells from different individuals to examine which genes switched on and off as the stem cells that formed the embryoid bodies differentiated into different types of cells. The results showed that it was possible to grow embryoid bodies derived from genetically distinct individuals that consistently produce diverse cell types, similar to those found during human fetal development.</p><p>Rhodes, Barr et al.’s findings suggest that embryoid bodies are a useful model to study gene regulation across individuals with different genetic backgrounds. This could accelerate research into how genetics are associated with disease by capturing gene regulatory dynamics at an unprecedentedly high spatial and temporal resolution. Additionally, embryoid bodies could be used to explore how exposure to different environmental factors during early development affect disease-related outcomes in adulthood in different individuals.</p></abstract><kwd-group kwd-group-type="author-keywords"><kwd>iPSC</kwd><kwd>embryoid bodies</kwd><kwd>single cell</kwd><kwd>scRNA-seq</kwd></kwd-group><kwd-group kwd-group-type="research-organism"><title>Research organism</title><kwd>Human</kwd></kwd-group><funding-group><award-group id="fund1"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000050</institution-id><institution>National Heart, Lung, and Blood Institute</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>Ruth L.

To understand regulatory and functional effects of trait-associated variants, it is necessary to perform molecular assays in the relevant cell types at the relevant stages of development, and potentially to also model different environmental exposures (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Umans et al., 2020</xref>).</p><p>However, most efforts to identify genetic variants that regulate gene expression (expression quantitative trait loci, or eQTLs) have relied on adult tissue samples collected at a single time point. While such efforts have mapped millions of static, steady-state eQTLs across dozens of tissues and cell types (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">GTEx Consortium, 2020</xref>), most disease-associated variants were not found to also be classified as eQTLs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">Yao et al., 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Aguet et al., 2017</xref>).</p><p>It is possible that dynamic and variable regulatory genetic effects, including those that are specific to a given cell type, time point, or environment, may underlie the mechanisms for many unexplained phenotypic associations. For example, recent efforts to characterize gene regulatory dynamics in human induced pluripotent stem cells (iPSCs) and their derived cell types have identified dynamic eQTLs that are associated with disease risk, supporting the intuitive notion that changes in gene regulation during development may play a role in shaping human adult phenotypes, including disease (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Strober et al., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Cuomo et al., 2020</xref>). Still, iPSCs are limited in their potential for identifying dynamic regulatory effects. The number of cell types that can be obtained from iPSCs using directed differentiation protocols is quite modest, and time-course experiments, although useful for studying gene regulation at discrete points along a continuum, are inefficient, expensive, and laborious to perform.</p><p>With these challenges in mind, we wanted to develop and characterize a new in vitro model for studying gene regulation – a model capable of measuring gene expression continuously along the developmental trajectories towards multiple cell types, and to be able to do so in multiple individuals. To do this, we used iPSCs to form embryoid bodies (EBs), which are three-dimensional aggregates of spontaneously and asynchronously differentiating cells. EB formation has been used to verify stem cell pluripotency for decades; yet, until recently, the complexity of EB cellular composition has precluded their use in genomic studies. With single-cell RNA-sequencing (scRNA-seq), it is now possible to characterize the numerous spatially and developmentally distinct cell types within EBs, including transient cell types that would otherwise be inaccessible. Indeed, recent scRNA-seq studies of human EB differentiation have revealed the diversity of cell types composing these structures and the transcriptional dynamics governing early fate decisions (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Han et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Guo et al., 2019</xref>).</p><p>To date, however, the only studies that have sequenced EB cells have relied on a small sample of cells from a single individual, leaving a gap in our understanding of technical, biological, and inter-individual variation present in this system (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Han et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Guo et al., 2019</xref>). Understanding the sources of variation that affect cell composition and scRNA-seq data from EBs is crucial for evaluating the utility of EBs as a novel system for population-level studies of gene regulation. To this end, we used a batch-controlled study design to generate and sequence EBs from multiple individuals using multiple replicates. This allowed us to measure the degree of technical and biological variability in cell identity and gene expression levels associated with repeated independent EB differentiations. We evaluated the consistency in cell type composition across replicates and individuals, characterized the structure of variation in gene expression across the entire data set, and finally, captured patterns of dynamic gene expression along distinct developmental trajectories. Our results indicate that scRNA-seq of differentiating EBs has the potential to be a powerful model system for the study of inter-individual variation in gene regulation across an array of functionally and temporally diverse cell types.</p></sec><sec id="s2" sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><p>We have performed a pilot study to establish and characterize the EB system. Toward the ultimate goal of performing dynamic eQTL studies using EBs, we designed a study that allowed us to effectively estimate different sources of variation in single-cell data from EBs. In this pilot study, we focused on consistency of the non-directed differentiation process, and the proportion of gene expression variability that can be explained by technical or biological factors.</p><sec id="s2-1"><title>Study Design, data collection, and preprocessing</title><p>To characterize sources of variation in gene expression in human EBs, we initially differentiated EBs from three human iPSC lines (18511, 18858, and 19160) in three replicates (see Materials and methods). We performed the experiment in three batches, where each batch includes one replicate from each of the three individuals. EBs differentiate quickly, with cell types representing endoderm, mesoderm, and ectoderm present after 8 days (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Han et al., 2018</xref>). In this study, we maintained EBs for 3 weeks after formation, allowing cells to continue to differentiate and mature. After 21 days, we collected scRNA-seq data, targeting equal numbers of cells from each individual in each replicate. After filtering and quality control (Materials and methods), we retained high-quality data from a sample of 42,488 cells (an average of 4721 cells per individual/replicate). For these cells, we obtained a median of 16,712 UMI counts per cell, which allowed us to measure the expression of a median of 4274 genes per cell (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1</xref>). We integrated data from all cells using Harmony, which anchors the data sets by cell type (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Korsunsky et al., 2019</xref>)⁠.</p><p>After these initial collections, we found that one individual, 18858, had lower differentiation efficiency than the other two lines (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1G</xref>, see Differentiation efficiency across individuals). Too assess the robustness of differentiation efficiency and cell type composition among a larger sample of individuals from our YRI iPSC panel, we differentiated EBs in one replicate from each of five additional randomly chosen lines (18856, 18912, 19140, 19159, and 19210). After filtering and quality control, we retained an average of 5243 cells per individual in this new set of data, a median of 5983 UMI counts per cell, and a median of 2775 genes per cell (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s4">Figure 1—figure supplement 4</xref>). Throughout the text, when we use data from the five lines that were subsequently collected using only a single replicate (18856, 18912, 19140, 19150, and 19210), we refer to them as the ‘additional lines’. The initial replicated data collected from individuals 18511, 18858, and 19160 are used in all analyses throughout this study, while the additional lines are used only to demonstrate consistency of cell type composition across individuals.</p><fig-group><fig id="fig1" position="float"><label>Figure 1.</label><caption><title>Characterization of EB cell type composition using marker gene expression and clustering.</title><p>(<bold>A–F</bold>) Visualization of EB cells with UMAP.

We found cells expressing markers for endoderm (<italic>SOX17</italic>, <italic>FOXA2</italic>), mesoderm (<italic>HAND1</italic>), and ectoderm (<italic>PAX6</italic>), in addition to cells still expressing pluripotency markers (<italic>POU5F1</italic>, <italic>MYC</italic>, <italic>NANOG</italic>). We visualized the data with uniform manifold approximation and projection (UMAP) and observed that cells expressing each of these germ layer markers occupied distinct groups in UMAP space (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1A–D</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Becht et al., 2018</xref>). Moreover, we found that every replicate in our experiment, regardless of the individual, includes cells from all three germ layers (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1E and G</xref>).</p><p>We next sought to further explore the heterogeneous cell types present in these EBs. In studies of scRNA-seq data from tissues and samples with well-characterized cell type composition, clustering is often applied to demarcate populations of pure cell types within heterogeneous samples. In these studies, clustering resolution, which determines the number of clusters identified by the algorithm, is typically chosen to recapitulate the expected number of known cell types. The identified clusters can be annotated based on the expression of known marker genes.</p><p>In our case, however, we had no a priori knowledge of the exact number or types of cells that would result from the spontaneous differentiation of the EBs. Hence, we used three complementary approaches to annotate cells, capturing various perspectives on what might define a cell type in this data set. First, we identified cell types by clustering cells and annotating the cell types based on the genes that are highly expressed in each cluster. Second, we annotated cell types by considering the correlation of gene expression in our data with a reference data set of known primary cell types. For our third approach, we used a different perspective, and applied topic modeling to consider a less discrete definition of cell type.</p><p>For the first approach, we used a standard clustering analysis, the Louvain algorithm in Seurat, to identify groups of cells with similar transcriptomes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Blondel et al., 2008</xref>). To avoid making assumptions about the true number of cell types present, we repeated this analysis across different clustering resolutions (resolution 0.1, 0.5, 0.8, and 1). As expected, the number of clusters we identified varied greatly depending on the resolution (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1E–F</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s2">Figure 1—figure supplement 2</xref>). We performed each subsequent analysis using clusters defined at multiple resolutions, to ensure that our qualitative conclusions are robust with respect to the number of clusters identified.</p><p>For each clustering resolution, we calculated pseudobulk gene expression levels using cells from the same cluster, individual, and replicate. To identify marker genes expressed in each cluster, we used <italic>Limma</italic> and <italic>voom</italic> to perform differential expression analysis (Materials and methods) using the pseudobulk estimates. For example, considering the gene expression data of the seven clusters identified at resolution 0.1, we found that the most significantly upregulated genes in each cluster included known marker genes for pluripotent cells (cluster 0), early ectoderm (cluster 1), mesoderm (cluster 2), neural crest (cluster 3), endoderm (cluster 4), neurons (cluster 5), and endothelial cells (cluster 6) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1E</xref>, <xref ref-type="table" rid="table1">Table 1</xref>). Using this approach provides a confident set of broad cell type categories present in these data. At higher resolutions, DE analysis between clusters enabled annotation of some more specific cell types; for example, at clustering resolution 1, cluster 19 is characterized by higher expression of hepatocyte marker genes FGB, TTR, and AFP. More generally, however, confident cell type classification of Seurat clusters at higher resolution based on DE alone proved difficult (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="supp4 supp5 supp6 supp7">Supplementary files 4-7</xref>).</p><table-wrap id="table1" position="float"><label>Table 1.</label><caption><title>Classification of Seurat cluster identity (clustering resolution 0.1) based on differential expression of marker genes.</title></caption><table frame="hsides" rules="groups"><thead><tr><th align="left" valign="bottom">Cluster (Res. 0.1)</th><th align="left" valign="bottom"># cells in cluster</th><th align="left" valign="bottom">Top 10 marker genes by adj.

We observed that reference hESCs cluster closely with pluripotent EB cells. We also observed that the hESC-derived EBs and our iPSC-derived EBs tend to occupy the same areas in UMAP space, implying high overall similarity in cell type composition despite differing protocols for EB differentiation (and despite the fact that the experiments were performed in different labs).

EB cells annotated as neurons based on our gene expression analysis overlap with fetal neuronal subtypes, including inhibitory neurons, excitatory neurons, granule neurons, ENS neurons, and others.

Specifically, we transferred cell annotations to EB cells based on the nearest reference cells in harmony-corrected PCA space (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2D</xref>). Using this approach, we found EB cells representing 66 of the 77 primary cell types present in the reference fetal data set (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="supp1">Supplementary file 1</xref>). The most common annotation was hESC (80% of EB cells); this can be partially attributed to the high proportion of pluripotent cells in our EB data set, but also to the fact that the reference fetal data set does not include many early developmental cell types. Indeed, many cells annotated as hESC here are likely to represent immature, differentiating cells which are no longer pluripotent but whose transcriptional profiles more closely match hESCs than the more highly differentiated fetal cell types present in the reference data set. In this sense, EB data sets may capture transient developmental cell types that are difficult or impossible to study even in fetal primary samples. Outside the hESCs, many fetal cell types are only represented by small populations of EB cells. For example, only one EB cell is annotated as a thymocyte, and only one cell is annotated as a myeloid cell. These observations indicate that, in the future, we can benefit from a deeper sampling of EB single cells in order to properly explore their true cell type composition. Overall, annotation based on the reference set revealed the presence of dozens of diverse cell types in EBs.</p></sec><sec id="s2-3"><title>Differentiation efficiency across individuals</title><p>To assess the differentiation efficiency of each individual in each replicate, we calculated the proportion of cells assigned to each cluster as resolution 0.1 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1G</xref>). While EBs from two of the individuals in our study differentiated efficiently across all replicates, we observed that 89% of cells from individual 18858 were assigned to cluster 0, the cluster annotated as pluripotent cells based on differential expression of marker genes (<xref ref-type="table" rid="table1">Table 1</xref>, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="supp3">Supplementary file 3</xref>). The EBs from this line do differentiate, producing high quality cells assigned to clusters representing each germ layer (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1G</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s3">Figure 1—figure supplement 3</xref>), but these EB have overall markedly lower differentiation efficiency than EBs from individuals 18511 and 19160. To determine whether individual 18858 is an outlier, and more generally estimate how often EB differentiation is less efficient, we differentiated an additional five human iPSC lines from individuals 18856, 18912, 19140, 19159, and 19210 (Materials and methods). We were reassured to find that EBs from additional lines differentiated efficiently, with cell type composition similar to 18511 and 19160 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1H</xref>). These results suggest that poor differentiation efficiency is expected to be rare among the YRI iPSC panel. We further explored the robustness of cell type composition by integrating the additional lines with the fetal and hESC reference data sets using the same methodology as was used for the original lines (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s1">Figure 3—figure supplement 1</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s2">Figure 3—figure supplement 2</xref>). We find that annotations assigned to cells from these additional lines represented 66/77 fetal cell types; this set of annotations included several cell types that were missing in the original three lines, but also excludes several that were seen in the original three lines (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="supp2">Supplementary file 2</xref>). Again, we observed that most EB cells from the additional lines are annotated as hESC (82% of cells), although many no longer express pluripotency markers and do express markers of various germ layers as we previously observed. Together, these results support our conclusions that EBs contain many diverse cell types, many of which likely capture earlier stages of development than are captured in fetal data.</p><fig-group><fig id="fig3" position="float"><label>Figure 3.</label><caption><title>Reference Integration and cell type annotation with additional lines.</title><p>(<bold>A</bold>) UMAP visualization of EB cells from this study and cells from reference data sets of fetal cell types, Day 20 EBs, and hESCs after integration.

Accordingly, each cell has a single true identity, and cell type categories are assumed to be homogeneous and static. This definition of a cell type is intuitive and makes it practical to consider results from single-cell analysis in the context of the wealth of knowledge previously gained from bulk assays. However, partitioning cells into discrete groups is unlikely to capture the full degree of heterogeneity in gene expression of single cells. A particular cluster or cell ‘type’ may collapse multiple cell states, obscuring functionally distinct subgroups such as cells in different stages of the cell cycle. This problem becomes more apparent in data sets that include differentiating cells, which are expected to show varying degrees of similarity to a terminal cell type. In an alternate paradigm, cell type can be viewed as continuous, with the expression profile of each cell representing grades of membership to multiple categories (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Dey et al., 2017</xref>). One method used to capture cell identity in this paradigm is topic modeling, which learns major patterns in gene expression within the data set, or topics, and models each cell as a combination of these topics. We applied topic modeling using <italic>fastTopics</italic> at a range of topic resolutions, identifying 6, 10, 15, 25, and 30 topics in our data. Some topics correspond closely to Seurat clusters, loaded on cells of a given cluster but not on others. For example, in the k = 6 topic analysis, topic 1 is loaded exclusively on cells assigned to Seurat cluster 4 (cluster resolution 0.1) which we previously annotated as endoderm (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figures 4A–D</xref>–<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">1E</xref>, <xref ref-type="table" rid="table1">Table 1</xref>).

Seurat clustering at higher resolution (resolution 1) results in further categorical division of this large endoderm group of cells into definitive endoderm and hepatocytes (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1F</xref>).

Here, ‘replicate’ corresponds to a batch of EB differentiations in which each cell line was differentiated, dissociated, and collected in tandem; ‘replicate’ therefore captures technical variation related to differentiation batch, dissociation batch, and single-cell collection batch. We began by calculating the proportion of cells that were assigned to each Seurat cluster at resolution 0.1 for each replicate. We then performed hierarchical clustering of the samples based on the proportion of cells in each Seurat cluster (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5s1">Figure 5—figure supplement 1</xref>). Using this approach, replicate-individual samples cluster first by individual, indicating that cell type composition is distinct between individuals and is consistent between replicates of each individual. We repeated this analysis at a range of cluster resolutions and determined that this finding is robust with respect to the number of clusters (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5s1">Figure 5—figure supplement 1</xref>).</p><p>We also repeated this analysis using topic loadings as a measure of cell type composition. We calculated the loading of each topic on each individual-replicate group and performed hierarchical clustering (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5s2">Figure 5—figure supplement 2</xref>). Again, we found that at varying values of k, samples generally cluster by individual, but using the higher resolution topic-based approach, we also observed substantial variation between replicates (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5s2">Figure 5—figure supplement 2</xref>). Individual 18858 always clusters away from the other two lines, due to the consistent and distinct distribution of cell types caused by low differentiation efficiency.</p><p>We further characterized determinants of variation in our system by considering factors that contribute to variation in gene expression levels. Hierarchical clustering of pseudobulk expression estimates of cells from the same Seurat cluster (res. 0.1), replicate, and individual shows that, as might be expected, samples tend to cluster first by cell type (Seurat cluster), then by individual and replicate (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5A</xref>). We performed variance partitioning using pseudobulk expression levels to estimate the relative contribution of cell type, individual, and replicate to overall patterns of gene expression variation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5B</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Hoffman and Schadt, 2016</xref>). We found that replicate and individual explained approximately equal proportions of the variance (each explains a median value of ~5% of variance). Cell type identity explained the largest proportion of variation at all clustering resolutions tested (variance explained median value ~60% at clustering resolution 0.1), although this figure is likely exaggerated since cell type identity is determined by clustering, which will inherently maximize variation between cell types. Depending on clustering resolution, a median value of approximately 20–30% of variance is explained by residuals, which can be attributed to noise or other technical variation not specifically modeled (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5s3">Figure 5—figure supplement 3</xref>). We then partitioned the variance in gene expression at single cell resolution (instead of using pseudobulk estimates) and found that replicate explains more variation on average than individuals, with cell type identity continuing to explain more variance than either (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5C</xref>). At single-cell resolution, residuals explain a median value of 93% of the variation, which is expected due to the high degree of variance (both biological and technical) in gene expression profiles among individual cells.</p><fig-group><fig id="fig5" position="float"><label>Figure 5.</label><caption><title>Exploration of the biological and technical variation in gene expression across EB cells.</title><p>(<bold>A</bold>) Heatmap showing hierarchical clustering of cells based on normalized gene expression.

Studies that incorporate a larger number of cells will increase representation of rare cell types, which will increase power to study patterns of gene regulation. In every cluster, variation due to replicate dominates the variation of certain genes but not others.

We manually traced high confidence trajectories through the data representing the progression from pluripotent cells to hepatocytes (clusters 0, 1, 5, 6, 7, 10, 11, 16, 18, 19, 25, and 22) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7B</xref>), pluripotent cells to endothelial cells (clusters 0, 1, 4, 5, 6, 7, 11, 16, 18, 22, 24, and 25) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7C</xref>), and pluripotent cells to neurons (clusters 0, 1, 2, 3, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 11, 12, 13, 14, 15, 16, 17, 18, 20, 21, 26, and 27) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7A</xref>). For groups of clusters with a higher degree of connectivity (e.g. clusters expressing pluripotent markers and clusters expressing early ectoderm markers), all clusters within the region with high connectivity were included in the trajectory to avoid choosing an arbitrary path through these clusters. Next, we applied split-GPM, an unsupervised probabilistic model, to infer dynamic patterns of gene expression within a particular developmental trajectory, while simultaneously performing clustering of genes and samples. Split-GPM is built for use with time course, bulk RNA-seq data; therefore, we calculated pseudobulk expression values for individual-replicate groups within decile bins of pseudo-time. We were able to identify gene modules with distinct dynamic patterns of expression along the trajectories to neurons, hepatocytes, and endothelial cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7s3">Figure 7—figure supplements 3</xref>–<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7s5">5</xref>).</p><p>Gene set enrichment analysis of these modules shows expected dynamic patterns (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7s3">Figure 7—figure supplements 3</xref>–<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7s5">5</xref>). For example, we found that gene modules that increase expression through pseudo-time along the differentiation trajectory to hepatocytes, which are the predominant cell type of the liver and are responsible for the production of bile, are enriched for the hallmark bile acid metabolism and fatty acid metabolism gene sets. In the trajectory leading to endothelial cells, which are derived from mesoderm, we found that a gene module with high expression at intermediate pseudo-time values is enriched for hallmark genes expressed during the epithelial-mesenchymal transition, which is essential for mesoderm formation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Evseenko et al., 2010</xref>). In all three trajectories, gene modules characterized with higher expression at low pseudo-time values show enrichment for gene sets related to the cell cycle; this is expected because pluripotent cells at the lowest pseudo-time values tend to grow and divide faster than more differentiated and more mature cell types, which often exit the cell cycle (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Buttitta and Edgar, 2007</xref>).</p><p>To determine the consistency in dynamic patterns of gene expression between replicates and individuals, we ran split-GPM ten times on cells from the neuron, hepatocyte, and endothelial cell lineages and observed how often each pair of individual-replicate samples clustered together (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7D–F</xref>). In the neuronal and endothelial lineages, all three replicates of 18511 always clustered together and often cluster with replicates of 19160, indicating that these two lines share similar expression dynamics in these trajectories (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7D and F</xref>). Replicates of 18858 often clustered together and rarely clustered with the other individuals, suggesting that not only did 18858 have poor differentiation efficiency, but cells that did differentiate show a distinct pattern of expression dynamics. In the hepatocyte lineage, we observed stronger replicate-specific differences (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7E</xref>). Replicates of individual 19160 still tended to cluster together and to cluster with replicates 1 and 2 of 18511. Replicate 3 of 18511 rarely clustered with the other replicates of that individual, indicating that there were replicate-specific effects on dynamic gene expression.</p></sec></sec><sec id="s3" sec-type="discussion"><title>Discussion</title><p>This work represents a thorough exploration of heterogeneity in single cell data obtained from human EBs towards the goal of establishing this system as a tool to enable studies of variation in human gene regulation across a range of spatially and temporally diverse cell types. We used iPSC-derived EBs because this in vitro model system circumvents the logistical challenges and ethical barriers associated with studies of primary human developmental tissues. This system has key advantages over studies of primary tissues; for example, we are able to control cellular environment in vitro and intentionally design experiments with respect to biological factors including age, sex, and ancestry. Further, we can generate EBs comprised of the same set of diverse cell types from large samples of individuals, enabling high-powered comparisons of cell-type-specific gene expression.</p><p>In subsequent studies, we plan to leverage EBs to identify QTLs and dynamic QTLs across diverse terminal and differentiating cell types. This, of course, raises an ostensibly critical question: to what extent do the cell types derived from EBs faithfully model immature, developing cells in vivo? There is no doubt that the in vitro EB differentiated cells are not a perfect model of primary cell types. The question is whether EB cells are sufficiently representative of primary cell types to be informative. To address this question, we performed several analyses, which suggest that the EB model can be useful. Specifically, we found that EB cells express known cell-type-specific marker genes, including markers of known developmental stages. EB cells also cluster with more than 60 diverse primary cell types from a reference panel of fetal tissues and hESCs, including rare fetal cell types. Lastly, we identified gene modules with dynamic expression patterns that match broad expectations of developmental biology. Together, these results provide evidence that EBs are a suitable model of both terminal and developmental cell types.</p><p>Moreover, EBs may be a useful model for understanding the genetic underpinnings of human traits and diseases regardless of the degree to which they faithfully model human development. EB-derived cells represent a wealth of previously unstudied cell states and dynamic processes. Hypothetically, QTLs identified in these cell types still represent biologically meaningful differences in genetic control of gene regulation, whether they manifest in human development or in adult tissues upon a particular environmental exposure. To provide an anecdotal example of this reasoning, we considered previously collected data from an in vitro differentiation experiment. We took a closer look at the 28 middle-dynamic eQTLs Strober et al. identified during the differentiation of iPSCs to cardiomyocytes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Strober et al., 2019</xref>). Middle-dynamic eQTLs have their strongest genetic effects at intermediate stages of the differentiation time course, and most of them (25/28) were identified exclusively at these intermediate stages of differentiation. Accordingly, these eQTLs are active in early in vitro differentiating cells whose fidelity to primary developing cell types has not been ascertained. These 28 dynamic eQTLs were entirely novel and had not been identified as <italic>cis</italic> eQTLs in any tissue in the GTEx data set. Strober et al. reported that one of these middle-dynamic eQTLs was also found to overlap a GWAS variant associated with body mass index and red blood cell count. This finding highlights that dynamic eQTLs acting in early cell types in in vitro differentiations may affect long-term disease risk in adults.</p><p>To further explore the utility of dynamic eQTLs identified in in vitro differentiations, we used GTEx data to ask whether the middle-dynamic eQTLs are associated with inter-individual variation in trans gene expression or cell composition, either of which could indicate lasting downstream effects in adult tissue from transient dynamic <italic>cis</italic> eQTLs. <italic>Trans</italic> eQTL associations are more tissue-specific than <italic>cis</italic> eQTLs, but <italic>trans</italic> eQTLs are much harder to identify because of their small effect sizes and the requirement to test the association of every locus with every gene. Here, we identified a middle dynamic eQTL SNP (rs6700162) from Strober et al. that, in GTEx data, is associated with fibroblast cell type proportions in HLV (heart left ventricle; p &lt; 0.0009) and with cardiac muscle cell proportions in HLV (p &lt; 0.003). This SNP was also found to have a <italic>trans</italic> eQTL p-value of 1 × 10<sup>–5</sup> in coronary artery. Without the prior knowledge provided by dynamic eQTL data from the in vitro differentiated cardiomyocytes, it would have been impossible to identify these associations using adult primary tissues because the burden of multiple testing within the entire GTEx data set is considered is prohibitively large. This example implies that developing EB cells could be used to understand how transient effects on gene expression are propagated into functional, long-lasting consequences downstream.</p><p>In summary<bold>,</bold> human EBs have the potential to be a powerful system for the identification of dynamic eQTLs. In this pilot study, we performed foundational analyses to better understand how to appropriately conceptualize heterogeneity in this kind of data and how to best design large-scale studies of EBs. We explored cell type composition of EBs in three paradigms; first, with discrete cell types identified with a traditional clustering algorithm, then with more continuous cell “types” identified with topic modeling, and finally exploring dynamic changes in gene expression along trajectories using pseudotime. Cell types defined by discrete clustering are often easier to interpret because they can be contextualized with marker genes and reference data sets defined with bulk sequencing. We conclude, however, that topic modeling is more appropriate for highly heterogeneous single cell data sets like this one. We also explored sources of variation in cell type composition and gene expression. We found that individual variation primarily contributes to patterns in cell type composition based on both discrete clustering and topic modeling. However, variation between replicates is non-negligible, indicating that future studies should focus on inter-individual variation in cell type composition. We also found that technical variation between replicates contributes to variation in gene expression. Future efforts to map regulatory QTLs in EBs should implement study designs with multiple replicates to appropriately correct for batch effects. Overall, this pilot study has laid the groundwork to transform EBs into a powerful model system for the understanding of human gene regulation.</p></sec><sec id="s4" sec-type="materials|methods"><title>Materials and methods</title><table-wrap id="keyresource" position="anchor"><label>Key resources table</label><table frame="hsides" rules="groups"><thead><tr><th align="left" valign="bottom">Reagent type (species) or resource</th><th align="left" valign="bottom">Designation</th><th align="left" valign="bottom">Source or reference</th><th align="left" valign="bottom">Identifiers</th><th align="left" valign="bottom">Additional information</th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td align="left" valign="bottom">Cell line (<italic>Homo-sapiens</italic>)</td><td align="char" char="." valign="bottom">18511</td><td align="left" valign="bottom">PMID:<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/29208628/">29208628</ext-link></td><td align="left" valign="bottom"> </td><td align="left" valign="bottom"> </td></tr><tr><td align="left" valign="bottom">Cell line (<italic>Homo-sapiens</italic>)</td><td align="char" char="." valign="bottom">19160</td><td align="left" valign="bottom">PMID:<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/29208629/">29208629</ext-link></td><td align="left" valign="bottom"> </td><td align="left" valign="bottom"> </td></tr><tr><td align="left" valign="bottom">Cell line (<italic>Homo-sapiens</italic>)</td><td align="char" char="." valign="bottom">18858</td><td align="left" valign="bottom">PMID:<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/29208630/">29208630</ext-link></td><td align="left" valign="bottom"> </td><td align="left" valign="bottom"> </td></tr><tr><td align="left" valign="bottom">Cell line (<italic>Homo-sapiens</italic>)</td><td align="char" char="." valign="bottom">18856</td><td align="left" valign="bottom">PMID:<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/29208631/">29208631</ext-link></td><td align="left" valign="bottom"> </td><td align="left" valign="bottom"> </td></tr><tr><td align="left" valign="bottom">Cell line (<italic>Homo-sapiens</italic>)</td><td align="char" char="." valign="bottom">18912</td><td align="left" valign="bottom">PMID:<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/29208632/">29208632</ext-link></td><td align="left" valign="bottom"> </td><td align="left" valign="bottom"> </td></tr><tr><td align="left" valign="bottom">Cell line (<italic>Homo-sapiens</italic>)</td><td align="char" char="." valign="bottom">19140</td><td align="left" valign="bottom">PMID:<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/29208633/">29208633</ext-link></td><td align="left" valign="bottom"> </td><td align="left" valign="bottom"> </td></tr><tr><td align="left" valign="bottom">Cell line (<italic>Homo-sapiens</italic>)</td><td align="char" char="." valign="bottom">19159</td><td align="left" valign="bottom">PMID:<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/29208634/">29208634</ext-link></td><td align="left" valign="bottom"> </td><td align="left" valign="bottom"> </td></tr><tr><td align="left" valign="bottom">Cell line (<italic>Homo-sapiens</italic>)</td><td align="char" char="." valign="bottom">19210</td><td align="left" valign="bottom">PMID:<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/29208635/">29208635</ext-link></td><td align="left" valign="bottom"> </td><td align="left" valign="bottom"> </td></tr></tbody></table></table-wrap><sec id="s4-1"><title>Samples</title><p>We used iPSC lines from eight unrelated individuals from the Yoruba HapMap population to form EBs.

From replicates 2 and 3 of EB differentiation, EBs were only generated from the same three YRI individuals (18511, 18858, and 19160) and the three chimpanzees (six individuals total). In each replicate, we mixed even numbers of cells of each individual and collected cells in four lanes of a 10x chip, targeting 10,000 cells per lane, and samples were processed using reagents from a single 10x kit.</p><p>Libraries were sequenced using paired-end 100 base pair sequencing on the HiSeq 4000 in the University of Chicago Functional Genomics Core. For libraries from replicate 1, we mixed equal proportions of each of the six EB libraries and sequenced the pooled samples on one lane of the HiSeq 4000. Preliminary analyses showed that two of these lines were low quality. We remade one of the low-quality libraries and discarded the other. We then mixed equal proportions of the remade library with the remaining three libraries from replicate one and sequenced the pooled samples on one lane of the HiSeq 4000. Preliminary analyses indicated that three out of four of these libraries were below optimal quality, but would produce usable data. We then pooled together samples from the final eight libraries from replicate 1, mixing equal parts of each of the five high-quality libraries with half the amount of the other three, and deep-sequenced this pool on eight lanes of the HiSeq 4000. For replicate two libraries, we mixed equal parts of all four libraries and sequenced them on one lane. After confirming that each library was high-quality, we deep-sequenced the same pool on six additional lanes of the HiSeq 4000. For replicate three libraries, we mixed equal parts of all four libraries and sequenced them on one lane. After confirming that each library was high-quality, we deep-sequenced the same pool on four additional lanes of the HiSeq 4000. In all cases, the number of lanes for deep sequencing was calculated to reach 50% saturation.</p></sec><sec id="s4-6"><title>Alignment and sample deconvolution</title><p>We used <italic>STARsolo</italic> to align samples to both the human genome (GRCh38) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Dobin et al., 2013</xref>) and the chimpanzee genome (January 2018; Clint_PTRv2/panTro6). We used gene annotations from ensembl98 and transmapV5, respectively. In order to separate human cells from chimpanzee cells, we identified discordant reads – those that mapped with different scores in each species. We identified a cell as human if (1) at least five discordant reads that had a higher human mapping score and (2) at least 80% of discordant reads had a higher human mapping score. The remainder of analyses in this work were restricted to these human cells.

We differentiated and dissociated iPSCs in parallel using the same protocols described above. After dissociation, we mixed cells from each individual in equal proportions and collected scRNA-seq data using the 10x genomics V3.1 kit, targeting collection of 10,000 cells per lane and 10,000 cells per individual. Notably, we mixed cells from these five lines with cells from two additional lines (each with distinct genotypes) from a separate experiment during 10x collections. Libraries were sequenced using paired-end 100 bp sequencing on the NovaSeq 6000 at the University of Chicago Genomics Core. We aligned samples to the human genome (GRCh38) using <italic>CellRanger</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">Zheng et al., 2017</xref>). We then assigned cells to individuals. We used <italic>demuxlet</italic> to identify doublets with previously collected and imputed genotype data for the five additional YRI individuals; this data originated from the HapMap and 1000 Genomes Projects (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Kang et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Auton et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Belmont et al., 2003</xref>). Finally, we removed cells assigned to individuals that were not a part of this experiment. We filtered out doublets, cells with greater than 15% mitochondrial reads or fewer than 3% mitochondrial reads, and cells with fewer than 1000 unique genes expressed.</p><p>We then normalized data using <italic>SCTransform</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Butler et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Hafemeister and Satija, 2019</xref>), identified clusters using the Louvain algorithm in Seurat (at Resolution 0.15), and visualized expression of canonical marker genes and the most significant marker genes of clusters identified in differential expression analysis (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s4">Figure 1—figure supplement 4</xref>). Based on marker gene expression, clusters 0 and 2 represent early ectoderm, cluster one represents neural crest cells, cluster three represents pluripotent cells, clusters 4 and 6 represent neurons, cluster 5 represents mesoderm, cluster seven represents endoderm, and cluster 8 represents endothelial cells. We calculated the proportion of cells from each individual that were assigned to each of these cell type categories. We observed that each of these five additional cell lines exhibits high differentiation efficiency, comparable to that of iPSC lines 18511 and 19160. Additional lines were also integrated with reference data to annotate cell types as described below.</p></sec><sec id="s4-10"><title>Reference integration and label transfer</title><p>We next compared cells to reference data sets of primary fetal cell types, Day 20 hESC-derived EBs, and hESCs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Cao et al., 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Han et al., 2020</xref>). To integrate our cells with the reference sets, we first subset each reference set to include only protein coding genes. Because the Cao et al. reference set is so large, containing over 4 million cells, we subset cells from this reference set to include a maximum of 500 cells per cell type. We then normalized each reference set using SCTransform (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Butler et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Hafemeister and Satija, 2019</xref>). We then merged the data sets using Seurat, re-ran SCTransform regressing out data set specific effects of sequencing depth, scaled the data, and ran PCA. We then ran Harmony to correct PCA embeddings for the effects of each data set to complete the integration (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Korsunsky et al., 2019</xref>)⁠. We then transferred cell type annotations from cell types present in the fetal reference and hESC to EB cells. For each EB cell, we found the five nearest reference cells in Harmony-corrected PCA space based on Euclidean distance; if at least 3/5 of the nearest reference cells shared an annotation, that annotation was transferred to the EB cell. If fewer than three of the nearest reference cells shared an annotation, the EB cell was annotated as ‘uncertain’.</p><p>To assess the quality of our reference integration strategy, we asked whether (1) datasets are being over-corrected and (2) EB cells annotated using reference cell types express expected marker genes. We first subsetted EB cells to broad cell type categories identified using clustering (at resolution 0.1) and differential expression analysis: Pluripotent (cluster 0), Early Ectoderm (cluster 1), Endoderm (cluster 4), Meso-derm (clusters 2, 6), Neural Crest (cluster 3), and Neurons (cluster 5). Using each subset of cells, we repeated the reference integration pipeline by merging the EB cells with three reference data sets (fetal cells, hESCs, and an external set of Day 20 EBs), normalizing using SCTransform, running PCA using 5,000 variable features, in-tegrating the data using Harmony, and transferring labels based on the five nearest reference cells (see Materials and methods) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Butler et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Hafemeister and Satija, 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Korsunsky et al., 2019</xref>). We found that 79% of EB cells are assigned to the same cell type in the full integration and subset integration. Of EB cells that are anno-tated differently in the full and subset integrations, 82% were labeled as ‘hESC’ or ‘uncertain’ in either the full or subset integration. This suggests that differences in these annotations are often be due to slight changes in the positioning of cells between the hESC reference cells and fetal reference cells; this is expected when pluripotent cells are not included in subsets of EB cells. And, importantly, cells are not often annotated as a different fetal cell type. Together, these results suggest that our integration approach is robust to subsetting input cell types and is likely not over-integrating the test and reference data sets.</p><p>Next, we asked whether annotated EB cells differentially express expected marker genes. We limited this analy-sis to annotations with at least 10 total EB cells from at least two individuals in two replicates. We then calculat-ed pseudobulk expression for cells of the same annotation, individual, and replicate, and filtered genes to in-clude only those with at least 10 counts in at least one sample and at least 15 total counts across all samples. We then TMM-normalized pseudobulk expression values, used voom to calculate a weighted gene expression value, and tested for differential expression between annotations using limma. Of the annotations tested, the most significantly differentially expressed genes often included known cell type markers. For example, cells annotated as cardiomyocytes showed significant upregulation of of MYL7, MYL4, and TNNT2 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s3">Figure 2—figure supplement 3</xref>). Cells annotated as hepatoblasts showed significant upregulation of AFP, FGB, and ACSS2. Cells annotated as mesothelial cells showed significant upregulation of NID2 and collagen genes (COL6A3, COL1A1, COL3A1, COL6A1). These results provide further support that our reference integration approach yields meaningful annotation of EB cells.</p></sec><sec id="s4-11"><title>Topic modeling</title><p>We also performed topic modeling using <italic>FastTopics</italic> to learn major patterns in gene expression within the data set, or topics, and model each cell as a combination of these topics. For this analysis, we used raw counts and filtered the data to include genes expressed in at least 10 cells. We then pre-fit a Poisson non-negative matrix factorization by running 1000 EM updates without extrapolation to identify a good initialization at values of k equal to 6, 10, 15, 25, and 30. We used this initialization to fit a non-negative matrix factorization using 500 updates of the <italic>scd</italic> algorithm with extrapolation to identify 6, 10, 15, 25, and 30 topics. We then used <italic>FastTopics</italic>’ <italic>diff_count_analysis</italic> function to identify genes differentially expressed between topics. We used these differentially expressed genes to interpret the cellular functions and identities captured by each topic. In some cases, differentially expressed genes included known marker genes (<xref ref-type="table" rid="table2">Table 2</xref>).</p></sec><sec id="s4-12"><title>Hierarchical clustering based on cell type composition and gene expression</title><p>To understand how similar cell type composition is between replicates and individuals, we first calculated the proportion of cells from each individual in each replicate assigned to each Seurat cluster at resolution 0.1. Then, using the <italic>ComplexHeatmap</italic> R package and performing hierarchical clustering based on the complete linkage method, we visualized the clustering of these replicate-individual groups (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Gu et al., 2016</xref>). We repeated this analysis using Seurat clusters at resolution 0.5, 0.8, and 1 to show that the overall patterns of hierarchical clustering are robust to cluster resolution. We performed an analogous analysis using topic loadings instead of cluster proportions. Here, we determined the loading of each topic on cells from the same individual and replicate, then used the same hierarchical clustering with <italic>ComplexHeatmap</italic> to visualize patterns of similarity between cells of each individual and replicate (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Gu et al., 2016</xref>).</p><p>We also performed hierarchical clustering on gene expression of individual cells.

We fit a random effect model and modeled cluster, replicate, and individual as random effects. We performed this analysis across all tested Seurat clustering resolutions (0.1, 0.5, 0.8, 1). We performed this analysis using both pseudobulk samples of cells from the same cluster, replicate, and individual and at single-cell resolution with each cell as a sample. We also partitioned the variance in each Seurat cluster separately using a random effect model with terms for replicate and individual. For this analysis, we used pseudobulk samples of cells from each individual and replicate.</p></sec><sec id="s4-14"><title>Power analysis</title><p>To ascertain the power to detect eQTLs and dynamic eQTLs across a range of sample sizes, standardized effect sizes, and experiment sizes we used a power function as derived in <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Sarkar et al., 2019</xref>:<disp-formula id="equ2"><mml:math id="m2"><mml:mrow><mml:mi>P</mml:mi><mml:mi>o</mml:mi><mml:mi>w</mml:mi><mml:mrow><mml:mo>(</mml:mo><mml:mrow><mml:mi>β</mml:mi><mml:mo>,</mml:mo><mml:mi>α</mml:mi><mml:mo>,</mml:mo><mml:mi>n</mml:mi><mml:mo>,</mml:mo><mml:mi>σ</mml:mi></mml:mrow><mml:mo>)</mml:mo></mml:mrow><mml:mo>=</mml:mo><mml:mi mathvariant="normal">Φ</mml:mi><mml:mrow><mml:mo>(</mml:mo><mml:mrow><mml:msup><mml:mi mathvariant="normal">Φ</mml:mi><mml:mrow><mml:mo>−</mml:mo><mml:mn>1</mml:mn></mml:mrow></mml:msup><mml:mfrac><mml:mi>α</mml:mi><mml:mn>2</mml:mn></mml:mfrac><mml:mo>+</mml:mo><mml:mfrac><mml:mi>β</mml:mi><mml:mi>σ</mml:mi></mml:mfrac><mml:msqrt><mml:mi>n</mml:mi></mml:msqrt></mml:mrow><mml:mo>)</mml:mo></mml:mrow></mml:mrow></mml:math></disp-formula></p><p>where β denotes the true additive significance level, ɑ denotes the significance level, n denotes sample size, and σ represents the phenotype standard deviation.

We identified 20 dynamic gene modules in each trajectory and interpreted them using gene set enrichment. To understand the variation in dynamic gene expression between individuals and replicates, we re-ran split-GPM ten times and observed how often cells from each individual and replicate were assigned

Your article has been reviewed by 2 peer reviewers, one of whom is a member of our Board of Reviewing Editors, and the evaluation has been overseen by a Reviewing Editor and Patricia Wittkopp as the Senior Editor. The reviewers have opted to remain anonymous.</p><p>The reviewers have discussed their reviews with one another, and the Reviewing Editor has drafted this to help you prepare a revised submission.</p><p>Essential revisions:</p><p>1) There seems to be a disconnect between what the study should be about and what it is about. Consequently, the message is a bit confusing, and the relevance of the findings is not so clear. The abstract and introduction are both focused on the potential use of EBs for the mapping of genetic variants affecting gene expression. However, the current manuscript is not an eQTL mapping study, but rather a characterization of EBs by single cell RNA-seq. It would be important to write the abstract, Introduction and title in order to make them more relevant to the data presented. For example, a major difficulty for the authors is the identification of different cell types, this should be discussed in the Introduction, rather than the difficulty in mapping genetic variants.</p><p>2) line 104: &quot;we found that every replicate in our experiment, regardless of the individual, includes cells from all three germ layers (Figure 1E, Figure 1G)&quot;.</p><p>Actually, Figure 1G shows that all 18858 samples contain almost exclusively pluripotent cells (cluster 0). More in general, the characterization of the embryoid bodies used for the study is insufficient. The entire study is based on the analyses of embryoid bodies collected after 3 weeks, generated from 3 iPS cell lines. However, 1 line has clear differentiation defects, or that embryoid bodies differentiation experiment was problematic.</p><p>Although this reviewer appreciates that the focus of the study is the generation and analysis of single cell data, if the biological material analysed is of poor quality, the entire study could be questioned. To address this point the authors should perform additional experiments (immunostaining, qPCR) at different days of embryoid body differentiation to make sure that the procedure is correct, that all lines can efficiently differentiate. If they confirm with independent techniques that the 18858 line is almost unable to differentiate, I would suggest to remove it from the analyses, as it simply is a faulty line that cannot be called pluripotent and would not be used by others. For example, the conclusions of lines 324-325 &quot;Replicates of 18858 often cluster together and rarely clustered with the other individuals, suggesting that not only did 18858 have poor differentiation efficiency, but cells that did differentiate show a distinct pattern of expression dynamics&quot; would suggest that such line is problematic and should not be used.</p><p>3) With so few samples multiplexed together, demuxlet may not be able to detect all likely doublets. It may be helpful to run an independent doublet finder on the pass-QC cells to make sure there are no same-sample doublets (that demuxlet would miss).</p><p><italic>Reviewer #1:</italic></p><p>Rhodes and colleagues generated a dataset of single cell RNA-seq of embryoid bodies from 3 iPS cell lines and analysed them with the aim of identifying different cell type and also to partition the variance among biological and technical. The authors propose also to use in the future such system to map genetic variants affecting gene expression, but this interesting aspect is not fully explored in the current manuscript.</p><p>The different strategies used to identify different cell types in the dataset are very interesting and could be used for the study of organoids or other tissues by single cell RNA-seq.</p><p>The data and analyses pipelines could be useful to other colleagues, but some points need to be clarified.</p><p>In line 104: &quot;we found that every replicate in our experiment, regardless of the individual, includes cells from all three germ layers (Figure 1E, Figure 1G)&quot;.</p><p>Actually, Figure 1G shows that all 18858 samples contain almost exclusively pluripotent cells (cluster 0).

The QC performed to get this collection of cells is strong, especially in using the demuxlet approach. From this data, they identify dozens of cell types and infer differentiation trajectories that align well with known developmental gene expression dynamics. They propose this system is therefore an ideal platform for larger eQTL studies.</p><p>Much of the introduction motivates this study by using GWAS and eQTL studies and their corresponding gaps. The idea is to capture unexplored cell states using the EB model and in a later study scale up to enable eQTL scans. Thus, the EB platform should represent convincingly novel cell state space compared to existing data. The pseudotime results seem to indicate this with concordance across reference markers for three different lineages. The power calculations are nice to see, but are an exercise in setting expectations for a future study. Overall, this is a strong paper that represents the initial survey of a potentially exciting eQTL platform.</p><p>[Editors' note: further revisions were suggested prior to acceptance, as described below.]</p><p>Thank you for resubmitting your work entitled &quot;Human embryoid bodies as a novel system for genomic studies of functionally diverse cell types&quot; for further consideration by <italic>eLife</italic>. Your revised article has been evaluated by Patricia Wittkopp (Senior Editor) and a Reviewing Editor.</p><p>The manuscript has been improved but there are some remaining issues that need to be addressed, as outlined below:</p><p>The addition of five more samples to bolster the conclusions observed in the initial three samples is good. However, these additional five samples are not mentioned in the introduction (only the original three are mentioned) and the new results are only presented in supplementary figures. This presents the odd scenario in which the main figures depict less samples (three) than the supplementary figures (five). We therefore recommend combining data from all samples and presenting in main figures, whenever possible. Further, the GEO accession (GSE178274) looks like it only includes the initial three samples. We recommend sharing all data and request that the GEO accession be updated to include the five additional samples (all eight samples total).</p></body></sub-article><sub-article article-type="reply" id="sa2"><front-stub><article-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.71361.sa2</article-id><title-group><article-title>Author response</article-title></title-group></front-stub><body><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Essential revisions:</p><p>1) There seems to be a disconnect between what the study should be about and what it is about. Consequently, the message is a bit confusing, and the relevance of the findings is not so clear. The abstract and introduction are both focused on the potential use of EBs for the mapping of genetic variants affecting gene expression. However, the current manuscript is not an eQTL mapping study, but rather a characterization of EBs by single cell RNA-seq. It would be important to write the abstract, Introduction and title in order to make them more relevant to the data presented. For example, a major difficulty for the authors is the identification of different cell types, this should be discussed in the Introduction, rather than the difficulty in mapping genetic variants.</p></disp-quote><p>We accept this comment. The abstract and introduction have been rewritten to focus on the results of the current experiment, including challenges in classifying cell types. We believe that the title is appropriate for both the results presented and the conclusions drawn from this study.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>2) line 104: &quot;we found that every replicate in our experiment, regardless of the individual, includes cells from all three germ layers (Figure 1E, Figure 1G)&quot;.</p><p>Actually, Figure 1G shows that all 18858 samples contain almost exclusively pluripotent cells (cluster 0). More in general, the characterization of the embryoid bodies used for the study is insufficient. The entire study is based on the analyses of embryoid bodies collected after 3 weeks, generated from 3 iPS cell lines. However, 1 line has clear differentiation defects, or that embryoid bodies differentiation experiment was problematic.</p><p>Although this reviewer appreciates that the focus of the study is the generation and analysis of single cell data, if the biological material analysed is of poor quality, the entire study could be questioned. To address this point the authors should perform additional experiments (immunostaining, qPCR) at different days of embryoid body differentiation to make sure that the procedure is correct, that all lines can efficiently differentiate. If they confirm with independent techniques that the 18858 line is almost unable to differentiate, I would suggest to remove it from the analyses, as it simply is a faulty line that cannot be called pluripotent and would not be used by others. For example, the conclusions of lines 324-325 &quot;Replicates of 18858 often cluster together and rarely clustered with the other individuals, suggesting that not only did 18858 have poor differentiation efficiency, but cells that did differentiate show a distinct pattern of expression dynamics&quot; would suggest that such line is problematic and should not be used.</p></disp-quote><p>Our brief response: To address this, we collected and now present EB single cell data from 5 more individuals to confirm that 18858 is an exception. See below.</p><p>More detailed response:</p><p>The pluripotency of all lines used in this study, including 18858, has been previously validated using several functional assays (Banovich et al., 2018). At the onset of our response to this concern we wish to state that we feel that it would be inappropriate to exclude data from 18858 from this study. The less efficient differentiation of this line provides a real perspective on the utility of our new model, and we do not wish to exclude this line and risk providing a too-optimistic view of the model.</p><p>With that in mind, the statement that “all 18858 samples contain almost exclusively pluripotent cells (cluster 0)” is not correct. Our single cell data set is consistent with the conclusion that 18858 is pluripotent and produces cells of all three germ layers, including mature cell types. It is correct that we observe much lower differentiation efficiency with this line. To visualize the cell type composition of 18858 EBs more clearly, we have added supplement figure S5. Additionally, the number of cells assigned to each cluster (resolution 0.1) from each replicate of each individual is shown in original table S2. While 89% of EB cells from 18858 have remained pluripotent, this individual does produce cells assigned to endoderm (cluster 4, Resolution 0.1), mesoderm (clusters 2 and 6, Resolution 0.1), and ectoderm (clusters 1 and 5, Resolution 0.1). While only a relatively small proportion of EB cells are assigned to these clusters compared to the pluripotent cluster (cluster 0, Resolution 0.1), the cells present in each are high quality and the quantities of cells are sufficient for our analyses of biological and technical variation. More detail about the cell type composition of this line has also been added to the main text (lines 174-183).</p><p>Perhaps the larger point made by the reviewer is that with only 3 individuals, one that did not differentiate as efficiently, we are unable to determine whether poor differentiating EBs will be common or rare. This point, we entirely accept and to address it, we had to collect additional data.</p><p>Specifically, we generated EBs from 5 additional YRI iPSC lines (18856, 18912, 19140, 19159, and 19210). A single replicate of these lines were differentiated in parallel, dissociated in parallel, and then mixed in equal proportions prior to single cell collection using the 10x (see updated Methods section, lines 753-777). Supplemental figure S6 shows quality metrics associated with the data collected from these new EBs. After filtering and normalizing, we clustered the cells and annotated clusters using both canonical markers of each germ layer as well as marker genes learned from differential expression analysis in the original 3 lines. These new lines show the presence of similar cell types to those observed in the original dataset; coarse clustering of these cells reveals clusters representing pluripotent cells, endoderm, mesoderm, early ectoderm, neural crest, neurons, and endothelial cells. All 5 of the newly collected lines have proportions of pluripotent cells under 25%, indicating these lines had differentiation efficiencies that more closely resembled those of 18511 and 19160 in the original data set. Overall, the cell type composition of these new lines suggests that most iPSC lines from the YRI panel will differentiate well using this protocol.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>3) With so few samples multiplexed together, demuxlet may not be able to detect all likely doublets. It may be helpful to run an independent doublet finder on the pass-QC cells to make sure there are no same-sample doublets (that demuxlet would miss).</p></disp-quote><p>Brief response: We accepted the comment and tried an independent doublet finder; it did not do better and we believe we understand the reason for this.</p><p>More detailed response:</p><p>We agree that if we had included only 3 individuals in the 10x collections, the number of samples would be too small to use demuxlet alone for doublet detection. However, as described in the “Single cell sequencing” Methods section (lines 455-463), these 10x collections included samples from additional lines that were not analyzed in this study, but were used for doublet detection with demuxlet. In total, the first batch of collections (including all “replicate 1” samples), included a total of 9 lines from different individuals. Given our loading of 10,000 cells into each 10x lane, we expect a multiplet rate of 7.6%. With 9 individuals, we expect 11.1% of all doublets to be from the same individual. This would suggest that 0.84% of batch 1 cells are doublets missed by demuxlet (141 cells total that passed QC). Batches 2 and 3 of collections (containing “replicate 2” and “replicate 3” samples, respectively), each included a total of 6 lines from different individuals. With 6 individuals, we expect that 16.6% of doublets are from the same individual; this suggests that 1.27% (or 325 cells that passed QC) from batches 2 and 3 are doublets missed by demuxlet. In total, we expect only 466 same-individual cells. Of these, some will represent ‘homotypic’ doublets—cells in a similar transcriptional state. Overall, the proportion of same-individual heterotypic doublets is relatively small.</p><p>We agree, however, that these same-individual heterotypic doublets should be removed if they can be reliably identified by other methods. Most doublet-calling methods able to identify same sample doublets use a similar procedure involving the generation of artificial doublets from cells in the data and comparison of cells to those artificial doublets. We were concerned that in the EB data set, which includes many intermediate, developing cell types, these intermediate cell types may tend to be erroneously called as doublets. We tested the performance of one such method, DoubletFinder (McGinnis et al., 2019), on cells from a single 10x lane. Using Seurat, we first filtered cells using the same criteria as the original data (see Filter and integration Methods), but kept known doublets called by demuxlet, but removed both singlets and doublets not assigned to individuals used in this study. We then normalized data using SCTransform, ran PCA, clustered cells (Resolution 0.8), and ran DoubletFinder. This lane of 10x cells included 2.5% known doublets called by demuxlet (after filtering) and contains a mix of 6 individuals (from a batch 2 collections); we therefore expect 1.27% of cells to be same-sample doublets. We therefore assigned expected doublet rate of 3.8% in DoubletFinder.</p><p>We found that of 64 known doublets called by demuxlet, only 13 were identified as doublets by DoubletFinder. Because DoubletFinder misses over 75% of known doublets in this dataset, it is likely missing true same-sample doublets as well. Moreover, cells called as doublets by doublet finder are concentrated in the area of the UMAP representing early differentiating cells, while the known doublets are distributed more evenly across all cell clusters, as shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="sa2fig1">Author response image 1</xref>. This discrepancy between the transcriptional state of known doublets compared to inferred doublets suggests that DoubletFinder, and other similar methods, cannot reliably call doublets in datasets with continuous cell state gradients. We therefore chose not to remove the DoubletFinder-inferred doublets from our dataset and proceed with the knowledge that a small percentage (less than 1.1%) of cells in our data likely represent same-individual heterotypic doublets.</p><fig id="sa2fig1" position="float"><label>Author response image 1.</label><caption><title>Same-Sample doublet detection test.</title><p>(<bold>A</bold>) Table comparing the demuxlet cell assignments to the DoubletFinder assignments.
