between cellular compartments. Several such sites have been described as well as their tethering machineries. Despite these advances we are still far from a comprehensive understanding of the function and regulation of most contact sites. To systematically characterize contact site proteomes, we established a high-throughput screening approach in <italic>Saccharomyces cerevisiae</italic> based on co-localization imaging. We imaged split fluorescence reporters for six different contact sites, several of which are poorly characterized, on the background of 1165 strains expressing a mCherry-tagged yeast protein that has a cellular punctate distribution (a hallmark of contact sites), under regulation of the strong <italic>TEF2</italic> promoter. By scoring both co-localization events and effects on reporter size and abundance, we discovered over 100 new potential contact site residents and effectors in yeast. Focusing on several of the newly identified residents, we identified three homologs of Vps13 and Atg2 that are residents of multiple contact sites. These proteins share their lipid transport domain, thus expanding this family of lipid transporters. Analysis of another candidate, Ypr097w, which we now call Lec1 (<underline>L</underline>ipid-droplet <underline>E</underline>rgosterol <underline>C</underline>ortex 1), revealed that this previously uncharacterized protein dynamically shifts between lipid droplets and the cell cortex, and plays a role in regulation of ergosterol distribution in the cell. Overall, our analysis expands the universe of contact site residents and effectors and creates a rich database to mine for new functions, tethers, and regulators.</p></abstract><kwd-group

However, to coordinate cellular responses effectively, organelles must communicate and work cooperatively. Membrane contact sites play an essential role in this communication by actively tethering two organelles in proximity to each other, thus enabling a direct physical interaction and the exchange of ions, lipids and other small molecules (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Eisenberg-Bord et al., 2016</xref>).</p><p>Contact sites are formed between most, if not all, cellular membranes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib43">Kakimoto et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib88">Shai et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib106">Valm et al., 2017</xref>) and are implicated in a growing number of processes from organelle morphology and inheritance, to lipid metabolism and intracellular signaling (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib85">Prinz et al., 2020</xref>). To perform these functions, contact sites harbor a defined membrane composition, enriched with specific lipids and proteins, some of which can form tethers between the opposing membranes, enabling a functional interaction (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib87">Scorrano et al., 2019</xref>). While several contact sites have been observed for decades and we know of multiple tethers and functions for the few well-studied contacts, the formation and function of the majority of contact sites remains poorly understood. One important step towards such an understanding would be to obtain the complete proteome of contact sites.</p><p>Several techniques have been developed and adapted to enable the identification of contact site proteins, including proximity labeling assays and systematic high throughput screening approaches (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Cho et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib88">Shai et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib108">van Vliet et al., 2017</xref>). Although these approaches generally require previous knowledge of contact site resident proteins, this can be circumvented by the use of synthetic reporters, such as split proteins, targeted to the opposing membranes of two organelles. When in close proximity, these split proteins will interact, leading to either emission of a fluorescent signal (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Cieri et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Eisenberg-Bord et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib112">Yang et al., 2018</xref>) or an enzymatic reaction (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Cho et al., 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib51">Kwak et al., 2020</xref>).</p><p>We have previously taken advantage of the split fluorescence protein approach to identify unknown contact sites, and to uncover new tethering proteins for the peroxisome-mitochondria (PerMit) contact site (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib88">Shai et al., 2018</xref>), the vacuole-mitochondria contact site (also called vCLAMP for VaCuoLe And Mitochondria Patch; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Bisinski et al., 2022</xref>) and the nucleus-mitochondria contact (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Eisenberg-Bord et al., 2021</xref>), in <italic>Saccharomyces cerevisiae</italic> (from here on termed yeast). Here, we build on this approach and expand it by using high content screens to systematically analyze effectors and resident proteins of six different contact sites: the PerMit, the Lipid Droplet-Endoplasmic Reticulum (LD-ER) contact (LiDER), the nuclear ER-vacuole junction (NVJ), the peroxisome-vacuole contact (PerVale), the Plasma Membrane (PM, or cortex)-LD contact (pCLIP) and the Golgi-peroxisome contact (GoPo), the latter one not previously characterized. All together, we have identified 158 unique proteins with a potential role in tethering and/or regulation of these six contact sites. While focusing on the pCLIP, we identified three proteins – Fmp27 and Ypr117w (recently renamed Hob1 and Hob2 respectively, for <underline>Hob</underline>bit homologs 1 and 2), and Csf1, which share homology with the lipid transfer proteins Vps13 and Atg2, suggesting that other members of this family of proteins are localized to contact sites. Additionally, as we explored the LiDER, we identified a protein of unknown function, Ypr097w. We demonstrated that Ypr097w plays a role in regulating the distribution of ergosterol in yeast cells, and suggest the name Lec1 for <underline>L</underline>ipid-droplet <underline>E</underline>rgosterol <underline>C</underline>ortex 1. Collectively, our studies create a powerful new resource for contact site research in the form of tens of new potential contact site proteins that can now be functionally explored. Moreover, they highlight the power of our high content screening approach for discovering novel functions of uncharacterized proteins and for expanding our understanding of contact site biology as well as better grasping how cells actively distribute cellular lipids.</p></sec><sec id="s2" sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><sec id="s2-1"><title>Mapping the proteome of multiple contact sites using high throughput microscopy screens uncovers potential residents and regulators</title><p>To identify new potential contact site resident proteins and regulators, we used a set of contact site reporters based on a bimolecular fluorescence complementation assay (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Alford et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib94">Sung and Huh, 2007</xref>) that we and others have previously used to visualize contact sites (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Bisinski et al., 2022</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Cieri et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Eisenberg-Bord et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Eisenberg-Bord et al., 2021</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib43">Kakimoto et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib88">Shai et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib99">Tashiro et al., 2020</xref>). In short, each part of a split-Venus protein is used to tag membrane proteins on opposing organelles. Only in instances where these organelles come into extremely close proximity, as is the case at contact sites, the two parts complement each other to form a full fluorophore. Since any membrane protein with the correct topology (terminus facing the cytosol) can be used for this assay (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib88">Shai et al., 2018</xref>), this approach allows for the visualization of contact sites in the absence of known components. Taking advantage of this we used the previously verified reporters for the PerMit, NVJ, LiDER, PerVale, and pCLIP (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib88">Shai et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1A</xref>). Additionally, we created and characterized a new reporter for the GoPo (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1B-D</xref>). This contact site is very dynamic, rare, and metabolically regulated (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1B, D</xref>), potentially due to the quick turnaround of Golgi cisternae. The NVJ reporter served as a positive control, as it is one of the more characterized contacts, therefore in an effective screen we would expect to identify many of its known components. The remaining contacts are considerably less well described and presented a new challenge.</p><p>To identify potential new contact site proteins, we generated strains expressing each of the above-mentioned reporters and crossed them against a collection of 1165 strains each expressing one mCherry-tagged protein under the strong <italic>TEF2</italic> promoter (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1A</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib111">Weill et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib116">Yofe et al., 2016</xref>). The strains were chosen such that each mCherry-tagged protein is either localized to intracellular puncta – the typical cellular distribution of contact site proteins – or has previously been identified as a contact site protein (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="supp1">Supplementary file 1</xref>). These strains were mated against each of the 6 reporter strains using an automated mating, sporulation and haploid selection procedure (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Cohen and Schuldiner, 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib102">Tong and Boone, 2006</xref>) to create six new collections where each haploid strain expresses a split-Venus reporter and one mCherry-tagged protein (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1A</xref>). Each collection was subsequently imaged by high throughput microscopy and the resulting images were manually analyzed for full or partial co-localization between the contact site reporter and the mCherry-tagged protein (residents), and/or effect of the overexpressed protein on the contact site reporter number and/or brightness (effectors). All strains classified as hits were isolated and re-imaged on a higher resolution spinning disk confocal microscope (Micro 1; see Materials and methods). Only those strains that were still clear hits after this step were included in the final hit list (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="supp2">Supplementary file 2</xref>). It is important to note that in the case of small punctate organelles (such as LDs, peroxisomes, and Golgi) the resolution of light microscopy does not enable us to differentiate between co-localization to the contact or distribution over the entire organelle. Hence, to reduce false positives, if a known resident protein of such organelles appeared as co-localizing with the reporter in the screen, we did not label it as a ‘contact resident’ and only considered it a hit in the screen if it was also an ‘effector’. It is important to note that since we did not factor in the number or size of each partner organelle on the background of each strain, any overexpressed mCherry-tagged protein that has an effect on organelle size and distribution, may result in changes to contact site number and/or brightness in an indirect manner.</p><fig-group><fig id="fig1" position="float"><label>Figure 1.</label><caption><title>Systematic screens uncover new contact site residents and effectors in yeast.</title><p>(<bold>A</bold>) Schematic representation of the high-throughput screening approach used to identify new contact site residents and regulators.

Additionally, overexpression of mCherry-Erg2 reduced the frequency and brightness of the reporter signal, suggesting that modulation of the ergosterol biosynthesis pathway affects the formation of the NVJ. This is particularly interesting, since several NVJ resident proteins play a role in sterol sensing and transport, specifically Lam5, Lam6, and Osh1 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Gatta et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib57">Levine and Munro, 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib73">Murley et al., 2015</xref>), and this contact has also been shown to play a role in the mevalonate pathway by facilitating the assembly of HMG-CoA reductases, and consequently affecting activity of these enzymes, during acute glucose restriction (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib86">Rogers et al., 2021</xref>).

In these conditions, Ypr097w localized to internal puncta, several of which co-localize with the LD stain, BODIPY, on the interface with the ER (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3B</xref>), supporting our original observation.</p><p>When using the endogenous promoter to tag Ypr097w with GFP at either the N- or C-terminus (both tags support the function of the protein, see Figure 5A later in the article), Ypr097w showed a different distribution than when overexpressed – it was found primarily at buds and bud necks, with reduced localization to LDs (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s1">Figure 3—figure supplement 1</xref>, B). Because endogenous levels were difficult to detect, we also imaged cells expressing GFP-Ypr097w from the moderate constitutive <italic>ADH1</italic> promoter (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3C</xref>). In this strain, GFP-Ypr097w was more clearly detected and showed a similar distribution pattern to the endogenous promoter, localizing to the bud and bud neck with some increase in the number of internal puncta (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3C</xref>). Additionally, many cells (nearly 60%) were devoid of a punctate signal and appeared to have a general cytosolic localization. This suggests that the overexpression of Ypr097w either alters cellular physiology or saturates binding sites on the bud/bud neck and causes intracellular accumulation. Interestingly, GFP-Ypr097w localization was also affected by the cell cycle, with a bud/bud neck localization more common in cells with large buds (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s1">Figure 3—figure supplement 1C</xref>).</p><p>To further corroborate Ypr097w localization to LDs, we took three complementary approaches. First, we looked at its distribution in cells lacking the LD biogenesis protein seipin by deleting the <italic>FLD1</italic> gene that encodes a subunit of the complex. Seipin mutants form immature LDs that do not detach from the ER. We found that Ypr097w accumulates at LDs in Δ<italic>fld1</italic> mutants (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3D</xref>), corroborating previously published proteomic analysis of these structures (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib110">Wang et al., 2018</xref>). Second, we performed a genome-wide protein fragment complementation screen based on a split dihydrofolate reductase (DHFR) enzyme (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib98">Tarassov et al., 2008</xref> <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="supp3">Supplementary file 3</xref>). This screen, which measures interactions based on colony size after multiple days of growth, showed that the strongest interactors (Z-Score &gt;2.5), which represent proteins in close proximity to Ypr097w, consist primarily of well-characterized LD-localized enzymes (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3E–F</xref>) and include ER membrane proteins that localize to, and help shape, regions of tubular ER, such as Rtn1, Yop1, and Sey1 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">De Craene et al., 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">Hu et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib109">Voeltz et al., 2006</xref>). In contrast, bud neck-localized proteins were not enriched in this screen. This suggests that under the nutrient conditions experienced in a yeast colony (as compared to cells grown in liquid media and during mid-logarithmic growth), Ypr097w is primarily localized to LDs in the proximity of the ER. Finally, we biochemically purified LDs from cells expressing GFP-Ypr097w under control of the moderate constitutive <italic>ADH1</italic> promoter and found that GFP-Ypr097w is indeed present in purified LD fractions (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3G</xref>).</p><p>These distinct distribution patterns suggest that the localization of Ypr097w is dynamically regulated under different environmental conditions. Indeed, we found that when cells were shifted from nutrient-containing media to phosphate-buffered saline (PBS), both endogenous (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s1">Figure 3—figure supplement 1D</xref>) and <italic>ADH1pr</italic>-expressed (not shown), GFP-Ypr097w rapidly (&lt;2 min) re-localized from bud/bud neck to the cytosol, an effect that was blocked if the PBS was supplemented with glucose. Similarly, longer glucose starvation in synthetic media led to a mostly cytosolic localization of this protein (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s1">Figure 3—figure supplement 1E</xref>). This change in localization could be a response to cytosolic acidification due to glucose depletion, and resulting loss of interaction of Ypr097w with pH sensing membrane lipids (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib89">Shin et al., 2020</xref>). In contrast, in stationary cells, GFP-Ypr097w localized mostly in a punctate pattern (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s1">Figure 3—figure supplement 1F</xref>, left panel), which quickly shifted to a mix of punctate and bud/bud neck upon replenishment with fresh media (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s1">Figure 3—figure supplement 1F</xref>, right panel). The movement of Ypr097w between buds and bud necks to internal puncta (many of which co-localize with LDs) under different growth conditions, suggests that Ypr097w acts as a nutrient sensor and may have a role at LDs primarily in lipid storage conditions.</p><p>How is such dynamic localization regulated? We noticed that in the cell lysates (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3G</xref>) Ypr097w migrated as a doublet, suggesting that Ypr097w is post-translationally modified. In fact, several phosphorylation sites have been identified in Ypr097w in high throughput studies (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Beltrao et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib56">Lanz et al., 2021</xref>), including phosphorylation of residue S451 in the region flanking the predicted FFAT motif (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s2">Figure 3—figure supplement 2A</xref>), which has the potential to regulate interaction with VAP proteins (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib48">Kors et al., 2022</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib49">Kumagai et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib68">Mattia et al., 2020</xref>). Moreover, the punctate localization of Ypr097w increased in cells lacking both yeast VAP proteins (<italic>∆scs2/∆scs22</italic>) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s2">Figure 3—figure supplement 2B</xref>). However, we found that expression of either phosphomimetic (S451E; S451D) or phospho-null (S451A) mutants (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s2">Figure 3—figure supplement 2C</xref>), or a mutant lacking the FFAT motif (Y456A, D458A; data not shown), in a strain lacking endogenous Ypr097w, did not show any clear differences in localization relative to the wild type (WT) Ypr097w control. This suggests that neither phosphorylation of S451 nor the presence of the FFAT motif regulates YPR097w targeting under regular growth conditions. Since the Δ<italic>scs2/22</italic> effect on Ypr097w localization appears to be indirect, it could instead be mediated by effects of loss of VAP on other processes such as phospholipid synthesis, sterol traffic and PIP consumption (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib63">Loewen and Levine, 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib93">Stefan et al., 2011</xref>).</p><p>Taken together, these results suggest that the localization of Ypr097w is regulated in response to environmental conditions, and that this protein dynamically partitions between the bud/bud neck and LDs. However, what drives this redistribution is not known and will form the basis of future studies.</p></sec><sec id="s2-4"><title>Alphafold predicted models of Ypr097w demonstrate a large internal hydrophobic cavity</title><p>To understand how Ypr097w is targeted to different cellular locations, we examined its predicted domain architecture. In addition to its PX domain, which harbors the predicted FFAT motif, Ypr097w has an annotated PX-associated domain (PXB) and a domain of unknown function (DUF) 3818 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s2">Figure 3—figure supplement 2A</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib71">Mistry et al., 2021</xref>).

Together with our truncation results, this suggests that full-length Ypr097w functions as a single unit.

AlphaFold2 outputs for Ypr097w and its full-length homologs in both <italic>C. albicans</italic> and <italic>S. pombe</italic> all predict that the different all-helical regions, which appear separate in the one-dimensional map (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4A</xref>), interact in cis to form a sphere ~7 nm in diameter (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4B</xref>). A similar sphere is also predicted for a shorter <italic>S. pombe</italic> paralog that has PXB and DUF3818 without a PX domain (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s1">Figure 4—figure supplement 1A</xref>). A key aspect of these structures is the multiple inter-relationships between the different components of the primary structure. In particular, the N-terminal PXB domain folds intimately together with the unnamed C-terminal region (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4B</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s1">Figure 4—figure supplement 1A</xref>). The PX domain is oriented to expose its PI3P binding site, which would allow Ypr097w to dock onto membranes (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s1">Figure 4—figure supplement 1B</xref>). Among the five AlphaFold2 models, the PX-negative <italic>S. pombe</italic> homolog is the most confidently predicted (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s1">Figure 4—figure supplement 1C</xref>), implying that the PX domain is unnecessary for the overall fold.</p><p>A striking feature of the predicted Ypr097w sphere is that it is hollow with an internal cavity (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4C–D</xref>). The surface of the cavity is mainly hydrophobic (lipophilic) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4C</xref>), a feature that is highly conserved (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4D</xref>). Multiple tunnels potentially provide access from the cytosol (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s1">Figure 4—figure supplement 1D-E</xref>, arrows). Intimate interactions of N- and C-termini, overall spheroidal shape, a large internal hydrophobic-lined cavity, and tunnels linking the exterior to the interior were also predicted by the trRosetta server (data not shown; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib113">Yang et al., 2020</xref>). Among the five proteins modelled by AlphaFold2, <italic>S. cerevisiae</italic> Ypr097w is unique in having three disordered loop inserts in its PX domain (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4A</xref>). Part of the first loop was modelled as dipping into the cavity (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s1">Figure 4—figure supplement 1D</xref>, modelled in white). However, this loop is only found in the budding yeast protein and in that model it is the only part of the cavity predicted with low confidence, at a level AlphaFold identifies as uninformative (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s1">Figure 4—figure supplement 1E</xref>). Therefore, the position of the loop was assumed to be largely external, a position that was supported by trRosetta. We calculated the internal cavity without the loop and found that it has a volume of 29 nm<sup>3</sup> (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s1">Figure 4—figure supplement 1C</xref>), equivalent to a sphere diameter of 3.8 nm. Mutating the hydrophobic residues in the binding pocket altered the capacity of Ypr097w to localize to LDs, as well as its functionality (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s2">Figure 4—figure supplement 2A-D</xref>), suggesting the importance of the hydrophobic pocket for structural stability. While this α-helical structure is unique, the cavity resembles those in the family of large lipid transfer proteins (LTPs) related to vitellogenin, including apolipoprotein B (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib91">Smolenaars et al., 2007</xref>). In these proteins, similar sized cavities lined by β-sheets function in passing lipids from membrane sources to diverse destinations.</p><p>Given the remarkable structure of Ypr097w, and the now readily available structural models predicted by AlphaFold2, we decided to use a candidate approach to look for additional spherical domains with large lipophilic cavities among known contact site proteins in yeast, including our &gt;100 hits. We noted that the contact site protein Mdm1, similarly to Ypr097w, has a PX domain and two associated domains of unknown structure – the PXA and the nexin-C domains – which are found only in Mdm1 and its homologs, including Nvj3 which like Mdm1 also has a PXA domain and nexin-C domain (identified here using HHpred) at its N and C-termini. Strikingly, AlphaFold2 analysis of these proteins revealed that the PXA and nexin-C domains in Mdm1 and Nvj3 fold together to form a large spherical domain with an interior hydrophobic surface (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4E and G</xref>) that is highly conserved (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4F and H</xref>). While the PXA/nexin-C domains share no detectable sequence homology to Ypr097w, the structural similarities suggest that these proteins may share a function that we hypothesize may be in lipid storage or transfer.</p></sec><sec id="s2-5"><title>Ypr097w affects the distribution of ergosterol in cellular membranes</title><p>Since Ypr097w is localized to LDs, we assayed whether it has any effect on this organelle and its ability to store lipids.

To assay this, we tracked the localization of GFP-Ypr097w in cells treated with AmB for 90 minutes and found that indeed, this resulted in a redistribution of Ypr097w (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5B</xref>). Under these conditions, Ypr097w almost exclusively localized to LDs (as marked by Faa4-mCherry). To complement this approach, we tested the effect of fluconazole, a known inhibitor of Erg11 and ergosterol synthesis, on the localization of GFP-Ypr097w (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5s2">Figure 5—figure supplement 2A-B</xref>). To directly track ergosterol distribution in these cells, we constitutively expressed an optimized fragment of the bacterial toxin perfringolysin O, D4H, bound to a mCherry fluorophore. This sensor has been shown to bind free sterols on membranes with a concentration of at least 20 mol% sterols (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib41">Johnson et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib66">Maekawa and Fairn, 2015</xref>) and binds sterols at the PM in both fission and budding yeast (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib46">Kishimoto et al., 2021</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib67">Marek et al., 2020</xref>). As expected, fluconazole treatment strongly reduced the level of cellular ergosterol, as shown by the loss of binding of mCherry-D4H to the plasma membrane (cytosolic signal) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5s2">Figure 5—figure supplement 2A</xref> lower right panels). In these conditions, where internal ergosterol is also depleted, we actually see an increase in the number of cells with bud/ bud neck localization for GFP-Ypr097w (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5s2">Figure 5—figure supplement 2A-B</xref>). The GFP-Ypr097w signal in these cells generally appeared brighter than in untreated cells, suggesting that loss of internal ergosterol potentiates Ypr097w accumulation at the bud / bud neck.</p><p>These results suggest that Ypr097w reacts to changes in ergosterol distribution and in turn, may directly or indirectly affect the distribution of ergosterol in the cell, the levels of free ergosterol, or its capacity to be mobilized.</p><p>To understand if Ypr097w affects ergosterol distribution in cells, we looked at the localization of mCherry-D4H in WT, Δ<italic>ypr097w</italic> and overexpressed <italic>YPR097W</italic> (under control of the <italic>TDH3pr</italic>) cells. In WT cells, this sterol reporter is mostly localized to the PM, with an enhanced signal at the daughter cell (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5C</xref>). Additionally, small punctate structures can also be observed in some cells, generally in proximity to the PM (for examples of phenotypes, see <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5s2">Figure 5—figure supplement 2C</xref>). When <italic>YPR097W</italic> was either deleted or overexpressed, we observed striking effects on the distribution of the mCherry-D4H sterol reporter. In the absence of Ypr097w, a stronger localization to daughter cells was observed, with the additional accumulation of signal at the bud neck, a phenotype that is mostly absent from WT cells in the conditions tested (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5C, D</xref>, (III)). This shift in localization is quite intriguing since Ypr097w itself is localized at the bud and bud neck in many cells. This could suggest that the presence of Ypr097w either shifts the distribution of ergosterol on the membrane, or protects it from interacting with mCherry-D4H. In cells where <italic>YPR097W</italic> is strongly overexpressed under the <italic>TDH3</italic> promoter, the distribution of mCherry-D4H was less polarized, with many cells displaying a similar signal between mother and daughter cells. Additionally, these cells showed a much stronger punctate or mixed pattern than both WT and Δ<italic>ypr097w,</italic> suggesting that overexpression of this protein affects the distribution of accessible ergosterol.</p><p>Our assays cannot differentiate whether the effect of Ypr097w on ergosterol distribution is direct or indirect. It has recently been shown in mammalian cells that the PM distribution of cholesterol can be significantly affected by the levels of phosphatidylserine (PS) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib104">Trinh et al., 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib59">Li et al., 2021</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib101">Thomas et al., 2022</xref>). Indeed, when we actively decrease the levels of PS on the PM by deleting both Osh6 and Osh7 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5s3">Figure 5—figure supplement 3A</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib64">Maeda et al., 2013</xref>) we do see changes in the distribution of both mCherry-D4H and Ypr097w. Hence, to see if the ergosterol changes that we observe in Ypr097w mutants are simply a side effect of changing PS levels, we examined the cellular distribution of PS in cells lacking and overexpressing <italic>YPR097W</italic> (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5s3">Figure 5—figure supplement 3B-C</xref>). Taking advantage of the PS probe GFP-Lact-C2, we showed that deletion or overexpression of <italic>YPR097W</italic> does not affect the distribution of PS at the plasma membrane (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5s3">Figure 5—figure supplement 3B-C</xref>). In addition, cells overexpressing <italic>YPR097W</italic> show no significant differences in the total amount of PS (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5s3">Figure 5—figure supplement 3D</xref>), even compared at the level of PS species (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5s3">Figure 5—figure supplement 3E</xref>), acyl chain saturation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5s3">Figure 5—figure supplement 3F</xref>), or acyl chain length (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5s3">Figure 5—figure supplement 3G</xref>).</p><p>Thus, while Ypr097w does not appear to regulate total ergosterol and sterol ester levels (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5s1">Figure 5—figure supplement 1C-D</xref>), it appears to play a significant role in ergosterol accessibility, membrane bilayer organization, or localization in the cell. While we cannot still rule out that this is indirect, it is clearly not downstream of PS levels. Due to its distribution and effect on ergosterol we recommend the name Lec1 (<underline>L</underline>ipid-droplet <underline>E</underline>rgosterol <underline>C</underline>ortex 1) for Ypr097w.</p></sec></sec><sec id="s3" sec-type="discussion"><title>Discussion</title><p>There has been a growing interest in characterizing membrane contact sites and understanding their functions. This has been fueled by the development of new imaging and biochemical techniques and by the realization that contact site malfunction underlies multiple diseases (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Castro et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Herker et al., 2021</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib87">Scorrano et al., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib119">Zung and Schuldiner, 2020</xref>). However, identifying new contact sites and the proteins involved in their tethering and function still represents an important challenge in the field. Here, by taking advantage of split-Venus contact site reporters and high throughput techniques, we have significantly extended the pool of potential contact site resident proteins and effectors for six different contact sites in yeast. Of note is that our screens were far from being saturating since we only screened ~1/3 of yeast proteins, albeit those with the highest chance of being direct residents and effectors. Even with only a subset of yeast proteins, our screens identified a large number of interesting candidates. Screening the additional proteins in the future may uncover more distal regulators such as enzymes that post-translationally modify contact site proteins or dedicated transcription factors. As a clear example of the effectiveness of this technique, we have detected previously known contact site proteins at the NVJ (Nvj1, Mdm1, Nvj3, and Lam6), at the LiDER (Mdm1), and at the PerMit (Pex34 and Fzo1). We anticipate that the newly reported residents and regulators will help drive further work on well-known contacts as well as enable the characterization of the three least studied contact sites – PerVale, pCLIP, and GoPo.</p><p>We used this screening approach to identify potential roles for poorly characterized or uncharacterized proteins and report t new family of Vps13 related proteins: Hob1 (formerly Fmp27), Hob2 (formerly Ypr117w), and Csf1. Similar to Vps13, these proteins may localize to multiple contact sites. Thus, these newly discovered members of the Vps13/ATG2 superfamily, recently identified by others (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib76">Neuman et al., 2022</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib103">Toulmay et al., 2022</xref>), could potentially play similar roles in lipid transport between membranes. This function appears to be conserved in <italic>Drosophila</italic>, where a single homologue of the Hob1 and Hob2 proteins was initially described to play a role in intracellular trafficking (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib75">Neuman and Bashirullah, 2018</xref>). Furthermore, Csf1 was recently shown to function in lipid homeostasis under cold stress and in cells with rewired glycerophospholipid synthesis pathways (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib40">John Peter et al., 2022</xref>), and has been implicated in the transport of phosphatidylethanolamine from other organelles to the ER (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib103">Toulmay et al., 2022</xref>). It is interesting to speculate that like Vps13, this set of related proteins may similarly function in glycerophospholipid transport at contact sites (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib50">Kumar et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib58">Li et al., 2020</xref>). Additionally, these proteins have homologs in mammalian cells – BLTP2 (for Bridge-like Lipid Transfer Protein family member 2) (also known as KIAA0100/BCOX1) for Hob1/2, and BLTP1 (also known as KIAA1109) for Csf1. Both of these have been implicated in human disease (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Gueneau et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib44">Kane et al., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib61">Liu et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib92">Song et al., 2006</xref>).</p><p>While exploring the LiDER contact, we identified Ypr097w/Lec1, a previously uncharacterized protein. This protein stood out as it has a PX domain for binding lipid headgroups, as well as one of the strongest FFAT motifs in yeast (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib62">Loewen et al., 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib90">Slee and Levine, 2019</xref>). Despite a clear dependence on yeast VAP proteins for its cellular distribution, we were unable to establish a role for the FFAT motif in directing Lec1 localization under the conditions that we tested. However, we determined that Lec1 appears to act as a sensor of nutrient status, changing its cellular localization under multiple metabolic conditions, highlighting the ability of our screen to identify even transient contact site residents.</p><p>A recent <italic>ab initio</italic> predicted structure of Ypr097w (AlphaFold2; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib42">Jumper et al., 2021</xref>) shows Lec1 is composed primarily of alpha helices that fold into a globular structure, with the PX domain on one side. The N- and C-terminal regions of the protein are highly interwoven, which may explain how N- and C-terminal truncations disrupt its localization. Strikingly, the predicted structure of this protein shows a large internal hydrophobic cavity, with multiple channels opening to the cytosol. The hydrophobicity of the residues lining the pocket is highly conserved and functionally important. This tantalizing structure suggests that Lec1 may represent a novel fold that binds or transports lipids.</p><p>There is a precedent for an all-helical protein that forms a lipid binding cavity. Such a cavity has been described for the insect allergen repeat domain, which contains two repeats of a domain of 5 helices, forming two hemispheres with one lipid inside (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib72">Mueller et al., 2013</xref>). The Lec1 cavity is uniquely large for a globular protein, at 29 nm<sup>3</sup> almost 10-fold larger than any known cavity with a predominantly hydrophobic surface (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Chwastyk et al., 2020</xref>). Since Lec1 is associated with membranes, LDs and also with lipid modifying enzymes, we consider it possible that it encloses hydrophobic molecules such as lipids or intermediates of lipid synthesis. The cavity volume is over an order of magnitude bigger than the volume of a single lipid molecule. Hence, we hypothesize that Lec1 could potentially accommodate a mixture of many different neutral lipids (e.g. triolein 1.62 nm<sup>3</sup>) and amphipathic lipids (e.g. DOPC 1.3 nm<sup>3</sup>). Interestingly, we found two additional proteins that share this predicted form (using AlphaFold2) - Mdm1 and Nvj3, which fold together to form large spherical domains with an interior hydrophobic surface (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4E and G</xref>) that is highly conserved (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4F and H</xref>). While the PXA/nexin-C structure is similar to Lec1, they share no detectable sequence homology suggesting that other proteins with such a fold may exist. A more complete survey of predicted structures may reveal yet more proteins with large hydrophobic cavities that may function in lipid binding or transport. While this manuscript was under revision, an additional group characterized the structure of Lec1 based on the AlphaFold2 prediction, and noted its similarities to Mdm1 and Nvj3. The authors arrived at the similar conclusion that Lec1 might play a role as a LTP (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib81">Paul et al., 2022</xref>).</p><p>We found that Δ<italic>lec1</italic> cells are sensitive to AmB, an antifungal drug that interacts with free ergosterol at the PM and is suggested to induce membrane permeabilization and ergosterol removal (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Anderson et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Gray et al., 2012</xref>). Sensitivity to AmB has also been observed for other contact site proteins, such as Lam1 (Ysp1), Lam2 (Ysp2) and Lam3 (Sip3), which localize to ER-PM contact sites and are involved in the retrograde transport of ergosterol from the PM to the ER (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Gatta et al., 2015</xref>). By taking advantage of an ergosterol-binding fluorescent probe, we show that changes in the levels of Lec1 affect the localization of free ergosterol in the cell, affecting its distribution between mother and daughter cells as well as internal reservoirs. The stronger accumulation of accessible ergosterol at the bud and bud neck of cells lacking Lec1 could explain how these mutants are more sensitive to AmB, as higher levels of accessible ergosterol would make budding cells more sensitive to this drug. Together with the lack of changes in overall ergosterol levels in these cells, our results suggest that Lec1 plays a role in the transbilayer organization or mobilization of ergosterol between membranes in yeast. Consistent with this, upon addition of AmB that binds accessible ergosterol, Lec1 shifts from buds and bud necks to LDs where it may either sequester or mobilize sterols. Intriguingly, a complementary approach using fluconazole to decrease the overall cellular levels of ergosterol led to an increase in Lec1 at the bud / bud neck instead of internal structures such as LDs. This is possibly due to the fact that fluconazole also affects internal ergosterol levels and not just free ergosterol on the PM. However, as both of these drugs cause pleotropic effects, these results might also be an indirect response. Further investigation will be necessary to identify the mechanisms that regulate Lec1 localization in cells and to understand how this affects ergosterol distribution.</p><p>More generally our results show that despite the large volume of work on contact sites, multiple contact residents and regulators still await exploration. We anticipate that our work will provide a rich ground for further exploration of the contact site machinery.</p></sec><sec id="s4" sec-type="materials|methods"><title>Materials and methods</title><sec id="s4-1"><title><italic>S. cerevisiae</italic> strains and plasmids</title><p><italic>S. cerevisiae</italic> strains, plasmids and primers used in this study are described in <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="supp5 supp6 supp7">Supplementary files 5-7</xref>.

Plasmids expressing Ypr097w-GFPEnvy truncations were made by homologous recombination in yeast by co-transforming linearized plasmids with generated PCR products. The plasmids were recovered in <italic>Escherichia coli</italic> and sequenced. Plasmid MS1060 expressing GFP-Ypr097w WT was generated by isolation of the gene including 3’ and 5’ UTR by digestion of plasmid MD440 with ApaI and SacI, and cloning to plasmid MS889. Addition of N-terminal yeGFP was performed by restriction free cloning using primers 1060_ GFP_F and 1060_GFP_R, and plasmid MS246. Plasmids expressing Ypr097w phosphomutants were generated by overlap PCR and cloning using XbaI and NsiI restriction enzymes. In short, a fragment from plasmid MS1060 was amplified using the forward primer “YPR_seq2F” and three different reverse primers: 1065_S451E_NsiI_R, 1066_S451D_NsiI_R and 1067_S451A_NsiI_R, one for each mutation, respectively. PCR products and the original plasmid MS1060 were digested using XbaI and NsiI, and ligated to generate the three mutant plasmids. C-terminally GFP-tagged versions of Ypr097w with or without multiple mutations without disturbing the upstream region that includes the gene SYT1 were created by inserting a construct at the endogenous YPR097W locus, using <italic>C. albicans</italic> URA3 as selection marker. An integration construct was constructed replacing the D4H open-reading frame that follows URA3 in pMS1093 by 500 bp 3’ of YPR097W (pTL699).

This subset of the SWAT library contains all strains where protein localization is annotated as “punctate”, as this is the most common phenotype for contact site proteins, as well as a set of known contact site proteins. Protein punctate localization was based on previous annotations manually performed in our laboratory for three different libraries: <italic>NOP1</italic>-GFP, <italic>TEF2</italic>-mCherry and NATIVEpr-GFP, and the equivalent <italic>TEF2</italic>-mCherry strains annotated as punctate in both NOP1-GFP and NATIVEpr-GFP were also added to the final subset. To perform yeast manipulations, query and library strains were handled in high-density format (384–1536 strains per plate) using a RoToR bench-top colony arraying instrument (Singer Instruments, UK). In short, cells were mated on rich medium plates and diploids were selected in SD<sub>MSG</sub>-His containing Geneticin (200  µg/ml) (Formedium) and Nourseothricin (200  µg/ml) (WERNER BioAgents “ClonNAT”). Sporulation was induced by transferring cells to nitrogen starvation media plates for 8 days. Haploid cells were selected in SD-Leu (for Mat alpha selection) and -Arg-Lys with toxic amino-acid derivatives canavanine and thialysine (Sigma-Aldrich) to select against diploids. Finally, haploid cells containing the combination of manipulations desired were selected using SD<sub>MSG</sub>-His containing Geneticin (200  µg/ml) and Nourseothricin (200  µg/ml), and final libraries containing the genomic traits were created. For each library, a set of strains were verified by microscopy and check PCR.</p><p>The new libraries were screened using an automated microscopy setup. Cells were transferred from agar plates into 384-well plates for growth in liquid media using the RoToR arrayer. Liquid cultures were grown in a LiCONiC incubator overnight at 30  °C in SD-His. A JANUS liquid handler (PerkinElmer) connected to the incubator was used to dilute the strains to an OD600 of ~0.2 into plates containing SD-His medium, and plates were incubated at 30  °C for 4  hr. Strains were then transferred by the liquid handler into glass-bottom 384-well microscope plates (Matrical Bioscience) coated with Concanavalin A (Sigma-Aldrich). After 20  min, wells were washed twice with SD-Riboflavin media to remove non-adherent cells and to obtain a cell monolayer. The plates were then transferred to an Olympus automated inverted fluorescent microscope system using a robotic swap arm (Hamilton). Cells were imaged in SD-Riboflavin at 18–20 °C using a×60 air lens (NA 0.9) and with an ORCA-ER charge-coupled device camera (Hamamatsu), using the ScanR software. Images were acquired in two channels: GFP (excitation filter 490/20  nm, emission filter 535/50  nm) and mCherry (excitation filter 572/35  nm, emission filter 632/60  nm). After acquisition, images were manually reviewed using ImageJ.</p><p>A strain was considered a ‘hit’ if the overexpressed protein co-localized with the contact site reporter and/or if it affected the number and/or brightness of the contact site reporter. Co-localization and effect were scored manually. Each strain was given a number based on co-localization: 0, no co-localization; 1, full co-localization – all of the contact site signal co-localizes with the mCherry signal and vice-versa; 2, partial co-localization green – all the contact site signal (green) co-localizes with the mCherry but not all the mCherry signal co-localizes with the contact site; 3, partial co-localization red – all the mCherry signal (red) co-localizes with the contact site but not all the contact site signal co-localizes with the mCherry; and 4, partial co-localization – some of the mCherry and contact site signals co-localize but some do not co-localize. To assess effect, a threshold for brightness was defined using control strains (only expressing the contact site reporter). Images of the control strain were visually compared against all other strains to select those that showed clear changes in the number of puncta per cell and changes in signal brightness. For comparison, 3 microscope fields of the same strain were used and cell density was taken into consideration by looking at the brightfield channel. Each strain was given an effect letter: L, less contact site puncta; M, more contact site puncta; W, weaker contact site puncta; and B, brighter contact site reporter (0 if no effect). Visual effect assessment was based on overall changes in cells per microscopy field and not that of each individual cells.</p><p>Hits form the library were re-picked and re-imaged using a spinning disk confocal microscope (as above, Micro 1) to improve resolution, and only proteins that still fit the co-localization/effect criteria were kept in the final hit list.</p><p>The final list of hits for each contact site was manually annotated. As some organelles are smaller than the diffraction limit of confocal microscopy (peroxisomes, lipid droplets and Golgi), we were unable to distinguish proteins localized to the organelle from those localized to the contact sites analyzed. To simplify the hit list, we assembled a list of known proteins for these organelles, and removed them if they were marked as co-localized in the final hit list unless they affected the contact site extent or brightness.</p></sec><sec id="s4-5"><title>Protein modelling</title><p>Ab initio folding by co-evolution analysis by trRosetta and Alphafold2 was carried out at the Yanglab web server and at the AlphaFold2.ipynb colab respectively (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib70">Mirdita et al., 2021</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib113">Yang et al., 2020</xref>).

MS only was used to monitor LPA, LPE, LPI, LPS, IPC, MIPC, M(IP)2 C as deprotonated anions; Cer and LPC as acetate adducts and ergosterol as protonated ion of an acetylated derivative (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib60">Liebisch et al., 2006</xref>).</p></sec><sec id="s4-15"><title>Data analysis and post-processing (lipidomics)</title><p>Data were analyzed with in-house developed lipid identification software based on LipidXplorer (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">Herzog et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">Herzog et al., 2011</xref>).

Diploids were subjected to two rounds of double mutant selection followed by two rounds of selection on media containing 200 µg/µl methotrexate (MTX). All yeast manipulations were carried out using the BM3-BC microbial pinning robot (S&amp;P Robotics Inc, Canada) with a 384-pin tool. Colonies were maintained in either 768- or 1536-density and technical duplicates were pinned for MTX selection steps. Colony area was analyzed using CellProfiler (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib54">Lamprecht et al., 2007</xref>), after 7 days at 30 °C. Interactions with abundant, cytosolic proteins were filtered out by comparing colony area of Ypr097w DHFR diploids to DHFR diploids containing an overproduced DHFR bait fragment fused to a cytosolic reporter. Z-scores were generated using median colony area from two technical replicate for each Ypr097w-prey combination. Functional analysis of Ypr097w DHFR interactors (Z&gt;2.5) was performed using the Gene Ontology (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Ashburner et al., 2000</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib100">The Gene Ontology Consortium, 2019</xref>) GO Enrichment Analysis tool (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib69">Mi et al., 2019</xref>).</p></sec></sec></body><back><sec sec-type="additional-information" id="s5"><title>Additional information</title><fn-group content-type="competing-interest"><title>Competing interests</title><fn fn-type="COI-statement" id="conf1"><p>No competing interests declared</p></fn><fn fn-type="COI-statement" id="conf2"><p>No competing interests declared</p></fn><fn fn-type="COI-statement" id="conf3"><p>Reviewing editor, eLife</p></fn></fn-group><fn-group content-type="author-contribution"><title>Author contributions</title><fn fn-type="con" id="con1"><p>Conceptualization, Data curation, Formal analysis, Supervision, Validation, Investigation, Visualization, Methodology, Writing – original draft, Writing – review and editing</p></fn><fn fn-type="con" id="con2"><p>Conceptualization, Data curation, Formal analysis, Validation, Investigation, Visualization, Methodology, Writing – review and editing</p></fn><fn fn-type="con" id="con3"><p>Conceptualization, Formal analysis, Validation, Investigation, Visualization, Methodology, Writing – review and editing</p></fn><fn fn-type="con" id="con4"><p>Conceptualization, Formal analysis, Validation, Investigation, Visualization, Writing – review and editing</p></fn><fn fn-type="con" id="con5"><p>Data curation, Formal analysis, Validation, Investigation, Methodology, Writing – review and editing</p></fn><fn fn-type="con" id="con6"><p>Formal analysis, Visualization</p></fn><fn fn-type="con" id="con7"><p>Investigation</p></fn><fn fn-type="con" id="con8"><p>Investigation</p></fn><fn fn-type="con" id="con9"><p>Formal analysis, Validation, Investigation, Writing – review and editing</p></fn><fn fn-type="con" id="con10"><p>Formal analysis, Investigation</p></fn><fn fn-type="con" id="con11"><p>Validation, Investigation</p></fn><fn fn-type="con" id="con12"><p>Validation, Investigation</p></fn><fn fn-type="con" id="con13"><p>Software, Formal analysis</p></fn><fn fn-type="con" id="con14"><p>Investigation, Writing – review and editing</p></fn><fn fn-type="con" id="con15"><p>Data curation, Supervision, Funding acquisition, Writing – review and editing</p></fn><fn fn-type="con" id="con16"><p>Conceptualization, Resources, Supervision, Funding acquisition, Investigation, Visualization, Project administration, Writing – review and editing</p></fn><fn fn-type="con" id="con17"><p>Conceptualization, Funding acquisition, Validation, Investigation, Visualization, Methodology, Writing – original draft, Writing – review and editing</p></fn><fn fn-type="con" id="con18"><p>Conceptualization, Supervision, Funding acquisition, Project administration, Writing – review and editing</p></fn><fn fn-type="con" id="con19"><p>Conceptualization, Supervision, Funding acquisition, Methodology, Project administration, Writing – review and editing</p></fn><fn fn-type="con" id="con20"><p>Conceptualization, Supervision, Funding acquisition, Writing – original draft, Project administration, Writing – review and editing</p></fn></fn-group></sec><sec sec-type="supplementary-material" id="s6"><title>Additional files</title><supplementary-material id="supp1"><label>Supplementary file 1.</label><caption><title>List of strains in the “Puncta Library” collection.</title><p>List of the subset of strains from the SWAT <italic>TEF2pr</italic>-mCherry library selected for this work based on protein localization in cells.</p></caption><media xlink:href="elife-74602-supp1-v1.xlsx" mimetype="application" mime-subtype="xlsx"/></supplementary-material><supplementary-material id="supp2"><label>Supplementary file 2.</label><caption><title>Newly suggested contact site residents and regulators.</title><p>List of hits for each of the 6 screens performed and their phenotype based on co-localization with contact site reporter and/ effect over the contact site reporter.</p></caption><media xlink:href="elife-74602-supp2-v1.xlsx" mimetype="application" mime-subtype="xlsx"/></supplementary-material><supplementary-material id="supp3"><label>Supplementary file 3.</label><caption><title>Ypr097w DHFR Proximity Interactome.</title><p>List of noise-filtered Ypr097w DHFR interactors (Z-Score &gt;2.5).

Your article has been reviewed by 3 peer reviewers, one of whom is a member of our Board of Reviewing Editiors, and the evaluation has been overseen by a Reviewing Editor and Vivek Malhotra as the Senior Editor. The reviewers have opted to remain anonymous.</p><p>The reviewers have discussed their reviews with one another, and the Reviewing Editor has drafted this to help you prepare a revised submission.</p><p>Essential revisions:</p><p>1) Better characterisation of the pCLIP and GoPo reporters and the respective contact sites.</p><p>2) The identification of Ypr097W/Lec1 as a putative lipid binding protein and its effects in ergosterol distribution are very interesting. However, the claim that Lec1 is part of a new family of lipid binding proteins requires further support, such as demonstration of its lipid binding activity and/or use of mutagenesis to show a role of the hydrophobic pocket.</p><p>3) The localization of Hob1, Hob2 and Csf1 to ER-PM MCS should be further characterized. In particular, it should include the analysis of C-terminally tagged endogenous proteins together with organelle markers.</p><p><italic>Reviewer #1 (Recommendations for the authors):</italic></p><p>1) Validation of the MCS reporters is not shown. This is particularly important for pCLIP and GoPo, which have not been reported before. Fluorescence complementation between two proteins that normally localize to different organelles is far from demonstrating the existence of a MCS between those organelles. It would be important to demonstrate using marker proteins and ideally electron microscopy/CLEM the existence of the mentioned MCS and the suitability of the fluorescent reporter.</p><p>2) As pointed out above, the identification of a phenotype in ergosterol distribution for Ypr097W/Lec1 is very interesting. However, it is unclear how this observation relates with the localization of Lec1 to LDs, which is observed only upon over-expression. Instead, further characterization of Ypr097w phenotype (via mutagenesis, modulation of ergosterol biosynthetic pathway, test ability to bind ergosterol, etc) in ergosterol distribution would be a plus.</p><p>3) The description of phenotypes is mostly qualitative. For example, when describing effectors, it is unclear how: 1) full vs partial localization was scored; 2) the brightness of the punctae. Was is there a threshold for these effectors? all punctae became brighter, how much brighter? or only a fraction? some details on the criteria would be useful. Also, Ypr097w was described to localize &quot;primarily at buds and necks….&quot;. Simple analysis of the images appears to suggest that the localization to buds and bud necks depend on the bud size. Along the same line is stated that &quot;some increase in the number of internal puncta&quot;. Again, it would be good to provide a quantitative description of the phenotypes described throughout the manuscript.</p><p>4) In some MCS there is the enrichment of a protein from a third organelle (for example Nvj1 is enriched at Po-Mito or Vac8 at LD-PM). Is this because a third organelle is part of the MCS or is it a false positive? Please comment. In addition, several proteins appear to be present in most MCS. This behaviour has been described for soluble MCS proteins such as Vps13. However, is this also expected for membrane proteins like Mdm1 and Tul1?</p><p>5) Both pCLIP and Lider involve LDs. Since the imaging of these organelles is diffraction limited, is it expected that overexpression of any protein that impacts in LD size would, in principle, result in changes in the size/brightness of the Lider and pCLIP reporters?</p><p><italic>Reviewer #2 (Recommendations for the authors):</italic></p><p>1. The identification of Ypr097w/Lec1 is extremely interesting. However, more can be done on this protein. The large cavity of Lec1 is unique, and is suggested to host tiny LDs/TAG and PC mixtures. It would be important to test this. For instance, does Lec1 bind TAG or sterol esters or PC? See PMID 31708432 for relevant assays. If so, some sort of lipid transfer assay in vitro would significantly strengthen this work.</p><p>2. The D4H phenotype does not necessarily indicate the Lec1's primary function is in sterol trafficking/metabolism. Latest work has shown that phosphatidylserine can greatly impact D4H/sterol distribution. See PMID 33929485 and 32690708. It would be good to also examine the cellular distribution of PS.</p><p>3. Figure 3C is confusing. Can the authors do similar experiment as 3F but with endogenous promoter and under the same condition as 3C?</p><p>4. Not clear to this reviewer how specific Osw5/Ldo16 is to the LDs. Few proteins are exclusively localized to LDs. Not sure if there is such a protein at all in yeast. Perhaps some past validation work can be made clearer.</p><p><italic>Reviewer #3 (Recommendations for the authors):</italic></p><p>1. In Figure 1 the authors use a set of split venus probes to detect specific MCSs primarily utilizing constructs characterized in their previous publication (Shai et. al, Nature Communications, 2018). They also introduce a new probe for detection of Golgi-Peroxisome membrane contact sites (GoPo). Proper localization of the GoPo probe needs to be demonstrated to validate this data.</p><p>2. In Figure 2 the authors identify 3 proteins (Fmp27, Ypr117w, and Csf1) that colocalize with the pCLIP. The authors note that these proteins have previously been shown to localize to ER-PM sites when tagged at their C-terminus. They propose that by tagging these proteins at the N-terminus they have disrupted their endogenous localization to the ER membrane (all 3 have shown or predicted N-terminal ER transmembrane anchors) which has in part led to pCLIP colocalization. The disruption of proper ER localization by these proteins weakens their conclusions that these proteins function at the pCLIP.</p><p>For example, an alternative explanation is that N-terminal tagging leads to misfolding of the protein and therefore localization to the LD, as the LD has recently been shown to store misfolded proteins. These proteins may maintain their endogenous affinity for the plasma membrane and thereby localize to the pCLIP.</p><p>The authors note that C-terminal tagging of these proteins maintains targeting to the ER and PM as they are found predominantly at ER-PM contact sites. If these proteins truly function at the pCLIP, one would expect that overexpression of C-terminally tagged constructs would show pCLIP colocalization in addition to ER-PM colocalization. The authors should test the localization of at least one C-terminally tagged pCLIP protein and quantify localization to pCLIP vs. ER-PM contacts. Without this data, the conclusion than Fmp27, Ypr117w, and Scf1 are pCLIP proteins is not well supported.</p><p>3. Through in silico approaches the authors demonstrate that Lec1 appears to form a large hydrophobic cavity structure similar to predictions of Mdm1 and Nvj3. They propose that these proteins are a new family of lipid binding proteins. However, as the authors did not directly assess the ability of Lec1 to bind lipids they have only shown this is a putative lipid binding protein and the tittle of this section needs to be adjusted accordingly.</p><p>Suggestion for future studies:</p><p>Due to the small size of organelles involved in the assessed MCSs (lipid droplets, Golgi, and peroxisomes) the authors exclude hits that only demonstrated colocalization and are known resident proteins of these small organelles. While this greatly reduces the potential for false positive hits, it also likely leads to false negatives. A secondary screen focused on this subset of proteins to identify those which may serve as tethers would provide valuable insight in a future study.</p></body></sub-article><sub-article article-type="reply" id="sa2"><front-stub><article-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.74602.sa2</article-id><title-group><article-title>Author response</article-title></title-group></front-stub><body><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Essential revisions:</p><p>1) Better characterisation of the pCLIP and GoPo reporters and the respective contact sites.</p></disp-quote><p>We have added the characterization of both contact sites as requested.</p><p>For the pCLIP – Since this reporter has previously been reported (Shai et al., 2018 Nat Commun 9, 1761. doi:10.1038/s41467-018-03957-8) we have only added one new figure (Figure 2 S1A) which shows the co-localization of the contact site reporter with a lipid droplet marker (MDH) and a cell periphery marker (TRITC-ConA).</p><p>For the GoPO – Since this reporter is presented for the first time, we have rigorously characterized the GoPo reporter by looking at the frequency of co-localization between peroxisomes and the Golgi in cells (Figure 1 S1B), the co-localization of the contact site reporter with a peroxisome marker (CFP-SKL) and a Golgi marker (Sec7-mCherry) (Figure 1 S1C), and by identifying a condition where this contact site is increased (Figure 1 S1D).</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>2) The identification of Ypr097W/Lec1 as a putative lipid binding protein and its effects in ergosterol distribution are very interesting. However, the claim that Lec1 is part of a new family of lipid binding proteins requires further support, such as demonstration of its lipid binding activity and/or use of mutagenesis to show a role of the hydrophobic pocket.</p></disp-quote><p>We have attempted to address this issue extensively by creating many strains with multiple mutations at the proposed lipid binding cavity surface of Lec1, and subsequently analyzing protein activity (detailed experimental design, results and conclusions in point-by-point response to reviewers below). Despite the enormous time and resource investment in creation of a huge array of mutants and careful investigation of phenotypes, we were unable to determine unequivocally a clear role for the hydrophobic pocket since all mutations also affected protein stability and/or localization.</p><p>However, we would like to point out that a recent publication by Paul and colleagues (Paul et al., 2022 Front. Cell Dev. Biol. 116. doi:10.3389/fcell.2022.826688) analyzed the structure of Lec1 and additional PX-domain containing proteins using a similar approach to ours. Taking into consideration the known functions of the PX-domain containing proteins and the large hydrophobic cavity identified in these proteins, the authors reached the same conclusion as us, suggesting that these represent a new family of lipid binding/transporting proteins. In addition, although the Paul et al., study includes crystallography data of other domains that do not participate in the proposed cavity, the authors were unable to purify full SNX proteins to be able to perform biochemical assays, and we expect similar difficulties would be the case for Lec1. For this reason, we have toned down our wording to state very carefully that this is only a hypothesis and that clearly future biochemical proof will be required.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>3) The localization of Hob1, Hob2 and Csf1 to ER-PM MCS should be further characterized. In particular, it should include the analysis of C-terminally tagged endogenous proteins together with organelle markers.</p></disp-quote><p>During the lengthy revision process of our manuscript, C-terminally tagged Hob1, Hob2 and Csf1 have already been shown to localize to ER-Plasma membrane and ER-Mitochondria contact sites (Neuman et al., 2022 J. Cell Sci. 135(5):jcs259086. doi:10.1242/jcs.259086; Toulmay et al., 2022 J. Cell Biol. 221 (3): e202111095. doi:10.1083/jcb.202111095). However, it should be noted that both Hob2 and Csf1 are expressed at very low levels endogenously and therefore had to be tagged with multiple GFP molecules for detection at these contact sites (Toulmay et al., 2022 J. Cell Biol. 221 (3): e202111095. doi:10.1083/jcb.202111095). We now discuss these manuscripts in ours and did not feel we should redo these published experiments</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Reviewer #1 (Recommendations for the authors):</p><p>1) Validation of the MCS reporters is not shown. This is particularly important for pCLIP and GoPo, which have not been reported before. Fluorescence complementation between two proteins that normally localize to different organelles is far from demonstrating the existence of a MCS between those organelles. It would be important to demonstrate using marker proteins and ideally electron microscopy/CLEM the existence of the mentioned MCS and the suitability of the fluorescent reporter.</p></disp-quote><p>We thank the reviewer for pointing this out and have now added supplementary characterization of the pCLIP and GoPo contact sites. The pCLIP has been previously described by us (Shai et al. 2018 Nat Commun 9, 1761. doi:10.1038/s41467-018-03957-8) and so we have only added one new figure (Figure 2 S1A) which shows the co-localization of the contact site reporter with a LD marker (MDH) and a cell periphery marker (TRITC-ConA). For the GoPo, since this is the first demonstration of a reporter for this contact site, we have rigorously characterized it by looking at the frequency of co-localization between peroxisomes and the Golgi in the absence of the reporter (Figure 1 S1B), the co-localization of the contact site reporter with a peroxisome marker (CFP-SKL) and a Golgi marker (Sec7-mCherry) (Figure 1 S1C), and by identifying a condition where this contact site is increased (Figure 1 S1D).</p><p>Since all supported their function as bone-fide reporters and since performing electron microscopy experiments on these reporters was not possible for us at this time and has not been the standard in the field for other reporters, we hope that this is satisfactory.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>2) As pointed out above, the identification of a phenotype in ergosterol distribution for Ypr097W/Lec1 is very interesting. However, it is unclear how this observation relates with the localization of Lec1 to LDs, which is observed only upon over-expression.</p></disp-quote><p>We would like to clarify that at endogenous levels Lec1 also localizes to LDs. However, this localization is less pronounced. To clarify this in the text and show this experimentally we have now added an example of the endogenous GFP-tagged protein with the LD marker Faa4-mCherry (Figure 3 S1B), and added a section in the text.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Instead, further characterization of Ypr097w phenotype (via mutagenesis, modulation of ergosterol biosynthetic pathway, test ability to bind ergosterol, etc) in ergosterol distribution would be a plus.</p></disp-quote><p>To further characterize the Lec1 phenotype, we looked at changes in ADHpr-GFP-Lec1 localization in cells treated with 40 µg/ml of fluconazole for 3h (Figure 5 S2B-C). Fluconazole is a known inhibitor of Erg11 and treatment with this drug strongly reduces the overall levels of cellular ergosterol, which can be clearly observed by the loss of binding of mCherry-D4H to the plasma membrane (cytosolic signal) (Figure 5 S2B lower right panels). After 3h of treatment with fluconazole, there is a small increase in the number of cells with bud/ bud neck localization for GFP-Lec1. The GFP-Lec1 signal in these cells generally appears brighter than in untreated cells, suggesting that loss of ergosterol potentiates Lec1 accumulation at the bud / bud neck. This result suggests that Lec1 cellular localization is affected by the levels of ergosterol. However, since treatment with high concentration of fluconazole leads to growth arrest (Zhang et al. 2010. PLOS Pathogens 6:e1000939. doi:10.1371/journal.ppat.1000939), it is also possible that this signal increase is the result of Lec1 accumulation at the bud due to a stalling in budding. We now discuss this in the text.</p><p>We have also extensively mutagenized Lec1 as requested in an attempt to find a mutant that is still localized to LDs and stable yet not causing sterol redistribution. However, despite great efforts this has proven to be challenging (See below in detailed response to this request from reviewer #2).</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>3) The description of phenotypes is mostly qualitative. For example, when describing effectors, it is unclear how: 1) full vs partial localization was scored; 2) the brightness of the punctae. Was is there a threshold for these effectors? all punctae became brighter, how much brighter? or only a fraction? some details on the criteria would be useful.</p></disp-quote><p>We agree with the reviewer and added information regarding these criteria to the Materials and methods section, subsection “High content contact site protein screens”.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Also, Ypr097w was described to localize &quot;primarily at buds and necks….&quot;. Simple analysis of the images appears to suggest that the localization to buds and bud necks depend on the bud size. Along the same line is stated that &quot;some increase in the number of internal puncta&quot;. Again, it would be good to provide a quantitative description of the phenotypes described throughout the manuscript.</p></disp-quote><p>We agree with the reviewer and have added detailed localization data taking into consideration the bud size (Figure 3 S1C).</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>4) In some MCS there is the enrichment of a protein from a third organelle (for example Nvj1 is enriched at Po-Mito or Vac8 at LD-PM). Is this because a third organelle is part of the MCS or is it a false positive? Please comment.</p></disp-quote><p>This is a pertinent question and indeed, we believe that there is the possibility of 3-way contact sites, and these could potentially be detected when observing the contact between 2 of the 3 organelles due to the diffraction limit of optical microscopy.</p><p>To further explore the possibility of 3-way contacts, we first looked at reporters where some hits from an unexpected organelle showed up. To this end, we examined strains expressing either the LiDER, the PerVale or the GoPo, in combination with a vacuole marker (FM4-64) or a mitochondrial marker (MitoTracker). Indeed, we found that the LiDER reporter can localize in the proximity of both the vacuole and mitochondria but only in rare cases. Similarly, the other contacts also show very low to no co-localization with the markers, suggesting that our approach is likely best suited to detect 2-way contacts.</p><p>We also looked at the LD-PM contact site reporter with a vacuole marker (FM4-64) as the reviewer requested although Vac8, in our screen, does not co-localize with the contact site reporter, but instead increases the brightness and number of contacts detected in these cells (which can be indirect and does not necessarily suggest a three-way contact). Likewise, in our screen Nvj1 is not enriched at the PO-MITO contact site, but instead decreases the number and brightness of detected contacts in these cells. Indeed, as expected in this strain, the vacuole was not found in proximity to the LD-PM contact site.</p><p>At this stage, we have not added these experiments, which only have negative data, to the manuscript and would like to leave it at the discretion of the editor whether to do so.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>In addition, several proteins appear to be present in most MCS. This behaviour has been described for soluble MCS proteins such as Vps13. However, is this also expected for membrane proteins like Mdm1 and Tul1?</p></disp-quote><p>Some membrane proteins such as the LAM/LTC family of proteins have been shown to be able to localize to multiple contact sites despite having a transmembrane domain hence we think that this is indeed possible. In our data, Mdm1 has been previously shown to localize to LiDER and NVJ contact sites; additionally we shown that it co-localizes with the pCLIP contact site reporter, which is in agreement with its <italic>Drosophila</italic> counterpart (Snazarus) which localizes at ER-LD-PM contacts; additionally, it affects the PerMit reporter but is not localized to it. Tul1 affects/co-localizes with most contacts which may be interesting to follow up on. However, due to the high throughput nature of these experiments, we are unable to follow up on every single protein. We have gone in depth into the Vps13 family of proteins which also localize to multiple contact sites.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>5) Both pCLIP and Lider involve LDs. Since the imaging of these organelles is diffraction limited, is it expected that overexpression of any protein that impacts in LD size would, in principle, result in changes in the size/brightness of the Lider and pCLIP reporters?</p></disp-quote><p>We agree with the reviewer about this important technical point and its potential impact on our dataset. Hence, we have re-analyzed a subset of the hits for both the pCLIP and LiDER (<xref ref-type="table" rid="sa2table1">Author response table 1</xref>). We found that in some cases there was as increase in the number/size of LDs as a result of protein overexpression/tagging, but that this was not always the case (approximately true for only 50% of hits analyzed). Protein overexpression and tagging is inherently linked to changes in cellular dynamics and this is something we keep in mind when working with high throughput datasets. However, we are unable to account for all variables when dealing with large datasets, and have therefore not analyzed organelle number and size when determining if a protein constituted a hit in each screen. We have now clearly stated this in the text so that people are aware of this caveat.</p><table-wrap id="sa2table1" position="float"><label>Author response table 1.</label><table frame="hsides"

authors):</p><p>1. The identification of Ypr097w/Lec1 is extremely interesting. However, more can be done on this protein. The large cavity of Lec1 is unique, and is suggested to host tiny LDs/TAG and PC mixtures. It would be important to test this. For instance, does Lec1 bind TAG or sterol esters or PC? See PMID 31708432 for relevant assays. If so, some sort of lipid transfer assay in vitro would significantly strengthen this work.</p></disp-quote><p>Although this would be an exciting avenue to follow, we believe that purifying the active protein (for use either to extract co-purified lipid or in a lipid transfer assay), would prove challenging for this specific protein due to its size and biophysical characteristics and especially under the time constrains of revision and with the reduced capacity to work that we have experienced in the last year due to COVID and the maternity leave of our first author. Indeed, a recent attempt to purify SNX proteins (Paul et al., 2022 Front. Cell Dev. Biol. 116. doi:10.3389/fcell.2022.826688) was unsuccessful and we expect similar difficulties would be the case for Lec1.</p><p>In addition, it is often the case in such systematic manuscripts that bring forward a wealth of hypotheses that it is not possible to go into as much mechanistic depth as a manuscript solely dedicated to the study of a single protein.</p><p>However, we have made a real attempt to bring forward support to the fact that Lec1 is a lipid transfer protein by mutating the proposed lipid binding cavity surface of Lec1, to see if we could inactivate it.</p><p>The predicted Lec1 cavity is lined by &gt;100 residues, almost all of which are hydrophobic, so we decided to focus on the conserved hydrophobic residues in particular with bulky side-chains (FWY), and mutate large groups of these either to alanine or serine.</p><p>We C-terminally tagged the genomic copy of Lec1 (under its own promoter), either keeping the wild-type sequence, or at the same time mutating either 19 residues in the N-terminal half (see <xref ref-type="fig" rid="sa2fig1">Author response image 1</xref> – Panel Ai) or 26 residues in the C-terminal half (Panel Aii and iii). Mutations were either all to alanine or all to serine. Levels of Lec1-GFP in cells determined by Western Blot showed modest reduction in 19A/S and 26A/S variants compared to Lec1WT-GFP (Panel B), whereas combined mutation of residues in both the N- and C-terminal halves of Lec1-GFP (45A/S) resulted in more severe stability defects (Panel B). By fluorescence, overall signal of Lec1-GFP corresponded generally to levels detected by blotting. In addition, while Lec1WT-GFP localized to lipid droplets under the conditions used (Panel Ci), neither 19S nor 26A showed any targeting under any condition (Panels Cii and iii) (also true for other variants, data not shown).</p><p>Notwithstanding the reduction in protein level by approx. 20-50% and the lack of proper localization, we tested function in terms of ability to rescue sensitivity to Amphotericin B (AmB). A sample experiment studying 26A, a relatively stable variant, shows that Lec1WT-GFP (Panel D, rows 2/3) was almost as active as the native untagged allele (row 1), indicating that the single genomic GFP-tagged copy was active. In contrast, 26A-GFP (rows 4-6) was inactive since the minimal growth in the presence of AmB shown by cells at the highest concentration of AmB was similar to the null allele (rows 7/8). The same lack of activity was seen for all other variants tested, including 19S-GFP, and also for all mutants without the GFP tag (data not shown).</p><p>Although this lack of activity might have arisen from reduced levels or inability to properly localize, we found that when the level of Lec1WT-GFP was reduced to 50% (achieved by creating a Lec1-GFP/null diploid strain and checked against Pgk1 levels), (see Panel B, lane 7) there was still strong rescue above strains carrying null or mutant alleles (data not shown). Therefore, the evidence in total suggests that multiple mutations of the hydrophobic cavity prevents Lec1 function.</p><p>The possibility that loss of function leads to the loss of targeting would fit the predicted structure and the designation of Lec1 as a Lipid Transfer Protein (LTP). However, we cannot exclude the converse possibility that the loss of targeting leads to the loss of function. In this case, the mutants would not be informative about whether Lec1 has the predicted structure and hypothesized LTP function. This data has now been added to the manuscript alongside a careful explanation of what can, and cannot, be deduced from it.</p><fig id="sa2fig1" position="float"><label>Author response image 1.</label><caption><title>Mutagenesis analysis of Ypr097w hydrophobic cavity.</title><p>(<bold>A</bold>) Internal surface of cavity in Ypr097w (Alphafold prediction), either looking away from the largest opening (Ai/ii) or at it (Aiii).

It would be good to also examine the cellular distribution of PS.</p></disp-quote><p>We agree with the reviewer and have performed several experiments to access changes in phosphatidylserine distribution and levels in cells lacking and overexpressing Lec1 (Figure 5 S3). Taking advantage of the PS probe GFP-Lact-C2, we show that deletion or overexpression of Lec1 do not affect the distribution of PS at the plasma membrane (Figure 5 S3B-C). These strains also show no significant differences in the total amount of PS (Figure 5 S3D-G), even compared at the level of PS species (Figure 5 S3E), acyl chain saturation (Figure 5 S3F), and acyl chain length (Figure 5 S3G). To complement this approach, we also created a new strain expressing ADH1pr-GFP-Lec1 and mCherry-D4H, and deleted both Osh6 and Osh7 (Figure 5 S3A). Deletion of these two proteins is known to decrease the levels of cellular PS and to inhibit transport of PS from the ER to the plasma membrane (Maeda et al., 2013 Nature 501, 257–261. doi:10.1038/nature12430).</p><p>Interestingly, these strains show changes in the distribution of both mCherry-D4H and Lec1. In several cells, the mCherry-D4H signal is much weaker, particularly in the mother cell if budding, pointing to a change in ergosterol availability at the PM. Strikingly, in several cells Lec1 is not only localized to the bud/bud neck and internal puncta, but also to the whole PM. This could be due to changes in the availability of either ergosterol or PS at the PM, or due to changes in other membrane lipids in response to the disruption of PS transport. We think these data add a lot to the manuscript and thank the reviewer for prompting us to test this angle.</p><p>Regardless we now discuss in our manuscript the fact that the changes that we observe can also be caused by indirect effect of Lec1 function either in lipid transfer of non-sterols or in another function.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>3. Figure 3C is confusing. Can the authors do similar experiment as 3F but with endogenous promoter and under the same condition as 3C?</p></disp-quote><p>We have tried to purify Lec1 at endogenous levels using two strains: one expressing GFP-Lec1 under the endogenous promoter and a second one expressing Lec1-TAP tag. However, with both strains the levels of the protein were either too low to detect or their detection was inconsistent (data not shown). We also performed these experiments under different growth conditions (stationary and growth resumption) but with inconsistent results. Since this data comes in addition to many other pieces of supportive data of Lec1 localization, we hope that this is acceptable.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>4. Not clear to this reviewer how specific Osw5/Ldo16 is to the LDs. Few proteins are exclusively localized to LDs. Not sure if there is such a protein at all in yeast. Perhaps some past validation work can be made clearer.</p></disp-quote><p>We have previously used Osw5/Ldo16 to successfully detect several LD contact sites (Shai et al., 2018 Nat Commun 9, 1761. doi:10.1038/s41467-018-03957-8). In this study, we also created a strain expressing Osw5-VC and a cytosolic VN fragment, to test the accessibility of the VC fragment. In this strain, the Venus signal is present exclusively at LDs (Shai et al., 2018 Nat Commun 9, 1761, Figure S2). Importantly, under our tested conditions we never see an ER form of the protein although we cannot exclude that some small amount is present there. To this end, we are certain that the vast majority of our signal is regarding the Lipid Droplet local.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Reviewer #3 (Recommendations for the authors):</p><p>1. In Figure 1 the authors use a set of split venus probes to detect specific MCSs primarily utilizing constructs characterized in their previous publication (Shai et. al, Nature Communications, 2018). They also introduce a new probe for detection of Golgi-Peroxisome membrane contact sites (GoPo). Proper localization of the GoPo probe needs to be demonstrated to validate this data.</p></disp-quote><p>We agree with the reviewer and have addressed this issue extensively adding a whole additional figure to this end. Please see extensive answer to Reviewer #1 for more information.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>2. In Figure 2 the authors identify 3 proteins (Fmp27, Ypr117w, and Csf1) that colocalize with the pCLIP. The authors note that these proteins have previously been shown to localize to ER-PM sites when tagged at their C-terminus. They propose that by tagging these proteins at the N-terminus they have disrupted their endogenous localization to the ER membrane (all 3 have shown or predicted N-terminal ER transmembrane anchors) which has in part led to pCLIP colocalization. The disruption of proper ER localization by these proteins weakens their conclusions that these proteins function at the pCLIP.</p><p>For example, an alternative explanation is that N-terminal tagging leads to misfolding of the protein and therefore localization to the LD, as the LD has recently been shown to store misfolded proteins. These proteins may maintain their endogenous affinity for the plasma membrane and thereby localize to the pCLIP.</p></disp-quote><p>We agree with the reviewer’s comment and have changed the text accordingly to discuss this hypothesis.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>The authors note that C-terminal tagging of these proteins maintains targeting to the ER and PM as they are found predominantly at ER-PM contact sites. If these proteins truly function at the pCLIP, one would expect that overexpression of C-terminally tagged constructs would show pCLIP colocalization in addition to ER-PM colocalization. The authors should test the localization of at least one C-terminally tagged pCLIP protein and quantify localization to pCLIP vs. ER-PM contacts. Without this data, the conclusion than Fmp27, Ypr117w, and Scf1 are pCLIP proteins is not well supported.</p></disp-quote><p>We have C’ tagged and tried to colocalize all three proteins to the pCLIP yet their expression levels were still too low for us to detect. For this reason, we have now modified our text not to raise this suggestion.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>3. Through in silico approaches the authors demonstrate that Lec1 appears to form a large hydrophobic cavity structure similar to predictions of Mdm1 and Nvj3. They propose that these proteins are a new family of lipid binding proteins. However, as the authors did not directly assess the ability of Lec1 to bind lipids they have only shown this is a putative lipid binding protein and the tittle of this section needs to be adjusted accordingly.</p></disp-quote><p>We agree with the reviewer and have changed the title of this section. For a more extensive attempt at experimentally supporting the idea that Lec1 is a lipid binding protein, please see response to Reviewer #2.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Suggestion for future studies:</p><p>Due to the small size of organelles involved in the assessed MCSs (lipid droplets, Golgi, and peroxisomes) the authors exclude hits that only demonstrated colocalization and are known resident proteins of these small organelles. While this greatly reduces the potential for false positive hits, it also likely leads to false negatives. A secondary screen focused on this subset of proteins to identify those which may serve as tethers would provide valuable insight in a future study.</p></disp-quote><p>We agree with the reviewer and believe that these would be very interesting hits to study further. However, due to their size, we would either have to alter organelle size (e.g. culture in oleate to increase lipid droplet size – changes cellular metabolism) or use a different technique to study these hits (e.g. electron microscopy – low throughput). These are feasible options but go beyond the scope of this manuscript.</p></body></sub-article></article>
