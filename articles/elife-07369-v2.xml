invertebrates. To date, mechanical stimuli are the only means to activate Piezo ion channels and whether other modes of activation exist is not known. In this study, we screened ∼3.25 million compounds using a cell-based fluorescence assay and identified a synthetic small molecule we termed Yoda1 that acts as an agonist for both human and mouse Piezo1. Functional studies in cells revealed that Yoda1 affects the sensitivity and the inactivation kinetics of mechanically induced responses. Characterization of Yoda1 in artificial droplet lipid bilayers showed that Yoda1 activates purified Piezo1 channels in the absence of other cellular components. Our studies demonstrate that Piezo1 is amenable to chemical activation and raise the possibility that endogenous Piezo1 agonists might exist. Yoda1 will serve as a key tool compound to study Piezo1 regulation and function.</p><p><bold>DOI:</bold> <ext-link ext-link-type="doi" xlink:href="10.7554/eLife.07369.001">http://dx.doi.org/10.7554/eLife.07369.001</ext-link></p></abstract><abstract abstract-type="executive-summary"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.07369.002</object-id><title>eLife digest</title><p>Within our bodies, cells and tissues are constantly being pushed and pulled by their surrounding environment. These mechanical forces are then transformed into electrical or chemical signals by cells. This process is crucial for many biological structures, such as blood vessels, to develop correctly, and is also a key part of our senses of touch and hearing.</p><p>In 2010, researchers discovered a group of ion channels—proteins embedded in the membrane that surrounds a cell—that open up when a force is applied and allow ions such as calcium, potassium, and sodium to flow. This movement of ions generates the electrical response of the cell to the applied force. However, not much is known about how these ‘Piezo’ ion channels work. To investigate this, it is important to be able to precisely control how and when the Piezo channels open. Many other ion channels are studied by using small chemical compounds to activate them, but there were none that were known to act on Piezo proteins.</p><p>Syeda et al.—including some of the researchers involved in the 2010 work—screened over three million compounds for their ability to cause calcium ions to flow into human cells to try to identify chemicals that activate the Piezo channels. This revealed one promising candidate named Yoda1, which specifically activated Piezo1: a Piezo protein that had previously been linked to a role in blood vessel development in embryos.</p><p>To investigate how Yoda1 activates Piezo1, Syeda et al. placed Piezo1 in an artificial cell membrane that did not contain any other cellular components. When Yoda1 was added to this set up, the Piezo1 channels opened up. This suggests that Piezo1 and Yoda1 interact in a manner that does not require additional cellular components other than a cell membrane.</p><p>Separate work by Cahalan, Lukacs et al. uses Yoda1 to reveal that Piezo1 helps to control the volume of red blood cells, showing that in the future, Yoda1 could be valuable in research that investigates the roles of Piezo1.</p><p><bold>DOI:</bold> <ext-link ext-link-type="doi" xlink:href="10.7554/eLife.07369.002">http://dx.doi.org/10.7554/eLife.07369.002</ext-link></p></abstract><kwd-group kwd-group-type="author-keywords"><title>Author keywords</title><kwd>ion channel</kwd><kwd>agonist</kwd><kwd>mechanotransduction</kwd></kwd-group><kwd-group kwd-group-type="research-organism"><title>Research organism</title><kwd>None</kwd></kwd-group><funding-group><award-group id="par-1"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000011</institution-id><institution>Howard Hughes Medical Institute (HHMI)</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Patapoutian</surname><given-names>Ardem</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="par-2"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000002</institution-id><institution>National Institutes of Health (NIH)</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>NIH NS083174</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Patapoutian</surname><given-names>Ardem</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="par-3"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000002</institution-id><institution>National Institutes of Health (NIH)</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>NIH GM49711</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Montal</surname><given-names>Mauricio</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><funding-statement>The funders had no role in study design, data collection and interpretation, or the decision to submit the work for publication.</funding-statement></funding-group><custom-meta-group><custom-meta><meta-name>elife-xml-version</meta-name><meta-value>2.3</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta specific-use="meta-only"><meta-name>Author impact statement</meta-name><meta-value>A chemical activator of the mechanosensitive Piezo1 ion channel has been identified.</meta-value></custom-meta></custom-meta-group></article-meta></front><body><sec id="s1" sec-type="intro"><title>Introduction</title><p>Mechanotransduction describes processes by which mechanical forces are converted into biological responses. Mechanotransduction is essential for physiological functions including the sense of touch, hearing, and blood pressure regulation. The molecular mechanisms involved in mechanotransduction have been largely unknown, but mechanically activated cation channels are postulated to play important roles (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Delmas et al., 2011</xref>). Piezo1 and Piezo2 are necessary and sufficient for mechanically activated cation channel activity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Coste et al., 2010</xref>). These proteins are expressed in various mechanically sensitive cell types, and Piezo1 and Piezo2 have recently been shown to be required for vascular development and touch sensing, respectively (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Li et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Maksimovic et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Ranade et al., 2014a</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Ranade et al., 2014b</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Woo et al., 2014</xref>). In humans, Piezo1 gain-of-function mutations are associated with a hereditary red blood cell condition termed dehydrated hereditary stomatocytosis, while Piezo2 gain-of-function mutations are associated with three phenotypically overlapping conditions termed distal arthrogryposis type 5, Gordon Syndrome, and Marden–Walker Syndrome (Piezo2) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Albuisson et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Andolfo et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Bae et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Coste et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">McMillin et al., 2014</xref>). Piezo proteins form a distinct class of proteins with no apparent sequence similarity to other proteins and channels (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Coste et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Bae et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Nilius and Honore, 2012</xref>). They typically consist of &gt;2000 amino acids with ∼30–40 putative transmembrane segments, and Piezo1 has been shown to assemble as a homotetramer of ∼1.2 million daltons. Purified Piezo1 can be reconstituted in lipid bilayers resulting in spontaneous cation currents. This indicates that Piezos constitute channel-forming proteins, as opposed to accessory subunits (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Coste et al., 2012</xref>). Both vertebrate and invertebrate Piezo channels can be activated by mechanical stimuli suggesting an evolutionarily conserved gating mechanism geared to transduce mechanical force (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Kim et al., 2012</xref>). Indeed, to date, mechanical stimuli are the only means to activate Piezo ion channels. In comparison, temperature-activated transient receptor potential (TRP) ion channels are polymodal and are the sensors of various chemicals that cause a burning sensation such as capsaicin and mustard oil, as well as endogenous compounds that cause inflammation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Julius, 2013</xref>). Studies on the chemical activation of TRP channels have been crucial to understand the physiological role of these channels and have contributed to mechanistic appreciation of how these ion channels are gated (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Jordt and Julius, 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Bandell et al., 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Macpherson et al., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Cao et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Julius, 2013</xref>). The discovery of a chemical agonist of Piezo channels could thus benefit the study of mechanotransduction.</p></sec><sec id="s2" sec-type="results|discussion"><title>Results and discussion</title><p>We set out to probe Piezos for chemical-mediated activation. As Piezos are calcium-permeable channels, we hypothesized that Piezo activity could be monitored using calcium-sensitive fluorophores. We tested this by overexpressing Piezo1 in human embryonic kidney (HEK) cells and monitoring intracellular calcium in response to pressure exerted on the cell via a blunt glass probe. In Piezo1 expressing cells, a sequence of mechanical stimulations using a piezo-electric driven probe caused reversible calcium responses that increased with increasing probe displacement until ultimately an irreversible Ca<sup>2+</sup> signal ensued as a consequence of membrane rupture. In contrast, control cells showed no reversible responses and only irreversible calcium flux upon cell perforation was observed. (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1A</xref>). This suggested that Piezo1-mediated calcium flux could be measured via calcium fluorophores. With the objective to identify either a Piezo1 or Piezo2 agonist, we co-transfected HEK cells with mPiezo1 and mPiezo2 cDNAs and screened a collection of ∼3.25 million low molecular weight (LMW) compounds for their ability to induce calcium influx in these cells. This led us to identify a synthetic compound that elicits Ca<sup>2+</sup> flux in Piezo1- but not vector-transfected cells; we named this compound Yoda1 (see ‘Materials and methods’ and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1D</xref> for screen and Yoda1 details). Yoda1-induced calcium responses depended largely on calcium influx as the chelation of extracellular calcium dramatically reduced the responses, while the depletion of intracellular calcium stores using thapsigargin did not (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1B</xref>). Still, calcium-chelating conditions did not completely abolish the responses, raising the possibility of some functional Piezo1 in intracellular membranes upon overexpression. Concentration-response experiments showed that Yoda1 at micromolar concentrations induced robust Ca<sup>2+</sup> responses in cells transfected with either human or mouse Piezo1, but not Piezo2-transfected cells, indicating its selectivity for Piezo1 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1C</xref>). At higher Yoda1 concentrations (&gt;∼20 μM), the solutions became increasingly opaque. Therefore, the apparent EC<sub>50</sub> is likely affected by compound insolubility and may not allow meaningful interpretation. We further tested six distinct hPiezo1 mutants that we previously identified in xerocytosis patients and which exhibited increased mechanically induced currents (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Albuisson et al., 2013</xref>). Invariably, the Yoda1-induced calcium responses were bigger in cells transfected with these mutant channels than cells transfected with wild-type Piezo1, consistent with their gain-of-function phenotype (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1</xref>). The effect of Yoda1 appears to critically depend on the dichloro substitution (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1D</xref>), as similar compounds present in the collection lacking the chlorines were not identified in the screen (data not shown). Furthermore, the oxidation state of the thioether group appears critical as no activity could be observed with the sulfone analog (tested at ≤30 μM, data not shown).<fig-group><fig id="fig1" position="float"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.07369.003</object-id><label>Figure 1.</label><caption><title>A high-throughput screen identifies a Piezo1 activating chemical, Yoda1.</title><p>(<bold>A</bold>) mPiezo1 mediates Ca<sup>2+</sup> influx upon mechanical activation.

In HEK cells transiently transfected with mPiezo1, using a cell-attached patch configuration, currents were measured before and during a series of increasing negative pressures applied via the recording pipette. The presence of Yoda1 caused multiple distinct effects. Firstly, Yoda1 caused a dramatic change in the kinetics of the mechanical responses, as it notably slowed the inactivation phase of the transient currents (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2A</xref>). Secondly, Yoda1 sensitized mPiezo1 to activation by pressure as indicated by a leftward shift in the current–pressure relationship, reducing the half maximal activation pressure (P50) by about 15 mm Hg (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2B,C</xref>). Lastly, in the absence of negative pressure, we observed small currents in Yoda1-exposed patches. The Yoda1-dependent currents were a fraction of those attained by stretch: 9.0 ± 2.2% of the maximal attainable current compared to 1.5 ± 0.4% in control patches without Yoda1 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2B,D,E</xref>). These results suggest that Yoda1 both modifies Piezo1 mechanotransduction currents and partially activates Piezo1 in the absence of externally applied pressure (note, however, that some membrane tension exists in cell-attached patches even prior to the application of negative pressure) The partial activation of Piezo1 by Yoda1 might be due to a variety of reasons, including (1) an indirect mechanism of action (but see below), (2) an inefficacious gating mechanism (i.e., acting as a gating modifier instead of a full agonist), or (3) a very high actual EC<sub>50</sub> (see comment on insolubility above). We also tested the effect of Yoda1 (10 μM) in whole-cell configuration, where mechanical pressure can be applied using a piezoelectric-driven glass probe. This concentration did not lead to measurable mPiezo1 currents in the absence of pressure but did cause a clear slowing of the inactivation phase of the mechanically activated currents, similar to the cell-attached patch experiments (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2F,G</xref>). No such change in kinetics could be observed for Piezo2 consistent with Yoda1 having a Piezo1 selective effect (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2H</xref>).<fig id="fig2" position="float"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.07369.005</object-id><label>Figure 2.</label><caption><title>Yoda1 functions as a gating modifier of Piezo1.</title><p>(<bold>A</bold>–<bold>E</bold>) mPiezo1-transfected HEK293T cells, cell-attached patch configuration.

To address this, we set out to test its effect on purified mPiezo1 reconstituted in droplet interface lipid bilayers (DIBs). Previously, we reconstituted purified mPiezo1 channels into asymmetric DIBs containing DiPhytanoyl-sn-glycero-3-PhosphoCholine (DPhPC) and 1,2-dioleoyl-sn-glycero-3-phosphate (DOPA) and observed spontaneous cation-selective channel activity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Coste et al., 2012</xref>). Here, to study mPiezo1 activation, we utilized symmetric DIBs made up of only DPhPC in which reconstituted mPiezo1 does not show constitutive activity (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3A</xref>). Application of 1 μM Yoda1-induced discernable single-channel currents with a conductance similar to what we previously observed for spontaneously active mPiezo1 in asymmetric bilayers (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3B</xref>). Higher Yoda1 concentrations yielded robust currents with a staircase-like appearance, indicating the presence of multiple (30–40) functional channels (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3C,D</xref>).<fig id="fig3" position="float"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.07369.006</object-id><label>Figure 3.</label><caption><title>Yoda1 activates mPiezo1 in a membrane-delimited fashion.</title><p>(<bold>A</bold>) Electrical recordings of reconstituted mPiezo1 in the symmetric DiPhytanoyl-sn-glycero-3-PhosphoCholine (DPhPC) bilayers and corresponding all point current histograms without the application of Yoda1.

The channel exhibited closed dwell-time distributions that fitted well to a two-component probability density function; τ<sub>1 closed</sub> = 3 ± 1 ms and τ<sub>2</sub> <sub>closed</sub> = 57 ± 15 ms. The two time constants differ in duration by &gt; 10-fold, a property of a bursting channel, where τ<sub>1 closed</sub> is the closed time within a burst, and τ<sub>2 closed</sub> is the closed time between bursts. The open dwell time is fitted to a single-component probability density function with characteristic mean open time τ <sub>open</sub> = 55 ± 9 ms. Although, no direct comparison can be made for mPiezo1 parameters with and without Yoda1 (due to lack of mPiezo1 activity in symmetric bilayers without Yoda1), we analyzed single-channel properties of mPiezo1 acquired in asymmetric bilayers without Yoda1 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3F</xref>). In an asymmetric bilayer, the channel exhibited characteristic bursting pattern with two closed time distributions, τ<sub>1 closed</sub> = 5 ± 1 ms, τ<sub>2</sub> <sub>closed</sub> = 47 ± 9 ms, and an open time distribution τ <sub>open</sub> = 13 ± 4 ms. The significant difference in τ <sub>open</sub> (13 ± 4 ms vs 55 ± 9 ms) suggests that mPiezo1 remains open for longer times in the presence of Yoda1. No significant change was observed in τ <sub>closed</sub>, suggesting that Yoda1 mainly stabilizes the open state rather than destabilizing the closed state.</p><p>A detailed biophysical analysis will be required to understand the mechanism of action of Yoda1. Our present analysis provides the first steps towards this goal. For instance, our lipid bilayer experiments suggest that Yoda1 does not require other proteins or specific lipid domains to exert an effect on Piezo1. This suggests its effect is either directly on the channel or via long-range membrane-delimited effects, for instance through a change in membrane tension or curvature of the membrane. Indeed, compounds that modify membrane curvature are known to affect mechanically sensitive ion channels (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Patel et al., 1998</xref>). However, such compounds are typically amphipaths which Yoda1 is not (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Sheetz and Singer, 1974</xref>). More importantly, the effect of Yoda1 appears governed by stringent structural requirements both on the side of the chemical and on the side of the channel (as no effect on Piezo2 was observed), fitting a model in which Yoda1 directly interacts with Piezo1.</p><p>Our electrophysiological experiments in cells suggest that Yoda1 prominently affects the sensitivity and the inactivation kinetics of mechanically induced responses but at best causes a slight mPiezo1 activation in the absence of mechanical stimuli. In the bilayer system, we observed that Yoda1 stabilizes the open channel, potentially explaining the slowing of mPiezo1 inactivation kinetics observed in cells. However, we also observe prominent Yoda1-dependent calcium responses in cell culture and currents in artificial bilayers in the absence of externally applied forces. Therefore, the discrepancy in various levels of channel activity observed with different assays used here remains unexplained, and future in-depth understanding of mechanism of Yoda1 action on Piezo1 might shed light on these apparently disparate observations. Regardless, we show in an accompanying paper that Yoda1 causes Piezo1-dependent red blood cell dehydration, arguing for sufficient activation of the ion channel in the absence of external forces to cause a robust physiological impact.</p><p>Irrespective of whether Yoda1 acts as a full activator or as a positive modulator, our results suggest that we have identified the first Piezo1 agonist. This finding is important from two perspectives. Firstly, our studies provide the first evidence of non-mechanical activation of a Piezo channel, suggesting that Piezo1 gating does not exclusively depend on changes in mechanical force. This is important, since it raises the possibility that endogenous agonists of Piezo1 exist which may play an important role in modulating mechanotransduction. Secondly, Yoda1 will provide a valuable tool to facilitate studies aimed at elucidating Piezo1 gating mechanism and exploring its functional significance in various biological processes (see for instance accompanying paper).</p></sec><sec id="s3" sec-type="materials|methods"><title>Materials and methods</title><sec id="s3-1"><title>Ratiometric calcium imaging</title><sec id="s3-1-1"><title>Cell culture and transient transfection</title><p>HEK293T cells were grown in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium containing 4.5 mg/ml glucose, 10% fetal bovine serum, 1× antibiotics/antimycotics.

Your article has been favorably evaluated by Janet Rossant (Senior editor), a Reviewing editor, and three reviewers. Two of the reviewers, Eric Honoré and Jon Levine, have agreed to share their identity.</p><p>The Reviewing editor and the reviewers discussed their comments before we reached this decision, and the Reviewing editor has assembled the following comments to help you prepare a revised submission. We are including the three reviews (lightly edited) at the end of this letter, as there are some specific and useful suggestions in them that will not be repeated in the summary here. All of the reviewers were impressed with the importance and novelty of your work.</p><p><italic>Reviewer #1:</italic></p><p>In the manuscript “Chemical activation of the mechanotransduction channel Piezo1”, the authors report the first chemical agonist (Obi1) of the mechanically activated ion channel Piezo1. The molecule was identified by an unbiased screen of an impressive ∼3 million compound library. The authors use a combination of calcium-imaging, detailed single channel and whole-cell and artificial bilayer electrophysiology to convincingly show that Obi1 is in fact an agonist acting specifically on Piezo1, but not Piezo2.</p><p>This finding is important, because it is the first demonstration that this mechanically activated ion channel can also be gated chemically. Due to the astronomical number of screened molecules and the fact that only one hit was identified this molecule is highly unlikely to be identified otherwise and it highlights how unique it is (and probably will be). Having this molecule is significant to study Piezo-related mechanisms and the authors demonstrate this nicely in the accompanying manuscript.</p><p>I find this study very impressive and highly interesting. The authors go beyond any reasonable effort in order to convincingly show how Obi1 acts on Piezo1 mechanistically. Thus I have no suggestions for improvements and only a few minor points.</p><p>1) <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3E</xref>: It is better to plot the square root of counts instead of counts as this leads to normalization of error bars (although not plotted) in all bins.</p><p>2) The chemical structure of Obi1 should be in the main manuscript and not the supplement and the two functional groups tested (chloridine and thioether) should be highlighted.</p><p><italic>Reviewer #2:</italic></p><p>This interesting manuscript reports the discovery of a specific opener for the mechano-sensitive ion channel Piezo1. The Obi1 compound shifts the pressure-effect curve leftward and removes inactivation. Remarkably, this opener works after reconstitution of Piezo1 into an artificial bilayer. Those findings are conceptually important as it demonstrates that this mammalian stretch-activated ion channel can also be opened by an agonist in the absence of mechanical stress. This study also suggests that a natural opener of Piezo1 may possibly exist. I believe that this report is important for a better understanding of cellular mechanotransduction and will certainly be a highly cited paper.</p><p>The discovery of the Piezo channels, of their function and pharmacology represent a major step in our understanding of molecular mechanotransduction. I only have a few suggestions which may help to further improve this manuscript. However, those points are optional and I feel that the present paper could be published in its present form.</p><p>Minor points and suggestions:</p><p>1) Why does fluorescence goes down in the control cells (pcDNA3.1 + Obi1), as shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1B</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1C</xref>?</p><p>2) There is no basal Piezo1 opening in a reconstituted symmetric bilayer, unlike with asymmetric bilayer as previously reported by the same authors. Can you apply mechanical stress on the symmetric bilayer and now demonstrate that force gates the purified and reconstituted Piezo1?</p><p>3) Is the effect of Obi1 reversed by the peptide GsTMx-4, which is also a gating modifier?</p><p>4) Is the effect of Obi1 mimicked by the anionic amphipathic crenator trinitrophenol? (Although, Obi1 does not work on Piezo2 and a non-specific bilayer effect seems unlikely. Nevertheless, one may imagine that Piezo1 might be more sensitive than Piezo2 to bilayer stress).</p><p>5) In the same line, is the effect of Obi1 reversed by the amphipathic cup-former chlorpromazine?</p><p>6) Of course a key point would be the discovery of natural opener for Piezo1. Any idea?</p><p>7) Please indicate the charge of the molecule at a physiological pH (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1–figure supplement 1</xref>).</p><p>8) Can you please cite the review of Nilius-TINS about Piezo1?</p><p>9) Please cite the work of Sachs and collaborators, reporting the modulation of Piezo1 by the gating modifier GsTMx-4?</p><p><italic>Reviewer #3:</italic></p><p>The Patapoutian group, that discovered Piezo 1 and 2, have begun the long hard process of drugging these ion channels. In this first manuscript to come from this work, they have successfully isolated a Piezo 1 (and not Piezo 2) agonist, from a library of 2.5 million compounds. Given the rapidity with which the new field of Piezo biology has developed, this compound will be immensely useful to a growing number of investigators interested in the role of Piezo 1 in physiology and pathophysiology.</p></body></sub-article><sub-article article-type="reply" id="SA2"><front-stub><article-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.07369.008</article-id><title-group><article-title>Author response</article-title></title-group></front-stub><body><p>We thank the reviewers for their constructive input.
