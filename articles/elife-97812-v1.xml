Because fertilization occurs during oocyte meiosis in most animal species, there is an inherent risk of sperm DNA being incorporated into the meiotic spindle and being expelled into a polar body. In some species, the first line of defense against this hypothetical calamity is ensuring that sperm does not fuse with the oocyte plasma membrane directly over the meiotic spindle. A Ran-GTP gradient emanating from the mouse metaphase II meiotic spindle excludes the fusion proteins Juno and CD9 from the oocyte plasma membrane over the spindle. When this mechanism was bypassed by injecting demembranated sperm adjacent to the spindle, the sperm DNA was ejected into a polar body (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">Mori et al., 2021</xref>). In <italic>C. elegans</italic>, the nucleus is positioned away from the site of future fertilization so that the meiosis I spindle assembles at the opposite end of the ellipsoid zygote from the site of fertilization (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">Panzica and McNally, 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">McNally et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">McCarter et al., 1999</xref>).</p><p>However, simply controlling the site of fertilization is not sufficient to maintain a distance between the meiotic spindle and the sperm DNA because cytoplasmic streaming can move the sperm DNA long distances in both mouse (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">Mori et al., 2021</xref>) and <italic>C. elegans</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Panzica et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Kimura and Kimura, 2020</xref>). Meiotic cytoplasmic streaming in <italic>C. elegans</italic> embryos requires microtubules (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib45">Yang et al., 2003</xref>), kinesin-1 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">McNally et al., 2010</xref>), and reticulons (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Kimura et al., 2017</xref>), but both mechanism and purpose are not completely understood. In addition to meiotic spindle microtubules, <italic>C. elegans</italic> meiotic embryos have cytoplasmic microtubules around the cortex and throughout the cytoplasm of the entire embryo (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">McNally et al., 2010</xref>). These microtubules are thought to drive meiotic cytoplasmic streaming because depletion of tubulin stops cytoplasmic streaming (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib45">Yang et al., 2003</xref>) and depletion of the microtubule-severing protein katanin by RNAi results in an increased mass of cortical microtubules and an increase in cytoplasmic streaming (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Kimura et al., 2017</xref>).</p><p>In addition to paternal DNA, <italic>C. elegans</italic> sperm introduce centrioles, SPE-11 protein, membranous organelles (MOs), and paternal mitochondria into the zygote. Paternal centrioles are silenced during meiosis by maternal KCA-1 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">McNally et al., 2012</xref>), which is also required to pack yolk granules inward from the cortex (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">McNally et al., 2010</xref>) and the meiotic spindle outward toward the cortex (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib46">Yang et al., 2005</xref>). SPE-11 is an RNA-binding protein in sperm (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Li et al., 2023</xref>) that is required paternally for polar body extrusion (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">McNally and McNally, 2005</xref>) and proper embryonic development (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Hill et al., 1989</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Browning and Strome, 1996</xref>). MOs are membrane vesicles in sperm that fuse with the sperm plasma membrane before fertilization during sperm activation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">L’Hernault, 2006</xref>). However, a subset of MOs that do not fuse with the sperm plasma membrane are introduced to the zygote at fertilization and are ubiquitinated with maternal ubiquitin (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Molina et al., 2019</xref>). Paternal mitochondria are labeled with maternal autophagy machinery (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">Sato and Sato, 2011</xref>). Whereas both MOs and paternal mitochondria are eventually destroyed during embryogenesis, during meiosis they remain in a tight cloud around the sperm DNA (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Panzica et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Molina et al., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">Sato and Sato, 2011</xref>). The mechanisms holding the sperm contents together in the zygote during cytoplasmic streaming have not been explored.</p><p>In this study, we monitored the cloud of paternal mitochondria after increasing cytoplasmic streaming or disrupting the integrity of the cloud of paternal organelles. Our results suggest that both limiting cytoplasmic streaming and maintaining the integrity of the paternal organelle cloud contribute to preventing the capture of the sperm contents by the meiotic spindle.</p></sec><sec id="s2" sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><sec id="s2-1"><title>Sperm-derived DNA and mitochondria are maintained in a volume that excludes maternal mitochondria and yolk granules but allows penetration by maternal ER during meiosis</title><p>Time-lapse in utero imaging of the meiotic spindle and an endoplasmic reticulum marker (ER) revealed that the ER is distributed throughout the zygote but appears as undulating lines during metaphase I (n=8), changes to a dispersed appearance during anaphase I (n=9), transitions back to undulating lines interspersed with large blobs during metaphase II (n=6), then changes to a dispersed pattern during anaphase II (n=5) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1A</xref>; <xref ref-type="video" rid="fig1video1">Figure 1—video 1</xref>).

Both the cloud of paternal mitochondria (n=19) and the meiotic spindle (n=9 metaphase I) were observed in cortical regions that are free of yolk granules (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1B</xref>).

Time-lapse imaging (n=21) revealed that the cloud of paternal mitochondria remained together and separate from maternal yolk granules even when moving long distances with cytoplasmic streaming (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1D</xref>).</p><p>Because yolk granules and maternal mitochondria are packed inward during meiosis (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1B and C</xref>) and sperm must enter from the outside, it is possible that the exclusion of maternal yolk granules from the volume of paternal mitochondria might simply be a consequence of inward packing.

To elucidate how the maternal ER enters the ball of paternal organelles, we monitored seven instances of sperm-egg fusion by time-lapse microscopy. Previous studies have demonstrated that <italic>C. elegans</italic> sperm fuse with the egg as opposed to being phagocytosed (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib42">Takayama and Onami, 2016</xref>). Mitotracker-labeled males were mated with hermaphrodites with a maternally-expressed ER marker and a maternally-expressed plasma membrane marker (mCherry::PH). 20 s after the apparent entry of paternal mitochondria into the egg (0:20 in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3B</xref>), a sperm-sized volume devoid of maternal ER was observed within the maternal plasma membrane. One minute after apparent sperm-egg fusion, the maternal ER had moved into the plasma membrane behind the sperm (1:25 in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3B</xref>; 1:00 in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3C</xref>). The maternal ER ring enveloping the sperm DNA was not discernible until 7 min after apparent sperm-egg fusion (7:24 in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3C</xref>), although it might form earlier because the zygote undergoes dramatic movement through two sequential sphincters into the spermatheca then into the uterus during this time. The envelopment of the sperm DNA by maternal ER may be an initial step in nuclear envelope assembly (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">Penfield et al., 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Barger et al., 2023</xref>), which has been halted until after the completion of meiosis. These results show that maternal ER is initially excluded from the sperm at fusion. Since maternal mitochondria and yolk granules are excluded later, this suggests that all maternal membranes are initially excluded from the sperm at fusion. The plasma membrane marker diffuses in behind the sperm first, followed by plasma-membrane-associated ER, followed by envelopment of the sperm DNA by maternal ER by 7 min after fusion. Maternal yolk granules and maternal mitochondria, however, are excluded from the sperm volume for much longer (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1</xref>).</p><fig id="fig3" position="float"><label>Figure 3.</label><caption><title>Maternal endoplasmic reticulum (ER) enters the sperm cytoplasm after a delay and forms a ring around sperm DNA.</title><p>(<bold>A</bold>) Live and fixed images of anaphase I and metaphase I embryos show an ER ring within the sperm cytoplasm (as indicated by sperm mitochondria).

Standard deviation is an important measure because an increase in the number of mitochondria both closer and further from the sperm DNA would result in no change in the mean. It remains possible that paternal mitochondria scatter is caused by pressure applied during fixation, pressure resulting from ovulation through the spermatheca valves, or cytoplasmic streaming. We were not able to unambiguously track scattering by live imaging because significant movement occurs during the acquisition of a complete z stack and because the embryos cannot withstand the additional photodamage.

The simplest hypothesis is that maternal and paternal cytoplasm might not mix during the 45 min from GVBD to pronucleus formation due to the high viscosity of cytoplasm. Attempts at measuring the cytoplasmic viscosity of the <italic>C. elegans</italic> zygote have revealed values from 0.67 to 1.0 Pa s (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Khatri et al., 2022</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Daniels et al., 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Garzon-Coral et al., 2016</xref>) which are similar to the viscosity of 100% glycerol. Alternatively, the sperm contents might be held together by a cytoskeleton-like matrix as proposed for the Balbiani body (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Boke et al., 2016</xref>). In either case, an active process appears to allow the maternal ER to penetrate into the paternal cytoplasm to envelope the sperm DNA. The capture of the sperm DNA by the meiotic spindle in ATX-2 KLP-7 double-depleted embryos (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig9">Figure 9</xref>) suggests that the integrity of the exclusion zone around the sperm DNA might insulate the sperm DNA from spindle microtubules. However, a much larger number of <italic>klp-7(RNAi</italic>) singly depleted and <italic>atx-2(degron</italic>) singly depleted time-lapse sequences are needed to rigorously support this idea.</p><p>ATX-2 is required to maintain the integrity of the ball of paternal mitochondria around the sperm DNA (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figures 7</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8">8</xref>), but the mechanism is unknown. Because the paternal mitochondria observed to scatter are from wild-type males, the effect of ATX-2 depletion must be on the egg and not on the sperm. Although ATX-2 depletion alters ER morphology (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Del Castillo et al., 2019</xref>) we still observed a maternal ER envelope around the sperm DNA in all ATX-2-depleted embryos. ATX-2 also plays roles in translational regulation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Ciosk et al., 2004</xref>), germline proliferation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Maine et al., 2004</xref>), cytokinesis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Gnazzo et al., 2016</xref>), centrosome size (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib41">Stubenvoll et al., 2016</xref>), and fat metabolism (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Bar et al., 2016</xref>). Thus the effects of ATX-2 could be extremely indirect. Because <italic>C. elegans</italic> ovulate every 23 min (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">McCarter et al., 1999</xref>), however, our rapid 1 hr depletion would only affect the three most mature oocytes. A speculative possibility is that ATX-2 regulates ‘the integrity of the cytoplasm’ analogous to the action of ANC-1 in the <italic>C. elegans</italic> hypodermis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Hao et al., 2021</xref>). Because ATX-2 is an RNA-binding protein with intrinsically disordered domains, it might act as part of the RNA-dependent ER-associated TIS granule network (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Ma et al., 2021</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Ma and Mayr, 2018</xref>).</p><p>In control embryos, the sperm contents rarely came near the meiotic spindle (18 µm closest distance, see text above) in agreement with a previous study that found that male and female pronuclei rarely form next to each other (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Kimura and Kimura, 2020</xref>). Streaming of the sperm contents was most commonly restricted to a jostling motion with little net displacement, circular streaming in the short-axis of the embryo, or long-axis streaming in which the sperm turned away from the spindle before the halfway point of the embryo (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5</xref>). Depletion of MEI-1 or KLP-7 resulted in longer excursions of the sperm contents in the long-axis of the embryo toward the spindle (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5</xref>) but frequent capture of the sperm by the spindle was only observed in <italic>mei-1(RNAi</italic>) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figures 5</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig9">9D</xref>). This may be because <italic>mei-1(RNAi</italic>) affects the positioning of the spindle within the embryo (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib45">Yang et al., 2003</xref>) or because the altered structure of the <italic>mei-1(RNAi</italic>) spindle allows spindle microtubules to capture chromosomes further from the spindle center.

Exposures were 200ms for the ORCA FLASH 4.0 qCMOS detector and 100ms for the ORCA-Quest qCMOS detector. Time interval between image pairs or trios was 5 s. Focus was adjusted manually during time-lapse imaging.</p><p>For the ATX-2 images in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6</xref>, z-stacks of –1 oocytes of anesthetized live worms were captured with a Zeiss LSM 980 confocal microscope with Airyscan 2 and a Zeiss Objective LD LCI Plan-Apochromat 40 x/1.2 Imm Corr DIC M27 for water, silicon oil or glycerine.</p></sec><sec id="s4-3"><title>Fixed immunofluorescence</title><p><italic>C. elegans</italic> meiotic embryos were extruded from hermaphrodites in 0.8x egg buffer by gently compressing worms between a coverslip and a slide, flash frozen in liquid N2, permeabilized by removing the coverslip, and then fixed in ice-cold methanol before staining with antibodies and DAPI. The primary antibodies used in this work were mouse monoclonal anti-tubulin (DM1α; Thermo Fisher Scientific; 1:200) and rabbit anti-GFP (NB600-308; Novus Biologicals; 1:600). The secondary antibodies used were Alexa Fluor 488 anti-rabbit (A-21206; Thermo Fisher Scientific; 1:200), Alexa Fluor 488 anti-mouse (A-21202; Thermo Fisher Scientific; 1:200), and Alexa Fluor 594 anti-mouse (A-21203; Thermo Fisher Scientific; 1:200). Z-stacks were captured at 1 μm steps for meiotic embryos using the same microscope described above for live imaging.</p></sec><sec id="s4-4"><title>Sperm ER ring filming</title><p>For sperm ER ring filming, the ring was observed throughout meiosis I and II and manually kept in the focal plane by adjusting the stage (z-axis). Filming typically began at spermatheca exit or meiosis I and ended at pronuclear formation or cell arrest. Due to the rigors of filming an embryo with optimal orientation and positioning in the uterus, videos that started and ended mid-phases were still filmed and included in measurements so long as a complete phase was included between starting and ending filming (e.g. AI and MII were measured in videos starting mid-MI and ending mid-AII). In these cases when filming started mid-phase and/or ended prematurely mid-phase, the incompletely filmed phases were not included in quantifications. The phases at which cell arrest occurred were not included in quantifications, but the phases prior were still used.</p></sec><sec id="s4-5"><title>Sperm ER ring tracking</title><p>Measurements of the ER rings’ dynamics in videos of embryos were tracked manually using the Fiji plugin MTrackJ. All embryos quantified were rotated such that at the beginning of each video the pole containing the meiotic spindle was at the left. Only embryos measured at &gt;35 µm long were used for ER ring tracking. Embryos measured &lt;35 µm were tilted and not ideal for tracking. The starting and ending frames of each cell phase were then determined based on ER morphology. Individual tracks for each phase were manually made by clicking on the center of the ER ring, or in cases when it was briefly out of focus, the mitochondria that most closely followed where the ER ring was previously seen. The following criteria was used for determining phases to be quantified by tracks:</p><list list-type="simple"><list-item><p>Metaphase I: Starts when the embryo becomes stationary after exiting spermatheca into the uterus and ends when ER reticulation becomes dispersed.</p></list-item><list-item><p>Anaphase I: Starts when ER becomes dispersed and ends when it begins to reticulate.</p></list-item><list-item><p>Metaphase II: Starts when ER begins to reticulate and ends when it becomes dispersed.</p></list-item><list-item><p>Anaphase II: Starts when ER becomes dispersed and ends at paternal pronuclear formation.</p></list-item><list-item><p>Maximum X-axis displacement was quantified by subtracting the minimum x-axis coordinate of a phase’s track from the maximum x-axis coordinate.</p></list-item><list-item><p>Maximum Y-axis displacement was quantified by subtracting the minimum y-axis coordinate of a phase’s track from the maximum y-axis coordinate.</p></list-item></list><p>Displacement was measured as the distance between the first point of a phase’s track and the last point.</p><p>Distance Traveled was measured as the total length of the track that the sperm ring traveled.</p><p>Maximum Average Velocity was measured by taking the maximum of 3-point moving averages of velocities in each phase. MTrackJ was used to measure the velocity of the ER ring between each video frame.</p><p>Duration of Phases were calculated by subtracting the first frame number of a phase from the last one and multiplying by 5 due to the 5- s intervals.</p></sec><sec id="s4-6"><title>Paternal mitochondria scattering quantifications</title><p>Paternal mitochondrial scattering was calculated by using a circular ROI to measure the mean value fluorescence of Deep Red MitoTracker FM or Red MitoTracker CMXros labeling paternal mitochondria in meiotic embryos. Mean pixel values were taken using a circle ROI with an 18-pixel diameter to cover the entire area of a region of fluorescence that appeared as a punctum (unless specified otherwise due to a different resolution). This was repeated until all puncta fluorescence in an embryo were measured. For every embryo, a region of cytoplasm without mitochondria had its fluorescence measured. This value was subtracted from every mitochondrial measurement to correct for noise. The distances between the center of each punctum and the center of the paternal DNA were then recorded with a line tool. The Pythagorean theorem was used to determine the distance when the mitochondria were in a different z-stack than the paternal DNA. These distances were recorded in column scatter graphs to observe the distribution of mitochondrial distance from sperm DNA quantitatively. To measure large amorphous masses of mitochondria, the same sized ROI measuring fluorescence in distinct puncta was used to cover a portion of the mass, make measurements, and then moved to another portion to make more measurements. This was repeated until the entire area of the mass had its fluorescence measured. The corresponding distances to the paternal DNA were recorded for every ROI used. The mean value fluorescence of the amorphous masses were typically much greater than the distinct puncta and as such presumably had a greater density of mitochondria per ROI than the puncta. In order to account for this density, the mean values measured from the ROI’s over the masses were divided by the average of the mean values of all of the puncta in an embryo. This resulting number was then used to determine how many times the distance between the paternal DNA and the ROI was recorded in the column scatter graphs (e.g. if the rounded value was 2 then the distance was recorded twice). The averages and standard deviations of each distribution of mitochondrial distances from paternal DNA in the embryos were then measured in order to compare the scattering of mitochondria in different experimental treatments. Quantifications were done in meiotic embryos of all phases except metaphase I. Since this phase is right after fertilization, we believe embryos do not have the time to exhibit scattering as a phenotype.</p></sec><sec id="s4-7"><title>Paternal mitochondria labeling</title><p>L4 <italic>fog-2(q71</italic>) males were picked onto an OP50 plate and treated with 200 µL 0.05 mM working stock of MitoTracker Deep Red FM (Invitrogen) or MitoTracker Red CMXros (Invitrogen) in M9 overnight.

The authors show that by time-lapse video, paternal mitochondria (used as a readout for sperm and its genome) is excluded from yolk granules and maternal mitochondria, even when moving long distances by cytoplasmic streaming. To understand how this exclusion is accomplished, they first show that it is independent of both internal packing and the engulfment of the paternal chromosomes by the maternal endoplasmic reticulum creating an impermeable barrier. They then test whether the control of cytoplasmic steaming affects this exclusion by knocking down two microtubule motors, Katanin and kinesis I. They find that the ER ring, which is used as a proxy for paternal chromosomes, undergoes extensive displacement with these treatments during anaphase I and interacts with the meiotic spindle, supporting their hypothesis that the exclusion of paternal chromosomes is regulated by cytoplasmic streaming. Next, they test whether a regulator of maternal ER organization, ATX-2, disrupts sperm organization so that they can combine the double depletion of ATX-2 and KLP-7, presumably because klp-7 RNAi (unlike mei-1 RNAi) does not affect polar body extrusion and they can report on what happens to paternal chromosomes. They find that the knockdown of both ATX-2 and KLP-7 produces a higher incidence of what appears to be the capture of paternal chromosomes by the meiotic spindle (5/24 vs 1/25). However, this capture event appears to halt the cell cycle, preventing the authors from directly observing whether this would result in the paternal chromosomes being ejected into the polar body.</p><p>The authors addressed the vast majority of the Reviewer's comments including the addition of new figures, re-wording of data interpretation and discussion points to better reflect the claims of the paper. There remain a few outstanding points which were not addressed.</p><p>In many cases the number of embryos analyzed or events capture remains low and the authors conclude that these sample sizes prevented statistical significance.

A specific example of this is given below:</p><p>In the double knockdown of ATX-2 and KLP-7, there was no significant difference between single and double knockdowns and the ER ring displacement was not analyzed in this double mutant. Further, there was no difference in the frequency of sperm capture between single and double ATX-2 and KLP-7 due to low sample size, the the strength of the conclusion of this manuscript would be greatly improved if both of these results were further explored.</p></body></sub-article><sub-article article-type="author-comment" id="sa2"><front-stub><article-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.97812.3.sa2</article-id><title-group><article-title>Author response</article-title></title-group><contrib-group><contrib contrib-type="author"><name><surname>Beath</surname><given-names>Elizabeth A</given-names></name><role specific-use="author">Author</role><aff><institution>University of California, Davis</institution><addr-line><named-content content-type="city">Davis</named-content></addr-line><country>United States</country></aff></contrib><contrib contrib-type="author"><name><surname>Bailey</surname><given-names>Cynthia</given-names></name><role specific-use="author">Author</role><aff><institution>University of California, Davis</institution><addr-line><named-content content-type="city">Davis</named-content></addr-line><country>United States</country></aff></contrib><contrib contrib-type="author"><name><surname>Mahantesh Magadam</surname><given-names>Meghana</given-names></name><role specific-use="author">Author</role><aff><institution>University of California, Davis</institution><addr-line><named-content content-type="city">Davis</named-content></addr-line><country>United States</country></aff></contrib><contrib contrib-type="author"><name><surname>Qiu</surname><given-names>Shuyan</given-names></name><role specific-use="author">Author</role><aff><institution>University of California, Davis</institution><addr-line><named-content content-type="city">Davis</named-content></addr-line><country>United States</country></aff></contrib><contrib contrib-type="author"><name><surname>McNally</surname><given-names>Karen L</given-names></name><role specific-use="author">Author</role><aff><institution>University of California, Davis</institution><addr-line><named-content content-type="city">Davis</named-content></addr-line><country>United States</country></aff></contrib><contrib contrib-type="author"><name><surname>McNally</surname><given-names>Francis J</given-names></name><role specific-use="author">Author</role><aff><institution>University of California, Davis</institution><addr-line><named-content content-type="city">Davis</named-content></addr-line><country>United States</country></aff></contrib></contrib-group></front-stub><body><p>The following is the authors’ response to the original reviews.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Public Reviews:</p><p><bold>Reviewer #1 (Public Review):</bold></p><p>Summary:</p><p>This paper by Beath et. al. identifies a potential regulatory role for proteins involved in cytoplasmic streaming and maintaining the grouping of paternal organelles: holding sperm contents in the fertilized embryos away from the oocyte meiotic spindle so that they don't get ejected into the polar body during meiotic chromosome segregation.

Previous work, much of which by this group, had characterized cytoplasmic streaming in the zygote and the behavior of paternal components shortly after fertilization, primarily the clustering of paternal mitochondria and membranous organelles around the paternal chromosomes. This work set out to identify the molecular mechanisms responsible for that clustering and test the specific hypothesis that the &quot;paternal cloud&quot; helps prevent the association of paternal chromosomes with the meiotic spindle.</p><p>Strengths</p><p>This work is a collection of technical achievements. The data are primarily 3- and 4-channel time-lapse images of zygotes shortly after fertilization, which were performed inside intact animals. There are many instances in which the experiments show extreme technical skill, such as tracking the paternal chromosomes over large displacements throughout the volume of the embryo. The authors employ a wide variety of fluorescent reporters to provide a remarkably clear picture of what is going on in the zygote. These reagents and the novel characterization of these stages that they provide will be widely beneficial to the community.</p><p>The data provide direct visualization of what had previously been a mostly hypothetical structure, the &quot;paternal cloud,&quot; using simultaneous labeling of paternal DNA and mitochondria in combination with a variety of maternal proteins including maternal mitochondria, yolk granules, tubulin, and plasma membrane. Together, these images provided convincing evidence of the existence of this specified cytoplasmic domain. They go on to show that the knockdown of the ataxin-2 homolog ALX-2, a protein previously shown to affect ER dynamics, disrupted the paternal cloud, identifying a role for ER organization in this structure.</p><p>The authors then used the system to test the functional consequences of perturbing the cytoplasmic organization. Consistent with the paternal cloud being a stable structure, it stayed intact during large movements the authors generated using previously published knockdowns (of mei-1/katanin and kinesin-13/kpl-7) that increased cytoplasmic streaming. They used this data to document instances in which the paternal chromosomes were likely to have been attached to the spindle. They concluded with direct evidence of spindle fibers connecting to the paternal chromatin upon knockdown of ATX-2 in combination with increased cytoplasmic streaming, providing strong, direct support for their overarching hypothesis.</p><p>Weaknesses</p><p>While the data is convincing, the narrative of the paper could be streamlined to highlight the novelty of the experiments and better articulate the aims. For example, the cloud of paternal mitochondria and membranous organelles was previously shown, but Figures 1-2 largely reiterate that observation. The innovation seems to be that the combination of ER, yolk, and maternal mitochondrial markers makes the existence of a specified domain more concrete. There are also some instances where more description is needed to make the conclusions from the images clear.</p></disp-quote><p>These general comments are addressed in the more specific critiques below.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>The manuscript intersperses what read like basic characterizations of fluorescent markers that, as written, can distract from the main story. The authors characterized the dynamics of ER organization throughout the substages of meiosis and the permeability of the envelope of ER that surrounds the paternal chromatin, but it could be more clearly established how the ability to visualize these structures allowed them to address their aims.</p></disp-quote><p>We have added the following after the initial description of ER morphology changes: (ER morphology was used to determine cell-cycle stages during live imaging reported below in Fig. 6.)</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>More background on what was previously known about ER organization in M-phase and the role of ataxin proteins specifically may help provide more continuity.</p></disp-quote><p>We have added references to transitions to ER sheets during mitotic M-phase in HeLa cells and <italic>Xenopus</italic> extracts.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p><bold>Reviewer #3 (Public Review):</bold></p><p>Summary:</p><p>This study by Beath et al. investigated the mechanisms by which sperm DNA is excluded from the meiotic spindle after fertilization. Time-lapse imaging revealed that sperm DNA is surrounded by paternal mitochondria and maternal ER that is permeable to proteins. By increasing cytoplasmic streaming using kinesin-13 or katanin RNAi, the authors demonstrated that limiting cytoplasmic streaming in the embryo is an important step that prevents the capture of sperm DNA by the oocyte meiotic spindle. Further experiments showed that the Ataxin-2 protein is required to hold paternal mitochondria together and close to the sperm DNA. Finally, double depletion of kinesin-13 and Ataxin-2 suggested an increased risk of meiotic spindle capture of sperm DNA.</p><p>Overall, this is an interesting finding that could provide a new understanding of how meiotic spindle capture of sperm DNA and its accidental expulsion into the polar body is prevented. However, some conceptual gaps need to be addressed and further experiments and improved data analyses would strengthen the paper.</p><p>- It would be helpful if the authors could discuss in good detail how they think maternal ER surrounds the sperm DNA</p></disp-quote><p>We have added 2 references to papers about nuclear envelope re-assembly from Shirin Bahmanyar’s lab and suggest the ER envelope is a halted intermediate in nuclear envelope reassembly.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>and why is it not disrupted following Ataxin disruption.</p></disp-quote><p>We have been attempting to disrupt ER structures in the meiotic embryo for the last 5 years by depleting profilin, BiP, atlastin, ATX-2 and by optogenetically packing ER into a ball in the middle of the oocyte. None of these treatments prevent envelopment of the sperm DNA by maternal ER. None of these treatments remove ER from the spindle envelope and none remove ER from the plasma membrane. These treatments mostly result in “large aggregates” of ER that we have not examined by EM. Wild speculation: any disruption of the ER strong enough to prevent ER envelopment around chromatin would be sterile because the M to S transition in the mitotic zone of the germline would be blocked. Rapid depletion of ATX-2 to the extent shown by rigorous data in this manuscript does not prevent ER envelopment around chromatin. We chose not to speculate about the reasons for this because we do not know why.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>- Since important phenotypes revealed in RNAi experiments (e.g. kinesin-13 and ataxin-2 double depletion) are not very robust, the authors should consider toning down their conclusions and revising some of their section headings. I appreciate that they are upfront about some limitations, but they do nonetheless make strong concluding sentences.</p></disp-quote><p>We have changed the discussion of the klp-7 atx-2 double depletion to: “The capture of the sperm DNA by the meiotic spindle in ATX-2 KLP-7 double depleted embryos suggests that the integrity of the exclusion zone around the sperm DNA might insulate the sperm DNA from spindle microtubules.

Perhaps rapid imaging of maternal mito-labeled kca-1(RNAi) embryos would better show the difference in time scale, with the expectation that the paternal cloud forms and persists while the ER invades.</p></disp-quote><p>We are not sure what the reviewer means. 5 sec time intervals were used throughout the paper. We are also not sure how kca-1(RNAi) would help. Movement of the entire oocyte into and out of the spermatheca is what limits the ability to keep a fusing sperm in focus. kca-1(RNAi) would prevent cytoplasmic streaming but not ovulation movements.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Figure 4 - The question about the permeability of the ER envelope seems to come out of nowhere as written. It isn't clear how it contributes to the larger story about preventing sperm incorporation in the spindle.</p></disp-quote><p>This section of the results is introduced with: “If the maternal ER envelope around sperm DNA was sealed and impermeable during meiosis, this could both prevent the sperm DNA from inducing ectopic spindle assembly and prevent the sperm DNA from interacting with meiotic spindle microtubules.”</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>The data in Figure 4 would probably not be expected to be in this paper based on the paper title. Maybe the title needs something about ER dynamics? &quot;eg. ATX-2 but not an ER envelope&quot; isolates the paternal chromatin?</p><p>In Figure 5, it seems that RNAi of klp-7 and Mei-1 had slightly different effects on short-axis displacement of the ER envelope (klp-7 affecting it more dramatically than mei-1) and slightly different effects on interaction with the meiotic spindle (capture vs streaming past the spindle). The authors mention in their discussion that the difference in the interaction with the meiotic spindle might reflect the effects that loss of Mei-1 may have on the spindle but could it also be a consequence of the differences in cytoplasmic streaming observed?</p></disp-quote><p>With our current data, the only statistically significant difference between cytoplasmic streaming of the sperm contents in mei-1(RNAi) vs klp-7(RNAi) is that excessive streaming persists longer into metaphase II in klp-7(RNAi). We have added a sentence describing this difference to the results. If differences in streaming were the cause of different capture frequencies, then klp-7(RNAi) would cause more capture events than mei-1(RNAi) but the opposite was observed. We have avoided too much discussion here because the frequency of capture events is too low to demonstrate statistically significant differences between mei-1(RNAi), klp-7(RNAi), and atx-2(degron) + klp-7(RNAi) without a very large increase in the number of time-lapse sequences.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Also, the authors should find a way to represent this interaction with the meiotic spindle in a quantitative or table form to allow the reader to observe some of the patterns they report more easily.</p></disp-quote><p>We have added a table to Fig. 9 that summarizes capture data.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Finally, can the authors report when they observe the closest association with the meiotic spindle: Does it correlate with the period of greatest displacement (AI) or are they unlinked?</p></disp-quote><p>The low frequency of capture events makes it difficult to test this rigorously.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Figure 6- 'Endogenously tagged ATX-2 was observed throughout oocytes and meiotic embryos without partial co-localization with ER.'

Moving the discussion of the displacement experiments in Figure S3 from the end of the results section to the ATX-2 knockdown section would help accomplish this.</p></disp-quote><p>We have added the sentence: “The frequency of sperm capture by the meiotic spindle (Fig. 9D) was significantly higher than wild-type controls in <italic>klp-7(RNAi) atx-2(AID)</italic> double depleted embryos (p=0.011 Fisher’s exact test). Although the number of single mutant embryos analyzed was too low to demonstrate a significant difference between single and double mutant embryos, these results qualitatively support the hypothesis that limiting cytoplasmic streaming and maintaining the integrity of the ball of paternal mitochondria are both important for preventing capture events between the meiotic spindle and sperm DNA.”</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>It looks like, in the double knockdown of ATX-2 and KLP-7, the spread of paternal mitochondria is less affected than when only ATX-2 is depleted. What effect does this result have on the observation that the incidence of sperm capture appears to increase in the double depletion? What does displacement of the ER ring look like in the double depletion? Is it additive, consistent with their interpretation that both limiting cytoplasmic streaming and maintaining the integrity of the ball of paternal mitochondria is required to keep the genomes separate?</p></disp-quote><p>We cannot show a significant difference between single a double knockdowns without increasing n by alot.

We have been attempting to disrupt ER structures in the meiotic embryo for the last 5 years by depleting profilin, BiP, atlastin, ATX-2 and by optogenetically packing ER into a ball in the middle of the oocyte. None of these treatments prevent envelopment of the sperm DNA by maternal ER. None of these treatments remove ER from the spindle envelope and none remove ER from the plasma membrane. These treatments mostly result in “large aggregates” of ER that we have not examined by EM. Wild speculation: any disruption of the ER strong enough to prevent ER envelopment around chromatin would be sterile because the M to S transition in the mitotic zone of the germline would be blocked. Rapid depletion of ATX-2 to the extent shown by rigorous data in this manuscript does not prevent ER envelopment around chromatin. We chose not to speculate about the reasons for this because we do not know why.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>It would be good to have representative images of what the altered spindle looks like in MEI-1-depleted oocytes.</p></disp-quote><p>The structure of MEI-1-depleted spindles has been described in the cited references.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>&quot;Depletion of MEI-1 or KLP-7 resulted in longer excursions of the sperm contents in the long axis of the embryo toward the spindle but frequent capture of the sperm by the spindle was only observed in mei-1(RNAi)&quot; - It is intriguing that this does not happen in the double depletion experiments of kinesin-13 and ATX-2.
