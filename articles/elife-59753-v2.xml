<italic>Poxviridae</italic> encode poxin enzymes that degrade the immune second messenger 2′3′-cGAMP to inhibit cGAS-STING immunity in mammalian cells. The closest homologs of poxin exist in the genomes of insect viruses suggesting a key mechanism of cGAS-STING evasion may have evolved outside of mammalian biology. Here we use a biochemical and structural approach to discover a broad family of 369 poxins encoded in diverse viral and animal genomes and define a prominent role for 2′3′-cGAMP cleavage in metazoan host-pathogen conflict. Structures of insect poxins reveal unexpected homology to flavivirus proteases and enable identification of functional self-cleaving poxins in RNA-virus polyproteins. Our data suggest widespread 2′3′-cGAMP signaling in insect antiviral immunity and explain how a family of cGAS-STING evasion enzymes evolved from viral proteases through gain of secondary nuclease activity. Poxin acquisition by poxviruses demonstrates the importance of environmental connections in shaping evolution of mammalian pathogens.</p></abstract><kwd-group kwd-group-type="author-keywords"><kwd>poxin</kwd><kwd>cGAMP</kwd><kwd>cGAS</kwd><kwd>STING</kwd><kwd>immune evasion</kwd><kwd>virology</kwd></kwd-group><kwd-group kwd-group-type="research-organism"><title>Research organism</title><kwd>None</kwd></kwd-group><funding-group><award-group id="fund1"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100001341</institution-id><institution>Richard and Susan Smith Family Foundation</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Kranzusch</surname><given-names>Philip J</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund2"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000884</institution-id><institution>Cancer Research Institute</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>Clinic and Laboratory Integration Program</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Kranzusch</surname><given-names>Philip J</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund3"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000875</institution-id><institution>Pew Charitable Trusts</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>Biomedical Scholars Program</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Kranzusch</surname><given-names>Philip J</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund4"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution>The Mark Foundation for Cancer Research</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>Emerging Leader Award</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Kranzusch</surname><given-names>Philip J</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund5"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution>The Parker Institute for Cancer Immunotherapy</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Kranzusch</surname><given-names>Philip J</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund6"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000002</institution-id><institution>National Institutes of Health</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>T32 Training Grant AI007245</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Eaglesham</surname><given-names>James B</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><funding-statement>The funders had no role in study design, data collection and interpretation, or the decision to submit the work for publication.</funding-statement></funding-group><custom-meta-group><custom-meta specific-use="meta-only"><meta-name>Author impact statement</meta-name><meta-value>Poxin enzymes are a diverse family of insect and viral 2′3′-cGAMP nucleases, which evolved from self-cleaving RNA virus accessory proteases.</meta-value></custom-meta></custom-meta-group></article-meta></front><body><sec id="s1" sec-type="intro"><title>Introduction</title><p>The cGAS-STING pathway is a major sensor of pathogen infection in mammalian cells where it functions to detect mislocalized cytosolic DNA exposed during infection (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Ablasser and Chen, 2019</xref>). The enzyme cyclic GMP–AMP synthase (cGAS) binds directly to cytosolic DNA, and becomes activated to synthesize the nucleotide second messenger 2′–5′/3′–5′ cyclic GMP–AMP (2′3′-cGAMP) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib53">Sun et al., 2013</xref>). 2′3′-cGAMP is then recognized by the receptor Stimulator of Interferon Genes (STING), which oligomerizes and recruits downstream signaling adapters to drive induction of type I interferon and NF-κB signaling (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1A</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Ablasser et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Diner et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Gao et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib62">Zhang et al., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib61">Zhang et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib63">Zhao et al., 2019</xref>).</p><fig-group><fig id="fig1" position="float"><label>Figure 1.</label><caption><title>Poxin 2′3′-cGAMP nuclease activity is conserved across three families of viruses and two orders of insects.</title><p>(<bold>A</bold>) Schematic of cGAS-STING signaling. The sensor cyclic GMP–AMP synthase (cGAS) detects cytosolic DNA and synthesizes the second messenger 2′3′-cGAMP from ATP and GTP. 2′3′-cGAMP activates the receptor Stimulator of Interferon Genes (STING) and initiates downstream antiviral signaling.

Poxviruses are large DNA viruses which replicate exclusively in the cytosol (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib41">Moss, 2013</xref>), and encode poxvirus immune nucleases (poxins) to degrade 2′3′-cGAMP and prevent STING activation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1A</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Eaglesham et al., 2019</xref>). Vaccinia virus (VACV) poxin (encoded by the gene <italic>B2R</italic>) is sufficient to antagonize cGAS-STING signaling in cells and is necessary for effective viral replication in vivo. Crystal structures of VACV poxin in the pre- and post-reactive states revealed that catalysis proceeds through a metal-independent mechanism, contorting 2′3′-cGAMP into a conformation that activates the 2′ hydroxyl for in-line cleavage of the 3′–5′ bond (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Eaglesham et al., 2019</xref>).</p><p>Poxviruses have a well-documented ability to acquire genes horizontally, especially from their hosts (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Hughes et al., 2010</xref>). The closest homologs of VACV poxin belong not to mammals or other mammalian viruses, but to baculoviruses, and Lepidoptera (moths and butterflies) which serve as exclusive hosts of baculoviruses (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Eaglesham et al., 2019</xref>). While baculovirus and lepidopteran poxin homologs share &lt;25% identity with VACV poxin, they are functional nucleases and retain 2′3′-cGAMP-specific cleavage activity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Eaglesham et al., 2019</xref>). The distribution of poxin homologs in mammalian poxviruses, insects, and insect viruses indicates that poxviruses may have obtained this gene through horizontal transfer from an ancestral host-pathogen conflict.</p><p>Here we use a forward biochemical approach to map the evolutionary origin of poxin enzymes and define a genetic route through which poxviruses acquired a new mechanism of immune evasion. We determine four X-ray crystal structures of baculovirus and lepidopteran host poxins, revealing an unexpected origin of poxin enzymes as descendants of viral proteases. The structures of the cabbage looper moth <italic>Trichoplusia ni</italic>, and monarch butterfly <italic>Danaus plexippus</italic> poxin enzymes resemble self-cleaving proteases from positive-sense single-stranded RNA ((+)ssRNA) viruses, and bind their own C-termini within a vestigial protease active-site pocket. Using the lepidopteran poxin structures as a guide, we identify functional poxin enzymes in the genomes of unclassified insect-specific RNA viruses distantly related to flaviviruses, which possess both 2′3′-cGAMP nuclease activity and auto-proteolytic cleavage activity. Our results define broad importance for 2′3′-cGAMP cleavage in metazoan host-pathogen conflict and reveal an evolutionary path through which an insect RNA viral protease developed secondary nuclease activity to inhibit cGAS-STING immunity. Conservation of poxin cGAS-STING evasion among pathogens like monkeypox virus and cowpox virus highlights a deep genetic connection which allowed these mammalian poxviruses to obtain a new mechanism of immune evasion from the environment.</p></sec><sec id="s2" sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><sec id="s2-1"><title>Poxins are a diverse family of 2′3′-cGAMP nucleases</title><p>To define poxin diversity and phylogenetic distribution, we used both the VACV poxin and lepidopteran <italic>Trichoplusia ni</italic> poxin sequences to seed position-specific iterative BLAST (PSI-BLAST) searches, identifying an initial combined total of 351 unique poxin-like sequences. Poxin homologs can be classified into four major enzyme groups with &lt;25% identity to one another and which share seven different phylogenetic origins (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1B</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1A</xref>). We cloned 33 diverse representatives and directly tested recombinant protein for 2′3′-cGAMP nuclease activity using thin-layer chromatography (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1B</xref>). Poxin homologs from all groups efficiently degraded 2′3′-cGAMP (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1B</xref>), demonstrating nuclease activity is a conserved function of this protein family regardless of the sequence origin or genomic context.</p><p>The presence of active poxin homologs within each major group demonstrates widespread distribution of an enzyme family dedicated to regulation and evasion of cGAS-STING signaling. Poxins are encoded in a diverse array of viruses and host animal species (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1B</xref>, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="supp1">Supplementary file 1</xref>). Group one is composed of enzymes from mammalian and insect poxviruses, some of which are fused to a C-terminal schlafen domain (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Eaglesham et al., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">Liu et al., 2018a</xref>). Groups 2–4 consist entirely of enzymes identified in the genomes of moths and butterflies (Lepidoptera), and viruses or parasites which infect these insects. Group two primarily contains poxins encoded in alphabaculovirus genomes. However, two sequences identified in the genomes of parasitoid wasps (<italic>Microplitis demolitor</italic> and <italic>Glypta fumiferanae</italic>) cluster alongside these viral enzymes. These wasps parasitize caterpillars, laying their eggs inside them and co-injecting domesticated bracoviruses which modulate caterpillar immunity to favor egg maturation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Béliveau et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Burke et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib52">Strand and Burke, 2015</xref>). Lepidopteran poxin enzymes cluster within Group 3, and have been shown to be highly upregulated after infection with various pathogens, including alphabaculoviruses and bacteria, providing evidence for a role in immunity or immune regulation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib50">Shrestha et al., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib60">Woon Shin et al., 1998</xref>). Group four is formed by poxin proteins from the genomes of several additional lepidopteran viruses: betabaculoviruses (also called granuloviruses), cypoviruses (double-stranded RNA viruses in the family <italic>Reoviridae</italic>), and betaentomopoxviruses (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1B</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib51">Silva et al., 2020</xref>). The vast evolutionary distance between these DNA and RNA viral families suggests related poxin genes may have been transferred between viruses within coinfected cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib51">Silva et al., 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib56">Thézé et al., 2015</xref>). Notably, the enormous diversity of poxin enzymes in insect pathogens and moth and butterfly genomes confirms a broad role for 2′3′-cGAMP degradation, and strongly suggests these genomes served as a source for emergence of poxins in mammalian poxviruses.</p></sec><sec id="s2-2"><title>Host and viral poxins employ alternative catalytic residues for 2′3′-cGAMP cleavage</title><p>Poxin enzymes from different groups share at most 15–25% identity, preventing identification of active-site residues and limiting analysis of the mechanism of 2′3′-cGAMP cleavage. To enable comparative analysis with VACV poxin (Group 1), we next determined a series of structures of representative enzymes from Groups 2–4 in complex with 2′3′-cGAMP. New poxin structures include the alphabaculovirus <italic>Autographa californica</italic> nucleopolyhedrovirus (AcNPV) poxin from Group 2, lepidopteran host poxins from the moth <italic>Trichoplusia ni</italic> and the monarch butterfly <italic>Danaus plexippus</italic> in Group 3, and the betabaculovirus <italic>Pieris rapae</italic> granulovirus (PrGV) poxin from Group 4 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2A</xref>, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="supp2">Supplementary file 2</xref>).

Unlike the catalytic triad of histidine, tyrosine, and lysine residues essential for VACV and AcNPV poxin cleavage activity (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2B,C</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s1">Figure 2—figure supplement 1B,C</xref>), the active sites of <italic>T. ni</italic> poxin and PrGV poxin are divergent. The <italic>T. ni</italic> and PrGV poxin enzymes share the conserved active-site histidine but lack a tyrosine residue entirely (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2D,E</xref>). Instead, both proteins contain a second histidine residue adjacent to the first, which forms a contact with the 2′ hydroxyl or 3′ phosphate of the cleaved 2′3′-cGAMP molecule (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2D,E</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s1">Figure 2—figure supplement 1C</xref>). In the case of <italic>T. ni</italic> poxin, mutagenesis analysis demonstrates this second histidine residue is essential for activity, suggesting this residue functions as a general base to deprotonate and activate the 2′ hydroxyl nucleophile for in-line cleavage of the 3′–5′ bond (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s1">Figure 2—figure supplement 1B</xref>). Further, the <italic>T. ni</italic> poxin protein shows substitution of the VACV lysine for an arginine residue, whereas the lysine is conserved in PrGV poxin (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2D,E</xref>). Unlike mutation of the lysine residue in the VACV and AcNPV active sites, mutation of the <italic>T. ni</italic> poxin active-site arginine to alanine only partially reduces activity, and a charge-preserving mutation of the arginine to lysine results in even less activity (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s1">Figure 2—figure supplement 1B</xref>). Together, these results reveal amino-acid diversity in the active-site of poxin enzymes and suggest functional differences in the ability to control 2′3′-cGAMP stability.</p><p>To study potential functional variation between viral and host poxins, we measured kinetics for VACV, AcNPV, and <italic>T. ni</italic> poxin 2′3′-cGAMP degradation.

However, the host <italic>T. ni</italic> poxin has a much higher rate constant of 2254 min<sup>−1</sup> compared to VACV and AcNPV poxin (93.4 min<sup>−1</sup> and 346 min<sup>−1</sup>, respectively). For comparison, we determined the <italic>K<sub>D</sub></italic> of VACV, AcNPV, and <italic>T. ni</italic> poxin for 2ʹ3ʹ-cGAMP using enzymes with an inactivating catalytic site histidine mutation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s2">Figure 2—figure supplement 2E–H</xref>).

These enzymes represent only three members of a highly divergent enzyme family, and additional analyses will be required to determine whether these trends in enzyme kinetics hold true for other viral and host poxin enzymes.</p><p>Although animal studies will be required to understand the biological role of diverse poxins, our biochemical analysis is consistent with a model where viral poxins are adapted to depletion of 2′3′-cGAMP to low levels, while the host poxin is adapted for regulation and efficient clearance of 2′3′-cGAMP after accumulation to higher concentrations. Further supporting these results, studies of the lepidopteran transcriptional response to baculovirus infection show that host poxin genes are strongly upregulated during infection in a second wave of transcription occurring after initial immune induction (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib50">Shrestha et al., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib60">Woon Shin et al., 1998</xref>). Together, these results reveal that while all poxin enzymes use the same overall mechanism, amino-acid diversity in the active site of poxin enzymes likely enables 2′3′-cGAMP nuclease activity to be tailored to alternative immuno-regulatory and immuno-evasion functions (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s2">Figure 2—figure supplement 2</xref>).</p></sec><sec id="s2-3"><title>Structural analysis reveals poxins are descended from self-cleaving RNA-virus proteases</title><p>To define the origin of poxin enzymes, we next compared each nuclease against other structures in the Protein Data Bank to identify proteins with related folds.

The currently available poxin enzyme sequences form nine groups or subgroups based on phylogenetic analysis and species origin. Of note, amarillovirus poxin sequences in Group five and baculovirus poxin sequences in Group 2C do not achieve &gt;50% bootstrap support. As new sequences become available, future bioinformatic work will be required to reconstruct the exact mechanism of poxin horizontal spread, and to confirm RNA viruses as the progenitors of all poxin enzymes. Our phylogenetic analysis further emphasizes that nearly all insect viruses which encode a poxin enzyme exclusively infect moths and butterflies in the order Lepidoptera. As lepidopteran hosts also encode endogenized versions of poxin, our results reveal moths and butterflies and their pathogens as an epicenter for extensive radiation of this protein family. The most divergent poxin enzyme sequences are encoded in the genomes of (+)ssRNA viruses from the order <italic>Amarillovirales</italic>, distantly related to mammalian (+)ssRNA pathogens like dengue virus and hepatitis C virus. Identification of functional self-cleaving poxin enzymes with 2′3′-cGAMP nuclease activity in circulating amarilloviruses provides further support for the biochemical model of evolution of poxin enzymes from (+)ssRNA viral proteases. Horizontal transfer from an ancient amarillovirus likely seeded poxin diversification in Lepidoptera and eventual acquisition by mammalian poxviruses. Amarillovirus genomes encoding poxin have been identified in geographically distant locations and from extremely diverse insect species representing six different phylogenetic orders (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Faizah et al., 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Kobayashi et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Kondo et al., 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib45">Remnant et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib49">Shi et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib54">Teixeira et al., 2016</xref>). As our understanding of viral diversity continues to broaden, it is likely that additional immune evasion mechanisms will be identified as shared between mammalian viruses and invertebrate pathogens.</p><p>In mammals, poxin functions to degrade 2′3′-cGAMP and block induction of antiviral signaling by the cGAS-STING pathway during poxvirus infection (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Eaglesham et al., 2019</xref>). In most mammalian poxviruses, poxin exists as a fusion to a C-terminal domain with homology to mammalian schlafens (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Eaglesham et al., 2019</xref>). Recent work with ectromelia virus demonstrates the schlafen domain is dispensable for evasion of cGAS-STING signaling, and that mammalian schlafens fail to complement poxin–schlafen deletion mutant viruses (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Hernáez et al., 2020</xref>). Given conservation of the poxin–schlafen fusion amongst most orthopoxviruses (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Eaglesham et al., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Hernáez et al., 2020</xref>), further work is required to explore auxiliary roles for the schlafen domain in cGAS-STING regulation by poxin.</p><p>The widespread distribution of poxin enzymes in insect viruses supports a prominent role for 2′3′-cGAMP-signaling in metazoan antiviral immunity. Recent studies of cGAS-STING signaling in insects have demonstrated that <italic>Drosophila</italic> STING drives NF-κB and autophagy signaling to restrict viral infection (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Goto et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Gui et al., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Hua et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">Liu et al., 2018b</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">Martin et al., 2018</xref>). However, the upstream signaling machinery that activates STING in insects remains poorly understood. Insects encode enzymes like <italic>Drosophila melanogaster</italic> CG7194 and CG12970 that are part of the cGAS/DncV-like nucleotidyltransferase (CD-NTase) family (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">Kranzusch, 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib59">Whiteley et al., 2019</xref>), but these enzymes are significantly divergent from mammalian cGAS and it is unclear if insect CD-NTases synthesize 2′3′-cGAMP or respond to cytosolic DNA. Our results show that nearly all poxin representatives from across all groups retain specificity for 2′3′-cGAMP and fail to cleave 3′3′-cGAMP. Although exceptions to poxin specificity exist (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5s2">Figure 5—figure supplement 2B</xref>), these results suggest that 2′3′-cGAMP is a predominant ligand in insect immune signaling.</p><p>While most metazoan poxin enzymes were identified in the genomes of moths and butterflies, several examples suggest that poxins play an important role in immunity in diverse insects. Two different parasitoid wasp species encode poxin homologs (<italic>Glypta fumiferanae</italic>: AKD28026 and <italic>Microplitis demolitor</italic>: XP_008552911), and previous work suggests these proteins may even play a role in parasitism of caterpillars, within which the wasps lay their eggs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Béliveau et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Burke et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib52">Strand and Burke, 2015</xref>). Further, the mayfly <italic>Ephemera danica</italic> encodes a poxin homolog (KAF4524375), which possesses an intact HYK catalytic triad indicating functional poxin nuclease activity, but this enzyme fails to cluster within other poxin groups (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6A</xref>). Future studies of these, and other insect poxin proteins will provide further insight into the ancient evolutionary relationship between RNA-virus proteases and poxin nucleases.</p><p>Whereas insect viral poxins likely restrict immune activation similar to the function of poxin in mammalian poxviruses, the biological roles of poxin enzymes endogenized in the genomes of insects are less clear. One hypothesis is that insect poxins function to limit the magnitude of STING activation. In agreement, our results suggest that host insect poxins function with kinetics distinct from viral poxin counterparts (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s2">Figure 2—figure supplement 2</xref>). Although viral poxins are capable of degrading 2′3′-cGAMP even at low ligand concentrations, host poxins instead appear tailored for setting an upper threshold for the immune response. In mammals, a growing body of work suggests that 2′3′-cGAMP can be released from infected cells and imported to activate bystander immunity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Carozza et al., 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">Luteijn et al., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib47">Ritchie et al., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib65">Zhou et al., 2020</xref>). Interestingly, our bioinformatic analysis demonstrates that many baculoviruses encode two different poxin enzymes with one variant containing a signal peptide for extracellular secretion (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6A</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Craveiro et al., 2015</xref>). Likewise, host lepidopteran poxins are encoded as multiple isoforms with and without a signal peptides (e.g. <italic>Trichoplusia ni</italic> XP_026730193 and XP_026730202) (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="supp1">Supplementary file 1</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Chen et al., 2019</xref>). In insects, poxins may therefore regulate extracellular 2′3′-cGAMP signaling in addition to controlling cytosolic cGAS-STING activation.</p><p>In contrast to the widespread distribution of poxin enzymes among insects and insect viruses, there is a puzzling lack of cytosolic 2′3′-cGAMP nuclease machinery in mammalian cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Eaglesham et al., 2019</xref>). The only enzyme known to degrade 2′3′-cGAMP in humans is the nuclease ENPP1, which is exclusively extracellular and regulates signaling outside of the cell (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Carozza et al., 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Li et al., 2014</xref>). Functional homologs of ENPP1 have not been identified in insects, indicating that alternative mechanisms for regulating cGAS-STING signaling may exist in these animals. Our data indicate that insect poxins may be expressed as both secreted and cytosolic forms, perhaps having functional roles in both intra- and extracellular cGAS-STING regulation. This abundance of enzymes that efficiently degrade 2′3′-cGAMP in the cytosol of insects may have provided the opportunity for poxviruses to acquire a new mechanism of immune control that did not exist in mammalian cells. Poxins have traversed a vast evolutionary distance from an origin in insect (+)ssRNA viruses to a role in enabling mammalian poxvirus pathogens to evade cGAS-STING immunity, and a remarkable transition from protease to nuclease activity provides a clear example of how proteins can evolve through gain and loss of enzymatic function. Acquisition of poxins from insect viruses further underscores the functional similarities between mammalian and insect innate immunity and reveals the importance of environmental genetic diversity as a driver for evolution of pathogenic viruses.</p></sec><sec id="s4" sec-type="materials|methods"><title>Materials and methods</title><sec id="s4-1"><title>Bioinformatic identification and cloning of poxin homologs</title><p>VACV poxin and the host lepidopteran <italic>T. ni</italic> poxin sequences were used to initiate queries of the NCBI nonredundant protein database using position-specific iterative BLAST (PSI-BLAST) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Altschul et al., 1997</xref>) on January 17, 2020.

Therefore, these boundaries were applied to each amarillovirus poxin sequence to adjust for the wide variety of sequence lengths identified by PSI-BLAST. For Lepidoptera, a single isoform of each poxin protein was included in the alignment used to generate the tree. In poxviruses, many representatives of poxin are encoded as C-terminal fusions to a domain with homology to mammalian schlafen proteins.

Chemically-synthesized 2′3′-cGAMP was then re-suspended in water, and labeled by addition of [<sup>32</sup>P]−2′3′-cGAMP tracer at a 1:50 dilution to achieve radioactively labeled stocks at a range of concentrations. 10 µl reactions were assembled in triplicate in 8-well strips with one well serving as a tracer-only background control, and seven wells serving as experimental poxin degradation reactions with varying concentrations of substrate. Reactions were pre-warmed to 37°C in a 96-well heat block for 5 min prior to addition of 1 µl of buffer to the tracer-only background control and 1 µl of poxin protein to the experimental wells. Reactions were mixed with a multi-channel pipettor, and stopped by spotting directly onto a TLC plate after 30 s. VACV poxin reactions were carried out with 20 nM protein (10 nM enzyme dimer) incubated with 2′3′-cGAMP at the following final concentrations: 0.1, 0.25, 0.5, 0.75, 1, 2.5, and 5 µM. AcNPV poxin reactions were carried out with 20 nM protein (10 nM enzyme dimer) incubated with 2′3′-cGAMP at the following final concentrations: 0.25, 0.5, 0.75, 1, 2.5, 5, and 10 µM. <italic>T. ni</italic> poxin reactions were carried out with 100 nM protein (50 nM enzyme dimer) incubated with 2′3′-cGAMP at the following final concentrations: 50, 100, 150, 250, 500, 750, and 1 mM. Reaction progress was monitored using thin-layer chromatography, and quantified using ImageQuant software (GE). Percentage 2′3′-cGAMP turnover was calculated by quantification of the cleaved 2′3′-cGAMP spot intensity divided by the total signal for cleaved and uncleaved 2′3′-cGAMP in each lane. This value was then adjusted by subtraction of the percentage turnover value observed for the tracer-only negative control. To obtain the initial rates of 2′3′-cGAMP degradation in µM min<sup>−1</sup>, adjusted percent turnover was multiplied by the total concentration of 2′3′-cGAMP in each reaction, and divided by the length of the reaction (0.5 min). 2′3′-cGAMP dependent enzyme kinetics were fit using the Michaelis-Menten model in GraphPad Prism, and <italic>K<sub>cat</sub></italic> values were determined using the concentrations of poxin dimer, the minimal active enzyme unit. Results for each enzyme shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s2">Figure 2—figure supplement 2</xref> are a single experiment (n = 3 technical replicates), representative of at least two biological replicates.</p></sec><sec id="s4-7"><title>Electrophoretic mobility shift assay</title><p>Stable poxin–2′3′-cGAMP complex formation was assessed using an electrophoretic mobility shift assay as previously developed for the receptor STING (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib40">Morehouse et al., 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib59">Whiteley et al., 2019</xref>). All 2′3′-cGAMP-binding experiments were performed with catalytic inactive poxin mutants VACV poxin H17A, AcNPV poxin H46A, and <italic>T. ni</italic> poxin H56A to prevent cleavage. Briefly, radiolabeled 2′3′-cGAMP was diluted to a final concentration of ~50 nM into 10 μl reactions containing 1 × reaction buffer (50 mM KCl, 50 mM Tris-HCl pH 7.5, and 1 mM TCEP) and 0–20 μM recombinant poxin protein as indicated. Reactions were incubated for 30 min at 25°C, then separated on a 7.2 cm 6% nondenaturing polyacrylamide gel run at 100 V for 45 min in 0.5 × TBE buffer. The gel was fixed for 15 min in a solution of 40% ethanol and 10% acetic acid before drying at 80°C for 1 hr and then exposed to a phosphor screen and imaged with a Typhoon Trio Variable Mode Imager (GE Healthcare). Signal intensity was quantified using ImageQuant 5.2 software (GE Healthcare) and analyzed in GraphPad Prism 8.4.3 using the specific binding with hill slope model to determine <italic>K<sub>D</sub></italic>. Note that use of proteins with catalytically inactivating mutations likely results in an underestimated <italic>K<sub>D</sub></italic> value for each poxin studied.</p></sec><sec id="s4-8"><title>Crystallization and structure determination</title><p>Crystals of AcNPV, PrGV, <italic>T. ni</italic> and <italic>D. plexippus</italic> poxin proteins were grown using hanging-drop vapor diffusion at 18°C. AcNPV, PrGV, and <italic>T. ni</italic> poxin proteins were crystallized at a concentration of 7 mg ml<sup>−1</sup> in the presence of 2.5–5 mM 2′3′-cGAMP, yielding post-reactive structures bound to a cleaved Gp[2′–5′]Ap[3′] molecule. <italic>D. plexippus</italic> poxin protein crystals were grown at 7 mg ml<sup>−1</sup> in the presence of 300 µM phosphorothioate nonhydrolyzable 2′3′-cGAMP Isomer 2 (Biolog), but failed to crystallize in complex with this nucleotide, instead yielding an apo structure. SeMet-labeled and native AcNPV poxin crystals grew in 100 mM sodium acetate pH 4.8–5.2, 35–39% PEG-400 and were cryoprotected in mother liquor. SeMet-substituted and native PrGV poxin crystals grew in 200 mM MgCl<sub>2</sub>, 100 mM Tris-Cl pH 8.3–8.7, 21–25% PEG-3350, and were cryoprotected with mother liquor supplemented with 15% ethylene glycol. SeMet-substituted <italic>D. plexippus</italic> poxin crystals were grown in 200–250 mM calcium acetate, 17–21% PEG-3350, and cryoprotected in NVH oil. <italic>D. plexippus</italic> native crystals grew in 200 mM ammonium citrate, 25% PEG-3350. Native <italic>T. ni</italic> poxin crystals were grown in 100 mM HEPES-KOH pH 8.0, 32% Jeffamine ED-2001, and frozen without cryoprotection. X-ray diffraction data were collected at the Advanced Photon Source beamlines 24-ID-C and 24-ID-E.</p><p>X-ray crystallography data were processed with XDS and AIMLESS (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Kabsch, 2010</xref>), using the SSRL autoxds script (A. Gonzales, Stanford SSRL). Experimental phase information for AcNPV, PrGV, and <italic>D. plexippus</italic> poxin proteins was determined using data collected from SeMet-substituted crystals. For SeMet-labeled AcNPV poxin, PrGV poxin, and <italic>D. plexippus</italic> poxin, heavy sites were identified using HySS in Phaser (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Adams et al., 2010</xref>), initial maps were produced using SOLVE/RESOLVE (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib55">Terwilliger, 1999</xref>), followed by model-building in Coot (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Emsley and Cowtan, 2004</xref>). For AcNPV poxin, a phase solution could only be found using data processed into the space group I4<sub>1</sub>, with 20 sites identified using HySS. Following initial manual building in Coot, a partial unrefined model was used as a molecular replacement search which obtained a solution in the spacegroup P1 with 16 AcNPV poxin copies in the asymmetric unit arranged as a double-helical filament. Analysis of data pathologies after processing into the space group P1 using Xtriage within PHENIX showed a multivariate Z-score of 5.243, indicating twinning, and successful refinement was carried out in PHENIX with the twin operator -l,-h,h+k+l. Using SeMet-labeled PrGV poxin crystals, eight sites were identified using HySS, and an initial map was calculated as above followed by model-building and refinement in PHENIX. For <italic>D. plexippus</italic> poxin, HySS detected 10 sites, allowing calculation of an initial map, model-building in coot, and refinement in PHENIX. The <italic>D. plexippus</italic> poxin structure was subsequently used as a molecular replacement search model to determine an initial map of the related <italic>T. ni</italic> poxin (50% identical), followed by model-building in coot and refinement in PHENIX. All structure figures were rendered using PyMOL (version 2.3.3).</p></sec><sec id="s4-9"><title>Dali structural homology analysis</title><p>In order to compare poxin structural homology to proteins in the Protein Data Bank, poxin monomer structures were uploaded and used to query the DALI server (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Holm, 2019</xref>). Z-scores for homologs less than 90% identical to one another (PDB90) were then plotted using GraphPad prism to compare the distribution and overall level of homology detectable between each poxin structure and proteins in the Protein Data Bank (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3A,B</xref>). Hits identified for each poxin protein in the PDB were sorted into ‘protease’ or ‘other’ groups using a PDB advanced search. The search was constructed by searching for overlaps between PDB IDs identified with DALI for each poxin with those identified using the following terms: Enzyme classification names equaling ‘Serine endopeptidases’ or ‘Cysteine endopeptidases’ or ‘trypsin’ or ‘chymotrypsin’ or ‘enteropeptidase’, OR Annotation name – CATH equaling ‘trypsin-like serine proteases’, OR Structure title containing phrases ‘protease’, or ‘Peptidase’, OR Macromolecule name containing phrases ‘protease’, or ‘peptidase’, OR annotation identifier – CATH equaling ‘2.40.10.120’. In order to compare the level of homology between <italic>T. ni</italic> poxin and eukaryotic or viral proteases by phylogenetic group, a list of the homolog PDB codes returned by DALI after query with <italic>T. ni</italic> poxin were used to perform a Protein Data Bank advanced search, and filtered by phylogeny as stated in the figure (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3B</xref>). PDB codes assigned to these phylogenetic groups were then plotted using GraphPad prism to compare the global level of homology between <italic>T. ni</italic> poxin and proteases from different groups (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3B</xref>). VACV poxin was the top hit in all DALI searches with new poxin structures with a Z-score of 18.1 for AcNPV, 15.7 for PrGV, and 16.9 for <italic>T. ni</italic>, but was excluded to allow analysis for distant protease homology.</p></sec><sec id="s4-10"><title>Edman degradation</title><p>C-terminally 6 × His tagged GFP fragments resulting from amarillovirus poxin self-cleavage were subjected to Edman degradation for cleavage site identification. GFP fragments were produced at large-scale and purified using Ni-NTA and S75 size-exclusion chromatography as described above. The cleaved GFP fragments were then resolved on a 15% SDS-PAGE gel, transferred to a PVDF membrane (Bio-Rad), and stained with Coomasie G-250 (VWR). Bands corresponding to the cleaved proteins were excised from the membrane and submitted for five cycles of Edman Degradation at the Tufts University Core Facility. The resulting assignments were made by the facility: SLV2 (S, T, P, R, R), XCV (S,T, No Call, S, K), both of which corresponded exactly to only one site within the SLV2 and XCV GFP fusion constructs used, marked in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5F</xref>.</p></sec></sec></body><back><ack id="ack"><title>Acknowledgements</title><p>The authors acknowledge R Eaglesham, A Lee, K Chat, and members of the Kranzusch lab for helpful comments and discussion.

They use homology searches, phylogenetic analysis, biochemistry, and structural biology to build a case for the evolutionary history for poxin emergence in viruses of insects, insects, and poxviruses. They propose 4 classes of poxins and present an intriguing model for the history of poxin origins from self-cleaving proteases to become nucleases of 2'3'-cGAMP.</p><p>The combination of approaches nicely advances the earlier discovery of poxins and in addition to providing important new details about both inhibition (viruses) and regulation (insects) of cGAS through nuclease activity, the work also shows how combined biochem/evolution analysis can reveal otherwise cryptic relationships between highly diverged enzymes. Some of the phylogenetic analysis might be improved to give a better sense of the robustness of relationships between poxin variants given the massive divergence among the proteins.</p><p>1) The phylogenetic analysis appears to exclusively use neighbor-joining methodology and lacks bootstrap analysis, two potential shortcomings in gaining a robust view of the evolutionary relationships among poxin and poxin-related sequences. The analysis would be greatly improved by at least one other approach (for example a maximum-likelihood method like the one implemented in PhyML) as well as bootstrap analysis with values reported at least at the major nodes proposed to classify and sub-classify into 4 groups. Based on Figure 1 how did the authors decide to propose 4 clades versus for example 3 or 5?</p><p>2) A model for a single origin of poxins from self-cleaving proteases is presented. However, in Figure 6, the amarillovirus poxins, although all labeled in brown, appear in two groups, with one of them more closely related to poxvirus poxins. If the topology is correct (see point 1) this supports a model where poxviruses independently acquired the ancestral poxin compared to the insects/insect viruses. A closer examination of the phylogenetic relationships and the differences in amarillovirus poxins is warranted. On a related note, do the authors have ideas on poxin differences in poxviruses, for example the addition of a schlafen domain.</p><p><italic>Reviewer 2:</italic></p><p>Eaglesham et al. use a biochemical and structural approach to describe the evolutionary history of a family of enzymes known as poxins, which function as 2'3'-cGAMP nucleases. The authors first identify diverse poxin homologs in virus and metazoan species and provide structural and functional evidence of shared 2'3'-cGAMP nuclease activity despite low sequence similarity across clades. Using structural homology searches, the authors identify even more distantly related shared structural elements between the N-terminus protease domain of insect poxins and proteases from +ssRNA viruses. To confirm their hypothesis that poxins are evolutionarily related to self-cleaving +ssRNA viral proteases, they compare the crystal structures of +ssRNA viral protease and lepidopteran poxin and identify vestigial self-cleaving protease active sites that are broadly conserved across Lepidoptera. They further show that members of +ssRNA flavivirus-like viruses from the <italic>Amarillovirales</italic> order encode active poxin nucleases that possess self-cleaving protease ability. Finally, the authors provide a possible evolutionary trajectory for poxins and suggest poxins arose from ancestral +ssRNA viral proteases, acquired secondary nuclease activity, and spread via horizontal gene transfer into diverse viral and insect genomes.</p><p>Overall, this is a very interesting and well written manuscript. The conclusions are well supported by their data and are impactful. Some areas of concern that would improve the manuscript are below:</p><p>1) Based on the data provided in Figure 2—figure supplement 2, the authors propose that viral enzymes have evolved to have higher binding affinity for cGAMP than host enzymes. However, they are concluding this based on kinetic measurements of only two viral enzymes and only one host enzyme. Could the authors provide kinetic data for a member of clade 4 (viral) and/or a Hymenoptera member of clade 2 (presumably &quot;host&quot;) to further support his claim?</p><p>2) In Figure 6, the authors use a neighbor-joining algorithm to generate phylogenetic trees that they then use to infer deep ancestral relationships of these diverse enzymes. It would be better to use maximum likelihood or Bayesian algorithms to generate these trees, as these approaches are better at resolving deep branches in trees.</p><p>3) Also in Figure 6, the authors speculate that an ancestral duplication of the viral protease led to the dual-function protease/poxin domains found in amarilloviruses. However, many viral genomes have proteases that are unrelated to each other and are instead distinct folds, etc. Are the N-terminal protease/poxin domain and the other protease in these genomes obviously related to each other? If not, the model should be more agnostic in terms of the exact origin of the protease/poxin domain.</p><p>4) The authors state in the Discussion that their data suggest that 2'3'-cGAMP is a predominant ligand in insect immune signaling. Have they shown that these divergent poxins, especially those from amarilloviruses, can exclusively hydrolyze 2'3'-cGAMP?</p></body></sub-article><sub-article article-type="reply" id="sa2"><front-stub><article-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.59753.sa2</article-id><title-group><article-title>Author response</article-title></title-group></front-stub><body><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>[…] Two main areas of shared concern emerged in the review that need to be addressed for the manuscript to be published.</p><p>First, additional phylogenetic work should be conducted using maximum-likelihood and/or bayesian approaches, which also includes bootstrapping analysis to give a better sense of how robust the relationships are between sequences, as noted in some form by all three reviewers and are reflected in the major points attached to the letter.</p></disp-quote><p>We have performed the new phylogenetic analysis as requested, using a maximum-likelihood approach with bootstrapping, and Figure 6 has been updated with the resulting tree. Additional data regarding this analysis are available in Figure 6—figure supplement 1. This analysis further confirms nearly all groups of poxin enzymes proposed in the manuscript but shows that deep relationships between poxin enzymes cannot be fully resolved using the set of sequences currently available. While the inner branches of the poxin phylogeny remain unresolved, our biochemical and structural analysis of poxin proteins provides strong support for our model that these proteins originated as self-cleaving proteases in RNA virus genomes. As additional poxin sequences become available, we anticipate that our study will enable future bioinformatic analyses to resolve the deepest relationships between poxins and provide a more detailed explanation for the phylogenetic distribution of this protein family across different viruses and animal species.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Second, the authors should consider reviewer comments related to the inhibition/regulation models of poxin and poxin-like activity in viruses and hosts.

As outlined below, we have addressed these points with new results including cyclic dinucleotide cleavage experiments to assess specificity of diverse poxin enzymes, protease experiments to further define amarillovirus poxin protease activity, and electrophoretic mobility shift assay experiments to directly measure 2′3′-cGAMP binding for VACV, AcNPV, and <italic>T. ni</italic> poxin proteins.

We have extended our phylogenetic analysis to include a maximum-likelihood tree of diverse poxin sequences with bootstrap analysis as requested. These results provide strong bootstrap support for almost all clades proposed in the original manuscript, including clade 4 which is composed of enzymes from multiple groups of insect viruses. However, because not every proposed clade is well-supported with bootstrap value &gt;50%, we have made changes to our manuscript for clarity. We now use the word “group” in place of the word “clade” to classify poxin enzymes, in order to emphasize that we are unable to confirm that each group is monophyletic, and to indicate that groups have been defined using both phylogenetic information and based on their species-origin. While most groups do constitute monophyletic clades, sufficient support is not achieved to designate monophyly of certain groups (Group 6: Amarillovirus poxins, and Group 2C: Baculovirus poxins). The amarillovirus poxins in Group 6 are of particular interest in the context of our biochemical and structural data. However, the comparatively small number of sequences available for this group, combined with the great divergence among amarillovirus poxins and their poorly defined N- and C-terminal boundaries, limit robust phylogenetic analysis and demonstrate the importance of our experimental approach in resolving deep evolutionary relationships.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>2) A model for a single origin of poxins from self-cleaving proteases is presented.

Our maximum-likelihood analysis shows that the relationships between amarillovirus poxins and other groups like poxviruses cannot be resolved with enough certainty to provide a detailed model for how different groups of poxins acquired the ancestral enzyme from RNA viruses. As additional amarillovirus genomes are sequenced, we anticipate that these relationships will become clearer.</p><p>We agree that poxin–schlafen fusions in mammalian poxviruses are particularly interesting. Recent work by Hernaez et al., 2020, provides additional interesting analysis of the poxin–schlafen fusion in vivo using ectromelia (mousepox) virus. Their work shows that the poxin domain is critical for subversion of cGAS-STING immunity and for ectromelia virus virulence, and expression of the schlafen domain alone fails to allow viral immune evasion. Further, they show that mammalian schlafen homologs fail to complement a deletion mutant virus lacking the poxin–schlafen fusion. While their study and our work has thus far not elucidated a role for the schlafen domain, its conservation amongst orthopoxviruses as a fusion to poxin strongly suggests a role in restriction of immune signaling. We now include discussion of this newly published work and highlight the potential role of the schlafen domain in immune evasion during infection (see the Discussion). Future biochemical and virology studies will be required to understand the function of the schlafen domain in mammalian poxvirus infection.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Reviewer 2:</p><p>[…] Overall, this is a very interesting and well written manuscript.

Building on our biochemical and structural analysis defining the active site residues for VACV, AcNPV, and <italic>T. ni</italic> poxin enzymes, we inactivated each enzyme with a single His&gt;Ala mutation and measured stable poxin–2′3′-cGAMP complex formation using an electrophoretic mobility shift assay. Under these conditions, viral VACV and AcNPV poxin enzymes retain the ability to form a stable complex with 2′3′-cGAMP and exhibit a <italic>K<sub>d</sub></italic> of ~500–800 nM (see Figure 2—figure supplement 2). In contrast, no stable complex formation is detected for the host <italic>T. ni</italic> poxin enzyme. These results agree with our kinetic analysis demonstrating viral poxins have a lower <italic>K<sub>m</sub></italic> for 2′3′-cGAMP cleavage and further support a model where host poxins are specifically adapted for immune regulation. However, an important caveat of these experiments is that the alanine substitution in the poxin enzyme active site likely reduces substrate affinity and we note in the figure legend that these experiments therefore underestimate the affinity of poxin for 2′3′-cGAMP.</p><p>As our manuscript is focused on detailed characterization of VACV, AcNPV, and <italic>T. ni</italic> poxin enzymes we have elected to not test enzymatic kinetics for further poxin homologs. We have added a line to the text to acknowledge that divergent poxin homologs may exhibit alterative reaction rates (see subsection “Host and viral poxins employ alternative catalytic residues for 2′3′-cGAMP cleavage”). Additionally, we note that the hymenoptera species encoding poxin homologs are species that parasitize lepidopteran insects and lay their eggs within moth and butterfly larvae and it is possible that these poxin enzymes play a similar role to viral poxins in suppressing activation of the lepidopteran immune response.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>2) In Figure 6, the authors use a neighbor-joining algorithm to generate phylogenetic trees that they then use to infer deep ancestral relationships of these diverse enzymes.

We have conducted further experiments to assess the activity of amarillovirus poxins, and we now include new experimental data measuring cleavage-site specificity. These results demonstrate that the EQH/ST cleavage site mapped for XCV poxin through Edman degradation sequencing is essential for proteolytic cleavage, and support that the histidine residue at position P1 is particularly important for cleavage site recognition. In addition to including these new data (see Figure 5—figure supplement 2), we agree with the reviewer’s point and have added a question mark in this panel of the model to convey that the exact origin of the ancestral protease is uncertain (see revised Figure 6).</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>4) The authors state in the Discussion that their data suggest that 2'3'-cGAMP is a predominant ligand in insect immune signaling. Have they shown that these divergent poxins, especially those from amarilloviruses, can exclusively hydrolyze 2'3'-cGAMP?</p></disp-quote><p>We have addressed this point with new experimental data to specifically compare the ability of poxin enzymes to cleave 2′3′-cGAMP or the closely related isomer 3′3′-cGAMP. We re-screened representative poxin enzymes from Figure 1 and found that each tested homolog specifically targets 2′3′-cGAMP (see Figure 5—figure supplement 2), with one exception. <italic>Dendrolimus punctatus</italic> cypovirus 22 (DpCV22) poxin shows promiscuous degradation of 3ʹ3ʹ-cGAMP and 2ʹ3ʹ-cGAMP. Our new data indicate that while certain poxin enzymes may have lower substrate specificity, as a whole, poxins broadly maintain a high degree of specificity for 2ʹ3ʹ-cGAMP.</p></body></sub-article></article>
