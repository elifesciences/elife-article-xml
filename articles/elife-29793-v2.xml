We show here that a rat’s position can be decoded with high spatiotemporal resolution from ACC activity. ACC neurons encoded the current state of the animal and task, except for brief excursions that sometimes occurred at target feeders. During excursions, the decoded position became more similar to a remote target feeder than the rat’s physical position. Excursions recruited activation of neurons encoding choice and reward, and the likelihood of excursions at a feeder was inversely correlated with feeder preference. These data suggest that the excursion phenomenon was related to evaluating real or fictive choice outcomes, particularly after disfavoured reinforcements. We propose that the multiplexing of position with choice-related information forms a mental model isomorphic with the task space, which can be mentally navigated via excursions to recall multimodal information about the utility of remote locations.</p></abstract><kwd-group kwd-group-type="author-keywords"><kwd>prospection</kwd><kwd>cognitive map</kwd><kwd>decoding</kwd><kwd>neural network</kwd><kwd>ensemble activity</kwd><kwd>choice</kwd></kwd-group><kwd-group kwd-group-type="research-organism"><title>Research organism</title><kwd>Rat</kwd></kwd-group><funding-group><award-group id="fund1"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100000145</institution-id><institution>Alberta Innovates - Health Solutions</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>McNaughton</surname><given-names>Bruce L</given-names></name><name><surname>Euston</surname><given-names>David</given-names></name><name><surname>Gruber</surname><given-names>Aaron J</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund2"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100000038</institution-id><institution>Natural Sciences and Engineering Research Council of Canada</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Hashemniayetorshizi</surname><given-names>Saeedeh</given-names></name><name><surname>McNaughton</surname><given-names>Bruce L</given-names></name><name><surname>Euston</surname><given-names>David</given-names></name><name><surname>Gruber</surname><given-names>Aaron J</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><funding-statement>The funders had no role in study design, data collection and interpretation, or the decision to submit the work for publication.</funding-statement></funding-group><custom-meta-group><custom-meta specific-use="meta-only"><meta-name>Author impact statement</meta-name><meta-value>The anterior cingulate cortex intermixes a precise spatial map with a cognitive map of the task, and spontaneously recalls multimodal information about unrealized choice outcomes during pauses in behavior after reinforcements.</meta-value></custom-meta></custom-meta-group></article-meta></front><body><sec id="s1" sec-type="intro"><title>Introduction</title><p>The ACC and other nearby structures in the medial prefrontal cortex (mPFC) play an important role in the control of both memories and decisions (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Euston et al., 2012</xref>). These structures influence memory retrieval via connectivity with the hippocampus (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">Ito et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib54">Rajasethupathy et al., 2015</xref>), and are thought to utilize hippocampal output to form semantic or schematic knowledge of the world from past experience (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib45">McClelland et al., 1995</xref>). Activation of patterned neural activity in the mPFC may thus play an important role in utilizing experiential or schematic knowledge to plan or control behaviour (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib61">Tse et al., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib63">Wang et al., 2012</xref>). Neurons in the ACC and nearby regions encode a variety of task features related to reinforcement and decisions (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">Kennerley et al., 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Gruber et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib59">Sul et al., 2011</xref>), and many are also selectively active over large regions of the task space (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">Jung et al., 1998</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Euston and McNaughton, 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Fujisawa et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">Jadhav et al., 2016</xref>). The function of this broad and distributed spatial mapping by individual ACC units has remained more contentious than the sparse encoding of location by neurons in the hippocampus (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Burton et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Hyman et al., 2012</xref>).</p><p>The hippocampus contains ‘place cells’ that provide information about the position of an animal in an environment (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib48">O'Keefe and Dostrovsky, 1971</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib64">Wilson and McNaughton, 1993</xref>), which is utilized by the ACC (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Burton et al., 2009</xref>). Although ACC neurons had generally been thought not to generate place fields (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib52">Poucet, 1997</xref>), recent work has revealed neurons in mPFC with spatially specific firing that typically span over 50 cm, and that are distributed over the task environment (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Fujisawa et al., 2008</xref>). These are properties expected of a place code. Nonetheless, the broad spatial encoding in the mPFC has often been interpreted as signaling contextual features, such as the environment (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Hyman et al., 2012</xref>) and task (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib43">Ma et al., 2016</xref>). The ACC also appears to utilize reinforcement information from past actions to engage action strategies that improve cost-benefit outcomes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Botvinick et al., 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Amiez et al., 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">Kennerley et al., 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib56">Rushworth et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Heilbronner and Hayden, 2016</xref>), particularly when rapid shifts in strategy are needed to optimize reward acquisition (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib51">Posner et al., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib50">Passingham and Wise, 2012</xref>). One of its specific functions is to encode unattained rewards (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Hayden et al., 2009a</xref>), which may contribute to its role in signalling regret when outcomes do not meet expectations (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Coricelli et al., 2005</xref>). It is possible that the ACC uses a fine-grained spatial map as a mnemonic scheme to recall possible alternate outcomes at other locations for such processing, but we are unaware of any direct evidence with sufficient spatiotemporal resolution to accurately decode such shifts.</p></sec><sec id="s2" sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><sec id="s2-1"><title>Precise spatio-temporal encoding of position by ACC</title><p>Because populations of broadly tuned cells can encode quantities with more precision than the encoding of individual cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib40">Kim et al., 2012</xref>), we first sought to determine whether population activity in the ACC accurately encodes the position of an animal. We recorded ensembles of ACC neurons while rats performed a binary choice task on a figure-8 track (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1A</xref>). Two target feeders at the north corners of the track could be reached after turning right or left at the choice point, and a third feeder in the central segment was used to motivate rats to return to the starting position. Rats received reinforcement at the central feeder on every trial. The effort-reward utility of each choice was independently controlled by elevating the target feeders to one of three heights and by providing either a small or large reward volume. The utilities were held fixed for 16 consecutive trials and the animals were forced to alternate between the right and left options on the first 10 trials before being allowed free selection of either option for the remaining 6 trials of the block. The task was run in a 6-block sequence of 96 trials (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1B</xref>), and the same sequence would restart upon completion within each session. The reward contingencies were counterbalanced among right and left feeders between sessions. Rats completed 162–256 trials per session. Animals received the same small reward at the central feeder. We simultaneously recorded position and neural activity in the ACC (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1C–D</xref>), and found that most cells activated over large areas of the track (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1</xref>), consistent with previous reports.</p><fig-group><fig id="fig1" position="float"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.29793.002</object-id><label>Figure 1.</label><caption><title>Task and neural recording.</title><p>(<bold>A</bold>) Schematic illustration of the figure-8 track, showing the locations of the feeders (cylindrical depressions), height-adjustable platforms (indicated by arrows), and movable gates (translucent rectangles).

We found, however, that we could achieve significantly lower decoding error (36% reduction; t(6) = 9.0, p=0.0001, power = 1) than the Bayesian method by using a deep artificial neural network (dANN) to decode location from patterns of neural activity in bins of 20–50 ms (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2B</xref>; see Materials and methods). The dANN was memoryless in that it only used information from the present time bin for the predictions. It could exploit higher-order statistical relationships among inputs than could the Bayesian method, and could learn to ignore spurious information. Its superior performance therefore likely demonstrates that either these higher-order statistics carry a significant amount of information about spatial position, as previously predicted (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Fujisawa et al., 2008</xref>), or that the representation of non-spatial features hampers Bayesian reconstruction. Our analysis of multiple sessions from four animals revealed that approximately 30 randomly selected ACC units are required for good reconstruction accuracy, whereas near asymptotic accuracy can be achieved by using the 17 most informative cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1</xref>). We therefore focused subsequent analysis on seven sessions from two animals with at least 40 simultaneously recorded cells so as to achieve decoding error close to the apparent asymptotic limit.</p><fig id="fig2" position="float"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.29793.004</object-id><label>Figure 2.</label><caption><title>Decoding position from ensemble ACC activity.</title><p>(<bold>A</bold>) The spatial selectivity of the nine most informative ACC cells for decoding position in one session chosen by the decoding network.

We shifted each spike time by a randomly drawn value from a distribution that was proportional to the variance of the cell’s firing interval (25% of its STD). The dANN was trained on some trials of the uncorrupted data, and tested on different trials with the noisy data (mean spike shift was 25 ms). This increased the error (RMSE) by 1.3% (0.14 cm), which was a small yet statistically significant difference (t(6) = 4.8; p=0.003; power = 0.95). This indicates that spike timing on the order of 25 ms contained useful information for the decoding with the present neuronal sample size. Furthermore, the noise did not cause any large deviations in decoding. Only 0.07% of samples deviated more than 25 cm from the original decoding, and none were more than 50 cm (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2C</xref>). These data indicate that the decoder is robust against moderate levels of spike jitter. The median decoding accuracy of the rat’s position on the task was less than 10 cm (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2D–E</xref>). This is much less than the length of the animal’s body, and much less than the spatial selectivity of individual cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Fujisawa et al., 2008</xref>).</p></sec><sec id="s2-2"><title>Invariance of spatial encoding during task sessions</title><p>We analyzed the stability of the spatial information over the entire maze through time. For this, we separated all the trials that belonged to the trial configuration (reward, effort, direction) with the maximum number of trials in each session. Then, we performed two different tests. In one, we created the training set by selecting every other trial in the list and used the remaining trials as the test set. In the second test, we used the first half of the trials as the training set and used the second half of the trials as the test set. If the spatial encoding shifted as a result of the intervening configurations (block types), or drifted in time, then the decoding accuracy in these two cases should be different. We found that decoding errors were not significantly different in these two cases (0.6 cm change in error, t<sub>6</sub> = 1.28, p=0.24). This analysis provides some evidence that the position-related features of neural activity used by the decoding network are stable within the session, despite changes in effort and reward contingencies that occur during intervening blocks.</p></sec><sec id="s2-3"><title>Excursions of spatial encoding from the physical position to a feeder</title><p>The mean spatial decoding error was low in all positions on the track (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2F–H</xref>). The decoded position, however, sometimes deviated from the actual position by up to nearly 100 cm, and these large excursions occurred almost exclusively at the two choice-option feeders (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2G–H</xref>). These excursions were not random in time or decoded position. Rather, the excursions consisted of several consecutive points encoding the alternate target feeder before returning to the present location of the rat (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3A–B</xref>; <xref ref-type="video" rid="video1">Video 1</xref>). The localization of these excursion endpoints was particularly striking because our decoder network output only an x and y coordinate, with no constraints that the decoded position lie on the track. This pattern of endpoints is therefore exceedingly unlikely by chance (χ<sup>2</sup> = 484, p=1 E-40, power = 1). These excursions did not originate or terminate at the center feeder, even though the animal received the same reward type at all feeders, and the volume at the center feeder was equivalent to the small volume at the choice feeders. These features strongly suggest that the excursion phenomenon is involved in computations related to evaluating the choice options, and not related to general qualities of the reward or to planning the immediately next action, which was always a return to the center feeder as enforced by gates on the track.</p><fig id="fig3" position="float"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.29793.005</object-id><label>Figure 3.</label><caption><title>Excursions of encoded position sometimes shift to the alternate choice feeder.</title><p>(<bold>A</bold>) Example of one excursion episode.

Although excursions occasionally occurred during the reinforcement, most occurred after the reinforcement and prior to locomotion away from the feeder (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3D</xref>). The duration of the excursions was appreciably longer than the width of the smoothing kernel (120 ms), so the end-points of the excursions were not affected by the smoothing. The dynamics of the transition, however, occurred on a time scale less than the kernel width and was therefore strongly affected. The intermediate points of excursion between the feeder sites appear to be a blend of the encoding of the two feeder sites coming from the neural dynamics and/or the smoothing kernel in our analysis. We therefore suggest that the phenomenon is more accurately conceptualized as a shift rather than a replay of the true trajectory in the physical space.</p><p>We next sought further independent evidence as to whether the excursion events were an artifact of misclassification rather than a neurophysiological phenomenon. One possibility is that both target feeders are encoded by similar ensemble activity because of shared reward encoding, or some other feature, so that the network might confuse left and right feeders such that the decoded position might appear to jump from one to the other. To address this concern, we first used linear discriminant analysis to test if the neural patterns at the feeders are distinct from one another. Linear discriminant analysis of the input activity patterns in the absence of excursion did form distinct clusters for each feeder, indicative of unique pattern features at each feeder (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3E</xref>). This method is independent of our decoder, and therefore provides graphical validation. In order to quantify the pattern separation, we trained a new 3-layer network to classify patterns of neural activity from each of the three feeders, and then tested the classification accuracy (via cross-validation) on either samples of the original data, original data corrupted by noise, or fully shuffled data (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3F–G</xref>). These tests include all trials, both with and without excursion events. If the excursion events were due to a classification error arising from similarity of neural patterns at the feeders, then adding noise should decrease accuracy. The noise did not significantly reduce feeder decoding accuracy (t(6) = 1.02; p=0.35, power = 0.87), but fully shuffling the spike time intervals did (t(6) = 32.6; p=3e-8, power = 1). These data indicate that the activity patterns at the feeders are sufficiently distinct such that the introduction of noise does not cause misclassification, suggesting that the excursions are not a consequence of small random variation of the inputs.</p><p>The analyses above do not rule out the possibility that the excursions arise from brief shifts from the unique activity features at each feeder to an activity state common to both feeders. For instance, the reward encoding neurons could strongly activate to overshadow the position information in some instances, and this could produce a pattern that emerges at both feeders, but is distinct from the normal encoding at the feeders, and thereby confuses the decoder. This should be apparent in the variance of patterns at target feeders represented by the decoder network. PCA of activation in layer 3 of the position decoder shows distinct clusters for the non-excursion patterns at the target feeders (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3H</xref>). Moreover, the excursion patterns do not overlap completely or form their own cluster, and instead tend to overlap with the unoccupied target feeder cluster. We next conducted an independent and quantitative test for a common state by computing the classification accuracy of untransformed ACC patterns (input to the network) among the four classes: feeder A during an excursion (A’); feeder B during an excursion (B’); feeder A not during excursion (A); and feeder B not during excursion (B). If the excursions are because of a transition to a common state from both feeders, then the excursion patterns should be highly discriminable from the non-excursion patterns at the same feeder (A’ from A, and B’ from B), but not discriminable from each other (A’ from B’). We found strong evidence for the former, but not the latter. We used the area under the curve (AUC) of the receiver operator characteristic (ROC) to quantify discriminability of samples from pairs of these conditions. An AUC value close to 0.5 indicates that the patterns from two classes are indiscriminable, whereas an AUC value close to one indicates that patterns are highly discriminable by the classifier. AUC values between these limits indicate that features of the patterns are sometimes similar and sometimes dissimilar in at least some dimensions. The discrimination of excursions from non-excursions at the same feeder (A’ from A, and B’ from B) was very high (AUC = 0.94). On the other hand, the patterns during the excursions from the two feeders (A’ from B’) were discriminable at a moderate level (mean AUC = 0.75). This latter analysis was limited in power because of the low number of excursions at the preferred feeder relative to the dimensionality of the patterns. Nonetheless, these data indicate that the untransformed input patterns during excursions can often be distinguished based on the position of the rat. The non-linear transform of the input by the middle layers of the decoding network apparently separates the excursions from one another, but not from the typical feeder patterns (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3H</xref>). In sum, the non-excursion patterns (A, B) are highly discriminable (e.g. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3E–G</xref>), as are the excursion patterns from the non-excursion patterns at the target feeder (A, A’, and B, B’). The excursion patterns sometimes overlap with each other (A’, B’), and with the pattern from the unselected feeder (A’, B and B’, A; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3B,H</xref>). It thus appears that some features of the encoding shift to be more similar to the unselected feeder during excursion events. Because reward and location were confounded in the experimental design, we cannot rule out the possibility that reward encoding contributes to the phenomena. The inability to fully discriminate the excursion patterns from one another could involve some feature of the reward, such as volume, which flips between the choice feeders during the session. We therefore next investigated if units encoding reward were activated during the excursions.</p></sec><sec id="s2-4"><title>Excursions were more likely to occur at less-preferred feeders, and encoded reward and choice information</title><p>Rats developed a strong feeder preference during free-choice trials within each block because of the unequal effort-reward utilities. Within each block of 6 free-choice trials, the preferred feeder was chosen an average of 5.3 ± 0.5 times. We used this choice bias as a measure of revealed preference among feeders, and analyzed the 10 forced-choice trials that preceded it. The selective occurrence of the excursions at the right-side feeder site in these forced-choice trials was strongly anti-correlated with the revealed preference for this feeder on free-choice trials (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4A</xref>; r<sup>2</sup> = 0.86; F(6) = 31.5; p=0.002; power = 0.97). In other words, the excursion was much more likely to occur when the rat was forced to select the less-preferred feeder. The excursions also emerged more frequently in free-choice trials when rats chose the less-preferred option. This dependence suggests that excursions are related to disfavored outcomes, consistent with proposals that primate ACC is involved in regret or signalling other outcomes that could have occurred (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Coricelli et al., 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Hayden et al., 2009a</xref>). This supposition predicts that excursions should contain information related to the value of choice options. We thus next sought to determine if cells encoding choice or reward become activated during excursions. We first used logistic regression with norm-1 regularization to determine the degree to which cells encoded reward or choice information at the feeder locations in the absence of excursions (see Materials and methods). We found that 30% and 36% of cells were strongly predictive of reward and choice, respectively. We next independently determined which cells in the population significantly increased firing during excursions. This analysis revealed that some cells predictive or reward and/or choice activated during the excursions (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4B</xref>).</p><fig id="fig4" position="float"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.29793.007</object-id><label>Figure 4.</label><caption><title>Excursions are more likely at non-preferred feeders, and encode choice-reward information.</title><p>(<bold>A</bold>) The relationship between excursions frequency and feeder preference.

This is a much finer spatial scale than the very broad spatial sensitivity of individual neurons in the ACC and nearby mPFC (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Fujisawa et al., 2008</xref>). This raises the possibility that ACC ensembles may represent environmental features on a fine spatial resolution. Moreover, we found that the encoded position normally tracked the current state of the rat, but sometimes dissociated from its physical position at the target feeders. These excursions did not occur at the central feeder, were more likely to occur at the disfavoured target feeder, and involved the activation of neurons encoding reward and choice. We suggest that this is functional evidence for the evaluation of choice outcomes that is more likely to occur following disappointing reinforcements. Moreover, the preponderance of evidence suggests that the ACC encoding during most excursions became more similar to the unselected target feeder than the selected one. If so, the data provide evidence that the ACC evaluates unrealized choice outcomes at locations remote from the animal’s position.</p><p>These data are consistent with many previous findings and proposals. First, indirect evidence has previously suggested that ACC and adjacent areas in mPFC encode the position of the animal and objects on a fine spatial scale. For instance, small deviations in running path has been shown to explain a significant amount of variance in rat ACC activity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Euston and McNaughton, 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Cowen et al., 2012</xref>), and mPFC lesions impair object-in-place memory but not object memory (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Barker et al., 2007</xref>). Second, ACC encodes a variety of task-related information such as reward, choice, and effort, which is thought to support choices among options with differing costs and benefits (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Botvinick et al., 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Amiez et al., 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Euston and McNaughton, 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">Kennerley et al., 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Euston et al., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib56">Rushworth et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Cowen et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Heilbronner and Hayden, 2016</xref>). A specific function of individual ACC units in monkeys is the signalling of fictive outcomes, which are potential reinforcements that did not occur (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Hayden et al., 2009a</xref>). This could be analogous to the activation of reward-encoding units during excursions, although the difference in species, spatial component, and explicit cues for the unattained location/reward limit the comparison to general features. The task used here also involves choice conflict between reward and effort. The ACC appears to play a role in resolving such conflicts (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Hillman and Bilkey, 2010</xref>), and could account for the high frequency of excursions in the present data. If the excursions support the comparison of realized and fictive outcomes more generally, this suggests that the broad post-reward activation of neurons in the ACC and nearby structures observed in several species (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Amiez et al., 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">Kennerley et al., 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Gruber et al., 2010</xref>) may involve similar excursions and the recall of information in multiple modes.</p><p>Our present data extend previous work demonstrating that the activity of mPFC is sufficient to decode spatial position on a track (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Fujisawa et al., 2008</xref>). Whether the encoded information is a pure spatial signal or due to encoding of spatially-locked actions, stimuli, and/or events remains unclear. The task is repetitive and rats’ movements tends to be stereotyped, so that specific actions (e.g., turns) and task events (e.g., approach to barrier) occur at the same location on every trial. Whatever its nature, our analysis reveals that the ensemble activity is sufficient to predict where an animal is with an unprecedented level of spatial resolution. It should be emphasized that this spatial information is multiplexed with many other task features encoded by this region, such as reward and effort, but can be extracted by an appropriately trained neural network decoder. This work extends on the work of others who have shown that the medial prefrontal region encodes a trajectory through task space (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib41">Lapish et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Durstewitz et al., 2010</xref>) and shows that, at least under some circumstances, such a state-space trajectory is isomorphic with real world spatial coordinates.</p><p>Why is spatial encoding prevalent in the ACC? We propose that the ACC may form a topographically-organized representational space, based on real space or action/events at particular locations on the maze, which can serve as a scaffold for the encoding of behaviourally-relevant events. For example, if the rat is attacked by a neighbor near its nest, the ACC may encode the event and trigger avoidance on subsequent visits to that vicinity. This is similar to a recent proposal that the orbitofrontal cortex uses a map of abstract task-states to facilitate reinforcement-based behavioural adaptation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib66">Wilson et al., 2014</xref>), except that in our case, the representation has real-world spatial correlates. Our proposal is also closely related to past proposals that the medial PFC likely forms and stores schema which map context and events onto appropriate actions (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">Jung et al., 1998</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib46">Miller and Cohen, 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Alexander and Brown, 2011</xref>), which serves to engage appropriate emotional or motoric responses to a given set of events in light of past experience (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Bechara and Damasio, 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Euston et al., 2012</xref>). Again, the differentiating feature of our proposal is a higher spatial resolution. The spatial representation in mPFC often smoothly varies as an animal navigates the task space, but it can also drastically shift its response profile over the same task space in some circumstances, such as a switch of task rules (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib55">Rich and Shapiro, 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Durstewitz et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib43">Ma et al., 2016</xref>). These investigators proposed that this provides a shift in context so as to facilitate learning or utilizing different sets of associations (e.g. action-outcome). It remains unclear whether these shifts are due to a global remapping of the entire ensemble or only a subset of task-relevant cells. The decoding algorithms demonstrated here may be useful for determining if schemas (a.k.a. mental models or cognitive maps) retain associative information about space or other features across such shifts, or if ACC wipes the slate clean in some conditions.</p><p>The proposal of a mnemonic schema organized around position does not preclude its role in flexibly encoding other information to support decisions. Rather, it is a framework for the integration of information over several time scales, from consolidated memories to short-term ‘working’ memory, which is well supported by a large body of evidence in rodents and primates (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Euston et al., 2012</xref>). The ACC thus uses information gleaned over both recent and remote experiences to form a model of the world organized around the spatial feature of the environment that also includes features useful for decisions that impact affective state, such as finding food and avoiding pain.</p><p>A novel aspect of the present data is the excursions from the present state at the choice feeders. This raises the possibility that the brain can mentally navigate the ACC map to recall information, or even generate hypothetical states consistent with the world model. Such prospection is consistent with the limited evidence available in other rodent PFC regions (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib58">Steiner and Redish, 2014</xref>), and is consistent with evidence in primates, which we discuss later. In our study, these shifts may have been due to encoding of (1) the spatial location of the alternate feeder, (2) the expected reward at that location and/or (3) the sensory features (e.g. proximity to a ramp) of the alternate location. These factors were partially confounded in our study. The mPFC is well known to encode reward amount (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib53">Pratt and Mizumori, 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">Kargo et al., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Horst and Laubach, 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Insel and Barnes, 2015</xref>) and may plausibly encode sensory features, but our evidence weighs in favor of a spatial shift. First, the excursion patterns were distinct from the patterns normally observed at the feeder, but overlapped with the patterns at the remote feeder. Second, excursions did not originate or terminate at the central feeder, even though the reward type and volume was comparable to that at the target feeders. Ultimately, whether the shifts are based on space, reward, or sensory features, our data still suggest that excursions involved a shift away from the present target feeder to encode features of the unselected target feeder, thus processing information related to choices and outcomes. The partial discrimination among excursion patterns may result from confounds of reward and locations, the similarity of sensory features of the two target feeders, or could reflect processing of latent information (e.g. affective state). We also note that spontaneous reactivation of ensemble neural activity during replay events often differs in the number or timing of spikes as compared to the patterns during behaviour (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Foster and Wilson, 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Euston et al., 2007</xref>). The excursions in our data were relatively brief as compared to the time of feeder occupancy, raising the possibility of temporal compression as observed during replay, and likely introducing additional confounds for the classification analysis. We made no attempt to optimize the pre-processing of the input signal, such as the smoothing kernel width or normalization/convolution, which likely would have partially accounted for these effects.</p><p>We speculate that the brain dynamics involved in the excursions are not isolated to the ACC, but are likely coordinated with that in other brain regions. The hippocampus sometimes also generates replay events after reward consumption (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Foster and Wilson, 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Carr et al., 2011</xref>). These occur during large amplitude fluctuations of the field potential called sharp wave ripples, and occur in bouts lasting several hundred milliseconds. Task-related cells in the mPFC are modulated by these ripples following reward consumption, suggesting that this is a period of communication between the hippocampus and mPFC (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">Jadhav et al., 2016</xref>). A similar post-reward replay in the sensory domain has been reported in the orbitofrontal cortex (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib58">Steiner and Redish, 2014</xref>). Coordination of such events in ACC, orbitofrontal cortex, and hippocampus during pauses of directed behaviour following reinforcement would account nicely for the activity pattern and timing of the so-called default mode network (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Buckner et al., 2008</xref>). Activation of this network in humans occurs during pauses in directed action, typically after reinforcement, and is associated with ‘mind wandering’ often involving imagined shifts in time and place (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Buckner and Carroll, 2007</xref>). Analogous, and possibly homologous, default mode networks have been reported in non-human primates and rodents (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Hayden et al., 2009b</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib44">Mantini et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib42">Lu et al., 2012</xref>). The ACC, hippocampus, and other structures comprising the telencephalon emerged early in vertebrate evolution hundreds of millions of years ago, and likely supported a predatory foraging habit (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib47">Murray et al., 2017</xref>). The widespread conservation of the telencephalon among modern vertebrates suggests that it has functions useful in many situations and natural environments. It is therefore possible that a proposed human homologue (area 24) of rodent ACC (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib62">Uylings et al., 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib57">Seamans et al., 2008</xref>) may also employ spatial associations to organize and navigate a schematic world model (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">Kaplan et al., 2017</xref>). It may, therefore, not be a coincidence that space-based imagery is one of the most prevalent top-down mnemonic strategies employed by humans, which has been used throughout recorded human history (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib49">O'Keefe and Nadel, 1978</xref>). For instance, a person may imagine being in a particular restaurant in order to recall food options and quality, which is useful for making future dinner plans. The large expansion of granular prefrontal cortex, much of which connects extensively with ACC, likely endows primates with a greater ability to abstract problems (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib57">Seamans et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib47">Murray et al., 2017</xref>), and possibly a greater ability to exert top-down control over ACC dynamics. Therefore, if primate ACC has a schematic world model organized similarly to that shown here, the dynamics of excursions and any shifted perception associated with them are likely different than those in rodents. In other words, the neurophysiology that leads to excursions might be similar in rats and humans, but we make no claims that the prospective representation of information via excursions in rats is perceived or controlled similarly to prospection in humans. Along the same lines, the strong correlation of excursions with disfavour of a feeder is consistent with the activation of human ACC in regretful situations (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Coricelli et al., 2005</xref>), but we have no independent means to assess if rats perceive regret in the present data.</p><p>We propose that the excursion events represent navigation of a schematic world model organized around spatial position for some purpose related to task performance, such as comparing the utility of the obtained reward to an unattained one. The emergence of excursions exclusively at the target feeders, and not the center feeder, suggests a role in outcome comparison or future choice. Excursions did not terminate at the center feeder, suggesting they do not encode the subsequent action from the target feeder, which is always a return to the center feeder as enforced by gates on the track. It is possible that the excursions reflect an unexecuted plan to move from the occupied feeder to the other. If this were the case, however, we would expect to occasionally observe excursions when the rat is at the center feeder or other location on the track. A possible alternative is that the excursions reflect a mechanism for shifting strategies. The rodent ACC is involved in shifting responses (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Joel et al., 1997</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Birrell and Brown, 2000</xref>), and appears to sustain information over time (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Dalley et al., 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib60">Takehara-Nishiuchi and McNaughton, 2008</xref>). Although speculative, it is therefore possible that the excursions trigger a memory trace in ACC that promotes a response shift at the next visit to the choice point on the track. In other words, the ACC may have made a decision for the next choice while at the target feeder, which could preclude excursions at the center feeder or other intermediate point. The ACC is only one of several dissociated circuits that influence binary choice (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Gruber and McDonald, 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Gruber et al., 2015</xref>), and is posited to bias competition among these other systems (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib47">Murray et al., 2017</xref>). Excursions may therefore have a probabilistic influence on future choice rather than fully determining it. The present data show only a correlation between revealed feeder preference and the likelihood of excursion. The design of the present task (e.g. forced alternation and relatively short blocks) prevents us from rigorously testing whether the excursion events influence future choice. We note that other evidence of spontaneous activation of task-related neural ensembles in the cortex and hippocampus has similarly shown correlation with general features of behaviour, such as learning, but most have not yet been shown to accurately predict future actions on a trial-by-trial basis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib65">Wilson and McNaughton, 1994</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Euston et al., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Fujisawa et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Dragoi and Tonegawa, 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib58">Steiner and Redish, 2014</xref>; but see <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">Johnson and Redish, 2007</xref>). We anticipate that advances in collecting and decoding ensemble neural activity will reveal such linkages between retrospective or prospective encoding and future behaviour.</p></sec><sec id="s4" sec-type="materials|methods"><title>Materials and methods</title><sec id="s4-1"><title>Behavioural apparatus</title><p>We constructed a running track 15 cm wide, with 36 cm high walls on both sides. It was configured into a ‘figure-8’ track measuring 102 cm long, 114 cm wide, and 60 cm height from the floor. Reward was delivered via three conical plastic feeders (24mm diameter). One was located on the central arm, and two others on 6 x 15 cm platforms at the north corners of the track. The reinforcement was a chocolate-flavored beverage (Ensure, Abbott laboratories, Brockville, ON). The platforms were elevated 0-48 cm above the track. The ascent to the platform was by a vertical wire mesh (1.6cm thick galvanized steel wire with a 1.25cm square spacing). The descent was by a ramp made from the same material, but with a solid opaque plastic immediately under the mesh to provide support. The elevation of each platform was independently controlled by a stepper motor (Model 23Y9, Anaheim Automation, Anaheim, CA) driven by a stepper motor controller (Model G251X, Gecko drive, Tustin CA). A rack and pinion gear system was used to carry the platform up and down.

Rats were habituated to handling for two weeks prior to the experiment. We surgically implanted a recording drive prior to any training. The drive and implantation were carried out as described previously (Euston and McNaughton, 2006). The position of the animal and neural signals were recorded simultaneously with a digital acquisition system (Cheetah SX, Neuralynx, Tucson, AZ). Neural signals were amplified with a unity gain headstage (HS-54, Neuralynx, Tucson, AZ), amplified with a gain of 1000, and band pass filtered between 600 and 6000 Hz. Voltage waveforms exceeding a manually set threshold were recorded during behaviour, and then sorted into distinct clusters offline.</p><p>Animals began training on the figure-8 track following a one-week recovery from surgery. Behaviour was shaped by allowing rats to navigate the track for 7-10 days with no variation of reward volume or barrier height. All subsequent sessions followed a fixed reward/effort schedule in which the task was organized into 6 blocks of 16 trials. Gates on the track forced the rat to alternate between the left and right loops on the first 10 trials of the block. The rat was free to choose either side for the remaining 6 trials of the block. The barrier height (0-46 cm) and/or the reward volume (30 or 120 uL of chocolate beverage) at one or both of the feeders changed across each block. The block order was: [S0, B0], [S0, B1], [S0, B2], [S2, B2], [B0, S0], [B2, S0], where the letter indicates reward volume (S for small, B for big), and the number codes the relative effort.

We further eliminated neurons with an average firing rate below 0.5Hz because our initial tests indicated that these cells did not improve decoding accuracy. We then used a Gaussian kernel with a standard deviation of 150 ms to smooth the spike data, and then binned the resultant signal by 50 ms. The position of the animal assigned to each bin was the average of the coordinates of the video tracker system for the corresponding time window. We next applied the square root transformation to the binned firing rates to normalize the activity distribution (e.g. make them more Gaussian) among neurons. We then used the z-transform so that the activity of each neuron would have zero mean and unit variance. For decoding using the Bayesian method, we discretized space into regions of 4 cm by 3 cm. The dANN method operated at the pixel resolution of the video tracker (0.27 x 0.24 cm). To ensure that the difference in spatial resolution among decoding methods did not present confounds, we applied the dANN method to the data discretized in the same way as for the Bayesian method. This did not affect the prediction error, so we only show the results from the finer resolution in the figures.</p><p>The position decoder was a multi-layer feedforward artificial neural network with three hidden layers. The number of units in the input layer equals the number of recorded neurons in each session. The number of units in the first, second, and third hidden layer is 100, 50, and 25, respectively. The output layer consists of two units, which represent the coordinates of the position on the track. The activation function of the first two hidden layers is rectified linear, and the activation function of the third layer is hyperbolic tangent. The number of units and the activation function for each layer were selected via cross validation. The quality of predictions was quantified with the mean squared error (MSE) between the actual position of the rat and the predicted location:<disp-formula id="equ1"><mml:math id="m1"><mml:mstyle displaystyle="true" scriptlevel="0"><mml:mrow><mml:mi>M</mml:mi><mml:mi>S</mml:mi><mml:mi>E</mml:mi><mml:mo>=</mml:mo><mml:mfrac><mml:mn>1</mml:mn><mml:mrow><mml:mn>2</mml:mn><mml:mi>N</mml:mi></mml:mrow></mml:mfrac><mml:munderover><mml:mo>∑</mml:mo><mml:mrow><mml:mi>i</mml:mi><mml:mo>=</mml:mo><mml:mn>1</mml:mn></mml:mrow><mml:mi>N</mml:mi></mml:munderover><mml:msup><mml:mrow><mml:mo>|</mml:mo><mml:mrow><mml:mo>|</mml:mo><mml:mrow><mml:mrow><mml:mo>[</mml:mo><mml:mtable columnspacing="1em" rowspacing="4pt"><mml:mtr><mml:mtd><mml:msub><mml:mrow><mml:mover><mml:mi>x</mml:mi><mml:mo stretchy="false">^</mml:mo></mml:mover></mml:mrow><mml:mi>i</mml:mi></mml:msub></mml:mtd></mml:mtr><mml:mtr><mml:mtd><mml:msub><mml:mrow><mml:mover><mml:mi>y</mml:mi><mml:mo stretchy="false">^</mml:mo></mml:mover></mml:mrow><mml:mi>i</mml:mi></mml:msub></mml:mtd></mml:mtr></mml:mtable><mml:mo>]</mml:mo></mml:mrow><mml:mo>−</mml:mo><mml:mrow><mml:mo>[</mml:mo><mml:mtable columnspacing="1em" rowspacing="4pt"><mml:mtr><mml:mtd><mml:msub><mml:mi>x</mml:mi><mml:mi>i</mml:mi></mml:msub></mml:mtd></mml:mtr><mml:mtr><mml:mtd><mml:msub><mml:mi>y</mml:mi><mml:mi>i</mml:mi></mml:msub></mml:mtd></mml:mtr></mml:mtable><mml:mo>]</mml:mo></mml:mrow></mml:mrow><mml:mo>|</mml:mo></mml:mrow><mml:mo>|</mml:mo></mml:mrow><mml:mn>2</mml:mn></mml:msup></mml:mrow></mml:mstyle></mml:math></disp-formula>where <inline-formula><mml:math id="inf1"><mml:mstyle displaystyle="true" scriptlevel="0"><mml:mrow><mml:msub><mml:mrow><mml:mover><mml:mi>x</mml:mi><mml:mo stretchy="false">^</mml:mo></mml:mover></mml:mrow><mml:mi>i</mml:mi></mml:msub></mml:mrow></mml:mstyle></mml:math></inline-formula> and <inline-formula><mml:math id="inf2"><mml:mstyle displaystyle="true" scriptlevel="0"><mml:mrow><mml:msub><mml:mrow><mml:mover><mml:mi>y</mml:mi><mml:mo stretchy="false">^</mml:mo></mml:mover></mml:mrow><mml:mi>i</mml:mi></mml:msub></mml:mrow></mml:mstyle></mml:math></inline-formula> are the predicted coordinates for the <italic>i</italic>-th test sample, and <inline-formula><mml:math id="inf3"><mml:mstyle displaystyle="true" scriptlevel="0"><mml:mrow><mml:msub><mml:mi>x</mml:mi><mml:mi>i</mml:mi></mml:msub></mml:mrow></mml:mstyle></mml:math></inline-formula> and <inline-formula><mml:math id="inf4"><mml:mstyle displaystyle="true" scriptlevel="0"><mml:mrow><mml:msub><mml:mi>y</mml:mi><mml:mi>i</mml:mi></mml:msub></mml:mrow></mml:mstyle></mml:math></inline-formula> are the target coordinates. <inline-formula><mml:math id="inf5"><mml:mstyle displaystyle="true" scriptlevel="0"><mml:mrow><mml:mrow><mml:mo stretchy="false">|</mml:mo></mml:mrow><mml:mrow><mml:mo stretchy="false">|</mml:mo></mml:mrow><mml:mspace width="1em"/><mml:mrow><mml:mo stretchy="false">|</mml:mo></mml:mrow><mml:mrow><mml:mo stretchy="false">|</mml:mo></mml:mrow></mml:mrow></mml:mstyle></mml:math></inline-formula> represents <italic>L</italic><sup>2</sup>-norm, <italic>N</italic> and is the number of samples in the test set. For the Bayesian decoder, we computed the MSE between the center of the target region and the predicted region.</p><p>We used mini-batch gradient descent with weight decay and momentum to train the network. The batch size was 100 and the learning was stopped after 100 epochs. For each session, we created 10 sets of trials, each consisting of an equal number of left and right choice trials. We used 75% of the trials in each set to train the network and the remaining 25% to evaluate the model. The reported prediction error for each session was the average of the errors computed for each of the 10 test sets.</p></sec><sec id="s4-4"><title>Downsampling and greedy selection</title><p>To compute the reconstruction error versus the number of cells in the data, we created different datasets, each containing a subset of cells. The number of cells in these sets ranged from 4 to 40 by increments of 4. For each set size, we created 5 different datasets by sampling cells randomly. These steps resulted in 50 datasets, consisting of 10 different set sizes and 5 different cell sets for each size. The process for evaluating each set is the same as that described above. In order to determine the best set of cells for the decoding, we used the forward feature selection algorithm to choose the best set of 20 cells for decoding position. In this approach, the best set of cells is initially empty. We iterated over all the cells to find the cell that will result in the lowest error if is added to the current best set of cells. This cell is then added to the current best set. These steps are repeated until the best set reaches the desired cardinality. In order to determine the error for each candidate set, we used the same procedure described in the previous section (average of 10 sets of randomly selected trials).</p></sec><sec id="s4-5"><title>Error map construction</title><p>For each session, we created 10 different datasets, consisting of an equal number of right and left choice trials. We used 75% of the trials in each dataset as the training set and the remaining 25% as the test set. After training the network on each training set, we decoded the location of the rat for the corresponding test set. In the next step, we discretized the space into tiles of 4 by 3 cm, and for each test trial computed the maximum reconstruction error when the rat was in a particular tile. The error map for each session was constructed by taking the average of the maximum reconstruction error values over trials. The final map is constructed by averaging error maps of all sessions.</p></sec><sec id="s4-6"><title>Determining the reward and choice encoding cells</title><p>To determine which cells encoded information about reward or choice, we computed the average firing rate of all cells per trial in a 1.5 s window beginning immediately after reward delivery at the north feeders, so as to create an <italic>m</italic> by <italic>n</italic> matrix, where <italic>m</italic> is the number of cells and <italic>n</italic> is the number of trials. The target associated with each column of this matrix was a binary value that represented different conditions of the parameter of interest (right/left for choice, high/low for reward). For each parameter of interest, we created 50 random sets of trials, each one containing an equal number of trials with different conditions. We used 75% of the trials in each set as the training data and the remaining 25% as the test data. We fit a logistic regression model with norm-1 regularization (Lasso) and a maximum degree of freedom of 20 to each training set. Models with different degrees of freedom were trained using 5-fold cross-validation. For each set, we picked the model that resulted in the best prediction accuracy of the target based on the neural vectors, and then logged the cells that were assigned non-zero weights (e.g. they provide useful information for discrimination). To ensure that the selected cells were meaningful, we evaluated the accuracy of the model on the test data. In our experiments, the accuracy of the final model was always above 90%. Finally, we computed the percentage of times (out of the 50 sets) each cell was assigned a non-zero weight. For a value less than or equal to 30%, the cell was classified as not informative. For values greater than 30% and less than 70%, the cell was classified as relatively informative. For values greater than 70%, the cell was classified as very informative.</p></sec><sec id="s4-7"><title>Excursion detection</title><p>We increased the temporal resolution by reducing the smoothing kernel width to 120 ms and binning the resultant signal by 20 ms. All other features of the decoding network were as described above. For each session, we created 10 sets of trials by randomly selecting an equal number of left and right trials. The set size for each direction was half the minimum number of trials performed on either side. For each set, we divided the samples into two groups. The first one contained data points that fell into a time window of 1.5s after reward delivery in the selected trials. All the other samples from the set were assigned to the second group. We used the samples in the second group to train the decoder network, and then used the network to predict the location of the rat from the samples in the first group. We marked each test trial as a excursion trial if the maximum error between the decoded position and the actual location of the rat was greater than 70 cm during that trial. The statistics we report in this paper were computed by taking the average of the results we obtained on each set of test trials.</p></sec><sec id="s4-8"><title>Identifying excursion-related cells</title><p>We divided the samples in each test set created for excursion detection into two categories. The first category contained all excursion samples that fell into a window of 80 ms, centered at time at which the distance between the actual location of the rat and the predicted location was at its peak. The second category contained all the other samples. We computed the average firing rate of the cells per category, and applied a square root transformation to convert the activity distribution into a normal distribution. We then used a t-test with a significance level of 0.01 to detect the cells that had significantly different firing rates under the two conditions. We computed the percentage of time each cell was selected among cells with significantly different firing rate and used the same procedure described above to classify cells into three levels of importance.</p></sec><sec id="s4-9"><title>Adding noise, shuffling data, and constructing confusion matrices</title><p>Confusion matrices show the probabilities of assigning patterns to correct and incorrect categories. We preprocessed neural data as for the detection of excursions. The spike data was smoothed for each session using a Gaussian kernel of width 120 ms, and then binned by 20 ms. We selected two sets of data from each trial of the task: the set containing all the samples that fell into a window of 750 ms after the off-set of the center feeder; and the set of all data points that fell into a window of 1500 ms after the off-set of the selected side feeder. Each sample was labeled based on the feeder associated with it (right/left/center).</p><p>To create a noisy dataset, we concatenated the sets associated with each feeder and computed the standard deviation of the inter-spike intervals of each neuron for each feeder. Then, we shifted spike times in each feeder set by values that were randomly drawn from Gaussian distribution with zero mean and a variance equal to 25% of the cell’s firing interval variance in that set.</p><p>To create the shuffled dataset, we concatenated all the selected time windows for all the feeders and computed the inter-spike intervals for each neuron. Then we created a new spike time-series by randomly permuting the inter-spike intervals. The label of each time-point in the shuffled dataset was the same as the label of that time point in the original dataset.</p><p>To obtain a confusion matrix for each dataset, we performed the following procedure: we randomly selected an equal number of left and right trials and used the samples from the selected trials in the original data set to train a neural network classifier. The architecture of the classifier was identical to the network that was used for decoding position, except for the output layer, which had 3 units (to represent the three feeders) and a softmax activation function. For each dataset (original/ noisy/ shuffled) we used the samples from the remaining trials as the test set and computed the normalized confusion matrix. We repeated this process 10 times for each session, and computed the average classification accuracy of these repetitions. The reported results represent the average over all sessions.</p></sec><sec id="s4-10"><title>Discrimination analysis of excursion patterns</title><p>From each dataset created for excursion detection, we created a new dataset by performing the following steps. For the trials without excursion, we computed the mean firing rate of each neuron during a window of 0-1.5 s after the feeder was closed. For the trials with excursion, we computed the average firing rate of the neurons in a window of 100 ms, centered at the time at which the excursion was at maximum departure from the actual location of the rat. Then, we assigned a label to each one of these vectors: normal pattern at feeder A (A), excursion pattern at feeder A (A’), normal pattern at feeder B (B), excursion pattern at feeder B (B’). To differentiate between normal and excursion patterns at each feeder (A vs A’ and B vs B’), we used a decision tree with a maximum number of splits of 10. To separate the excursion patterns at different feeders, we used an SVM classifier with a linear kernel. Because the number of samples was unequal among the classes, we used the area under the curve (AUC) of the receiver operator characteristic (ROC) as a measure of pattern separability.</p></sec></sec></body><back><sec id="s6" sec-type="additional-information"><title>Additional information</title><fn-group content-type="competing-interest"><title>Competing

Your article has been reviewed by two peer reviewers, and the evaluation has been overseen by Timothy Behrens as Reviewing and Senior Editor. The reviewers have opted to remain anonymous.</p><p>After discussion between the reviewers and myself, we would like to invite a revision of the manuscript. As you will see below, though, there are some criticisms of the decoding which are pretty central to the message of the paper, so it is very important that they are dealt with carefully and clearly before we could consider publication.</p><p>Summary:</p><p>The manuscript contains two novel sets of findings in an effort/reward maze task. First that spatial location can be decoded from ACC/mPFC ensembles. Second that when an error is made, and the animal discovers they are at the wrong feeder, the ensemble encodes the location of the alternative (rewarded) needed. This second finding is particularly interesting as it sits within a literature that implicates ACC activity in behavioural change but delivers new detail about the content of the activity that promotes this change in behaviour. The reviewers (and editor) were therefore enthusiastic about the findings.</p><p>Essential revisions:</p><p>The first set of essential revisions pertain to the critical decoding of the alternative feeder.</p><p>1a) The main issue relates to problems with the way the decoding results are interpreted. The authors have not done sufficient work to demonstrate that the 'teleportation' effect is not an artifact of decoding errors given the way the cells respond around the feeders. The predictions are worse around the feeders, even when the rats are at feeders. Firing around the feeders is more spatially diffuse and from the examples, cells respond at multiple feeder locations. Teleportation is a decoding error. Given these properties of the neurons, the most common type of decoding error around a feeder will be the other feeder location. As far as I can tell these are not switches between feeder-specific patterns, but it is simply that if you force a decision, the most likely error will be around the other feeder.</p><p>1b) Another type of error that I am less concerned about is that because the neurons seem to fire more around feeders, the neural net could interpret any elevation in firing as a feeder location, if decisions are forced. This is probably not so much of an issue, but it again illustrates the main problem that the reader really has no idea how the errors occur.</p><p>1 overall) To make a teleportation claim, the authors would need to show that: (1) The two feeder locations are associated with statistically different ensemble patterns. These need to be evaluated relative to all the other patterns associated with all the other location specific patterns as well as various shuffled patterns. (2) That there is switching between the two statistically different feeder patterns after reward. (3) That there is a relative absence of switching to the other statistically different patterns that are associated with all the other non-rewarded maze locations.</p><p>There were also some more minor concerns about the decoding of spatial location.</p><p>2) On the other hand, the fine-grained encoding of spatial location is quite remarkable for mPFC ensembles. This finding seems less problematic, although it would also benefit from a more rigorous approach. How good is decoding on a lap by lap basis? Is decoding so good because the feeder representations are so diffuse relative to the size of the maze? The authors should comment on whether they would expect such good decoding in the absence of feeders or on a much larger maze.</p><p>The second set of concerns relates to how the ACC decoding relates to behave.</p><p>3) Second, I found it hard to work out exactly how the rats were performing and how the analyses related precisely to what the animals were doing. There is a description of the different blocks (Figure 1B) and the mention of &quot;choice biases&quot; (Introduction), but for instance no basic description of overall performance. How many trials / sessions were there for these rats? What choices did they make and how consistent was their choice performance across the session? And how does this relate to the decoding accuracy? For instance, on choice trials, did the alternate feeder decoding accuracy correlate with performance on trial t+1? Are there differences across the block of forced trials when there is a change of value that also results in a change in preference? Other studies (e.g., Hillman and Bilkey) have suggested that ACC cells only care about situations where there is cost-benefit conflict – i.e., there is a need to overcome greater cost to achieve a greater reward.</p><p>4) I think the data in Figure 3C might be really interesting, but I couldn't work out at all what the 7 depicted points actually were. Similarly, it is described in the text that &quot;many cells involved in the excursion also encoded reward value and/or choice&quot; – but it is not clear what counts as &quot;many&quot; and the division into &quot;relatively&quot; or &quot;very&quot; important seemed arbitrary and unnecessary. There are also lots of passing mentions of task elements or analyses that are not described. For instance, there is mention of a central feeder, but I couldn't find a description of how much reward was delivered there or even whether it was delivered on every trial. This is important as those control analyses (e.g., Figure 3B, Introduction) rely on this feeder being an equivalently salient location where presumably the animal also pauses to consume the reward.</p><p>5) In general, tightening up the link between the ACC decoding and what the rats were doing would potentially really strengthen the findings.</p><p>Lastly, there was a general feeling from the reviewers and editor that the manuscript should be written in a more sober tone. This is most clearly expressed in the following 2 comments.</p><p>6) I felt the framing of the whole paper was unnecessarily hyperbolic. The first sentence of the Abstract states that &quot;Humans have known for thousands of years that the recall of multimodal information can be greatly facilitated by imagining the location associated with it&quot;. Thousands of years? What does this actually mean? Then the first main paragraph (Introduction) describes literature on ACC, the control of memory retrieval, cost-benefit outcomes, regret and particularly the function of the default mode network. However, this doesn't really line up. The medial frontal focus of the default mode is generally in rostral and ventromedial parts of medial frontal cortex (the recording site here looks about the least activated part of the rat default mode in the Lu et al., 2012 paper), the reward-guided literature is focused mainly on dorsal ACC, and the cited memory retrieval paper examines an area that looks to me like adjacent secondary motor cortex rather than ACC proper. Also, the emphasis on &quot;regret&quot; and &quot;regretful situations&quot; really isn't supported by any rigorous evidence. Just because the effect occurs on free choice trials when they choose the on average less preferred option does not automatically confer that the rats must be regretting the choice, particularly as the effect is still present on forced choice trials where there was no other option.</p><p>What is particularly frustrating about this is that I don't see any reason to try to oversell the finding by surrounding it in this vague and overblown terminology. The basic effect – of representing a potential alternative outcome at the time of reward collection – is very neat and fits well with the wider literature of this region in encoding the value of doing alternative courses of action and updating internal models of the environment.</p><p>[Editors' note: further revisions were requested prior to acceptance, as described below.]</p><p>Thank you for submitting your article &quot;Anterior cingulate cortex mentally teleports to preferred reward locations after reinforcements elsewhere&quot; for consideration by <italic>eLife</italic>. Your article has been reviewed by two peer reviewers, and the evaluation has been overseen by a Reviewing Editor and Timothy Behrens as the Senior Editor. The reviewers have opted to remain anonymous.</p><p>The reviewers have discussed the reviews with one another and the Reviewing Editor has drafted this decision to help you prepare a revised submission.</p><p>I'm afraid the key point that the reviewers raised last time is not well addressed in the eyes of the reviewers. It is still unclear whether the decoding to the new feeder position is driven by the activity that is common between the two feeders. Reviewer 2 goes into some detail about this point below and I have read through the argument and it seems a strong one to me. Below, reviewer 2 has suggested a number of tests that would be more convincing. In discussion we thought the fairest thing was to give you a final chance to address this point.</p><p>Reviewer #1:</p><p>I think the revised manuscript is more tightly focused and improved. The findings are potentially very interesting.</p><p>While I understand that the authors would have liked to make a stronger connection between behaviour and physiology but maybe cannot given the task design, I would nonetheless like just a bit more data just to show that the animals are performing the task at all as you'd expect. For instance, it's stated that the rats chose one option on ~88% of free choice trials, but it's not as far as I could see stated what these choices were. This is important given the high reward side switches at block 4 in Figure 1B and also there are some blocks where it is straightforward to determine what to do (HR/LE v LR/LE or LR/HE v HR/HE) and others where the contingencies are mixed. Could a summary of the behavioural performance in the 2 rats / 7 sessions analysed for teleportation events be included as part of Figure 1 perhaps?</p><p>I also still was a bit confused by what is now Figure 4A. If the data are the averages from each of the 7 sessions, what is &quot;the feeder&quot; (as in &quot;preference for the feeder in free-choice trials&quot; on the x-axis in 4A)? And why, if the data are averages, are there some sessions with very strong/weak preferences for &quot;the feeder&quot; (i.e., &lt; 25% or &gt; 75%) when the animals always had a strong preference in a block? Does that mean in some sessions animals were seldom choosing the other feeder at all in spite of the difference in values?</p><p>Reviewer #3:</p><p>The authors did not adequately address my concerns from the last round. The main point is that the two feeder locations are different in that they have different x-y values but similar in that they both deliver reward and the neurons encode both sources of information. That means that if you set up an analysis to search for differences (e.g. LDA), the activity around the feeders will appear to be different. On the other hand, the most common decoding errors ('teleportations') will reflect the similarities. The new controls they provided do not get at this issue.</p><p>1) In response to my critiques, the authors show a single LDA panel. LDA finds the most discriminating axes and since the authors showed that the networks strongly encode spatial information, LDA presumably separated the 3 feeder locations based on location-related activity. The LDA figure is therefore just another demonstration of what they already showed in Figure 2. The new controls are of little value (see point 3). The authors need to show that the isolated location representations actually shift independent from the contaminating influence of the common reward-related representations. Admittedly, this will be difficult because (in the Introduction) &quot;Our analysis revealed that many cells involved in the excursion also encoded reward value and/or choice information&quot;. If single neurons or the network as a whole encodes both spatial and reward information, the dNN will learn this. As a result, a decoding error is not really an error or a teleportation but the dNN indicating that part of the input is reward related and that part of the input is common to the two feeders. The relative degrees to which spatial and reward information is present likely varies from trial to trial and &quot;teleportations&quot; may be the trials where there is a more reward-like input pattern than a location-like input pattern. The authors therefore need to come up with clever ways to parse the spatial and reward signals. Since single neurons encode both reward and location, extracting neurons is not a solution. Instead, the authors could potentially use the LDA for this. Assuming the LDA axes in Figure 3 are oriented to maximally separate activity based on location (please check if this is correct), activity on 'teleportation' trials could be projected onto these axes. The points from the blue feeder trials should then fall into the red cluster and vice versa. Furthermore, the likelihood of finding a 'blue' point in the red cluster on teleportation trials should be much higher than the likelihood of finding a non-feeder point in the red cluster. If the authors do not like this solution, they could implement some other means to first parse out the contribution of reward encoding before using the dNN or to show that just the isolated spatial representations shifts while the rat is stationary at a feeder.</p><p>Also, as I asked in the last round, please show a complete error map across the entire maze at a spatial resolution like that shown in Figure 2. If the rat is at the feeder on a test trial the distribution of predicted locations should be localized around the other feeder. Again, this is probably because the dNN is picking up on common reward-related activity, but this map would still be useful.</p><p>2) I still have some trouble with the precision of the spatial encoding, given the limited training data. Since these neurons have low firing rates and are inconsistent, with such limited training data most of the ~5cm locations that were accurately decoded would never be associated with any activity, let alone consistent activity. The precise spatial encoding may instead be an artifact of how the spiking data was pre-processed. In subsection “Decoding ensemble activity” the authors state that they smoothed the data with a kernel having a s.d. of 150ms and then binned at 50ms prior to performing a square root transform. This would smear out the temporal and spatial inconsistencies in the raw data. By eliminating the inherent trial-to-trial and bin-to-bin inconsistencies and filling-in sections of the maze where no activity was present, the pre-processing may have essentially created a highly continuous and repeatable activity mosaic across the maze. Please repeat the spatial decoding analyses using the raw binned data.</p><p>3) I do not understand the 'similarity' controls. The noise procedures are of limited value since any information on this timescale is completely occluded by the pre-processing. Second, it begs the question of how much noise is useful to make the point? Too much and all decoding would break down, too little and the dNN would be robust to it. Again, the critical control is to extract just the spatial representation components and show that they shift back and forth when the rat is at one feeder.</p><p>4) In the Introduction the authors discuss the impact of preferences because of unequal effort-reward utilities. First, I am unclear how the unique blocks (subsection “Data collection”) and forced/free trials impacted the selection of training/test trials. If the reward magnitudes do not match there would be less excursions given the decreased (although still not zero) similarity in the reward representations. Second, Figure 4A would only be valid if the neurons and the dNN had the same exposure to the two feeders for the same reason that more training data improves classification.</p><p>[Editors' note: further revisions were requested prior to acceptance, as described below.]</p><p>Thank you for resubmitting your work entitled &quot;Rat anterior cingulate cortex recalls features of remote reward locations after disfavoured reinforcements&quot; for further consideration at <italic>eLife</italic>. Your revised article has been favorably evaluated by Timothy Behrens (Senior editor), a Reviewing editor, and one reviewer.</p><p>Tim Behrens sent this back to reviewer 3 and looked at it himself. Both agree the manuscript is much improved, but there are a few remaining changes that we would like you to make, detailed below.</p><p>1) Soften the language about a lack of similarity between feeder representations. The Abstract highlights the multi-plexing of reward and position representations and Figure 4 shows there are a separable reward and position components during excursions. Yet the Results are written as if to completely disregard this possibility. For example:</p><p>Subsection “Excursions of spatial encoding from the physical position to a feeder”: These analyses do not provide evidence that the excursions are not due to similarity at the feeders. LDA only finds the most discriminating axes and says nothing about other dimensions in which the feeder representations could be similar.</p><p>Subsection “Excursions of spatial encoding from the physical position to a feeder”: An AUC of 0.75 does not provide convincing evidence &quot;that the excursion patterns are not generated from a common state&quot; in spite of the classifier &quot;that they sometimes have overlapping features&quot;. Also, Figure 3H is not helpful and needs to be replaced with actual data.</p><p>In these places and throughout the manuscript (e.g. Discussion section) the language about a lack of similar components at the two feeders needs to be softened. It is ok that there are similarities because these similarities cannot completely explain the excursions.</p><p>2) The discussion of shifts and remapping in the Discussion section is confusing. Isn't the situation the same as in the present study whereby there are changes in the ensemble that vary in magnitude across cells? I am not sure how dimensionality reduction plays into all this. Furthermore, Rich and Shapiro used a correlation matrix of ensemble activity on different trials, which is not really a dimensionality reduction technique. Likewise, Ma states: &quot;Multivariate analyses were always performed in the full multidimensional space, but for the purpose of visualization, N-dimensional population vectors were projected down into a 3D space by means of metric multidimensional scaling.&quot; I have no idea what the authors are trying to say in this section.</p><p>3) There should be some discussion about why there are no excursions to the central feeder on non-preferred trials.</p></body></sub-article><sub-article article-type="reply" id="SA2"><front-stub><article-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.29793.013</article-id><title-group><article-title>Author response</article-title></title-group></front-stub><body><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Summary:</p><p>The manuscript contains two novel sets of findings in an effort/reward maze task. First that spatial location can be decoded from ACC/mPFC ensembles. Second that when an error is made, and the animal discovers they are at the wrong feeder, the ensemble encodes the location of the alternative (rewarded) needed. This second finding is particularly interesting as it sits within a literature that implicates ACC activity in behavioural change but delivers new detail about the content of the activity that promotes this change in behaviour. The reviewers (and editor) were therefore enthusiastic about the findings.</p><p>Essential revisions:</p><p>The first set of essential revisions pertain to the critical decoding of the alternative feeder.</p><p>1a) The main issue relates to problems with the way the decoding results are interpreted. The authors have not done sufficient work to demonstrate that the 'teleportation' effect is not an artifact of decoding errors given the way the cells respond around the feeders. The predictions are worse around the feeders, even when the rats are at feeders. Firing around the feeders is more spatially diffuse and from the examples, cells respond at multiple feeder locations. Teleportation is a decoding error. Given these properties of the neurons, the most common type of decoding error around a feeder will be the other feeder location. As far as I can tell these are not switches between feeder-specific patterns, but it is simply that if you force a decision, the most likely error will be around the other feeder.</p><p>1b) Another type of error that I am less concerned about is that because the neurons seem to fire more around feeders, the neural net could interpret any elevation in firing as a feeder location, if decisions are forced. This is probably not so much of an issue, but it again illustrates the main problem that the reader really has no idea how the errors occur.</p><p>1 overall) To make a teleportation claim, the authors would need to show that: (1) The two feeder locations are associated with statistically different ensemble patterns. These need to be evaluated relative to all the other patterns associated with all the other location specific patterns as well as various shuffled patterns. (2) That there is switching between the two statistically different feeder patterns after reward. (3) That there is a relative absence of switching to the other statistically different patterns that are associated with all the other non-rewarded maze locations.</p></disp-quote><p>This is an excellent point, and we apologize for not addressing it adequately in the first draft. This has been our primary concern for the past 18 months since we first found the teleportations. We have undertaken several approaches to convince ourselves that the phenomenon is real and not a methodological artifact. We now include this evidence so as to support our claim that this is a neurobiological phenomenon. I would like to first point out that I suspect that our initial presentation of the mean MAXIMUM error was causing confusion and/or skepticism. We have heavily edited the manuscript and added figure panels to present the evidence as follows:</p><p>1) The mean and median prediction error is very good across the entire maze – feeder and non-feeder alike. We show this now in two panels. Figure 2F shows all of the ‘instantaneous’ (50ms) errors as a function of linearized position to illustrate that the mean accuracy is very good at the feeders. It is the distribution of the outliers that is unique at the feeders. This can be seen in the one session data (2F), and the new population averaged data in 2G.</p><p>2) We now show (new figure panel 3E) that linear discriminate analysis (LDA) produces clusters of the neural patterns recorded from the feeders. This is graphical evidence that is independent from our decoding network. This shows that linear combinations of neural activity can separate the patterns.</p><p>3) LDA is linear and could miss non-linear interactions that contain information. In order to not constrain methods to linear combinations, we used a 3-layer neural network to classify the patterns of activity at the feeders. We then quantified the classification error for all possible combinations. This resulting plot of classifications is commonly called a ‘confusion matrix’, which we show in Figure 3F. We show a statistical comparison of these summed errors in panel Figure 3G. This shows that the accuracy is very high in the original data, and that moderate noise by spike shuffling does not decrease the accuracy whereas full shuffling does drastically decrease accuracy. If the teleportation events were due to similarity of patterned neural activity, this shuffling should cause an increase in the number of errors.</p><p>4) To recap, there are 4 new key pieces of evidence in the manuscript: (1) the dANN clearly separates the patterns at feeders by assigning them to well-separated spatial positions, (2) the LDA shows pattern separation, (3) a separate classifier network also shows excellent accuracy, and (4) moderate levels of spike shuffling do not increase errors. A fifth piece of evidence is the fact that the teleportations occur over several time bins and last longer than the smoothing kernel, which would be exceedingly unlikely to occur by chance. This evidence is outlined in a new paragraph in the Introduction.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>There were also some more minor concerns about the decoding of spatial location.</p><p>2) On the other hand, the fine-grained encoding of spatial location is quite remarkable for mPFC ensembles. This finding seems less problematic, although it would also benefit from a more rigorous approach. How good is decoding on a lap by lap basis? Is decoding so good because the feeder representations are so diffuse relative to the size of the maze? The authors should comment on whether they would expect such good decoding in the absence of feeders or on a much larger maze.</p></disp-quote><p>Thank you for pointing this out. We now show all errors for one session (Figure 2F). We had already shown the prediction error for two laps of the task (Figure 2C). We provide some evidence that these are representative laps by indicating the prediction error of these two laps on the cumulative distribution of error – the blue lap is slightly less than the median, and the black is somewhat higher than the median (because of the log scale). We also now show the mean prediction error across all sessions in Figure 2G. We hope that this reduces confusion about the maximal error, shown in the lower graphic in this panel. The maximum is averaging the outliers, as seen in Figure 2F. These data show that the goodness of prediction is independent of location and occupancy of position (because the plots are normalized by time and space). So, the prediction accuracy is not strongly influenced by the rats’ occupancy of the feeder zones.</p><p>We further now report that adding noise to the spike times has a small effect on the accuracy of the position decoding (Introduction) and show the data in Figure 2C. This shows that the encoder is robust against noise. We want to point out that we have taken pains to cross-validate all of the decoding models by training and testing on separate portions of the data so as to avoid ‘overfitting’. This part of our approach is what allows the network to be robust against noise.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>The second set of concerns relates to how the ACC decoding relates to behave.</p><p>3) Second, I found it hard to work out exactly how the rats were performing and how the analyses related precisely to what the animals were doing. There is a description of the different blocks (Figure 1B) and the mention of &quot;choice biases&quot; (Introduction), but for instance no basic description of overall performance. How many trials / sessions were there for these rats? What choices did they make and how consistent was their choice performance across the session? And how does this relate to the decoding accuracy? For instance, on choice trials, did the alternate feeder decoding accuracy correlate with performance on trial t+1? Are there differences across the block of forced trials when there is a change of value that also results in a change in preference? Other studies (e.g., Hillman and Bilkey) have suggested that ACC cells only care about situations where there is cost-benefit conflict – i.e., there is a need to overcome greater cost to achieve a greater reward.</p></disp-quote><p>We have now included quantitative detail on the behavioural performance – particularly the number of trials (Introduction) and the bias of the rats (Introduction).</p><p>The second part of this comment hits on a potentially important aspect of the phenomenon- how does it influence behaviour. We tried to answer this question, but the design of the task presents insurmountable problems. In short, the task was not designed to test this. Roughly two thirds of the trials are forced alternating choice and can be fully predicted by the rat. This raises the possibility of spurious correlations in trial-by-trial analysis. For instance, on two thirds of the trials, the current neural activity is highly correlated with the current choice, the past choice, and the future choices (because of the alternation in forced choice). We did analyze whether neural activity was predictive of past or future choice, reward or effort, and found that it was as shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="respfig1">Author response image 1</xref>:</p><fig id="respfig1"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.29793.010</object-id><label>Author response image 1.</label><caption/><graphic mime-subtype="jpeg" mimetype="image" xlink:href="elife-29793-resp-fig1-v2"/></fig><p>However, we are not confident that these correlations would hold under a different choice schedule. Furthermore, the rats were descending a ramp on the side arms of the track when the platform was elevated, so some of the effort encoding could be related to mortoric differences in navigating different declines. For these reasons, we omitted neural correlates across forced-choice trials.</p><p>The 10 forced-choice trials were followed by 6 free-choice trials, in which the rat had very strong feeder preference. This led to very few trials in which the rat freely chose the less-preferred option. We therefore do not have sufficient data to address whether the teleportation is indicative of future behaviour. This is a very important question, and the focus of our ongoing experiments.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>4) I think the data in Figure 3C might be really interesting, but I couldn't work out at all what the 7 depicted points actually were. Similarly, it is described in the text that &quot;many cells involved in the excursion also encoded reward value and/or choice&quot; – but it is not clear what counts as &quot;many&quot; and the division into &quot;relatively&quot; or &quot;very&quot; important seemed arbitrary and unnecessary. There are also lots of passing mentions of task elements or analyses that are not described. For instance, there is mention of a central feeder, but I couldn't find a description of how much reward was delivered there or even whether it was delivered on every trial. This is important as those control analyses (e.g., Figure 3B, Introduction) rely on this feeder being an equivalently salient location where presumably the animal also pauses to consume the reward.</p></disp-quote><p>The figure panel in question (now Figure 4A in the revised manuscript) is important. Each data point is the average of data from one session. It shows that teleportation events are more likely to occur at one feeder, and that this bias negatively correlates with the revealed preference for that feeder (the percentage of times the rat chose that feeder in free-choice trials). We realize that the symbolic representation in axis labels were difficult to understand, and so have relabeled them with descriptions that are hopefully more understandable.</p><p>We also now describe the central feeder in the main text, and state that rats get the small reward every time at this feeder. The reward saliency of this feeder should be on par with the choice feeders.</p><p>The determination of whether cells are important for conveying information about reward value and/or choice is difficult to quantify with methods commonly used in neuroscience. The teleportation events are very brief, we only have two levels of choice and reward, and each neuron can encode several variables (or their interaction). Moreover, the low number of trials relative to the variance of activation is not well-suited to linear models such as ANOVA. We therefore undertook a bootstrapping approach (which is a common method for determining confidence intervals) to determine how often a particular cell would be selected as an informative input by a classification algorithm. A better approach would be to test all combinations of cells in order to identify which were needed for the discrimination and the relative information contained by each. This is not computationally tractable, and so we report the frequency that each cell is selected. This is a common approach in machine learning. Nonetheless, the categories are indeed arbitrary. The obvious approach is to plot the actual proportion of trials that each cell was selected, but it then becomes very difficult to see which are jointly encoding information. We therefore left the color scheme discretized into three levels but change the description in the caption and the text to indicate that we are showing how ‘informative’ the cell is for discriminating the feature of interest, rather than its ‘importance’. The threshold for the three levels is arbitrary, but the results are not qualitatively affected very strongly by assigning different thresholds. We do not make any claims as to how frequently neurons jointly encode features, and therefore argue that our approach reasonable.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>5) In general, tightening up the link between the ACC decoding and what the rats were doing would potentially really strengthen the findings.</p></disp-quote><p>We very much agree. We have done this in the spatial domain, but as stated above, our hands are tied by the choice schedule (forced alternation). We can indeed find strong correlations, but we are not able to parse out what is because of the deterministic nature of two thirds of the trials (forced-choice), and the strong bias in choices in the remaining trials (free-choice).</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Lastly, there was a general feeling from the reviewers and editor that the manuscript should be written in a more sober tone. This is most clearly expressed in the following 2 comments.</p><p>6) I felt the framing of the whole paper was unnecessarily hyperbolic. The first sentence of the Abstract states that &quot;Humans have known for thousands of years that the recall of multimodal information can be greatly facilitated by imagining the location associated with it&quot;. Thousands of years? What does this actually mean? Then the first main paragraph (Introduction) describes literature on ACC, the control of memory retrieval, cost-benefit outcomes, regret and particularly the function of the default mode network. However, this doesn't really line up. The medial frontal focus of the default mode is generally in rostral and ventromedial parts of medial frontal cortex (the recording site here looks about the least activated part of the rat default mode in the Lu et al., 2012 paper), the reward-guided literature is focused mainly on dorsal ACC, and the cited memory retrieval paper examines an area that looks to me like adjacent secondary motor cortex rather than ACC proper. Also, the emphasis on &quot;regret&quot; and &quot;regretful situations&quot; really isn't supported by any rigorous evidence. Just because the effect occurs on free choice trials when they choose the on average less preferred option does not automatically confer that the rats must be regretting the choice, particularly as the effect is still present on forced choice trials where there was no other option.</p><p>What is particularly frustrating about this is that I don't see any reason to try to oversell the finding by surrounding it in this vague and overblown terminology. The basic effect – of representing a potential alternative outcome at the time of reward collection – is very neat and fits well with the wider literature of this region in encoding the value of doing alternative courses of action and updating internal models of the environment.</p></disp-quote><p>We appreciate these comments and have edited the manuscript extensively to make it more sober. The focus of the introduction is now shifted away from default mode networks and regret, to the formation of schema (models), representation of space, and control of actions. We address a few of the specific comments through the following:</p><p>1) Regret: this term has been removed from the manuscript except for one reference to literature.</p><p>2) Default mode network: there is no longer any mention of this in the Introduction. We agree that present data are not sufficient to make any specific claims about the DMN. We do, however, point out in the discussion that the teleportation phenomenon reported here occurs at a time (post-reward) in which replay of events has been reported in other structures (hippocampus, OFC). We do observe that the timing is consistent with that of the default mode network, and speculate that the dynamics of the teleportation/replay events could be a simplified version of that in humans supporting cognition. This is clearly stated as speculation, and therefore feel it is appropriate near the end of the paper. The reason we do so is because the present evidence showing intermixing of a spatial map with other information that could be considered part of the cognitive map. We are unaware of other evidence of such mixing with similar resolution, and this part of the discussion could help readers in other fields relate to the findings.</p><p>3) Memory retrieval: We argue that evidence does suggest that the ACC is involved in memory retrieval and the formation of world models (schema). The Rajasethupathy et al., 2015 study shows fluoresence in the dorsal medial PFC reasonably close to where we have recorded. We have now added descriptions and citations to two other papers regarding the role of ACC in the control of memory and formaiton of shema: (1) Ito HT, Zhang et al., (2015); and (2) Wang, Tseand Morris, (2012).</p><p>[Editors' note: further revisions were requested prior to acceptance, as described below.]</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Reviewer #1:</p><p>I think the revised manuscript is more tightly focused and improved. The findings are potentially very interesting.</p><p>While I understand that the authors would have liked to make a stronger connection between behaviour and physiology but maybe cannot given the task design, I would nonetheless like just a bit more data just to show that the animals are performing the task at all as you'd expect. For instance, it's stated that the rats chose one option on ~88% of free choice trials, but it's not as far as I could see stated what these choices were. This is important given the high reward side switches at block 4 in Figure 1B and also there are some blocks where it is straightforward to determine what to do (HR/LE v LR/LE or LR/HE v HR/HE) and others where the contingencies are mixed. Could a summary of the behavioural performance in the 2 rats / 7 sessions analysed for teleportation events be included as part of Figure 1 perhaps?</p></disp-quote><p>The relationships among the effort, reward, and choice (as well as neural activity) are complex, and so we are preparing another manuscript to describe them in detail. The present manuscript focuses on the subset of the data that has a sufficient number of simultaneously recorded units needed to study the spatial encoding and dynamics at reward sites. The other manuscript, which is in preparation, deals with economic choice involving effort and reward, and their neural correlates in individual cells. We feel that the behavioral effects of effort and reward belong in that manuscript rather than this one. However, to address your question, we have included <xref ref-type="fig" rid="respfig2">Author response image 2</xref> showing the influence of reward and effort on the choice of the high reward arm. The first four bars show the performance when the high reward was on one side and the last two show performance when the high reward was on the other side. The x-axis labels show the ramp height choice offered (i.e., low-high means the ramp was low for the low reward arm and high for the high reward arm). Choices are 80-90% towards the high-reward arm but drop to 40-60% when the ramp is at its highest position. Hence, both reward and effort influence choice, and require multiple analyses and plots to fully convey their relationship.</p><fig id="respfig2"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.29793.011</object-id><label>Author response image 2.</label><caption/><graphic mime-subtype="jpeg" mimetype="image" xlink:href="elife-29793-resp-fig2-v2"/></fig><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>I also still was a bit confused by what is now Figure 4A.

And why, if the data are averages, are there some sessions with very strong/weak preferences for &quot;the feeder&quot; (i.e., &lt; 25% or &gt; 75%) when the animals always had a strong preference in a block?

These are session averages for the choice feeder on the top right side of the track. We changed the text in the figure caption and the plot axes to clarify this. The data were counterbalanced for right/left selection for the spatial decoding needed for excursion detection (these are forced-selection trials), and all of the reward-effort utility combinations were present at each target feeder (but not exactly counterbalanced due to the limited number of trials available in each session). The preference measure comes from the free-selection trials. The rats sometimes had strong choice bias for the right-side feeder, and sometimes for the left.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Reviewer #3:</p><p>The authors did not adequately address my concerns from the last round. The main point is that the two feeder locations are different in that they have different x-y values but similar in that they both deliver reward and the neurons encode both sources of information. That means that if you set up an analysis to search for differences (e.g. LDA), the activity around the feeders will appear to be different. On the other hand, the most common decoding errors ('teleportations') will reflect the similarities. The new controls they provided do not get at this issue.</p><p>1) In response to my critiques, the authors show a single LDA panel. LDA finds the most discriminating axes and since the authors showed that the networks strongly encode spatial information, LDA presumably separated the 3 feeder locations based on location-related activity. The LDA figure is therefore just another demonstration of what they already showed in Figure 2. The new controls are of little value (see point 3). The authors need to show that the isolated location representations actually shift independent from the contaminating influence of the common reward-related representations. Admittedly, this will be difficult because (in the Introduction) &quot;Our analysis revealed that many cells involved in the excursion also encoded reward value and/or choice information&quot;. If single neurons or the network as a whole encodes both spatial and reward information, the dNN will learn this. As a result, a decoding error is not really an error or a teleportation but the dNN indicating that part of the input is reward related and that part of the input is common to the two feeders. The relative degrees to which spatial and reward information is present likely varies from trial to trial and &quot;teleportations&quot; may be the trials where there is a more reward-like input pattern than a location-like input pattern. The authors therefore need to come up with clever ways to parse the spatial and reward signals. Since single neurons encode both reward and location, extracting neurons is not a solution. Instead, the authors could potentially use the LDA for this. Assuming the LDA axes in Figure 3 are oriented to maximally separate activity based on location (please check if this is correct), activity on 'teleportation' trials could be projected onto these axes. The points from the blue feeder trials should then fall into the red cluster and vice versa. Furthermore, the likelihood of finding a 'blue' point in the red cluster on teleportation trials should be much higher than the likelihood of finding a non-feeder point in the red cluster. If the authors do not like this solution, they could implement some other means to first parse out the contribution of reward encoding before using the dNN or to show that just the isolated spatial representations shifts while the rat is stationary at a feeder.</p></disp-quote><p>We apologize that neither previous version of the manuscript sufficiently ruled out other possibilities for our finding that the spatial decoder sometimes shifted from the occupied feeder to the remote feeder. The reviewer suggests that the reward encoding could eclipse the spatial encoding at both choice feeders, and if the reward encoding shared similar features, the decoder could sometimes confuse the two. This is certainly a possibility that we did not adequately address previously. We have added to the manuscript a new set of analyses to test this and another possibility (Results section):</p><p>The analyses above do not rule out the possibility that the ACC activity occasionally enters a unique ‘latent state’ when the animal is at either choice feeder. For instance, the reward encoding neurons could strongly activate to overshadow the position information in some instances, and this could produce a pattern that emerges at both feeders but is distinct from the normal encoding at the feeders, and thereby confuses the decoder. We sought to test for this by computing the classification accuracy of ACC patterns among the four classes: feeder A during an excursion (A’); feeder B during an excursion (B’); feeder A not during excursion (A); and feeder B not during excursion (B). If the excursions are because of a transition to a common state from both feeders, then the excursion patterns should be highly discriminable from the non-excursion patterns at the same feeder (A’ from A, and B’ from B), but not discriminable from each other (A’ from B’). We found strong evidence for the former, but not the latter. We used the area under the curve (AUC) of the receiver operator characteristic (ROC) to quantify discriminability of samples from pairs of these conditions. An AUC value close to 0.5 indicates that the patterns from two classes are indiscriminable, whereas an AUC value close to 1 indicates that patterns are highly discriminable by the classifier. AUC values between these limits indicate that features of the patterns are sometimes similar and sometimes dissimilar in at least some dimensions. The discrimination of excursions from non-excursions at the same feeder (A’ from A, and B’ from B) was very high (AUC = 0.94). On the other hand, the patterns during the excursions from the two feeders (A’ from B’) were discriminable at a moderate level (mean AUC = 0.75). This suggests that the excursion patterns are not generated from a common state, but that they sometimes have overlapping features.</p><p>A schematic summary of the classification results is shown in Figure 3H. The non-excursion patterns (A, B) are highly discriminable (e.g. Figure 3E-G), as are the excursion patterns from the actual position of the animal (A, A’, and B, B’). The excursion patterns partially overlap with each other (A’, B’), and with the pattern from the unselected feeder (A’, B and B’, A). The latter is supported by the results of the spatial decoder. It thus appears that some features of the encoding shift to be more similar to the unselected feeder during excursion events. Because reward and location were confounded in the experimental design, we cannot rule out the possibility that reward encoding contributes to the phenomena. The inability to fully discriminate the excursion patterns from one another could involve some feature of the reward, such as volume, which flips between the choice feeders during the session.</p><p>We also note that similar features that appear at each target feeder would be mapped by the decoder network to the midway point between the feeders, because the objective function is based on distance. The midway point minimizes the error. Our data show, however, that the mapping during excursions goes to the alternate feeder rather than the midway point.</p><p>We argue that the preponderance of evidence supports our new weaker claim that the pattern of activity shifts during the excursions to often become more similar to the remote feeder than the presently occupied one. This evidence includes not only the classification analysis, but also the output of the position decoder. In particular, we would expect some excursions to begin or terminate at the starting feeder if they were driven by sensory features of reward. We have edited the discussion heavily, and now include a more sober discussion of the new claim in the Discussion section. We have also softened the tone regarding the shifting of encoding by omitting the term ‘teleportation’ and opting for ‘excursion’ form the present state. We discuss the possibility that the state more strongly resembles the remote feeder (than the occupied feeder) in spatial and possibly other dimensions. We now also point out that spontaneous reactivation of neural patterns reported in other studies often involves different numbers of spikes or a compressed time-course as compared to the patterns during the experience. This is an additional confound that may limit discriminability because the filtering and binning of spike data was set based on the experiential data and was not modified to optimize the classification analysis.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Also, as I asked in the last round, please show a complete error map across the entire maze at a spatial resolution like that shown in Figure 2. If the rat is at the feeder on a test trial the distribution of predicted locations should be localized around the other feeder. Again, this is probably because the dNN is picking up on common reward-related activity, but this map would still be useful.</p></disp-quote><p>This plot has been added.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>2) I still have some trouble with the precision of the spatial encoding, given the limited training data. Since these neurons have low firing rates and are inconsistent, with such limited training data most of the ~5cm locations that were accurately decoded would never be associated with any activity, let alone consistent activity. The precise spatial encoding may instead be an artifact of how the spiking data was pre-processed. In subsection “Decoding ensemble activity” the authors state that they smoothed the data with a kernel having a s.d. of 150ms and then binned at 50ms prior to performing a square root transform. This would smear out the temporal and spatial inconsistencies in the raw data. By eliminating the inherent trial-to-trial and bin-to-bin inconsistencies and filling-in sections of the maze where no activity was present, the pre-processing may have essentially created a highly continuous and repeatable activity mosaic across the maze. Please repeat the spatial decoding analyses using the raw binned data.</p></disp-quote><p>We interpret this concern as: the ACC is encoding only a few key positions on the task (turn here, reward there), but we are smearing these highly position-specific signals over the intervening space in the pre-processing, and so the decoding is artificially accurate because of interpolation from this smeared signal that is not present in action potentials. This is an excellent alternative hypothesis, but we think several lines of evidence indicate this is not the case. First, Fujisawa et al., (2008) show units in mPFC with position-dependent activity fields that individually span only a small fraction of the track. The centers of the spatial fields are distributed over the entire track. This suggests that there should not be any’ dark’ regions of the track that cannot be decoded directly from spikes without smoothing. We use smoothing to make up for our sampling deficit with respect to the entire ACC population. We further argue that the smoothing does not invalidate the present results for four interrelated reasons:</p><p>First: we show in Figure 1—figure supplement 1B the effect of kernel width on RMSE. The decoding RMSE was about 15cm with a 50ms width, indicating that the decoding does not fail as the kernel shrinks to near the width of the time bins used. Further, we were able to achieve similar error (as with a 150ms kernel std) with a kernel of 75ms and a different network architecture (not shown).</p><p>Second: the width of the kernel (150 ms) is 3.3% of the mean time the rat spends locomoting on the track in each lap (4.5 s). The smoothing is therefore filling only small sampling gaps with respect to the scale of the apparatus. In other words, the filter size is small with respect to the variation of activity patterns over the maze. This is corroborated by the above-mentioned plot Figure 1—figure supplement 1B. The error decreases as the size is increased to a point, and then the error begins to increase at abut 700-1000ms width. This appears to be the point at which the filter size begins to exceed the scale of pattern variation.</p><p>Third: the smoothing is performed between time bins, and not between trials. It therefore reduces bin-to-bin inconsistencies but has little effect on trial-to-trial inconsistencies. Therefore, bins beyond several standard deviations of the kernel are effectively independent, as are the same bin from trial-to-trial.</p><p>Fourth: the error was significantly increased by jittering the spike times on the order of 25 ms. This was spread out in time by the smoothing (address in more detail below), but nonetheless degraded performance. This suggests that small changes in spike timing on all parts of the track matter, which argues against the proposal that the high-resolution decoding accuracy arises from blending together unique patterns between distant (course-resolution) landmarks.</p><p>In sum, the scale of smoothing is small with respect to the variation of patterns over the apparatus (within trial), and there is no filtering across trials. Further, the decoding works well even with much smaller kernel widths. Lastly, the wide distribution of position-sensitive cells across the track in Fujisawa et al., (2008) strongly supports the notion that all track positions are encoded by some cells in ACC. We conclude that we are likely not introducing information that is not already present in the ACC population to an extent that invalidates the results.</p><p>A final point is that your question raises several deep questions for which we do not think there are precise answers. What is the appropriate granularity of time for relevance to biological neurons, and what is the nature of temporal filtering performed by neurons? The time binning operation performs a filtering operation, so our choice of bin size affects the results even if we do not use a smoothing kernel. We could conceivably create a more biologically-relevant decoder by using a short causal filter mimicking the integration of post-synaptic potentials and a recurrent network architecture, but the performance again depends on parameterization. For these reasons and the evidence that the results are not an artifact of smoothing, we don’t think that pursuing decoding with a different (nor no) smoothing kernel would benefit the present manuscript.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>3) I do not understand the 'similarity' controls. The noise procedures are of limited value since any information on this timescale is completely occluded by the pre-processing. Second, it begs the question of how much noise is useful to make the point? Too much and all decoding would break down, too little and the dNN would be robust to it. Again, the critical control is to extract just the spatial representation components and show that they shift back and forth when the rat is at one feeder.</p></disp-quote><p>What constitutes ‘small’ is certainly up for debate. We agree that too much or too little provides no information, and advocate for an empirical answer. We argue that because the amount we used degraded performance of the decoder significantly, that it is at least ‘in the ballpark’ of magnitude that is present in the data most of the time. It is true that much of the effect of the added noise will be smeared out by the pre-processing step, however the same is true for noise and random changes in the original signal. We wanted to know if these could lead to a significant proportion of large errors, as could explain the excursions.</p><p>The conclusion is that either because of the pre-processing steps or the ability of the network to separate useful information from noise, the decoder output is robust against small random changes in the signal. Therefore, large deviations in the output of the network are more likely to be due to a significant, or patterned, change in the signal. Of course, it is possible that this breaks down under higher levels of noise, network architecture, or other parameters. Rather than attempt to explore this large space, we focused on the new analysis described in above.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>4) In the Introduction the authors discuss the impact of preferences because of unequal effort-reward utilities. First, I am unclear how the unique blocks (subsection “Data collection”) and forced/free trials impacted the selection of training/test trials. If the reward magnitudes do not match there would be less excursions given the decreased (although still not zero) similarity in the reward representations. Second, Figure 4A would only be valid if the neurons and the dNN had the same exposure to the two feeders for the same reason that more training data improves classification.</p></disp-quote><p>All analysis of spatial decoding and classification used balanced data that included the same number of trials to the left and right. For the spatial decoding (Figure 1 and Figure 2), an equal number of training data are selected from the pool of all trials. The analysis in Figure 3 and Figure 4 included data selected from forced-selection trials only. Right/Left was always balanced, but we did not have sufficient data to additionally balance reward size and effort and have sufficient trials for model fitting. We would like to know if the excursion occurrence is promoted by the degree of reward or utility similarity among choices. The limitation is the estimation of internal valuation beyond choice preference. With the present task design, it would be difficult to fit a well-validated choice model. We think this is better addressed in a future experiment using less-frequent contingency shifts and a higher proportion of free-choice trials.</p><p>The analysis shown in Figure 4A does include balanced exposure to both feeders. Moreover, the high reward was sometimes at the right feeder, and sometimes the left. We altered the labels and legend to indicate that it shows choice preference and excursion probability at the right-hand feeder.</p><p>[Editors' note: further revisions were requested prior to acceptance, as described below.]</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>1) Soften the language about a lack of similarity between feeder representations. The Abstract highlights the multi-plexing of reward and position representations and Figure 4 shows there are a separable reward and position components during excursions. Yet the Results are written as if to completely disregard this possibility. For example:</p><p>Subsection “Excursions of spatial encoding from the physical position to a feeder”: These analyses do not provide evidence that the excursions are not due to similarity at the feeders. LDA only finds the most discriminating axes and says nothing about other dimensions in which the feeder representations could be similar.</p><p>Subsection “Excursions of spatial encoding from the physical position to a feeder”: An AUC of 0.75 does not provide convincing evidence &quot;that the excursion patterns are not generated from a common state&quot; in spite of the classifier &quot;that they sometimes have overlapping features&quot;. Also, Figure 3H is not helpful and needs to be replaced with actual data.</p><p>In these places and throughout the manuscript (e.g. Discussion section) the language about a lack of similar components at the two feeders needs to be softened. It is ok that there are similarities because these similarities cannot completely explain the excursions.</p></disp-quote><p>We have edited the manuscript throughout to soften the tone, including the four specific lines mentioned above. We do not argue that some features of feeder activity patterns may be similar, and instead focus on whether some features are truly different. We have omitted the statement about the excursion patterns not coming from a common state based on the 0.75 AUC and have replaced figure panel in question with actual data. The data come from a PCA of activity of a middle layer of the decoder network. We take care to point out which results come from untransformed input patterns, and which come from patterns transformed by the decoding network. The excursion patterns are only partially separated in the input patterns but become highly separated in the network. We conclude that the non-linear transformation by the network is able to separate the excursion patterns, but we cannot identify what features are used to do so. The reward may very well figure into the transform.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>2) The discussion of shifts and remapping in the Discussion section is confusing. Isn't the situation the same as in the present study whereby there are changes in the ensemble that vary in magnitude across cells? I am not sure how dimensionality reduction plays into all this. Furthermore, Rich and Shapiro used a correlation matrix of ensemble activity on different trials, which is not really a dimensionality reduction technique. Likewise, Ma states: &quot;Multivariate analyses were always performed in the full multidimensional space, but for the purpose of visualization, N-dimensional population vectors were projected down into a 3D space by means of metric multidimensional scaling.&quot; I have no idea what the authors are trying to say in this section.</p></disp-quote><p>We apologize for the confusion. The differences in methodologies was not central to the point we wanted to make – that the evidence of radical shifts of spatial encoding in mPFC may reflect a process akin to ‘global remapping’ in the hippocampus, which does not retain features of other maps in the same physical space. The current decoding approach may be helpful to assess if any associations (map features) are retained in ACC when such shifts occur.</p><p>We have edited the paragraph to read:</p><p>“These investigators proposed that this provides a shift in context so as to facilitate learning or utilizing different sets of associations (e.g. action-outcome). It remains unclear whether theses shifts are due to a global remapping of the entire ensemble or only a subset of task-relevant cells. The decoding algorithms demonstrated here may be useful for determining if schemas (a.k.a mental models or cognitive maps) retain associative information about space or other features across such shifts, or if ACC wipes the slate clean in some conditions.”</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>3) There should be some discussion about why there are no excursions to the central feeder on non-preferred trials.</p></disp-quote><p>We have added a section to discuss this in the Discussion section.</p><p>“The emergence of excursions exclusively at the target feeders, and not the center feeder, suggests a role in outcome comparison or future choice. Excursions did not terminate at the center feeder, suggesting they do not encode the subsequent action from the target feeder, which is always a return to the center feeder as enforced by gates on the track. It is possible that the excursions reflect an unexecuted plan to move from the occupied feeder to the other. If this were the case, however, we would expect to occasionally observe excursions when the rat is at the center feeder or other location on the track. A possible alternative is that the excursions reflect a mechanism for shifting strategies. The rodent ACC is involved in shifting responses (Joel et al., 1997; Birrell and Brown, 2000), and appears to sustain information over time (Dalley et al., 2004; Takehara-Nishiuchi and McNaughton, 2008). Although speculative, it is therefore possible that the excursions trigger a memory trace in ACC that promotes a response shift at the next visit to the choice point on the track. In other words, the ACC may have made a decision for the next choice while at the target feeder, which could preclude excursions at the center feeder or other intermediate point. The ACC is only one of several dissociated circuits that influence binary choice (Gruber and McDonald, 2012; Gruber et al., 2015), and is posited to bias competition among these other systems (Murray et al., 2017). Excursions may therefore have a probabilistic influence on future choice rather than fully determining it.”</p></body></sub-article></article>
