However, CRISPR arrays often exhibit unpredictable performance due to interference between multiple guide RNA (gRNAs). Here, we report that Cas12a array performance is hypersensitive to the GC content of gRNA spacers, as high-GC spacers can impair activity of the downstream gRNA. We analyze naturally occurring CRISPR arrays and observe that natural repeats always contain an AT-rich fragment that separates gRNAs, which we term a <italic>CRISPR separator</italic>. Inspired by this observation, we design short, AT-rich synthetic separators (<italic>synSeparators</italic>) that successfully remove the disruptive effects between gRNAs. We further demonstrate enhanced simultaneous activation of seven endogenous genes in human cells using an array containing the synSeparator. These results elucidate a previously underexplored feature of natural CRISPR arrays and demonstrate how nature-inspired engineering solutions can improve multi-gene control in mammalian cells.</p></abstract><kwd-group kwd-group-type="author-keywords"><kwd>CRISPR</kwd><kwd>Cas12a</kwd><kwd>multiplexed gene regulation</kwd><kwd>CRISPR array</kwd><kwd>separator</kwd><kwd>GC content</kwd><kwd>Guide RNA design</kwd><kwd>gene activation</kwd><kwd>CRISPRa</kwd><kwd>Cpf1</kwd><kwd>Cas13d</kwd><kwd>mammalian cells</kwd><kwd>human cells</kwd></kwd-group><kwd-group kwd-group-type="research-organism"><title>Research organism</title></kwd-group><funding-group><award-group id="fund1"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100007421</institution-id><institution>Li Ka Shing Foundation</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Qi</surname><given-names>Lei S</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund2"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution>NIH Common Fund 4D Nucleome Program</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>U01 DK127405</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Qi</surname><given-names>Lei S</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund3"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100000854</institution-id><institution>Human Frontier Science Program</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>Long-term Fellowship</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Magnusson</surname><given-names>Jens P</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund4"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100001727</institution-id><institution>Sweden-America Foundation</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Magnusson</surname><given-names>Jens P</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><funding-statement>The funders had no role in study design, data collection and interpretation, or the decision to submit the work for publication.</funding-statement></funding-group><custom-meta-group><custom-meta specific-use="meta-only"><meta-name>Author impact statement</meta-name><meta-value>Cas12a CRISPR arrays are sensitive to the GC content of their spacers, but AT-rich separator sequences successfully remove this disruptive effect and enable enhanced multiplexed gene targeting and activation.</meta-value></custom-meta></custom-meta-group></article-meta></front><body><sec id="s1" sec-type="intro"><title>Introduction</title><p>Precise control of cell identity and behavior will require the ability to regulate the expression of many genes simultaneously. Genes can be experimentally turned on or off using transcriptional activators or repressors attached to nuclease-deactivated Cas proteins (dCas) in technologies named CRISPRa and CRISPRi (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Lo and Qi, 2017</xref>). When this Cas fusion protein is recruited to a target gene, guided by a CRISPR-associated guide RNA (<italic>gRNA</italic> for type V CRISPR Cas12, also known as CRISPR-RNAs [crRNAs] when expressed from their native loci) or a chimeric single-guide RNA (<italic>sgRNA</italic> for type II CRISPR Cas9), the target gene can be activated or repressed. While this technology works relatively well for controlling single genes, a central goal is to efficiently control more than a handful of genes at a time for applications in cell engineering.</p><p>In their native prokaryotic context, multiple crRNAs are encoded on a CRISPR array transcribed as a single, long transcript (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Brouns et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Zetsche et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1A</xref>). Unlike the widely used Cas9, which requires a trans-activating crRNA (tracrRNA) and RNase III for maturation of its gRNA, Cas12a (also known as Cpf1) can process its own CRISPR array (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Fonfara et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Zetsche et al., 2015</xref>). Therefore, multi-gene control can be achieved experimentally with Cas12a (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">McCarty et al., 2020</xref>). This strategy has recently been used to edit or control the expression of multiple genes in human cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Breinig et al., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Campa et al., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Kleinstiver et al., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Tak et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">Zetsche et al., 2017</xref>). However, CRISPR arrays encoding multiple crRNAs often exhibit unpredictable performance for multi-gene regulation. Small-RNA-seq experiments suggest that array processing by Cas12a is uneven, such that the constituent processed gRNAs may differ 10- to 100-fold in abundance (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Campa et al., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Liao et al., 2019b</xref>). To reliably regulate many genes experimentally using this system, it will be crucial to optimize the performance of CRISPR arrays in mammalian cells and understand the principles governing CRISPR array processing.</p><fig-group><fig id="fig1" position="float"><label>Figure 1.</label><caption><title>gRNA performance is affected by the GC content of the upstream spacer.</title><p>(<bold>A</bold>) The CRISPR-Cas12a operon consists of Cas genes and a CRISPR array.

This suggests that secondary structures that involve both the dummy spacer and the GFP-targeting gRNA are particularly disruptive.</p><p><supplementary-material id="fig1s1sdata1"><label>Figure 1—figure supplement 1—source data 1.</label><caption><title>Raw data used for panel C.</title></caption><media mime-subtype="xlsx" mimetype="application" xlink:href="elife-66406-fig1-figsupp1-data1-v3.xlsx"/></supplementary-material></p></caption><graphic mime-subtype="tiff" mimetype="image" xlink:href="elife-66406-fig1-figsupp1-v3.tif"/></fig></fig-group><p>A gRNA consists of a repeat region, which is often identical for all gRNAs in the array, and a spacer (here used synonymously with ‘guide region’), which serves to guide the Cas12a protein to complementary double-stranded DNA (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1B</xref>). In their natural bacterial setting, the full-length repeat sequence includes a short (~16–18 nt) fragment that gets excised and discarded during gRNA processing and maturation, leaving the final, processed gRNA to consist of a post-processing repeat and a spacer (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1B</xref>). The excised repeat fragment, which we here denote a <italic>CRISPR separator</italic>, undergoes cleavage at its 3’ end by Cas12a itself, and at its 5’ end by an unknown bacterial enzyme (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Swarts, 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1B</xref>). The separator is not strictly needed for array function and has no known role, as far as we are aware. Cas12a cannot excise the separator on its own, which means that it remains attached to the 3’ end of the upstream spacer in mammalian cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">Zetsche et al., 2017</xref>). For this reason, and because the separator has been seen as dispensable, the separator has been omitted when Cas12a arrays have been experimentally expressed in eukaryotic cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1C</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Campa et al., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Kleinstiver et al., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Tak et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">Zetsche et al., 2017</xref>). Yet, despite being under intense evolutionary pressure, the fact that Cas12a arrays from all known bacterial species retain the CRISPR separator suggests that it might have a biological function.</p><p>Here, we hypothesized that the separator plays a role in facilitating CRISPR array processing and that array performance is impaired in its absence. We find that gRNAs lacking the separator are highly sensitive to the content of guanine and cytosine (GC) nucleotides in the upstream spacer. Specifically, the higher the GC content of a spacer, the worse the downstream gRNA performs. We notice that the natural separator sequence is rich in adenine and thymine/uracil (AT/U) nucleotides, and we therefore surmised that the separator insulates neighboring gRNAs from one another. We design and insert a synthetic separator (<italic>synSeparator</italic>) consisting of four A/T nucleotides between each gRNA in a Cas12a CRISPR array; this allows more effective CRISPR activation of multiple endogenous genes in human cells. Based on these results, we conclude that the CRISPR separator found in natural Cas12a arrays acts as an insulator that reduces interference between adjacent gRNAs. These results show how natural systems can guide optimization of CRISPR-mediated synthetic multi-gene regulation.</p></sec><sec id="s2" sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><sec id="s2-1"><title>gRNA performance is affected by the GC content of the upstream spacer</title><p>In bacteria-harboring CRISPR-Cas systems, new spacers are acquired from viral genomes and integrated into the CRISPR array. It is possible that some spacer sequences form RNA secondary structures that interfere with Cas12a processing of the array. RNA secondary structure is in fact known to impede Cas protein binding and processing in similar contexts. For example, Cas12a function is sensitive to hairpin formation downstream of the CRISPR array (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Liao et al., 2019a</xref>), and gRNA processing is impaired by base-pairing of the repeat with regions outside the gRNA (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Creutzburg et al., 2020</xref>). Global RNA structure of the CRISPR array may negatively affect both gRNA processing and performance (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Liao et al., 2019b</xref>). Similarly, the RNA-guided, RNA-cleaving protein Cas13 can also be negatively affected by gRNA secondary structure (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Abudayyeh et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Yan et al., 2018</xref>). It is therefore theoretically plausible that local secondary structure within the transcribed CRISPR array could interfere with array processing (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1C</xref>). One feature that promotes RNA secondary structure formation is high GC content (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Chan et al., 2009</xref>) because G-C base pairs contain three hydrogen bonds, compared to A-U’s two hydrogen bonds. We first tested whether the GC content of a spacer could affect performance of a downstream gRNA.</p><p>To do this, we first developed a method for assembling CRISPR arrays using oligonucleotide hybridization and ligation, with which we could assemble CRISPR arrays containing up to 30 gRNAs (Materials and methods). We used this method to assemble a simple Cas12a array consisting of two consecutive gRNAs whose repeat regions did not contain the separator sequence (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1D</xref>). In this array, the second gRNA’s spacer was complementary to the promoter of GFP, which had been genomically integrated into HEK293T cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1E</xref>). The first gRNA’s spacer instead consisted of a non-targeting sequence, which we could alter to study its effect on GFP activation. We refer to this sequence as a dummy spacer.</p><p>To study the consequences of varying the dummy spacer, we transfected the HEK293T cells with constructs encoding the CRISPR array and nuclease-deactivated Cas12a (from <italic>Lachnospiraceae bacterium</italic>) fused to the miniaturized VP64-p65-Rta (mini-VPR) tripartite activator and mCherry (subsequently denoted dCas12a-miniVPR) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Vora et al., 2018</xref>). If the dummy spacer did not influence the performance of the downstream gRNA, we should see equal GFP activation in all experiments. If, on the other hand, the dummy spacer affected the performance of the downstream spacer, we would measure differences in GFP fluorescence. Surprisingly, we found that the CRISPR array sometimes displayed hypersensitivity to the composition of the dummy spacer: In extreme cases, a single nucleotide change from T to G led to almost complete abrogation of GFP activation in transfected cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1F</xref>, Materials and methods).</p><p>We asked how such hypersensitivity could come about. We generated a library of 51 CRISPR arrays containing one dummy spacer with varying GC content (10–90%), and one GFP-targeting spacer that was identical in all arrays. Forty-eight hours after transfection, we analyzed cells by flow cytometry and quantified GFP fluorescence as a measure of array performance. Intriguingly, we observed a strong negative correlation between the GC content of the dummy spacer and GFP activation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1G</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1A</xref>; the percentage of GFP<sup>+</sup> cells was a more sensitive measure of array performance than median GFP fluorescence, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1B</xref>). This indicated that spacers can exert a strong influence on the performance of the downstream gRNA.</p><p>Since these dummy spacers were random sequences, we asked whether the distribution of GC content within these spacers mattered for their effect on the downstream gRNA. We first divided all the dummy spacers into three groups based on whether they enabled high, medium, or low GFP activation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1G</xref>). For each dummy spacer, we calculated the GC content of a sliding 5-nt window (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1H</xref>; Materials and methods). Interestingly, this analysis showed that ‘permissive’ dummy spacers had relatively low GC content at the 3’ end, close to the Cas12a cleavage site. In contrast, non-permissive dummy spacers had slightly higher GC content at the 3’ end. Dummy spacers that enabled medium-level GFP activation had quite high overall GC content but lower GC content close to the 3’ end. This suggested that the GC content of the spacer’s last few bases, close to the Cas12a cleavage site, might be a more important determinant than the overall GC content of a spacer.</p><p>Surprisingly, dummy spacers in the 50–90% GC range exhibited a wide range of GFP activation, some enabling unexpectedly high GFP activation and others unexpectedly low (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1G</xref>). We analyzed the sliding GC content specifically of these spacers and found that unexpectedly permissive dummy spacers showed an even stronger trend toward low GC content at the 3’ end (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1I</xref>). In contrast, unexpectedly non-permissive dummy spacers had high GC content at the 3’ end (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1J</xref>). Thus, even if a dummy spacer had high GC content, it could still allow efficient performance of the GFP-targeting gRNA if GC content in the last 3–5 bases was low, and vice versa.</p><p>GC content of the entire dummy spacer was moderately predictive of GFP activation (R<sup>2</sup> = 0.45; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1K</xref>; Materials and methods). However, we found that simply knowing the average GC content of the last three nucleotides in the dummy spacer allowed slightly better predictive power than knowing the GC content of the whole dummy spacer (R<sup>2</sup> = 0.52; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1K</xref>). The GC content of these last three bases was more predictive of array performance than that of any other three bases in the dummy spacer (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1K</xref>). These results indicated that high GC content at the 3’ end of a spacer impairs performance of the subsequent gRNA.</p><p>GC content is a determinant of secondary structure formation. Such secondary structures might interfere with proper folding of the GFP-targeting gRNA. We used the online tool RNAfold (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Lorenz et al., 2011</xref>) to calculate secondary structure formation for the library of 51 dummy spacers with the GFP-targeting gRNA. To quantify the propensity to form secondary structures, we used the calculated free energy of the thermodynamic ensemble, a measure of the stability of the set of structures adopted by an RNA molecule. We indeed found a strong positive correlation between GC content and predicted secondary structure formation (R<sup>2</sup> = 0.66; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1L</xref>). Accordingly, there was a corresponding anticorrelation between predicted RNA structure and array performance. This anticorrelation was strongest when both the dummy spacer and the subsequent GFP-targeting gRNA were used as input to RNAfold (R<sup>2</sup> = 0.57; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1M</xref>) rather than only the dummy spacer (R<sup>2</sup> = 0.27; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1C</xref>). This suggested that high-GC spacers may form secondary structures that are particularly disruptive if they directly involve the downstream gRNA. Taken together, these results suggest that high GC content in spacers can lead to secondary structure formation, which may interfere with proper folding and processing of the CRISPR array transcript.</p></sec><sec id="s2-2"><title>Natural CRISPR arrays contain separator sequences with low GC content</title><p>We next asked whether bacteria have evolved mechanisms to preferentially incorporate low-GC spacers into their CRISPR arrays to overcome the hypersensitivity to spacer GC content. After all, it could be detrimental to a bacterium if it accidentally incorporated a high-GC spacer that lowered the performance of a pre-existing gRNA. To address this question, we analyzed 727 naturally occurring Cas12a spacer sequences from 30 bacterial species containing the Type V-A CRISPR (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="supp2">Supplementary file 2</xref>; Materials and methods). However, we did not find any conspicuous absence of GC-rich spacers: Spacer GC content was distributed around an average of 39%, with a range of 10–70% (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2A</xref>), though spacer GC content did vary between species and was weakly correlated with the overall genomic GC content (R<sup>2</sup> = 0.16; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s1">Figure 2—figure supplement 1A</xref>).

However, we did detect a strong bias for low GC content in the 79 separator sequences (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2B–C</xref>).

Interestingly, addition of the AT-rich natural separator, or the synSeparator, appeared to loosen up these structures or create an accessible bulge at the Cas12a cleavage site (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3H</xref>). This suggested that, for spacers prone to forming obstructive secondary structures, AT-rich separators give Cas12a improved access to its cleavage site.</p><p>We asked whether the GFP-targeting gRNA would be most sensitive to secondary structures that form exclusively within the dummy spacer or to structures that also involve the repeat region of the GFP-targeting gRNA. To address this question, we generated several variants of a short CRISPR array guided by RNAfold secondary structure prediction, where we gradually mutated the dummy spacer to form secondary structures that were either limited to the dummy spacer or that competed with the natural pseudoknot structure in the GFP-gRNA’s repeat region (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s1">Figure 3—figure supplement 1A</xref>, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="supp1">Supplementary file 1</xref>).

Indeed, such a positional effect has been observed in <italic>E. coli</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Liao et al., 2019b</xref>). To test whether we would observe such a positional effect, we designed four CRISPR arrays consisting of one GFP-targeting spacer and three dummy spacers (30–33% GC; <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="supp4">Supplementary file 4</xref>), where the GFP-targeting spacer was in a different position in each array (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s1">Figure 3—figure supplement 1C</xref>).

The synSeparator was not included for this experiment. We observed no difference in GFP activation between any of the four arrays (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s1">Figure 3—figure supplement 1D</xref>).

Specifically, high GC content at the 3’ end of a spacer leads to poor performance of the downstream gRNA (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1H–K</xref>). This is likely caused by secondary structures (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1M</xref>) that are either restricted to a single gRNA or involve two consecutive gRNAs (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s1">Figure 3—figure supplement 1A,B</xref>). CRISPR arrays containing such disruptive gRNAs are processed inefficiently by Cas12a (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4B–E</xref>), which likely explains their poor performance. However, AT-rich separator sequences, even short, 4-nt sequences, can break up such secondary structures and give Cas12a access to its cleavage site (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3H</xref>), improving CRISPR array performance (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3D–J</xref>). Consequently, including short synSeparators between the gRNAs in a Cas12a array is a simple way to improve CRISPRa performance in human cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5</xref>).</p><sec id="s3-1"><title>Considerations for activation of endogenous genes</title><p>We note that the improvement afforded by the synSeparator was not as large for the endogenous genes as for our experimental system with the worst-performing dummy spacers. We speculate that this may be for either of two reasons. First, for the CRISPR arrays in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5</xref>, we used spacers that were either derived from previously published studies or had been pre-tested in our lab. All these spacers likely represent the best of several tested spacers and had thus already been shown to work even in the absence of a synSeparator. We did not necessarily select them for being GC-rich or prone to secondary structure formation. Therefore, researchers may experience the greatest benefit from the synSeparator with spacers that have not already proved functional without the synSeparator. Second, our clonal HEK293T cell line likely carries several copies of the GFP gene in its genome, each of which has seven protospacers in its TRE3G promoter. This multitude of Cas12a binding sites may serve to amplify the CRISPRa effect compared to endogenous genes, which only have two Cas12a binding sites, one in each copy of the gene (though the aneuploid HEK293T cells may have more).</p><p>One limitation of our study was that we only investigated the performance of the synSeparator in HEK293T cells and not other cell types. HEK293T cells are easy to transfect and readily express a large protein like dCas12a-VPR-mCherry (&gt;6 kb). We nevertheless hypothesize that the negative influence of high-GC spacers and the insulating effect of synSeparators are generalizable across cell types. That is because we could observe these effects even in the cell-free context of an in vitro expression system (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4</xref>). This suggests that the sensitivity to spacer GC content is determined only by the interaction between Cas12a and the array, rather than being dependent on a particular cellular context. We surmise that the synSeparator will be most beneficial in cells that can readily express a dCas12a activator and preferentially for high-GC spacers that have not already been shown to work even without a synSeparator.</p></sec><sec id="s3-2"><title>GFP as readout of CRISPR array performance</title><p>We used an experimental system where GFP fluorescence served as a readout of CRISPR array performance. In this system, the <italic>percentage of GFP<sup>+</sup> cells</italic> was a more sensitive measure of array performance than <italic>median GFP fluorescence</italic> (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1G</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1</xref>). Even low levels of <italic>GFP</italic> transcription leads to bright GFP fluorescence. We used a relatively weak Cas12a activator (Lb-dCas12a driven by the PGK promoter, with mini-VPR rather than full-length VPR), where the percentage of GFP<sup>+</sup> cells rarely exceeded 20. This was deliberate; the combination of a weak Cas activator and a GFP-percentage readout was ideal for measuring small differences in CRISPR array performance. We speculate that in cases where a very strong Cas activator is used (where most cells activate GFP), median GFP fluorescence may be a better measure.</p></sec><sec id="s3-3"><title>Suggested mechanism of action for the synSeparator</title><p>In our experiments, including the full 16-nt separator from <italic>L. bacterium</italic> in a CRISPR array led to an almost complete failure to activate the target gene (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3B</xref>). At face value, this would seem to contrast with previous studies that reported efficacious CRISPR editing even when including the separator (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Liu et al., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">Zetsche et al., 2017</xref>). But we think these data actually support our findings. First, in Liu et al., the pre-processed repeat (including the separator) shows improved performance if it is positioned upstream of the gRNA. If one such repeat was additionally placed downstream of the gRNA, this construct performed the worst of all tested constructs. This is consistent with our conclusion that the full-length separator reduces performance of gRNAs when present in CRISPR arrays in mammalian cells. Second, our array in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3B</xref> is not entirely non-functional. Re-running the same experiment with a stronger Cas12a-activator (Cas12a-VPR; also used in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5</xref>) shows some GFP activation even with the full separator (1.4% vs 20.8% GFP<sup>+</sup> cells). But for consistency, we have used the same, slightly less effective, Cas12a activator (dCas12a-miniVPR) for all GFP-targeting experiments. Third, both the Liu et al. and Zetsche et al. studies used CRISPR editing rather than CRISPRa. We speculate that this might explain the relatively high indel frequency: Only a single cleavage event needs to take place for an indel to occur, whereas gene activation presumably requires the Cas12a activator to be present on the promoter for extended periods of time.</p><p>We found that the AAAT synSeparator improves the ability of Cas12a to process a poor-performing CRISPR array containing a 70%-GC dummy spacer (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4</xref>). This result supports our observations that spacer GC content is correlated with predicted secondary structure formation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1L</xref>) and that GC content close to the Cas12a cleavage site is particularly predictive of the performance of the downstream gRNA (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1K</xref>). Furthermore, previous data show that Cas12a processing is sensitive to RNA secondary structure (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Creutzburg et al., 2020</xref>). Thus, it is likely that the synSeparator improves performance of CRISPR arrays in vivo by increasing Cas12a processing efficiency. In our Cas12a cleavage assay, we observed that array processing still occurred even without the synSeparator, though it was less efficient than with the synSeparator. These experimental conditions do not necessarily reflect the situation inside living cells. For example, we used an excess of Cas12a protein (16:1 Cas12a:array ratio), which may not be the case inside cells. Furthermore, our in vitro conditions in principle allow the reaction to proceed to completion (even though the reaction appears to slow down after 30 min, possibly due to the lower concentration of available Cas12a molecules as more and more Cas12a molecules become sequestered by their RNA cleavage products and unavailable to participate in further processing events). This may not be true in a living eukaryotic cell, where RNA turnover may constantly remove partially processed CRISPR arrays. Under these conditions, slow processing kinetics may serve to prevent the complete processing of gRNAs.</p><p>One additional possible mechanism for how the synSeparator improves CRISPR array performance could be that the synSeparator improves the GFP-targeting spacer itself rather than facilitating gRNA processing. In other words, that it is the synSeparator downstream of the GFP-targeting spacer, rather than the one upstream, that improves performance by remaining attached to the post-processed GFP-targeting spacer. This would be in line with studies showing that gRNA performance can be improved by RNA 3’ spacer extensions (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Creutzburg et al., 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Kocak et al., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Nguyen et al., 2020</xref>). However, our results demonstrate that the synSeparator exerts its beneficial effect before or during gRNA processing, rather than by modifying the 3’ end of the post-processed GFP-targeting spacer itself (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3F</xref>; <italic>version</italic> 2 vs. <italic>version 3</italic>; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4</xref>). In addition, RNA secondary structure prediction (RNAfold) did not indicate that the GFP-targeting spacer would fold back on itself when an AAAT extension is added to the 3’ end, which would have been the case for the mechanism demonstrated by Creutzburg et al. (data not shown). Although we cannot exclude that a 3’ extension to the GFP-targeting gRNA itself contributes to gRNA efficacy (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3F</xref>, <italic>version</italic> 3 vs. <italic>version 4</italic>), such an effect would be marginal.</p><p>A competing explanation for the synSeparator’s function could be that the natural and synthetic separators provide a specific sequence motif that aids Cas12a binding and/or processing rather than counteracting secondary structure formation. However, natural separators contain no conserved sequence close to Cas12a’s binding site that could act as such a binding motif (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2C</xref>). And we found that different synSeparators can rescue poor array performance (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3I</xref>). Thus, this possibility is unlikely.</p><p>It is conceivable that our introduction of AAAT synSeparators could introduce polyadenylation sites (e.g., AATAAA, ATTAAA, AGTAAA, etc.) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Beaudoing et al., 2000</xref>), which could prematurely terminate the transcript and reduce CRISPRa activity. However, we analyzed all sequences and found that this was not the case. In any case, polyadenylation sites are AT-rich, so if this was an issue, AT-rich dummy spacers would be expected to perform worse than GC-rich ones, which is the opposite of what was observed (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1G</xref>).</p></sec><sec id="s3-4"><title>Generalizability and outlook</title><p>We found that the beneficial effect of adding an AT-rich synSeparator was not limited to the AAAT sequence derived from the natural separator of <italic>L. bacterium</italic>; three other AT-rich synSeparators also rescued the detrimental effects of a high-GC upstream spacer, though with various efficacy (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3I</xref>). We speculate that the quantitative difference between the synSeparators could either be due to intrinsic insulation capacity of these sequences or the way they interact with Lb-Cas12a, or sequence-specific interactions with this particular CRISPR array.</p><p>It is informative to compare the separator of Cas12a with that of Cas13d. Cas13d’s pre-processed repeat also contains an AT-rich separator sequence. Like Cas12a, Cas13d itself can only cleave the 3’ end of its separator (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Yan et al., 2018</xref>). But Cas13d gRNAs nonetheless perform well in mammalian cells despite the separator remaining attached to the spacer. Perhaps this is because the Cas13d separator is only six nt long, in contrast to Cas12a’s 16–18 nt. A recent study found that the performance of Cas12a gRNAs starts to drop if RNA sequences &gt; 13 nt long are attached to the 3’ end of the spacer (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Nguyen et al., 2020</xref>), consistent with this hypothesis.</p><p>As a biotechnology, improvement of simultaneous gene targeting is beneficial to several applications. In this work, we demonstrated improvement of endogenous gene activation using the redesigned CRISPR array containing the synthetic separator, but it is possible that the same design can be used for multiplexed gene editing and base editing using the Cas12a system. Furthermore, because CRISPR-mediated multi-gene activation has been increasingly used for stem cell reprogramming and large-scale genetic screening (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Replogle et al., 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Weltner et al., 2018</xref>), our method will further enhance these emerging applications. Taken together, the results from our study suggest that the CRISPR separator has evolved as an integral part of the repeat region and that one of its functions is to insulate gRNAs from the disrupting effects of varying GC content in upstream spacers. This insulating effect of AT-rich CRISPR separators may be important enough to have helped shape the evolution of Cas12a CRISPR arrays. Furthermore, our study demonstrates how design inspired by the natural CRISPR system can improve the efficacy of tools for CRISPR gene editing and regulation.</p></sec></sec><sec id="s4" sec-type="materials|methods"><title>Materials and methods</title><table-wrap id="keyresource" position="anchor"><label>Key resources table</label><table frame="hsides" rules="groups"><thead><tr><th align="left" valign="bottom">Reagent type (species) or resource</th><th align="left" valign="bottom">Designation</th><th align="left" valign="bottom">Source or reference</th><th align="left" valign="bottom">Identifiers</th><th align="left" valign="bottom">Additional information</th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td align="left" valign="bottom">Cell line (<italic>Homo sapiens</italic>)</td><td align="left" valign="bottom">HEK Lenti-X 293T (modified)</td><td align="left" valign="bottom">Takara Bio</td><td align="left" valign="bottom">632,180</td><td align="left" valign="bottom">Genomically integrated TRE3G-GFP</td></tr><tr><td align="left" valign="bottom">Commercial assay or kit</td><td align="left" valign="bottom">iScript cDNA Synthesis Kit</td><td align="left" valign="bottom">Bio-Rad</td><td align="left" valign="bottom">1708890</td><td align="left" valign="bottom"/></tr><tr><td align="left" valign="bottom">Commercial assay or kit</td><td align="left" valign="bottom">RNeasey Plus Mini Kit</td><td align="left" valign="bottom">Qiagen</td><td align="left" valign="bottom">74,134</td><td align="left" valign="bottom"/></tr><tr><td align="left" valign="bottom">Commercial assay or kit</td><td align="left" valign="bottom">iTaq Universal SYBR Green Supermix</td><td align="left" valign="bottom">Bio-Rad</td><td align="left" valign="bottom">1725120</td><td align="left" valign="bottom"/></tr><tr><td align="left" valign="bottom">Peptide, recombinant protein</td><td align="left" valign="bottom">T7 DNA Ligase</td><td align="left" valign="bottom">NEB</td><td align="left" valign="bottom">M0318S</td><td align="left" valign="bottom"/></tr><tr><td align="left" valign="bottom">Peptide, recombinant protein</td><td align="left" valign="bottom">T4 Polynucleotide Kinase</td><td align="left" valign="bottom">NEB</td><td align="left" valign="bottom">M0201L</td><td align="left" valign="bottom"/></tr><tr><td align="left" valign="bottom">Commercial assay or kit</td><td align="left" valign="bottom">NucleoSpin Gel and PCR Clean-up</td><td align="left" valign="bottom">Takara</td><td align="left" valign="bottom">32–740609.50</td><td align="left" valign="bottom"/></tr><tr><td align="left" valign="bottom">Commercial assay or kit</td><td align="left" valign="bottom">In-Fusion HD Cloning Plus</td><td align="left" valign="bottom">Takara</td><td align="left" valign="bottom">638,920</td><td align="left" valign="bottom"/></tr><tr><td align="left" valign="bottom">Commercial assay or kit</td><td align="left" valign="bottom">KAPA HiFi Hot-start PCR kit</td><td align="left" valign="bottom">Roche</td><td align="left" valign="bottom">07958897001</td><td align="left" valign="bottom"/></tr><tr><td align="left" valign="bottom">Commercial assay or kit</td><td align="left" valign="bottom">HiScribe T7 Quick High Yield RNA Synthesis Kit</td><td align="left" valign="bottom">NEB</td><td align="left" valign="bottom">E2040S</td><td align="left" valign="bottom"/></tr><tr><td align="left" valign="bottom">Commercial assay or kit</td><td align="left" valign="bottom">MEGAclear Transcription Clean-Up Kit</td><td align="left" valign="bottom">Thermo Fisher</td><td align="left" valign="bottom">AM1908</td><td align="left" valign="bottom"/></tr><tr><td align="left" valign="bottom">Peptide, recombinant protein</td><td align="left" valign="bottom">EnGen Lba Cas12a (Cpf1) -

Mg<sup>2+</sup> is important for the proper folding of the gRNA pseudoknot (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Dong et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Fonfara et al., 2016</xref>). The concentration of free Mg<sup>2+</sup> inside living cells is on the order of 1 mM (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Maeshima et al., 2018</xref>). We found that a MgCl<sub>2</sub> concentration of 2 mM gave slightly crisper cleavage products than 1, 5, or 10 mM, and we used 2 mM for all experiments.</p><table-wrap id="inlinetable3" position="anchor"><table frame="hsides" rules="groups"><thead><tr><th align="left" valign="bottom">Component</th><th align="left" valign="bottom">Volume</th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td align="left" valign="bottom">Cleavage buffer</td><td align="left" valign="bottom">4.3 µl</td></tr><tr><td align="left" valign="bottom">RNA (1 µg/µl)</td><td align="left" valign="bottom">0.25 µl</td></tr><tr><td align="left" valign="bottom">Cas12a (100 µM)</td><td align="left" valign="bottom">0.45 µl</td></tr><tr><td align="left" valign="bottom">Total</td><td align="left" valign="bottom">5 µl</td></tr></tbody></table></table-wrap><p>First, we added 0.25 µl RNA (1 µg/µl stock) to 4.3 µl cleavage buffer, heat-denatured this solution at 70°C for 2 min and transferred the vials to room temperature. Then we added 0.45 µl Cas12a (100 µM stock solution) and immediately transferred the tubes to a pre-heated thermocycler set at 37°C. Because each CRISPR array contains three cleavage sites and Cas12a remains bound to its gRNA after processing, we used an excess of Cas12a protein (16:1 Cas12a:array). To stop the reaction, we added 0.3 µl proteinase K (New England Biolabs, 800 U/ml stock solution, which had been pre-diluted 1:1 in cleavage buffer) and transferred vials to a thermocycler pre-set to 50°C, where they were incubated for 1 hr and then transferred to ice. Samples were analyzed on a 2,100 Bionalyzer (Agilent, CA) using RNA Nano 6000 chips. Samples and Low Range ssRNA Ladder (New England Biolabs) were heat-denatured at 70°C for 2 min and transferred to ice immediately before loading on the chip in order to minimize secondary structure formation. Bioanalyzer results were normalized based on the sample with the lowest RNA concentration to enable quantitative comparisons between replicates. To calculate how many percent of gRNAs had been fully processed (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4E</xref>), we used the Bioanalyzer’s output of the area of the RNA peak corresponding to fully processed, single gRNA and divided this by the total area of all peaks to estimate the fraction of the total RNA that was contained in the peak corresponding to fully excised, single gRNAs. If processing of these CRISPR arrays proceeds to completion, 28% and 29% of the total RNA mass should be composed of single gRNAs for the two arrays, respectively (e.g., (41 + 42)/(57 + 41 + 42 + 158) = 0.28 for the array without the synSeparator; see <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4A</xref>), whereas the remaining RNA mass should consist of the upstream and downstream sequences. We divided the observed fraction of single gRNAs with 0.28 and 0.29, respectively, to find the percentage of maximum processing that had occurred.</p></sec></sec></body><back><sec id="s5" sec-type="additional-information"><title>Additional information</title><fn-group content-type="competing-interest"><title>Competing interests</title><fn fn-type="COI-statement" id="conf1"><p>The authors have filed a US provisional patent application related to this work (application no. 63/139,095).</p></fn></fn-group><fn-group content-type="author-contribution"><title>Author contributions</title><fn fn-type="con" id="con1"><p>Conceptualization, Formal analysis, Investigation, Methodology, Project administration, Software, Supervision, Visualization, Writing – original draft, Writing – review and editing</p></fn><fn fn-type="con" id="con2"><p>Investigation, Writing – review and editing</p></fn><fn fn-type="con" id="con3"><p>Investigation</p></fn><fn fn-type="con" id="con4"><p>Conceptualization, Funding acquisition, Project administration, Resources, Supervision, Writing – review and editing</p></fn></fn-group></sec><sec id="s6" sec-type="supplementary-material"><title>Additional files</title><supplementary-material id="supp1"><label>Supplementary file 1.</label><caption><title>Spacer, repeat and separator sequences used and analyzed in this study.</title></caption><media mime-subtype="xlsx" mimetype="application" xlink:href="elife-66406-supp1-v3.xlsx"/></supplementary-material><supplementary-material id="supp2"><label>Supplementary file 2.</label><caption><title>Naturally occurring CRISPR-Cas sequences analyzed in this study.</title></caption><media mime-subtype="xlsx" mimetype="application" xlink:href="elife-66406-supp2-v3.xlsx"/></supplementary-material><supplementary-material id="supp3"><label>Supplementary file 3.</label><caption><title>Spacers and qPCR primers used for endogenous gene activation (related to <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5</xref>).</title></caption><media mime-subtype="xlsx" mimetype="application" xlink:href="elife-66406-supp3-v3.xlsx"/></supplementary-material><supplementary-material id="supp4"><label>Supplementary file 4.</label><caption><title>CAGp-FireflyLuciferase-Array-Terminator (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3C</xref>).</title></caption><media mime-subtype="docx" mimetype="application" xlink:href="elife-66406-supp4-v3.docx"/></supplementary-material><supplementary-material id="transrepform"><label>Transparent reporting form</label><media mime-subtype="docx" mimetype="application" xlink:href="elife-66406-transrepform1-v3.docx"/></supplementary-material></sec><sec id="s7" sec-type="data-availability"><title>Data availability</title><p>All data generated or analyzed during this study are included in the manuscript and supporting files.

revisions, shown below. We also include an acceptance summary that explains what the editors found interesting or important about the work.</p></boxed-text><p><bold>Acceptance summary:</bold></p><p>The Cas12a protein from type V CRISPR-Cas systems can be used for genome editing or modulating gene expression in mammalian cells. One of the advantages of Cas12a over other CRISPR-based systems is the ability to multiplex guide RNAs in a single array. Here, the authors show that processing of RNAs from these arrays can be inhibited by RNA secondary structure, which can be reversed by introducing an artificial sequence, coined the &quot;synSeparator&quot;, between guide RNAs. The use of synSeparators increases the activity of Cas12a in mammalian cells, and thus represents an important advance in the development of Cas12a for biotechnology applications.</p><p><bold>Decision letter after peer review:</bold></p><p>Thank you for submitting your article &quot;Enhanced Cas12a multi-gene regulation using a CRISPR array separator&quot; for consideration by <italic>eLife</italic>. Your article has been reviewed by 3 peer reviewers, including Joseph T Wade as the Reviewing Editor and Reviewer #2, and the evaluation has been overseen by Detlef Weigel as the Senior Editor. The following individual involved in review of your submission has agreed to reveal their identity: Chase Beisel (Reviewer #1).</p><p>The reviewers have discussed their reviews with one another, and the Reviewing Editor has drafted this to help you prepare a revised submission.</p><p>Essential revisions:</p><p>1. The authors should test more specific models for how the A/T-rich synSeparators promote crRNA activity, either by analyzing existing data with different separator variants, or experimentally testing more separator/spacer combinations to address specific models. The reviewers recommend focusing on secondary structure in the repeat sequences as a likely source of synSeparator activity.</p><p>2. To show that synSeparators are broadly useful for multiplexed Cas12a applications, the authors should test additional targeting crRNA guides, ideally with the design informed by mechanistic insight from Essential Revision #1. The authors should also test crRNAs with synSeparators in another cell line and/or with a different Cas12a protein to further show generalizability.</p><p><italic>Reviewer #1 (Recommendations for the authors):</italic></p><p>Some additional literature should be integrated into manuscript. Fonfara Nature 2016 showed that Cpf1 encodes a distinct domain responsible for processing the transcribed CRISPR array into individual crRNAs. Liao Nat Commun 2019 showed that the order of the spacer in a CRISPR-Cas12a array can immensely impact multiplexed targeting, where targeting by one crRNA was strongly inhibited due to its repeat pairing with the upstream spacer. McCarty Nat Commun 2020 provided a comprehensive review of multiplexing approaches with CRISPR, including the use of CRISPR arrays.</p><p>To support general claims, the authors would need to show that the same trends persist when testing different guide sequences. This would include the selected synthetic separators as well as the natural separator.</p><p>The authors also need to integrate the folding of the repeat hairpin, as improper folding likely explains the authors' results more-so than general folding of the upstream guide sequence.</p><p>References on line 40 should be replaced with the original demonstration of crRNA processing (Brouns Science 2008) and possibly include the original paper characterizing Cas12a (Zetsche Cell 2015).</p><p>Descriptions around processing should consider the fact that the spacer is also trimmed to the 20 – 24 nt guide naturally observed with Cas12a crRNAs (Zetsche Cell 2015).</p><p>L. 63 – 64: A more reasonable reason for removal of the separator in the original work was that it was seen as dispensable rather than interfering with targeting activity.</p><p>Specify somewhere early in the Results which Cas12a was used (e.g. As, Lb, Fn).</p><p>L. 301: The claim of a significant increase needs to be supported statistically. Given the smaller fold-changes and the duplicate measurements, many of these increases may not be statistically significant.</p><p><italic>Reviewer #2 (Recommendations for the authors):</italic></p><p>1. The data in Figure 1 correlate predicted secondary structure with crRNA activity. However, this relationship can be tested more directly. I would like to see targeted substitutions in the separator that are predicted to lead to specific changes in secondary structure at key positions around the Cas12a cleavage site.</p><p>2. The authors speculate that the separator sequences affect Cas12a processing of the crRNAs, but they rely on indirect readouts of crRNA processing. It would be informative to measure processed crRNA levels directly, especially for the experiment shown in Figure 4. crRNA processing could also be assayed in vitro using purified Cas12a.</p><p>3. The data in Figure 4 show a modest effect of introducing a short, A/T-rich separator in the CRISPR array. I think even a small improvement in crRNA activity would be an important advance, so the magnitude of the effect is not a concern. However, I would like to see more than one CRISPR array tested, and it would be informative to individually replace A/T-rich separators with G/C-rich separators. Also, does the spacer order matter? Spacer order could also affect RNA secondary structure.</p><p><italic>Reviewer #3 (Recommendations for the authors):</italic></p><p>1.

The most important issue relates to Figure 4. The new in vitro assay is a nice addition since it suggests the effects of RNA secondary structure are directly on Cas12a. However, I am a little confused by the data presentation in Figure 4, and I think you may be overstating the magnitude of the difference in cleavage between RNAs with/without a SynSeparator. There is clearly an improvement from adding the SynSeparator, which alone is sufficient reason to include these new data. However, you should either more clearly explain/present the data, or soften your conclusions. See comment #3 below for more details.</p><p>Specific comments:</p><p>1. Lines 578-585 (Discussion).

However, in panel B, there is almost no difference in the abundance of the 41/42 nt products between 30 and 60 minutes. Moreover, the kinetics of cleavage for the RNA without a SynSeparator are clearly delayed relative to the RNA with a SynSeparator, but cleavage appears to saturate after ~30 minutes (see also panels E and F of the supplementary figure, which to my eye are almost identical). Figure 4E suggests that only 20% of possible cleavage has occurred after 60 minutes for the RNA without a SynSeparator. If that is the case, why is it that cleavage appears to have saturated after 30 minutes? The authors need to present and describe these data more clearly, and potentially soften their conclusions.</p><p>4.

The authors should test more specific models for how the A/T-rich synSeparators promote crRNA activity, either by analyzing existing data with different separator variants, or experimentally testing more separator/spacer combinations to address specific models. The reviewers recommend focusing on secondary structure in the repeat sequences as a likely source of synSeparator activity.</p></disp-quote><p>We have now performed several new experiments and computational analyses to explore the mechanism by which synSeparators enhance CRISPR array performance (These experiments are also described in response to specific reviewers’ comments). After performing these experiments, we are confident that appending A/T-rich synSeparators does enhance the efficiency of crRNA array cleavage, which explains the better multiple gene activation we observed in cells. These efforts include:</p><p>First, we performed an in vitro Cas12a cleavage assay where we investigated Cas12a’s ability to process CRISPR arrays containing spacers with high or low GC content, and with or without the synSeparator. We now present these data in a new main figure (Figure 4) and an associated supplemental figure (Figure S4). We found that array processing is less efficient when the upstream dummy spacer has high GC content (70%) than when it has low GC content (30%) (Figure 4E). Inserting an AT-rich 4-nt synSeparator between each gRNA rescues this processing defect and makes processing of the array with the 70%-GC spacer nearly as efficient as that with the 30%-GC spacer</p><p>(Figure 4E). We present a time-course measurement of cleavage where we subjected CRISPR arrays to Cas12a processing for different amounts of time. Under these experimental conditions, fully processed, single gRNAs are detectable after 10 minutes, at which time the synSeparator-containing array already shows increased processing efficiency compared to the array without the synSeparator (Figure 4B-E). These results are consistent with the functional performance of these very same arrays in cells (Figure 3D). The results demonstrate that high-GC spacers can impair array processing and that an AT-rich synSeparator can rescue poor processing of these arrays. Perhaps surprising is the observation that some processing did occur of the array with the 70%-GC dummy spacer, even without the synSeparator. This is surprising because this same array allowed virtually no GFP activation in cells (Figure 3D). We have added a paragraph in the Discussion where we speculate that the experimental conditions in the cleavage assay may not perfectly mimic those in a living cell. For example, the cleavage assay is in principle allowed to proceed to completion, whereas RNA degradation in a cell might render CRISPR arrays non-functional if they are not processed fast enough.</p><p>Second, we have performed a new experiment where we introduced a series of targeted point mutations in the dummy gRNA that were designed to provoke secondary structure formation. The purpose of this experiment was to gain a better mechanistic understanding of where the most disruptive secondary structures are located. Specifically, we asked whether a GFP-targeting gRNA would be most sensitive to secondary structures that form exclusively within the upstream (dummy) spacer, or to structures that also involve the repeat region of the GFP-targeting gRNA itself. We present these results in a new supplemental figure (Figure S3) and an accompanying paragraph in the main text. To address this question, we generated several variants of a short CRISPR array where we gradually mutated the dummy spacer to form secondary structures that were either localized to the dummy spacer or that competed with the natural pseudoknot structure in the GFP-gRNA’s repeat region (Figure S3A, Table S1). These designs were guided by a secondary structure prediction tool, RNAfold. Results showed that, as these secondary structures grew tighter and tighter, CRISPRa performance gradually worsened (Figure S3B). Interestingly, this happened both when the secondary structure was localized to the dummy spacer and when it also involved the GFP-targeting gRNA’s repeat region. This indicated that CRISPR array performance is sensitive to both kinds of disruption. We then included the AAAT synSeparator to these worst-performing arrays and found that this significantly rescued CRISPRa performance in both cases (Figure S3B), suggesting that the separator acts both by insulating gRNAs from each other and by breaking up secondary structures that involve two consecutive gRNAs.</p><p>Third, we have performed an experiment to explore the possibility that there is a positional effect in a CRISPR array, such that a gRNA may perform differently depending on where in an array it is located. This experiment could indicate the extent to which global RNA structure affects gRNA function. We present these data in Figure S3C-D and an accompanying paragraph in the main text. We generated four CRISPR arrays, each containing one GFP-targeting gRNA and three non-targeting dummy gRNAs, and placed the GFP-targeting gRNA in each of the four positions. We made sure that the GFP-targeting gRNA would be preceded by the same dummy gRNA in as many arrays as possible, because different dummy gRNAs may have different propensities to generate secondary structures immediately upstream of the GFP-targeting gRNA, which would add variability. We found no positional effect in the performance of the GFP-targeting gRNA. This suggests that local RNA structure may be a more important determinant of gRNA performance than global RNA structure, at least in this experimental setting.</p><p>Fourth, we have performed a new computational analysis of spacer secondary structure using RNAfold, which contributes to a mechanistic understanding of CRISPR array processing in the context of high-GC spacers: We have assessed predicted secondary structure formation of the dummy spacers from Figure 1G (presented in the new Figure 1M). These results show that the performance of a GFP-targeting gRNA is anticorrelated with the predicted secondary structure of the upstream dummy spacer (Figure 1M). Interestingly, this anticorrelation was strongest when the structural prediction included both the non-targeting dummy spacer and the subsequent GFP gRNA (R<sup>2</sup> = 0.57; Figure 1M) rather than only the dummy spacer (R<sup>2</sup> = 0.27; Figure S1C), suggesting that secondary structures that directly involve the GFP-targeting gRNA may be particularly disruptive. Together with the experimental results described above (with the targeted mutations introduced into the dummy spacer), these results suggest that, even though secondary structures may be disruptive if they are confined to the upstream spacer, they may often be even more disruptive if they also involve the targeting gRNA itself.</p><p>Fifth, we present predicted secondary structures (RNAfold) from the two worst-performing CRISPR arrays from Figure 1G in new panels in Figure 3G-H. These structures suggest that the poor performance of these arrays may be caused by tight secondary structures that form between the dummy spacer and the GFP-targeting gRNA, which is likely to impair Cas12a processing (Figure 3H). Interestingly, both the natural L. bacterium separator and the AAAT synSeparator are predicted to break up these structures or form protrusions that may facilitate Cas12a access to its cleavage site. For example, structural ensemble diversity increases from 1.78 to 12.51 for this 50%-GC spacer, and from 7.07 to 12.43 for this 70%-GC spacer, when the full-length natural separator is included.</p><p>Taken together, all these new results indicate that the disruptive effect of high-GC spacers is likely caused by secondary structures (Figure 1M) that are either restricted to a single gRNA or involve two consecutive gRNAs (Figures 1M, S1C, S3A-B). CRISPR arrays containing such disruptive gRNAs are processed inefficiently by Cas12a (Figure 4B-E), which likely explains their poor performance. However, AT-rich separator sequences, even short, 4-nt sequences, can break up such secondary structures and give Cas12a access to its cleavage site (Figure 3H), improving CRISPR array processing (Figure 4) and performance (Figure 3D-J).</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>2. To show that synSeparators are broadly useful for multiplexed Cas12a applications, the authors should test additional targeting crRNA guides, ideally with the design informed by mechanistic insight from Essential Revision #1. The authors should also test crRNAs with synSeparators in another cell line and/or with a different Cas12a protein to further show generalizability.</p></disp-quote><p>We have addressed the generalizability of our findings with several new experiments:</p><p>First, we now include data demonstrating that a different nuclease-deactivated, enhanced-Cas12a from Acidaminococcus species (denAsCas12a; Kleinstiver et al., 2019) is also sensitive to the effects of high-GC spacers (Figure 3J). This poor performance was largely rescued by including a TTTT synSeparator derived from the natural AsCas12a separator (see Figure 2C). This experiment demonstrates that sensitivity to high-GC spacers is not specific to our particular Lb-dCas12a activator but is a general property of different Cas12a variants, consistent with the observation that all observed Cas12a arrays contain AT-rich separator sequences.</p><p>Second, we now include data demonstrating that the beneficial effect of adding a synSeparator is not limited to the AAAT sequence derived from the Lachnospiraceae b. separator. We now include three other 4-nt, AT-rich synSeparators derived from Acidaminococcus s. (TTTT), Moraxella b. (TTTA) and Prevotella d. (ATTT) (Figure 3I). All these synSeparators rescued the poor GFP activation caused by an upstream spacer with high GC content, demonstrating that the capacity to insulate neighboring gRNAs from each other is a general feature of AT-rich sequences. That said, these four synSeparators differed somewhat in the magnitude of GFP rescue they enabled (Figure 3I). This quantitative difference might be due to an intrinsic “insulation capacity” that differs between these sequences, or to the way they interact with the specific Lb-Cas12a protein used in this experiment, or to sequence-specific secondary structures within this particular CRISPR array. We discuss these possibilities in the Discussion.</p><p>Third, we attempted to investigate the effect of the synSeparator in different cell types. However, many cell types are difficult to transfect and dCas12a-VPR-mCherry is a big construct (&gt;6 kb). Either due to poor transfection efficiency or poor expression of the Cas12a activator construct, CRISPRa activity was consistently poor in these cell types, both with and without the synSeparator (e.g., we cannot observe fluorescence from the mCherry gene fused to the dCas12a activator, which we always see in HEK293T cells). Because of the low delivery efficiency of CRISPRa, it was not possible to evaluate the performance of the synSeparator. To our knowledge, there have not been many reports using dCas12a-VPR in cell types other than HEK293T. While we think that it will be important to optimize CRISPRa in many cell types (e.g., by optimizing transfection conditions, Cas12a variants, promoters, expression vectors, etc.), the focus of our study has been to show the separator’s mechanism and general function; we believe that optimizing general CRISPRa for different cell types is beyond the scope of this paper. We acknowledge that this is a limitation of our study and we have added a paragraph about this in the Discussion (line 355. All line numbers refer to the document with no markup visible). We nevertheless hypothesize that the negative influence of high-GC spacers and the insulating effect of synSeparators are generalizable across cell types. That is because we could observe improved array processing with the synSeparator even in the cell-free context of an in vitro expression system, as described above (Figure 4). This suggests that the sensitivity to spacer GC content is determined only by the interaction between Cas12a and the array, rather than being dependent on a particular cellular context.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Reviewer #1 (Recommendations for the authors):</p><p>Some additional literature should be integrated into manuscript. Fonfara Nature 2016 showed that Cpf1 encodes a distinct domain responsible for processing the transcribed CRISPR array into individual crRNAs. Liao Nat Commun 2019 showed that the order of the spacer in a CRISPR-Cas12a array can immensely impact multiplexed targeting, where targeting by one crRNA was strongly inhibited due to its repeat pairing with the upstream spacer. McCarty Nat Commun 2020 provided a comprehensive review of multiplexing approaches with CRISPR, including the use of CRISPR arrays.</p></disp-quote><p>We thank the reviewer for these suggestions. We have now included references to Fonfara et al. and McCarty et al. in the text (lines 43, 44). Regarding the Liao et al. reference, we have now performed an experiment exploring the positional effect of gRNAs in an array (Figure S3C-D). We observed no difference in GFP activation when a GFP-targeting gRNA was moved to each position in a 4-gRNA array, indicating that position is not necessarily an important determinant of gRNA performance. This finding is interesting considering the positional effect observed in Liao et al. We speculate that positional effects might be observed in cases where local secondary structures exist in some regions of an array but not in others. In such cases, positioning a gRNA in such a region may lead to decreased performance. We have included this discussion in the Results section (line 288).</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>To support general claims, the authors would need to show that the same trends persist when testing different guide sequences.

As the reviewer suspected, correlation between predicted RNA structure and array performance was indeed higher when the structural prediction included both the dummy spacer and the entire GFP-targeting gRNA (R<sup>2</sup> = 0.57; Figure 1M) than when it included only the dummy spacer (R<sup>2</sup> = 0.27; Figure S1C). This higher correlation suggests that secondary structures that involve the GFP-targeting gRNA play a more important role in our experiment than secondary structures that only involve the dummy spacer.

The data in Figure 1 correlate predicted secondary structure with crRNA activity. However, this relationship can be tested more directly. I would like to see targeted substitutions in the separator that are predicted to lead to specific changes in secondary structure at key positions around the Cas12a cleavage site.</p></disp-quote><p>We thank the reviewer for this suggestion. We have now performed the suggested experiment. We used our design of a 2-gRNA CRISPR array (Figure 1D) where the second gRNA targets the GFP promoter and the first gRNA contains a dummy spacer. We generated several versions of this array where we iteratively mutated the dummy spacer to either form a hairpin restricted to the dummy spacer, or a hairpin that would compete with the pseudoknot in the GFP-gRNA’s repeat region (Figure S3A-B). We found that each of these hairpins significantly reduced performance of the GFP-targeting gRNA. These results suggest that interfering with the pseudoknot indeed disrupts gRNA performance, but that also hairpins that presumably don’t interfere with the pseudoknot are detrimental – perhaps by sterically hindering Cas12a from accessing its cleavage site. Interestingly, the AAAT synSeparator partly rescues performance of the worst-performing of these constructs. These results are displayed in the new Figure S3 and discussed in the related part of the Results section.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>2. The authors speculate that the separator sequences affect Cas12a processing of the crRNAs, but they rely on indirect readouts of crRNA processing.

Using in vitro transcription, we generated RNA transcripts of one of the worst-performing two-gRNA arrays containing a 70% GC dummy spacer (see Figure 3A, D), either with or without the AAAT synSeparator upstream of each Cas12a cleavage site. We incubated this array with purified Lb-Cas12a protein for different amounts of time (2, 5, 10, 30, 60 minutes) and analyzed the cleavage products on a Bioanalyzer. The results showed that array processing occurred both in the presence and absence of the synSeparator but that it was more efficient with the synSeparator. As Cas12a incubation proceeded for longer times, more and more single gRNAs were excised, but for all processing times more single gRNAs had been processed in the array containing the synSeparator. Though the exact numbers may not correspond to what would be seen inside living cells, these results indicate that the synSeparator improves Cas12a processing efficiency and kinetics of CRISPR arrays.

We think that our data already provide an answer to this question: First, our data using a 2-gRNA array (Figure 1) show that if the last ~4 bases in the first spacer are GC-rich, they negatively influence performance of the downstream gRNA (Figure 1H-K). These GC-rich bases in effect act like GC-rich separators for the purpose of this question. Furthermore, replacing the AT-rich synSeparator with a single G can, in extreme cases, lead to severe malfunction of the subsequent gRNA (Figure 3D).

Please feel free to edit these subheadings if you think others would be more suitable.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>3. Figure 4E summarizes the data for the in vitro cleavage assay. However, to my eye at least, the data in panels B and C, and the data in the associated supplementary figure, don't match panel E. Specifically, without the SynSeparator, the largest increase in cleavage (shown in Figure 4E) occurs between 30 and 60 minutes. However, in panel B, there is almost no difference in the abundance of the 41/42 nt products between 30 and 60 minutes. Moreover, the kinetics of cleavage for the RNA without a SynSeparator are clearly delayed relative to the RNA with a SynSeparator, but cleavage appears to saturate after ~30 minutes (see also panels E and F of the supplementary figure, which to my eye are almost identical). Figure 4E suggests that only 20% of possible cleavage has occurred after 60 minutes for the RNA without a SynSeparator. If that is the case, why is it that cleavage appears to have saturated after 30 minutes? The authors need to present and describe these data more clearly, and potentially soften their conclusions.</p></disp-quote><p>Thank you for this insightful and important observation. We think there are two main questions in your comment.</p><p>The first is, why does there appear to be a discrepancy between Figures 4B and 4E, such that 4B suggests a saturation after 30 minutes while 4E suggests that the reaction has not saturated after 30 minutes. We think this apparent discrepancy has two explanations. First, the triplicate experiments that make up Figure 4E at each time point show variability. We have now updated Figure 4 (and uploaded it using the submission system) to include each data point in 4E, which highlights this variability better. For the array without the synSeparator, one can now see that the 60-minute time point consists of two data points that show reduced cleavage (only slightly higher than the 30-minute time point) and one data point that shows slightly higher cleavage. While the average value for the 60-minute time point is thus shifted slightly upward, the two lower data points may be more representative. In Figure 4B, each curve represents only one representative sample rather than the average of all three samples, as noted in the Figure 4B legend. Second, cleavage efficiency was calculated as the percentage of RNA contained in the 41/42-nt peak divided by total RNA in all cleavage peaks, as described in the Methods section. This means that the calculation is not only sensitive to an increase in the 41/42-nt peak but also to a decrease in larger cleavage products. It appears to be the case that the samples shown in Figure 4B (which are the same as shown in supplementary Figure 4E and F) show a slight decrease in the ~100-nt cleavage product at the 60-minute time point. This would make the 41/42-nt peak make up a larger fraction of the total RNA, even though the 41/42-nt peak appears not to be greater in size.</p><p>The second question is, why does the cleavage reaction appear to slow down or saturate already at 30 minutes, despite the excess of Cas12a molecules relative to RNA molecules? We don’t have an answer to this question but speculate that this could be due to a decrease in available Cas12a molecules with time. Because Cas12a remains bound to its gRNA after processing, the amount of freely available Cas12a molecules decreases as the processing reaction proceeds. Perhaps processing of the recalcitrant high-GC gRNAs requires is so unfavorable that it requires a high excess of Cas12a protein to take place. In this scenario, cleavage would become less and less efficient as the amount of freely available Cas12a molecules decreases. We have added this speculation in the Discussion: “… the reaction appears to slow down after 30 minutes, possibly due to the lower concentration of available Cas12a molecules as more and more Cas12a molecules become sequestered by their RNA cleavage products and unavailable to participate in further processing events.”</p><p>We hope that these changes facilitate a clearer interpretation of our data.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>4. The authors should use more precise language when describing changes in predicted secondary structure, making clear that these are predictions. For example, rather than saying &quot;as these secondary structures grew tighter, CRISPRa performance gradually worsened&quot;, I suggest &quot;as the predicted extent of base-pairing increased, CRISPRa performance gradually worsened&quot;.</p></disp-quote><p>We have performed the suggested change.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>5.
