Each of these operations is carried out across a network of distributed brain regions. How multiple distributed processes are facilitated in parallel is largely unknown. We postulate that such processing relies on a multiplex of dynamic network patterns emerging in parallel but from different functional connectivity (FC) timescales. Given the dominance of inherently slow fMRI in network science, it is unknown whether the brain leverages such multi-timescale network dynamics. We studied FC dynamics concurrently across a breadth of timescales (from infraslow to γ-range) in rare, simultaneously recorded intracranial EEG and fMRI in humans, and source-localized scalp EEG-fMRI data in humans. We examined spatial and temporal convergence of connectome trajectories across timescales. ‘Spatial convergence’ refers to spatially similar EEG and fMRI connectome patterns, while ‘temporal convergence’ signifies the more specific case of spatial convergence at corresponding timepoints in EEG and fMRI. We observed spatial convergence but temporal divergence across FC timescales; connectome states (recurrent FC patterns) with partial spatial similarity were found in fMRI and all EEG frequency bands, but these occurred asynchronously across FC timescales. Our findings suggest that hemodynamic and frequency-specific electrophysiological signals, while involving similar large-scale networks, represent functionally distinct connectome trajectories that operate at different FC speeds and in parallel. This multiplex is poised to enable concurrent connectivity across multiple sets of brain regions independently.</p></abstract><kwd-group kwd-group-type="author-keywords"><kwd>functinoal connectome</kwd><kwd>intracranial EEG</kwd><kwd>fMRI</kwd><kwd>concurrent</kwd><kwd>connectome dynamics</kwd><kwd>multiplex</kwd></kwd-group><kwd-group kwd-group-type="research-organism"><title>Research organism</title><kwd>Human</kwd></kwd-group><funding-group><award-group id="fund1"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100001711</institution-id><institution>Swiss National Science Foundation</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>192749</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Vulliemoz</surname><given-names>Serge</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund2"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100000265</institution-id><institution>Medical Research Council, United Kingdom</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>G0301067</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Lemieux</surname><given-names>Louis</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund3"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution>National Institute for Mental Health</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>1R01MH116226</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Sadaghiani</surname><given-names>Sepideh</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund4"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100001711</institution-id><institution>Swiss National Science Foundation</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>CRSII5_209470</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Vulliemoz</surname><given-names>Serge</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><funding-statement>The funders had no role in study design, data collection and interpretation, or the decision to submit the work for publication.</funding-statement></funding-group><custom-meta-group><custom-meta specific-use="meta-only"><meta-name>Author impact statement</meta-name><meta-value>Parallel connectome trajectories unfold asynchronously across timescales, sustaining a multiplex of functionally distinct brain networks operating at different speeds.</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta specific-use="meta-only"><meta-name>publishing-route</meta-name><meta-value>prc</meta-value></custom-meta></custom-meta-group></article-meta></front><body><sec id="s1" sec-type="intro"><title>Introduction</title><p>Numerous distributed neural processes unfold in parallel in support of complex brain function. Speech comprehension, for example, requires concurrent processing of phonemes, syllables, and sentence-level prosody, syntax, and semantics. An essential characteristic of such parallel processes is that they occur at different timescales (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib45">Kahneman, 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib62">Perdikis et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">Hari and Parkkonen, 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib46">Kringelbach et al., 2015</xref>), in the case of speech spanning from tens of milliseconds (phonemes), over hundreds of milliseconds (syllables), to several seconds (sentences). Irrespective of timescale, each of these subprocesses relies on a distributed set of functionally connected brain regions. Given the parallel nature and different timescales of the subprocesses, FC among multiple sets of regions and at multiple speeds may be required in parallel. However, due to the dominance of inherently slow fMRI in the study of FC, it is unknown whether the brain’s connectivity architecture supports such multi-timescale connectivity.</p><p>The functional connectome constitutes the whole-brain spatial organization of large-scale FC and is thought to represent the brain’s omnipresent and intrinsic ‘cognitive architecture’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib63">Petersen and Sporns, 2015</xref>). This spatial organization continuously exhibits reconfigurations across different spatial patterns in all mental states, including task-free rest. These reconfigurations are referred to as spontaneous or ongoing FC dynamics (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib65">Preti et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib49">Lurie et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib75">Sadaghiani and Wirsich, 2020</xref>). Such ongoing FC dynamics as observed in both fMRI and electrophysiology are associated with cognitive performance (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib85">Weisz et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib74">Sadaghiani et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Cohen, 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib69">Rassi et al., 2019</xref>). More specifically, spontaneously occurring FC dynamics include certain patterns thought to represent distinct discrete connectome states supporting different cognitively and behaviorally relevant processes; Thus, iteration through these states may be commensurate with maintaining cognitive flexibility during all cognitive states including rest (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Bassett et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Deco et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Chen et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib83">Vohryzek et al., 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Alavash et al., 2021</xref>).</p><p>The functional connectome is commonly studied with fMRI as it offers whole-brain coverage and precise localization. The discovery of intrinsic large-scale FC organization around the turn of the millennium (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Biswal et al., 1995</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">Greicius et al., 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Damoiseaux et al., 2006</xref>) and its time-varying dynamics over the following two decades (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Chang and Glover, 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib50">Majeed et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">Handwerker et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Allen et al., 2014</xref>) were based on fMRI data. It is perhaps for this reason that the literature commonly treats functional connectome dynamics as conceptually synonymous with these fMRI-derived observations. However, while fMRI is limited to the infraslow timescale of the hemodynamic response, it is rarely considered whether large-scale functional connectome dynamics comprise other FC processes not readily measurable in fMRI.</p><p>Beyond fMRI, a small but growing body of work suggests that the functional connectome can be reliably observed using electrophysiological methods such as MEG, EEG, and intracranial EEG (iEEG) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Brookes et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib75">Sadaghiani and Wirsich, 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib76">Sadaghiani et al., 2022</xref>). Theoretically, FC as captured by fMRI and electrophysiology is partly distinct with respect to the underlying neural populations, connectivity mechanisms, and timescales. Specifically, while the Local Field Potential signal of electrophysiological methods including intracranial recordings is dominated by pyramidal neurons (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Buzsáki et al., 2012</xref>), the fMRI signal stems from the metabolic demands of neural activity that can cumulatively reflect a large variety of neural populations (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib41">Heeger and Ress, 2002</xref>). Regarding FC in particular, fMRI and electrophysiological recordings differ in terms of both speed and connectivity mechanisms; fMRI captures connectivity based on slow co-fluctuations of the hemodynamic signal, thus resulting in connectome dynamics in the range of seconds to minutes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Chang and Glover, 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Calhoun et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib83">Vohryzek et al., 2020</xref>). Conversely, connectivity inferred from electrophysiological data is commonly based on cross-region coupling of phase or amplitude of fast neural processes (~1–150 Hz), resulting in connectome dynamics at sub-second speeds (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Baker et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib44">Hunyadi et al., 2019</xref>). Such sub-second dynamics are thought to enable frequency-specific modes of rapid neural communication (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Engel et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib55">Mostame and Sadaghiani, 2021</xref>).</p><p>Given that spontaneous connectome dynamics as observed in <italic>separate</italic> fMRI and electrophysiological experiments may stem from partially distinct neural populations and FC timescales (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib60">Nunez and Silberstein, 2000</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">Hari and Parkkonen, 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib42">Hermes et al., 2017</xref>), a fundamental question arises: Could the connectome entail more than one FC pattern at any given timepoint? It is conceivable that multiple connectome state sequences, or dynamic trajectories, concurrently unfold at different timescales and serve as parallel ‘channels’ of FC. In this scenario, any given brain region may concurrently undergo dynamic connectivity to <italic>multiple</italic> distinct sets of other regions, with a different FC timescale for each set. This scenario may minimize interference and maximize information flow. We liken this multitude of communication channels to multiplexing in telecommunication, where independent information streams are conveyed through a single radio or television transmission medium. Such a multiplex would be ideally poised to support the multitude of cognitively relevant processes that occur at numerous speeds in parallel. To empirically assess whether the brain contains such a multiplex, all timescales of FC connectivity must be investigated concurrently, therefore, calling for multi-modal approaches.</p><p>Multimodal studies have begun to directly investigate the relationship between hemodynamics- and electrophysiology-derived large-scale FC (e.g. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib40">He et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">de Pasquale et al., 2010</xref>). This line of work shows that the <italic>time-averaged or static</italic> spatial organization of functional connectomes is (at least moderately) correlated between fMRI and electrophysiological data, including MEG (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Brookes et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib43">Hipp and Siegel, 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib78">Shafiei et al., 2022</xref>), EEG (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Deligianni et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib86">Wirsich et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib88">Wirsich et al., 2021</xref>), and iEEG (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib47">Kucyi et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Betzel et al., 2019</xref>). However, the <italic>temporal</italic> relationship of connectome dynamics across FC timescales, which requires concurrent fMRI and electrophysiological recordings, has rarely been studied. Understanding this temporal relationship will determine whether the brain leverages a multiplex of communication channels.</p><p>To understand the relationship of connectome dynamics across FC timescales, we measure the degree to which simultaneously recorded fMRI- and electrophysiology-derived connectome trajectories converge. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1</xref> illustrates three possible scenarios. In scenario I, spatially similar connectome patterns occur in the two modalities at the same time once accounting for the hemodynamic delay (i.e. are spatially and temporally convergent). This scenario aligns with the common assumption that electrophysiological and hemodynamic measurements mostly show the same neural functional connectivity processes. The latter, in this perspective, essentially records a smoothed-out version (specifically convolved with the Hemodynamic Response Function or HRF) of the former. However, the above-described divergence of the neurophysiological bases of EEG and fMRI signals warrant alternative scenarios. In particular, in scenario II spatially similar connectome patterns occur in the two data modalities; however, at different timepoints (spatially convergent but temporally divergent). Conversely, in scenario III connectome patterns of the two modalities bear no spatial resemblance (spatially and temporally divergent). Note that a fourth scenario of temporally convergent but spatially dissimilar FC patterns is theoretically possible but is outside of our scope due to the infinite search space. We adjudicate these scenarios in a frame-by-frame manner, first in rare human concurrent fMRI and iEEG data providing optimal spatial precision (N=9, including individual non-parametric testing against subject-specific null models), then extending to whole-brain connectomes using a concurrent <italic>source-localized</italic> scalp EEG and fMRI dataset (N=26).</p><fig-group><fig id="fig1" position="float"><label>Figure 1.</label><caption><title>Three potential scenarios for convergence/divergence of connectome trajectories across hemodynamics and electrophysiology.</title><p>Dynamics of connectome reconfigurations (i.e. time-varying spatial patterns of large-scale connectivity) are shown as trajectories (functional connectivity, FC pattern sequences) in a presumed 3D state space, starting from the diamond sign and ending at the arrowhead. Hemodynamics- and electrophysiology-derived connectome dynamics in each scenario are shown in blue and red, respectively. Scenario (<bold>I</bold>): both dynamic trajectories are driven by the same connectivity processes; are spatially and temporally convergent (at all times). Scenario (II): both dynamic trajectories span the same portion of the state space, while each traversing a different timecourse; are spatially convergent but temporally divergent. Scenario (III): each of the dynamic trajectories spans non-overlapping parts of the state space with different timecourses; are spatially and temporally divergent (at all times). Note that scenarios I and III represent border cases extracted from a theoretical convergence/divergence gradient (bottom of the figure). Spatial convergence does not imply a perfect spatial match (at the same or different time points).

For fMRI-iEEG data, the group-average skewness along fMRI axis (Skewness = 1.60 ± 0.65) was significantly higher than along the multi-frequency iEEG-FC<sub>Amp</sub> axis (Skewness = 0.49 ± 0.36; paired t-test between axes and across subjects: t<sub>8</sub>=4.05 p=0.0018).

Importantly, the higher skewness along the horizontal (fMRI) axis than the vertical (iEEG/EEG) axis was observed in individuals (7 out of 9 and 25 out of 26 subjects, respectively in iEEG-fMRI and EEG-fMRI datasets). Thus, the spatial similarity during the stripes occurs largely because of spatial characteristics that are present in electrophysiology in a stable manner over time, and are shared across frequency bands (since stripes were stronger when all frequency-specific CRPs were combined).

Specifically, we quantified the ratio of on-diagonal to off-diagonal rates (hereinafter ‘<italic>on-/off-diagonal ratio.’</italic> See <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3C</xref>). In scenario I, fMRI and iEEG connectome trajectories are temporally aligned, hence spatially converging more commonly at synchronous than asynchronous timepoints. Thus, epochs of cross-modal spatial similarity should occur more frequently at on-diagonal (synchronous) than off-diagonal (asynchronous) entries, resulting in an on-/off-diagonal ratio larger than unity (ratio &gt;&gt;1). In scenario II, however, epochs of spatial similarity could occur equally likely at on-diagonal and off-diagonal entries (ratio ≈ 1) akin to a random multi-frequency CRP (see section ‘Validation of On-/Off-diagonal ratio metric’ in Appendix 1). Thus, we compared each subject's on-/off-diagonal ratio to a null distribution of ratios extracted after spatially scrambling the multi-frequency CRP along both temporal axes for 100 repetitions.

In particular, if fMRI and EEG merely provided two different windows onto the same underlying processes, one would expect these processes to appear in the two data modalities around the same time (albeit with a possible delay). Instead, the observed <italic>asynchronicity</italic> of spatially similar connectome patterns is in line with the viewpoint that the data modalities are more sensitive to different aspects of neural processing. This view aligns with the standpoint that electrophysiology better captures neural activity involving fast-conducting (i.e. thick, myelinated) fibers, while fMRI prominently reflects neural ensembles connected via slow (i.e. thin, unmyelinated) fibers (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">Hari and Parkkonen, 2015</xref>). According to this standpoint, each type of neural process, slow and fast, subserves cognitive processes at different speeds, suggesting that each modality better captures particular aspects of behavioral neural correlates (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">Hari and Parkkonen, 2015</xref>). Extending this view to connectomics, distinct connectome patterns reflecting partly non-overlapping FC processes could dominate the signals in hemodynamic and electrophysiological acquisition methods, respectively.</p><p>This perspective could also explain why spatial similarity across hemodynamics and electrophysiological connectomes rarely surpass a small effect size. These effect sizes are consistently small for cross-modal comparisons in both static (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Betzel et al., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib88">Wirsich et al., 2021</xref>) as well as time-varying connectomes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib87">Wirsich et al., 2020</xref>). In line with these prior reports, we acknowledge that the cross-modal spatial similarity of connectome frames is small albeit above chance in the current study. The small effect size implies that beyond the common spatial patterns, connectome-wide co-activation patterns contain a substantial amount of variance that is unique to each data modality and FC timescale (i.e. part of the variance aligns with scenario III). From the above-described standpoint of partly distinct neural substrates, the diverging variance in EEG and fMRI is at least partly neural in nature.</p><p>Prior multi-modal studies of neural dynamics have predominantly aimed at methodologically cross-validating hemodynamic and electrophysiological observations, thus focusing on their convergence. These important foundational studies include e.g., the cross-modal comparison of region-wise (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib57">Mukamel et al., 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib59">Nir et al., 2007</xref>) or ICN-wise (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib51">Mantini et al., 2007</xref>) activity fluctuations, instantaneous activity maps (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib44">Hunyadi et al., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib91">Zhang et al., 2020</xref>) or EEG microstates (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib82">Van de Ville et al., 2010</xref>), infraslow connectome states (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Abreu et al., 2020</xref>), or connection-wise FC including studies in the iEEG-fMRI and scalp EEG-fMRI data used in the current study (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib70">Ridley et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib87">Wirsich et al., 2020</xref>, respectively). In contrast to this prior work, the current study investigated the highly time-resolved cross-modal temporal relationship at the level of FC <italic>patterns</italic> distributed over all available pairwise connections, and found a <italic>connectome-level</italic> temporal divergence. The discrepancy between temporal divergence in our study and convergence in prior studies implies that infraslow fluctuations of activity in <italic>individual</italic> regions or of FC in individual region-pairs observable in both modalities (prior studies) are neurally distinct from <italic>connectome-wide</italic> FC dynamics observable separately in each modality (current study). Indeed, we confirmed the existence of infraslow electrophysiological FC dynamics driving cross-modal temporal associations at the level of individual connections (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s2">Figure 3—figure supplement 2</xref>). Of note, this significant temporal association occurred across many but not all connections, leaving room for dissociation at the level of large-scale FC patterns. Generative models may shed light on the factors underlying the dissociation of connectivity processes at the level of connectome patterns versus individual connections (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Deco et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Cabral et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib68">Rabuffo et al., 2021</xref>).</p><p>Another core conclusion pertains to the rich multi-frequency signature of the cross-modal relationship. Specifically, in both synchronous and asynchronous approaches, hemodynamic FC configurations spatially converged with electrophysiological FC patterns in all canonical frequency bands and did so at largely non-overlapping timepoints across bands. Similarly, in our clustering approach, all four fMRI connectome states matched with specific EEG connectome states in all frequency bands, rather than each individual fMRI state being tied to a specific EEG frequency band. This observation is in line with our independent, unimodal iEEG study, showing that the connection-wise dynamics of electrophysiological FC are temporally independent across frequency bands (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib55">Mostame and Sadaghiani, 2021</xref>). These observations suggest that electrophysiological connectome dynamics do not constitute a unitary FC process, but rather a set of frequency-specific FC processes unfolding in a dissociable and complementary manner. Note that although our approach was motivated by frameworks of oscillation-based FC mechanisms (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Engel et al., 2013</xref>), our conclusion of frequency-specificity does not hinge upon exclusively oscillatory processes and is also compatible with aperiodic fluctuations (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">Donoghue et al., 2020</xref>).</p><p>Overall, the co-existence of multiple distinct connectivity processes across timescales (from fMRI to faster electrophysiological frequency bands) may be conceptualized as a multiplex system. A multiplex architecture allows the system nodes (here brain regions) to connect to one another over multiple layers, where each layer represents a type (here timescale) of connectivity. In this conceptualization, the brain leverages the co-existing timescale-specific communication channels to yield a maximized bandwidth for information flow at any given time. As an example, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5</xref> illustrates the overall connectivity strength of the Default Mode (DM) and Visual (Vis) ICNs over time and across timescales, for a single subject. Note that scalp EEG-fMRI data was used for this purpose given its full-cortex coverage. It is apparent that each of these networks dominates the FC pattern at different timepoints across timescales, supporting the above-described multiplex nature of the brain connectome dynamics.</p><sec id="s3-1"><title>Limitations</title><p>The hemodynamic response of the brain bounded the temporal resolution of the results. However, this methodological limitation of fMRI may produce high sensitivity to particularly slow brain processes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">Hari and Parkkonen, 2015</xref>). Similarly, while the temporal resolution of iEEG connectivity was high, it was subject to the temporal smoothing effect of the estimation window. Oscillation-based connectivity requires several oscillation cycles to yield a reliable connectivity estimate thus necessitating an estimation window of several seconds in continuous recordings. While the EEG estimation window may be considered a methodological limitation, it aligns with the neurobiological viewpoint that several oscillation cycles are needed for cross-region synchronization to be functionally effective.</p><p>Another consideration is that we could not reliably investigate high-frequency broadband (‘high-γ’ band; &gt;60 Hz) range, because concurrently recorded iEEG is disproportionately affected by MR-related artifacts in higher frequencies (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib58">Mullinger and Bowtell, 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib52">Mele et al., 2019</xref>). Static FC based on high-frequency broadband amplitude fluctuations may match fMRI-derived FC particularly well (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib47">Kucyi et al., 2018</xref>) and could potentially result in connectome dynamics temporally convergent with those in fMRI (if their concurrent measurements were feasible). Importantly, however, this possibility is not inconsistent with our observations that electrophysiological FC patterns in delta through gamma bands constitute parallel dynamics that are temporally independent of each other and of fMRI.</p><p>The limited spatial sampling (coverage) of iEEG electrodes in patients with epilepsy - dictated by clinical considerations- is another important limitation. Nonetheless, we were able to replicate our findings in the absence of such limited spatial sampling by leveraging whole-brain source-localized EEG-fMRI recordings. In iEEG data, volume conduction effects are minimal (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib71">Rouse et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">Dubey and Ray, 2019</xref>) and source leakage correction was performed in the source-localized EEG recordings (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Colclough et al., 2015</xref>). It should be noted, however, that even state-of-the-art volume conduction mitigation strategies cannot distinguish artefactual zero-phase lag from genuine zero-phase lag neural activity. To mitigate this issue, we provide results from source-localized data both with and without leakage correction (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s3">Figure 3—figure supplement 3</xref> and main text, respectively).</p></sec><sec id="s3-2"><title>Conclusions</title><p>Based on our multi-modal observations, we reconceptualize the functional connectome as a composite process that engages a shared repertoire of recurrent configurations across a maximally broad range of timescales (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5A</xref>). This process is akin to frequency multiplexing in radio and television broadcasting where multiple streams of information are transmitted simultaneously over one communication system (the telecommunication network), taking advantage of distinct bands across the frequency domain. In this conceptualization, information flow is maximized as the connectome can concurrently take advantage of several connectivity states at any given moment (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5B</xref>). Such multiplexed FC architecture is thus optimally poised to support the multiple speeds of complex brain function. To conclude, our findings conceptually advance the understanding of the functional capabilities that large-scale connectivity affords. This advance motivates the use of multimodal approaches in future connectomics research to accommodate the multi-timescale nature of FC.</p></sec></sec><sec id="s4" sec-type="methods"><title>Methods</title><p>This study quantifies the spatial and temporal convergence of dynamic reconfigurations of connectomes driven by different FC timescales (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1</xref>).

Then, the BOLD signal timecourse at each voxel was detrended and filtered (0.01–0.08 Hz). Using Marsbar toolbox in SPM (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://marsbar.sourceforge.net/">http://marsbar.sourceforge.net/</ext-link>), spurious signal variations were removed by regressing out the signals of lateral ventricles and the deep cerebral white matter. After preprocessing, functional data was co-registered to the structural T1-weighted scan of the subject. Then at the location of each iEEG electrode (see below), the BOLD signals of adjacent voxels within a 5 mm radius was averaged to generate the region of interest (ROI) BOLD signal corresponding to that iEEG electrode (Similar to <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib47">Kucyi et al., 2018</xref>).

Then, the MNI location of the electrodes in each subject was calculated (shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1</xref>). Intracranial EEG data was corrected for gradient and cardio-ballistic artifacts using Brain Vision Analyzer software (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Allen et al., 2000</xref>) and down-sampled to 250 Hz. Proceeding with a spike detection analysis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Bettus et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib70">Ridley et al., 2017</xref>), electrodes that were marked by clinicians as involved in generating seizures or generating interictal spikes were excluded from further analyses. To remove slow drifts, line noise, and high-frequency noise, the data was filtered with a fourth-order high-pass Butterworth filter at 0.5 Hz, a sixth-order notch filter at 50 Hz, and a fourth-order low-pass Butterworth filter at 90 Hz, respectively. Since the interpretation of white matter BOLD signals is debated (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">Gawryluk et al., 2014</xref>), depth electrodes that were implanted in the white matter (and their corresponding fMRI ROIs) were excluded from the analyses. For this purpose, we excluded electrodes that were embedded outside of SPM’s gray matter template mask in MNI space. Additionally, electrodes with remaining jump artifacts, highly prevalent periods of epileptiform activity, or low SNR were removed by visual inspections under supervision of an epileptologist. After this cleaning procedure, electrodes were re-referenced to the common average. Note that in order to preserve temporal continuity of the concurrent recordings, we did not exclude time intervals of the iEEG data that contained additional interictal activity in the healthy brain regions. However, to ensure that interictal activity had no critical effect on our findings, we generalized our observations in a non-clinical population (source-localized EEG-fMRI dataset) and further statistically demonstrated in the intracranial data the temporal independence of cross-modal similarity of connectome dynamics from visually marked epochs of interictal activity (19 ± 15% of data length) (see section ‘Addressing alternative sources of contribution’ in the Appendix 1).</p></sec><sec id="s4-2-2"><title>Scalp EEG-fMRI dataset</title><p>fMRI and EEG data were preprocessed with standard preprocessing steps as explained in detail elsewhere (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib87">Wirsich et al., 2020</xref>).

The cortex was parcellated into 68 regions of the Desikan-Kiliany atlas (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Desikan et al., 2006</xref>).

Furthermore, we quantified temporal overlap of the binary timecourse of intervals of visually marked epileptiform activity and the binarized (significance-thresholded) timecourse of cross-modal spatial similarity using the Jaccard index. We compared the outcome to a corresponding null distribution extracted from a temporally-shifted (by a random number of samples between 1 and the length of the original timecourse) version of the binarized cross-modal spatial similarity timecourse (see subplots D in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7s1">Figure 7—figure supplement 1</xref>; group-level <italic>t</italic>-test against subject-specific mean values of 100 surrogate samples). Finally, we replicated our major findings in the scalp data using source-orthogonalized signals to show that our findings are largely independent of source leakage (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s3">Figure 3—figure supplement 3</xref>). Particularly, this approach removes any zero-lag temporal correlation between every pair of electrode signals using a multi-variate orthogonalization process so that any spurious correlation due to volume conduction would be minimized (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Colclough et al., 2015</xref>).</p></sec></sec></sec></body><back><sec sec-type="additional-information" id="s5"><title>Additional information</title><fn-group content-type="competing-interest"><title>Competing interests</title><fn fn-type="COI-statement" id="conf1"><p>No competing interests declared</p></fn></fn-group><fn-group content-type="author-contribution"><title>Author contributions</title><fn fn-type="con" id="con1"><p>Conceptualization, Data curation, Software, Formal analysis, Validation, Investigation, Visualization, Methodology, Writing – original draft, Writing – review and editing</p></fn><fn fn-type="con" id="con2"><p>Conceptualization, Data curation, Software, Formal analysis, Methodology, Writing – review and editing</p></fn><fn fn-type="con" id="con3"><p>Conceptualization, Data curation, Software, Formal analysis, Investigation, Methodology, Writing – review and editing</p></fn><fn fn-type="con" id="con4"><p>Conceptualization, Data curation, Software, Formal analysis, Investigation, Methodology, Writing – review and editing</p></fn><fn fn-type="con" id="con5"><p>Conceptualization, Resources, Data curation, Supervision, Funding acquisition, Investigation, Project administration, Writing – review and editing</p></fn><fn fn-type="con" id="con6"><p>Conceptualization, Resources, Data curation, Supervision, Funding acquisition, Investigation, Methodology, Project administration, Writing – review and editing</p></fn><fn fn-type="con" id="con7"><p>Conceptualization, Resources, Data curation, Supervision, Funding acquisition, Investigation, Methodology, Project administration, Writing – review and editing</p></fn><fn fn-type="con" id="con8"><p>Conceptualization, Resources, Data curation, Supervision, Funding acquisition, Investigation, Methodology, Project administration, Writing – review and editing</p></fn><fn fn-type="con" id="con9"><p>Conceptualization, Resources, Data curation, Supervision, Funding acquisition, Investigation, Methodology, Project administration, Writing – review and editing</p></fn><fn fn-type="con" id="con10"><p>Conceptualization, Resources, Data curation, Supervision, Funding acquisition, Validation, Investigation, Visualization, Methodology, Writing – original draft, Project administration, Writing – review and editing</p></fn></fn-group><fn-group content-type="ethics-information"><title>Ethics</title><fn fn-type="other"><p>Intracranial EEG-fMRI dataset: The data has been originally introduced elsewhere (Ridley et al., 2017).

of time-averaged connectome configurations</title><p>Prior findings have provided evidence suggesting a robust spatial similarity between the static connectome organization of fMRI and electrophysiology at the group level. In addition to replicating such findings in group-averaged scalp EEG-fMRI connectomes, we replicated these results particularly at the individual level leveraging our unique concurrent intracranial EEG and fMRI data.</p><p>In scalp EEG-fMRI data, cross-modal spatial (2D) Pearson correlation of group-level time-averaged connectomes between fMRI and EEG-FC<sub>Amp</sub> or fMRI and EEG-FC<sub>Phase</sub> were calculated across all frequency bands. The average spatial correlation value across frequency bands <italic>r</italic>=0.28 and <italic>r</italic>=0.28 for EEG-FC<sub>Amp</sub> and EEG-FC<sub>Phase</sub>, respectively. The spatial correlation values across all frequency bands and connectivity measures were significantly higher than the corresponding null distributions generated by phase-permuted group-level fMRI-FC spatial organization (p&lt;0.005; 200 repetitions; FDR-corrected at q&lt;0.05 for the number of frequency bands).</p><p>Similarly, in intracranial EEG-fMRI data, cross-modal spatial correlation values of fMRI and iEEG static connectomes of each subject was calculated across frequency bands for both phase- and amplitude-coupling measures (averaged across subjects and frequency bands: <italic>r</italic>=0.21 and <italic>r</italic>=0.20 for EEG-FC<sub>Amp</sub> and EEG-FC<sub>Phase</sub>, respectively). Subject-specific null distributions in each frequency band and connectivity measure were extracted using phase-permuted FC matrices similar to above. In each frequency band, at the group level, there was a significant effect when comparing subject-specific correlation values with their corresponding average null correlation values. For fMRI-FC to iEEG-FC<sub>Amp</sub>, the t-values of the five frequency bands (δ to γ) were: one-sided t<sub>8</sub>=2.82, 4.91, 6.19, 5.44, and 6.16 (p&lt;0.011; FDR-corrected at q&lt;0.05 for the number of frequency bands). For fMRI-FC to iEEG-FC<sub>Phase</sub>, the corresponding values were: one-sided t<sub>8</sub>=2.71, 3.99, 4.79, 4.36, and 2.67 (p&lt;0.014). Altogether, these results suggest that the spatial organization of the intrinsic (‘static’) architecture in hemodynamics- and electrophysiology-derived connectomes are weakly but significantly correlated. Of note, the small effect sizes are strongly in line with prior literature and may point to possible divergence in the dynamic domain as investigated in the main manuscript.</p></sec><sec sec-type="appendix" id="s9"><title>Attractors for the cross-modal association</title><p>Viewing canonical frequencies from a complimentary perspective reveals another prominent feature of the cross-modal relationship. Specifically, in the multi-frequency CRP, we observed horizontal stripes constructed from non-overlapping frequency-specific epochs of cross-modal spatial convergence (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2B</xref>). This finding implies that at particular timepoints, the fMRI-derived connectome configuration spatially converges with a component in EEG connectomes that is shared across frequency bands over a large proportion of timepoints. While there is also a degree of vertical stripiness in some multi-frequency CRPs, we quantitatively established the prominence of horizontal CRP stripes in 7/9 of the subjects (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s1">Figure 3—figure supplement 1A</xref>, top). We quantitatively confirmed that the stripes largely correspond to the stable, i.e., static, component of iEEG connectome (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s1">Figure 3—figure supplement 1B–C</xref>). Specifically, we demonstrated the emergence of equivalent stripes in multi-frequency ‘pseudo-CRPs’ derived from the original fMRI-FC timeseries and a constant timeseries of the time-averaged (static) iEEG connectome. These observations imply that the intrinsic electrophysiological FC component serves as an attractor for the cross-modal spatiotemporal convergence. The considerable number of significant CRP epochs outside the stripes, however, raises the question of whether fMRI and iEEG share spatial patterns distinct from the static connectome attractor, possibly in the form of dissociable recurrent states (see section ‘Cross-modal convergence arises from discrete recurrent connectome states’ in the main text).</p><p>The above-mentioned findings from the dynamic domain provide insight into the static domain. For instance, it has been demonstrated that considering FC matrices of all canonical frequency bands collectively, as opposed to individually, improved prediction of the (group-average) fMRI-derived static connectome. This dovetails with our findings, which suggests that moment-to-moment connectome configurations in individual frequencies each contribute to the static fMRI-derived connectome organization at independent timepoints. In other words, the static fMRI-derived connectome organization comprises the cumulative pattern of all temporally dissociated frequency-specific electrophysiological FC states ‘compressed’ into a time-averaged architecture.</p></sec><sec sec-type="appendix" id="s10"><title>Edge-wise association of infraslow FC fluctuations across fMRI and iEEG</title><p>In this section, we aimed to confirm presence of the well-known electrophysiological basis of fMRI signals in our intracranial EEG-fMRI dataset. Particularly, our CRP analysis suggests that fMRI and iEEG connectome patterns spatially reconfigure along largely independent trajectories. However, ample prior evidence suggests that, at the level of individual connections rather than distributed FC patterns, fMRI-FC has an electrophysiological basis readily measurable in iEEG and scalp EEG (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib61">Pan et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib87">Wirsich et al., 2020</xref>). To counter any apparent contradiction between our findings and this prior work, we investigated the temporal associations between time-varying fMRI-FC and iEEG-FC at each connection using the Mutual information index. Note that while iEEG-FC in our study is derived after band-pass filtering the channel-wise raw signal timecourse in the frequency band of canonical oscillations (δ to γ), the strength of cross-channel FC has a broad spectrum with strong power in the infraslow range. We investigated these temporal associations across region pairs between fMRI connectivity and iEEG connectivity extracted from HRF-convolved amplitude changes of bandlimited iEEG recordings. As shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s2">Figure 3—figure supplement 2</xref>, we found that a considerable percentage of connections show temporally associated dynamics across fMRI-FC and iEEG-FC<sub>Amp</sub> of all canonical frequency bands (delta through gamma: 34 ± 21%, 46 ± 19%, 47 ± 21%, 38 ± 25%, 30 ± 23%; cumulatively across all bands: 81 ± 24%). Importantly, convergence rates increased considerably when accumulated across all frequency bands. This observation speaks to the presence of <italic>multi-frequency</italic> association of fMRI and iEEG FC changes at the level of connections. These findings are in line with the observed cross-modal multi-frequency association at the level of connectomes.</p><p>Altogether, our findings describe two complementary aspects of FC. We confirm a readily measurable electrophysiological basis for the inherently infraslow fMRI-FC fluctuations at the connection-wise level. At the same time, we reveal additional FC phenomena that are apparent as distributed FC patterns and are temporally independent across fMRI and iEEG/EEG, thus likely capturing independent neural processes (see Discussion).</p></sec><sec sec-type="appendix" id="s11"><title>Addressing alternative sources of contribution</title><p>Source leakage, i.e., the simultaneous detection of a brain signals from one source at several sensors, may cause spurious connectivity between electrode pairs and, therefore, distort estimation of FC matrices (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib77">Schoffelen and Gross, 2009</xref>). Given that intracranial EEG with macro electrodes does not suffer from source leakage (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Badier and Chauvel, 1995</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">Dubey and Ray, 2019</xref>), our main findings cannot be driven by volume conduction effects. For the concurrent source-localized EEG-fMRI data, all results were replicated after minimizing source leakage using a state-of-the-art correction procedure, i.e., orthogonalization of source signals (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7s1">Figure 7—figure supplement 1</xref>).</p><p>In addition to source leakage, other sources of artifacts exist that may have affected our findings. Here, we show that our findings are independent of such confounding factors or artifacts. Specifically, we quantified the association of the cross-modal similarity timecourses (as exemplified in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2B</xref>) with: (i) distance to time-averaged FC, (ii) overall FC strength, (iii) head motion, and (iv) epileptiform activity. Each confounding factor is discussed thoroughly in the following:</p><sec sec-type="appendix" id="s11-1"><title>Fluctuations in static FC organization</title><p>Could the sparse and asynchronous nature of spatial convergence arise from the fact that fMRI and iEEG connectomes share a static FC organization that is expressed to <italic>varying degrees</italic> over time? Our above-detailed observations of shared discrete connectome states strongly speak against this scenario. Nevertheless, if the static scenario were true, the cross-modal similarity timecourse (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2B</xref>) should scale with the similarity to the static FC organization of either modality. To test this scenario, we first calculated the correlation between frame-by-frame connectome configurations in iEEG or fMRI to the static (i.e. time-averaged) connectome of that modality (i.e. static connectome ‘prominence’ <italic>timecourse</italic>). In each frequency band, we then extracted the temporal correlation between the cross-modal similarity timecourse and the fluctuating static connectome ‘prominence’ timecourse of fMRI or EEG (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7s1">Figure 7—figure supplement 1</xref>). This temporal correlation was consistently small in all comparisons (90 total cases of Subjects×Frequency bands×Modality) with the strongest positive association reaching a group-average maximum of <italic>r</italic>=0.07 ± 0.13 (<italic>r</italic>=0.14 ± 0.10 in 260 comparisons of source-localized EEG-fMRI dataset). When compared to a subject-specific chance level derived from phase-permuted cross-modal similarity timecourses (mean of 100 repetitions) no difference was observed in either dataset (for δ to γ bands, <italic>t</italic><sub>8</sub> at most 0.54 in intracranial EEG-fMRI, and <italic>t</italic><sub>25</sub> at most 1.28 for δ to γ bands in scalp EEG-fMRI). In other words, high spatial similarity across data modalities does not temporally align with moments of particularly strong expression of the static connectome organization. These findings suggest that instances of high spatial cross-modal similarity contain contributions from shared FC features beyond the static connectome. This finding is in line with the observation of distinct connectome states at significant CRP entries.</p></sec><sec sec-type="appendix" id="s11-2"><title>Limited FC strength</title><p>If the observed divergence of fMRI and iEEG FC reconfigurations were primarily driven by lack of sufficient SNR, then the strength of cross-modal FC similarity would likely depend on the strength of the signal, i.e., FC strength (for investigation of noise, see iii and iv.). In each frequency band, we assessed the temporal correlation between the frequency-specific cross-modal similarity timecourse and the frame-by-frame FC strength averaged (root mean square) overall connections of either fMRI or EEG (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7s1">Figure 7—figure supplement 1B</xref>). The group-average temporal correlations were consistently small over all comparisons (five frequencies for cross-modal similarity ×2 modalities for FC strength ×two datasets), such that the maximum group-average value among all comparisons was <italic>r</italic>=0.06 ± 0.12 in the intracranial EEG-fMRI dataset, and <italic>r</italic>=0.14 ± 0.07 in the scalp EEG-fMRI dataset. No significant association was observed when compared to the same phase-permutation null model as described in section i (for δ to γ bands, <italic>t</italic><sub>8</sub> at most 0.45 in intracranial EEG-fMRI, and <italic>t</italic><sub>25</sub> at most 1.90 in scalp EEG-fMRI). This observation speaks against a substantial contribution of low and fluctuating signal strength to the intermittent and sparse nature of the cross-modal similarity.</p></sec><sec sec-type="appendix" id="s11-3"><title>Head motion</title><p>To quantify the effects of head motion in each subject, we assessed the temporal correlation between the cross-modal similarity timecourse and the timecourse of framewise displacement (FD). Results are visualized in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7s1">Figure 7—figure supplement 1C</xref>. Again, the group-averaged temporal correlation was consistently small, reaching a group-average maximum of <italic>r</italic>=0.02 ± 0.07 and <italic>r</italic>=0.04 ± 0.07 in the intracranial and scalp EEG-fMRI datasets, respectively. There was no significant association when compared to the same phase-permutation null model as specified in section ‘i’ (across bands, <italic>t</italic><sub>8</sub> ≤ 0.21 in intracranial EEG-fMRI, and <italic>t</italic><sub>25</sub> ≤ 0.60 in scalp EEG-fMRI). This observation renders unlikely a substantial contribution of head motion to the intermittent and sparse nature of the cross-modal similarity.</p></sec><sec sec-type="appendix" id="s11-4"><title>Epileptiform activity</title><p>In the intracranial data, electrodes corresponding to epileptic regions were marked by clinicians and excluded from our analyses. However, additional interictal activity in the healthy brain regions and their corresponding changes in connectome configurations may be a source of artifact. The generalizability of our findings to the scalp EEG-fMRI dataset of healthy subject strongly suggests the independence of our findings from epileptiform activity. Despite that, we further quantified the impact of epileptiform activity in the intracranial EEG-fMRI data. Specifically, we extracted a binary timecourse of epileptiform activity via visual inspection of the iEEG data and quantified its temporal overlap (Jaccard index) with the binarized timecourse of cross-modal similarity (timepoints of significant and non-significant cross-modal similarity marked in a binary manner). The group-averaged Jaccard index was consistently small across all frequency bands, reaching a group-average maximum of 0.06±0.05 overlap. When compared to a null model generated by randomly shifting the binarized cross-modal similarity timecourse (100 repetitions), there was no significant positive association in any of the frequency bands (one-sided paired <italic>t</italic>-test across subject against the subject-specific mean of null samples: <italic>t</italic><sub>8</sub> &lt;0.42 for δ to γ bands). This observation implies that our findings are not primarily driven by epileptiform activity (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7s1">Figure 7—figure supplement 1D</xref>).</p></sec></sec><sec sec-type="appendix" id="s12"><title>Replication in sub-second window size</title><p>We replicated our major findings of CRP and its on-/off-diagonal ratio in the iEEG-fMRI dataset using a window length of 500 ms for FC calculations. Indeed, the data does not show a substantial difference in the on-/off-diagonal ratios of the CRP entries between the 3 s and 500 ms window lengths. Specifically, the ratio was equal to 1.02±0.07 for 500 ms window length, emphasizing absence of significant temporal convergence of the connectome dynamics (see <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s5">Figure 3—figure supplement 5</xref>). A paired t-test between group-averaged ratios across different lags confirms a lack of significant difference between the two analyses (p=0.50). This finding further emphasizes the genuine asynchronous nature of connectome dynamics across the neural timescales measured in fMRI and electrophysiology.</p></sec><sec sec-type="appendix" id="s13"><title>Validation of on-/off-diagonal ratio metric</title><p>We used simulated data to validate the theoretical basis of the on-/off-diagonal ratio metric and its ability to distinguish between Scenario I and Scenario II, as depicted in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1</xref>. Scenario III was excluded from these simulations since the absence of significant entries in the CRP under Scenario III makes the on-/off-diagonal ratio irrelevant for investigation.</p><p>We defined a random quantized signal with <italic>Ν</italic> levels to represent the recurrent manifestation of <italic>Ν</italic> fixed connectome states in one modality. When the second modality has an identical time course to the first modality, the resulting CRP (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s6">Figure 3—figure supplement 6</xref>, left subplot) shows more co-occurrences of the same states on the diagonal than off the diagonal (white entries). This aligns with expectations for Scenario I, where both spatial and temporal convergence are present. Conversely, when the state time course of the second modality is a shuffled version of the state time course of the first modality, the resulting CRP (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s6">Figure 3—figure supplement 6</xref>, right subplot) shows dispersed co-occurrences and diminished diagonal prominence. This outcome is in line with Scenario II, where spatial convergence exists, but temporal convergence is absent. These observed differences demonstrate how the CRP effectively captures the presence or absence of temporal alignment, successfully dissociating Scenarios I and II. We defined a random quantized signal with N levels to represent the recurrent manifestation of N fixed connectome states, in one modality. Pertaining to Scenario I, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s6">Figure 3—figure supplement 6</xref> (left subplot) shows the case where the second modality has the identical timecourse as the first modality. There are more co-occurrences of the same states on the diagonal than off the diagonal (white entries). This is in line with Scenario 1, where both spatial and temporal convergence are present. Pertaining to Scenario 2, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s6">Figure 3—figure supplement 6</xref> (right subplot) shows the case where state time course of the second modality is a shuffled version of the state time course of the first modality. As depicted, co-occurrences of the same states are more dispersed, and the diagonal prominence vanishes. The observed differences between the two cases illustrate how the CRP reflects the presence or absence of temporal alignment, dissociating scenarios 1 and 2.</p><p>To quantitatively validate this observation, we calculated the on-/off-diagonal ratio across simulations with varying N values. For Scenario 2 (shuffled version), the ratio consistently remained close to 1, indicating the absence of temporal synchronization. In contrast, Scenario 1 (non-shuffled version) produced significantly higher ratios, exceeding 1, confirming the metric’s ability to capture meaningful synchrony. These results demonstrate that the simulations successfully replicate the expected relationship between the two scenarios and the CRPs, and validate the theoretical foundation of the ratio metric under the defined assumptions.</p></sec></app></app-group></back><sub-article article-type="editor-report" id="sa0"><front-stub><article-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.98777.4.sa0</article-id><title-group><article-title>eLife Assessment</article-title></title-group><contrib-group><contrib contrib-type="author"><name><surname>Fornito</surname><given-names>Alex</given-names></name><role specific-use="editor">Reviewing Editor</role><aff><institution>Monash University</institution><country>Australia</country></aff></contrib></contrib-group><kwd-group kwd-group-type="evidence-strength"><kwd>Convincing</kwd></kwd-group><kwd-group kwd-group-type="claim-importance"><kwd>Important</kwd></kwd-group></front-stub><body><p>This <bold>important</bold> work uses an innovative approach to understand similarities between haemodynamic and electrophysiological activity of the human brain, and how the brain might carry out multiple functions concurrently across different brain regions by using multiple timescales.

Temporally convergent, same trajectories through connectome state space</p><p>- Scenario2. Temporally divergent, different trajectories through connectome state space</p><p>However, based on my understanding (and apologies if I am mistaken), I am concerned that these scenarios do not necessarily translate into the schematic CRP plots shown in fig 2C, or the statements in the main text, i.e.:</p><p>- For scenario1, &quot;epochs of cross-modal spatial similarity should occur more frequently at on-diagonal (synchronous) than off-diagonal (asynchronous) entries, resulting in an on-/off-diagonal ratio larger than unity&quot;</p><p>- For scenario2, &quot;epochs of spatial similarity could occur equally likely at on-diagonal and off-diagonal entries (ratio≈1)&quot;</p><p>Where do the authors get these statements and the schematics in fig2C from? They do not seem to be fully justified via previous literature, theory, or simulations?</p><p>In particular, I am not convinced based on the evidence currently in the paper, that the ratio of off- to on-diagonal entries (and under what assumptions) is a definitive way to discriminate between scenarios 1 and 2.</p><p>For example, what about the case where the same network configuration reoccurs in both modalities at multiple time points. It seems to me that you would get a CRP with entries occurring equally on the on-diagonal as on the off-diagonal, regardless of whether the dynamics are matched between the two modalities or not (i.e. regardless of scenario 1 or 2 being true).</p><p>This thought experiment example might have a flaw in it, and the authors might ultimately be correct, but nonetheless a systematic justification needs to be provided for using the ratio of off- to on-diagonal entries to discriminate between scenario 1 and 2 (and under what assumptions it is valid).</p></disp-quote><p>Thank you for raising this important point. In response, we have now included simulation results to complement our earlier authors’ response, which provided literature references and a theoretical explanation of the on-/off-diagonal ratio metric.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>In the absence of theory, the authors could use surrogate data for scenario 1 and 2. For example:</p><p>a. For scenario 1, run the CRP using a single modality. E.g. feed in the EEG into the analysis as both modality 1 AND modality 2. This should provide at least one example of CRP under scenario 1 (although it does not ensure that all CRPs under this scenario will look like this, it is at least a useful sanity check).</p></disp-quote><p>Note: This simulation was included in the previous round of author’s responses.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>b. For scenario 2, run the CRP using a single modality plus a shuffled version. E.g. feed in the EEG into the analysis as both modality 1 AND a temporally shuffled version of the EEG as modality 2. The temporal shuffling of the EEG could be done by simple splitting the data into blocks of say ~10s and then shuffling them into a new order. This should provide a version of the CRP under scenario 2 (although it does not ensure that all CRPs under this scenario will look like this, it is at least a useful sanity check)</p><p>The authors have provided CRP plots for option a. It shows a CRP, as expected, consistent with scenario 1. This is a useful sanity check. However, as mentioned above, it does not ensure that all CRPs under this scenario will look like this.</p><p>However, the authors have not shown a CRP as per option b. As such, there is an incomplete justification for the expected outcomes of the scenarios.</p><p>Note that another option, which has not been carried out, is to use full simulations, with clearly specified assumptions, for scenario1 and 2. One way of doing this is to use a simplified (state-space) setup where you randomly simulate N spatially fixed networks that are independently switching on and off over time (i.e. &quot;activation&quot; is 0 or 1). Note that this would result in a N-dimensional connectome state space.</p><p>Using this, you can simulate and compute the CRPs for the two scenarios:</p><p>a. Scenario 1: where the simulated activation timecourses are set to be the same between both modalities</p><p>b. Scenario 2: where the simulated activation timecourses are simulated separately for each of the modalities</p></disp-quote><p>We followed the reviewer’s suggestion and have now included full simulations to address the concerns regarding the theory of the on-/off-diagonal ratio metric. As recommended, we defined a random quantized signal with N levels to represent the recurrent manifestation of N fixed connectome states. This setup was used to demonstrate the relationship between the two scenarios and the CRP observations used to adjudicate between the scenarios in our paper.</p><p>The CRP matrices in Fig. S10 provide an example illustration of this simulation. In the case where the two state timeseries are identical, there are more co-occurrences of the same state (white entries) on the diagonal than off the diagonal (left subplot). This is in line with Scenario 1, where both spatial and temporal convergence are present. Conversely, in Scenario 2, where state time courses are shuffled, co-occurrences of the same states are more dispersed, and the diagonal prominence vanishes (right subplot).

The paper states: &quot;To mitigate this issue, we provide results from source-localized data both with and without leakage correction (supplementary and main text, respectively).&quot; It is great that the authors provide both. However, given that FC in EEG is almost totally dominated by spatial leakage (see Hipp paper), the main results/figures for the scalp EEG should be done using spatial leakage corrected EEG data.</p></disp-quote><p>Thank you. We agree that source leakage is an important consideration, which is why the current work investigated the intracranial EEG-fMRI data as a primary approach and subsequently added the scalp EEG-fMRI approach. While source leakage correction is essential for addressing spurious connectivity, it can also risk removing genuine functional connectivity that includes zero-lag relationships. We are reassured by the observation that the scalp data both without and with leakage correction confirmed the findings of the intracranial data, i.e., the presence of spatial and a lack of temporal cross-modal convergence. As such we do not believe that source leakage had a considerable impact on the specific question at hand.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p><bold>Reviewer #2 (Public review):</bold></p><p>Summary:</p><p>The study investigates the brain's functional connectivity (FC) dynamics across different timescales using simultaneous recordings of intracranial EEG/source-localized EEG and fMRI.
