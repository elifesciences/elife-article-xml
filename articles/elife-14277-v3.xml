Here, we identify cooperative non-cell-autonomous functions of a single gene that together provide a novel mechanism of tumor suppression in basal keratinocytes of zebrafish embryos. A loss-of-function mutation in <italic>atp1b1a</italic>, encoding the beta subunit of a Na,K-ATPase pump, causes edema and epidermal malignancy. Strikingly, basal cell carcinogenesis only occurs when Atp1b1a function is compromised in both the overlying periderm (resulting in compromised epithelial polarity and adhesiveness) and in kidney and heart (resulting in hypotonic stress). Blockade of the ensuing PI3K-AKT-mTORC1-NFκB-MMP9 pathway activation in basal cells, as well as systemic isotonicity, prevents malignant transformation. Our results identify hypotonic stress as a (previously unrecognized) contributor to tumor development and establish a novel paradigm of tumor suppression.</p><p><bold>DOI:</bold> <ext-link ext-link-type="doi" xlink:href="10.7554/eLife.14277.001">http://dx.doi.org/10.7554/eLife.14277.001</ext-link></p></abstract><abstract abstract-type="executive-summary"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.14277.002</object-id><title>eLife digest</title><p>Cancer can develop when cells in the body gain mutations that allow them to grow and divide rapidly. Some of these mutations may affect the activity of genes that usually act to prevent cancer from developing. Several such “tumor suppressor” genes have been identified, but it is likely that many remain undiscovered and it is far from fully understoodhow all these genes work. One way to identify new tumor suppressor genes is to examine tumors to search for genes that have gained mutations that block their activity, known as loss-of-function mutations.</p><p>Hatzold et al. identified a new and rather unexpected tumor suppressor gene by studying a zebrafish mutant that develops skin cancer as the embryo grows. The experiments showed that cells in the skin of the developing embryos of this mutant grow excessively and start to invade deeper tissues in the body. This behavior is caused by loss-of-function mutations in a gene called <italic>atp1b1a</italic>. This gene encodes part of an ion pump protein that helps to control the amount of water and ions in cells and in body fluids.</p><p>Further experiments showed that this tumor suppressor gene does not act in the skin cells themselves but in other cells of organs such as the kidney. The kidney is involved in controlling the water and ion content of the body (known as osmoregulation), and the <italic>atp1b1a</italic> mutants have lower levels of ions and increased levels of water than normal zebrafish. Cancer formation could be completely blocked when the mutant embryos were kept in a solution that had the same salt and water content as the animals, instead of regular fresh water. This suggests that exposure of cells to body fluids with decreased ion and increased salt contents, a condition also called hypotonic stress, increases the risk of developing some tumors.</p><p>Osmoregulatory organs that are not working efficiently, or injuries that expose cells to different ion and water levels can both cause hypotonic stress. The next steps are to investigate whether this stress also promotes cancer formation in mammals, including humans.</p><p><bold>DOI:</bold> <ext-link ext-link-type="doi" xlink:href="10.7554/eLife.14277.002">http://dx.doi.org/10.7554/eLife.14277.002</ext-link></p></abstract><kwd-group kwd-group-type="author-keywords"><title>Author Keywords</title><kwd>basal cell carcinogenesis</kwd><kwd>Na/K-ATPase</kwd><kwd>epithelial polarity</kwd></kwd-group><kwd-group kwd-group-type="research-organism"><title>Research Organism</title><kwd>Zebrafish</kwd></kwd-group><funding-group><award-group id="par-1"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100001659</institution-id><institution>Deutsche Forschungsgemeinschaft</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>SFB 829</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Hammerschmidt</surname><given-names>Matthias</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="par-2"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000057</institution-id><institution>National Institute of General Medical Sciences</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>GM63904</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Hammerschmidt</surname><given-names>Matthias</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="par-3"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100000780</institution-id><institution>European Commission</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>HEALTH-F4-2010-242048</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Hammerschmidt</surname><given-names>Matthias</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><funding-statement>The funders had no role in study design, data collection and interpretation, or the decision to submit the work for publication.</funding-statement></funding-group><custom-meta-group><custom-meta><meta-name>elife-xml-version</meta-name><meta-value>2.5</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta specific-use="meta-only"><meta-name>Author impact statement</meta-name><meta-value>A Na,K-ATPase beta subunit can suppress basal cell carcinogenesis either via its osmoregulatory function to avoid hypotonic stress, or by promoting epithelial polarity and adhesiveness of basal keratinocytes from the overlying outer layer.</meta-value></custom-meta></custom-meta-group></article-meta></front><body><sec id="s1" sec-type="intro"><title>Introduction</title><p>Many malignancies result from loss-of-function mutations in one or more tumor suppressor genes whose normal function is concerned with the inhibition of cell division, the induction of apoptosis and/or the inhibition of metastasis. Most tumor suppressors affect one or more of these processes in a cell-autonomous manner, being produced by and acting within the tumor precursor cells themselves (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib58">Sherr, 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib64">Sun and Yang, 2010</xref>), whereas comparably few genes are known to block tumorigenesis in a non-cell-autonomous manner (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Chua et al., 2014</xref>). Tumor suppressors often act by inhibiting or antagonizing proto-oncogenic factors. The phosphatase PTEN for instance is the antagonist of phosphatidyl-inositol-3-kinases (PI3Ks), critical coordinators of intracellular signaling in response to extracellular stimuli such as growth factors and cytokines. Hyperactivity of PI3K signaling cascades, including that involving AKT/PKB (protein kinase B), is one of the most common events in human cancers (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Altomare and Testa, 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib67">Thorpe et al., 2015</xref>).</p><p>One of the transcription factors regulated by PI3K/AKT via the mTORC1 complex is NFκB (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Dan et al., 2008</xref>). Increased NFκB activity is observed in many carcinomas (solid malignancies derived from epithelial cells), promoting cell survival, proliferation and metastasis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">Karin et al., 2002</xref>). However, the actual genetic cause of NFκB activation is unknown in most of these cases (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Ben-Neriah and Karin, 2011</xref>). Furthermore, in other instances, anti-tumorigenic effects of NFκB have been described (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Ben-Neriah and Karin, 2011</xref>).</p><p>In epithelial cells, carcinogenesis can also be caused by compromised functioning of genes involved in the formation and maintenance of epithelial cell polarity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib49">Martin-Belmonte and Perez-Moreno, 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Ellenbroek et al., 2012</xref>). Prominent examples of affected proteins include CRB3, a member of the Crumbs complex; PAR3, a member of the partitioning defective (PAR) / aPKC complex, which like the Crumbs complex promotes apical identities; and LGL1 (Lethal giant larvae-1), DLG (Discs large) and SCRIB, members of the Scribble complex, which promote basolateral identities. In <italic>Drosophila</italic>, a second pro-basolateral complex has been described, consisting of a Na,K-ATPase, Coracle, Yurt and Neurexin IV, which acts in partial functional redundancy with the Scribble complex (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib51">Paul et al., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib43">Laprise et al., 2009</xref>).</p><p>Na,K-ATPases are ion pumps composed of a catalytic α-subunit and a regulatory β-subunit that is required for proper trafficking, localization, and functionality of the α-subunit (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Geering, 2008</xref>). Four α-subunit and three β-subunit genes have been described in mammals, of which α1 and β1 are the major isoforms in epithelial cells. These subunits transport Na and K ions across the cell membrane, and thereby play well-characterized roles in generating electrochemical gradients in multiple cell types, and in sodium and water balancing in renal tubules, thereby regulating body fluid composition and volume. However, additional pump-independent and evolutionary conserved functions for Na,K-ATPase proteins have been described in the context of epithelial cell adhesiveness and polarity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib68">Vagin et al., 2012</xref>). Here, the β-subunits play a prominent role. These are type II transmembrane proteins with glycosylated extracellular domains that can form β1-β1 trans-bonds between neighboring cells, thereby promoting both epithelial polarity and intercellular adhesiveness of cultured cells. β-subunit glycosylation has a positive impact on cell-cell adhesiveness, most likely by stabilizing E-cadherin cell adhesion proteins (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib69">Vagin et al., 2008</xref>). Consistently, in transformed Madin-Darby canine kidney epithelial cells (MDCK) cells, the expression of both E-cadherin and the Na,K-ATPase β1-subunit is drastically reduced, and epithelial polarity and junctional complexes can only be re-established upon repletion of both molecules (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib53">Rajasekaran et al., 2001</xref>). Na,K-ATPase β<sub>1</sub>-subunit levels are also reduced in cell lines derived from various carcinomas. This evidence, together with functional studies with transformed MDCK cells, has led to the proposal that the Na,K-ATPase β<sub>1</sub> subunit has a potential tumor-suppressor function (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Inge et al., 2008</xref>), but direct genetic evidence for this notion had been missing to date.</p><p>Here, we report that a loss-of-function mutation in the β-subunit Atp1b1a causes epidermal malignancy in zebrafish <italic>psoriasis</italic> mutant embryos (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib71">Webb et al., 2008</xref>), correlated with reduced E-cadherin levels and a genetic interaction with the formerly described epithelial polarity regulator and tumor suppressor Lgl2 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib60">Sonawane et al., 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib54">Reischauer et al., 2009</xref>). During the affected stages, the epidermis is normally bi-layered, consisting of a tight junction-bearing outer periderm and a basal layer of keratinocytes. The latter are transformed in <italic>atp1b1a</italic> mutants, leading to their overgrowth and invasion of dermal compartments. Keratinocyte transformation is transduced via aberrant activation of a PI3K-AKT-mTORC1-NFκB-MMP9 (metalloprotease 9) pathway. Chemical inhibition of PI3K, mTORC1 and NFκB rescues all aspects of malignancy, whereas knockdown of MMP9 alleviates only epidermal invasiveness but not hyperplasia, pointing to a specific role of this matrix metalloprotease as one of the mediators of metastasis, and to the involvement of additional relevant NFκB targets. Epidermal malignancy is also fully suppressed upon incubation of embryos in isotonic (rather than the natural hypotonic) medium, and the remaining basal cell polarity and adhesiveness defects can be rescued by concomitant re-introduction of wild-type Atp1b1a in peridermal cells. Together with other presented data, these findings indicate that epidermal malignancy results from a combined loss of the β-subunit’s trans-layer function in promoting basal cell polarity via the periderm, and its osmoregulatory function in suppressing hypotonic stress. Possible tumor-promoting effects of hypotonicity during human carcinogenesis are discussed.</p></sec><sec id="s2" sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><sec id="s2-1"><title><italic>psoriasis</italic> mutant embryos display characteristics of epidermal malignancy</title><p>The zebrafish <italic>psoriasis</italic> mutant was isolated in a phenotype-based screen after undirected ethyl methanesulfonate (EMS)-mutagenesis and has been described as developing edema as well as epidermal aggregates during embryogenesis (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1a,b</xref>) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib71">Webb et al., 2008</xref>).

To test this, we incubated wild-type embryos in 3 mM ouabain, an inhibitor of the pumping function of the α-subunit. Treated embryos displayed numerous formerly reported phenotypes (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5s1">Figure 5—figure supplement 1</xref>; and data not shown), typical of those caused by genetic mutations in other Na,K-ATPases (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Blasiole et al., 2006</xref>), as well as pericardial edema (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5l–n</xref>).

This points to an additional, pump-independent function of Atp1b1a, which makes keratinocytes more resistant to hypotonic stress.</p></sec><sec id="s2-5"><title>Atp1b1a is required for proper epithelial organization of epidermal cells independently of hypotonic conditions</title><p>Several functions additional to their role in ion homeostasis have been described for Na,K-ATPases, such as a role in epithelial polarity that promotes basolateral membrane identities, as well as a role in intercellular adhesion (see Introduction). To study the subcellular localization of zebrafish Atp1b1a, we transiently expressed an <italic>atp1b1a-gfp</italic> fusion construct in peridermal cells, one of its endogenous expression sites (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3i</xref>), under the control of the <italic>krt4</italic> promoter. As described for Na,K-ATPases in other epithelial cells, Atp1b1a-GFP was localized in the basolateral domain of peridermal cells, together with E-cadherin (Cdh1), while it was absent from the apical region marked by the tight junction protein Tjp1/ZO-1 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib40">Kiener and Hunziker, 2007</xref>) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6a</xref>). Consistent basolateral defects were found in <italic>psoriasis</italic> mutants even when incubated in isotonic medium to exclude effects resulting from tonicity-related stress.

By contrast, the lateral regions of peridermal cells were less organized (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6d,e</xref>), and aberrant gaps were observed between peridermal cells and underlying basal keratinocytes (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6b–f</xref>), Furthermore, the membranous localization of Cdh1 and Lgl2 proteins was strongly diminished in both the peridermal and basal cells of <italic>psoriasis</italic> mutants, independent of whether they had been incubated in hypotonic or isotonic medium (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7a–h</xref>).

This suggests that Atp1b1a might regulate epithelial polarity and epidermal integrity at least in part by cooperating with Lgl2 and by ensuring its proper localization. To test whether, in line with this notion, <italic>lgl2</italic> and <italic>atp1b1a</italic> genetically interact, we performed synergistic enhancement studies. When either <italic>lgl2</italic> or <italic>atp1b1a</italic> MOs were injected at a low, sub-phenotypic concentration, all embryos displayed wild-type morphology. By contrast, when the two MOs were co-injected at the same concentrations, 62% of the embryos (n = 74) developed pericardial edema, a loss of Na/K-ATPase α-subunits from the basolateral domains of pronephric epithelial cells, epidermal aggregates, and an upregulation of the malignancy markers pAKT and <italic>mmp9</italic> in basal keratinocytes, similar to the phenotype after full knockdown of <italic>atp1b1a</italic> (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7m–q</xref>; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7s1">Figure 7—figure supplement 1</xref>). This indicates that <italic>lgl2</italic> and <italic>atp1b1a</italic> cooperate to promote proper epithelial cell polarity and integrity in the epidermis as well as proper osmoregulation in the kidney, thereby suppressing epidermal malignancy.</p><p>In contrast to <italic>lgl2</italic> expression (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib60">Sonawane et al., 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib61">Sonawane et al., 2009</xref>), <italic>atp1b1a</italic> expression in the epidermis is restricted to the periderm, suggesting that the effect of this gene on basal keratinocytes must be indirect. To prove this more directly, and to rule out indirect effects caused by hypotonicity, we analyzed chimeric embryos under isotonic conditions. Wild-type basal cell precursors that were transplanted into <italic>atp1b1a</italic> morphant hosts later exhibited distorted keratin distribution similar to that of their morphant neighbors (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8">Figure 8a</xref>). Vice versa, <italic>atp1b1a</italic> morphant basal cells transplanted into wild-type hosts were indistinguishable from their wild-type neighbors and displayed normal keratin distribution (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8">Figure 8b</xref>). This indicates that keratin localization in basal keratinocytes and the epithelial polarity of these cells are under the control of Atp1b1a function in a tissue other than the basal epidermal layer and the osmoregulatory organs. To show that this tissue is the periderm, we established a stable line of the aforementioned <italic>krt4</italic> transgene driving expression of <italic>atp1b1a-gfp</italic> exclusively in peridermal cells. In <italic>psoriasis</italic> mutants carrying this transgene that were raised under isotonic conditions, keratin localization in basal keratinocytes was fully restored and indistinguishable from that in wild-type siblings (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8">Figure 8c–e</xref>; n = 28/28; 3 independent experiments). We conclude that <italic>atp1b1a</italic> is required in the periderm to establish proper epithelial polarity and organization in the underlying basal keratinocytes. Furthermore, this function is independent of the osmoregulatory role of Atp1b1a, as the corresponding defects are present even in mutants kept in isotonic medium, thus in the absence of hypotonic stress. When kept in hypotonic medium, <italic>psoriasis</italic> mutants carrying the <italic>krt4:atp1b1a-gfp</italic> transgene displayed a partial restoration of epidermal cell polarity both in the periderm and in the basal layer (cytokeratin and Lgl2 localization; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8s1">Figure 8—figure supplement 1e,I,m and f,j,n</xref>) and a partial, but significant amelioration of basal cell malignancy (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8s1">Figure 8—figure supplement 1a–c</xref>), including reduction in the expression of the malignancy markers pAKT and <italic>mmp9</italic> (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8">Figure 8f–h</xref>; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8s1">Figure 8—figure supplement 1g,k,o</xref>). The failure of full restoration under hypotonic conditions suggests that hypotonic stress further challenges the epidermal polarity system, which becomes more difficult to repair than is the case under isotonic conditions. In addition, the data reveal that upon hypotonic stress, the degrees of epidermal polarity defects and epidermal malignancy are proportionally linked.<fig-group><fig id="fig8" position="float"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.14277.024</object-id><label>Figure 8.</label><caption><title><italic>atp1b1a</italic> is required in peridermal cells to establish epithelial organization of basal keratinocytes, and to suppress hypotonicity-induced upregulation of pAKT levels in basal keratinocytes.</title><p>(<bold>a</bold>–<bold>b</bold>) IF of cytokeratins (Ker; red) and GFP (green) in 84 hpf chimeric embryos raised in isotonic conditions.

Together with the reduction in the blood pressure, these defects should lead to compromised water elimination in the pronephros, as reflected by the reduced clearance of rhodamin-dextran from the blood (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4</xref>). The resulting increase in water content in turn causes edema formation and a corresponding reduction in the osmolarity of interstitial compartments (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Drummond et al., 1998</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Hentschel et al., 2005</xref>).</p></sec><sec id="s3-2"><title>The role of Atp1b1a during epithelial polarity and cell-cell adhesion in the epidermis, and its trans-effect from the periderm to the basal layer</title><p>In addition, and independently of its osmoregulatory functions, Atp1b1a is required in the periderm to assure proper epithelial polarity and cell-cell adhesiveness, both in the periderm and in the underlying basal keratinocytes. Thus, even when the osmoregulatory role of Atp1b1a has become dispensable upon incubation in isotonic medium, peridermal cells of mutant embryos display reduced levels of E-cadherin and of Lgl2, a pro-basal polarity regulator, as well as increased spacing between epidermal cells. Strikingly, basal keratinocytes themselves also display specific defects, such as reduced membraneous Lgl2 and E-cadherin levels, as well as a mislocalization of cytokeratins in basal domains. These defects could be rescued when transgene-encoded wild-type Atp1b1a was re-introduced into peridermal cells, indicating that Atp1b1a from the periderm regulates the epithelial organization and adhesiveness of basal keratinocytes in a tonicity-independent manner (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8">Figure 8</xref>).</p><p>But what are the molecular mechanisms that underlie this trans-layer effect? Trans-bonds between ATPase β-subunits, previously reported to mediate cell-cell adhesiveness in other instances (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib68">Vagin et al., 2012</xref>), could account for the adhesiveness among peridermal cells, but not for that between peridermal and basal cells, as the latter lack <italic>atp1b1a</italic> expression. The cell-cell adhesion molecule E-cadherin might be the relevant mediator. In <italic>psoriasis</italic> mutants, E-cadherin membrane localization is severely diminished both in peridermal and in basal cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7</xref>). The reduction of E-cadherin in peridermal cells could be a direct consequence of the loss of Atp1b1a, with which it is normally co-localized in basolateral regions (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6</xref>). This is consistent with the formerly reported physical interaction between ATPase α-subunits and E-cadherin via the anchoring protein ankyrin and the spectrin-actin cytoskeleton (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib68">Vagin et al., 2012</xref>). In addition, Atp1b1a could promote E-cadherin localization via other epithelial polarity regulators, consistent with reports in MCDK cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib52">Qin et al., 2005</xref>). We propose that it is this loss of proper E-cadherin in peridermal cells that compromises not only their adhesion to the underlying basal cells (due to the loss of trans-bonds between the basal side of peridermal and the apical side of basal cells; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1</xref>) but also the adhesion among basal cells themselves, as well as their epithelial polarity. Consistent with the latter notion, loss of E-cadherin has been shown to affect apical-basal polarity in numerous systems (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Desai et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib63">Stephenson et al., 2010</xref>).</p></sec><sec id="s3-3"><title>Atp1b1a as a multi-functional non-cell autonomous tumor suppressor</title><p>E-cadherin and epithelial polarity regulators, including Lgl2, are well-known tumor suppressors (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Birchmeier, 1995</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib49">Martin-Belmonte and Perez-Moreno, 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Ellenbroek et al., 2012</xref>). Atp1b1a is another cell adhesion molecule and epithelial polarity regulator to add to the list,, as its loss causes crucial features of carcinogenesis (hyperplasia and infiltration of other tissues) in vivo. Strikingly, however, epidermal malignancy only occurs upon the combined loss of Atp1b1a’s osmoregulatory and epithelial polarity-regulating functions. Thus, hypotonic stress per se does not lead to basal cell malignancy, as demonstrated in this work by the treatment of wild-type embryos with ouabain. Consistently, none of the described kidney mutants, although displaying massive edema formation as a result of internal hypotonicity, have had reported skin defects (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Drummond et al., 1998</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Drummond, 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Hentschel et al., 2005</xref>). Moreover, epidermal malignancy in <italic>atp1b1a</italic> mutants is suppressed in the absence of hypotonic stress, although epithelial polarity and adhesiveness in the embryonic skin remain compromised.</p><p>Carcinogenesis is commonly regarded as a multistep process, to which aberrant polarity signaling can contribute as one of multiple causative factors (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib58">Sherr, 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib64">Sun and Yang, 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Ellenbroek et al., 2012</xref>). In this light, carcinogenesis subsequent to the combined loss of different functions of one and the same factor is an astonishing and thus far unrecognized variation of this common concept. In addition, it is remarkable that one of these genetically caused effects (hypotonicity) can also be achieved by environmental insults (injury), constituting an interesting variation of the common concept of tumorigenesis as a result of combined genetic and environmental factors.</p></sec><sec id="s3-4"><title>The cooperation between Atp1b1a and Lgl2</title><p>Another epithelial polarity regulator that has a tumor-suppressing function in the epidermis of zebrafish embryos is Lgl2. Like <italic>atp1b1a</italic> mutants, <italic>lgl2</italic> mutants display aberrant apical-basal polarity of basal keratinocytes (mislocalized cytokeratin) and E-cadherin displacement, as well as epidermal hyperplasia and increased expression of <italic>mmp9</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib60">Sonawane et al., 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib54">Reischauer et al., 2009</xref>), which we now can interpret as a sign of invasiveness. Although not yet addressed, carcinogenesis in <italic>lgl2</italic> mutants might also involve hypotonic stress, and <italic>lgl2</italic>, like <italic>atp1b1a</italic>, might act both in the epidermis and in the kidney. Thus, we found that <italic>atp1b1a</italic> and <italic>lgl2</italic> not only genetically interact during epidermal cell polarity and malignancy but also during edema formation and Na/K-ATPase α-subunit localization (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7s1">Figure 7—figure supplement 1</xref>), in line with previous reports of pronephric defects and mild edema formation in <italic>lgl2</italic> morphants (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib65">Tay et al., 2013</xref>). However, <italic>atp1b1a</italic> and <italic>lgl2</italic> mutants also display differences. Although in conjunction with other mutations, loss of Lgl2 function leads to defects in earlier developmental stages (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib72">Westcot et al., 2015</xref>; this work), epidermal hyperplasia in <italic>lgl2</italic> single mutants begins significantly later (4 days post fertilization; dpf) than that in <italic>atp1b1a</italic> mutants (2 dpf). An even more pronounced requirement in different time windows has been reported for Na,K-ATPase and Lgl during epithelial polarity regulation in <italic>Drosophila</italic> embryos. Thus, defects in <italic>lgl</italic> mutants are manifested during gastrulation, when ATPase is dispensable, whereas corresponding defects in ATPase mutants are first detected during early organogenesis stages, when the defects in <italic>lgl</italic> mutants begin to recover (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib43">Laprise et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib44">Laprise and Tepass, 2011</xref>). This suggests that as in flies, Atp1b1a and Lgl2 in zebrafish might act in different basolateral-promoting complexes, which have differential temporal but partially redundant functions. In addition, although eventually converging at similar or even identical (<italic>mmp9</italic>) effector genes, Atp1b1a and Lgl2 can fulfill their tumor-suppressing role by blocking different pathways. Lgl2 has been reported to act by blocking ErbB and MAPK in later epidermal malignancies (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib54">Reischauer et al., 2009</xref>), but earlier it cooperates with Atp1b1a to inhibit aberrant activation of a PI3K-AKT-mTORC1-NFκB pathway (this work).</p></sec><sec id="s3-5"><title>The PI3K-AKT-mTORC1-NFκB pathway as an integrator of hypotonic stress and aberrant epithelial cell polarity</title><p>Of note, chemical inhibition of the PI3K-AKT-mTORC1-NFκB pathway in <italic>atp1b1a</italic> mutants blocks epidermal malignancy, but it does not rescue the edema or epithelial polarity phenotype. This indicates that the pathway acts downstream of, and integrates, these two primary effects caused by the loss of Atp1b1a, which per se are necessary but not sufficient for pathway activation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig10">Figure 10m</xref>).</p><p>Parts of the PI3K-AKT-mTORC1-NFκB pathway had previously been reported to mediate hypotonic stress or tumorigenesis in other contexts.

Furthermore, PI3K, AKT and NFκB mediate the tumorigenic effects of different cytokines in cultured prostate, gastric and leukemic cancer cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Dilly et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">Kang et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib73">Wang et al., 2011</xref>), while mTORC1 controls NFκB activity downstream of pAKT in prostate and breast cancer cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Dan et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Davis et al., 2014</xref>).</p><p>The effects of the transcription factor NFκB in the context of tumorigenesis are complex, and multiple mechanisms and effectors have been described. NFκB can affect cancer cell survival, proliferation and invasiveness, and can act in cancer cells themselves or on the tumor microenvironment, for instance by regulating tissue inflammation, which in turn further stimulates tumor progression (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Ben-Neriah and Karin, 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">Hoesel and Schmid, 2013</xref>). In <italic>atp1b1a</italic> mutants, however, inflammation seems to be of minor relevance: epidermal aggregates only display moderately increased numbers of innate immune cells, and genetic ablation of the entire myeloid lineage does not alleviate epidermal malignancy (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s2">Figure 2—figure supplement 2</xref>). One prominent direct transcriptional target of NFκB is <italic>mmp9</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib55">Rhee et al., 2007</xref>), a matrix-metalloprotease with collagenase activity that destabilizes basement membranes and connective tissue, thereby facilitating tumor progression and metastasis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">Kessenbrock and Werb, 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">Kang et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Dilly et al., 2013</xref>). In addition, MMPs can promote tumor vascularization and inflammation as well as tumor cell proliferation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">Kessenbrock and Werb, 2010</xref>). In zebrafish <italic>atp1b1a</italic> mutants, however, the NFκB-dependent increase in <italic>mmp9</italic> expression only contributes to epidermal invasiveness, while epidermal hyperplasia is mediated by NFκB targets other than <italic>mmp9</italic> (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig10">Figure 10m</xref>). Thus, in contrast to <italic>mmp9</italic> knockdown, treatment of mutant embryos with hydroxyurea rescues epidermal hyperproliferation in the persistent presence of high NFκB activity. The nature of these proliferation-promoting NFκB targets remains unknown. CyclinD1 (<italic>ccnd1</italic>), a described direct transcriptional NFκB target in mammals(<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Hinz et al., 1999</xref>), seems an unlikely target, as its expression levels are unaltered in <italic>atp1b1a</italic> mutants (JH and MH, unpublished data).</p><p>What also remains unknown is the player upstream of PI3K that is directly affected by hypotonicity and by the compromised epithelial polarity / adhesiveness of basal keratinocytes (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig10">Figure 10m</xref>). EGFR would be a strong candidate. It acts as the upstream regulator of PI3K to mediate hypotonic stress in human keratinocytes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib41">Kippenberger et al., 2005</xref>), and is activated by hypotonicity in several other, MAPK-mediated responses (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib46">Lezama et al., 2005</xref>). Like Atp1b1a, EGFR is normally targeted to the basolateral side of epithelial cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">He et al., 2002</xref>), and its signaling strength is under the control of the epithelial polarity system (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Hobert et al., 1999</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib70">Vermeer et al., 2003</xref>). Nevertheless, treatment of <italic>atp1b1a</italic> mutant embryos with the chemical pan-ErbB inhibitor PD168393 failed to rescue epidermal malignancies (JH and MH, unpublished data). This suggests that other receptor tyrosine kinases or their modifiers are the relevant players at the convergence point of hypotonic stress and aberrant epithelial polarity signaling.</p></sec><sec id="s3-6"><title>Na,K-ATPases and hypotonicity during human carcinogenesis</title><p>Na,K-ATPases and hypotonicity might also play a role during human carcinogenesis.

This notion was based on functional analyses performed with virus-transformed MDCK cells, and the down-regulation of the β1-subunit in different human carcinoma cell lines (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Espineda et al., 2004</xref>), and is strongly supported by our genetic in vivo data presented here.</p><p>There are also several indirect lines of evidence for a tumor-promoting effect of hypotonic stress during human carcinogenesis. For instance, untransformed human keratinocytes display strongly increased proliferation when cultured in hypotonic medium (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Gönczi et al., 2007</xref>). Systemic hypotonicity can also occur in humans in vivo. A major human condition that leads to systemic hypotonicity in conjunction with reduced Na levels (hypotonic or hypoosmolar hyponatremia) is increased nephric water re-absorption caused by ADH (antidiuretic hormone) hyperactivity. In SIADH (Syndrome of inappropriate antidiuretic hormone secretion), this is usually linked to carcinogenesis and results from ectopic ADH production by the tumors, which in general are rather aggressive (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Ellison and Berl, 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Grohé and Berardi, 2015</xref>). In fact, hyponatremia is quite common in malignant solid tumors beyond SIADH (up to 25% of all patients). It is used as a prognostic and predictive value and is associated with high morbidity rates; its early diagnosis and treatment significantly improves the patients’ prognosis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib57">Schutz et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Grohé and Berardi, 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Balachandran et al., 2015</xref>). This correlation suggests that systemic hypotonicity / hyponatremia increases carcinoma incidence and aggressiveness. In addition, the carcinogenesis risk seems to be increased by locally restricted hypotonic stress. Such stress might occur, for instance, during injuries of the lung or the esophagus (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib56">Ribeiro et al., 1996</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">Islami et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Goldkorn and Filosto, 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib48">Maret-Ouda et al., 2016</xref>), when epithelial cells become exposed to the airway surface fluid (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">Joris and Quinton, 1993</xref>) or to saliva (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Edgar, 1992</xref>), respectively, both of which are hypotonic compared to the internal milieu.

No outliers were encountered. Mean values and standard deviations of all individual specimens (biological samples; n) from one representative or all independent experiments are presented, as specified in the respective figure legends. Numbers of biological samples analyzed were decided on depending on obtained standard deviations and statistical significances. Quantifications of phenotypes were conducted by comparing treated and control progeny of the same parental fish. Fluorescence intensities were determined using ImageJ software. Significance of differences was determined using an unpaired two-tailed Student’s t-test, and obtained p values are mentioned in the respective figure legends. Numerical data from all quantitative analyses are also provided in the Supplement as a source data file. Data illustrated in representative images that are shown without statistical calculations were obtained from at least 15 out of 15 investigated specimens from at least three independent experiments.</p></sec></sec></body><back><ack id="ack"><title>Acknowledgements</title><p>We thank Heike Wessendorf for excellent technical assistance; David Kimelman, Gilbert Weidinger, Steve Renshaw, Zhiyuan Gong and Jacek Topczewski for zebrafish lines; and Mahendra Sonawane for the Lgl2 antibody.

I have a few concerns:</p><p>1) The evidence that the psoriasis phenotype is caused by a loss-of-function mutation in the <italic>atp1b1a</italic> gene is fairly convincing but the following data should be added to the supplementary information: map showing 10-20 genes on each side of <italic>atp1b1a</italic> as well as a list of any other genes in this region that were sequenced to identify molecular lesions.</p><p>2) In order to tighten the text, it might make sense to move the negative data to the supplementary material (e.g., panels 10c-f; panels 5b-c could also be moved). As it stands, the paper is very long winded.</p><p><italic>Reviewer #2:</italic></p><p>The manuscript entitled &quot;Tumor suppression in basal keratinocytes via dual non-cell-autonomous functions of a Na,K-ATPase β subunit&quot; by Hatzold et al. reports the importance of <italic>atp1b1a</italic> function in prevention of malignancy in the zebrafish epidermis. The authors propose that perturbed cell adhesion, cell polarity in the epidermis and osmotic stress caused due to impaired function of heart and larval kidney contribute towards the development of malignancy. They further show that the osmotic stress results in activation of PI3K-AKT-mTORC1- NFκB-MMP9 pathway in the basal epidermis promoting cell proliferation as well as invasive behavior of the cells. These findings are conceptually interesting and bring into light the importance of osmotic stress in development of malignancy. Following concerns need to be addressed to improve the analyses and to substantiate the authors' claims.</p><p>1) EMT is one of the major hallmarks of Malignancy. The authors should perform live imaging of the basal cells to show EMT in the psoriasis mutant.</p><p>2) The basic premise of this paper is that the loss of cell polarity and adhesion in the periderm secondarily affect the adhesion and polarity in the basal epidermis in psoriasis mutant. These perturbations in cell polarity and adhesion in conjunction with the osmotic stress results in malignant behavior of the basal epidermal cells. If correct, driving expression of <italic>atp1b1a</italic> in the periderm should rescue all the aspects of cell polarity phenotype in the periderm as well as in the basal epidermis and also rescue malignancy in the basal epidermis without affecting the edema phenotype (as the kidney and heart will remain nonfunctional) in hypotonic medium. Authors have just looked at the keratin localization upon driving the expression of <italic>atp1b1a</italic> in the periderm, that too in the isotonic condition, which is not enough. These rescue experiments are crucial for this paper and can be easily done using their transgenic line that drives expression of <italic>atp1b1a-gfp</italic> in periderm under keratin4 promoter.</p><p>3) Authors suggest that the decrease in heart-beats and lowering the blood pressure affects kidney function and leads to edema formation. This is far-fetched in the absence of any solid evidence. It is equally possible that the effect on polarity of kidney epithelial cells results in edema development, which further decreases the heart function.</p><p>4) There is a considerable decrease in Lgl2 localisation in the psoriasis mutant epidermis. This result indicates that Lgl2 localisation requires <italic>atp1b1a</italic> function in the periderm (possibly directly) as well as in the basal epidermis (indirectly?) whereas the interaction studies indicate that <italic>atp1b1a</italic> and <italic>lgl2</italic> have partial redundant functions. Previous studies (Reischauer et al., Westcot et al.) suggest that Lgl has a pro basal function in the basal cells of the developing fin epithelium and that it's loss is enough to cause hyperplasia and EMT. Therefore, it is difficult to interpret the genetic interaction data that authors have. Is it possible that the decrease in Lgl levels contributes to the malignancy phenotype in psoriasis mutant? If yes, can authors rescue the aspects of malignancy by restoring the Lgl levels in psoriasis mutants? Is it that the reduction in Lgl and ATP1b1a levels in the periderm results in malignant phenotypes when morpholinos are coinjected at suboptimal concentrations? Or is it that the reduction in Lgl levels in the basal epidermis and reduction of Atp1b1a in the periderm results in the malignant phenotype when authors co-inject the morpholinos at sub optimal concentrations? What is the status of edema in the larvae injected with the suboptimal concentration of both the morpholinos? Is it the same PI3K-AKT-mTORC1- NFκB-MMP9 pathway that gets activated in the co-injected embryos? In its current form the genetic interaction data does not contribute much towards our understanding of how these two components actually interact and function together in stratified epithelium. If authors wish to include these data in the manuscript a thorough analysis of this part (addressing questions raised above) is required.</p><p>5) The malignant phenotypes are mainly observed in the fins. Are the polarity phenotypes present throughout the epidermis? If yes, how do the authors explain the prevalence of the malignant phenotype in the fin? The expression analysis indicates that <italic>atp1b1a</italic> is expressed mostly in the flank and in the fins. Is this the reason for stronger phenotypes in the fin? In general it will be good if authors mention in the main text where the localization analysis is performed for polarity or adhesion components.</p><p>6) The rescue experiments using inhibitors of signaling pathway components (NFkB, mTOR etc) should be accompanied by BrdU analysis. Since authors argue that these components act in a linear pathway, it is essential to show that inhibition of PI3K restores the pAKT levels in the mutant whereas treatment with Rapamycin and NFkB inhibitor does not reduce the pAKT levels. In addition, a readout for mTOR signaling (phospho S6K) can be used to place mTOR in between PI3K and NFkB.</p><p><italic>Reviewer #2 (Additional data files and statistical comments):</italic></p><p>Since the effect of rapamycin treatment is weaker as compared to the other inhibitors, the number of experimental animals for rapamycin treatment may be increased. The number (n=31) is low, possibly with 9 mutant animals of which 4 do show weak aggregates in the mutant. It would be useful if authors describe the criterion for weak and strong phenotypes.</p><p><italic>Reviewer #3:</italic></p><p>This work describes the very interesting finding that mutation of a Na,K-ATPase regulatory subunit causes in vivo epidermal malignancy by a novel mechanism. The work starts out with a very interesting zebrafish mutant called psoriasis that had previously not been genetically identified (despite much effort), but is identified here with the advent of whole exome sequencing, and found, surprisingly to be the protein mentioned above. This is surprising since one of the hallmarks of psoriasis is the overgrowth of the epidermal cells and an ATPase would not seem an obvious candidate to be a tumor suppressor.</p><p>With the key gene identified, the authors then go on to do a set of very interesting experiments, including showing the very unexpected result that changing the hypotonicity of the growth media inhibits the epidermal growths, revealing a non-autonomous osmoregulatory role of the Na,K-ATPase in these tumors. In addition, they also show that the overgrowth effects on the basal epidermal cells is due to effects in the overlying periderm, again showing a surprising non-autonomous effect. Finally, they also provide molecular details, connecting these changes to the Akt/NFkB pathway.</p><p>This work provides some very interesting findings and shows very nicely how the fish system can be used to figure out complex oncological pathways, and to discover how they are regulated in the whole animal, not just within the tumor per se. This will be of interest to a wide range of readers. There is a large amount of work, and the writing is very clear.

In the legends of these supplementary figures, as well as in the main text (subsection “The <italic>psoriasis</italic> phenotype is caused by a loss-of-function mutation in <italic>atp1b1a</italic> encoding a Na,K-ATPase β-subunit”, first paragraph), we also state that we sequenced the exons of all of these annotated genes.

As it stands, the paper is very long winded.</italic></p><p>We have removed the suggested panels to the Supplement, as well as multiple panels showing representative live images of embryos from additional figures, while just leaving the graphs with the quantifications in the main figures. In addition, to streamline the results on the PI3K-AKT-mTORC1-NFkB, which indeed were long winded, we re-organized former <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8">Figures 8</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig9">9</xref> to one, more systematically structured Figure, in which even more data were integrated, as requested by Reviewer #2 (new <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig9">Figure 9</xref>).</p><p><italic>Reviewer #2:</italic> </p><p> <italic>1) EMT is one of the major hallmarks of Malignancy.

Two representative videos are now supplied as supplemental material, and stills of these two videos are shown as new <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2A, B</xref>. In comparison to wild-type cells, which are very static, <italic>atp1b1a</italic> morphant cells are much more dynamic, with protrusive activity and ongoing dissociation and re-association with neighboring cells. These results are now described in the second paragraph of the subsection “<italic>psoriasis</italic> mutant embryos display characteristics of epidermal malignancy”. We name this behavior a “partial EMT”, similar to what we have formerly observed for morphants lacking the Matriptase inhibitor Hai1a (Carney et al., 2007).</p><p><italic>2) The basic premise of this paper is that the loss of cell polarity and adhesion in the periderm secondarily affect the adhesion and polarity in the basal epidermis in psoriasis mutant. These perturbations in cell polarity and adhesion in conjunction with the osmotic stress results in malignant behavior of the basal epidermal cells. If correct, driving expression of atp1b1a in the periderm should rescue all the aspects of cell polarity phenotype in the periderm as well as in the basal epidermis and also rescue malignancy in the basal epidermis without affecting the edema phenotype (as the kidney and heart will remain nonfunctional) in hypotonic medium. Authors have just looked at the keratin localization upon driving the expression of atp1b1a in the periderm, that too in the isotonic condition, which is not enough. These rescue experiments are crucial for this paper and can be easily done using their transgenic line that drives expression of atp1b1a-gfp in periderm under keratin4 promoter.</italic> </p><p>The reason for having performed the experiments in isotonic medium was to eliminate any effects possibly caused by the systemic hypotonicity, rather than the loss of <italic>atp1b1a</italic> in the periderm. Nevertheless, we have now also incorporated the requested studies of <italic>Tg(krt4:atp1b1a-gfp)–</italic>containing mutants kept in hypotonic medium (additions to <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8">Figure 8</xref> and new <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8s1">Figure 8—figure supplement 1</xref>). Both for epidermal morphology/aggregate formation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8s1">Figure 8—figure supplement 1B, C</xref>), as well as for the malignancy markers pAKT (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8">Figure 8F-H</xref>) and <italic>mmp9</italic> (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8s1">Figure 8—figure supplement 1G, K, O</xref>), we obtained a significant, yet incomplete restoration to wild-type conditions, whereas edema remained unaffected (see <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8s1">Figure 8—figure supplement 1A</xref> for the quantification of epidermal aggregate and edema formation; in addition, for the different stainings, results similar to the shown representatives were obtained for at least 15 out of 15 investigated specimen from at least three independent experiments; subsection “Statistics”). Of note, a similar partial restoration as for the malignancy markers was obtained for the cell polarity markers Lgl2 in the periderm (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8s1">Figure 8—figure supplement 1E, I, M</xref>) and cytokeratin in the basal layer (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8s1">Figure 8—figure supplement 1B, C</xref>). In conclusion, while further supporting the notion that Atp1b1a from the periderm promotes epithelial polarity and suppresses malignancy in basal keratinocytes, the data further indicate that the degrees of polarity defects and epidermal malignancy are proportionally linked. In addition, they suggest that hypotonic stress further challenges the epithelial cell polarity system, which therefore is more difficult to repair by transgene-encoded Atp1b1a from the periderm than under isotonic conditions. In the text of the manuscript, these new data are described and discussed in the last paragraph of the subsection “<italic>atp1b1a</italic> interacts with <italic>lgl2</italic> and is required in peridermal cells to establish proper epithelial organization of basal keratinocytes”.</p><p><italic>3) Authors suggest that the decrease in heart-beats and lowering the blood pressure affects kidney function and leads to edema formation. This is far-fetched in the absence of any solid evidence. It is equally possible that the effect on polarity of kidney epithelial cells results in edema development, which further decreases the heart function.</italic></p><p>We never meant to claim this and actually don’t think we did. But, we have re-written the corresponding paragraphs in the Results (subsection “<italic>atp1b1a</italic> is required for proper heart and pronephric function”) and Discussion (subsection “The role of Atp1b1a in kidney and heart to avoid systemic hypotonicty”) to point out more clearly the direct effects of loss of Atp1b1a function in pronephric epithelial cells as the likely primary cause of aberrant osmoregulation. In the Discussion, we also mention that in addition to the mislocalization of the pump’s α subunit, epithelial polarity of renal epithelial cells might be generally compromised.</p><p><italic>4) There is a considerable decrease in Lgl2 localisation in the psoriasis mutant epidermis. This result indicates that Lgl2 localisation requires atp1b1a function in the periderm (possibly directly) as well as in the basal epidermis (indirectly?) whereas the interaction studies indicate that atp1b1a and lgl2 have partial redundant functions. Previous studies (Reischauer et al., Westcot et al.) suggest that Lgl has a pro basal function in the basal cells of the developing fin epithelium and that it's loss is enough to cause hyperplasia and EMT. Therefore, it is difficult to interpret the genetic interaction data that authors have. Is it possible that the decrease in Lgl levels contributes to the malignancy phenotype in psoriasis mutant? If yes, can authors rescue the aspects of malignancy by restoring the Lgl levels in psoriasis mutants? Is it that the reduction in Lgl and ATP1b1a levels in the periderm results in malignant phenotypes when morpholinos are coinjected at suboptimal concentrations? Or is it that the reduction in Lgl levels in the basal epidermis and reduction of Atp1b1a in the periderm results in the malignant phenotype when authors co-inject the morpholinos at sub optimal concentrations? What is the status of edema in the larvae injected with the suboptimal concentration of both the morpholinos? Is it the same PI3K-AKT-mTORC1- NFκB-MMP9 pathway that gets activated in the co-injected embryos? In its current form the genetic interaction data does not contribute much towards our understanding of how these two components actually interact and function together in stratified epithelium. If authors wish to include these data in the manuscript a thorough analysis of this part (addressing questions raised above) is required.</italic> </p><p>In general, we agree with the Reviewing Editor (who did not mark this point as an essential revision) that these proposed experiments, although interesting, are beyond the scope of this manuscript, as its main focus is on the tumor-suppressive role of ATP1b1a, and not on it’s the mechanisms underlying its cooperation with Lgl2. The main reason to show the genetic interaction between the two was the desire to provide a further line of evidence that ATP1b1a regulates epithelial cell polarity of epidermal cells. Therefore, we very much prefer to leave these interaction data in the manuscript, in particular, as we now have added at least some (in our opinion the most crucial) of the proposed new experiments. Thus, we now show that embryos co-injected with sub-phenotypic doses of <italic>atp1b1a</italic> and <italic>lgl2</italic> MOs also display edema formation and a down-regulation of Na/K-ATPase α-subunits in basolateral domains of pronephric epithelial cells, as well as an up-regulation of pAKT levels and <italic>mmp9</italic> expression in basal keratinocytes. Moreover, we show that the epidermal aggregates, but not the edema, are rescued upon treatment with the chemical PI3K, mTORC1 and NFkB inhibitors (new <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7s1">Figure 7—figure supplement 1</xref>). We conclude that ATP1b1a and Lgl2 most likely cooperate both in the epidermis (periderm) and in the pronephros to suppress epidermal malignancy. These new findings are now described and discussed in the first paragraph of the subsection “<italic>atp1b1a</italic> interacts with lgl2 and is required in peridermal cells to establish proper epithelial organization of basal keratinocytes”, and in the subsection “The cooperation between Atp1b1a and Lgl2”.</p><p><italic>5) The malignant phenotypes are mainly observed in the fins. Are the polarity phenotypes present throughout the epidermis? If yes, how do the authors explain the prevalence of the malignant phenotype in the fin? The expression analysis indicates that atp1b1a is expressed mostly in the flank and in the fins. Is this the reason for stronger phenotypes in the fin? In general it will be good if authors mention in the main text where the localization analysis is performed for polarity or adhesion components.</italic> </p><p>We now show that the malignant phenotypes (epidermal aggregates) also occur on the flank, the yolk sac, and the head of the mutant embryos, so basically everywhere (new <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1E-G</xref>). Generally, for our molecular analyses of polarity and malignancy markers, we tried to avoid regions within epidermal aggregates, as the altered spatial organization of the epidermis in these aggregates makes it very difficult to image the molecular alterations at higher magnifications. However, the same molecular alterations were seen within aggregates and in inter-aggregate regions, independent of their position on median fins, flank, yolk sac or head. Anyway, we now state in the figure legends where the images were taken.</p><p><italic>6) The rescue experiments using inhibitors of signaling pathway components (NFkB, mTOR etc) should be accompanied by BrdU analysis.</italic> </p><p>BrdU incorporation analyses have been added to the more systematically structured new <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig9">Figure 9</xref> (panels K-K’’’’).</p><p><italic>Since authors argue that these components act in a linear pathway, it is essential to show that inhibition of PI3K restores the pAKT levels in the mutant whereas treatment with Rapamycin and NFkB inhibitor does not reduce the pAKT levels.</italic> </p><p>We had already shown in the last version of the manuscript that pAKT levels were restored by wortmannin (reduced), whereas they remained high after Whitaferin-A treatment.
