RNAs (ncRNAs) generated by repetitive elements and their connection with pathologic processes remains elusive. B2 RNAs, a class of ncRNAs of the B2 family of SINE repeats, mediate through their processing the transcriptional activation of various genes in response to stress. Here, we show that this response is dysfunctional during amyloid beta toxicity and pathology in the mouse hippocampus due to increased levels of B2 RNA processing, leading to constitutively elevated B2 RNA target gene expression and high <italic>Trp53</italic> levels. Evidence indicates that Hsf1, a master regulator of stress response, mediates B2 RNA processing in hippocampal cells and is activated during amyloid toxicity, accelerating the processing of SINE RNAs and gene hyper-activation. Our study reveals that in mouse, SINE RNAs constitute a novel pathway deregulated in amyloid beta pathology, with potential implications for similar cases in the human brain, such as Alzheimer’s disease (AD).</p></abstract><kwd-group kwd-group-type="author-keywords"><kwd>non-coding RNAs</kwd><kwd>SINE</kwd><kwd>B2 RNA</kwd><kwd>hippocampus</kwd><kwd>transcriptome</kwd><kwd>amyloid beta

is expected to skyrocket in the upcoming years (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Cornutiu, 2015</xref>). The exact molecular mechanisms underlying AD are not fully understood, a fact that is underlined by the inauspicious results of recent clinical trials for potential therapeutic agents (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Hane et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Cummings et al., 2019</xref>). Amyloid pathology, and particularly, amyloid beta peptides and their aggregated forms have been connected with AD pathogenesis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Bloom, 2014</xref>) as well as with neurotoxicity in mouse models of amyloid pathology (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Ittner et al., 2010</xref>). Nevertheless, the transcriptome changes involved in cell stress response to amyloid toxicity in brains with extensive amyloid beta pathology are still not entirely clear. The hippocampus is a primary target of amyloid pathology in humans. In healthy hippocampi, among the genes that have been implicated in transcriptome-environment interactions are stress response genes (SRGs) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Gallo et al., 2018</xref>). These genes have been initially described in other biological contexts, such as thermal and oxidative stress, as pro-survival genes activated early after the application of a stress stimulus, such as heat shock, that help the cell overcome the stress condition (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Mahat et al., 2016</xref>). However, in addition to the cellular response to stress, many SRGs were shown to have a central role in the function of the mouse hippocampus, by mediating cell signaling and genome-environment interactions. In particular, we and others have shown that in the healthy hippocampus during neural response to environmental stimuli, SRGs, such as those of the MAPK pathway, are transiently activated during various hippocampal processes including learning and response to cellular stress (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">Peleg et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib45">Yutsudo et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">Sananbenesi et al., 2003</xref>). Activation of SRGs is followed by a transient upregulation of the pro-apoptotic factor <italic>Trp53</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">Peleg et al., 2010</xref>) and, subsequently, of a pro-apoptotic miRNA, <italic>Mir34c</italic>, which are transiently induced by and as a response to the activation of pro-survival SRGs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib46">Zovoilis et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib43">Yamakuchi and Lowenstein, 2009</xref>). <italic>Trp53</italic> activates the expression of genes engaged in promoting cell death in response to multiple forms of cellular stress including <italic>Mir34c</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib43">Yamakuchi and Lowenstein, 2009</xref>). This miRNA acts transiently as a guard and fine tuner of the expression of many SRGs by targeting them, thus, creating a negative feedback regulatory loop that keeps SRG expression in healthy cells under strict control. This facilitates the return to the pro-stimulation state in approximately 3 hr after the application of the stimulus (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib46">Zovoilis et al., 2011</xref>). In contrast, hippocampi of mouse models of amyloid pathology and postmortem brains of human patients of AD are characterized by abnormally high <italic>Mir34c</italic> levels that subsequently can lead to prolonged high <italic>Trp53</italic> levels and neural death (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib46">Zovoilis et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib43">Yamakuchi and Lowenstein, 2009</xref>). Given that many SRGs are upstream regulators of <italic>Trp53-Mir34c</italic> activation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Gao et al., 2010</xref>), high <italic>Trp53</italic> and <italic>Mir34c</italic> levels in amyloid pathology implied a possible transcriptome deregulation of the pathways that involve SRGs but whether such a deregulation exists, and which is the mechanism underlying this, it remained unknown. Interestingly, in a recent publication, we showed that expression of a number of SRGs is regulated by a class of non-protein coding (non-coding) RNAs called B2 SINE RNAs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib47">Zovoilis et al., 2016</xref>), raising the possibility that these non-coding RNAs may be a missing link in the pathways connecting amyloid beta toxicity with transcriptome changes in mouse hippocampus during amyloid pathology.</p><p>SINE non-coding RNAs are transcribed by repetitive small interspersed nuclear elements (SINEs), with the subclass B2-repetitive elements being one of the most frequent in mouse (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Kramerov and Vassetzky, 2011</xref>). SINE B2 elements, which are retrotransposons present in hundreds of thousands of copies, are part of the non-protein coding genome, and over the long haul, they have been regarded as genomic parasites and ‘junk DNA’ with no function (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Karijolich et al., 2017</xref>). However, SINE B2 elements can be transcribed by RNA Polymerase III into SINE B2 RNAs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Kramerov and Vassetzky, 2011</xref>) and a number of recent studies have revealed a key role for SINE B2 RNAs in cellular response to stress. In particular, studies from the J. Kugel and J. Goodrich labs have shown that during response to cellular stress, levels of SINE B2 RNAs increase and suppress the transcription of a number of housekeeping genes through binding of RNA Polymerase II (RNA Pol II), potentially facilitating the redirection of cell resources to pro-survival pathways (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib42">Yakovchuk et al., 2009</xref>). In addition, we have recently shown that SINE B2 RNAs mediate cellular response to stress through the regulation of pro-survival stress response genes by acting as transcriptional switches. In particular, in the pro-cellular stress state SINE B2 RNAs bind RNA Pol II at several SRGs and suppress their transcription. In this way, stalled or delayed RNA Pol II remains poised for a fast activation and ramp-up of transcription when needed. Upon application of a stress stimulus, SINE B2 RNAs, which have a self-cleavage activity that is accelerated by their interaction with a protein (Ezh2) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Hernandez et al., 2020</xref>), are processed into unstable fragments that lack the ability to bind and suppress RNA Pol II. This event releases the delayed or stalled RNA Pol II and enables fast transcriptional activation of stress response genes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib47">Zovoilis et al., 2016</xref>).</p><p>The above findings have revealed a novel role in cellular function for processing of SINE B2 RNAs (hereafter referred simply as B2 RNAs) through the activation of a number of SRGs regulated by them (hereafter called B2-SRGs). However, an association of the processing and destabilization of B2 RNAs with any pathological cellular process remains unknown. Here, given the importance of SRGs in hippocampal neuronal function, we examine whether this newly described B2 RNA-SRG regulatory mechanism is linked with pathological processes, focusing on transcriptome response to amyloid beta toxicity and pathology. To this end, we investigate whether B2-SRGs are indeed deregulated during amyloid pathology, which would imply a role for B2 RNAs in this condition and we examine whether amyloid toxicity is connected with changes in B2 RNA processing. Subsequently, we investigate the further upstream molecular mechanisms underlying any potential deregulation of B2 RNA processing in response to amyloid toxicity in hippocampal neural cells.</p></sec><sec id="s2" sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><sec id="s2-1"><title>B2 RNA regulated SRGs (B2-SRGs) are enriched in neural functions</title><p>In a previous study, we have identified genomic locations that are subject to regulation by SINE B2 non-coding RNAs during response to thermal stress (heat shock) through binding and suppression of transcription by the RNA Pol II at the pre-stimulus state. Upon induction of cellular stress through the application of a stimulus, SRGs in these locations become activated through B2 processing and release of RNA Pol II suppression (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1A</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib47">Zovoilis et al., 2016</xref>). A list of B2-SRGs at these locations is available in <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="supp1">Supplementary file 1</xref>. Response to thermal stress (heat shock) has been used for years as a basic study model of cellular response to stress. Proteins and gene pathways initially identified in heat shock have been subsequently shown to play identical pro-survival roles in other biological systems. Thus, we questioned whether there are other known cellular functions, beyond response to heat shock, that are connected with B2-SRGs.</p><fig id="fig1" position="float"><label>Figure 1.</label><caption><title>B2-SRGs are enriched in neural functions.</title><p>(<bold>A</bold>) Regulation mode of SRGs by B2 RNA processing based on previous works (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib47">Zovoilis et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib42">Yakovchuk et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Ponicsan et al., 2010</xref>).

A potential role of B2-SRGs, that include many learning genes, in affecting this loop in amyloid pathology remained unknown after these studies (noted with a question mark in the figure).</p></caption><graphic mime-subtype="tiff" mimetype="image" xlink:href="elife-61265-fig1-v2.tif"/></fig><p>As shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1B</xref>, after performing a tissue enrichment analysis to identify tissue terms that are over-represented in the list of our SRGs, we found a significant enrichment of neural tissue terms compared to other tissues in our list. Similarly, during Gene Ontology term enrichment analysis, cellular compartments closely related to neural functions top the list of enriched terms in these genes, including among the first 10 entries terms such as synapse, postsynaptic density and membrane, dendrites, neural projections, and pre-synaptic membrane (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1C</xref>, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="supp1">Supplementary file 1</xref>). Most importantly, after performing the same analysis for Biological Processes GO terms, B2-SRGs were found to be enriched considerably in neural-function-related terms. GO terms such as learning, nervous system development, synaptic transmission, synapse receptor localization, and neurotransmitter transport were among the first 10 entries with the highest adjusted p value scores enriched in B2-SRGs (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1D</xref>, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="supp1">Supplementary file 1</xref>).</p><p>Among the biological processes potentially affected by B2 RNAs that were identified above was learning. We and others have already shown that learning processes in the mouse hippocampus are connected with the transient activation of a number of learning-associated genes and pathways, including many known SRGs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">Peleg et al., 2010</xref>). For this reason, we examined whether any learning-associated genes are among the binding targets of B2 RNAs. To this end, we compared the distribution of B2 RNA binding sites in the genome between learning-associated genes and all genes. Indeed, as shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1E</xref>, B2 RNA-binding sites were found to be enriched in learning-associated genes compared to other genes. In particular, based on learning-associated genes previously identified in mouse hippocampus (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">Peleg et al., 2010</xref>), among the B2-SRGs (1684 genes), 102 genes (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1E</xref>, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="supp1">Supplementary file 1</xref>) are associated with learning. In addition, biological process terms enriched in B2-SRGs included, among others, pathways implicated with response to cellular stress in neural cells, and various genes implicated with synaptic function (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1E</xref>, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="supp1">Supplementary file 1</xref>).</p><p>This data suggests that B2-SRGs could potentially affect a wide spectrum of functions beyond heat shock including response to cellular stress in neural cells, synaptic function, and learning. All these biological processes are heavily impaired in AD. Given the role of hippocampus as a primary target of amyloid pathology in AD, we decided to expand our investigation towards the potential role of B2-SRGs regulation in this pathological process. We have previously shown that in hippocampus the pro-apoptotic miRNA <italic>Mir34c</italic>, which is induced among others by <italic>Trp53</italic> and controls it in a negative feedback loop manner (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib43">Yamakuchi and Lowenstein, 2009</xref>), targets many learning-associated genes in order to help to restore their expression and <italic>Trp53</italic> expression levels after application of a stimulus (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1F</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib46">Zovoilis et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib43">Yamakuchi and Lowenstein, 2009</xref>). In both mouse models of amyloid beta pathology and AD patient brains, we found persistently high levels of <italic>Mir34c</italic>. High <italic>Mir34c</italic> levels in hippocampi with amyloid pathology are indicative of a transcriptome-wide deregulation of <italic>Trp53</italic> and associated genes, as many of these genes are either direct or indirect upstream regulators of <italic>Mir34c</italic> (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1F</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">Rokavec et al., 2014</xref>). Since, as shown above, B2-SRGs include many learning genes as well as other genes involved in neural function, we questioned whether such transcriptome changes in response to amyloid pathology involve B2-SRGs.</p></sec><sec id="s2-2"><title>A number of B2-SRGs get hyper-activated during the neurodegeneration phase of amyloid pathology</title><p>To test whether B2-SRGs are indeed deregulated in amyloid pathology, we employed a transgenic mouse model of amyloid pathology, APP<sup>NL-G-F</sup> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">Saito et al., 2014</xref>), and the respective wild-type control (C57BL/6J).

Thus, it cannot be excluded that the expression pattern observed in genes of <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2</xref> may extend to additional B2-SRGs described in our previous work that have been filtered out by DEseq. This could be attributed to our current sequencing depth and the large dynamic range of some of them as shown in panel E, but also due to genome wide mRNA expression level changes in our system that are not taken into account by DEseq’s conservative hypothesis that expression levels of most genes remain unchanged. This is relevant in our case given the ability of full-length B2 RNAs (which are elevated in our system) to suppress global gene expression and thus, it may have resulted in a number of genes being filtered out during DESeq correction for multiple testing.</p></caption><graphic mime-subtype="tiff" mimetype="image" xlink:href="elife-61265-fig2-figsupp3-v2.tif"/></fig></fig-group><p>We have focused on three different mouse ages that correspond to different phases of amyloid beta pathology and represent the: (i) pre-symptomatic stage with undetectable (very low) amyloid plaque load (3 months - 3 m, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2B</xref> left panels), (ii) stage of symptom manifestation (6 months - 6 m) that coincides with the active neurodegeneration phase and appearance of amyloid plaques (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2B</xref>, middle-panels), and (iii) terminal stage of the pathology (12 months - 12 m, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2B</xref> right panels) when mice have already acquired the extensive brain atrophy due to neural cell death. Whole hippocampi from mice of these three groups were isolated and the extracted RNA was subjected to next-generation sequencing. We performed directional RNA sequencing for these samples and subsequently quantified gene expression levels.

Differential expression analysis at this time point revealed a number of genes that are upregulated in 6-month-old APP mice (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="supp1">Supplementary file 1</xref>), including 72 B2-SRGs among them (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="supp1">Supplementary file 1</xref>), of which 13 are learning associated (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="supp1">Supplementary file 1</xref>).

Consistent with a hypothesis of a transcriptome-wide deregulation that involves B2-SRGs, levels of the 72 B2-SRGs were found to be strongly upregulated during the active phase of neurodegeneration at 6 months (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2D–F</xref>). In particular, in healthy hippocampi (WT control animals), levels of these genes are normally downregulated in 6-month and 12-month-old mice compared to 3-month-old mice (<italic>p=0.02 and p=0.05, respectively</italic>) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2E</xref>). This is in accordance with the higher level of neural synaptic activity and plasticity that younger mice have (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Lilja et al., 2013</xref>). In contrast, levels of B2-SRGs in APP mice remain abnormally high in 6-month-old APP mice compared to the 6-month-old control mice (p&lt;0.05) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2E and F</xref>).

To estimate this ratio, we used the short RNA-seq data in combination with standard long-RNA-seq. As in our previous study, for normalization of short RNA 5′ end values we used a class of short RNAs that is not affected by B2 RNAs, the RNA Pol III-transcribed tRNAs and estimated the levels of B2 RNA processing fragments (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3E</xref>). Moreover, the absolute numbers of fragmented B2 RNA may vary according to the underlying expression of full-length B2 RNA transcripts. Therefore, in order to factor in any differences in the amount of fragments due to basal expression levels of the full-length B2 RNA, full-length B2 RNA levels were calculated by the directional long-RNA-seq (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3F</xref>). The long-RNA-seq approach excludes short fragments, and subsequently, B2 RNA fragment values from short RNA-seq were normalized to the levels of the full-length B2 RNAs to calculate the processing ratio. Consistent with our hypothesis and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3A</xref> findings, 6-month-old APP mice were found to have substantially increased ratio of B2 RNA processing compared to control mice of the same age (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3G</xref>) (p&lt;<italic>0.05</italic>, n = 3/group). This increase was observed only in the 6-month-old mice (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3G</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s2">Figure 3—figure supplement 2</xref>) and coincides with the increase in <italic>Trp53</italic> levels and B2-SRGs levels observed in this age.</p><p>Thus, APP mice at the active neurodegeneration phase are characterized by higher destabilization and processing ratio of B2 RNAs, consistent with the observed increase in B2-SRG levels in these same animals.</p></sec><sec id="s2-4"><title>Hsf1 accelerates B2 RNA processing</title><p>We then focused on the molecular mechanism underlying the increased B2 RNA processing during response to amyloid toxicity. When we had previously examined the mechanism of B2 RNA processing in non-neural cells (NIH/3T3 cells during heat shock), a member of the PRC2 protein complex, Ezh2, was reported as being responsible for the B2-RNA-accelerated destabilization and processing during response to stress (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib47">Zovoilis et al., 2016</xref>). However, as shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s1">Figure 4—figure supplement 1A–B</xref>, scant expression levels of Ezh2 levels in neural cells indicate that Ezh2 is not a key factor in B2 RNA processing in brain. Thus, the factors that may mediate destabilization for B2 RNAs during stress in neural cells remain elusive.</p><p>In our earlier study that described the induction of B2 RNA processing by Ezh2, it remained unclear how Ezh2 exerted its impact on B2 RNAs, since Ezh2 lacked any known RNAse activity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib47">Zovoilis et al., 2016</xref>). However, in subsequent experiments (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Hernandez et al., 2020</xref>), we showed that instability is in fact inherent to the B2 RNA molecule while interaction with Ezh2 only accelerates this destabilization and Ezh2 does not cleave B2 RNA by itself. This finding suggests that other proteins may have a similar effect on B2 RNA stability. Therefore, we started searching for stress-related candidate proteins that could affect the B2 RNA processing.</p><p>We showed before that, during response to stress in NIH/3T3 cells, B2 RNA binding is enriched near stalled RNA polymerase genomic sites. These areas are known to be highly enriched in binding sites of various stress related proteins, among which Hsf1, a master regulator of stress response for various types of cellular stress (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Pandey et al., 2011</xref>). Hsf1 has been previously connected with activation of SRGs through both transcriptional factor (TF) activities as well as other yet unknown TF-independent processes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Inouye et al., 2007</xref>). Interestingly, when we examined the proximity of Hsf1 binding sites, identified by the Lis lab (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Mahat et al., 2016</xref>), to genes with B2 RNA binding sites (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="supp1">Supplementary file 1</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib47">Zovoilis et al., 2016</xref>), we found that increased number of Hsf1-binding sites were found near B2-SRGs (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s1">Figure 4—figure supplement 1C</xref>) and were further enriched after application of a heat-shock stimulus (KS-test &lt;0.05).

In particular, we incubated full-length B2 RNA with the Hsf1 protein in vitro. As shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5A</xref>, in the presence of Hsf1, the destabilization of full-length B2 RNA was accelerated in contrast to the control protein (PNK) or in the absence of protein (no protein). No processing was observed in an RNA fragment co-incubated with B2 RNA and the protein (marked with an asterisk across <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5</xref>).

We previously showed that cleavage in SINE B2 RNAs controls response to cellular stress through activation of stress response genes in heat shock. However, no connection between this novel molecular mechanism and pathologic processes was until now known. Moreover, since B2 RNAs are intrinsically reactive, and contact with Ezh2 only accelerates cleavage, it remained plausible that other stress-related proteins may also have a similar effect on accelerating B2 RNA processing, which would link this ribozyme-like property to stress response through pathways other than Ezh2. This is especially relevant in mouse tissues, such as the brain, where Ezh2 expression is limited, an expression pattern observed also in human (Human Protein Atlas) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib41">Uhlén et al., 2015</xref>).</p><p>Here, we unveil increased processing of SINE B2 RNAs as a novel type of transcriptome deregulation underlying amyloid beta neuro-pathology. Our data provides a new link in the murine hippocampal pathways connecting amyloid beta toxicity with transcriptome changes in SRGs through processing of B2 RNAs. In particular, the B2 RNA processing ratio increases upon progression of amyloid pathology both in mouse hippocampus and a hippocampal cell culture model, and B2-SRGs become hyperactivated. Consistent with the spatial proximity between B2-SRGs and Hsf1 binding sites, Hsf1 proved to be key for mediating B2 RNA processing in response to amyloid toxicity. This correlation is observed throughout all sequencing experiments performed in this study (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8s1">Figure 8—figure supplement 1</xref>). Our work assigns to <italic>Hsf1</italic> a new function that is independent of its long-established transcription factor function and includes the interaction with and processing of SINE B2 RNAs. The high levels of <italic>Hsf1</italic> trigger a downstream cascade of events which are orchestrated into a cell-wide, SRG-mediated response to stress conditions. This axis is mediated by the ability of B2 RNA to get processed and, thus, act as a molecular switch. Although healthy cells and animals are able to restore the expression levels of <italic>Hsf1</italic>, SRGs and their regulating B2 RNAs upon removal of the stress-generating stimulus, the amyloid beta load in our biological models acts as a continuous stimulus that causes the <italic>Hsf1</italic> - B2 RNA - SRG axis to ‘lock’ into an activated mode.

Thus, our findings here on a potential role of B2 RNAs in the context of neural response to stress constitute a natural continuation of our previous study in heat shock (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib47">Zovoilis et al., 2016</xref>). The fact that B2-SRGs identified in our previous study were found in the current study to be highly enriched in neuronal tissue related biological processes terms and compartments was what has compelled us to investigate further a potential role of B2 RNAs in neural tissue-associated pathologies.</p><p>In this study, we employed a mouse model of amyloid pathology in order to test the impact of increased amyloid beta load on B2 RNA processing in vivo. This mouse model has the NL- G-F mutations in the amyloid precursor protein knocked-in to a C57BL genomic background, with each mutation contributing to an increased severity and speed manifestation of the disease (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Mehla et al., 2019</xref>). The combined effect of the APPNL−G−F mutations results in mice that experience rapid onset of AD-like symptoms at approximately 6 months (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Mehla et al., 2019</xref>). This is exactly the time point that we observed the massive hyper-activation of B2 RNA SRGs, <italic>Trp53</italic>, and B2 RNA processing, suggesting that these changes constitute a molecular signature for the active neurodegenerative phase months, before the end state of 12 months that the mice develop terminal AD-like pathology and symptoms.</p><p>Interestingly, symptoms and molecular changes are not observed in younger APP mice suggesting the existence of a yet unknown protective mechanism against increased neuronal activity of SRGs in 3-month-old APP mice. This may be attributed to the increased neuronal plasticity observed in younger brains (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Lilja et al., 2013</xref>), which suggest that mechanisms in the younger brain may exist for counter-acting this excessive activity. In particular, stress response genes such as <italic>Fosb</italic> have been shown to participate in specification of cell-type-specific activity-dependent gene programs early in development (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib44">Yap and Greenberg, 2018</xref>). In contrast, during aging, B2-SRG activity in WT mice ramps down, which is not the case in APP mice (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2</xref>), explaining at the molecular level the increased <italic>Trp53</italic> levels and subsequent activation of cell death (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1F</xref>). Our findings for B2 RNA SRG upregulation and B2 RNA increased processing coincide with the active neurodegeneration phase of amyloid pathology but in later stages the effect is not that prominent. This suggests that the initial active phase differs from the terminal stage regarding role of B2 RNA. As in the terminal stage a large number of cells have already died, B2 processing activation appears to be more connected with the initial response of cells to amyloid toxicity.</p><p>The B2-RNA-mediated regulation of gene expression during stress identified in one biological context may be relevant to a broad range of cellular types and disease pathophysiology. In the current study, to identify examples of genes that are subject to B2 RNA regulation in hippocampus molecular pathology we utilized the gene list of B2-SRGs identified in our previous study in heat shock. Of the previously identified 1684 B2-SRGs, we found here 72 genes that are deregulated specifically during the active neurodegeneration phase in hippocampal cells. However, this does not exclude the possibility that beyond these 72 genes, B2 RNA processing may also affect expression of additional B2-SRGs that are associated with other hippocampal functions that are independent of amyloid beta pathology. To get a better insight into this possibility, we tested the correlation between the gene expression of other B2-SRGs and the B2 RNA processing ratio, independently of amyloid beta status. In particular, for each of these genes we have calculated the Pearson correlation coefficient between gene expression levels and B2 RNA processing ratio in the hippocampal samples of the current study. As shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8s1">Figure 8—figure supplement 1E</xref>, we have been able to calculate a statistically significant correlation coefficient for at least 659 genes (the rest where either not sufficiently expressed in all samples or returned a p value &gt; 0.05). From these 659 genes, expression of 344 genes (52.2%) showed a strong correlation with B2 RNA processing ratio (r ≥ 0.5), while an additional 75 genes (11.3%) showed a weak correlation (0.5 &gt; r ≥ 0.25), and only 240 genes (36.4%) had an r &lt; 0.25 and no correlation. This data suggests that for a large number of the B2-SRGs previously identified in the context of heat shock, correlation between gene expression and B2 RNA processing ratio holds true also in the context of hippocampal cells.</p><p>During our amyloid toxicity experiments, cells inoculated with the reverse peptide and the anti-<italic>Hsf1</italic> LNA did not show any reduction in <italic>Hsf1</italic> levels in contrast to those inoculated with amyloid beta (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8">Figure 8B</xref>). This could be attributed to compensation during non-stress conditions. In contrast, under stress conditions, when <italic>Hsf1</italic> is heavily used due to stress response, cellular needs surpass the available <italic>Hsf1</italic> transcripts that are continuously depleted by the LNA. This is also in agreement with levels of B2-SRGs in this condition (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8">Figure 8E</xref>), which are minimal in both R-ctrl and R-anti-<italic>Hsf1</italic> conditions and only get activated during stress response to the amyloid beta in the 42-ctrl condition.</p><p>Our study leaves a number of open questions. Particularly, our study raises the question whether a similar mode of regulation of SRGs by SINE RNAs may exist also in human and which SINE RNAs could play such a role. Similarly to B2 RNA, such SINE RNAs would be able to bind and inhibit RNA Pol II and would be subject to a similar RNA processing mechanism enabling the release of RNA Pol II. A number of studies have described that in human, repetitive SINE RNAs of the Alu class are also upregulated during cellular stress and can bind RNA Pol II inhibiting the transcription of target genes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib42">Yakovchuk et al., 2009</xref>). Alu RNAs are widely regarded as the equivalent in human of B2 RNA. Most importantly, as we showed before, human Alu RNAs, alike B2 RNAs, are self-cleaving RNAs and can become destabilized in vitro (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Hernandez et al., 2020</xref>). It remains unknown whether SINE RNAs and <italic>Hsf1</italic> play a similar role in amyloid pathology in the case of humans and whether we can extrapolate the generated conclusions in murine models to deduce that SINE RNAs are key components of the pathophysiological mechanisms underlying debilitating diseases such as AD. One major limitation compared to human pathophysiology is that the phenotype of amyloid pathology is not observed in mice even during aging. Nonetheless, a stress-central role of Alu RNAs, the human counterpart of B2 RNAs is plausible and, thus, future studies need to elucidate whether Alu RNA processing is also hyperactivated in the brain of patients with amyloid pathology in the context of AD.</p><p>Moreover, in the RNA-seq data one cannot distinguish between Pol III transcribed B2 RNA and Pol II transcribed B2 RNA (typically embedded within introns and UTRs of mRNAs). To get an indication whether such transcripts may contribute to our data, we have separated the B2 elements against which we map the RNA fragments into two categories, those that fall within exonic/genic regions and those outside these regions (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s2">Figure 3—figure supplement 2</xref>). Although B2 RNAs are produced by multiple copies in the genome, each copy does harbor multiple SNPs, insertions and deletions, which means that each B2 RNA fragment is mapped to a specific set of B2 elements and not to all of them. Thus, despite multiple mapping of the reads, a level of spatial specificity is maintained. If the B2 RNAs we map were coming exclusively from either only Pol III B2 elements or mRNA-embedded B2 elements, we would expect at least some difference in the distribution of fragments between B2 elements of these two categories, as the second one overlaps with mRNAs. However, as shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s2">Figure 3—figure supplement 2</xref>, the fact that distribution models are very similar between the two categories supports the hypothesis that both types of B2 elements may contribute to B2 RNA processing. Thus, it cannot be excluded whether the regulatory role of B2 RNAs may extend from Pol III transcribed B2 RNAs into B2 RNAs embedded into mRNAs (likely nascent ones) that may be also under the same endogenous ribozyme activity of this sequence, may suppress Pol II and get processed in response to stimuli.</p><p>Our results suggest that B2 RNA regulation is a new process implicated in response to stress in amyloid pathology but it is definitely not the only one. Since B2-SRGs are highly interconnected and interweaved into various pathways, the impact of SRG hyperactivation by B2 RNA processing may extend to pathways that lie downstream of SRGs and affect various gene programs without binding directly B2 RNA. However, here it should be noted that high levels of <italic>Hsf1</italic> are certainly expected to affect transcription also through Hsf1’s conventional transcriptional factor function while there are still many SRGs that are not directly regulated by B2 RNA. Thus, B2 RNA processing described here does not constitute the only one but just one of the parameters in the equation of SRG regulation. It remains unclear which is the interplay between Hsf1 traditional transcription factor activities and its ability to affect B2 RNA processing and whether there is any overlap or synergies. For example, it remains unclear what percentage of activated genes are activated though Hsf1 DNA binding and what through binding of B2 RNA and subsequent release of suppressed Pol II activity.</p><p>Moreover, given how easily B2 RNA is processed in the presence of certain proteins, Hsf1 may be only one of the factors accelerating B2 processing in mouse hippocampus as we are just beginning to understand the implications of this form of SINE RNA regulation in cells. A broader role of SINE RNA processing in brain physiology and pathophysiology constitutes, thus, a significant possibility that could further revise our understanding of these RNAs as something more than just transcriptional noise and ‘junk DNA’ products.</p></sec><sec id="s4" sec-type="materials|methods"><title>Materials and methods</title><table-wrap id="keyresource" position="anchor"><label>Key resources table</label><table frame="hsides" rules="groups"><thead><tr><th valign="top">Reagent type <break/>(species) or resource</th><th valign="top">Designation</th><th valign="top">Source or reference</th><th valign="top">Identifiers</th><th valign="top">Additional information</th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td valign="top">Cell line <break/>(<italic>Mus musculus</italic>)</td><td valign="top">HT-22</td><td valign="top">Millipore Sigma</td><td valign="top">Cat#SCC129, RRID:<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://scicrunch.org/resolver/CVCL_0321">CVCL_0321</ext-link></td><td valign="top"/></tr><tr><td valign="top">Sequence-based reagent</td><td valign="top">Amyloid Beta peptides ( 1-42)</td><td valign="top">Sigma-Aldrich</td><td valign="top">Custom synthesis</td><td valign="top">DAEFRHDSGYEVHHQKLVFFAEDVGSNKGAIIGLMVGGVVIA</td></tr><tr><td valign="top">Sequence-based reagent</td><td valign="top">Amyloid Beta peptides (Reverse 42–1)</td><td valign="top">Sigma-Aldrich</td><td valign="top">Custom synthesis</td><td valign="top">AIVVGGVMLGIIAGKNSGVDEAFFVLKQHHVEYGSDHRFEAD</td></tr><tr><td valign="top">Peptide, recombinant protein</td><td valign="top"><italic>Hsf1</italic> protein</td><td valign="top">Enzo life sciences</td><td valign="top">ADI-SPP-902-F</td><td valign="top">Synthesized in insect, human sequence</td></tr><tr><td valign="top">Commercial assay, kit</td><td valign="top">NEBNext Small RNA Library Prep set</td><td valign="top">NEB</td><td valign="top">Cat# E7330</td><td valign="top"/></tr><tr><td valign="top">Commercial assay, kit</td><td valign="top">NEBNext Ultra II directional RNA library prep kit</td><td valign="top">NEB</td><td valign="top">Cat# E7760</td><td valign="top"/></tr><tr><td valign="top">Commercial assay, kit</td><td valign="top">Superscript III RT</td><td valign="top">Invitrogen</td><td valign="top">Cat# 18080093</td><td valign="top"/></tr><tr><td valign="top">Commercial assay, kit</td><td valign="top">Luna universal master mix</td><td valign="top">NEB</td><td valign="top">Cat# M3003</td><td valign="top"/></tr><tr><td valign="top">Antibody</td><td valign="top"><italic>Anti-Hsf1</italic> <break/>(Rabbit, polyclonal)</td><td valign="top">Enzo</td><td valign="top">Cat# ADI-SPA-901 <break/>RRID:<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://scicrunch.org/resolver/AB_10616511">AB_10616511</ext-link></td><td valign="top">WB: 1:1000</td></tr></tbody></table></table-wrap><sec id="s4-1"><title>Amyloid beta peptide preparations</title><p>The amyloid beta 1–42 peptides and the respective control peptides (having the reverse aa sequence compared to 1–42 peptides) were synthesized by Sigma Aldrich’s custom synthesis service using the following sequences: DAEFRHDSGYEVHHQKLVFFAEDVGSNKGAIIGLMVGGVVIA (peptide 1-42) and AIVVGGVMLGIIAGKNSGVDEAFFVLKQHHVEYGSDHRFEAD (Reverse).

During the hippocampal RNA extractions, the RNA of one of the three 3-month-old wild-type mice had very low RIN scores, which could be a confounding factor for the short-RNA-seq. As this happened some months after the hippocampal extractions, we did not have available other 3-month mice of the same cohort used in our previous study of these mice for the behavioral and IHC studies. Thus, we decided to include only two replicates in this condition. Since the results presented in the current study involve mainly 6-month-old mice we expect the impact to be minimal.</p></sec><sec id="s4-3"><title>Cell culture and transfections</title><p>HT22 cells, from an immortalized mouse hippocampal cell line (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Davis and Maher, 1994</xref>) (Millipore Cat# SCC129, RRID:<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://scicrunch.org/resolver/CVCL_0321">CVCL_0321</ext-link>). Cells were provided by the vendor tested negative for infectious diseases by a Mouse Essential CLEAR panel by Charles River Animal Diagnostic Services and verified to be of mouse origin and negative for inter-species contamination from rat, chinese hamster, Golden Syrian hamster, human, and non-human primate (NHP) (as assessed by a Contamination Clear panel by Charles River Animal Diagnostic Services) as well as negative for mycoplasma contamination. Cells were cultured in DMEM (Sigma) and 1% Penicillin/Streptomycin (Gibco). Cells were thawed and passaged at least 3 days before the transfection date in order to allow sufficient time for cells to recover from the stress of cryopreservation and not interfere with the assessment of cellular response to stress in subsequent experiments.

Nucleotides were ordered from Sigma Aldrich as DMT phosphoramidites. The day of LNA transfections, following 5-min incubation with TrypLE Express Enzyme (Gibco) (1x), cells were passaged and transferred to a six-well plate at a 100,000 cells/well density and LNA transfections were performed simultaneously, using the HiPerfect reagent (Qiagen). Transfection was performed as follows: Firstly, LNAs were reconstituted in nuclease-free water to 50 μM. Subsequently, 3 μL 50 µM LNA were mixed and incubated with 4 µL Hiperfect reagent and 30 µL nuclease-free water, at room temperature for 20 min, and then added drop-wise to cells that had just been plated in 1 ml of medium/well (still not attached) to a final LNA concentration of 150 nM. For anti-<italic>Hsf1</italic> LNAs transfections, incubation with amyloid beta (peptide 1-42) and control peptides (Reverse) was performed 24 hr after transfection with LNAs. Peptides were initially dissolved in DMSO for incubation at 37°C for 1 hr and then added to cells to a final concentration of 30 µM for 6 hr before treating with 0.5 mL TrypLE (Gibco), pelleting cells at 1000 rpm for 5 min and resuspending the pellet in 1 mL Trizol reagent (Thermofisher) for RNA extraction based on Manufacturer’s instructions.

In brief, in vitro-transcribed B2 RNA was folded with 300 mM NaCl through incubation for 1 min at 50°C and cooling at a rate of 1°C/10 s until 4°C. Subsequently, B2 RNAs were incubated at a final concentration of 0.4 µM unless otherwise stated with the addition of Hsf1 diluted in TAP buffer (final reaction concentrations: 5 nM Tris pH 7.9, 0.5 mM MgCl<sub>2</sub>, 0.02 mM EDTA, 0.01% NP-40, 1% glycerol, 0.2 mM DTT). Hsf1 protein incubations were performed with phosphorylated, recombinant, His-tagged Hsf1 (Enzo Life Sciences: ADI-SPP-902-F; ~60KDa). Hsf1 working concentrations were 250 nM unless otherwise specified, diluted in TAP buffer. PNK (NEB, M0201; ~35KDa) was used as a control protein because it is an RNA-binding protein that is used in the construction of our short RNA libraries and we wanted show that short RNA seq data are free of such confounding factors that could potentially generate artificial fragments. PolyA (NEB, M0276; ~56KDa) was used as control protein because it is an RNA-binding protein that should not process B2 RNAs. Denatured Hsf1 was prepared by diluting in TAP buffer as above and heating at 95°C for 3 min; denatured Hsf1 was used as a control to ensure buffer components of Hsf1 themselves were not responsible for B2 RNA processing.</p><p>Fragmentation of B2 RNA was analyzed on 8M urea 10% PAGE gels stained by SYBR II (Invitrogen, S7564).

In brief, following addition of the lysis/binding buffer and the homogenate additive solution to the RNA, 1/3 of the volume 100% EtOH was added and the mix was passed through the column for binding long RNAs. 100% EtOH at 2/3 of the flow through volume was subsequently added to the flow through and passed through a second column for binding short RNAs. Eluted RNAs were tested for size and quality using the Agilent Bioanalyzer RNA pico-kit. For long-RNA-seq, the long RNA fractions were cleaned and concentrated using the RNeasy Minelute kit (Qiagen) and ribodepleted using the rRNA depletion kit (NEB).

For short-RNA-seq, the short RNA fractions were subjected to 3′-phosphoryl removal for 1 hr at 37°C, treated with the T4 PNK enzyme (NEB, M0201), using exclusively the 10X PNK buffer (NEB).

In brief, the script constructs a read accumulation metagene model around a hypothetical set of genomic points, in our case the start site for all B2 elements (TSS), in which the numbers of reads (or read 5' ends) around each different TSS were calculated and attributed to defined points in the model. B2 element coordinates are based on the UCSC genome browser RepeatMasker track (as of November 2018). To calculate the B2 processing ratio, Babraham NGS analysis suite Seqmonk 1.38.2 (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://www.bioinformatics.babraham.ac.uk/projects/seqmonk/">https://www.bioinformatics.babraham.ac.uk/projects/seqmonk/</ext-link>) was used to obtain number of long reads overlapping with B2 loci (B2_Mm1a, B2_Mm1t and B2_Mm2), as well as the number of reads overlapping with tRNA loci from −5 to 15 bp. Processing ratio for each sample was calculated by processed B2 count obtained from the in house python scripts normalized by tRNA from −5 to 15 bp and small reads fastq read count, as well as B2 count and long reads fastq read count: [Small fragments (position 95–110)/ [tRNAs/small RNA fastq]]/[B2RNA/long RNA fastq]. The full length of B2 consensus sequence is 188nt, and this is the one we use for the in vitro experiments. However, structure of the RNA has been resolved only for the 155nt (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Espinoza et al., 2007</xref>), and this is the structure currently used in our figures. For the mapping of short fragments, we have used the same range tested in our previous study (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib47">Zovoilis et al., 2016</xref>) to maintain consistency of the results. The reason why this 120nt threshold was selected in the Cell paper was to exclude artifacts from short RNAs mapping partially in our metagene as well as downstream of those B2 elements that are shorter from the consensus sequence.</p><p>In long-RNA-seq, FPKM (Fragments Per Kilobase of transcript per Million) and TPM (Transcripts Per Million) for genes were generated using StringTie-1.3.4d (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">Pertea et al., 2015</xref>) with the following annotation: ensembl GRCm38 patch 94 gff3 file, and parameters limiting the processing of read alignments to only estimate and output the assembled transcripts matching the reference transcripts given in annotation and excluding non-regular chromosomes. Because TPM already includes scaling of the data it is unsuitable for the averaging of the gene expression levels of multiple genes (B2-SRGs) used in the boxplots of <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2</xref>.

supporting the discovery that amyloid beta neuropathology involves deregulation of SINE B2 ncRNAs. The burden of Alzheimer's disease continues to increase, and novel insights into the mechanisms by which the pathogenic amyloid peptide exerts its toxic effects on neuronal tissues are appreciated and necessary. This manuscript reveals a previously unreported phenomenon elicited by the amyloid peptide leading to activation of cell death pathways, which supported by results from animal models and in vitro cell cultures.</p><p><bold>Decision letter after peer review:</bold></p><p>Thank you for submitting your article &quot;Increased processing of SINE B2 non coding RNAs unveils a novel type of transcriptome de-regulation underlying amyloid beta neuro-pathology&quot; for consideration by <italic>eLife</italic>. Your article has been reviewed by two peer reviewers at Review Commons, and the evaluation has been overseen by a Reviewing Editor and James Manley as the Senior Editor.</p><p>The reviewers have discussed the reviews with one another and the Reviewing Editor has drafted this decision to help you prepare a revised submission.</p><p>After thorough discussion, the reviewers agreed that the manuscript by Zovoilis et al. is much improved from the original submission to Review Commons and that the authors have addressed many of the original concerns raised by reviewers. However, two major concerns remain, and reviewers agreed to encourage a resubmission addressing these.</p><p>B2 RNAs encoded from SINE B2 elements have been directly implicated in stress response by its inherent ability to bind RNA Pol II and suppress stress response genes (SRG) in homeostatic conditions. However, upon stimuli, B2 RNAs are cleaved and degraded, resulting in the release of RNA polymerase II (RNAPII) and upregulation of SRGs. Previous work from the senior author of this manuscript identified the Polycomb repressive complex 2 (PRC2) component EZH2 to be the B2 RNA processing factor, cleaving B2 and releasing RNAPII. SRGs are upregulated upon stress, for example in age associated neuropathologies like Alzheimer's disease (AD). Considering that hippocampus is a primary target of amyloid pathologies and given that SRGs are suggested to be key for the function of a healthy hippocampus, the authors set out to understand the role of B2 RNAs that are linked to SRG regulation in the mouse hippocampus with amyloid pathology. They use disease relevant in vivo and in vitro models combined with unbiased RNA seq data analysis for this endeavor, which indicate the potential relevance of B2 RNAs in APP-mediated neuronal pathologies in mice while also identifying Hsf1 as the factor cleaving B2 RNAs in the hippocampus. The work is deemed interesting and identification of Hsf1 as the processing factor for B2 RNAs in the hippocampus is significant.</p><p>1) Reviewers remain concerned that the bulk of the analyses relies on genes that were identified as B2-regulated SRGs in a prior experimental system (heat-shocked NIH3T3 cells) that is completely different from the amyloid pathology models used here. The authors sought to address this issue in the revised manuscript, but questions remain. Indeed, the new Supplementary tables 4 and 5 in Supplementary file 1 show that of the ~1600 B2-SRGs identified in NIH3T3 cells, only 72 show expression patterns consistent with the regulatory model proposed; moreover, this was using FDR&lt;0.2. How many genes would be left with FDR&lt;0.05? The authors did include important new data in the HT22 cell model showing that mRNA levels for four genes increase after treatment with a B2-targeted LNA. These data are compelling, but a few additional controls are needed. Figure 6F needs negative controls showing qRT-PCR of genes that are not thought to be B2-SRGs. In Figure 6E, it is important that the full length B2 RNA is being detected (i.e. a PCR product ~180 nt) since their model states that these genes are repressed by full length B2 RNA prior to its degradation. The data in Figure 6 support the model that these four genes are under B2 control, but they don't show the relationship with amyloid pathology. What do the expression patterns of the 4 genes in Figure 6F look like in the mouse RNA-seq data (3m, 6m, 12m, WT vs APP)? Does the amyloid beta peptide treatment of the HT22 cells no longer induce expression of these four genes in the presence of the B2 LNA?</p><p>2) Reviewers remain concerned about the strength of the data regarding the role of Hsf1 in B2 RNA processing (although it seems like the authors are currently working on important control experiments, which might alleviate reviewer's concerns.) The negative controls with recombinant proteins prepared similarly to Hsf1, and with similarly sized control RNAs are critical. In addition, the full gels for these experiments need to be shown so the formation of short B2 RNA products can be evaluated in conjunction with the loss of the full length B2 RNA. This will help distinguish between specific processing controlled by the B2 ribozyme/Hsf1 activity versus non-specific breakdown. Moreover, the sizes of the in vitro processed products should correlate with the 5' end peaks from Figure 3A if the cellular and in vitro processing indeed arises from the same mechanism.</p></body></sub-article><sub-article article-type="reply" id="sa2"><front-stub><article-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.61265.sa2</article-id><title-group><article-title>Author response</article-title></title-group></front-stub><body><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Reviewer 1:</p><p>Reviewer #1 (Evidence, reproducibility and clarity Required):</p><p>B2 RNAs, encoded from SINE B2 elements has been directly implicated in stress response by its inherent ability to bind RNA Pol II and suppress stress response genes (SRG) in homeostatic conditions.

Indeed, we agree that provision of additional data and details is needed to avoid any confusion about the gene pathways to which our findings apply. In the initial manuscript, (Figures 2 D, F and 6 D, F), we presented the gene expression levels of all B2 RNA regulated SRGs identified in our previous study (Zovoilis et al., 2016), referred as B2 RNA regulated SRGs or B2-SRGs throughout the manuscript. To this end, we performed the respective statistical tests between the different conditions considering these genes, in order to show the transcription dynamics of these genes in either amyloid beta pathology (APP mice /Figures 2D, F) or amyloid beta toxicity (HT22 cells / Figures 6D, F). Since we were not looking for new candidate genes upregulated in APP mice or in our HT22 cell culture system, we did not narrow our analysis only to genes delivered by a general-purpose differential gene expression approach such as DESeq but tested all B2-SRGs. However, based on the reviewer’s comments below, we realize that the paper would benefit by presenting in the main figures only those B2 RNA regulated SRGs that overlap with differentially expressed genes identified by DEseq in each experimental system. This will help to avoid confusion and any misunderstanding that all B2 RNA regulated genes are equally affected in our system, which is not the case and would be an overstatement. We are now presenting in new Figure 2 (2E, 2F) only those B2-SRGs that overlap with upregulated genes identified by DESeq in 6m old APP mice (listed in new Supplementary table 5 in Supplementary file 1) and in new Figure 7 (7D, F) we are now presenting only those B2-SRGs that overlap with upregulated genes identified by DESeq in HT22 cells treated with amyloid beta (listed in new Supplementary table 11 in Supplementary file 1). The conclusions drawn by the new figures remain the same as with the old ones and we believe that this new way of presentation of this data will prevent confusion and potential over-statements. We thank the reviewer for bringing this to our attention. Based also on this reviewer’s minor point 3, we recommend that the old figures that included all B2-SRGs (and not only the differentially expressed ones identified by DESeq) are moved to the Supplement as new Figure 2—figure supplement 3 and Figure 8—figure supplement 2, respectively, so that readers can still get a view of all the data and the transcription dynamics of all B2-SRGs, while we provide both in text and the supplement an explanation about the value as well as limitations of these figures.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Major comments:</p><p>1) In Figure 1, the authors indicate a strong connection between B2 RNA regulated SRGs and learning and memory. In Figure 2, they identify the SRGs in the hippocampus, please provide a direct comparison of learning and memory associated SRGs and the SRGs they identify in Figure 2 that are significantly upregulated in APP mice in 6 months.</p></disp-quote><p>In the revised version of the manuscript we now provide:</p><p>i) As a new figure panel (lower panel in new Figure 1E), the number of B2 RNA regulated SRGs that are associated with learning based on our Peleg et al., 2010 paper and as a new Supplementary table 3 in Supplementary file 1, the exact list of these genes.</p><p>ii) As a new Supplementary table 4 in Supplementary file 1, the list of all genes that are significantly upregulated in APP mice (6 months).</p><p>iii) As a new Supplementary table 5 in Supplementary file 1, the list of those genes upregulated in amyloid pathology (APP 6 months) that are B2-SRGs (expression levels of these genes are presented in new Figure 2E,F).</p><p>Per reviewer’s question, we now provide as a new Supplementary table 6 in Supplementary file 1, the list of B2 RNA regulated SRGs that are both learning associated genes and upregulated in 6 month old APP mice. In the text (first two sections of the Results), we provide direct comparisons of the number of genes in each category and their overlap.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>2) To better understand the data in the context of hippocampal function, please include functional annotation of SRGs they identified in Figure 2F as they do it in Figure 1 (desirably for each time point, at least for 6M). How many of the SRGs they identify in Figure 1 are part of Figure 2F? Please include functional annotation of significantly upregulated B2 regulated SRGs in Figure 2 and compare them with that of Figure 1.</p></disp-quote><p>The number of B2 RNA regulated SRGs in Figure 1 that are part of Figure 2 (in particular Figures 2E,F) is now presented in the new Supplementary table 5 in Supplementary file 1 and also in the text. We now provide as a new Supplementary table 7 in Supplementary file 1 the functional annotation of these genes (see also general comment for this reviewer) and discuss the findings in the text.</p><p>We recommend to include only the 6M old mice as this is the time point in which B2 RNA processing was found to differ between WT and APP mice. However, if the reviewer thinks that this is necessary we will add also differential expression lists of other ages as additional supplementary tables.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>3) In Figure 3, the authors report that the B2 processing rates are high at the 6M time point at in hippocampi of the APP mice. Please include the levels of unprocessed and processed B2 RNAs in these samples along with this figure, without which it is difficult to gauge the significance of its correlation with SRGs in Figure 2.</p></disp-quote><p>We now provide as new figure panels 3E and 3F the levels of processed B2 RNA fragments and unprocessed (full length) B2 RNAs in these samples, respectively, along with the processing ratio which is now labeled as subfigure 3G.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>4) What is the % of B2 regulated SRGs that are hsf1 bound in Figure 4C? What is there dynamics in the wild type and APP hippocampi?</p></disp-quote><p>Old Figure 4C is now Figure 4A. The exact number of B2 RNA regulated SRGs that are close to Hsf1 binding sites is now presented as a new figure (Figure 4C) and discussed in the text. A list of these genes is provided as new Supplementary table 8 in Supplementary file 1. For genes that are upregulated in APP mice compared to wild type, the difference in Hsf1 binding dynamics between B2 RNA regulated and not regulated genes is now presented as Figure 4—figure supplement 1.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>5) What is the distribution of Hsf1 binding sites on (a) non-B2 regulated SRGs and (b) non-SRG genes in hippocampi?</p></disp-quote><p>This point is related with point 4. We now present a new panel (Figure 4B) for non B2 RNA regulated genes (listed in Supplementary table 13 in Supplementary file 1) along with the distribution we have in the initial manuscript for all B2 RNA regulated SRGs (now presented as Figure 4A). The direct comparison of these genes is presented in the new Figure 4—figure supplement 1 together with a similar comparison only for genes upregulated in APP mice.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>6) In Figure 4D, the 3months old Wt HSF1 levels are high, yet B2 processing (Figure 3E) is low. Please comment.</p></disp-quote><p>The reviewer’s comment made us realize that we should include a plot that describes the correlation between Hsf1 levels and B2 RNA processing ration across all sequenced samples. This should reveal whether differences such as those observed by the reviewer affect our conclusion regarding the relationship between these two parameters. We now provide this in the new Figure 8—figure supplement 1, where we found a strong positive correlation between Hsf1 levels and B2 RNA processing ratio. We thank the reviewer for this comment which helped us to substantiate further this relationship.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>7) While the authors show in vitro cleavage of B2 RNA by Hsf1, the experiment lacks controls to be conclusive. At least, please include a similar size protein as HSF1 with no-known RNA binding activity and a similar size protein with RNA binding activity as controls in 5A. Please justify the use of PNK as the control protein. Please include the use domain-based deletions of Hsf1 to map the region of HSF1 that is binding and potentially cleaving the B2 RNA. Please include an RNA of similar size and Antisense-B2 RNA to show the specificity of the Hsf1 based cleavage of B2 RNA. Without these controls, the conclusions in Figure 5 cannot be substantiated.</p></disp-quote><p>The endogenous ribozyme activity of B2 RNA compared to other control RNAs has already been shown in two previous works but we will also include the relative controls here by providing control incubations with other RNAs. We will also include the incubations with additional control proteins as suggested by the reviewer. We are currently performing these experiments and will include them in the revised version. PNK is used as a control protein because it is an RNA binding protein that is used in the construction of our short RNA libraries and we wanted show that short RNA seq data are free of such confounding factors that could potentially generate artificial fragments. We now include this information in the text.</p><p>We feel that the application of domain based deletions for Hsf1, while it would add additional information on the exact biochemistry underlying B2 RNA processing though Hsf1, is beyond the scope of this manuscript. In the current manuscript we are just focusing on the fact that Hsf1 can accelerate B2 RNA processing in vitro and not on the mechanism how this happens. This should be addressed in our opinion on a separate manuscript.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>8) The authors should show that the incubated APP peptides are taken up by the cells (experiments in Figure 5F and Figure 6).</p></disp-quote><p>These figures are now labelled as Figure 6C and Figure 7, respectively.</p><p>That’s a very interesting point and we thank the reviewer for this comment. Multiple studies have shown that toxicity after incubation by amyloid beta is mediated mainly by cell surface receptors, which through cell signalling leads to the response to cellular toxicity that induces stress genes such as Hsf1.</p><p>Nevertheless, APP peptides may enter the cell, and the reviewer’s questions raised the possibility that oligomers entering the cell could have a direct impact on the stability of the B2 RNA. In that case, providing evidence that the amyloid enters the cell would be important if we had indications that amyloid beta interacts directly with B2 RNA. We did test this and we found no direct effect of amyloid beta on B2 RNA, so the processing in our case is not induced by oligomers that may have entered the cell. We were planning to present this information in a different manuscript, but if the reviewer or editor thinks that it would be beneficial for the paper, we could present this as supplement figure that shows that amyloid beta incubations with B2 RNA do not induce further processing beyond what Hsf1 causes. For the moment we just present this in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="respfig1">Author response image 1</xref>:</p><fig id="respfig1"><label>Author response image 1.</label><graphic mime-subtype="tiff" mimetype="image" xlink:href="elife-61265-resp-fig1-v2.tif"/></fig><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>9) Please provide the list, functional annotation, and % of the SRGs upregulated upon incubation with APP in HT22 cells in comparison to 6month old APP mice.

Please comment.</p></disp-quote><p>We assume that the reviewer here refers to the lack of reduction in Hsf1 levels in the cells inoculated with the reverse peptide and the anti-Hsf1 LNA. Indeed, this lack of reduction is confirmed also by the new qPCR we performed (new Figure 7B, lower panel, R-ctrl vs R-anti-Hsf1). This should likely be attributed to compensation during non-stress conditions. In contrast, under stress conditions, Hsf1 is heavily used in stress response, which could explain the differences we see as cellular needs surpass the available Hsf1 transcripts due to degradation by the LNA. This is also supported by the new RT-qPCR experiments we have performed for B2-SRGs (new Figure 7E). In agreement with what is known for stress response genes such as immediately early genes (for example FosB), levels of these genes are minimal in both Rctrl and R-anti-Hsf1 conditions and only become activated during stress response. We now discuss this in the text of the revised manuscript.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>13) Please compare and contrast the % of genes, the overlap, and the functional distinctions in 6F to that of 5G and Figure 1. What are the genes that are common between Figure 1, and that are specifically upregulated upon Anti-Hsf1 LNA transfection along with 1-42 APP. What is % of the occurrence of B2 binding sites in those genes? What are their functional annotations and what is their connection to learning, memory, and cell survival?</p></disp-quote><p>Old Figure 6F is now Figure 7F, while old Figure 5G is now Figure 6C.</p><p>This point is discussed in the response to points 1 and 9 of this reviewer. In summary, genes upregulated in our amyloid toxicity model included 25 B2-SRGs (new Supplementary table 11). When testing for enriched terms in these 25 genes, biological processes related with apoptosis, such as regulation of apoptotic process and programmed cell death were at the top of the list (new Supplementary table 12) and included, among others, genes such as FosB and Mitf that have been connected with Alzheimer’s disease. Out of the 25 genes that are up-regulated in both mice and our cell culture system, six are B2-SRGs (4932438A13Rik, Fosb, Pag1, Ptprs, Sema5a, and Sgms1) and include a well-known immediate early gene (Fosb), genes associated with sensitivity to amyloid toxicity (Pag1, Sema5a, Sgms1, Fosb), as well as genes associated with p53 (Ptprs, Fosb). All these genes get upregulated in amyloid toxicity (42-Ctrl vs R-Ctrl) but are not upregulated when Hsf1 LNA is applied (42-anti-Hsf1 vs R-anti-Hsf1, no significant difference).

However, upon stimuli, B2 RNAs are cleaved and degraded, resulting in the release of RNA pol II and upregulation of SRGs. Previous work from the senior author identified PRC2 component EZH2 to be the B2 RNA processing factor, cleaving B2, and releasing POL2. SRGs are upregulated upon stress, for example in age-associated neuropathologies like Alzheimer's disease (AD). Considering that the hippocampus is a primary target of amyloid pathologies as well as since SRGs are suggested to be key for the function of a healthy hippocampus, the authors set to understand the role of B2 RNAs that are linked to SRG regulation in the mouse hippocampus with amyloid pathology. They use disease-relevant in vivo and in vitro models combined with unbiased RNA seq data analysis for this endeavor, which indicates the potential relevance of B2 RNAs in APP mediated neuronal pathologies in mice as well as identifies Hsf1 as the factor cleaving B2 RNAs in the hippocampus.</p><p>The work is interesting and identification of Hsf1 as the processing factor for B2 RNAs in the hippocampus is significant. I would like to credit the authors for their elegant in vivo experimental design in Figure 2.</p><p>Reviewer 2:</p><p>Reviewer #2 (Evidence, reproducibility and clarity Required):</p><p>Summary:</p><p>This manuscript follows from previous work by the corresponding author showing that SINE-encoded B2 RNAs function as regulators of the expression of stress response genes (SRGs). Specifically, stimulus triggers the processing of repressive B2 RNAs that are bound at the SRGs, thereby activating SRG transcription. In this work, the authors investigate whether a similar mechanism might be controlling the expression of genes in models of amyloid beta neuropathology (i.e. mouse hippocampi from an amyloid precursor protein knock-in mouse model, and a cell culture model of amyloid beta toxicity). They performed RNA-seq in these models. Their data show a correlation between the progression of amyloid pathology, expression of genes thought to be regulated by B2 RNA, and the processing of B2 RNA. In addition, they show biochemical data supporting a role for Hsf1 in enhancing the processing of B2 RNA. Knockdown of Hsf1 also reduced B2 RNA processing and the expression of SRGs.</p><p>Major comments:</p><p>1) In the RNA-seq data one cannot distinguish between Pol III transcribed B2 RNA and Pol II transcribed B2 RNA (typically embedded within introns and UTRs of mRNAs). The models they present, and the structures they show, clearly imply regulation by Pol III transcribed B2 RNA. However, there is no way to know that the short B2 RNAs they sequence aren't coming from degraded mRNAs. This needs to addressed. Minimally, in writing as a caveat of their model. Ideally, it would be addressed experimentally.</p></disp-quote><p>That’s a very interesting point, as it implies that the regulatory role of B2 RNAs may extend from PolIII transcribed B2 RNAs into B2 RNAs embedded into mRNAs (likely nascent ones) that may be also under the same endogenous ribozyme activity of this sequence, suppress PolII and are processed in response to stimuli. The RNA RIN values of our samples were pretty high except one 3m old mouse sample which was for this reason excluded from further analysis. Moreover, during the library construction shorter and longer RNAs have been separated. Thus, any generation of B2 RNA fragment that may have originated from mRNA should be biologically but not technically related and must have happened in the cell before our RNA extraction. To address this point, we now provide a new supplementary figure (Figure 3—figure supplement 2), where we have separated the B2 elements against which we map the RNA fragments into two categories, those that fall within exonic/genic regions and those outside of these regions. Although B2 RNAs are produced by multiple copies in the genome, each copy does harbor multiple SNPs, insertions and deletions, which means that each B2 RNA fragment is mapped to a specific set of B2 elements and not to all of them. In other words, despite multiple mapping a level of spatial specificity is maintained. If the B2 RNAs we map were coming exclusively from either only Pol III B2 elements or mRNA embedded B2 elements, we would expect at least some difference in the distribution of fragments between B2 elements of these two categories, as the second one overlaps with mRNAs. As shown in the new figure 3—figure supplement 2, the fact that distribution models are very similar between the two categories indeed supports the hypothesis that both types of B2 elements may contribute to B2 RNA processing. Most importantly, the profile of B2 RNAs in genic regions shows that B2 RNA processing is not random but follows the same processing rules as B2 RNAs from Pol III promoters. Given the limitations posed by the repetitive nature of B2 RNAs, it remains difficult though to provide an exact number regarding the portion of B2 RNA fragments produced by each category and this is clearly noted in our revised discussion part. However, even the indication that B2 RNAs embedded in mRNAs may also play an important role in our model provides a new perspective that should be investigated further in future studies.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>2) The direct regulation of SRGs by B2 RNA was not shown in their model systems for amyloid beta neuropathology. Rather, the authors' used the genes identified in their prior studies as B2 RNA-regulated, which I believe were in the NIH3T3 cell line. Given that transcription is highly cell-type specific, these genes might not be regulated by B2 RNA in mouse hippocampi or their cell culture model, despite the correlations shown. This needs to be addressed. Ideally, a targeted approach to show that transcription of even a couple genes in their system is indeed regulated by B2 RNA would provide stronger support for their conclusions.</p></disp-quote><p>We agree with the reviewer and we now provide a new figure (Figure 6D-F) with the targeted approach that this reviewer proposed. In particular, we have tested whether fragmentation of full length B2 RNAs is in connection with activation of target genes also in our biological system (HT22 cells) as it did in NIH/3T3 cells in our Cell paper. We now show in new Figure 6 that this is indeed the case.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>3) The following bioinformatics analyses would strengthen their conclusions. This should be straightforward to do because it involves data they already have, and perhaps analyses they have already have performed.</p><p>a) Regarding the plot in Figure 3A (lower panel). The same plot should be shown for the 3m old and the 12m old APP mice (i.e. not just the 6m data). This would show the specificity of processing B2 RNA and that it indeed correlates with disease progression.</p></disp-quote><p>We now provide this plot as new supplementary figure (Figure 3—figure supplement 1). It shows that increased B2 RNA processing coincides only with the active neurodegeneration phase at 6 months and not the terminal stage.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>b) Regarding the plots of B2 RNA processing rate. This value could increase either due to more short RNAs or less full length RNA. Which is it for the 3m, 6m, and 12m APP mice? Showing the short and long B2 RNAs as boxplots (as opposed to only the processing rate) would address this and also provide additional insight into the regulation involved. The same applies to the data in Figure 6. (As an aside… do the authors mean processing ratio as opposed to rate? I'm not clear where the time component is coming into play to call this a rate.)</p></disp-quote><p>Old Figure 6 is now Figure 7.</p><p>We now provide all these figures that show that increase in processing ratio at 6 months is mainly due to increase in the processed fragments and not a decrease in full length B2 RNAs. For APP mice these are new Figures 3E and F, and for HT22 cells , these are new Figure 8—figure supplement 1B and C.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>c) The random genes in Figures 2E and 6E are plotted as heat maps, but statistical significance is hard to see. What do boxplots of the random genes look like, and is the significant difference between 6m old APP and 6m old WT then lost?</p></disp-quote><p>Old Figure 2E is now new Figure 2—figure supplement 3C, while old Figure 6E is now new Figure 8—figure supplement 2C. We now provide these boxplots in new Figure 2—figure supplement 3B and Figure 8—figure supplement 2B.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>4) It is interesting that B2 RNA self-processing is enhanced by both Ezh2 and also Hsf1. It would strengthen the data to perform a control with a protein prepared more similarly to the Hsf1 (rather than PNK) to confirm that the enhanced B2 RNA breakdown is indeed attributable to Hsf1 and not a contaminant in the protein prep. Similarly, the authors should provide information on which RNA was added as the negative control for Hsf1-stimulated breakdown (i.e. the ~80 nt RNA).</p></disp-quote><p>This point is also discussed in reviewer 1 point 7. The ribozyme endogenous activity of B2 RNA has been shown already in two previous studies that performed incubations with control RNAs and proteins. We are currently preparing and will provide these additional incubations as anew supplementary figure in the revised manuscript.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Minor comments:</p><p>1) Regarding the GO analyses in Figure 1 (panels B, C, and D). I wasn't clear whether the authors are showing all statistically enriched terms, or only those relevant to neuronal processes and learning. I recommend showing a supplemental table with all terms that have an adjusted p value below a specified cut-off (e.g. 0.05).</p></disp-quote><p>The statistical threshold used was an EASE score of 0.05 and all presented terms were above this threshold. In the initial manuscript we filtered only the top 5 terms in tissue enrichment and the top 10 terms for GO Biol process and Cell Compartment that had passed the threshold. We now provide all the terms that passed the threshold as a new Supplementary table 2 in Supplementary file 1, including gene counts, exact gene numbers and related statistics.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>2) The authors show several figures that are not new data (2B, 4A, 4B, Supplementary figures 1 and 2). I think it would be more clear if these data were summarized and referenced in the Results, rather than shown.</p></disp-quote><p>Old Supplementary figures 1 and 2 that were results of previous studies or web resources directly available (such as Human Protein Atlas) have been now removed and they are now just referenced in the text. Old Figures 4A and 4B have been removed from the main figures but may be helpful to the readers if they are still available in the Supplement (currently as Figure 4—figure supplement 1A and B), as not all users are familiar with the RNA-seq browsing tools of Allen Brain Atlas resources.</p><p>Regarding Figure 2B that contains data from our previous study on this exact cohort of mice: If the reviewer and the editor agree we recommend that it remains in the main figure (with the appropriate image credit citations), as it provides in an efficient way the clear connection between amyloid load and our results at the molecular level, and, most importantly, it clearly draws a line in amyloid pathology progression between 3m old and 6m old, that agrees with our findings in the RNA-seq data of these mice.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>3) In Figure 3A the schematic shows that B2 is 155 nt, the plots in Figures 3A,B,C show B2 RNA is 120 nt, and Figure 5 shows the RNA is 188 nt. Can the authors please clarify these differences?</p></disp-quote><p>The full length of B2 consensus sequence is 188nt and this is the one we use for the in vitro experiments. However, the structure of the B2 RNA has been resolved only for the first 155nt by the Kugel lab, and this is the only publicly available structure that we can reference in our figures.</p><p>For the mapping of 5’ends of short fragments in Figure 3A we have used the same range tested in our Cell paper to maintain consistency of the results. The reason why this 120nt threshold was selected in the Cell paper was to exclude artifacts from short RNAs mapping partially in our metagene as well as downstream of those B2 elements that are shorter from the consensus sequence. We now explain in Materials and methods section these differences.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>4) In the Materials and methods section, the sequence of the g block template didn't contain the T7 promoter sequence that was used as the forward primer for PCR amplification?</p></disp-quote><p>We have now included this sequence in lower case.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>5) In Figure 6B, why were Hsf1 levels not decreased in the R treated cells after treatment with the LNA?</p></disp-quote><p>Old Figure 6B is now new Figure 7B.</p><p>Please see response to reviewer 1, major point 12.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Reviewer #2 (Significance (Required)):</p><p>The models presented for the regulation of stress response genes (SRGs) in amyloid beta neuropathologies are compelling. As are the correlations they found between the progression of amyloid pathology, expression of genes thought to be regulated by B2 RNA, and the processing of B2 RNA.

Most prior studies in this area use common model cell lines, and this lab seems well-positioned to unravel the proposed molecular mechanisms in neuronal systems.</p></disp-quote><p>We appreciate the encouraging comments made by this reviewer.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Reviewer 3:</p><p>Reviewer #3 (Evidence, reproducibility and clarity (Required)):</p><p>This manuscript describes a regulatory mechanism involving Hsf1 and B2 RNAs in the control of stress response genes (SRGs) during amyloid induced toxicity. In particular Hsf1, upregulated in 6m old APP mice and in HT22 cells treated with beta amyloid peptides, is shown to stimulate the B2 RNA destabilization leading to SRGs activation. While in healthy cells this upregulation can be reverted once the stimulus is removed, the pathological condition fuels the circuitry leading to p53 upregulation and neuronal cell death. The authors previously described the same mechanism acting during cellular heath shock response but in this case the protein identified as trigger of B2 RNA destabilization and SRGs activation was EZH2 (Zovoilis et al., 2016).</p><p>Indeed, the first part of the manuscript describes additional analyses of the previous data that prompts further investigation on the potential role of B2 RNA in AD condition. Nevertheless, it is not clear how the prior findings obtained in not biologically related cellular models might be used to obtain helpful indication of B2 RNA neuronal activity.</p></disp-quote><p>We thank the reviewer for this comment. Indeed, the current study’s main aim was to expand the findings of our previous work on the role of B2 RNA in cellular response to thermal stress in NIH/3T3 cells to other types of cellular response to stress, in our case to amyloid toxicity and the resulting amyloid pathology in neural cells. Response to thermal stress (Heat Shock) has been used for years as a basic study model for cellular response to stress. Proteins and gene pathways initially identified in heat shock have been subsequently shown to play identical pro-survival roles in other biological systems and there are studies showing the role of Hsf1, heat shock related proteins and cell stress response pathways in neural cells and the mammalian brain (we will provide these references in the revised version). For example, pathways such as the MAPK pathway and early response genes, that constitute the basis of response to heat shock, have been shown in studies by us and others to be activated and play a critical role in hippocampal function. Thus, examining the role of B2 RNA in the context of neural response to stress constituted a natural continuation of our previous study in NIH/3T3 cells. The fact that the list of B2 RNA regulated SRGs was found to be highly enriched in neuronal tissue terms and cellular compartments related to neuronal functions plainly confirms the close relationship among cellular response pathways in the two biological systems. Due to these facts we were compelled to investigate in more detail our previous findings also in a neural cell model. However, as discussed in point 2 of reviewer 2, the initial manuscript did not confirm the direct control of B2 RNA on expression of target genes also in our cellular model. This information is now part of the new Figure 6 and we thank both reviewers for bringing this to our attention.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>The research fields of non-coding RNAs and neurodegeneration are attractive and challenging and, in my opinion, the molecular circuitry involving B2 RNAs might add important insights for understanding beta amyloid toxicity and neuronal death; however, the data provided are not in the shape making the manuscript suitable for publication: some controls are missing, the way the experiments are presented is not easy to follow and more importantly the authors does not provide any data (tables or lists) of the NGS experiments and the study lacks validation of them. Therefore, in my opinion the manuscript needs a profound revision before to be considered for publication in Review Commons.</p></disp-quote><p>Based on this reviewer’s and the other reviewers’ suggestions we now provide additional controls, detailed tables and gene lists, and qPCR validation of these results. We have also substantially revised the text in the first section of the Results and beginning of the Discussion, to make our rational for testing B2SRGs more clear and easier to follow.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Major concerns:</p><p>1) The first paragraph of the Results is entirely dedicated to reanalyze the data previously published by the same group (Zovoilis et al., 2016). However, this is not adequately explained. In line with this, the Table 1 is not required since the data are already provided by Zovoilis et al., 2016, unless the authors handled the data using additional new criteria that have to be explained.</p></disp-quote><p>We now explain our rational for using this data in more detail in the text. Please see also response to the general comment of this reviewer and response to the next point.</p><p>In the Zovoilis et al., 2016, study, the data presented did not include the list of regulated genes in a direct way but as part of the annotation of the B2 CHART peaks. This may pose difficulty to non-experts to extract the gene list from that data and we thought to include them as separate gene list here so that readers can directly use it for their analysis. Nevertheless, if the reviewer or the editor think that the list is redundant, we can surely omit it.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Moreover, Zovoilis and colleagues (2016) focused on SRGs regulated upon heat shock and using NIH/3T3 and HeLa cell lines, therefore, it is difficult to me understand how, searching for &quot;cellular function connected with B2 RNA regulated SRGs&quot;, the list resulted enriched of neuronal tissue terms or cellular compartments related to neuronal functions. Please clarify this point since the following analyses are based on these findings.</p></disp-quote><p>Neural pathologies, such as amyloid pathology in brain, are often connected with cellular stress due to proteotoxicity. The ability of neural cells to respond to proteotoxicity challenges is connected with various molecular mechanisms, including stress related proteins that were firstly described in the context of heat shock. Thus, both contexts (heat shock and amyloid toxicity) refer to cellular response to stress, which explains why genes identified to be regulated during stress response in NIH/3T3 cells constitute part of the basic stress response toolbox that neural cells have also been described to possess. We have now modified the text accordingly to make our rational more clear.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>2) In Figure 1F there is no arrow indicating that some of the SRGs regulate directly miR-34 as stated in the main text. Moreover, it is more appropriate to replace SRGs with learning-associated genes both in the figure and in text (second paragraph of the Results) since Zovoilis and colleagues focused on them. Finally, they did not show in their manuscript the rescue of p53 expression mediated by mir-34; indeed, for miR-34-p53 regulatory axis Zovoilis and colleagues referred to Peleg et al., 2010 and Yamakuchi and Lowenstein, 2009. Please fix all these concerns.</p></disp-quote><p>We have restructured the figure as suggested by the reviewer and made clear the distinction between learning genes and B2 RNA regulated SRGs (B2-SRGs) from the two different studies.

The authors also conclude that the genes controlled by B2 RNAs may not overlap with the ones controlled by Hsf1 during H/S. The author should make a comment on this explaining why during H/S B2 RNAs work independently from Hsf1 and on different target SRGs while, during beta amyloid stress ,the two act together on the same SRGs. Moreover, as shown for EZH2, Hsf1-RIP experiment should be performed in order to confirm the direct involvement of Hsf1 in the SRGs-B2 destabilization.</p></disp-quote><p>In the last two paragraphs of our Discussion we indicate that B2 RNA regulation is a new process implicated in the response to stress in amyloid pathology but certainly not the only one.

However, two major concerns remain, and reviewers agreed to encourage a resubmission addressing these.</p><p>B2 RNAs encoded from SINE B2 elements have been directly implicated in stress response by its inherent ability to bind RNA Pol II and suppress stress response genes (SRG) in homeostatic conditions. However, upon stimuli, B2 RNAs are cleaved and degraded, resulting in the release of RNA polymerase II (RNAPII) and upregulation of SRGs. Previous work from the senior author of this manuscript identified the Polycomb repressive complex 2 (PRC2) component EZH2 to be the B2 RNA processing factor, cleaving B2 and releasing RNAPII. SRGs are upregulated upon stress, for example in age associated neuropathologies like Alzheimer's disease (AD). Considering that hippocampus is a primary target of amyloid pathologies and given that SRGs are suggested to be key for the function of a healthy hippocampus, the authors set out to understand the role of B2 RNAs that are linked to SRG regulation in the mouse hippocampus with amyloid pathology. They use disease relevant in vivo and in vitro models combined with unbiased RNA seq data analysis for this endeavor, which indicate the potential relevance of B2 RNAs in APP-mediated neuronal pathologies in mice while also identifying Hsf1 as the factor cleaving B2 RNAs in the hippocampus. The work is deemed interesting and identification of Hsf1 as the processing factor for B2 RNAs in the hippocampus is significant.</p><p>1) Reviewers remain concerned that the bulk of the analyses relies on genes that were identified as B2-regulated SRGs in a prior experimental system (heat-shocked NIH3T3 cells) that is completely different from the amyloid pathology models used here. The authors sought to address this issue in the revised manuscript, but questions remain. Indeed, the new Supplementary tables 4 and 5 in Supplementary file 1 show that of the ~1600 B2-SRGs identified in NIH3T3 cells, only 72 show expression patterns consistent with the regulatory model proposed; moreover, this was using FDR&lt;0.2. How many genes would be left with FDR&lt;0.05? The authors did include important new data in the HT22 cell model showing that mRNA levels for four genes increase after treatment with a B2-targeted LNA. These data are compelling, but a few additional controls are needed. Figure 6F needs negative controls showing qRT-PCR of genes that are not thought to be B2-SRGs. In Figure 6E, it is important that the full length B2 RNA is being detected (i.e. a PCR product ~180 nt) since their model states that these genes are repressed by full length B2 RNA prior to its degradation. The data in Figure 6 support the model that these four genes are under B2 control, but they don't show the relationship with amyloid pathology. What do the expression patterns of the 4 genes in Figure 6F look like in the mouse RNA-seq data (3m, 6m, 12m, WT vs APP)? Does the amyloid beta peptide treatment of the HT22 cells no longer induce expression of these four genes in the presence of the B2 LNA?</p></disp-quote><p>We thank the reviewers for this comment. We now provide more clarity and supporting data to address this comment. In particular:</p><p>a) Our model does not propose that all B2-SRGs are deregulated in APP mice or that all deregulated genes in APP mice are B2-SRGs. Instead, it shows that a subset of the B2 SRGs is deregulated in amyloid pathology. This may not have been clear in the model described in our initial manuscript (old Figure 8, now Figure 9), in which we have used the general term “Stress response genes” to describe genes under this regulatory mechanism. In the revised Figure 9 model we have now substituted this term with the more accurate term “Target genes” to prevent any confusion and denote that there may be a variety of B2 RNA-targeted genes in different biological contexts. Moreover, our current data addresses B2 RNA-mediated regulation only in the context of amyloid beta pathology and focuses on differentially expressed B2 SRGs based on a statistical modeling approach (DESeq2, a total of 72 genes). Beyond this set of differentially expressed genes, we searched for additional SRGs that are expressed in the hippocampus, yet, they may be associated with other hippocampal functions that are independent from amyloid beta pathology. The expression of hippocampal B2-SRGs would be expected to correlate with B2 RNA processing. As shown in the new Figure 8—figure supplement 1E and the respective table (new Supplementary table 12 in Supplementary file 1) a detailed breakdown of these B2-SRGs with regard to expression in hippocampal cells and correlation with B2 RNA processing reveals 659 B2-SRGs that are sufficiently expressed in our tested hippocampal samples and, of those, more than 63% shows a weak (11%) or strong (52%) correlation between expression levels and B2 RNA processing ratio. This data suggests that, for a large number of the B2-SRGs previously identified in the context of heat shock, correlation between gene expression and B2 RNA processing ratio holds true also in the context of hippocampal cells, independently of the presence of amyloid beta pathology.</p><p>b) By applying DESeq2 to statistically model the expression changes observed between 6m old WT and APP mice we obtained 72 B2-SRGs upregulated in 6m old APP mice (listed in Supplementary table 5 in Supplementary file 1). All of those B2-SRGs have a p-value &lt; 0.05, with 34 of them belonging to the group with an FDR value threshold below 5% and the rest 38 to the group with an FDR value at least below 20%. We used a more flexible FDR threshold since expression dynamics of the 72 differentially expressed genes (shown in Figure 2) show an almost identical pattern with those ones of several other B2-SRGs that may have been missed by the DESeq2 (shown in Figure 2—figure supplement 3). This strongly suggests that use of DESEq2 is rather conservative in our case for reasons listed in the respective note in the legend of Figure 2—figure supplement 3. In order to mitigate any concerns for an increased number of false positives in our data due to selection of a higher FDR threshold, in the new Figure 2—figure supplement 2, we now provide validation through RT-qPCR of the DESeq2 results. We have selected 12 of the differentially expressed genes (Figure 2—figure supplement 2A) and tested them through RT-qPCR (Figure 2—figure supplement 2B). The majority of the genes tested have been intentionally selected from the group with the higher FDR threshold (8 out of 12 have an FDR more than 5% and less than 20%). The resulting RT-qPCR data presented in Figure 2—figure supplement 2B are in alignment with the RNA-seq results for the same genes presented in Figure 2—figure supplement 2A. Thus, through the use of an orthogonal validation technique, the differentially expressed genes identified by DESeq2 in 6m APP mice indeed correspond to true positive findings. This data, together with data in Figure 2—figure supplement 3, support further that application of a standard RNA-seq differential expression statistical model such as DEseq2 in our case may indeed be a rather conservative approach. Nevertheless, given the widespread use of DESeq2, we still suggest the use of this approach in the main body of the study in order to facilitate comparison of our data with those from other groups in the future.</p><p>c) In order to substantiate further the connection between B2-SRGs previously identified in heat shocked NIH/3T3 cells and B2 RNA destabilization we have increased the number of B2-SRGs tested through RT-qPCR in the B2 KD assay in hippocampal cells (initially 4 genes, now 11 genes). In the new Figure 7C, we now show that, as previously observed in NIH/3T3 cells, also in hippocampal cells, destabilizing B2 RNA leads to increase in the expression of these genes. In addition to these 11 genes, we now include 5 negative controls (non-B2 SRGs) that showed no change during treatment. Among the negative controls we have also intentionally included non-B2-SRGs such as Adcyl1 and Kalrn, both of which are upregulated in amyloid beta pathology, to support further the specificity of our findings (i.e. being upregulated in amyloid beta pathology does not mean regulation by B2 RNA unless being a B2-SRG).</p><p>d) Indeed, in Figure 7A we test the unprocessed B2 RNA encompassing the full Pol II binding region (80-132) including all cutting points. The reverse primer is located downstream at position 142. Making a reverse primer beyond the position 142 is not possible as it overlaps with B2 RNAs poly-A repeats. The primers are now listed in the Materials and methods.</p><p>e) Data for the expression patterns of all genes in the new Figure 7C (old Figure 6F) that are differentially expressed in mouse APP and WT mice are now presented in Figure 2—figure supplement 2A for all three ages and conditions.</p><p>f) “<italic>Does the amyloid beta peptide treatment of the HT22 cells no longer induce expression of these four genes in the presence of the B2 LNA?”.</italic> To our understanding, we are asked whether treating the HT22 cells with amyloid beta and B2 LNA induces expression of these genes. Based on the data presented in the manuscript the amyloid beta treatment induces expression of these four genes (see new Figure 6D) as does the B2 LNA independently (Figure 7). Thus, we are a little unsure on the scope of such as experiment as we feel that inoculating B2 LNA together with amyloid beta would not add any additional information regarding our model. Such an experiment would have been informative if B2 LNA treatment was inhibiting SRG activation as in case of Hsf1 LNA (Figure 8), however, since both the amyloid and B2 LNA activate SRGs, we did not see any reason for combining them in one experiment as we did in case of Hsf1 in Figure 8, in which we combined LNA treatment with amyloid beta treatment.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>2) Reviewers remain concerned about the strength of the data regarding the role of Hsf1 in B2 RNA processing (although it seems like the authors are currently working on important control experiments, which might alleviate reviewer's concerns.) The negative controls with recombinant proteins prepared similarly to Hsf1, and with similarly sized control RNAs are critical. In addition, the full gels for these experiments need to be shown so the formation of short B2 RNA products can be evaluated in conjunction with the loss of the full length B2 RNA. This will help distinguish between specific processing controlled by the B2 ribozyme/Hsf1 activity versus non-specific breakdown. Moreover, the sizes of the in vitro processed products should correlate with the 5' end peaks from Figure 3A if the cellular and in vitro processing indeed arises from the same mechanism.</p></disp-quote><p>We are grateful to the reviewers for this comment. Although some of these controls had already been presented in our previous studies, including control proteins not inducing B2 RNA processing and control RNAs not destabilized as rapidly as B2 RNA, we fully understand that it is due to the proposed biochemistry of B2 RNA as a potential ribozyme, and the difficulty to distinguish from non-specific RNA degradation, that additional data are required. To this end we respond below to the reviewer’s questions, and additionally we further test the effect of (i) changes in B2 RNA sequence itself and, (ii) denaturation of the Hsf1 protein on B2 RNA processing. In detail:</p><p>a) In new Figure 5F-I we now provide the following:</p><p><italic>–</italic> Incubation of a mutant B2 RNA in the presence and absence of Hsf1 and comparison with the same incubations with the original B2 RNA, that showed that acceleration of B2 RNA processing by Hsf1 is sequence-specific and, thus, not the result of non-specific RNA degradation.</p><p><italic>–</italic> Incubation of two control RNAs in the presence and absence of Hsf1 and comparison with same incubations with the B2 RNA, that also confirmed that Hsf1-induced processing is limited to B2 RNA.</p><p><italic>–</italic> Incubation of B2 RNA in the presence of a denatured Hsf1 and a control protein of similar size, that failed to accelerate B2 RNA processing as the native Hsf1 did.</p><p>b) In order to exclude non-specific RNA destabilization due to degradation, hydrolysis or B2 RNA endogenous self-cleavage, we have included in Figure 5 a number of control RNA incubations without protein in the same buffer (TAP) and for the same time as the samples treated with Hsf1 or control proteins. Full gels are also included now as two source files.</p><p>c) We have now performed short RNA-seq of the in vitro processed B2 RNA and compared the resulted fragments with those observed in vivo, now presented in the new Figure 5—figure supplement 1 A. This data reveals a similar processing pattern between the two conditions.</p></body></sub-article></article>
