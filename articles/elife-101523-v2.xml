signal a general alarm to the forebrain. If CGRP neurons serve as a true general alarm, their activation would modulate both passive nad active defensive behaviors depending on the magnitude and context of the threat. However, most prior research has focused on the role of CGRP neurons in passive freezing responses, with limited exploration of their involvement in active defensive behaviors. To address this, we examined the role of CGRP neurons in active defensive behavior using a predator-like robot programmed to chase mice. Our electrophysiological results revealed that CGRP neurons encode the intensity of aversive stimuli through variations in firing durations and amplitudes. Optogenetic activation of CGRP neurons during robot chasing elevated flight responses in both conditioning and retention tests, presumably by amplifying the perception of the threat as more imminent and dangerous. In contrast, animals with inactivated CGRP neurons exhibited reduced flight responses, even when the robot was programmed to appear highly threatening during conditioning. These findings expand the understanding of CGRP neurons in the PBN as a critical alarm system, capable of dynamically regulating active defensive behaviors by amplifying threat perception, and ensuring adaptive responses to varying levels of danger.</p></abstract><abstract abstract-type="plain-language-summary"><title>eLife digest</title><p>How animals decide to respond to threatening situations can be the difference between life and death. Most animals show different defensive behaviors depending on how severe the threat is. For example, if it is imminent, they may flee to escape. On the other hand, if a threat is less severe, they may freeze to avoid detection.</p><p>The brain uses its own ‘general alarm system’ to help recognize and respond to threats. This system is made up of nerve cells which detect potential threat signals, ‘analyze’ them, and relay information about them to other parts of the brain that trigger the appropriate response. In humans, imbalances in this response can lead to maladaptive defense responses, such as those seen in anxiety or post-traumatic stress disorders, where fear and avoidance responses are excessive in relation to the threat.</p><p>One population of nerve cells, known as CGRP neurons, can detect a wide range of signals, and are known to respond by triggering passive behavior, such as freezing. However, whether CGRP neurons also trigger active behaviors, such as fleeing, remained unclear. Therefore, Pyeon et al. set out to study how CGRP neurons influence both passive and active defensive behaviors in response to varying threat levels.</p><p>To create realistic ‘models’ of different threat intensities in the laboratory, Pyeon et al. used a predator-like robot programmed to chase mice at different speeds. The mice were genetically modified so that researchers could record the activity of CGRP neurons, as well as activate the neurons artificially using light.</p><p>Activating CGRP neurons in mice being chased at a slow speed led to fleeing responses comparable to those observed during a higher-speed chase. This suggests that enhancing the alarm signal by artificially activating CGRP neurons may have caused the mice to perceive the threat as more intense and to react as though the danger was greater than it actually was. In contrast, mice with their CGRP neurons artificially ‘switched off’ were very unlikely to flee or freeze regardless of the speed of the chase.</p><p>The findings reveal that CGRP neurons respond differently to varying threat levels and regulate both passive and active defensive behaviors. This highlights their important role in adapting defensive responses to the severity of the threat. Building on these insights, future studies could explore strategies to regulate CGRP neuron activity, potentially leading to therapeutic approaches to address conditions marked by exaggerated or insufficient threat responses.</p></abstract><kwd-group kwd-group-type="author-keywords"><kwd>CGRP</kwd><kwd>fear conditioning</kwd><kwd>fleeing</kwd><kwd>freezing</kwd><kwd>parabrachial nucleus</kwd><kwd>defensive behavior</kwd></kwd-group><kwd-group kwd-group-type="research-organism"><title>Research organism</title><kwd>Mouse</kwd></kwd-group><funding-group><award-group id="fund1"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100003725</institution-id><institution>National Research Foundation of Korea</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>2022M3E5E8017804</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Jo</surname><given-names>Yong Sang</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><funding-statement>The funders had no role in study design, data collection and interpretation, or the decision to submit the work for publication.</funding-statement></funding-group><custom-meta-group><custom-meta specific-use="meta-only"><meta-name>Author impact statement</meta-name><meta-value>CGRP neurons act as a general alarm system, modulating various defensive behaviors based on magnitude of threat.</meta-value></custom-meta></custom-meta-group></article-meta></front><body><sec id="s1" sec-type="intro"><title>Introduction</title><p>Effective survival necessitates a repertoire of dynamic defensive behaviors, encompassing both passive and active responses. Passive defensive strategies, such as freezing, help avoid detection from predators by reducing motion (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Blanchard and Blanchard, 1969a</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Fanselow, 1980</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Fanselow, 1982</xref>). In contrast, active defensive behaviors, including fleeing or fighting, enable animals to swiftly escape or confront imminent threats (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Blanchard and Blanchard, 1969b</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Bolles, 1970</xref>). The ability to adaptively switch between passive and active defenses in response to varying threat contexts is essential for optimizing survival outcomes, as demonstrated by studies utilizing naturalistic threat stimuli like predator-like robots or looming disks, which allowed the observation of various critical defensive behaviors (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Choi and Kim, 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Kang et al., 2022</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Pyeon et al., 2023</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">Telensky et al., 2011</xref>). A critical component of this adaptive response is the general alarm signal, which detects danger and plays a role in eliciting appropriate defensive behaviors in the face of threats. These signals help organisms quickly recognize and respond to potential threats. The mechanisms underlying these alarm signals can be studied through Pavlovian fear conditioning (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Bolles and Collier, 1976</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Fanselow and Poulos, 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">LeDoux, 2000</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Maren, 2001</xref>). In this process, a neutral sensory stimulus (conditioned stimulus or CS) is paired with an aversive unconditioned stimulus (US), leading to a conditioned response (CR) that can be expressed as either freezing or fleeing, depending on the specific features of the CS (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Borkar and Fadok, 2021</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Fadok et al., 2017</xref>) and US (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Lee et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Pyeon et al., 2023</xref>).</p><p>Neurons within the PBN that express CGRP have been suggested to function as general alarm signals in the brain (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">Palmiter, 2018</xref>). These neurons respond to noxious stimuli of diverse sensory modalities (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Campos et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Carter et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Chen et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Kang et al., 2022</xref>) and transmit interoceptive and exteroceptive information to the forebrain (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Bernard and Besson, 1988</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Chiang et al., 2019</xref>). Additionally, these CGRP neurons relay US information to the central amygdala during conventional fear conditioning with electric footshock (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Han et al., 2015</xref>). Prior studies have primarily focused on the role of CGRP neurons in mediating passive freezing behavior, demonstrating that activation of these neurons exclusively elicits immediate freezing behavior and contributes to the formation of fear memories (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Bowen et al., 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Han et al., 2015</xref>). However, for CGRP neurons to serve as a true general alarm system, they must be capable of transmitting threat-related signals and facilitating the coordination of appropriate defensive behaviors, whether passive or active. While the role of CGRP neurons in passive responses is well-established, their potential involvement in active defensive behaviors remains unexplored.</p><p>To address this, we employed a more dynamic and ecologically relevant US by using a predator-like robot to chase the animals, thereby incorporating an imminent threat. We hypothesized that CGRP neurons modulate adaptive defensive behaviors depending on the severity or type of threat. We first recorded CGRP neuron activity in response to various aversive stimuli including the robot chasing to determine whether they encode noxious stimuli differentially. We then manipulated CGRP activity—both activating and inactivating—during fear conditioning with robot chasing and footshock. Our results suggest that manipulation of CGRP neurons bidirectionally modulates conditioned fleeing behaviors through altering the perception of the threat. These results highlight the role of CGRP neurons as a general alarm signal, primarily facilitating passive defensive behaviors, while also engaging in active defensive behaviors in response to high-threat conditions.</p></sec><sec id="s2" sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><sec id="s2-1"><title>Differential responses of CGRP neurons to aversive stimuli of varying intensities</title><p>The response profiles of CGRP neurons in conventional fear conditioning with footshock have been well-reported (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Han et al., 2015</xref>).

To investigate the activity of CGRP neurons in response to robot chasing, in vivo recordings using the optical-tagging strategy were performed (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Jo et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Juarez et al., 2023</xref>).

Animals were first habituated to a tone (4 kHz; 70 dB; 10 s) as a CS in a rectangular box. The following day, the animals were placed in a donut-shaped maze and presented with the CS 10 times, each paired with an US of being chased by the robot at a speed of 70 cm/s for 3 s. When animals collided with the robot, it pushed them forward, increasing their fleeing speed (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1C</xref>). If an animal blocked its path, the robot continued to push it, but its speed decreased due to friction and reduced motor power, ensuring it did not run over the animal. On day 3, fear memory was assessed by presenting the CS alone 10 times in the same context as the habituation session. In this behavioral paradigm, animals engaged in both passive and active defensive strategies, as evidenced by freezing and flight responses during conditioning (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1C</xref>). Passive behavior was measured by freezing, defined as the absence of movement, while active behavior was represented by flight, quantified with a flight score calculated by dividing the average velocity during the CS by the average velocity during the pre-CS period (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Borkar et al., 2024</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Fadok et al., 2017</xref>). While both responses were observed during conditioning, the test day, conducted without the robot, showed increased freezing and reduced fleeing responses (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1C and D</xref>).</p><p>To identify CGRP neurons, 10 pulses of blue light (5 ms duration) at 30 Hz were delivered 10 times at the end of each behavioral recording session. Out of 183 PBN neurons, 84 cells with a high probability of light-evoked spikes (&gt;0.8) and a short spike latency (&lt;5.5 ms) after light onset were classified as CGRP neurons (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1E</xref>). Compared to habituation, CGRP neurons showed significantly increased excitation to the CS during conditioning and retention, but only within the first 1 s after CS onset (1.5-fold increase); this difference became non-significant starting at 2 s (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1G</xref>). However, these neurons exhibited significant excitation to the US with a fourfold increase (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1F and G</xref>). Our findings using the robot as the US revealed that CGRP neurons primarily represent US information, albeit to a lesser extent, the onset of US-predictive information.</p><p>Given that CGRP neurons preferentially respond to the aversive US, we next asked how CGRP neurons encode different types of aversive stimuli. To address this, we monitored the activity of CGRP neurons while the animals received three types of stimuli, each varying in perceived threat intensity: (1) a pinprick to the hind paw using a needle (approximately 0.5 s); (2) a tail pinch 2 cm from the tail base using forceps (1 s); and (3) being chased by a robot (3 s). These aversive stimuli elicited different defensive behaviors. The pinprick caused hind paw withdrawal, and the tail pinch triggered vocalizations (audible squeaks) and immediate escaping behavior, indicating the highest threat intensity, whereas the robot chasing prompted only escaping behavior without any vocalization. CGRP neurons showed significantly excited firing that was time-locked to the onset of all three aversive stimuli and maintained this activity throughout the duration of each stimulus. After the offset of the stimuli, neuronal activity gradually restored back to the baseline with a slight delay (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1H</xref>). These aversive stimuli elicited significantly different amplitudes of firing rates (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1I</xref>). During the tail pinch, which generated the strongest defensive behavior, CGRP neurons exhibited the highest excitation amplitude, ranging from 33 to 98 Hz, with an average of 58 Hz. Taken together, these results indicate that CGRP neurons represent the temporal characteristics and intensity of different aversive stimuli through variations in firing duration and amplitude.</p></sec><sec id="s2-2"><title>CGRP activation promotes conditioned fleeing in robot chasing and conditioned freezing in footshock</title><p>To determine whether increasing or decreasing CGRP neuronal activity would induce defensive behaviors other than freezing, we first observed which defensive behaviors were elicited by either stimulating or inhibiting CGRP neurons in the absence of any external stimuli. <italic>Calca<sup>Cre</sup></italic><sup>/+</sup> mice were randomly assigned to groups and bilaterally injected with either AAV-DIO-ChR2-mScarlet for activation, AAV-DIO-Jaws-GFP for inactivation, or AAV-DIO-eYFP for control, followed by the implantation of optic fibers over the PBN (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2A</xref>). To activate CGRP neurons, mice received 30 s of 40 Hz photostimulation, delivered four times, based on the observed spontaneous firing rate of approximately 43 Hz in response to robot chasing (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1I</xref>). For inactivation, CGRP neurons were inhibited for 2 s, followed by a 1 s ramp down, repeated in cycles until a total duration of 30 s. Jaws and control groups showed no difference in movement during light on and off phases, indicating that light delivery did not alter their defensive behavior (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2B</xref>).

In this group, the CS was not paired with the robot chasing; instead, the robot chasing was delivered within the inter-trial interval. Physical bumping occurred during robot chasing, potentially influencing the perception of threat. To ensure that differences in defensive behavior were not due to variations in bumping among the four groups, we analyzed bumping incidents and found no significant differences (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s1">Figure 3—figure supplement 1C</xref>; <xref ref-type="video" rid="video1">Video 1</xref>).

The robot speed, ranging from 70 to 90 cm/s, was carefully selected after testing various speeds to ensure that it effectively induced a conditioned response without posing harm to the animals. In the previous experiments, the robot moved at a speed of 70 cm/s, making one-and-a-half turns in the donut maze within 3 s. By increasing the speed to 80 cm/s, the robot made two full turns, and at 90 cm/s, it made two and a half turns within the same time frame. Additionally, we analyzed the correlation between robot speed and the number of physical bumps, revealing a significant positive relationship in which higher robot speeds led to more bumps (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5s1">Figure 5—figure supplement 1A</xref> and B).

Using a naturalistic paradigm with a robot and other aversive stimuli of varying threat levels, we recorded neuronal activity and found that CGRP neurons encode different threat intensities through variations in firing duration and amplitude. Optogenetic activation of these neurons during fear conditioning amplified the perceived threat posed by the US, making it seem more dangerous, while inhibiting them weakened it. The expression of defensive behaviors varied depending on the type of US: under robot chasing conditions, increased CGRP activity made the robot seem as if it were moving faster, driving the animals to flee more during both conditioning and the retention test. In contrast, under footshock conditions, elevated CGRP activity predominantly enhanced freezing responses. Systematically escalating robot speed to simulate higher threat levels strengthened conditioned fleeing responses, whereas silencing these neurons prevented the formation of active defensive behaviors. Overall, our findings indicate that CGRP neurons act as a general alarm system, primarily orchestrating freezing responses but also contributing to active defensive behaviors by intensifying the perception of heightened threats, ensuring responses are adapted to the level of danger.</p><p>The choice of defensive strategies depends on the perceived severity of the threat (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Fanselow and Lester, 2013</xref>). For instance, when an animal detects a predator at a relatively safe distance, freezing is the most likely defensive behavior, as it helps avoid detection. However, as the threat becomes more imminent and threat levels increase, freezing is no longer the optimal choice. At this point, the animal shifts from passive freezing to more active defense, adopting behaviors such as fleeing or, if necessary, fighting. However, most research on CGRP has utilized footshock (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Bowen et al., 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Han et al., 2015</xref>) or other aversive stimuli in small arenas (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Kang et al., 2022</xref>), potentially limiting the observation of fleeing responses and leading to a focus on passive freezing as the predominant behavior studied. In our study, we introduced different types of US designed to present an imminent threat. This approach allowed animals to perceive the threat through dynamic sensory inputs, with the distance to the threat being discernible. By incorporating the predator-like robot, we developed a behavioral paradigm that enabled animals to form fear memory while minimizing differences in bumping incidents between groups. Additionally, this paradigm allowed for the observation of two distinct defensive responses to the CS: passive freezing and active fleeing, providing a platform to explore defensive behaviors across varying threat contexts.</p><p>Recent studies have modified conventional fear conditioning protocols to investigate active defensive behaviors in animals (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Borkar et al., 2024</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Fadok et al., 2017</xref>). One such example is changing the CS to a serial-compound stimulus, where a pure tone is immediately followed by a white noise, inducing freezing and flight responses, respectively. While effective for observing transitions between freezing and fleeing, our electrophysiological data show that CGRP neurons are more excited in response to the US compared to the CS (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1F and G</xref>). Thus, altering the type of US is more appropriate for studying CGRP neurons. In addition, the robot allowed us to systematically increase threat levels by adjusting its speed, providing a more controlled approach to studying defensive behaviors. Our results showed that a robot speed of 70 cm/s did not induce fleeing response during the retention test (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figures 3F</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">5E</xref>); however, increasing the robot’s speed to 90 cm/s elicited conditioned flight responses in control mice. Moreover, CGRP activation combined with a 70 cm/s robot speed induced flight responses similar to those observed with a 90 cm/s robot speed in control mice. This suggests that CGRP activation amplifies the perceived threat, thereby promoting active defensive behaviors.</p><p>We optogenetically inhibited CGRP neurons in animals while they were being chased by the robot during conditioning. During this session, the Jaws group showed less freezing and fleeing compared to the control group. However, the reduced fear responses were not sustained on the retention test day, suggesting that transient inhibition during the chasing was insufficient to suppress the acquisition of fear memory (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3E</xref>). It has been reported that a square pulse can cause strong rebound excitation following inhibition (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Chuong et al., 2014</xref>). While ramped illumination reduces the magnitude of rebound excitation, it does not eliminate it entirely, leaving small residual excitation. This residual activity may have contributed to the formation of fear memory despite the inhibition of CGRP neurons. In a subsequent experiment with increased robot speed, we used TetTox to silence CGRP neurons more effectively compared to temporary inhibition. This group consistently showed lower fear responses compared to the control group even on the retention day, indicating a more significant impact on fear learning compared to transient inhibition. However, the progressive increase in freezing levels across trials during conditioning, even with CGRP neurons silenced (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6B</xref>), suggests the involvement of other pathways in processing the aversive stimuli. For instance, different populations of CGRP neurons in the parvocellular subparafascicular nucleus of the thalamus also respond to threats and relay negative emotional signals to the amygdala thereby contributing to aversive memory formation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Kang et al., 2022</xref>). Additionally, the midbrain periaqueductal gray (PAG) transmits aversive signals to the amygdala (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Johansen et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Johansen et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">Ozawa et al., 2017</xref>) and other forebrain structures (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Lefler et al., 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Esteban Masferrer et al., 2020</xref>), ensuring effective expression of defensive responses upon the detection of a threat. Although fear learning can occur through various pathways, our use of optogenetics and TetTox suggested that CGRP neurons contribute to both active and passive defensive behaviors, facilitating responses that are appropriate to the magnitude of the threat.</p><p>In conclusion, by employing both conventional footshock and a naturalistic paradigm, the present study emphasizes the role of CGRP neurons in facilitating both passive and active defensive behaviors. Optogenetic stimulation of CGRP neurons in the absence of external stimuli induced robust freezing, and their activation during conventional fear conditioning further amplified conditioned freezing, demonstrating their primary role in driving passive defensive responses. However, under heightened threat conditions, such as enhanced CGRP activation or faster robot speeds, these neurons also strengthened active defensive behaviors by amplifying perceived threat. These findings suggest that CGRP neurons detect and process threats, predominantly driving freezing behavior, while also enabling active responses under heightened danger to facilitate appropriate defensive behaviors aligned with the intensity of the threat.</p></sec><sec id="s4" sec-type="materials|methods"><title>Materials and methods</title><table-wrap id="keyresource" position="anchor"><label>Key resources table</label><table frame="hsides" rules="groups"><thead><tr><th align="left" valign="bottom">Reagent type (species) or resource</th><th align="left" valign="bottom">Designation</th><th align="left" valign="bottom">Source or reference</th><th align="left" valign="bottom">Identifiers</th><th align="left" valign="bottom">Additional information</th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td align="left" valign="bottom">Strain, strain background<break/>(<italic>Mus musculus</italic>)</td><td align="left" valign="bottom">B6.Cg-Calca<sup>tm1.1(cre/EGFP)Rpa</sup>/J</td><td align="left" valign="bottom">The Jackson Laboratory</td><td align="left" valign="bottom">RRID:<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://identifiers.org/RRID:IMSR_JAX:033168">IMSR_JAX:033168</ext-link></td><td align="left" valign="bottom"/></tr><tr><td align="left" valign="bottom">Strain, strain background<break/>(C57BL/6 J, C57BL/6 J)</td><td align="left" valign="bottom">C57BL/6 J</td><td align="left" valign="bottom">The Jackson Laboratory</td><td align="left" valign="bottom">RRID:<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://identifiers.org/RRID:IMSR_JAX:033168">IMSR_JAX:000664</ext-link></td><td align="left" valign="bottom"/></tr><tr><td align="left" valign="bottom">Recombinant DNA reagent</td><td align="left" valign="bottom">AAV-DIO-ChR2-mScarlet</td><td align="left" valign="bottom">IBS Virus Facility</td><td align="left" valign="bottom">N/A</td><td align="left" valign="bottom"/></tr><tr><td align="left" valign="bottom">Recombinant DNA reagent</td><td align="left" valign="bottom">AAV-DIO-Jaws-GFP</td><td align="left" valign="bottom"><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Jo et al., 2018</xref></td><td align="left" valign="bottom">N/A</td><td align="left" valign="bottom"/></tr><tr><td align="left" valign="bottom">Recombinant DNA reagent</td><td align="left" valign="bottom">AAV-DIO-eYFP</td><td align="left" valign="bottom">Addgene</td><td align="left" valign="bottom">RRID:<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://identifiers.org/RRID:Addgene_27056">Addgene_27056</ext-link></td><td align="left" valign="bottom"/></tr><tr><td align="left" valign="bottom">Recombinant DNA reagent</td><td align="left" valign="bottom">AAV-DIO-TetTox-GFP</td><td align="left" valign="bottom"><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Han et al., 2015</xref></td><td align="left" valign="bottom">N/A</td><td align="left" valign="bottom"/></tr><tr><td align="left" valign="bottom">Software, algorithm</td><td align="left" valign="bottom">ANY-maze 5.3</td><td align="left" valign="bottom">Stoelting Co</td><td align="left" valign="bottom">N/A</td><td align="left" valign="bottom"/></tr><tr><td align="left" valign="bottom">Software, algorithm</td><td align="left" valign="bottom">GraphPad Prism</td><td align="left" valign="bottom">GraphPad software</td><td align="left" valign="bottom">N/A</td><td align="left" valign="bottom"/></tr><tr><td align="left" valign="bottom">Software, algorithm</td><td align="left" valign="bottom">SPSS</td><td align="left" valign="bottom">IBM</td><td align="left" valign="bottom">N/A</td><td align="left" valign="bottom"/></tr><tr><td align="left" valign="bottom">Software, algorithm</td><td align="left" valign="bottom">Offline Sorter</td><td align="left" valign="bottom">Plexon Inc</td><td align="left" valign="bottom">N/A</td><td align="left" valign="bottom"/></tr></tbody></table></table-wrap><sec id="s4-1"><title>Animals</title><p>We used heterozygous <italic>Calca<sup>Cre</sup></italic><sup>/+</sup> mice, generated by breeding Calca<italic><sup>Cre/Cre</sup></italic> (Cat. 033168) with C57BL/6 J (Cat. 000664) from Jackson Laboratory. Both male and female mice, aged 3–6 mo, were used in all studies, and no sex differences were observed. Mice were housed in a temperature- and humidity-controlled facility on a 12 hr light/dark cycle (lights off at 7 AM) with ad libitum access to food and water. All experiments were performed during the dark phase of the cycle under the guidelines of the Institutional Animal Care and Use Committee at the Korea University (KUIACUC-2022–0057).</p></sec><sec id="s4-2"><title>Virus production</title><p>All AAV vectors were prepared as described previously (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">Pyeon et al., 2024</xref>). Cre-dependent optogenetic viruses included AAV-DIO-ChR2-mScarlet, AAV-DIO-Jaws-GFP, and AAV-DIO-eYFP (control and unpaired). For selective inactivation of CGRP neurons, AAV-DIO-TetTox-GFP was used. Viral aliquots were stored at –80℃ before stereotaxic injection.</p></sec><sec id="s4-3"><title>Stereotaxic surgery</title><p>Mice were anesthetized with isoflurane (4% induction, 1.5–2% maintenance) and fixed on a stereotaxic frame (Model 942, David Kopf Instruments). After exposing the skull, bregma and lambda were aligned on the same horizontal plane. Small burr holes were then made for viral injections and optic fibers, and additional holes were drilled for anchoring screws. Cre-dependent virus (0.5 µl per side) was injected unilaterally or bilaterally into the PBN (5.0 mm posterior, 1.5 mm lateral, and 3.5 mm ventral to bregma) at a rate of 0.25 µl /min. Microdrives or optic fibers (200 µm diameter, 0.22 numerical aperture) were implanted 0.3 mm dorsal to the virus injection sites and secured with dental cement. Meloxicam (1.5 mg/kg) was administered subcutaneously to alleviate pain and reduce inflammation. Mice were allowed to recover for 2–3 wk before the start of behavioral experiments.</p></sec><sec id="s4-4"><title>30s stimulation of CGRP stimulation</title><p>Two weeks after surgery, the optic fibers implanted in the mice were connected to optic cables, and the animals were placed in an open arena (30 × 22 × 22 cm). After 2 min of exploration, CGRP neurons were either stimulated or inhibited four times at 60 s intervals. For activation, 40 Hz of blue light (473 nm; LaserGlow) was delivered for 30 s. For inactivation, continuous red light (640 nm; LaserGlow) was delivered for 3 s followed by a 1 s ramp down, repeated in cycles until a total duration of 30 s. The light output from the bilateral branching cable was set to 9±0.5 mW. The animals’ behavior was recorded using a camera mounted on the ceiling of the chamber. Freezing and movement velocities were analyzed using video-tracking software (ANY-maze, Stoelting Co.).</p></sec><sec id="s4-5"><title>Fear conditioning with chasing robot</title><p>Fear conditioning experiment was conducted using a box-shaped robot (15 × 26 × 35 cm) with four high-traction wheels that moved quickly inside a white acrylic track (18 cm width) of a donut-shaped maze (60 cm outer diameter). The speed of the robot was controlled by a Bluetooth-based microcontroller with a custom-written program in Arduino, and the CS (4 kHz; 80 dB; 10 s) was generated by speakers mounted in the front and back of the robot. Habituation and fear responses to the CS were tested before and after conditioning in a rectangular box (30 × 27 × 20 cm). The maze and rectangular box were wiped with 70% ethanol between animals. The custom-written program required for the robot’s operation is provided in the source code file 1.</p><p>On the first day of fear conditioning paradigm, habituation to the CS was performed. Mice were introduced to the rectangular box and allowed a 3 min exploratory period, followed by the presentation of 4 CSs at intervals of 60 s. During this phase, the chasing robot was positioned outside the rectangular box to prevent the animals from seeing it. On day 2, optic fiber cables were attached to the head of each mouse, which were then placed in the donut-shaped maze. After 3 min, mice received 10 associations of a 10 s CS, each co-terminating with 3 s of chasing (speed of 70, 80, or 90 cm/s) with 60 s interval. The robot chased animals at high speeds and posed a physical threat by colliding and pushing them. During robot chasing, CGRP neurons were either activated or inhibited. To optogenetically stimulate, 30 Hz of blue light was delivered for 3 s with the robot. For inhibition, continuous red light was delivered for 3 s followed by a 1 s ramp down with the robot. For the unpaired group, the same number of CSs was presented; however, the robot chased the animals at a random time within the ITI. On day 3, fear response to the CS was measured. Mice were placed in the same rectangular box used on the first day, and after 3 min, the CS was presented alone 4 times at 60 s intervals. During conditioning procedures, the animals’ behavior was recorded using a camera mounted on the ceiling of the chamber. Freezing and movement velocities were analyzed using ANY-maze. Freezing behavior was automatically detected when movement was absent for at least 0.8 s. For fleeing responses, flight score was calculated following previous studies (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Borkar and Fadok, 2021</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Fadok et al., 2017</xref>). Speed (cm/s) was extracted using the animal’s center body point, and the flight score was measured by dividing the average speed during each CS alone period by the speed during the same length of the pre-CS period. For conditioning trials, the CS alone period was the first 7 s from CS onset, while for the habituation and retention tests, it was 10 s. Vertical movements, such as jumping, were manually recorded by an experimenter blind to the group assignments, with 1 point added to the flight score for each escape jump. The number of times the mice bumped into the robot was manually scored by an experimenter who was blinded to the group assignments of the animals. We divided each group into two to three animal batches and replicated the experiments to confirm the consistency of the results across these batches.</p></sec><sec id="s4-6"><title>Fear conditioning with electrical footshock</title><p>A standard fear conditioning paradigm with electric footshock was conducted in four identical chambers (21.6 × 17.8 × 12.7 cm; Med Associates) placed inside sound-attenuating boxes. Each chamber was equipped with two speakers on one wall with 24 shock grids on the floor wired to a scrambled shock generator. Tone habituation and retention test of fear memory was tested in a different context where white plastic panels (20 × 16 × 12 cm) were inserted inside the chamber covering the walls and grids. The chamber and inserts were cleaned with 70% ethanol between animals.</p><p>After a week of resting period from fear conditioning paradigm with the robot, animals underwent conventional fear conditioning paradigm. On day 1, mice were habituated to a different CS (12 kHz; 80 dB; 10 s). The white plastic panels were inserted inside the chamber, and the animals were allowed to freely explore the context for 3 min. The CS was then presented four times with an ITI of 60 s. On the next day, after 3 min of free exploration, the animals received 10 CS–US trials, each co-terminating with a 1 s footshock (0.3 mA) with a 60 s ITI. CGRP neurons were either activated or inhibited during footshock delivery. For activation, 30 Hz of blue light was delivered during footshock presentation. For inhibition, continuous red light was delivered for 1 s followed by a 1 s ramp down during footshock presentation. To add a context-specific odor, a petri dish filled with a 1% acetic acid solution was placed under the grid floor. On day 3, fear memory in response to the CS was tested. As on the first day, animals were placed in the chamber with the white plastic panels, and the CS was presented four times at 60 s intervals. Animal behavior was recorded during the experiments by a camera installed on the ceiling, and freezing and fleeing responses were analyzed afterward.</p></sec><sec id="s4-7"><title>Single-unit recording</title><p>A custom-made microdrive containing four tetrodes (20 µm diameter tungsten wire; California Fine Wire) glued to one optic fiber (200 µm core diameter, 0.22 numerical aperture) was used. Tetrode tips were cut to protrude beyond the optic fiber by 400–500 µm and were gold-plated to reach impedances of 200–500 kΩ, tested at 1 kHz. After the recovery period from surgery, individual mice were placed in a holding cage, and single-unit activity was monitored using a Cheetah data acquisition system (Digital Lynx SX, Neuralynx). Neural signals were filtered between 0.6 and 6 kHz, digitized at 32 kHz, and amplified 1000–8000 times. To identify ChR2-expressing units in the PBN, 10 blue light pulses (473 nm; 5 ms width; 4–10 mW/mm<sup>2</sup> intensity; Laswerglow technologies) were delivered at 30 Hz via the optic fiber. If no light-responsive units were detected, the tetrodes were lowered by 40–80 µm increments, up to 160 µm per day. Once light-responsive units were found, behavioral recording sessions began.</p><p>During daily recording sessions, spontaneous spikes from PBN neurons were recorded in the home cage for 10 min. Neuronal firing rates were further recorded during fear conditioning sessions over three consecutive days. On day 1, mice were first habituated to a tone (10 kHz, 80 dB, 10 s duration) as the conditioned stimulus (CS) for 10 times. On day 2, mice underwent 10 exposures to the CS, each co-terminated with an unconditioned aversive stimulus (US) consisting of 3 s of chasing by a robot, with an average inter-trial interval (ITI) of 100 s. On day 3, mice were tested for fear retention with 10 presentations of the CS alone. At the end of each recording session, 10 trains of 10 light pulses (total 100 presentations; 30 s intervals) were delivered to identify ChR2-expressing CGRP neurons in the PBN. The tetrodes were kept in the same location to compare neuronal responses to the CS across 3 d of conditioning. However, neurons recorded across 3 d were considered independent units rather than the same units.</p><p>After completing the fear conditioning sessions, neuronal firing rates were recorded in response to three different aversive stimuli: pinprick, tail pinch, and robot chasing. Pinprick and tail pinch were administered by a trained experimenter throughout all recording sessions to ensure minimal variability, as described previously (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">Pyeon et al., 2024</xref>). For the pinprick, mice were placed in a white cylindrical Plexiglass container (14 cm in diameter, 20 cm in height) with a plastic grid floor, and hind paws were pinpricked with a 26 G syringe needle (approximately 0.5 s duration). For the tail pinch, mice were placed in a rectangular Plexiglass cage (27 × 18 × 8 cm), and the tail was pinched using forceps (1 s duration). For the robot chasing, mice were chased by the same robot used in the conditioning sessions but without the predictive CS. After the daily recording session, all tetrodes were lowered by 40–80 µm to find different light-responsive neurons and the mouse was returned to its home cage.</p><p>Neuronal spikes were isolated based on various waveform characteristics using Offline Sorter (Plexon). Stably firing units throughout the behavioral recording session were further analyzed using MATLAB software (MathWorks). To classify CGRP neurons, peri-event time histograms (PETHs; 11.11 ms bins) were constructed around the light presentations. Spike probability and latency were calculated for individual units in response to a total of 100 light pulses, and a cluster analysis was conducted on all units. The cluster with the highest spike probability (&gt;0.8) and the shortest latency (&lt;5.5 ms) was identified as CGRP neurons. These neurons also showed higher correlations between spontaneous and light-evoked waveforms, compared with optically insensitive PBN neurons. To further examine responses of CGRP neurons to aversive stimuli, PETHs (50 s-ms bins) were generated around the time of these aversive stimuli. Firing rates in PETHs were converted to z-scores relative to baseline firing rates observed during 3 s period before each stimulus. Average neuronal responses to aversive stimuli were measured during 0.65 s window from stimulus onset.</p></sec><sec id="s4-8"><title>Histology</title><p>After completion of all behavioral experiments, mice were anesthetized and transcardially perfused with phosphate-buffered saline (PBS) followed by 4% paraformaldehyde (PFA).

Your article has been reviewed by 3 peer reviewers, and the evaluation has been overseen by a Reviewing Editor and Kate Wassum as the Senior Editor.</p><p>The reviewers have discussed their reviews with one another, and the Reviewing Editor has drafted this to help you prepare a revised submission.</p><p>Essential revisions (for the authors):</p><p>Three reviewers have assessed your manuscript and are asking that you revise and resubmit your findings. While all three reviewers saw the experiments as addressing an important topic, there were a variety of concerns about the experimental design and statistical reporting. These concerns must be fully addressed in any resubmission.</p><p>The biggest concern was how fleeing is being reported – by flight count. Flight counts are very low and may not be amendable to standard statistical analyses. Reporting an additional flight metric, such as speed, may provide a better overall picture of the behavior and be more amendable to statistical analyses.</p><p>Another concern was the design and reporting of behavior during the predator-like robot experiments. First, these experiments did not use any sort of control cue, so it is unclear to what degree cue-evoked behavior is due to the relationship with predator rotation. Second, from the manuscript it is totally unclear how the mice behaved during this session, and how they are interacting with the predator. Are there frequent collisions? What is the pattern of fleeing like during these sessions?</p><p>Finally, experimental evidence showing that CGRP neuron activation is necessary and sufficient to produce flight is not substantiated. Instead, manipulations are focused on altering the intensity of the unconditioned stimulus – the predator-like robot.</p><p>In addition to these consensus concerns, several other concerns were raised by individual reviewers. These concerns should also be addressed in any resubmission.</p><p><italic>Reviewer #1 (Recommendations for the authors):</italic></p><p>Excellent work. My only recommendation is to use control (unpaired) procedures in the robot US setting. Need to be confident your observed flight behavior is due to pairing of the CS and US.</p><p><italic>Reviewer #2 (Recommendations for the authors):</italic></p><p>I would like to congratulate the authors on a well-executed and insightful study. The innovative approach and comprehensive analysis presented in this manuscript make a significant contribution to our understanding of the role of CGRP neurons in defensive behaviors. The findings are robust and clearly demonstrate the dual role of these neurons in modulating both passive and active responses to threats. The manuscript is well-written, the methods are sound, and the results are compelling. I believe this work will have a meaningful impact on the field and offer valuable insights for future research. I commend the authors for their excellent work and have no further suggestions at this time.</p><p><italic>Reviewer #3 (Recommendations for the authors):</italic></p><p>1. In this study, Pyeon et al. employ a predator-like robot to chase the animals to simulate naturalistic threat imminence in mice. While the idea and attempt are well intentioned, the overall data suggests the model is only inducing weak unconditional responses to the robot. Mice show only a small number of fleeing attempts compared to the number of robot chase trials.</p><p>2. For the conventional threat conditioning experiment, the authors subjected previously robot-conditioned mice to sequential conditioning. This resulted in a higher fleeing count in the ChR2 group during the habituation session (Figure 4 C). This effect could be due to a sensitization effect caused by previous ChR2 stimulation of the CGRP neurons.</p><p>3. The speed of the robot used in this study (70-90 cm/s) is quite high and is likely to cause frequent collisions with the mouse. The paper does not describe what happens if the robot collides with the mouse. Does it stop? Does it push the mouse forward? The behavior during the conditioning session needs to be reported in much more detail. Also, the small number of flight bouts in all experiments suggests that the robot is not being perceived as a high-intensity threat.</p><p>4. It is exceedingly difficult to discern how fleeing counts are defined and quantified. Because fleeing is being reported as counts, this indicates that these are discrete data, therefore, ANOVA is not an appropriate statistical method. ANOVAs assume continuous data and a normal distribution.</p><p>5. In Figure 3 B-C, ChR2 stimulation did not further elevate the freezing or fleeing count during the conditioning phase. Since US-mediated neuronal activation was elevated for at least 3 sec post termination of the US (Figure 1F, H), ChR2 stimulation should be performed for such an extended period. If possible, authors should also present the post-US data (do the mice freeze after the robot?).</p><p>6. The intensity of the pinprick and tail pinches are not defined and are potentially inconsistent across the mice as these stimuli are administered manually.</p><p>7. On page 9, the authors state the following about the ChR2 stimulation, &quot;Combined with the spontaneous firing rate during robot chasing (about 40 Hz), this totaled approximately 70 Hz, matching the peak firing rate observed in the upper quartile during tail pinch&quot;. ChR2 simulation will entrain the neuron to fire with each pulse up to approximately 20 Hz, after which the failure rate increases. In effect, neurophysiology does not work in an additive fashion.</p><p>8. The authors claim, &quot;We hypothesized that CGRP neurons contribute to the selection of adaptive defensive behaviors by signaling the severity of the threat&quot;. The selection of defensive behavior is not tested in these experiments</p><p>[Editors' note: further revisions were suggested prior to acceptance, as described below.]</p><p>Thank you for resubmitting your work entitled &quot;Parabrachial CGRP neurons modulate conditioned active defensive behavior under a naturalistic threat&quot; for further consideration by <italic>eLife</italic>. Your revised article has been evaluated by Kate Wassum (Senior Editor) and Michael McDannald (Reviewing Editor).</p><p>The three reviewers agree that the revisions made strengthened the manuscript. However, additional revisions are needed. These are addressed in full below. The most important changes are clarifying language about the non-associative nature of flight and the role for CGRP neurons in flight vs US activity.</p><p><italic>Reviewer #1 (Recommendations for the authors):</italic></p><p>In my initial review I expressed concern that the flight observed to the cue was not due to pairing with the chasing robot, but would be observed to any cue played in the context. In response, the authors ran a cohort of unpaired mice which received cue presentations and the chasing robot at different times. I appreciate the authors including this control group. However, as was my concern, there is very poor evidence that flight in this setting is due to pairing with the chasing robot. Within the chasing sessions, paired and unpaired mice are showing comparable levels of flight. Further, in the extinction test unpaired mice appear to show even greater flight than the paired mice. By contrast, freezing shows specificity to paired mice and is readily observed during extinction testing. This is problematic for flight because it shows that the same mice not showing conditioned flight show conditioned freezing. Recent studies in both mice and rats that have used appropriate control cues have observed robust conditioned flight. That bar is not reached in this manuscript.</p><p>Because the authors addressed my concerns, I am positively inclined towards the manuscript. However, because there is very little evidence that conditioned active defensive behaviors were observed, the authors need to refrain from using the term in the title and the manuscript. Further, the authors need to describe flight in a way that does not describe or suggest that it is conditioned or learned. This only seems correct given their observations of unpaired responding.</p><p><italic>Reviewer #3 (Recommendations for the authors):</italic></p><p>The manuscript by Pyeon et al. has been improved by the addition of additional analysis, an unpaired control condition, and clarification of experimental design. I have a few remaining concerns which should be addressed.</p><p>1. There remain numerous instances in the text that imply that CGRP neurons are capable of inducing escape behavior (Lines 59-60; 71-72; 260-262; 315-316), yet this is not demonstrated experimentally. In fact, when CGRP neurons are optogenetically activated in the absence of external stimuli, they induce freezing behavior, not flight (Figure 2; Lines 142-143). What the authors show is that CGRP neurons are important for US encoding, which under the right experimental conditions can allow the CS to elicit flight behavior (i.e., under high threat conditions). The authors should change their language or demonstrate that CGRP neurons can elicit flight. Further to this point, the TetTox approach does not allow for the disambiguation of CGRP neuron involvement in different phases of learning or expression (Lines 312-313).</p><p>2. The authors describe what happens when the robot collides with the mouse (e.g., Lines 89-90). The authors should provide a video demonstrating this, and I would like to see a quantification of how the animal's speed is altered by collision. The authors also state that bumping leads to stronger conditioned defensive behaviors (Lines 155-156) but these data are not shown. This correlation should be shown.</p><p>3. The argument given in Lines 174-176 should be rephrased to indicate that this is a hypothesis for why the Jaws group had freezing similar to control levels.</p><p>4. The authors claim that collisions with the robot push the mouse forward but do not harm the animal, yet in Lines 298-299 they posit that prolonged neuronal excitation was &quot;presumably due to the pain experienced after bumping into robot&quot;. Which is it, painful or innocuous?</p><p>5. A more accurate Figure title for Figure 3 would be &quot;Activation of CGRP neurons during US presentation enhances active defensive behavior&quot;.</p><p>6. Figure 5 needs a new title as CGRP neurons are not manipulated or recorded in these experiments.</p><p>7. The authors should comment on the fact that the TetTox mice react normally to US exposure (Figure 6). Which pathways are mediating the US behavioral response?</p></body></sub-article><sub-article article-type="reply" id="sa2"><front-stub><article-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.101523.sa2</article-id><title-group><article-title>Author response</article-title></title-group></front-stub><body><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Essential revisions (for the authors):</p><p>Three reviewers have assessed your manuscript and are asking that you revise and resubmit your findings.

Mice show only a small number of fleeing attempts compared to the number of robot chase trials.</p></disp-quote><p>We thank the reviewer for the valuable comments and agree that the flight count we initially presented may not fully capture the robustness of the behavior. To address this, we re-analyzed our flight data using the flight score method described by Fadok et al., which is calculated by dividing the average speed during each CS by the pre-CS speed over 10 seconds (Fadok et al., 2017). This method better reflects both the speed and the number of fleeing bouts during the CS.</p><p>Our re-analysis revealed that even mice in the control group exhibited higher flight scores during conditioning, with an average score of approximately 4. Additionally, using this more sensitive method of quantifying flight responses, we observed a significant difference in flight scores between the ChR2 and control groups during conditioning—a difference not evident with our previous counting method. The manuscript has been updated accordingly, including revised figures and additional velocity data during conditioning.</p><p>These updated results confirm that the robot paradigm induces stronger flight responses than previously reported, and the activation of CGRP neurons further amplifies these responses. We appreciate the reviewer’s valuable feedback, which allowed us to enhance our data and improve the manuscript.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>2. For the conventional threat conditioning experiment, the authors subjected previously robot-conditioned mice to sequential conditioning. This resulted in a higher fleeing count in the ChR2 group during the habituation session (Figure 4 C). This effect could be due to a sensitization effect caused by previous ChR2 stimulation of the CGRP neurons.</p></disp-quote><p>We appreciate the reviewer for the thoughtful comment. The reviewer is correct that previously robot-conditioned mice exhibited a higher fleeing count in the ChR2 group during the habituation session and now also in the first trial block with our new analysis. This increased response could indeed be attributed to sensitization or fear generalization from the prior exposure to the robot threat. While we attempted to mitigate by allowing a one-week resting period and using a different tone for the CS, it is possible that some degree of sensitization or generalization remained.</p><p>However, we would like to emphasize that this heightened fleeing response was transient and did not persist throughout the conditioning trials. Importantly, during the retention test, the ChR2 group showed similarly low levels of flight scores compared to the control group. We appreciate the reviewer's valuable input and have carefully considered these observations. While sensitization may have influenced the early fleeing responses, we believe the overall conclusions of our study remain robust. The transient nature of this response does not detract from our finding that activation of CGRP neurons in the conventional threat conditioning paradigm primarily induces freezing behavior.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>3.

The paper does not describe what happens if the robot collides with the mouse. Does it stop? Does it push the mouse forward? The behavior during the conditioning session needs to be reported in much more detail. Also, the small number of flight bouts in all experiments suggests that the robot is not being perceived as a high-intensity threat.</p></disp-quote><p>We appreciate the reviewer’s concern regarding the robot's speed and its interactions with the animals. Given that this robot-based paradigm is relatively novel, we agree that the interactions between the robot and the animals, particularly during collisions, should have been explained in more detail.</p><p>The robot speed, ranging from 70 to 90 cm/s, was carefully selected after testing various speeds to ensure that it effectively induces a conditioned response without posing harm to the animals. When animals collided with the robot while running away, the robot would push them, causing the animals to increase their fleeing speed. In rare instances where an animal froze during the chase, the robot would push the animal forward; however, due to friction and reduced motor power, the robot's speed would naturally slow down, ensuring it does not run over or harm the animal but pushes it forward at a lower pace.</p><p>As the reviewer rightly pointed out, the behavior during the conditioning session requires more detailed reporting. In response, we have included velocity data for 10-s intervals – before, during, and after the CS – in Figure 3D and 5C. This data provides a more detailed visualization of the animals' movement patterns in relation to the robot’s speed during conditioning. By offering velocity data at these key time intervals, we believe it effectively captures and illustrates how the animals react to the robot's approach and collisions, providing a clearer representation of their behavior throughout the session. Additionally, we have updated the manuscript to include detailed information on what occurs during collisions between the robot and the animals. The updated section states:</p><p>“When animals collided with the robot, it pushed them forward, increasing their fleeing speed. If an animal blocked its path, the robot continued to push it, but its speed decreased due to friction and reduced motor power, ensuring it did not run over the animal.”</p><p>Regarding the small number of flight bouts in our experiments, our updated analysis now reveals significantly higher flight scores, indicating that the robot is perceived as a higher-intensity threat. The revised figures and analysis are reflected in the updated manuscript.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>4. It is exceedingly difficult to discern how fleeing counts are defined and quantified. Because fleeing is being reported as counts, this indicates that these are discrete data, therefore, ANOVA is not an appropriate statistical method. ANOVAs assume continuous data and a normal distribution.</p></disp-quote><p>We appreciate the reviewer’s feedback regarding the quantification of fleeing counts. While we aimed to clarify this in the original manuscript, we recognize that further explanation may be needed. What we have done is extract the raw velocity data and count the peaks that exceeded 8 cm/s, with a minimum inter-peak interval of 0.6 s. The 8 cm/s threshold was determined by comparing the velocity data with experimenter observations of fleeing behavior, ensuring that all movements at or above this speed were consistently identified as fleeing events. However, in response to the reviewer’s concerns about the small number of flight counts, we transitioned to using flight scores rather than counts. We made sure that the method for quantifying the flight score is clearly explained in the manuscript. The revised section in the manuscript now states:</p><p>“For fleeing responses, flight score was calculated following previous studies (Fadok et al., 2017; Borkar et al., 2024). Speed (cm/s) was extracted using the animal’s center body point, and the flight score was measured by dividing the average speed during each CS alone period by the speed during the same length of the pre-CS period. For conditioning trials, the CS alone period was the first 7 s from CS onset, while for the habituation and retention tests, it was 10 s. Vertical movements, such as jumping, were manually recorded by an experimenter blind to the group assignments, with 1 point added to the flight score for each escape jump.”</p><p>We appreciate the reviewer’s thorough attention to the statistical analysis in our study. With the flight count data, we first confirmed that it met the normality assumptions and proceeded with ANOVA. However, we realize that we did not clearly mention this in the manuscript, which may have caused some confusion regarding the appropriateness of using ANOVA. We have updated all the statistics and figures in the manuscript accordingly. We sincerely thank the reviewer for this valuable opportunity to reanalyze the data, which has further strengthened the robustness of our findings. However, transitioning to flight scores have addressed this issue, as the flight scores allowed us to appropriately meet the assumptions required for ANOVA.</p><p>We have updated all the statistics and figures in the manuscript accordingly. We sincerely thank the reviewer for this valuable opportunity to reanalyze the data, which has further strengthened the robustness of our findings.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>5.

We sincerely thank the reviewer for this valuable opportunity to reanalyze the data, which has further strengthened the robustness of our findings. As the reviewer correctly pointed out, our electrophysiology data show that CGRP neurons remain elevated for at least 3 s following the termination of the US. While extending ChR2 stimulation for approximately 6 s could provide further insights, we found that even with the shorter 3-s stimulation, the ChR2 group showed a significantly elevated flight response in the updated analysis, which we believe effectively captures the impact of the stimulation.</p><p>Additionally, we have included velocity data during conditioning, showing the speed of animals during the pre-CS (10 s), CS, and post-CS (10 s). This data reveals a significant drop in speed during the post-CS period, indicating that the animals were most likely freezing after being chased by the robot. This freezing response was consistently observed across both groups, excluding the Jaws group.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>6.

While footshocks could have provided more consistent stimuli, we opted against their use, as they can introduce noise and artifacts. Although it is challenging to precisely define the intensity of pinprick and tail pinch, we selected these aversive stimuli for their suitability to our experimental design. To minimize variability, a trained experimenter administered the stimuli throughout all recording sessions. We have included details about these efforts, along with the needle size used, in the Methods section.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>7.

In response to the reviewer’s current comments, we would like to address specific points regarding the flight scores observed in the paired and unpaired groups In particular, we would like to highlight that the unpaired group exhibited significantly lower flight scores compared to the control group, during the chasing sessions.</p><p>During the conditioning sessions, the unpaired control group actually exhibited significantly lower flight scores than the paired group (repeated-measures two-way ANOVA, F(3, 36) = 102.05, <italic>p</italic> = .000; post-hoc test, <italic>p</italic> = .018), suggesting that they failed to effectively form fear memory. This result supports the importance of CS-US pairing in driving conditioned flight behavior. For the retention test, while the reviewer correctly noted that the unpaired group exhibited higher flight scores than the paired control group, we would like to clarify that this difference is attributable to the methodology of our updated flight score metric, which calculates the ratio of velocity during the CS to velocity during the pre-CS. While this method provides a sensitive measure of flight responses, it is also susceptible to small variations in pre-CS velocity. For instance, when animals moved slightly more during the CS compared to the pre-CS, their flight score could appear inflated, even if their actual velocity during the CS was insufficient to qualify as true flight behavior.</p><p>In the unpaired group, although flight scores during retention test were higher, their overall velocity in response to the CS did not exceed 3 cm/s (Figure 3—figure supplement 1D). This velocity range is more consistent with exploratory behavior rather than flight. We recognize that this distinction may not have been sufficiently explained in the original manuscript, potentially leading to confusion. To address this, we have updated the manuscript as follows:</p><p>“The unpaired group exhibited significantly lower freezing levels compared to the paired control group. However, flight scores in the unpaired group were significantly higher than those in the control group. This was likely due to the tendency of the control group to remain frozen before and during the CS presentation. The unpaired group, however, showed sensory orientation responses to the CS, contributing to their elevated fleeing scores. Moreover, the movement speed of the unpaired group during the tone CS did not exceed 3 cm/s, a range typically associated with exploratory behavior in open field tests, suggesting exploratory rather than defensive behavior in the test environment (Figure 3−figure supplement 1D).”</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>By contrast, freezing shows specificity to paired mice and is readily observed during extinction testing. This is problematic for flight because it shows that the same mice not showing conditioned flight show conditioned freezing. Recent studies in both mice and rats that have used appropriate control cues have observed robust conditioned flight. That bar is not reached in this manuscript.</p></disp-quote><p>As we have previously stated, the unpaired group displayed significantly lower levels of flight during the conditioning session, supporting the specificity of flight responses to CS-US pairing. However, the reviewer is correct that freezing behavior shows clear specificity to the paired control group, and we acknowledge this point. However, we would like to emphasize the defensive behavior observed in the control animals when the robot speed was escalated. Under high-speed conditions (90 cm/s), conditioned flight responses were reliably observed in the control animals. We believe the 70 cm/s condition used in the main paradigm may not have been sufficient to induce robust flight responses in animals. Nevertheless, even under the 70 cm/s condition, flight responses were reliably observed across trials of conditioning.</p><p>To further address this concern, we have included velocity traces from a representative animal across 10 trials of the conditioning session in the revised manuscript (Figure 1—figure supplement 1C). These traces demonstrate how an individual animal engages in a range of defensive behaviors during the CS, including freezing, flight, and transitions between these behaviors. We hope that this additional data and explanation address the reviewer’s concern and demonstrate that our novel paradigm reliably observes robust conditioned flight responses, further supporting the validity of our findings.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Because the authors addressed my concerns, I am positively inclined towards the manuscript. However, because there is very little evidence that conditioned active defensive behaviors were observed, the authors need to refrain from using the term in the title and the manuscript. Further, the authors need to describe flight in a way that does not describe or suggest that it is conditioned or learned. This only seems correct given their observations of unpaired responding.</p></disp-quote><p>We thank the reviewer for their valuable feedback and for guiding us toward a better interpretation of our data. Including the unpaired control group has been instrumental in evaluating the specificity of conditioned flight responses and ensuring a robust analysis. We recognize that our initial explanation may not have sufficiently clarified the differences in flight responses between the paired and unpaired groups. Specifically, the unpaired group exhibited fewer flight responses compared to the control group during conditioning, and while their flight scores appeared higher during the retention test, this likely reflected exploratory behavior rather than true flight.</p><p>In response to the reviewer’s insightful comment, we have revised our manuscript to better explain these findings and to ensure the terminology used accurately reflects the observations. We hope these revisions provide greater clarity and further strengthen the manuscript.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Reviewer #3 (Recommendations for the authors):</p><p>The manuscript by Pyeon et al. has been improved by the addition of additional analysis, an unpaired control condition, and clarification of experimental design. I have a few remaining concerns which should be addressed.</p></disp-quote><p>We appreciate the reviewer's previous comments, which have significantly strengthened our findings. We look forward to addressing the remaining concerns and making further updates to ensure the manuscript is as robust and clear as possible.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>1. There remain numerous instances in the text that imply that CGRP neurons are capable of inducing escape behavior (Lines 59-60; 71-72; 260-262; 315-316), yet this is not demonstrated experimentally. In fact, when CGRP neurons are optogeneticly activated in the absence of external stimuli, they induce freezing behavior, not flight (Figure 2; Lines 142-143). What the authors show is that CGRP neurons are important for US encoding, which under the right experimental conditions can allow the CS to elicit flight behavior (i.e., under high threat conditions). The authors should change their language or demonstrate that CGRP neurons can elicit flight. Further to this point, the TetTox approach does not allow for the disambiguation of CGRP neuron involvement in different phases of learning or expression (Lines 312-313).</p></disp-quote><p>We completely agree with the point that activation of CGRP neurons does not directly induce active defensive behavior. To address this, we have carefully revised all sections of the manuscript to ensure that our language no longer implies that CGRP neuron activation induces or triggers active defensive behavior. Below are examples of how we revised the manuscript, including updates to the last paragraph of our Discussion section. We sincerely appreciate the reviewer’s insightful comment, which has greatly clarified the interpretation of our findings.</p><p>“However, for CGRP neurons to serve as true general alarm system, they must be capable of transmitting threat-related signals and facilitating the coordination of appropriate defensive behaviors, whether passive or active.</p><p>These results highlight the role of CGRP neurons as a general alarm signal, primarily facilitating passive defensive behaviors, while also engaging in active defensive behaviors in response to high-threat conditions.</p><p>In conclusion, by employing both conventional footshock and a naturalistic paradigm, the present study emphasizes the role of CGRP neurons in facilitating both passive and active defensive behaviors. Optogenetic stimulation of CGRP neurons in the absence of external stimuli induced robust freezing, and their activation during conventional fear conditioning further amplified conditioned freezing, demonstrating their primary role in driving passive defensive responses. However, under heightened threat conditions, such as enhanced CGRP activation or faster robot speeds, these neurons also strengthened active defensive behaviors by amplifying perceived threat. These findings suggest that CGRP neurons detect and process threats, predominantly driving freezing behavior, while also enabling active responses under heightened danger to facilitate appropriate defensive behaviors aligned with the intensity of the threat.”</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>2. The authors describe what happens when the robot collides with the mouse (e.g., Lines 89-90). The authors should provide a video demonstrating this, and I would like to see a quantification of how the animal's speed is altered by collision. The authors also state that bumping leads to stronger conditioned defensive behaviors (Lines 155-156) but these data are not shown. This correlation should be shown.</p></disp-quote><p>We appreciate the reviewer’s attention to the details of our paradigm. In the previously included video (Movie 1), we demonstrated an animal’s response to the CS during conditioning and its interaction with the chasing robot. While this video already depicted changes in the animal's movement following collisions, our initial focus was on highlighting the flight response to the CS in the ChR2 group. However, as the reviewer pointed out, given that this is a novel paradigm, we recognize the value of providing a more detailed understanding of how the animal's movements are influenced by the robot. To address this, we have now referenced this video in the bumping section to provide additional context and enhance the interpretation of the paradigm.</p><p>Additionally, in response to the reviewer's comment, we have included a velocity trace from a representative animal to illustrate how speed changes after a collision (Figure 3—figure supplement 1C). In this figure, collision incidents are indicated with red arrows, demonstrating that animals tend to move forward with increased speed following a collision with the robot.</p><fig id="sa2fig1" position="float"><label>Author response image 1.</label><graphic mimetype="image" mime-subtype="tiff" xlink:href="elife-101523-sa2-fig1-v2.tif"/></fig><p>Regarding our earlier statement that bumping leads to stronger conditioned defensive behaviors, our intention was to emphasize that there were no group differences in bumping incidents across the four groups. In response to the reviewer's comment, we conducted additional analyses to examine the correlation between bumping incidents and conditioned defensive behaviors, as illustrated in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="sa2fig1">Author response image 1</xref>. While we did not find statistically significant correlations between bumping and defensive behaviors in most groups, we observed a positive correlation between bumping and freezing in the ChR2 group (r = 0.65, <italic>p</italic> &lt; 0.05). Based on these findings, we have removed the phrase 'bumping leads to stronger conditioned defensive behaviors' from the manuscript to avoid any potential misinterpretation. Therefore, we have revised the description to clarify our intention, and the updated manuscript now states:“Physical bumping occurred during robot chasing, potentially influencing the perception of threat. To ensure that differences in defensive behavior were not due to variations in bumping among the four groups, we analyzed bumping incidents and found no significant differences (Figure 3−figure supplement 1C; Movie 1). This confirms that any observed differences in defensive responses are likely attributable to alterations in CGRP neuronal activity.”</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>3. The argument given in Lines 174-176 should be rephrased to indicate that this is a hypothesis for why the Jaws group had freezing similar to control levels.</p></disp-quote><p>We appreciate the reviewer’s insightful comment, which allowed us to clarify our hypothesis regarding why the Jaws group exhibited freezing levels similar to the control group. Based on a published study in <italic>Nature Neuroscience</italic>, the use of Jaws, a red-shifted rhodopsin, can result in rebound activation even with ramped illumination (Chuong et al., 2014), as employed in our experiment. This rebound activation after the laser is turned off may explain the freezing behavior observed in the Jaws group. We have rephrased this section in the manuscript to clearly present this as a hypothesis and to better support our interpretation with existing literature. The revised text now states:</p><p>(Result section) “This result may be attributed to post-illumination rebound excitation, as Jaws has been shown to yield residual activity even when ramped illumination is used to minimize this effect (Chuong et al., 2014).”</p><p>(Discussion section) “However, the reduced fear responses were not sustained on the retention test day, acquisition of fear memory (Figure 3E). It has been reported that square pulse can cause strong rebound excitation following inhibition (Chuong et al., 2014). While ramped illumination reduces the magnitude of rebound excitation, it does not eliminate it entirely, leaving small residual excitation. This residual activity may have contributed to the formation of fear memory despite the inhibition of CGRP neurons.”</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>4. The authors claim that collisions with the robot push the mouse forward but do not harm the animal, yet in Lines 298-299 they posit that prolonged neuronal excitation was &quot;presumably due to the pain experienced after bumping into robot&quot;. Which is it, painful or innocuous?</p></disp-quote><p>We appreciate the reviewer’s thoughtful comment highlighting potential confusion in our language. What we meant by “did not harm the animal” when selecting higher robot speeds was that we ensured the robot's speed was not so high as to physically run over or cause harm to the animals. However, we acknowledge that “do not harm” may unintentionally imply an absence of pain. While we cannot directly measure pain in the animals, it is possible that chasing at high speeds and collisions could cause some discomfort or distress.</p><p>However, based on the reviewer’s previous comment regarding our hypothesis about the Jaws group's inhibition of CGRP neurons being insufficient, this section has now been removed. We are grateful for the reviewer’s attention to this matter and will take extra care to ensure clarity and precision in our terminology.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>5.

The authors should comment on the fact that the TetTox mice react normally to US exposure (Figure 6). Which pathways are mediating the US behavioral response?</p></disp-quote><p>As the reviewer noted, when CGRP neurons are silenced, responses to the US are generally reduced. For instance, in footshock experiments, silencing CGRP neurons impairs US processing, resulting in diminished sensitivity to the shock. However, during robot chasing, the mechanical properties of the US physically push the animals forward. This mechanical force is independent of CGRP neuron activity and compels the animals to move, even though their defensive responses to the CS are reduced compared to controls. As a result, the velocity of TetTox mice during the US appears similar to that of control animals, as their movement is driven by the physical force of the robot rather than by fear processing. However, information related to the US can still be processed through alternative mechanisms independent of CGRP neurons, as evidenced by the progressive increase in freezing levels observed in TetTox mice during conditioning under high-threat conditions with a robot speed of 90 cm/s (Figure 6B).</p><p>Reference</p><p>Chuong, A.
