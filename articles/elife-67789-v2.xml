pathogens to inject effectors into the cytosol of eukaryotic hosts to reprogram cellular functions. It is technically challenging to label effectors and the secretion machinery without disrupting their structure/function. Herein, we present a new approach for labeling and visualization of previously intractable targets. Using genetic code expansion, we site-specifically labeled SsaP, the substrate specificity switch, and SifA, a here-to-fore unlabeled secreted effector. SsaP was secreted at later infection times; SsaP labeling demonstrated the stochasticity of injectisome and effector expression. SifA was labeled after secretion into host cells via fluorescent unnatural amino acids or non-fluorescent labels and a subsequent click reaction. We demonstrate the superiority of imaging after genetic code expansion compared to small molecule tags. It provides an alternative for labeling proteins that do not tolerate N- or C-terminal tags or fluorophores and thus is widely applicable to other secreted effectors and small proteins.</p></abstract><kwd-group kwd-group-type="author-keywords"><kwd>genetic code expansion</kwd><kwd><italic>Salmonella</italic>-induced filaments</kwd><kwd>non-canonical amino acids</kwd><kwd><italic>Salmonella</italic></kwd><kwd>click chemistry</kwd><kwd>substrate specificity switch</kwd></kwd-group><kwd-group kwd-group-type="research-organism"><title>Research organism</title><kwd>Other</kwd></kwd-group><funding-group><award-group id="fund1"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100001459</institution-id><institution>Ministry of Education - Singapore</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>MOE2018-T2-1-038</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Kenney</surname><given-names>Linda J</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund2"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100007865</institution-id><institution>University of Texas Medical Branch</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>Texas STAR award</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Kenney</surname><given-names>Linda J</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><funding-statement>The funders had no role in study design, data collection and interpretation, or the decision to submit the work for publication.</funding-statement></funding-group><custom-meta-group><custom-meta specific-use="meta-only"><meta-name>Author impact statement</meta-name><meta-value>Genetic code expansion (GCE) enables site-specific labeling and visualization of <italic>Salmonella</italic> secreted effectors, secretion system components and provides a viable alternative for labeling proteins that do not tolerate N- or C-terminal tags.</meta-value></custom-meta></custom-meta-group></article-meta></front><body><sec id="s1" sec-type="intro"><title>Introduction</title><p><italic>Salmonellae</italic> use an evolved complex protein secretion system known as a type three secretion system (T3SS) to deliver virulence factors (referred to as effectors) directly into host cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib41">Marlovits et al., 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Kubori et al., 1998</xref>). The T3SS is a ‘needle-like’, complex, supramolecular structure that spans the bacterial inner and outer membrane and is capable of injecting effectors into the host (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib41">Marlovits et al., 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Kubori et al., 1998</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Erhardt et al., 2010</xref>). Inside the host cytoplasm, effectors manipulate host cell signaling pathways to drive pathogenesis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">LaRock et al., 2015</xref>). <italic>Salmonella</italic> uses two distinct T3SS that are encoded within <italic>Salmonella</italic> pathogenicity islands 1 and 2 that function at different times during infection. The <italic>Salmonella</italic> pathogenicity island 1 (SPI-1)-encoded T3SS delivers effectors that alter host actin cytoskeleton dynamics, leading to extensive plasma membrane ruffling and bacterial uptake (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">LaRock et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Galán and Waksman, 2018</xref>). Upon entry into host cells, <italic>Salmonella</italic> resides within an acidic membrane-bound compartment, the <italic>Salmonella</italic>-containing vacuole (SCV). The acid pH of the SCV acidifies the bacterial cytoplasm and activates <italic>Salmonella</italic> pathogenicity island 2 (SPI-2)-encoded T3SS (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">Liew et al., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Kenney, 2019</xref>) to translocate a cocktail of ~30 effectors across the vacuolar membrane into the host cytosol (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Erhardt et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">LaRock et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Galán and Waksman, 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">Liew et al., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Kenney, 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Jennings et al., 2017</xref>). This complex mixture of effectors induces massive remodeling of endosomes, leading to the formation of highly dynamic, extensive tubular membrane structures known as <italic>Salmonella</italic>-induced filaments (SIFs) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">LaRock et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Galán and Waksman, 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Jennings et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Garcia-del Portillo et al., 1993</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Drecktrah et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib59">Steele-Mortimer, 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Knuff and Finlay, 2017</xref>). SifA is one of the key effectors that is involved in SIF formation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib60">Stein et al., 1996</xref>); a <italic>sifA</italic> deletion eliminates SIF formation and attenuates virulence in the mouse (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Beuzón et al., 2000</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Brumell et al., 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib53">Ruiz-Albert et al., 2002</xref>). To understand how such effectors manipulate host cell biology, it is informative to examine the localization of SPI-2 effectors within host cells.</p><p>Labeling and localization of secreted T3SS effectors in the host has proven to be technically challenging (see <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib58">Singh and Kenney, 2021</xref> for a review). Earlier studies localized effectors by immunofluorescence of individually over-expressed effectors (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib46">Ohlson et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib43">McGourty et al., 2012</xref>). Not only was the stoichiometry of effectors disrupted by this approach, but also the effectors were not present at native copy numbers. Further, antibodies often produce off-target staining, and the location of epitope tag integration can be problematic (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib56">Schnell et al., 2012</xref>). The most conventional method for tracking and localization of proteins is to express the target protein fused to a fluorescent protein such as GFP or one of its variants. However, direct labeling of effectors with bulky fluorescent proteins interferes with secretion and jams the T3SS (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Akeda and Galán, 2005</xref>). The utility of the 4Cys-FLaSH tagging system is limited by low labeling specificity, a poor signal-to-noise ratio, and cellular toxicity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Enninga et al., 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib42">Martin et al., 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Adams et al., 2002</xref>). Tandem-repeat fluorescent tags such as split-GFP are also of limited value, because they do not overcome the dim signal from effectors expressed at low levels (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib66">Young et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib48">Park et al., 2017</xref>). All these methods require an additional protein tag fused to either the N- or C-terminus of the effector, and these tags, whether small or large, can perturb effector structure-function by disrupting trafficking or post-translational modification of fused effector proteins. Although the SPI-2 effector SseJ tolerated an HA-tag at its C-terminus (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Chakraborty et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Gao et al., 2018</xref>), we were unable to label SifA at either the N- or C-terminus or in intracellular loops and still preserve its function (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Gao et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Brumell et al., 2002</xref>). New strategies are therefore required to selectively label and visualize T3SS effectors in host cells during infection.</p><p>The T3SS systems share striking homology with the flagellar system and are believed to have evolved from a common ancestor (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib47">Pallen and Gophna, 2007</xref>). In the flagellar system, FliK functions as a ‘ruler’ protein to measure the hook length before switching to secrete the filament (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib57">Shibata et al., 2007</xref>). In pathogens such as <italic>Yersinia</italic>, <italic>Shigella</italic>, and <italic>Salmonella</italic>, FliK homologues control injectisome needle length (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Journet et al., 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib62">Wee and Hughes, 2015</xref>); its deletion produces long needles (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib44">Muramoto et al., 1998</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">Kubori et al., 2000</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">Magdalena et al., 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Bergeron et al., 2016</xref>). In the SPI-2 T3SS, SsaP is proposed to function in a similar manner (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib67">Yu et al., 2018</xref>), although its deletion does not produce long needles (Y. Yamanaka and L.J. Kenney, data not shown). SsaP is required for the secretion-specificity switch from substrates for injectisome assembly to the secretion of SPI-2 effectors, but its small size (124 amino acids) and low abundance makes labeling and visualization difficult. A C-terminal fusion with photoactivatable mCherry (PAmCherry) resulted in a fusion protein that was cleaved, preventing imaging of SsaP. How SsaP functions to control SPI-2 effector secretion is still unknown (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib67">Yu et al., 2018</xref>).</p><p>Genetic incorporation of non-canonical amino acids (ncAA) bearing bio-orthogonal chemical labeling handles such as azide, ring-strained alkynes, or alkenes into bacteria via genetic code expansion (GCE) provides a solution to these problems. A ncAA is first encoded by a nonsense codon (typically TAG) and is co-translationally incorporated into a protein of interest site-specifically, using a ncAA-specific orthogonal tRNA/aminoacyl-tRNA synthetase (tRNA/aaRS) pair (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Lang and Chin, 2014a</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Davis and Chin, 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Chin et al., 2002</xref>). Subsequently, the bacterial protein bearing a bio-orthogonal handle (such as azide, ring-strained alkenes) reacts with dibenzocyclooctyne (DBCO)/tetrazine (Tz)-containing fluorophores through catalyst free strain-promoted azide-alkyne cycloaddition (SPAAC) or strain-promoted inverse-electron–demand Diels–Alder cycloaddition (SPIEDAC) reactions (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Lang and Chin, 2014a</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Agard et al., 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib50">Plass et al., 2012</xref>) as illustrated in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1</xref> . Due to its high selectivity, fast reaction rate compared to SPAAC, and fluorogenic tetrazine fluorophore, the SPIEDAC click reaction has emerged as an invaluable selective bioconjugation tool in cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib50">Plass et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">Lang and Chin, 2014b</xref>). Since such a labeling approach is not limited to the N- or C-terminus of the effector of interest, and organic fluorophores are much smaller compared to fluorescent proteins (∼0.5 vs. ∼27 kDa), this approach reduces the potential negative impact of the fluorescent tags on the structure and function of labeled secreted effectors. The organic fluorophores can also offer superior photophysical properties and more spectral variants compared to fluorescent proteins.</p><fig id="fig1" position="float"><label>Figure 1.</label><caption><title>Scheme for site-specific fluorescent labeling of SPI-2 effectors.</title><p>(<bold>A</bold>) Chemical structure of 4-azidophenylalanine (AzF), 7-(Hydroxy-coumarin-4-yl) ethylglycine (Hco), trans-Cyclooct-2-en – L - Lysine (TCO*Lys), BDP-DBCO, and SiR-tetrazine. (<bold>B</bold>) Incorporation of a ncAA in a SPI-2 effector is schematically represented. A plasmid carrying the gene for an effector of interest (green) and an orthogonal suppressor tRNA (dark blue)/aminoacyl synthetase (orange) pair are introduced into the bacterial cell by transformation. The amber stop codon (TAG, red) replaces a native codon at a permissive site within the sequence of the effector gene. The ncAA (red stars) is supplemented in the growth medium. Inside the cell, the orthogonal synthetase specifically charges the orthogonal suppressor tRNA with the desired ncAA through a catalytic reaction driven by ATP. The ncAA-acylated tRNA which contains a CUA anticodon, then enters the ribosomal machinery and incorporates the attached ncAA into the effector in response to the complementary amber codon on the effector mRNA (black). Once released from the ribosome, the tRNA can be further reused for ncAA amino-acylation by the cognate synthetase. The full-length polypeptide chain of the effector site-specifically carries the ncAA and undergoes folding and assembly into a functioning effector protein. The newly formed effector is translocated into the host cell through the T3SS. The secreted SPI-2 effectors incorporated with ncAA can be labeled by an externally added fluorophore. (<bold>C</bold>) Reaction scheme of effector labeling with a genetically encoded azide-containing protein. An azide-containing amino acid (AzF) is genetically incorporated into a protein (SifA) and the azido group reacts with a conjugation reagent containing dibenzocyclooctyne (BDP-DBCO) through SPAAC. (<bold>D</bold>) Reaction scheme for the copper-free click reaction with a fluorogenic tetrazine dye. An ncAA with a strained alkene group (e.g. TCO-Lys, as shown here) incorporated into an effector protein (SsaP) reacts with tetrazine‐coupled dyes (SiR-Tz) through SPIEDAC click reaction. Dyes coupled to tetrazine are only fluorescent (magenta) after successful labeling.</p></caption><graphic mime-subtype="tiff" mimetype="image" xlink:href="elife-67789-fig1-v2.tif"/></fig><p>Although GCE has been used for specific labeling of cellular proteins, protein-protein interactions and post-translational studies in <italic>E. coli</italic>, yeast and mammalian cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Lang and Chin, 2014a</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Davis and Chin, 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Chin et al., 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">Lin et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib49">Peng and Hang, 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Ko et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib68">Zhang et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">Lammers et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Hancock et al., 2010</xref>), no study has used GCE for direct visualization of secreted bacterial effector proteins inside host cells. Herein, we report a GCE-based approach for fluorescent labeling and visualization of the secreted effector SifA of <italic>Salmonella enterica</italic> serovar Typhimurium, as well as the substrate specificity switch protein SsaP (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1C–D</xref>). The efficiency and specificity of this labeling strategy is notably affected by the cellular properties of the organic fluorophores. One solution to this problem is to visualize secreted SifA directly by site-specifically introducing a relatively compact fluorescent ncAA (7-(Hydroxy-coumarin-4-yl) ethylglycine, Hco), avoiding the subsequent click reaction. The versatility of the GCE-based labeling approach allowed us to use it in fixed-cells, live-cells, as well as super-resolution imaging of bacterial secreted effectors inside host cells. Using this approach, we observed that SifA was co-localized with LAMP1, the effector SseJ, and the host motor protein kinesin. However, in contrast to SseJ, SifA did not continuously decorate the SIFs, indicating that the stoichiometry of SifA to SseJ was not 1:1. SsaP was labeled and visualized for the first time in bacterial cells. It was localized predominantly at the cell poles, as was the SPI-2 T3SS apparatus (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Chakraborty et al., 2015</xref>). SsaP was secreted into host cells at later times during infection. Finally, we provide evidence of the superiority of labeling by GCE compared to small molecule HA tags. The approach and application described herein is not limited to SifA, SseJ, or SsaP, but is readily applicable to other T3SS effector proteins, as well as to proteins that are not secreted, yet difficult to label.</p></sec><sec id="s2" sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><sec id="s2-1"><title>Engineering and selection of label positions</title><p>Theoretically, an ncAA can be incorporated into any site of a protein of interest. However, in practice, finding a suitable site can be laborious and empirical. Although the incorporation efficiency of an ncAA by an orthogonal tRNA/aminoacyl-tRNA synthetase (tRNA/aaRS) system is influenced by multiple factors, codon context appears to be the most important (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib63">Xu et al., 2016</xref>). The preferred context of orthogonal tRNA is AAT-TAG-ACT, affording the most efficient ncAA incorporation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib63">Xu et al., 2016</xref>). <italic>Salmonella</italic> Typhimurium LT2 contains approximately 452 endogenous TAG stop codons out of 4696 genes, i.e., 9.6% of its genome (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib45">Nakamura et al., 2000</xref>). To the best of our knowledge, only a few SPI-1 genes (SopA) and SPI-2 genes (PipB, PipB2 and SspH2) employ TAG codons. Given that nearly 10% of the genome contains a TAG codon, one would anticipate a certain level of ncAA incorporation at endogenous TAGs, which would lead to spurious dye labeling of other proteins, in addition to labeling of the protein of interest. However, in-gel fluorescence of off-target incorporation into the proteomes of an <italic>E. coli</italic> derivative of BW25993 (where all the TAG codons were mutated to TAA stop codons) was compared with its wild-type parent. Similar levels of ‘off-target’ incorporation in the presence of the orthogonal tRNA and ncAA were observed (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Kipper et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib61">Uttamapinant et al., 2015</xref>). We further circumvent this problem by examining SifA and SsaP under SPI-2-inducing conditions, during which SPI-1 effectors are present at very low (if any) concentrations. Since the tRNA preferred sequence is actually AAT-TAG-ACT (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib63">Xu et al., 2016</xref>), this sequence is absent in the TAG-containing SPI-1 and SPI-2 genes. Lastly, TAG codons tend to be present in genes that are not abundantly expressed (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Kipper et al., 2017</xref>). For all the above reasons, amber suppression and subsequent labeling of off target proteins is quite rare.</p></sec><sec id="s2-2"><title>Site-specific incorporation of labels into SifA and SsaP</title><p>We selected the secreted effector SifA and SsaP for labeling by GCE, because of the past difficulties in labeling (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Gao et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Brumell et al., 2002</xref>). In the case of SsaP, it is a small protein (124 amino acids) and labeling with photoactivatable mCherry (PAmCherry) resulted in a cleaved fusion protein (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s1">Figure 2—figure supplement 1</xref>). The ncAA contains an azide group/ring-strained alkenes (TCO), thus SifA and SsaP can react with the DBCO/Tz-containing dyes by genetically incorporating AzF/TCO*Lys into its permissive sites. We first identified potential amino acid residues that would be optimal candidates for ncAA incorporation into SifA using amino acid conservation analysis with the ConSurf web server (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Ashkenazy et al., 2010</xref>). We chose position 52 in SifA for AzF incorporation based on its low conservation score and the surface accessibility of the selected position was verified from the protein structure (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s2">Figure 2—figure supplement 2</xref>). In the case of SsaP, we engineered the TAG at position 65 to ensure a higher likelihood of labeling (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib63">Xu et al., 2016</xref>), this position was also within a region that had tolerated the insertion of an HA tag (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s3">Figure 2—figure supplement 3</xref>). Expression of either the full-length SifA-E52AzF mutant or SsaP-Y65TCO was dependent on the presence of ncAAs and the corresponding optimal tRNA/aaRS, as evident from SDS-PAGE (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2</xref>).

Secreted SifA-E52AzF was then labeled with BDP-DBCO in HeLa cells using the SPAAC reaction (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4A</xref>). In vitro experiments had been unable to demonstrate an interaction with SifA and SseJ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib46">Ohlson et al., 2008</xref>), although their opposing activities were essential for SIF formation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Gao et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Brumell et al., 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Kolodziejek et al., 2019</xref>). Because of the close proximity of kinesin and SseJ observed previously (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Gao et al., 2018</xref>), we hypothesized that SifA might also be co-localized with SseJ. We used spinning-disk SIM to examine the pattern of SifA and SseJ. They exhibited the same distribution pattern and appeared to be co-localized. In order to confirm their co-localization, we used modified Mander’s colocalization analysis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib40">Manders et al., 1993</xref>) for dense protein patterns (see Materials and methods) and obtained strong evidence for positive co-localization (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4Aiii</xref>).

Therefore, kinesin and SifA should also be co-localized. We performed spinning-disk SIM imaging and investigated the pattern of SifA and kinesin (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4B</xref>). SifA was in close proximity to kinesin. We again employed the modified Mander’s co-localization analysis for dense protein patterns (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib40">Manders et al., 1993</xref>) and obtained additional evidence for positive co-localization (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4Biii</xref>). A mock infection established a background level of SifA-kinesin interaction (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4Biv</xref>). Since SseJ, SifA and kinesin were all co-localized, and SseJ was very sensitive to osmolality-induced pearling effects (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Gao et al., 2018</xref>), these results confirmed that the motor protein kinesin exerts an indirect force on SseJ located on endosomal tubules via a SseJ-SifA-SKIP-kinesin protein complex.

Because microtubules were disrupted by high osmolality fixation, it was proposed that the clusters of SseJ observed in the PFA-fixed cells were not representative of native structures (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Gao et al., 2018</xref>).

A fusion of PAmCherry to the C-terminus of SsaP supported secretion of SseB translocons, but an N-terminal fusion did not.

Although SsaP was expressed at very low levels, there was evidence of its secretion into the HeLa cell cytosol. In order to verify this result, we labeled SsaP using GCE with the fluorogenic dye, SiR-Tz via the SPIEDAC click reaction, to minimize background signals.

The revolution in super-resolution imaging methods have enabled the visualization of virulence factors at unprecedented resolution (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib58">Singh and Kenney, 2021</xref>). However, certain limitations in labeling have prevented a more thorough analysis, as photoactivatable fusion proteins are unable to be translocated through the T3SS pore; the inherent ability of some fusion proteins to cluster can result in clustering artefacts and spurious analysis, and occasionally, the fusion protein is cleaved, as we observed with PAmCherry-SsaP. GCE circumvents all of these limitations, enabling the site-specific labeling of proteins of interest. It also provides an opportunity to visualize proteins that are not abundant, such as SsaP, through the use of newer, brighter fluorophores. Recent advances in understanding the context around the engineered TAG codon (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib63">Xu et al., 2016</xref>) also provides a rapid and relatively low risk ability to label any number of proteins.

Both proteins had been refractive to labeling by other methods. Selective and site-specific labeling of SifA was achieved by genetic incorporation of bioorthogonal ncAAs (AzF and Hco) via GCE technology utilizing an orthogonal aminoacyl-tRNA synthetase/tRNA pairs, and an alternative codon (UAG, amber stop codon). Treatment of AzF-labeled SifA (SifA-E52AzF) with DBCO containing a fluorophore (BDP-DBCO) provided an alternative protein labeling strategy and enabled visualization of translocated SifA effector proteins over many hours after infection of the host. The ability of SifA-E52AzF to induce LAMP1-positive SIFs demonstrates that its function was not impaired by the ncAA tagging strategy and established the presence of SifA within the SIFs (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3</xref>).

Pearling can also be driven by high osmolality (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Gao et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib64">Yanagisawa et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib51">Pullarkat et al., 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Derényi et al., 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib54">Sanborn et al., 2013</xref>), as we observed previously (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Gao et al., 2018</xref>). Kinesin was identified as the motor protein that supplies the force for tubulation, via its interaction with an SseJ-SifA-SKIP tubulating complex (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4</xref>). The observation that SifA was not subject to pearling effects also implies that it is not directly force-dependent. These results lead to a model for membrane tubulation, as depicted in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5s5">Figure 5—figure supplement 5</xref>. When <italic>Salmonella</italic> resides within the SCV, the sensor kinase EnvZ senses the acidic vacuolar environment and drives OmpR-dependent acidification of the bacterial cytoplasm to pH 5.6 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Chakraborty et al., 2015</xref>). Acidification triggers an up-regulation of the SsrA/B two-component system located on SPI-2. DNA binding by SsrB is acid-sensitive and increases by &gt;50%, driving the expression of the SPI-2 T3SS structural genes and effectors (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">Liew et al., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Kenney, 2019</xref>). The kinesin motor interacts with an SseJ-SifA-SKIP protein complex, pulling the vacuolar membrane along microtubules (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5s5">Figure 5—figure supplement 5</xref>) and incorporating LAMP1-positive endosomes into the SIFs. Tubulation is a force-driven process through the concerted action of SseJ-SifA-SKIP-kinesin protein complexes, where force is provided by the motor protein kinesin.</p><p>In summary, we report that genetically encoded unnatural amino acids provide an alternative route to effector protein labeling methodology when conventional methods fail. In addition, we demonstrate the superior labeling and reduced background using GCE compared to immuno-staining (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4C</xref>). We successfully visualized SifA by genetically encoding non-fluorescent, or fluorescent ncAAs without compromising its biological function. While some restrictions such as low ncAA incorporation efficiency and the photophysical limitations of the fluorophore might apply, it is evident that the approach is efficient enough to visualize and localize a secreted effector in host cells, even when it is not very abundant, as was the case with SsaP. Considering the simplicity of the approach and the bioconjugation reaction, we anticipate that straightforward extensions of the technology should provide new and exciting opportunities for imaging and investigation of other effector proteins during infection by bacterial pathogens.</p></sec><sec id="s4" sec-type="materials|methods"><title>Materials and methods</title><sec id="s4-1"><title>Reagents</title><p>4-Azido-L-phenylalanine (AzF), trans-Cyclooct-2-en – L - Lysine (TCO*Lys) and 7-(Hydroxy-coumarin-4-yl) ethylglycine (Hco) were obtained from MedChemExpress, SiChem GmbH and Bachem (Switzerland), respectively.

In this manuscript by Singh et al. authors demonstrate that bioorthogonal labeling using genetic incorporation of unnatural amino acids (UAA) can be used to overcome these challenges. Authors focused on a SifA, a T3SS effector of <italic>Salmonella</italic>, and visualized it in the host cell either by direct site-specific labeling with fluorescence UAA referred to as Hco or by indirect labeling with azide-containing UAA, AzF, that can be further visualized using Click-fluorophores. Using this approach, the authors demonstrated co-localization of secreted SifA with <italic>Salmonella</italic>-induced filaments (SIF) as well as phenotypic heterogeneity of SifA expression within a host cell.</p><p>The idea of using UAA labeling to overcome limitations of fusion proteins is not new, but the fact that this labeling works in situ (when <italic>Salmonella</italic> is inside the host cell vacuole) is exciting and could benefit host-pathogen interactions field. In my opinion, however, some of the manuscript conclusions, as well as broader applicability of this approach, require additional controls related to the labeling specificity and phenotypic consequences of synthetic tRNA/aaRS expression.</p><p>1. While TAG is relatively rare, there are still hundreds of TAG-containing genes, and the tRNA/aaRS expression would result in off-target incorporation of UAA.</p><p>a) how many genes in <italic>Salmonella</italic> contain TAG stop codon? Are there any effector proteins/virulence-related genes among them?</p><p>b) Figure 2A. A full fluorescence imaged gel containing stained lysates of pEVOL strains with either SifA WT and E52TAG need to be provided to demonstrate the extent of off-target labeling</p><p>c) Relevant to all experiments: Because other proteins can be labeled with UAA, the proper control is not cultures without UAA, but a WT SifA strain with pEVOL plasmid supplied with UAA. Only in such case, one can establish that fluorescence signal is specific to SifA and not other proteins (see related comment 3)</p><p>2. The potential of broader applicability of this approach to study host-microbe interaction is one of the selling points of the manuscript. However, it is unclear whether the synthetic system for tRNA/aaRS amber suppression (pEVOL) has negative consequences on virulence. For example, it is known that tRNA/aaRS expression is toxic in <italic>E. coli</italic> and results in growth defect and as well as other phenotypes. The effect of pEVOL plasmids on <italic>Salmonella</italic> on bacterial survival, virulence, timing of events is not established. All experiment are performed by comparing sifA- strain with sifA(52TAG) pEVOL strain, but the WT and WT pEVOL strains are not characterized. If pEVOL alters bacterial growth and survival, it will significantly limit the use of this approach for host-microbe interactions.</p><p>3. The conclusion of phenotypic heterogeneity of SPI-2 is not well-supported. The observed heterogeneity in fluorescence maybe not be physiologically relevant. It may arise as a result of the off-target labeling (see comment 1) or the use of the artificial two-plasmid system (pEVOL and p-sifA). The plasmid copy number varies among cells. In addition, the expression of tRNA/aaRS construct is driven by the leaky expression of arabinose inducible pBAD promoter. This promoter is metabolically regulated, and the expression heterogeneity is well-established in the literature.</p><p><italic>Reviewer #2:</italic></p><p>Due to previous difficulty in localizing the <italic>Salmonella</italic> secreted protein SifA during an infection, the authors employed a new approach by incorporating fluorescent or non-fluorescent unnatural amino acids in SifA via genetic code expansion. Utilizing this strategy, they were able to visualize SifA and showed that it co-localized with LAMP1, SseJ and kinesin on SIFs. In addition, they demonstrated that the T3SS SPI-2 is expressed heterogeneously (only ~16%) within the SCV (<italic>Salmonella</italic> containing vacuole).</p><p>1. Key figures in the paper (e.g. Figures 2 and 5) only show one or a few cells and no statistics were provided.</p><p>2. Previous studies have shown that SifA interacts with kinesin (e.g. Boucrot et al. 205 Science). As a result, demonstrating that SifA co-localizes with kinesin during an infection is confirmatory and provides a limited advance in our understanding of how SIFs form or function.</p><p>3. The authors previously demonstrated that ~30% of the bacterial cells express SPI-2 after acid exposure in vitro (Chakraborty et al. 2015 Plos Biol). Therefore, confirming that only a subpopulation expresses SPI-2 during an infection is also of limited significance.</p><p><italic>Reviewer #3:</italic></p><p>This is an interesting manuscript that nicely applies the application of nonsense codon suppressors that insert unnatural amino acids with reactive or fluorescent properties that allow tagging of bacterial proteins following injection into host cells. Although developed many years ago, the approach of inserting unnatural amino acids into proteins produced by pathogens to monitor their location and interactions within host cells is a wonderful addition to the toolkit for visualizing virulence factors, and will stimulate many other applications.</p><p>The authors make a strong argument for problems with previously used visualization methods, including use of bulky protein-tags or immunological approaches. Overall the concept, methodology, data, and images provide compelling evidence for the localization of SifA and the interactions of SifA with SseJ, SKIP, and kinesin in vivo without the use of approaches that are prone to artifacts.</p><p>I have a few questions and comments that are probably minor, but addressing these points will make the manuscript clearer.</p><p>1. UAA is an abbreviation for a nonsense codon. As the approach used to insert unnatural amino acids is based upon suppression of another nonsense codon, UAG, it is confusing to use &quot;UAA&quot; as an abbreviation for &quot;unnatural amino acids&quot;. Something like u-AA or an alternative be better.</p><p>2. The initial sentences for two of the paragraphs of the Results section are redundant with the Introduction. Deletion of these redundancies would improve the readability of the manuscript. Lines 102-104 &quot;Currently.… (See Introduction).&quot;; and lines 123-125 &quot;Intracellular.… (14-16).&quot;</p><p>3. Note that an important point of this manuscript expressed on line 254 is that the results are based upon &quot;native levels of protein expression&quot;. However, the proteins are expressed from the plasmid psifA52TAG, and the copy number of the plasmids are not indicated either in the text or in the Methods. As an important point of the manuscript, the reader should not have to go back to the original references to figure out the copy number of the plasmids or how the protein is expressed from the plasmid.</p><p>4. Isn't a caveat of the conclusion that this process is &quot;bistable&quot; dependent upon all of the <italic>Salmonella</italic> properly expressing SifA from the plasmid? Do you know that none of the <italic>Salmonella</italic> lost the plasmid during the subculture step described in line 322?</p><p>[Editors’ note: further revisions were suggested prior to acceptance, as described below.]</p><p>Thank you for submitting your article &quot;Genetic code expansion enables visualization of <italic>Salmonella</italic> type three secretion system components and secreted effectors&quot; for consideration by <italic>eLife</italic>.

The following individual involved in review of your submission has agreed to reveal their identity: Kelly Hughes (Reviewer #2).</p><p>The reviewers have discussed their reviews with one another, and the Reviewing Editor has drafted this to help you prepare a revised submission.</p><p>Essential revisions:</p><p>In addition to the revisions for clarity suggested by reviewer 2, please pay special attention to the request for the addition of statistical analysis to figures containing micrographs and a higher resolution image for Figure S13 as requested by reviewer 1. The addition of statistical analysis was a primary request of previous reviewers and was not addressed in the revised manuscript. While the current reviewers appreciate that the selected images represent hundreds of data points, statistics are necessary to provide insight into specifically how well &quot;representative images&quot; reflect the entire data landscape. Statistical analysis of micrograph data is standard practice and should not be too onerous. Please see note regarding the explanation of statistical analysis at the end of this email under &quot;Information to help as you revise your submission&quot; for more details.</p><p><italic>Reviewer #1:</italic></p><p>The authors have done a good job of responding to the majority of the reviewers' comments.</p><p>1. I do not think the authors adequately responded to the request for statistical data made by previous reviewers.</p><p>2. The data in Figure S13 showing that SsaP was mostly localized to the poles during early infection times is low resolution and not particularly convincing. Please replace with a higher resolution image and include statistical data on the fraction of cells with polar localization.</p><p><italic>Reviewer #2:</italic></p><p>The manuscript investigates the characterization by super-resolution fluorescence microscopy <italic>Salmonella</italic>-induced filament formation following engulfment by host cells and the role of SsaP in the <italic>Salmonella</italic> pathogenicity island 2 (SPI2) secretion-specificity switch from injectisome structure and assembly components to translocon and effector protein secretion. This work focuses on the SifA and SseJ effectors, which catalyzes the formation of <italic>Salmonella</italic> induced filaments. This is significant because in all type III secretion (T3S) systems characterized, the SsaP homologs act as molecular rulers to measure either injectisome length in the injectisome T3S systems or hook length in the flagellar T3S systems. The size of SsaP strongly argues against it acting as a ruler. The SsaP homologs include an ~300 N-terminal domain, which includes the T3S signal for export and the conserved, ~100 amino acid T3S4 domain described by Agrain et al. 2005, which catalyzes the T3S-specificity switch. SsaP at 124 amino acids in length contains the conserved T3S4 domain and whether or not SsaP secretion is required for the T3S-specificity switch is not known. Regardless, SsaP is unique among the T3S-specificity switch homologs making it a subject of great interest with the potential for unique mechanisms of action.</p><p>Overall, this represents a real tour-de-force and a significant contribution in understanding the SPI-2 mechanism of SIF formation and the role of SsaP in the secretion-specificity switch. The authors addressed the three original reviewers' concerns fully.</p><p>The Results section &quot;Engineering and selection of label positions&quot; should be retitled. It's a logical discussion for the methods used in this study. The authors make very good arguments as to why, under SPI2 inducing conditions, ncAA labeling of SifA and SsaP should work, and later they show it does. I just can't think of the title I would rather see (not helpful).</p><p>The second chapter of the Results section covers the GCE labeling. Unfortunately, the SsaP-mCherry fusion was cleaved. It's not unusual for this to occur with fusion proteins, but it does make life more difficult. The TAG at position 52 of SsaP, logically chosen, was successfully labeled as was SifA. Figure 2 clearly shows successful labeling of both proteins.</p><p>The third chapter demonstrates only a slight detrimental effect of the pEVOL – this must be an amber suppression plasmid, but it's not defined – on <italic>Salmonella</italic> pathogenesis. In general, when one compares a WT to a plasmid expression system the better control is the plasmid vector only control.</p><p>The fourth chapter demonstrates the complementation of the sifA deletion by engineered SifA-E52AzF – nice. Figure 3 imaging is spectacular.</p><p>Chapter 5 describes the fluorescence imaging of SifA-E52AzF. With appropriate controls the authors could visualize SifA within the filaments. This demonstrates that AzF labeling can clearly detect and visualize secreted effector protein.</p><p>Chapter 6 describes co-localization studies. SifA co-localizes with LAMP1. SifA, SseJ and kinesin co-localize. The controls are well done.</p><p>The next chapter (7) demonstrates that unlike SseJ, which forms continuous filaments, SifA shows punctate labeling.</p><p>Chapter 8 confirms SifA labeling at E52 with Hco behaves similar to the same with Azf.</p><p>In Chapter 9 we see a comparison of GCE-based labeling to antibody labeling that shows that GCE-based labeling is superior.</p><p>In Chapter 10 we get to SsaP. As one would predict from loss of a secretion-specificity switch protein, loss of SsaP was defective in effector secretion. SseB translocon was not secreted in the absence of SsaP indicating the switch occurs after needle completion and before translocon assembly. C-terminal fusion of mCherry to SsaP resulted in a functional SsaP, whereas an N-terminal fusion did not. This is consistent with what is observed with similar fusions to other T3SS SsaP homologs – except the SsaP-mCherry fusion is not stable and the mCherry domain is cleaved. This was circumvented with HA-tag insertions that produced functional SsaP-HA tagged derivatives. To verify that HA-SsaP was secreted into the HeLa cell cytosol, SsaP was labeled at position 65 with TCO*Lys, shown to be functional. Figure 5 does suggest that SsaP is secreted. There are very few molecules of SsaP representing a significant achievement in visualization studies.</p></body></sub-article><sub-article article-type="reply" id="sa2"><front-stub><article-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.67789.sa2</article-id><title-group><article-title>Author response</article-title></title-group></front-stub><body><p>[Editors’ note: the authors resubmitted a revised version of the paper for consideration.

Are there any effector proteins/virulence-related genes among them?</p></disp-quote><p>We thank the reviewer for raising this excellent point that we had neglected to include in the manuscript. <italic>Salmonella</italic> Typhimurium (LT2) contains ~452 endogenous TAG stop codons out of 4696 genes. This means that 9.6% of its genome uses the TAG termination codon. Among them, there is one gene in the SPI-1 regulon (SopA) and 3 genes in SPI-2 (PipB, PipB2 and SspH2) that use TAG. Given this nearly 10%, one would anticipate a certain level of UAA (ncAA) incorporation at endogenous TAGs, which would lead to spurious dye labeling of other proteins in addition to the labeling of the protein of interest. However, given we are examining SifA under SPI-2 inducing conditions, we would expect that SPI-1 effectors to be present at very low (if any) concentrations. What about the other ancestral genes?</p><p>There are several important points to make in addressing this point:</p><p>1. It turns out that the position of the amino acid in the primary sequence and the neighboring base pairs in the mRNA influence the efficiency of amber suppression and thus ncAA incorporation [<italic>Chembiochem</italic>. 2016, 17, 1250-1256; <italic>Curr Opin Chem Biol.</italic> 2018, 46,146-155]; therefore, both the design of the TAG mutation, as well as its position is important. We have included sentences to this effect in the revised manuscript (see lines 143-165 and Figure 2).</p><p>2. It turns out that off-target labelling is really not a problem. Others engineered <italic>E. coli</italic> so that no other TAG codons were present except for one that was engineered in <italic>ompC</italic>, and surprisingly, off target labelling was not noticeably different in the engineered strain compared to a WT, non-recoded strain [<italic>ACS Synth Biol.</italic> 2017, 6, 233]. The authors speculated that either endogenous TAG codons are inefficiently decoded by the ncAA-pEVOL (in our case AzF-pEVOL), or the products are degraded. We basically see the same thing (see point 3). We now add a paragraph that deals with this issue (lines 155-159).</p><p>3. We evaluated the specificity of ncAA incorporation and labelling by constructing a GFP-fusion to SifA so that we could compare GFP fluorescence with fluorescence labelling at the 52-TAG position by Alexa 555. You can see in the first row of figures that the WT SifA-GFP is clearly visible, but when the 52-TAG-GFP construct is examined, in the absence of ncAA, there is no GFP (dark panel, right), because the stop codon truncates and no GFP is produced. In the second row, we add ncAA (AzF + pEVOL) to the WT SifA and examine Alexa555 and there is no labelling, because there is no position for labelling in the WT SifA construct. If off target labelling were significant, it would be visible in this field, but there is no signal and essentially no background. Similarly, with the 52-TAG-GFP construct, there is no background when there is no AzF added. Finally, when we examine 52-TAG-GFP and add AzF + pEVOL, (third row), there is a substantial GFP signal (as the amber is suppressed) and 52-TAG is labelled by AzF, as apparent by red fluorescence. Note that there is also really strong agreement with the red and the green fluorescence in the two panels. Thus, off target labelling does not contribute to the signal that we observe. This figure and a discussion about the findings are now included in the revised manuscript (lines 189-198, Figure 2—figure supplement 4).</p><p>4. Lastly, TAG stop codons are predominantly found in genes expressed at low levels [JBC 2014, 289, 30334-30342], so if present, they would be less visible.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>b) Figure 2A.

Soc.</italic> 2015,137,4602-4605], while others show incorporation into a small subset of TAG terminating genes that are only detectable in RF1 knockout strains [<italic>Nat. Chem. Biol.</italic> 2011, 7, 779-786; <italic>Science,</italic> 2013, 342, 357-360, 35; <italic>Sci. Rep.</italic> 2015, 5. 9699]. In figure 2A, SDS gels were run directly from the click reaction mixture without further washing the excess dye. We observed a few very low-level background fluorescence in figure 2A possibly because of a non-specific attachment of free dye molecules to cell proteins.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>c) Relevant to all experiments: Because other proteins can be labeled with UAA, the proper control is not cultures without UAA, but a WT SifA strain with pEVOL plasmid supplied with UAA. Only in such case, one can establish that fluorescence signal is specific to SifA and not other proteins (see related comment 3)</p></disp-quote><p>We thank the reviewer for pointing out the missing information. To establish that the fluorescence signal observed in the host cell is specific to secreted SifA only, we infected HeLa cells with wild-type <italic>Salmonella</italic> in the presence of pEVOL and ncAA. To visualize if any ncAA incorporated effectors secreted into host cells, HeLa cells were treated with BDP dye as described in the methods. After labeling, excess dye was washed out and cells were fixed with 4% PFA and immunostained for SseJ after 16 h post-infection. The fluorescence microscopy image shows the absence of intracellular fluorescent signals in the green channel, and non-specific fluorescence signals were nearly absent. We have included this results in the revised manuscript (see line 228-240; <italic>SI Appendix</italic> Figure S7).</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>2. The potential of broader applicability of this approach to study host-microbe interaction is one of the selling points of the manuscript.</p></disp-quote><p>We agree! And we think it is even stronger now.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>However, it is unclear whether the synthetic system for tRNA/aaRS amber suppression (pEVOL) has negative consequences on virulence. For example, it is known that tRNA/aaRS expression is toxic in E. coli and results in growth defect and as well as other phenotypes. The effect of pEVOL plasmids on <italic>Salmonella</italic> on bacterial survival, virulence, timing of events is not established. All experiment are performed by comparing sifA- strain with sifA(52TAG) pEVOL strain, but the WT and WT pEVOL strains are not characterized. If pEVOL alters bacterial growth and survival, it will significantly limit the use of this approach for host-microbe interactions.</p></disp-quote><p>The reviewer raises an excellent point here. Although high suppression efficiency was achieved with the amber stop codon, no significant adverse effects on bacterial growth could be observed in <italic>E. coli</italic> with 7–8% of genes terminating in TAG [<italic>Nat. Chem. Biol.,</italic> 2017, 13, 446-450; <italic>ACS Synth Biol.</italic> 2017, 6, 233], nor did it change the growth rate in <italic>Synechococcus elongatus</italic> with 40% of genes terminating in TAG [Biochemistry, 2017, 56,2161- 2165]. Nonetheless, to examine the consequence of orthogonal amber suppression (pEVOL), we addressed this point in two ways, we first performed a simple growth curve comparing the WT strain +/- pEVOL (<italic>SI Appendix</italic> Figure S5A). Next, we examined the effect of pEVOL on virulence by infecting HeLa cells with WT +/-pEVOL and enumerating intracellular bacteria at 2 and 16h post-infection. The results indicated that there was a slight reduction in the intracellular replication (74% compared to no plasmid at 100%). Together, these results suggest that orthogonal tRNA/aaRS amber suppression (pEVOL) system has no negative consequences on the pathogenesis of <italic>Salmonella</italic>. (see lines 199-209 and <italic>SI Appendix,</italic> Figure S5A, B).</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>3. The conclusion of phenotypic heterogeneity of SPI-2 is not well-supported. The observed heterogeneity in fluorescence maybe not be physiologically relevant. It may arise as a result of the off-target labeling (see comment 1) or the use of the artificial two-plasmid system (pEVOL and p-sifA). The plasmid copy number varies among cells. In addition, the expression of tRNA/aaRS construct is driven by the leaky expression of arabinose inducible pBAD promoter. This promoter is metabolically regulated, and the expression heterogeneity is well-established in the literature.</p></disp-quote><p>We strongly disagree with the reviewer on this point of SPI-2 heterogeneity, however we do agree about the problems of using pBAD. Previous in vitro studies [Chakraborty et al. 2015 Plos. Biol.] from our lab have demonstrated the heterogeneity, but that is not the focus of this manuscript, so we have removed this section.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Reviewer #2:</p><p>Due to previous difficulty in localizing the <italic>Salmonella</italic> secreted protein SifA during an infection, the authors employed a new approach by incorporating fluorescent or non-fluorescent unnatural amino acids in SifA via genetic code expansion. Utilizing this strategy, they were able to visualize SifA and showed that it co-localized with LAMP1, SseJ and kinesin on SIFs. In addition, they demonstrated that the T3SS SPI-2 is expressed heterogeneously (only ~16%) within the SCV (<italic>Salmonella</italic> containing vacuole).</p><p>1. Key figures in the paper (e.g. Figures 2 and 5) only show one or a few cells and no statistics were provided.</p></disp-quote><p>Representative images are shown from many tens of infections we have performed. We now state: Infections were performed tens of times, hundreds of cells were imaged per infection and the figures display representative images in the Methods and reiterate this fact in the figure legends. Figure 5 is now Figure 4 in the revised manuscript and the number of cells used for analysis is in the legend.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>2. Previous studies have shown that SifA interacts with kinesin (e.g. Boucrot et al. 205 Science). As a result, demonstrating that SifA co-localizes with kinesin during an infection is confirmatory and provides a limited advance in our understanding of how SIFs form or function.</p></disp-quote><p>It is disappointing to us that the reviewer failed to see the importance of the labelling and the application of the method. In my conversations with colleagues, many of them have tried (and failed!) to use GCE to site-specifically label their virulence factors in a number of pathogens. We succeeded in labeling SifA, which was intractable to labeling by other approaches. The focus of the manuscript was not on revealing new aspects of the Sifs, although we did discover that while SseJ is continuously labelled along the Sifs and subject to fixation artifacts [Gao et al., mBio 2018], SifA labelling is punctate, independent of the fixation method. This result means that SifA is not directly force-dependent and the stoichiometry is not 1:1 SifA to SseJ. However, the real point was to show that we could label a protein using GCE that we had been unable to label by other means. The revised manuscript further emphasizes the utility of the approach by labelling another protein (SsaP) that was also impossible to label by constructing fusion proteins, since the fusion protein was cleaved (see <italic>SI Appendix,</italic> Figure S1). We provide new information that demonstrates the importance of SsaP in virulence and show for the first time that it is secreted during infection (<italic>SI Appendix,</italic> Figure S1, S2, S10-11 and revised manuscript Figure 5).</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>3. The authors previously demonstrated that ~30% of the bacterial cells express SPI-2 after acid exposure in vitro (Chakraborty et al. 2015 Plos Biol). Therefore, confirming that only a subpopulation expresses SPI-2 during an infection is also of limited significance.</p></disp-quote><p>We respectfully disagree with the reviewer on this point, Chakraborty et al. 2015 only showed in vitro heterogeneity and we think it is important to establish the presence of cheaters in the vacuole. However, we eliminated this section based on the criticism</p><p>from the other reviewers (point #3, above).</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Reviewer #3:</p><p>This is an interesting manuscript that nicely applies the application of nonsense codon suppressors that insert unnatural amino acids with reactive or fluorescent properties that allow tagging of bacterial proteins following injection into host cells. Although developed many years ago, the approach of inserting unnatural amino acids into proteins produced by pathogens to monitor their location and interactions within host cells is a wonderful addition to the toolkit for visualizing virulence factors, and will stimulate many other applications.</p><p>The authors make a strong argument for problems with previously used visualization methods, including use of bulky protein-tags or immunological approaches. Overall the concept, methodology, data, and images provide compelling evidence for the localization of SifA and the interactions of SifA with SseJ, SKIP, and kinesin in vivo without the use of approaches that are prone to artifacts.</p><p>I have a few questions and comments that are probably minor, but addressing these points will make the manuscript clearer.</p><p>1. UAA is an abbreviation for a nonsense codon. As the approach used to insert unnatural amino acids is based upon suppression of another nonsense codon, UAG, it is confusing to use &quot;UAA&quot; as an abbreviation for &quot;unnatural amino acids&quot;. Something like u-AA or an alternative be better.</p></disp-quote><p>Ok. We have modified UAA to ncAA throughout the manuscript.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>2. The initial sentences for two of the paragraphs of the Results section are redundant with the Introduction. Deletion of these redundancies would improve the readability of the manuscript.

Note that an important point of this manuscript expressed on line 254 is that the results are based upon &quot;native levels of protein expression&quot;. However, the proteins are expressed from the plasmid psifA52TAG, and the copy number of the plasmids are not indicated either in the text or in the Methods. As an important point of the manuscript, the reader should not have to go back to the original references to figure out the copy number of the plasmids or how the protein is expressed from the plasmid.</p></disp-quote><p>We now include this information in the Methods and note that <italic>sifA</italic> is expressed behind its native promoter.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>4.
