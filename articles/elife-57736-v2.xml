active genes protects these loci from replication stress. Here, we report that the lysine acetyltransferases 2A and 2B (KAT2A/2B, also called GCN5/PCAF), two well-known transcriptional regulators, acetylate a cluster of seven lysine residues (7K-patch) within the PALB2 chromatin association motif (ChAM) and, in this way, regulate context-dependent PALB2 binding to chromatin. In unperturbed cells, the 7K-patch is targeted for KAT2A/2B-mediated acetylation, which in turn enhances the direct association of PALB2 with nucleosomes. Importantly, DNA damage triggers a rapid deacetylation of ChAM and increases the overall mobility of PALB2. Distinct missense mutations of the 7K-patch render the mode of PALB2 chromatin binding, making it either unstably chromatin-bound (7Q) or randomly bound with a reduced capacity for mobilisation (7R). Significantly, both of these mutations confer a deficiency in RAD51 foci formation and increase DNA damage in S phase, leading to the reduction of overall cell survival. Thus, our study reveals that acetylation of the ChAM 7K-patch acts as a molecular switch to enable dynamic PALB2 shuttling for HR repair while protecting active genes during DNA replication.</p></abstract><kwd-group kwd-group-type="author-keywords"><kwd>PALB2</kwd><kwd>acetylation</kwd><kwd>chromatin</kwd><kwd>KAT2</kwd><kwd>DNA repair</kwd><kwd>genome stability</kwd></kwd-group><kwd-group kwd-group-type="research-organism"><title>Research organism</title><kwd>Human</kwd></kwd-group><funding-group><award-group id="fund1"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100004440</institution-id><institution>Wellcome Trust</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>101009/Z/13/Z</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Esashi</surname><given-names>Fumiko</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund2"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100010663</institution-id><institution>H2020 European Research Council</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>ERC-2013-340551</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Tora</surname><given-names>László</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund3"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution>Edward P Abraham Research Fund</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>RF 260</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Esashi</surname><given-names>Fumiko</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund4"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100000024</institution-id><institution>Canadian Institutes of Health Research</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>FDN-388879</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Masson</surname><given-names>Jean-Yves</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund5"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100000265</institution-id><institution>Medical Research Council</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>MR/W017601</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Esashi</surname><given-names>Fumiko</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund6"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution>Edward P Abraham Research Fund</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>RF 282</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Esashi</surname><given-names>Fumiko</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund7"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100001804</institution-id><institution>Canada Research Chairs</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>Tier I Canada Research Chair in DNA repair and cancer therapeutics</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Masson</surname><given-names>Jean-Yves</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund8"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100010438</institution-id><institution>Francis Crick Institute</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Smerdon</surname><given-names>Stephen J</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund9"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100000781</institution-id><institution>European Research Council</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>Advanced Grant ERC-2013–340551 Birtoaction</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Tora</surname><given-names>László</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><funding-statement>The funders had no role in study design, data collection and interpretation, or the decision to submit the work for publication.

Biallelic mutations in <italic>PALB2</italic> cause Fanconi anaemia (FA), a rare genetic disorder characterised by bone marrow failure, developmental abnormalities, and an increased incidence of childhood cancers (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">Reid et al., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib45">Xia et al., 2007</xref>). Hereditary monoallelic <italic>PALB2</italic> mutations also increase the risk of breast and pancreatic cancer (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Jones et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Rahman et al., 2007</xref>), similarly to inherited <italic>BRCA1</italic> and <italic>BRCA2</italic> mutations (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">ODonovan and Livingston, 2010</xref>). The physiological importance of PALB2 is further highlighted by the recent large-scale functional analysis of PALB2 mutations in cancer patients (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Boonen et al., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">Rodrigue et al., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib43">Wiltshire et al., 2020</xref>). Canonically, PALB2 works together with BRCA1 and BRCA2 to promote error-free repair of highly genotoxic double-strand DNA breaks (DSBs) by homologous recombination (HR) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Ducy et al., 2019</xref>). In this process, BRCA1 acts as a DNA damage sensor, which in turn recruits PALB2 and BRCA2 to sites of DNA damage. Subsequently, the essential RAD51 recombinase is recruited to form nucleoprotein filaments, which catalyse the strand invasion and homology search phases of HR repair (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">Sy et al., 2009b</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib44">Xia et al., 2006</xref>).</p><p>Besides the role of PALB2 in promoting HR, our recent study revealed a repair-independent role of PALB2 in protecting transcriptionally active chromatin during DNA replication (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Bleuyard et al., 2017b</xref>). This role of PALB2 is mediated through its high-affinity binding partner the MORF-related gene on chromosome 15 protein (MRG15), which recognises an epigenetic marker of active genes, histone H3 trimethylated at lysine 36 (H3K36me<sup>3</sup>), via its N-terminal chromodomain (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Bleuyard et al., 2017b</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Hayakawa et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">Sy et al., 2009a</xref>). Moreover, PALB2 intrinsic chromatin association is reinforced by its chromatin-association motif (ChAM), an evolutionarily conserved domain uniquely found in PALB2 orthologues, which directly binds to nucleosomes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Bleuyard et al., 2012</xref>). Notably, our genome-wide chromatin immunoprecipitation coupled to high-throughput sequencing (ChIP-seq) analyses revealed that PALB2 associates with a small fraction of actively transcribed genes. Notably, locus-specific analyses through ChIP followed by quantitative PCR (ChIP-qPCR) showed a decrease in PALB2 association with these genes upon exposure to an inhibitor of DNA topoisomerase I (TOP1), camptothecin (CPT), suggesting that the mode of PALB2 chromatin association is actively regulated (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Bleuyard et al., 2017b</xref>). Despite these observations, the regulatory mechanism by which PALB2 switches between different modes of chromatin association (i.e. damage-induced association to promote HR repair versus steady-state association to protect active genes during DNA replication) remains unclear.</p><p>Numerous studies in recent decades have provided evidence that reversible post-translational modifications (PTMs), such as phosphorylation, ubiquitylation, SUMOylation, poly(ADP-ribosyl)ation, methylation, and acetylation, are orchestrated to promote genome stability, including the DNA damage response (DDR) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Dantuma and van Attikum, 2016</xref>). For example, the damage-responsive ATM and ATR kinases mediate phosphorylation of PALB2 at residues S59, S177, and S376, which in turn facilitates PALB2 interaction with BRCA1, RAD51 foci formation, and hence HR repair of DSBs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Ahlskog et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Buisson et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Guo et al., 2015</xref>). Conversely, in G1, the E3 ligase KEAP1-CUL3-RBX1 ubiquitylates PALB2 at K25, a key residue involved in BRCA1 interaction and, in this way, suppresses PALB2-BRCA1 interaction and HR activation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Orthwein et al., 2015</xref>). Furthermore, our recent work identified PALB2 as a key substrate of the lysine acetyltransferases 2A (KAT2A/GCN5) and 2B (KAT2B/PCAF) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Fournier et al., 2016</xref>), two well-known transcriptional regulators (reviewed in <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Nagy et al., 2010</xref>), in undamaged cells. However, the physiological role of these acetylation events is as yet unknown. Notably, KAT2A/2B use the metabolite acetyl coenzyme A (acetyl-CoA) as a cofactor (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib40">Tanner et al., 2000</xref>), and hence are proposed to fine-tune cellular processes in accordance with the metabolic status of the cell (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib42">Wellen et al., 2009</xref>). Therefore, an understanding of the functional significance of PALB2 acetylation would have important implications in the context of tumorigenesis, as cancer cells frequently exhibit reprogrammed metabolism and elevated genome instability (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Fouad and Aanei, 2017</xref>).</p><p>In this study, we investigated the role of KAT2A/2B-mediated lysine acetylation in regulating PALB2. We found that KAT2A/2B acetylate a cluster of seven lysine residues (the 7K-patch) within the PALB2 ChAM. ChAM acetylation enhanced its direct association with nucleosomes. Notably, DNA damage triggered rapid ChAM deacetylation and increased the mobility of PALB2. Importantly, lysine to glutamine (Q) or arginine (R) substitutions in the 7K-patch rendered PALB2 either constitutively unbound or non-specifically chromatin-bound, resulting in impaired RAD51 foci formation in S phase and reduced cell survival. On the basis of these observations, we propose that PALB2 chromatin association is dynamically regulated by KAT2A/2B in a context-dependent manner, which plays a significant role in the maintenance of genome stability.</p></sec><sec id="s2" sec-type="materials|methods"><title>Materials and methods</title><sec id="s2-1"><title>Cell culture and cell lines</title><p>All cells were grown at 37 °C in an incubator with a humidified atmosphere with 5% CO<sub>2</sub>.

K to Q substitutions nullify the positive charge of the lysine side chains and are therefore commonly considered to mimic acetyl-lysine, albeit with a reduction in the side chain size (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s2">Figure 2—figure supplement 2A</xref>). Conversely, K to R substitution maintains a positive charge but is unable to accept acetylation and, hence, is widely considered to mimic constitutively non-acetyl-lysine, albeit with an increase in the side chain size (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s2">Figure 2—figure supplement 2A</xref>). Our in silico AlphaFold2 modelling suggest that ChAM has a propensity to form an alpha-helical structures with a less defined C-terminal section, potentially allowing it to explore a spectrum of structural configurations for optimum nucleosome binding (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s2">Figure 2—figure supplement 2B</xref>).

Markedly, nucleosome pull-down assays revealed clear nucleosome binding by acetylated ChAM peptides, but not by their non-acetylated counterpart, where salmon sperm DNA was provided in excess to outcompete ChAM electrostatic interaction with DNA (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3B</xref>). This effect was readily detectable with the ChAM peptide containing a mono-acetylation at K438, which was detected in our original MS study of the endogenous HeLa KAT2A/2B-acetylome (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Fournier et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figures 1A, C, D ,</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">3A</xref>, highlighted in blue).

To evaluate the impact of native PALB2 acetylation, we down-regulated KAT2A/2B activity using siRNA and assessed PALB2 mobility as a surrogate measure of its chromatin association. To this end, a tandem FLAG- and EGFP-tagged full-length wild-type (WT) PALB2 (FE-PALB2) was conditionally expressed in a U2OS cell line in which endogenous <italic>PALB2</italic> was down-regulated by a doxycycline-inducible short hairpin RNA (U2OS-shPALB2) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s1">Figure 3—figure supplement 1A</xref>), and the mobility of FE-PALB2 was assessed using fluorescence recovery after photobleaching (FRAP). This analysis revealed that KAT2A/2B siRNA treatment led to an increase in FE-PALB2 diffusion rate (reduced FRAP t<sub>1/2</sub>; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3C and D</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s1">Figure 3—figure supplement 1B and C</xref><italic>,</italic> <xref ref-type="video" rid="fig3video1 fig3video2">Figure 3—videos 1; 2</xref>), concomitant with reduced levels of global acetylation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Fournier et al., 2016</xref>). Conversely, the inhibition of lysine deacetylases (KDAC), which increased the global lysine acetylation levels, decreased the diffusion rate of FE-PALB2 (increased FRAP t<sub>1/2</sub>; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3E and F</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s1">Figure 3—figure supplement 1D and E</xref><italic>,</italic> <xref ref-type="video" rid="fig3video3 fig3video4">Figure 3—videos 3 and 4</xref>). It is noteworthy that hyper-acetylation of histones promotes chromatin relaxation, which can increase the local mobility of chromatin. Hence, the reduced PALB2 mobility in cells treated with KDAC inhibitors suggests that PALB2 chromatin association is stimulated by lysine acetylation.</p></sec><sec id="s3-5"><title>DNA damage triggers ChAM deacetylation and increases PALB2 mobility</title><p>Our observations above indicate that PALB2 acetylation promotes its association with nucleosomes/chromatin, thereby restricting its mobility (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4A</xref>). However, static PALB2 chromatin association could be toxic to cells when DSBs at random locations need to be recognised by the repair complex. Hence, we hypothesised that ChAM acetylation might be dynamically controlled upon stochastic DNA damage, such that PALB2 can be mobilised. Indeed, in HEK293 cells exposed to ionizing radiation (IR), rapid deacetylation of the ChAM fragment was detected at 15 min and persisted for at least 2 hr (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4B and C</xref>). Furthermore, FRAP analyses of full-length FE-PALB2 in U2OS cells revealed a clear increase in the diffusion rate following IR treatment, decreasing FRAP t<sub>1/2</sub> by 22% compared to control conditions (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4D and E</xref><italic>,</italic> <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s1">Figure 4—figure supplement 1A-C</xref>, <xref ref-type="video" rid="fig4video1 fig4video2">Figure 4—videos 1 and 2</xref>).

Since PALB2 mobility is suppressed when lysine acetylation is up-regulated (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3E and F</xref>), it is unlikely that the damage-induced increase of PALB2 mobility is associated with chromatin relaxation caused by histone acetylation, an event which is observed upon DNA damage (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib49">Ziv et al., 2006</xref>).

This allows PALB2 to interact with damage sensors, such as BRCA1, which in turn recruits the entire HR complex to sites of DNA damage. ChAM binding to naked DNA through the deacetylated 7K-patch may promote RAD51 loading and HR repair. The constitutively highly mobile PALB2 variant (7Q) is efficiently recruited to sites of DNA damage but, unlike WT PALB2, unable to promote efficient RAD51 foci formation. The randomly chromatin-bound and less capably mobilised PALB2 variant (7R) is inefficiently recruited to sites of DNA damage and hence fails to promote HR.</p><p><supplementary-material id="fig9sdata1"><label>Figure 9—source data 1.</label><caption><title>Numerical data for <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig9">Figure 9B</xref><bold><italic>.</italic></bold></title></caption><media mimetype="application" mime-subtype="xlsx" xlink:href="elife-57736-fig9-data1-v2.xlsx"/></supplementary-material></p><p><supplementary-material id="fig9sdata2"><label>Figure 9—source data 2.</label><caption><title>Numerical data for <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig9">Figure 9D</xref><bold><italic>.</italic></bold></title></caption><media mimetype="application" mime-subtype="xlsx" xlink:href="elife-57736-fig9-data2-v2.xlsx"/></supplementary-material></p></caption><graphic mimetype="image" mime-subtype="tiff" xlink:href="elife-57736-fig9-v2.tif"/></fig><fig id="fig9s1" position="float" specific-use="child-fig"><label>Figure 9—figure supplement 1.</label><caption><title>Summary of ChAM properties and post-translational modifications.</title><p>Residues targeted for phosphorylation and acetylation within ChAM and its vicinity are indicated below the depiction of the ChAM domain.

It is widely described that transcriptionally active loci are vulnerable to DNA damage during DNA replication, particularly when challenged by genotoxic reagents that stabilise RNA:DNA hybrids, such as camptothecin (CPT) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Marinello et al., 2013</xref>). In undamaged cells, WT PALB2 is enriched at a small subset of, but not all, H3K36me<sup>3</sup> marked active genes, which in turn prevents CPT-induced DNA damage at these loci (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Bleuyard et al., 2017a</xref>). We therefore asked whether the PALB2 7K-patch affects its occupancy at these previously identified PALB2-bound loci. Indeed, our ChIP-qPCR analyses revealed significant impairments of PALB2 7R and 7Q occupancies at these loci, namely the <italic>ACTB, TCOF1</italic> and <italic>WEE1</italic> genes (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig9">Figure 9C and D</xref>). These observations are in line with the view that the 7Q substitutions impede overall chromatin association, while 7R substitutions elicit sparse and non-specific chromatin association, limiting PALB2 enrichment at these loci. It is important to note, however, that reduced PALB2 association at these loci per se does not confer DNA damage in cis unless cells are challenged by CPT (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Bleuyard et al., 2017a</xref>). Hence, this did not fully explain the increase of γ−H2A.X in cells expressing the 7Q or 7R variant in unperturbed conditions as shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8">Figure 8E</xref>.</p><p>We postulated that, even in unperturbed cells, spontaneous DNA lesions may be induced at any locations of genomic DNA due to naturally occurring genotoxic metabolites, such as reactive oxygen species, and be processed to DSBs when encountered by the DNA replication machinery. In this scenario, the mobility of PALB2 would be important for the repair of these randomly distributed DSBs, as it is following exposure to IR. Indeed, our ChIP-qPCR assessment of PALB2 occupancy at the known PALB2-bound loci revealed that the occupancy of PALB2 WT at active genes was dramatically reduced upon IR exposure to levels equivalent to those of the untreated 7Q or 7R mutant (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig9">Figure 9D</xref>). Together, these observations indicate that the 7Q or 7R variants are defective for HR repair of randomly induced DNA damage outside of active genes.</p></sec></sec><sec id="s4" sec-type="discussion"><title>Discussion</title><p>In this study, we have demonstrated that reversible lysine acetylation controls the mode of PALB2 chromatin association, fine-tuning RAD51 recruitment during S phase. Taking all our findings collectively, we propose the following model (illustrated in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig9">Figure 9E</xref>): (1) KAT2A/2B-mediated ChAM acetylation, jointly with MRG15, governs PALB2 enrichment at undamaged, transcriptionally active chromatin; (2) global DNA damage signalling triggers ChAM deacetylation, which in turn releases PALB2 from active genes; (3) in this way, PALB2, in complex with BRCA1, BRCA2 and RAD51, is effectively recruited to sites of damaged chromatin; and (4) deacetylated ChAM binding to exposed damaged chromatin allows appropriate engagement of this complex with damaged DNA and hence promotes RAD51 loading and HR repair.</p><p>These findings further our understanding of how the ChAM domain interacts with nucleosomes and how this association is dynamically regulated. It was previously demonstrated that the evolutionarily highly conserved N-terminal part of the ChAM affects its association with nucleosomes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Bleuyard et al., 2017a</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Bleuyard et al., 2017b</xref>), while an interface composed of basic residues across the ChAM binds to an acidic surface on histone H2A in the nucleosome core particle (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Belotserkovskaya et al., 2020</xref>). Our results presented here introduce an additional complexity, showing that the C-terminal 7K basic patch is essential for context-dependent ChAM interaction with nucleosomes. Specifically, ChAM binding to nucleosomes at active genes is promoted by 7K patch acetylation, while its dynamic recruitment to damaged chromatin is stimulated by 7K patch deacetylation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figures 3</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig9">9C and D</xref>). Considering negative charge of nucleosomal DNA, it is not surprising that lysine acetylation, which neutralises its positive charge, might impact ChAM interaction with nucleosomes. However, our results have also revealed that the acetylation of the 7K patch provides a non-electrostatic and as-yet incompletely understood mechanism to enhance its association with nucleosomes. Intriguingly, the flanking regions of the ChAM also appear to influence ChAM binding to nucleosomes (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2A, B and C</xref>): an N-terminal extension enhanced ChAM interaction with nucleosomes, while a C-terminal extension had a negative impact. These regions are rich in serine and threonine residues, including potential targets for cell cycle regulators (CDKs and PLK1) and DNA damage-responsive kinases (ATM and ATR) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig9s1">Figure 9—figure supplement 1</xref>). These observations suggest that additional PTMs other than lysine acetylation might be involved in regulating ChAM association with nucleosomes. These would undoubtedly merit further investigation.</p><p>The increase in PALB2 mobility during the DDR shown in this study (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4D and E</xref>) is reminiscent of previous reports demonstrating increased RAD51 mobility upon replication stress (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">Srivastava et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib48">Yu et al., 2003</xref>). Yu et al. showed that a fraction of RAD51, which is in complex with BRCA2, is immobile in unchallenged cells, but becomes mobile upon hydroxyurea-induced replicative stress (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib48">Yu et al., 2003</xref>). Notably, their data suggested that such increased RAD51 mobility was unlikely to be a consequence of altered interaction with BRCA2 upon replicative stress. Similarly, Jeyasekharan et al. reported increased BRCA2 mobility upon IR-induced DNA damage, which was dependent on the DNA damage signalling kinases ATM and ATR and coincided with active HR events (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Jeyasekharan et al., 2010</xref>). Given that BRCA2 and PALB2 form a stable complex together with a fraction of RAD51 and that their interaction is important for HR repair, we suggest that the BRCA2-PALB2 complex and associated RAD51 are mobilised together upon genotoxic stress.</p><p>The mechanisms finely regulating the mobilisation and localisation of HR factors are not fully elucidated but undoubtedly involve PTMs. We propose that dynamic modes of PTM-mediated chromatin association synergistically govern the recruitment of repair factors to defined regions of chromatin. In undamaged cells, PALB2 is enriched at actively transcribed genes through KAT2A/2B-mediated ChAM acetylation and H3K36me<sup>3</sup>-mediated MRG15 interaction, while maintaining transient chromatin interaction. This transient mode of association may allow a severance mechanism, in which PALB2 continuously monitors the presence of DNA damage across these regions. Indeed, cells expressing PALB2 7R, which is capable of bulk chromatin association (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5</xref>) but fails to bind specific active genes (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig9">Figure 9D</xref>), exhibited an increase in the basal level of γ−H2A.X compared to those expressing PALB2 WT (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8">Figure 8F</xref>) and reduced survival (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig9">Figure 9B</xref>), underlining the importance of PALB2 acetylation in unperturbed cells. Upon DNA damage, however, ChAM is deacetylated (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4B and C</xref>) and, as a consequence, PALB2 affinity for undamaged chromatin is reduced (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig9">Figure 9D</xref>). We suggest that damage-induced ChAM deacetylation allows its recruitment to sites of DNA damage through its interaction with damage-sensing factors, fulfilling its function in promoting HR repair.</p><p>Markedly, PALB2 occupancy at active genes, as detected by ChIP-qPCR (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig9">Figure 9D</xref>), was effectively reduced to null following IR exposure (i.e. comparable to the level in cells complemented with empty vector), although it may represent only the sub-fraction of PALB2 bound to the loci tested. Regardless, these observations raise a fundamental question: why does PALB2 dissociate from active genes with the potential risk of leaving these regions unprotected? Notably, the abundance of endogenous PALB2 protein is estimated to be considerably lower than that of BRCA2 or RAD51, for example ~60 times less than BRCA2 and ~600 times less than RAD51 in HeLa cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Kulak et al., 2014</xref>). The majority of PALB2 is also found to be associated with BRCA2 on nuclear structures (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib44">Xia et al., 2006</xref>) and with MRG15 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Bleuyard et al., 2017b</xref>). Hence, we envision that, in endogenous conditions, PALB2 primarily associates with BRCA2 and RAD51 on actively transcribed loci to protect these regions (though PALB2-free pools of BRCA2 and RAD51 presumably exist), but when DNA damage occurs elsewhere, the same complex needs to be mobilised to promote HR repair. In light of these considerations, our experimental platform assessing cells expressing exogenous PALB2 variants, at higher than endogenous levels, might have somewhat compromised sensitivity to highlight the physiological impact of the PALB2 mobilisation. Either way, we envision that the under-enrichment of PALB2 at active genes is unlikely to confer severe consequences for the transcription-replication conflict, as IR would trigger the global DNA damage checkpoint, slowing replication fork progression (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Lajitha et al., 1958</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Ord and Stocken, 1958</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib41">Watanabe, 1974</xref>) while broken DNA is repaired.</p><p>Intriguingly, while PALB2 7K variants, with either Q or R substitutions, equally interact with BRCA1 in both undamaged and IR-treated conditions (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6s1">Figure 6—figure supplement 1</xref>), their recruitment to sites of DNA damage appeared more affected with the 7R mutant (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6</xref>). We postulate that the random mode of the 7R mutant chromatin association prevents its damage-induced mobilisation, which is normally triggered by ChAM deacetylation specifically occurring at transcriptionally active chromatin upon DNA damage and hence making PALB2 globally available for HR. In the meantime, PALB2 recruitment itself does not appear to guarantee RAD51 assembly. Both the 7R and 7Q substitutions elicited significant impairment of RAD51 foci formation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figures 7</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8">8</xref>), suggesting that the 7K-patch promotes optimal RAD51 engagement with broken DNA, conceivably in part through its direct interaction with the nucleosome acidic patch regions exposed at damaged chromatin (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Belotserkovskaya et al., 2020</xref>). It should be noted, however, that the full impact of the 7R and 7Q mutations on HR repair remains unclear. We endeavoured to assess HR proficiency of these cell lines using our reporter systems, which monitor the HR-mediated integration of a promoterless GFP gene and the resultant expression of fluorescent protein as the readout (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">Rodrigue et al., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib46">Yata et al., 2012</xref>). Through these approaches, significant HR defects were not detected (data not shown). This could potentially be explained by the model that the PALB2 7K-patch is particularly important for HR repair of DSBs arising outside active genes, the detection of which is not straightforward using available techniques. Further investigation using more elaborate strategies, which allow the evaluation of HR repair outside active genes, is warranted to fully appreciate the importance of PALB2 ChAM acetylation in HR repair.</p><p>Overall, the results of this study highlight the importance of the dynamic regulation of PALB2, where both its acetylated and non-acetylated forms play critical roles in genome integrity control. Our work also suggests that caution should be exercised in the use of amino acid substitutions for functional studies of lysine acetylation. K to Q substitutions confer charge loss, as seen in lysine acetylation, but also significantly reduce the size of the side chain (compared to acetylated lysine) and, hence, do not truly mimic acetyl-lysine. Non-acetylatable K to R substitution similarly affects the size of the side chain, albeit less dramatically than K to Q. These limitations are distinctly reflected in our biochemical analyses of ChAM variants with amino acid substitutions, properties of which did not match those of synthetic ChAM peptides with and without acetylated lysine residues (compare <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figures 2G</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">3D</xref><bold>)</bold>. Robust in vivo assessment of acetylation events would ideally involve the development of a chemically modifiable residue that exhibits improved similarity to acetylated lysine in a reversible manner.</p><p>This study highlights a new molecular mechanism by which KAT2A/2B controls genome stability. Our KAT2A/2B-dependent acetylome study identified 398 novel potential protein targets (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Fournier et al., 2016</xref>), indicating that the mechanism of KAT2 action in controlling genome stability is multifaceted and more complex than previously anticipated. It is important to note that, in the cell, KAT2A/2B do not act on their own but within large protein complexes, namely the SAGA (Spt-Ada-Gnc5-Acetyltransferase) and the ATAC (Ada-two-A-containing Acetyltransferase) complexes, at transcriptionally active chromatin (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Nagy and Tora, 2007</xref>). Components of these complexes regulate their enzymatic activity and substrate specificity. Markedly, ENY2 and ATXN7L3, components of the SAGA module that catalyses deubiquitination of histone H2Bub1 have been shown to play a role in preventing unscheduled HR repair in human cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Evangelista et al., 2018</xref>). We postulate that KAT2A/2B-containing complexes concurrently regulate the HR machinery and chromatin in undamaged cells, such that they ensure the activation of HR repair only when needed. KAT2A/2B-containing complexes are key regulators of processes controlling genome stability and will merit further investigation in the future.</p><p>More broadly, lysine acetylation is known to control biological processes, such as transcription, based on the metabolic status of the cell (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Lee et al., 2014</xref>). Therefore, a better appreciation of the role of lysine acetylation in the DDR could expand the scope of studies aiming to understand how reprogrammed metabolism could increase genome instability in cancer cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Nowell, 1976</xref>). Since PTMs are essential for physiological homeostasis and metabolites are necessary cofactors for the deposition of these PTMs, we envision that reprogrammed metabolism in cancer cells could alter the PTM landscape of DDR proteins and hence contribute to genome instability. Future studies assessing aberrant PALB2 lysine acetylation in cancer tissues and whether KDAC or bromodomain inhibitors, currently in clinical trials for cancer therapy, would modulate PALB2 acetylation may offer therapeutic potential. Furthermore, deciphering the metabolic regulation of the DDR and DNA repair could highlight additional cellular pathways that might be targeted for cancer therapy, possibly in combination with existing therapies that otherwise may give rise to resistance.</p></sec></body><back><sec sec-type="additional-information" id="s5"><title>Additional information</title><fn-group content-type="competing-interest"><title>Competing interests</title><fn fn-type="COI-statement" id="conf1"><p>No competing interests declared</p></fn><fn fn-type="COI-statement" id="conf2"><p>No competing interests declared</p></fn></fn-group><fn-group content-type="author-contribution"><title>Author contributions</title><fn fn-type="con" id="con1"><p>Conceptualization, Resources, Data curation, Validation, Investigation, Visualization, Methodology, Writing – original draft, Writing – review and editing</p></fn><fn fn-type="con" id="con2"><p>Formal analysis, Methodology, Validation, Visualization, Writing – review and editing</p></fn><fn fn-type="con" id="con3"><p>Formal analysis, Validation, Visualization, Methodology, Writing – review and editing</p></fn><fn fn-type="con" id="con4"><p>Resources, Data curation, Formal analysis, Validation, Investigation, Visualization, Methodology, Writing – review and editing</p></fn><fn fn-type="con" id="con5"><p>Data curation, Formal analysis, Investigation, Visualization, Writing – review and editing</p></fn><fn fn-type="con" id="con6"><p>Data curation, Formal analysis, Visualization, Writing – review and editing</p></fn><fn fn-type="con" id="con7"><p>Data curation, Formal analysis, Investigation</p></fn><fn fn-type="con" id="con8"><p>Data curation, Investigation, Methodology</p></fn><fn fn-type="con" id="con9"><p>Conceptualization, Resources, Methodology, Writing – original draft, Writing – review and editing</p></fn><fn fn-type="con" id="con10"><p>Resources, Supervision, Methodology, Writing – review and editing</p></fn><fn fn-type="con" id="con11"><p>Conceptualization, Formal analysis, Supervision, Funding acquisition, Validation, Investigation, Writing – review and editing</p></fn><fn fn-type="con" id="con12"><p>Conceptualization, Resources, Data curation, Formal analysis, Supervision, Funding acquisition, Validation, Investigation, Visualization, Methodology, Writing – original draft, Project administration, Writing – review and editing</p></fn></fn-group></sec><sec sec-type="supplementary-material" id="s6"><title>Additional files</title><supplementary-material id="transrepform"><label>Transparent reporting form</label><media xlink:href="elife-57736-transrepform1-v2.docx" mimetype="application" mime-subtype="docx"/></supplementary-material></sec><sec sec-type="data-availability" id="s7"><title>Data availability</title><p>The mass spectrometry proteomics data have been deposited to the ProteomeXchange Consortium via the PRIDE (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Perez-Riverol et al., 2019</xref>) partner repository with the dataset identifier PXD014678 and PXD014681.

homologous recombination though its association with BRCA1 and BRCA2. The evidence that PALB2 acetylation regulates its nuclear mobility is multi-faceted and convincing and the major strength is the definition of the role of de-acetylation of the ChAM domain of PALB2 to mobilize the protein under genotoxic stress. Individuals with an interest in genome stability will be the audience for this important study.</p></body></sub-article><sub-article article-type="decision-letter" id="sa1"><front-stub><article-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.57736.sa1</article-id><title-group><article-title>Decision letter</article-title></title-group><contrib-group content-type="section"><contrib contrib-type="editor"><name><surname>Heyer</surname><given-names>Wolf-Dietrich</given-names></name><role>Reviewing Editor</role><aff><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="ror">https://ror.org/05rrcem69</institution-id><institution>University of California, Davis</institution></institution-wrap><country>United States</country></aff></contrib></contrib-group></front-stub><body><boxed-text id="sa2-box1"><p>In the interests of transparency, eLife publishes the most substantive revision requests and the accompanying author responses.</p></boxed-text><p>[Editors' note: this paper was reviewed by <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://www.reviewcommons.org/">Review Commons</ext-link>.]</p><p>Thank you for submitting your article &quot;KAT2-mediated acetylation switches the mode of PALB2 chromatin association to safeguard genome integrity&quot; for consideration by <italic>eLife</italic>.

We believe the revision and the proposed added experiments will be needed to cement the conclusions.

We do not consider experiment #3 (PALB2 foci) as critical. We encourage the authors to plan and execute this revision as they outlined with the above exception of experiment #3.

(<italic>eLife</italic>-57736R1), the authors have added experiments and analysis to address concerns raised previously. This reviewer appreciates the elegant systems employed in much of this work, as well as the effort that went into this revision. The revised manuscript continues to offer potential insights into the regulation and function of PALB2 in DNA repair, and into the role of acetylation in regulating DNA damage responses. However, there are still major concerns, which in the opinion of this reviewer, should be addressed prior to potential publication. These include issues with certain newly added figures, and apparent inconsistencies or contradictions between different results. As a consequence, the model presented in Figure 7D is not yet fully supported.</p><p>1. The 2nd paragraph on p. 21 of the unmarked revision discusses levels of γ-H2AX shown in Figures 5D-E in the context of DNA replication (this paragraph is part of a subsection of the Results beginning on p. 20). Earlier in this same paragraph the authors hypothesize that &quot;PALB2 association with active genes … prevents the induction of DNA damage during DNA replication&quot;. In this context, Figures 5D-E are misleading and are not necessarily related to DNA replication. Specifically, the cells were not synchronized and DNA damage arises over several days, leading to questions about the relationship to DNA replication. This would be better supported by performing ChIP assays using γ-H2AX antibody to determine whether DNA damage specifically accumulates at transcriptionally active sites, where conflicts with DNA replication may arise, as compared to other sites. Further, no measures of statistical significance are given for Figure 5E.</p><p>2. While HR data was added at the request of a reviewer, the intent is presumably to strengthen the hypothesis that ChAM acetylation regulates PALB2 function in DNA repair. Four points about this:</p><p>A) No measure of significance is given for the HR results shown in Figure 7—figure supplement 1. Further, the error bars are often very large. As such, no convincing conclusions can be made about the effects of the 7Q and 7R mutants on HR.</p><p>B) In any case, if the finding was sufficiently established that both the 7Q and 7R mutants disrupt DSB-HR, as suggested by the authors, how do they rectify this with the observation that only 7Q but not 7R sensitizes U2OS cells to Olaparib in Figure 7C? Does the 7R mutant perturb HR with no consequences for cellular survival in the presence of DNA damage? And, if so, what additional function is perturbed by the 7Q mutant that results in sensitivity to Olaparib?</p><p>C) In the last paragraph on p. 26, the authors write, &quot;We suggest that damage-induced ChAM deacetylation allows its recruitment to sites of DNA damage through its interaction with damage sensing factors, fulfilling its function in promoting HR repair&quot;. If all of this is true, since PALB2-7R was never acetylated and therefore did not need to be deacetylated or released from sites of active transcription, then, according to their model, why is this mutant defective for HR (Figure 7—figure supplement 1)? Is this finding consistent with the model presented in Figure 7D?</p><p>D) On p. 27 (Discussion), the authors state, &quot;Interestingly, the PALB2 7R variant, unlike its 7Q counterpart, had little impact on RAD51 foci formation … This could be explained by our findings that DNA damage triggers ChAM deacetylation and promotes PALB2 mobilisation, which we propose is the critical event in initiating HR repair&quot;. This statement seems to overlook data shown in Figure 7—figure supplement 1 that claims PALB2-7R appears is deficient for HR. Further, proficiency for RAD51 foci in response to IR typically is associated with functional HR, but 7R has nearly normal RAD51 foci while suggested to be deficient for HR. Can the authors' explain this based upon their model?</p><p>3. In the model presented in Figure 7D, the authors suggest (1st paragraph of the Discussion, on p. 24) that DNA damage triggers ChAM deacetylation (presumably on PALB2 localized to transcriptionally active chromatin) which &quot;releases PALB2 from active genes and increases its mobility&quot;. I have the following concerns about the model (in addition to those detailed in point #2):</p><p>A) When discussing their model, it is currently unclear whether the authors are proposing that ChAM deactylation is occurring specifically at &quot;transcriptionally active chromatin&quot; in response to DNA damage and whether this makes PALB2 &quot;globally&quot; available for HR.</p><p>B) The data shown in Figures 4B-C seems to contradict the authors' model (Figure 7D). If the role of ChAM deacetylation is simply to release &quot;PALB2 from active genes and increase(s) its mobility&quot;, then the 7Q mutant (mimic of acetylated lysine), by being more mobile (Figure 7D-E), should be available for &quot;HR repair complexes&quot; that form in chromatin. Because the 7Q mutant shows less association with chromatin than WT PALB2 or the 7R mutant (Figures 7B-C), one wonders if the 7Q mutant impairs some other PALB2 function besides release from transcriptionally active chromatin upon DNA damage. Additionally, the 7R (non-acetylable) mutant appears functional as indicated by normal cellular resistance to Olaparib (Figure 7C). This does not support any claim there is a specific need that PALB2 be recruited to transcriptionally active chromatin and subsequently released.</p><p>C) Unless I overlooked it, it seems that the authors did not specifically test the effect of the 7R mutant on the association of PALB2 (or the ChAM domain) with nucleosomes; this may be helpful in better interpreting various results in the context of their model.</p><p>D) Since the 7R mutant shows even less association with transcriptionally active chromatin (Figure 5F) than PALB2-7Q, and PALB2-7R is resistant to Olaparib (Figure 7C), then it would seem that protection of &quot;transcriptionally active chromatin … during DNA replication (2nd paragraph of p. 24) is not essential for cell survival in response to DNA damage.</p><p>E) The model that acetylation of the 7K patch releases PALB2 from transcriptionally active chromatin would be better supported by testing this in the presence of IR (or Olaparib), since DSB-initiated HR and cellular resistance to Olaparib are among DNA damage response-related assays featured in the manuscript. Does IR or Olaparib indeed release WT PALB2 from transcriptionally-active loci?</p><p>F) According to the model presented, are transcriptionally-active loci left deprotected after acetylation of the ChAM motif that results in increased mobilization of PALB2 for HR?</p><p>G) In the absence of assays of PALB2 with transcriptionally active loci after exposure to IR (or PARP inhibitor), the authors have not convincingly demonstrated that PALB2 is mobilized from these loci after DNA damage. While the authors note that Bleuyard et al. 2017b demonstrate that CPT induces decreased association of PALB2 with transcriptionally active chromatin, CPT could have a different effect than IR by inducing more replication stress.</p><p>4. The authors note that both K to R and K to Q substitutions alter the size of the side chain, albeit to different degrees. How confident are the authors that K to R and K to Q substitutions are accurate non-acetyl and acetyl mimics, respectively? Is it possible that both substitutions are simply disrupting the structure of the ChAM, and perhaps PALB2 more globally, to some degree?</p><p>5. In contrast to association of PALB2 with transcriptionally active chromatin regulating interaction with BRCA1, as proposed, structural changes across the ChAM, or in PALB2 more broadly, could potentially cause the observed decreased interactions of the 7R and 7Q PALB2 mutants with BRCA1.</p><p><italic>Reviewer #2 (Recommendations for the authors):</italic></p><p>Most of the concerns raised previously have been taken into account and the manuscript has now been much improved.

Saying this, there are still some outstanding questions that should be addressed:</p><p>A) It is still not clear as to the (intended) purpose of the GST-ChAM DNA-binding experiments and what these actually contribute to the manuscript as a whole.

This is necessary to support the set of experiments described at a later point in the manuscript. What is the effect of the 7R construct in the GST-pulldown experiments – does this still bind to nucleosomes / histone H3?</p><p>C) Figure 3F, why is there a such a significant increase in PALB2 mobility in the FRAP experiment for the negative control siCntrl?

Your revised article has been evaluated by Jessica Tyler (Senior Editor) and a Reviewing Editor.</p><p>The manuscript has been significantly improved but there are some remaining issues that need to be addressed, as outlined below:</p><p>In the current revision of their manuscript, Fournier et al. have, in general, addressed the concerns that were raised previously. This includes removal of confounding results and addition of new data, such as survival assays, recruitment to sites of DNA damage, and ChIP assays for occupancy at transcriptionally active sites with and without IR, for WT PALB2, and the 7Q and 7R mutants. Overall, the data and presentation are now much more cohesive and are integrated into an interesting model in Figure 9E. As in previous versions, an impressive array of complementary techniques have been employed in this manuscript. This manuscript will make an important contribution to the literature on DNA damage responses.</p><p>Having said all of this, it should be noted that the manuscript still requires certain clarifications in the text and/or figures. This will not require additional experimentation only text changes and clarifications that would strengthen this manuscript further and improve overall clarity.</p><p>1) There needs to more clarity, about roles in DNA repair/cell survival away from transcriptionally active genes, of the full cellular pool of PALB2 vs the sub-fraction that is specifically associated with transcriptionally active sites. a) Do the authors propose that any PALB2 remains at transcriptionally active sites after the induction of DNA damage elsewhere and if so whether this may provide ongoing protection of active genes and b) whether the authors are proposing that a PALB2-BRCA2-RAD51 complex is mobilized from transcriptionally active genes and whether the PALB2-BRCA2-RAD51 complex exists away from transcriptionally active genes at steady state.</p><p>2) The statements about the role of the 7K-patch in HR needs to be softened and clarified how results obtained with the 7R and 7Q variants provide complementary information about PALB2's regulation and function in response to DNA damage. There were reasons for removing data from HR reporter assays, but a reader may consider conclusions about the role of the 7K-patch in HR based only on RAD51 foci to not be fully supported. As such, it is suggested that the authors briefly discuss their HR reporter assay results (in either the Results or Discussion) as data not shown and indicate why these results may not be congruent with those obtained for RAD51 foci. Finally, in the absence of HR reporter assay data, I would suggest toning down the headings in various places to less definitively link the 7K patch to HR repair (line 610; lines 1026-1027; lines 1044-1045. In general, RAD51 focus formation cannot be equalized with HR.</p><p>3) A measure of the statistical significance of differences in Figure 4C is needed.</p><p>4) It looks like there is a non-specific band in the blot for PALB2 in Figure 6A.

Perhaps making this figure part larger relative to the overall figure would help with this. Alternatively, the intensities could be enhanced in the images if the current relative size of the figure part is retained.</p><p>6) There is a single statement that appears to have been carried forward from the previous version which should be removed (page 22, line 524-525) 'while suppressing non-specific DNA binding'.</p></body></sub-article><sub-article article-type="reply" id="sa2"><front-stub><article-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.57736.sa2</article-id><title-group><article-title>Author response</article-title></title-group></front-stub><body><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>The manuscript by Fournier et al. highlights the importance of acetylation in the ChAM domain of PALB2 in regulating nucleosome binding and DNA repair.

They then generate K to R mutations (7R) or K to Q mutations (7Q) at these sites and perform assays of fluorescence recovery after photobleaching (FRAP) to measure mobility as a measure of chromatin association, RAD51 foci, PALB2 recruitment at sites of laser-induced DNA damage, and sensitivity to olaparib. They find increased mobility of the 7Q mutant of PALB2 but not 7R in the absence of exogenous DNA damage, as well as defects in DNA damage-induced RAD51 foci and resistance to olaparib. On this basis, the authors conclude that acetylation is required for the association of PALB2 with undamaged chromatin and that deacetylation permits mobilization and association with BRCA1 to enable proper DNA repair. While the manuscript is generally well-written, many of the systems are rather elegant, and this study may yield novel insights into the regulation and function of PALB2 in DNA repair, there are some missing experiments to be added and important contradictions that should be resolved in order to fully establish the new model the authors propose.</p><p>Major comments:</p><p>1. There are some concerns about the interpretation of experiments with the 7R and 7Q mutants of PALB2. For example, in the description of results in Figure S2C, the authors state &quot;K to R substitutions maintain the charge yet are unable to accept acetylation and hence mimic constitutively non-acetyl lysine&quot;. However, in Figure 4B the association of the 7R mutant with chromatin is similar to WT and in Figure 7D,E the relative immobility of the 7R mutant is very similar to WT PALB2. Thus, the conclusion that acetylation is required for PALB2 association with damaged undamaged chromatin and for release of PALB2 upon DNA damage does not appear justified. Perhaps the authors need to better consider whether the 7R mutant mimics acetylation because of its charge. Even so, the mutant then maintains the charge normally associated with acetylated PALB2, calling into question whether deacetylation indeed &quot;releases PALB2 from undamaged chromatin&quot;.</p></disp-quote><p>We agree with the reviewer’s point that there is no or little difference between WT and the 7R mutant in regard to their enrichment on non-damaged chromatin, as detected by fractionation (Figure 4B and C), or their mobility, as detected by FRAP (Figure 4D and E). To better address the question raised by the reviewer, we have conducted biochemical analyses of the ChAM K to R substitutions, testing their direct interaction with DNA (Experiment 1; Figure 2G and H).</p><p>Our analysis of the ChAM 3R4K variant, substituting three conserved lysine residues K436, K437 and K438 with R, revealed that K to R substitutions decreased its binding to DNA, although to a lesser extent than that of a ChAM Q mutant (3Q4K), compared to WT. This observation indicates that (1) ChAM interaction with DNA is mediated not solely by its electrostatic charge, (2) K to R substitutions alters ChAM biochemical properties, and (3) the 7R mutation likely impairs PALB2 association with chromatin as a result of its reduced affinity for DNA. This is described on page 18, lines 437-446.</p><p>The discrepancy between this new finding and the fractionation/FRAP results can be explained by the fact that, in a cellular context, full-length PALB2 is enriched at a fraction of H3K36me3-marked exons (which comprise only 1-1.5 % of the genome), as shown in our previous genome-wide ChIP-seq analysis (Bleuyard et al., 2017, PNAS). We reasoned that bulk fractionation or FRAP analyses might not be sensitive enough to highlight the impact of the 7R mutation, but the ChIP-qPCR method, detecting PALB2 association at defined genic regions would be more appropriate. Thus, we have expanded our ChIP-qPCR analyses to validate our proposed model (Experiment 2: Figure 5F).</p><p>Indeed, our ChIP-qPCR analysis of PALB2 variants at previously identified PALB2-bound loci (i.e. <italic>ACTB</italic>, <italic>TCOF1</italic> and <italic>WEE1</italic>) revealed a statistically significant decrease of PALB2 7R at these loci compared to WT PALB2 in undamaged conditions. This observation supports that PALB2 7R elicits decreased PALB2 association at these loci and that bulk fractionation or FRAP analyses were unsuited to detect the impact of the 7R mutation. This point is now discussed on page 22-23, lines 541-560.</p><p>Overall, the new results led us to revise our interpretation of the 7R mutant. While K to R substitutions alter the biochemical properties of ChAM, the R-associated electrostatic charge, analogously to non-acetylated K, allows dynamic PALB2 association with chromatin except at those actively transcribed loci which are normally bound by PALB2. We propose that, at KAT2A/B-enriched actively transcribed regions, PALB2 is targeted for acetylation, which in turn promotes PALB2 association with chromatin, likely together with MRG15-mediated tethering. This mechanism might potentially contribute to the suppression of HR repair at actively transcribed regions in undamaged cells. This point is now discussed on pages 29-30, lines 726-740.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>2. Related to questions of interpreting results utilizing the 7R and 7Q mutants of PALB2, in Figure 7B,C the 7R mutant but not 7Q supports RAD51 foci and resistance to olaparib similar to WT PALB2. The authors then state in the Discussion that &quot;our work also suggests that caution should be exercised in the use of K to Q substitutions for functional studies of lysine acetylation&quot;. Thus, which mutant is giving the correct and reliable results?</p></disp-quote><p>We apologise for the miscommunication if this point was unclear. Using biochemical approaches, we established that ChAM acetylation, but not K to Q substitutions, facilitates its association with nucleosomes (please compare Figure 2E and Figure 3B). This observation clearly demonstrates that K to Q substitutions do not mimic acetylation at these residues, but instead render PALB2 ChAM functionally null. The PALB2 7Q phenotypes therefore demonstrate the importance of the 7K-patch for ChAM function in HR repair, rather than its acetylation status. In the revised manuscript, we have emphasised the differences between lysine acetylation and the K to Q substitutions throughout (e.g. page 18-19, lines 446-450; page 19, lines 461-465; page 29, lines 716719).</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Perhaps even more importantly, if results with the 7Q mutant are suspect, the conclusion that deacetylation is required for HR (or DNA repair) is suspect because that is the only case where the authors see a defect in RAD51 foci and resistance to olaparib. Similarly, if the 7R mutant &quot;mimics nonacetyl-lysine&quot; then the fact that it has normal RAD51 foci and resistance to olaparib contradicts the conclusion that deacetylation is required for DNA repair.</p></disp-quote><p>As responded in the previous points, we now articulated our view in the revised manuscript. Briefly, K to Q substitutions confer loss of charge but also significantly reduce the size of the lysine side chain compared to that of an acetylated lysine, as depicted in Figure 2—figure supplement 1B. We thus believe that changes in the side chain size might negatively impact on PALB2/ChAM binding to chromatin. This thus makes it impossible to assess the effect of charge loss in the context of the 7Q mutation. Importantly, however, the 7Q mutant, which behaves like a ChAMnull mutant as defined in page 18-19, lines 446-450, was used to demonstrate the importance of ChAM 7K-patch in normally growing conditions (Figure 5) and HR-mediated DNA repair (Figure. 7A-C and Figure 7—figure supplement 1B).</p><p>K to R substitutions also alter the side chain size, i.e. a modest size increase compared to nonacetylated lysine (Figure 2B). We believe that this affects impaired binding of the ChAM K to R variant to naked DNA in vitro (Figure 2H). Cells expressing the PALB2 7R variant showed delayed S phase progression, DNA damage accumulation in undamaged condition (Figure 5A-E), loss of PALB2 association at defined PALB2 target loci (Figure 5F) and somewhat impaired gene-targeting efficiency upon ZFN-induced DSB induction at the AAVS1 locus (Figure 7—figure supplement 1B). Conversely, we observed little defects of the 7R variant upon exposure to genotoxic treatments in terms of its recruitment to DNA damage sites (Figure 7—figure supplement 1E and F), RAD51 foci formation (Figure 7A and B) and olaparib resistance (Figure 7C). The seemingly normal behaviour of the 7R variant can be explained by our observation that the induction of DNA damage triggers ChAM deacetylation (Figure 6B and C) and an increase of PALB2 mobility (Figure 6D-G). In other words, under conditions where the DNA damage response (DDR) is robustly activated, K to R substitutions might more closely mimic a de-acetylated form of PALB2 and be beneficial for HR.</p><p>In summary, it seems clear that amino acid substitutions, K to either Q or R, are not fully optimal in assessing the real impact of acetylation and deacetylation in cellular contexts. Nonetheless, we believe these mutants are useful tools to understand the importance of target residues and to infer the potential impact of acetylation. This point is discussed extensively on pages 28-29, lines 690-723.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>3. There are multiple concerns about Figures 5 and S5. In Figure 5A-C, difference in cell cycle progression after synchronization are relatively small and no rationale/interpretation is given for how this may be related to PALB2 function is given. In Figure 5D,E differences in the levels of γ-H2AX as a marker of DNA damage between different forms of PALB2 do not become readily apparent until about 6 or more days after addition of doxycycline. As such, it seems that these could be indirect effects and it is unclear how strongly this supports the importance of PALB2 acetylation in the DNA damage response.</p></disp-quote><p>We apologise if these points were unclear. We have previously established that steadystate PALB2 chromatin association, jointly mediated by the ChAM and MRG15 interaction, protects a subset of active genes from DNA damage that may otherwise arise from replication-transcription conflicts (Bleuyard et al., 2017, PNAS). The results presented in Figure 5 led us to propose that PALB2 chromatin association is, at least in part, mediated by the ChAM 7K patch, and its impairment (either by 7Q or 7R substitutions) leaves actively transcribed genes normally bound by PALB2 unprotected and exposed to DNA damage during replication. This model nicely supports our observations that both 7Q/7R mutants exhibit slow S-phase progression and accumulation of γ-H2AX over time. These points are now articulated in the revised manuscript on pages 21-23, lines 523-560:</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>In Figure S5, it is interesting that there are differences in the association of different forms of PALB2 with 3 distinct active loci, but no error bars or measures of statistical significance are given. Further at 2 of the 3 loci, the association of the 7Q mutant is closer to WT than the 7R mutant. Taken together, neither Figure 5 nor Figure S5 strongly support the key conclusion that acetylation regulates the association of PALB2 with actively transcribed genes to protect them.</p></disp-quote><p>We appreciate this criticism. To better evaluate how the ChAM 7K-patch impacts on the association of PALB2 with actively transcribed genes, we have performed biological replicates of the ChIP-qPCR analyses of Flag-PALB2 WT, 7R and 7Q at <italic>ACTB</italic>, <italic>TCOF1</italic> and <italic>WEE1</italic> loci (Experiment 2; Figure 5F). The results showed consistently that the 7K substitutions to either 7R or 7Q confer statistically significant decreases in their binding to these loci compared to PALB2 WT. This observation supports our model that PALB2 7Q/7R variants leave actively transcribed genes unprotected and exposed DNA damage, which can cause cellular defects such as slower cell cycle progression.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>4. Figures 6D-G and S6A-D conclude that &quot;DNA damage triggers ChAM deacetylation and induces PALB2 mobilization&quot; based upon FRAP experiments utilizing WT PALB2. But there is no control to demonstrate that this is a specific effect driven by the state of PALB2 acetylation. For example, DNA damage might cause global acetylation changes resulting in relaxed chromatin in which proteins that are not subject to acetylation-deacetylation also show increased mobility.</p></disp-quote><p>We thank the reviewer for this valuable comment. It is true that we cannot formally exclude the possibility that changes in PALB2 mobility are indirect consequence of damage-induced chromatin reorganisation/increased chromatin mobility. However, our analyses clearly demonstrate that ChAM acetylation increases its association with nucleosomes (Figure 3B), while non-nucleosome binding ChAM-null (7Q or deletion) increases PALB2 mobility (Figure 2E, Figure 4E and Figure 4—figure supplement 1C). Further, WT PALB2 mobility increases after KAT2 depletion (i.e. reduction of chromatin acetylation of KAT2 targets, hence leading to chromatin compaction) (Figure 3F), but reduces upon KDAC inhibition (i.e. global increase in acetylation, hence leading to chromatin relaxation) (Figure 3G). Considering all these observations collectively, the increase in PALB2 mobility detectable upon DNA damage is unlikely to reflect global chromatin relaxation, and that PALB2 acetylation influences its mobility in both challenged and unchallenged cells. We have clarified this point on page 24, lines 583-589.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>5. Figure 7B shows that the 7Q mutant has diminished RAD51 foci while Figure S7C,D suggests based upon a different methodology (laser-induced damage) that the 7Q mutant does not affect PALB2 recruitment. Since the issue of recruitment is key to the mechanism proposed, the authors should examine PALB2 foci instead as this may be a more sensitive assay of PALB2 recruitment.</p></disp-quote><p>We appreciate the reviewer’s point. Nonetheless, we believe that the laser-induced experiments provide high sensitivity and resolution for PALB2 recruitment kinetics, as the data were obtained with real-time live-cell imaging. In line with this observation, our preliminary foci analysis indicated that PALB2 7Q was efficient in forming foci upon DNA damage (data not shown). We therefore did not extend this analysis, in accordance with the <italic>eLife</italic> editor recommendation, where PALB2 foci analyses were considered not essential (Experiment 3).</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>6. The authors state in the last sentence of the Results section that &quot;lysine residues within the ChAM 7K-patch are indispensable for PALB2 function in HR&quot; but never test the mutants for HR using reporter assays. The manuscript would be strengthened by performing such assays.</p></disp-quote><p>We have now conducted homology directed recombination (HDR) reporter assays using cells expressing the PALB2 7K variants (Experiment 4; Figure 7—figure supplement 1B). Here, we assessed the gene-targeting efficiency of a GFP-reporter construct that can be integrated at the AAVS1 locus as a readout for HDR. This approach revealed that, compared to cells expressing WT PALB2, GFP integration at the AAVS1 locus upon ZFN-induced DSB was barely detectable in cells expressing PALB2 7Q or 7R (Figure 7—figure supplement 1B and outlined on pages 24-25, lines 603609). This observation supports the notion that the PALB2 7K-patch is indeed important for HDR at this locus under the conditions employed.</p><p>Of note, unlike this ZFN-induced HDR reporter assay, the PALB2 7R mutant was competent in supporting IR-induced RAD51 foci formation and olaparib resistance. We propose that different levels of DNA damage might underlie the difference between these phenotypes. 4Gy IR and 1-2 µM olaparib are expected to induce far more DNA damage compared to ZFN-induced DSB (three AAVS1 loci in triploid U2OS cells), triggering robust DDR, where the 7K-patch is naturally deacetylated on WT PALB2, hence little difference between WT and the 7R mutant. Under the condition in which a limited number of DSB is induced, i.e. modest DDR induction, 7K-patch-mediated chromatin association might remain important at least at an actively transcribed AAVS1 locus.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>7. The model for the role of ChAM acetylation in regulating PALB2 function presented in Figure 7D is not fully supported by the data presented. Critically, while association with RAD51 and BRCA2 is tested in Figure S7B, the authors hypothesize that deacetylation is required to release PALB2 to enable association with BRCA1 but this is not tested utilizing the mutants.</p></disp-quote><p>As suggested, we have assessed BRCA1 association with PALB2 WT and 7R/7Q mutants by pull-down (Experiment 5; Figure 7—figure supplement 1D). Unexpectedly, this analysis revealed decreased binding of BRCA1 to either 7Q or 7R mutant, indicating that PALB2’s competence in associating with active genes (Figure 5F) affects its binding to BRCA1.</p><p>On the basis of this observation, we have revised our discussion on the mechanism by which PALB2 7Q and 7R variants could be recruited to sites of DNA damage (pages 28; lines 690-698). Briefly, PALB2 recruitment to sites of DNA damage might be enabled even with a reduced interaction with BRCA1, or without direct interaction with BRCA1, for example via a mechanism that is promoted by DNA-damage-associated small RNA (sdRNA) (Hatchi et al., 2021). Understanding the mechanism underlying this observation warrant future investigation and is now an active area of our investigation.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Also, there are some specific points that should be considered in the context of the model. This includes how DNA damage may trigger deacetylation, and whether it is the deacetylated state or the process of deacetylation of ChAM that is critical. Also, if acetylation is important for protecting active genes in the absence of DNA damage, is deacetylation necessary to release PALB2 local or global. This is important, because if it is local there needs to be a specific mechanism for local deacetylation, while if deacetylation is global that could result in transcriptionally active genes becoming unprotected.</p></disp-quote><p>We thank this reviewer for this valuable comment. We agree that, while this study establishes that ChAM is deacetylated upon DNA damage, it remains unclear whether the dynamic ‘de-acetylation’ of PALB2 is important for HR repair, and whether or not this is a local event. Regardless, we would like to highlight that PALB2-bound genes are mostly periodic, e.g. those required for cell cycle progression (Bleuyard et al., 2017, PNAS). It would therefore be reasonable to speculate that DNA damage triggers the suppression of periodic gene expression as a part of DNA damage checkpoint signalling, possibly in a KDAC-dependent manner, which then allows release of PALB2 without risking DNA damage that could otherwise be caused by replication-transcription conflict. Mobilised PALB2 might then be recruited to sites of DNA damage for HR repair. In the revised manuscript, we made our best effort to better describe our model, accompanied by the revised model shown in Figure 7D.</p><p>Further study will be required to fully evaluate this model, for example by identifying the specific KDAC involved in ChAM deacetylation and tracking individual PALB2 molecules, which we consider to be beyond the scope of the present study.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Minor Comments:</p><p>a.

This acetylation is shown to be mediated by the acetyltransferases KAT2A/B. Following these investigations, the authors made an effort to place their findings in the context of DNA replication and DNA repair.</p><p>The proposed model is that the acetylation-dependent interaction of PALB2 with chromatin could ensure the protection of the genome during DNA replication and control DNA repair.</p><p>Specific remarks</p><p>1) Based on different experiments, essentially the one shown in Figure 3B, the authors conclude that the acetylation of the ChAM domain enhances its association with nucleosomes.</p><p>However, taking into account the experimental setting, this conclusion should be largely tuned down. Indeed, this enhanced acetylation-dependent nucleosome binding was observed when the experiment was carried out in the presence of excess of free naked DNA.</p><p>Under these conditions, the non-acetylated ChAM fragments became mostly trapped by DNA (clearly shown in Figure 3C/D), and hence would not be available for nucleosome binding, while the acetylated ChAM fragments would remain available for nucleosome association because of their reduced DNAbinding ability.</p><p>Consequently, the acetylation of the ChAM domain would only play a role on the availability of PALB2 for chromatin/nucleosome binding and not directly stimulate nucleosome binding. Therefore, the nucleosome-binding capacity of ChAM by itself should not be dependent on ChAM domain acetylation.</p><p>If true, this hypothesis could also be relevant in vivo since the poly-K in the ChAM domain could also non-specifically interact with nuclear RNAs and hence its acetylation, by releasing it from nuclear RNAs, would make it available for chromatin-binding.</p><p>The importance of RNAs in the regulation of PALB2 nucleosome-binding could be tested in the experiments shown in Figure 2C and 2E by adding RNase to the pull-down medium (WT +/-RNase or addition of increasing exogenous RNAs).</p></disp-quote><p>We are grateful for the reviewer’s detailed comments and find the potential involvement of RNA very intriguing. Indeed, transcriptionally active loci, which are bound by PALB2, are enriched in nascent RNA, and such local RNA may play an important role in promoting the association of acetylated PALB2 with nucleosomes. However, we believe that investigating the role of RNAs in PALB2 nucleosome binding is beyond the scope of this study. As discussed extensively in response to this Reviewer’s point 2 below, we believe the mode of interaction of ChAM with nucleosomes to be highly complex, being jointly mediated by the N-terminal conserved region and the C-terminal lysine cluster. In the revised manuscript, we have discussed in greater details the model of ChAM interaction with nucleosomes (pages 26-27, lines 638-660), based on published and current results presented in this study.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>2) The real question is as follows. While acetylation makes the protein available for nucleosome binding, which part of the ChAM domain is actually mediating nucleosome binding and whether lysine acetylation could be directly involved in this binding. Another question would be to identify the elements in the nucleosome mediating this interaction, histones (core domain, tails, posttranslational modifications, specific histone types), histone-DNA, etc…</p></disp-quote><p>We entirely agree with the reviewer’s question. Despite the increasing recognition of the physiological importance of the PALB2 ChAM and our efforts in understanding the mode of association of ChAM with nucleosomes (including the potential involvement of histone tail modifications), this specific question remains enigmatic.</p><p>Explicitly, our previous work demonstrated that substitutions of residues within the evolutionarily highly conserved N-terminal part of the ChAM perturb its association with nucleosomes (Bleuyard et al., 2017, PNAS; Bleuyard et al., 2017, Wellcome Open Research). A recent study by the laboratory of Prof Jackson proposed that basic residues across the ChAM are part of a binding interface with an acidic patch of histone H2A in its nucleosomal context (Belotserkovskaya et al., Nat Comm. 2020). Our results presented in this study introduced an additional complexity, showing that the C-terminal 7K basic patch is essential for ChAM-nucleosome interaction. Intriguingly, our study also suggests that the regions flanking ChAM, which are phosphorylated at multiple residues, play roles in regulating ChAM binding to nucleosomes (Figure 2B and C; please refer also to our answer to the reviewer’s minor point 6). The summary of these observations is shown in Figure 9—figure supplement 1.</p><p>We are currently working towards solving the structure of ChAM in complex with a nucleosome, which may help to clarify this very important question. At this point, we think a complete description of all the elements required for ChAM-nucleosome interaction is beyond the scope of this manuscript, and should be addressed in future work. In the revised manuscript, we have provided an updated overview of the ChAM elements affecting nucleosome interaction and post-translational modifications (acetylation, phosphorylation) flanking ChAM regions, as summarised in Figure R1, are now presented in Figure 7—figure supplement 2.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>3) Taking into account the authors conclusions on the role of ChAM domain acetylation and its impact on PALB2 mobility, in Figure 4D/E, one should expect a difference of t<sub>1/2</sub> when wild-type and 7R mutant are assayed by FRAP. At least the measures of t<sub>1/2</sub> in the wild-type should have been more heterogeneous compared to the 7R mutant due to the acetylation of the wild-type PALB2 by the endogenous HATs (the impact of endogenous HATs on the wild-type sequence is shown in Figure 3F). Could the authors comment on this?</p></disp-quote><p>We appreciate this reviewer’s point, which is related to reviewer 1’s points 1 and 3, questioning why no difference between WT and the 7R mutant was detected by FRAP assay and cellular fractionation. To address this issue carefully, we have conducted further characterisation of PALB2 K to R variants using DNA binding assays and ChIP-qPCR (Experiments 1 and 2).</p><p>As outlined in our response to reviewer 1’s points 1 and 3, we found that K to R substitutions reduced ChAM binding to naked DNA in vitro (Experiment 1; Figure 2 H) and PALB2 association with three target genes <italic>ACTB</italic>, <italic>TCOF1</italic> and <italic>WEE1</italic> in vivo (Experiment 2; Figure 5 F). Overall, these analyses revealed that K to R substitutions cause reduced DNA and chromatin association at defined loci in a manner independent of electrostatic charges. The discrepancy between these new results (DNA binding and ChIP-qPCR) and previously presented results (FRAP assay and cellular fractionation analysis) can be explained by the fact that PALB2 associates with only a small subset of genes (Bleuyard et al., 2007, PNAS); FRAP assays and cellular fractionation analyses were most likely not sensitive enough to detect minute but critical differences. This point is now extensively discussed in the revised manuscript p19-20, lines 487-506.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>4) It would be better to remove the data presented in Figure 5 since, as currently presented, these investigations remain shallow and do not bring much information on what is happening.

This observation now nicely explains why both PALB2 7R- and 7Q-expressing cells displayed delays in cell cycle progression and accumulated DNA damage over time, likely due to a lack of protection of PALB2-bound genes during replication in both these cell lines. We therefore feel it is important to keep these results in the manuscript to allow readers to comprehend the role of the 7K-patch in both undamaged and damaged conditions.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Minor points</p><p>5) High background of non-enzymatic acetylation of PALB2 fragments makes the identification of KAT2A/B specific acetylation not very convincing.</p><p>The immunoblot detection of acetylation fragments shown in Figure S1 is much more convincing.

Indeed, we noticed that the inclusion of the ChAM C-terminal flanking region perturbs its chromatin association. This region is highly enriched in serine and threonine residues which could be targeted for phosphorylation by cell cycle regulators (CDKs and PLK1) and DNA damage-responsive kinases (ATM and ATR). It is tempting to speculate that, when phosphorylated, this flanking region could mask the basic patch of the ChAM, hence facilitating the release of PALB2 from undamaged chromatin region and its recruitment to sites of DNA damage.

This is followed by a surge of S phase γ-H2A.X foci (Figure 8F) and impaired cell survival (Figure 9B). These observations suggest that these mutants are defective in RAD51 foci formation at randomly distributed DNA damage, stochastically occurring as part of normal physiology (e.g. metabolically generated ROS), resulting in the accumulation of unrepaired DNA and consequential cell death.</p><p>Interestingly, PALB2-7R, but not PALB2-7Q, was less efficiently recruited to DNA damage induced by micro-irradiation (Figure 6), revealing distinct mechanisms underlying the impaired RAD51 foci formation with these mutants. Specifically, the PALB2-7R mutant fails to be recruited to these sites effectively, but PALB2-7Q, while being successfully recruited, is defective in promoting RAD51 foci formation.</p><p>Biochemically, recombinant ChAM 7R, but not ChAM 7Q, binds purified nucleosomes, albeit to a lesser extent than WT (7K) (Figure 2D and E). This finding corroborates our observations that the PALB2 7R largely remains in the chromatin-enriched fraction (Figure 5). AlphaFold2 modelling further predicts greater structural plasticity of ChAM WT (7K) compared to ChAM 7Q or ChAM 7R (Figure 2—figure supplement 2), indicating that ChAM WT has better capacity to explore various structural configurations for its optimum association with nucleosomes compared to the 7R and 7Q counterparts. Indeed, both 7R and 7Q binding to active genes are severely compromised compared to WT (Figure 9D). IR triggered robust release of WT PALB2 from these loci, concomitantly with the ChAM deacetylation.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>2) The authors should acknowledge inconsistencies and revise their model to be compatible with their data.</p></disp-quote><p>Taking all experimental results together, we propose that the ChAM 7K-patch regulates dual modes of PALB2 chromatin association, namely (1) the steady-state PALB2 association with actively transcribed chromatin through the acetylatable 7K, and (2) the damage-induced PALB2 engagement with damaged chromatin through the non-acetylated 7K. Specifically, in unperturbed conditions, WT PALB2 resides at actively transcribed chromatin through MRG15 (Bleuyard et al., PNAS, 2017) and KAT2A-mediated acetylation of the 7K-patch (this study), which is important for protecting active genes from replicative stress (Bleuyard et al., PNAS, 2017). Spontaneous DNA damage, IR and potentially other genotoxic stresses trigger the deacetylation of the 7K-patch, enabling PALB2 mobilisation and its re-localisation to DNA damage sites, including those distant from PALB2-bound actively transcribed regions. At sites of DNA damage, the non-acetylated 7K-patch further supports efficient RAD51 loading onto ssDNA, likely involving its non-specific electrostatic interaction with exposed nucleosomes (Belotserkovskaya et al., Nat Comms, 2020). In this way, WT PALB2, but not the 7Q or 7R mutant, prevents the accumulation of DNA damage and facilitates survival.</p><p>The absence of phenotypes with the HR reporter system and upon olaparib exposure was unexpected. It is noteworthy, however, that the HR reporter systems monitor DNA damage repair within active genes (i.e., AAVS and LMNA) and that PARP1 non-randomly occupies regulatory regions of active genes (Krishnakumar, R., Science, 2008; Krishnakumar and Kraus, Mol Cell, 2010). Hence, it is likely these systems highlight HR events only at actively transcribed genes and nearby loci. We suggest that the regulation of the 7K-patch has more pronounced impact on DNA damage in regions that are distant from transcriptionally active genes. Regardless, given the uncertainty of these observations, we have removed these results from the revised manuscript.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>The reviews contain specific critiques and concerns that will require significant changes in the text. The authors may want to consider removing the DNA binding assays.</p></disp-quote><p>As suggested, we have removed the DNA binding assays, incorporated a significant amount of new experimental data and also considerably changed the main text according to the results. We thank the reviewers for constructive criticisms, which have improved the study and made it more robust.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Reviewer #1 (Recommendations for the authors):</p><p>In this revised manuscript by Fournier et al. (eLife-57736R1), the authors have added experiments and analysis to address concerns raised previously. This reviewer appreciates the elegant systems employed in much of this work, as well as the effort that went into this revision. The revised manuscript continues to offer potential insights into the regulation and function of PALB2 in DNA repair, and into the role of acetylation in regulating DNA damage responses. However, there are still major concerns, which in the opinion of this reviewer, should be addressed prior to potential publication. These include issues with certain newly added figures, and apparent inconsistencies or contradictions between different results. As a consequence, the model presented in Figure 7D is not yet fully supported.</p><p>1. The 2nd paragraph on p. 21 of the unmarked revision discusses levels of γ-H2AX shown in Figures 5D-E in the context of DNA replication (this paragraph is part of a subsection of the Results beginning on p. 20). Earlier in this same paragraph the authors hypothesize that &quot;PALB2 association with active genes … prevents the induction of DNA damage during DNA replication&quot;. In this context, Figures 5D-E are misleading and are not necessarily related to DNA replication. Specifically, the cells were not synchronized and DNA damage arises over several days, leading to questions about the relationship to DNA replication. This would be better supported by performing ChIP assays using γ-H2AX antibody to determine whether DNA damage specifically accumulates at transcriptionally active sites, where conflicts with DNA replication may arise, as compared to other sites. Further, no measures of statistical significance are given for Figure 5E.</p></disp-quote><p>We appreciate this reviewer’s comment and assessed the level of γ-H2A.X in S-phase cells, marked by EdU incorporation (Figures8 and 9). This approach is widely used to robustly assess replication-associated DNA damage. This assessment confirmed that the 7Q and 7R mutants indeed accumulate more γ-H2A.X in S phase cells upon shRNA-mediated depletion of endogenous PALB2; this difference reached statistical significance at day 5 after the expression of shRNA. This finding is reflected by the reduced survival of cells expressing the 7Q or 7R mutant even in the absence of genotoxic treatments.</p><p>Unfortunately, γ-H2A.X ChIP-qPCR proved challenging with the currently available antibody and we were unable to validate whether these S-phase γ-H2A.X foci indeed arise at transcriptionally active sites in 7R/Q cells. Nonetheless, we consider this very unlikely as, in our previous study, we observed no increase of γ-H2A.X at these loci in cells expressing another PALB2 variant which is similarly unable to bind active genes (via MRG15 interaction), unless challenged by CPT, which induces covalent TOP1-DNA binding (Bleuyard et al., PNAS, 2017).</p><p>Significantly, while characterising the cellular phenotypes, we noticed impaired S-phase RAD51 foci formation even in unperturbed 7R/Q cells on day 4, prior to the rise of γ-H2A.X in these cell lines at day 5 (Figure 8). A similar trend was found in 7R/Q cells exposed to IR on day 4 (Figure 7). Given that IR stochastically induces various types of DNA damage across the genome, which could, in turn, impede DNA replication, these observations suggest that the 7Q/R mutants are both defective in the efficient recruitment of RAD51 to DNA damage at random locations of the genome, conferring the global accumulation of DNA damage.</p><p>We further revealed that the PALB2 7R, but not the 7Q counterpart, is less efficiently recruited to laserinduced DNA damage (Figure 6), suggesting that the mechanism underlying RAD51 recruitment to sites of DNA damage is different between these mutants. We propose that defective engagement of the 7Q mutant with damaged chromatin undermines stable RAD51 foci formation, while the 7R mutant, which is ‘glued’ to chromatin non-specifically through electrostatic interaction, failed to be mobilised upon DNA damage, conferring impaired recruitment of RAD51 to sites of DNA damage.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>2. While HR data was added at the request of a reviewer, the intent is presumably to strengthen the hypothesis that ChAM acetylation regulates PALB2 function in DNA repair. Four points about this:</p><p>A) No measure of significance is given for the HR results shown in Figure 7—figure supplement 1. Further, the error bars are often very large. As such, no convincing conclusions can be made about the effects of the 7Q and 7R mutants on HR.</p></disp-quote><p>Despite our greatest effort, we were unable to detect significant HR defects using our HR reporter systems. Specifically, we exploited two reporter assays to evaluate HR competency, by inducing DSB at <italic>AAVS1</italic> by ZFN or at <italic>LMNA</italic> by Cas9, and providing a matching donor plasmid carrying GFP with homologous arms. Successful integration was monitored through the expression of GFP, quantified by FACS or microscopy, and was used as the readout of HR proficiency. However, neither of these assays has provided consistent results in relation to the function of the 7K-patch in HR repair. We highlight, however, several limitations of these HR reporter assays. Firstly, these assays depend on high transfection efficiency and only detect integration of a reporter plasmid at defined, actively transcribed loci (i.e., <italic>AAVS</italic> and <italic>LMNA</italic>), which might not be representative of all types of HR across the genome. Also, unlike physiological HR repair which uses an unbroken sister chromatid as a repair template, these assays use exogenously introduced plasmid DNA as an HR template. Finally, these assays introduce ‘clean’ two-ended DSB, which is likely processed differently from those naturally occurring ‘dirty’ DNA breaks. Accordingly, we have decided to remove these gene-targeting results.</p><p>In the revised manuscript, we have conducted thorough analyses of RAD51 foci (Figures7 and 8), which usually reflects the HR competency. Indeed, RAD51 foci formation is widely used as a reliable readout of HR proficiency in the field, (as the reviewer also comments in D) in this section below (‘proficiency for RAD51 foci in response to IR typically is associated with functional HR’). Accordingly, we infer HR proficiency on the basis of RAD51 foci formation.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>B) In any case, if the finding was sufficiently established that both the 7Q and 7R mutants disrupt DSB-HR, as suggested by the authors, how do they rectify this with the observation that only 7Q but not 7R sensitizes U2OS cells to Olaparib in Figure 7C? Does the 7R mutant perturb HR with no consequences for cellular survival in the presence of DNA damage? And, if so, what additional function is perturbed by the 7Q mutant that results in sensitivity to Olaparib?</p></disp-quote><p>Through our careful re-evaluation, it has become evident that all our cell lines show comparable resistance to olaparib with similar levels of γ-H2A.X and RAD51 foci. While the source of PARP-trapping lesions remains contentious, PARP1 is shown to be intimately linked with transactivation (Krishnakumar, R. Science, 2008; Krishnakumar and Kraus, Mol Cell, 2010). Hence, it is tempting to speculate that olaparib induces more lesions at transcriptionally active chromatin. The lack of phenotypes in the PALB2 7K patch mutant upon olaparib exposure could be explained by a model in which PARP-trapped lesions at actively transcribed chromatin can be effectively repaired without significant involvement of the PALB2 7K patch or, more broadly, without the steady-state presence of PALB2 at these regions. Indeed, transcription itself has been shown to enhance HR efficiency (Ouyang et al., Nature, 2021).</p><p>Accordingly, in the revised manuscript, we shift our focus to the cellular phenotypes in unperturbed conditions and IR response, where statistically significant impairment of S-phase RAD51 foci was observed in both the 7Q and 7R mutant cells (see our response to point 1 above, also outlining our revised model that explains the molecular mechanism underlying these phenotypes).</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>C) In the last paragraph on p. 26, the authors write, &quot;We suggest that damage-induced ChAM deacetylation allows its recruitment to sites of DNA damage through its interaction with damage sensing factors, fulfilling its function in promoting HR repair&quot;. If all of this is true, since PALB2-7R was never acetylated and therefore did not need to be deacetylated or released from sites of active transcription, then, according to their model, why is this mutant defective for HR (Figure 7—figure supplement 1)? Is this finding consistent with the model presented in Figure 7D?</p></disp-quote><p>We apologise for the confusion. In the revised manuscript, we provide additional results showing that ChAM-7R binds to nucleosomes even without acetylation (Figure 2D and E), although its association with transcriptionally active loci in vivo is drastically compromised (Figure 9D). Further, the recruitment of PALB2-7R to laser-induced DNA damage was significantly compromised (Figure 6). Collectively, we propose that PALB2 7R is randomly ‘glued’ to chromatin via electrostatic interaction, making this variant less efficiently mobilised and hence less efficiently recruited to sites of DNA damage.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>D) On p. 27 (Discussion), the authors state, &quot;Interestingly, the PALB2 7R variant, unlike its 7Q counterpart, had little impact on RAD51 foci formation … This could be explained by our findings that DNA damage triggers ChAM deacetylation and promotes PALB2 mobilisation, which we propose is the critical event in initiating HR repair&quot;. This statement seems to overlook data shown in Figure 7—figure supplement 1 that claims PALB2-7R appears is deficient for HR. Further, proficiency for RAD51 foci in response to IR typically is associated with functional HR, but 7R has nearly normal RAD51 foci while suggested to be deficient for HR. Can the authors' explain this based upon their model?</p></disp-quote><p>As stated above, we reassessed IR-induced RAD51 foci formation in S phase, when HR is considered most active (Figure 7B and E). This assessment revealed that both PALB2-7Q and -7R are defective in efficient RAD51 foci formation, indicating impaired HR proficiency. We revised the manuscript accordingly.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>3. In the model presented in Figure 7D, the authors suggest (1st paragraph of the Discussion, on p. 24) that DNA damage triggers ChAM deacetylation (presumably on PALB2 localized to transcriptionally active chromatin) which &quot;releases PALB2 from active genes and increases its mobility&quot;. I have the following concerns about the model (in addition to those detailed in point #2):</p><p>A) When discussing their model, it is currently unclear whether the authors are proposing that ChAM deactylation is occurring specifically at &quot;transcriptionally active chromatin&quot; in response to DNA damage and whether this makes PALB2 &quot;globally&quot; available for HR.</p></disp-quote><p>These are correct – we thank the reviewer for rewording. In support of this idea, our new ChIP-qPCR assessing PALB2 occupancy at transcriptionally active loci revealed that it is indeed reduced upon IR (Figure 9D). We made this clear in Descussion in the revised manuscript (page 29).</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>B) The data shown in Figures 4B-C seems to contradict the authors' model (Figure 7D). If the role of ChAM deacetylation is simply to release &quot;PALB2 from active genes and increase(s) its mobility&quot;, then the 7Q mutant (mimic of acetylated lysine), by being more mobile (Figure 7D-E), should be available for &quot;HR repair complexes&quot; that form in chromatin. Because the 7Q mutant shows less association with chromatin than WT PALB2 or the 7R mutant (Figures 7B-C), one wonders if the 7Q mutant impairs some other PALB2 function besides release from transcriptionally active chromatin upon DNA damage. Additionally, the 7R (non-acetylable) mutant appears functional as indicated by normal cellular resistance to Olaparib (Figure 7C). This does not support any claim there is a specific need that PALB2 be recruited to transcriptionally active chromatin and subsequently released.</p></disp-quote><p>The reviewer is absolutely correct, except that we consider that the 7Q is functionally null in direct chromatin association rather than mimicking acetylated lysine. Indeed, our new experimental results indicate that, while PALB2-7Q can be recruited to sites of laser-induced DNA damage (Figure 6), it fails to promote RAD51 foci formation (Figure 7B and E). It was recently shown that PALB2, through its basic residues within the ChAM, can bind to the acidic surface of nucleosomes at sites of DNA damage (Belotserkovskaya et al., Nat Comms, 2020). We speculate that this engagement allows optimal loading of RAD51 onto ssDNA for HR repair. Our results also support the notion that PALB2 7R is defective in HR repair, albeit unlikely at actively transcribed genes (see our discussion on the HR reporter and sensitivity to olaparib above).</p><p>The need for steady-state PALB2 association at transcribed genes was fully evaluated in our previous publication (Bleuyard et al., PNAS, 2017). When PALB2 association at active genes is compromised, these regions accumulate DNA damage when exposed to the DNA topoisomerase I poison camptothecin (CPT). It remains unclear why PALB2 needs to be released upon DNA damage, but the copy number of PALB2 is estimated at 10 times lower than that of BRCA2 (Kulak et al., Nat Methods, 2014), and we speculate that random and static PALB2 association with chromatin, as seen with the PALB2 7R mutant, is toxic to the cells.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>C) Unless I overlooked it, it seems that the authors did not specifically test the effect of the 7R mutant on the association of PALB2 (or the ChAM domain) with nucleosomes; this may be helpful in better interpreting various results in the context of their model.</p></disp-quote><p>We included the biochemical assessment of the 7R ChAM binding to nucleosomes in the revised manuscript (Figure 2D and E). The purified recombinant ChAM 7R, along with WT and the 7Q, was assessed for its binding to nucleosomes in vitro. Our results show that ChAM 7R indeed maintains nucleosome binding, albeit at a slightly reduced level compared to the non-acetylated WT. Conversely, the 7Q counterpart largely lost its binding to nucleosomes.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>D) Since the 7R mutant shows even less association with transcriptionally active chromatin (Figure 5F) than PALB2-7Q, and PALB2-7R is resistant to Olaparib (Figure 7C), then it would seem that protection of &quot;transcriptionally active chromatin … during DNA replication (2nd paragraph of p. 24) is not essential for cell survival in response to DNA damage.</p></disp-quote><p>We appreciate this critique. As discussed above, we have previously shown that PALB2 association at active genes is important to protect these regions from transcription-replication conflict, which is enhanced by CPT (Bleuyard et al., PNAS, 2017). CPT covalently links TOPI to DNA, which is significantly different from noncovalent PARP-trapping by olaparib (Murai et al., Cancer Res, 2012; Langelier et al., Science, 2012). Unlike TOPI-trapped lesions, the absence of PALB2 at active genes appears to cope well with PARP-trapped lesions, likely due to its more dynamic nature of trapping. Nonetheless, we removed data associated with olaparib treatment to make this manuscript better focused on thier response to randomly induced DNA damage.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>E) The model that acetylation of the 7K patch releases PALB2 from transcriptionally active chromatin would be better supported by testing this in the presence of IR (or Olaparib), since DSB-initiated HR and cellular resistance to Olaparib are among DNA damage response-related assays featured in the manuscript. Does IR or Olaparib indeed release WT PALB2 from transcriptionally-active loci?</p></disp-quote><p>We have reconducted PALB2 ChIP in unperturbed conditions and also in IR-treated cells (Figure 9D). We observe clear enrichment of WT PALB2 at <italic>ACTB</italic>, <italic>TCOF</italic> and <italic>WEE1</italic> loci in unperturbed cells, but this association is greatly reduced in IR treated cells. This observation is consistent with our FRAP results showing increased PALB2 mobility in IR-treated cells (Figure 4D and E). Both the 7Q and 7Q mutants showed reduced association with these loci in unperturbed conditions, and little change of their association upon IR-treatment.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>F) According to the model presented, are transcriptionally-active loci left deprotected after acetylation of the ChAM motif that results in increased mobilization of PALB2 for HR?</p></disp-quote><p>It is widely known that, upon DNA damage, cells suppress overall progression of DNA replication via activation of checkpoints. Hence, we consider that these regions have a reduced risk of generating DNA damage arising from the transcription-replication conflict (Bleuyard et al., PNAS, 2017) while PALB2 acts at damaged DNA for repair.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>G) In the absence of assays of PALB2 with transcriptionally active loci after exposure to IR (or PARP inhibitor), the authors have not convincingly demonstrated that PALB2 is mobilized from these loci after DNA damage. While the authors note that Bleuyard et al. 2017b demonstrate that CPT induces decreased association of PALB2 with transcriptionally active chromatin, CPT could have a different effect than IR by inducing more replication stress.</p></disp-quote><p>As indicated under (E) above, we now include PALB2 ChIP at transcriptionally active loci in IR-treated cells (Figure 9D). It is indeed efficiently released from these loci upon IR.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>4. The authors note that both K to R and K to Q substitutions alter the size of the side chain, albeit to different degrees. How confident are the authors that K to R and K to Q substitutions are accurate non-acetyl and acetyl mimics, respectively? Is it possible that both substitutions are simply disrupting the structure of the ChAM, and perhaps PALB2 more globally, to some degree?</p></disp-quote><p>This is a matter of our active investigation, characterising experimentally the structure of ChAM in the complex with a nucleosome. Nonetheless, in this manuscript, we included AlphaFold2 modelling of ChAM WT (7K), 7Q and 7R mutants (Figure 2—figure supplement 2). It predicts that WT (7K) forms various structural configurations, while 7Q and 7R mutants form consistent structural variations. From this modelling, we infer that WT ChAM has a great flexibility, but that the 7Q and 7Q mutations confer rigidity. This might potentially restrict the way the 7Q and 7R mutants bind nucleosomes, preventing optimum interaction.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>5. In contrast to association of PALB2 with transcriptionally active chromatin regulating interaction with BRCA1, as proposed, structural changes across the ChAM, or in PALB2 more broadly, could potentially cause the observed decreased interactions of the 7R and 7Q PALB2 mutants with BRCA1.</p></disp-quote><p>As commented above (point 4), we now include AlphaFold2 modelling of ChAM WT (7K), 7Q and 7R mutants (Figure 2—figure supplement 2). The region linking the ChAM and the N-terminal BRCA1 binding domain is largely disordered, and the ChAM mutation is unlikely to affect BRCA1 binding. Indeed, our reassessment of PALB2BRCA1 interaction revealed no impact of the mutations in BRCA1 binding.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Reviewer #3 (Recommendations for the authors):</p><p>Fournier et al. – KAT2-mediated acetylation switches the mode of PALB2 chromatin association to safeguard genome integrityThe authors have responded to the comments made by each reviewer, and have made several amendments to the manuscript itself, generally improving its legibility and providing additional supporting data / experiments.

Firstly, the abundance of endogenous PALB2 protein is estimated to be markedly lower than that of other HR factors. For example, Kulak et al., (PMID: 24487582) estimated that there are ~150 molecules of PALB2 per cell, compared to ~10,000 for BRCA2 and ~100,000 for RAD51, in HeLa. Secondly, Xia et al., (PMID: 16793542) reported, on the basis of BRCA2 or PALB2 immunoprecipitation from fractionated cells, that ‘<italic>the majority of nuclear structure bound BRCA2 is associated with PALB2’</italic> and that <italic>‘much of the PALB2 is associated with BRCA2.</italic>’ Finally, we have found that PALB2 associates with MRG15, a chromodomain protein that recognises an epigenetic marker of active genes (i.e. H3K36me3) with high affinity (Bleuyard et al., PMID: 28673974).</p><p>Considering all these observations together, we envision that the majority of endogenous PALB2 is enriched at actively transcribed chromatin in complex with BRCA2, RAD51 and MRG15, although PALB2-free pools of BRCA2 and RAD51 must exist. Upon the induction of DNA damage at random loci, PALB2 at active chromatin is mobilised, and instead becomes enriched at damaged loci, likely through BRCA1-mediated DNA damage recognition. In this context, our experiment assessing cells expressing exogenous PALB2 variants at elevated levels might have limited sensitivity to highlight the physiological impact of the PALB2 mobility as in endogenous conditions, explaining the somewhat subtle cellular phenotypes in our study.</p><p>To specifically address point (a), our ChIP-qPCR data (Figure 9D) indicate that PALB2 occupancy at active genes is effectively reduced to null (i.e. comparable to the level in cells complemented with empty vector) following IR exposure, although we cannot totally exclude the possibility that PALB2 bound at other (untested) actively transcribed genes responds differently. Regardless, we consider it unlikely that damage-induced under enrichment of PALB2 at active genes severely impacts the transcription-replication conflict, as DNA damage would trigger the canonical DNA damage checkpoint (i.e. supressing cell cycle progression), hence slowing the progression of DNA replication (i.e. no active movement of the replication machinery). Regarding point (b), we indeed consider that the PALB2-BRCA1-RAD51 complex is mobilised from actively transcribed chromatin at which it is enriched at steady-state.</p><p>These points are clarified in the revised manuscript with the following paragraph (page 29):</p><p>“Markedly, PALB2 occupancy at active genes, as detected by ChIP-qPCR (Figure 9D), was effectively reduced to null following IR exposure (i.e. comparable to the level in cells complemented with empty vector), though it may represent only the sub-fraction of PALB2 bound to the loci tested. Regardless, these observations raise a fundamental question: why does PALB2 dissociate from active genes with the potential risk of leaving these regions unprotected? Notably, the abundance of endogenous PALB2 protein is estimated to be considerably lower than that of BRCA2 or RAD51, e.g. ~60 times less than BRCA2 and ~600 times less than RAD51 in HeLa cells (Kulak et al., 2014). The majority of PALB2 is also found to be associated with BRCA2 on nuclear structures (Xia et al., 2006) and with MRG15 (Bleuyard et al., 2017b). Hence, we envision that, in endogenous conditions,</p><p>PALB2 primarily associates with BRCA2 and RAD51 on actively transcribed loci to protect these regions (though PALB2-free pools of BRCA2 and RAD51 presumably exist), but when DNA damage occurs elsewhere, the same complex needs to be mobilised to promote HR repair. In light of these considerations, our experimental platform assessing cells expressing exogenous PALB2 variants, at higher than endogenous levels, might have somewhat compromised sensitivity to highlight the physiological impact of the PALB2 mobilisation. Either way, we envision that the under-enrichment of PALB2 at active genes is unlikely to confer severe consequences for the transcription-replication conflict, as IR would trigger the global DNA damage checkpoint, slowing replication fork progression (Lajtha et al., 1958; Ord and Stocken, 1958; Watanabe, 1974) while broken DNA is repaired.”</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>2) The statements about the role of the 7K-patch in HR needs to be softened and clarified how results obtained with the 7R and 7Q variants provide complementary information about PALB2's regulation and function in response to DNA damage. There were reasons for removing data from HR reporter assays, but a reader may consider conclusions about the role of the 7K-patch in HR based only on RAD51 foci to not be fully supported. As such, it is suggested that the authors briefly discuss their HR reporter assay results (in either the Results or Discussion) as data not shown and indicate why these results may not be congruent with those obtained for RAD51 foci. Finally, in the absence of HR reporter assay data, I would suggest toning down the headings in various places to less definitively link the 7K patch to HR repair (line 610; lines 1026-1027; lines 1044-1045. In general, RAD51 focus formation cannot be equalized with HR.</p></disp-quote><p>We appreciate this comment and accordingly included the following paragraph in the Discussion (page 30):</p><p>“In the meantime, PALB2 recruitment itself does not appear to guarantee RAD51 assembly. Both the 7R and 7Q substitutions elicited significant impairment of RAD51 foci formation (Figures 7 and 8), suggesting that the 7Kpatch promotes optimal RAD51 engagement with broken DNA, conceivably in part through its direct interaction with the nucleosome acidic patch regions exposed at damaged chromatin (Belotserkovskaya et al., 2020). It should be noted, however, that the full impact of the 7R and 7Q mutations on HR repair remains unclear. We endeavoured to assess HR proficiency of these cell lines using our reporter systems, which monitor the HR-mediated integration of a promoterless GFP gene and the resultant expression of fluorescent protein as the readout (Rodrigue et al., 2019; Yata et al., 2012). Through these approaches, significant HR defects were not detected (data not shown). This could potentially be explained by the model that the PALB2 7K-patch is particularly important for HR repair of DSBs arising outside active genes, the detection of which is not straightforward using available techniques. Further investigation using more elaborate strategies, which allow the evaluation of HR repair outside active genes, is warranted to fully appreciate the importance of PALB2 ChAM acetylation in HR repair.”</p><p>We have also toned down the headings, which had referred to ‘HR repair’, to a more accurate description (e.g. RAD51 foci formation)</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>3) A measure of the statistical significance of differences in Figure 4C is needed.</p></disp-quote><p>The statistical significance of changes between time 0 and all combined time points (15, 30, 60 and 120 mins), as assessed by the one-way ANOVA, is now reported in Figure 4C.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>4) It looks like there is a non-specific band in the blot for PALB2 in Figure 6A.
