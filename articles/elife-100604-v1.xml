suggesting a role in guiding cellular differentiation. Here, we show that glycolytic flux is required and sufficient to bias multipotent retinal progenitor cells (RPCs) to acquire a rod photoreceptor fate in the murine retina. In RPC-specific <italic>Phosphatase and tensin homolog</italic> conditional knockout (<italic>Pten-</italic>cKO) and RPC-specific conditional gain-of-function of dominant active PFKFB3 (cytoPFKFB3) mice, glycolytic gene expression and activity are elevated, correlating with precocious rod photoreceptor differentiation and outer segment (OS) maturation. Conversely, glycolytic inhibition in retinal explants suppresses RPC proliferation and photoreceptor differentiation, achieved either with 2-deoxy-<sc>D</sc>-glucose, a competitive inhibitor of glucose metabolism, by lowering media pH, which disables PKM2, a rate-limiting enzyme, or by inhibiting lactate/H<sup>+</sup> symporters, which lowers intracellular pH. Mechanistically, we show that Wnt signaling, the top-upregulated pathway in <italic>Pten-</italic>cKO retinas, is a glycolysis-dependent pathway. Pharmacological and genetic perturbation of Wnt signaling by knocking-out <italic>Ctnnb1</italic>, encoding β-catenin, phenocopies glycolytic inhibition, suppressing RPC proliferation, photoreceptor differentiation, and OS maturation. Thus, developmental rewiring of glycolytic flux modulates Wnt signaling to drive rod photoreceptor differentiation and maturation, an instructive role that may be exploited therapeutically for cell replacement strategies.</p></abstract><kwd-group kwd-group-type="author-keywords"><kwd>Pten</kwd><kwd>retinal progenitor cells</kwd><kwd>glycolysis</kwd><kwd>intracellular pH</kwd><kwd>photoreceptor differentiation</kwd><kwd>Wnt signaling</kwd></kwd-group><kwd-group kwd-group-type="research-organism"><title>Research organism</title><kwd>Mouse</kwd></kwd-group><funding-group><award-group id="fund1"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100000024</institution-id><institution>Canadian Institutes of Health Research</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>PJT 180243</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Schuurmans</surname><given-names>Carol</given-names></name><name><surname>Screaton</surname><given-names>Robert A</given-names></name><name><surname>Touahri</surname><given-names>Yacine</given-names></name><name><surname>Kovalchuk</surname><given-names>Igor</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund2"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100000024</institution-id><institution>Canadian Institutes of Health Research</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>PJT – 400973</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Aubert</surname><given-names>Isabelle</given-names></name><name><surname>Schuurmans</surname><given-names>Carol</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund3"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100000023</institution-id><institution>Government of Canada</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>Canada Graduate Scholarship – Doctoral</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Hanna</surname><given-names>Joseph</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund4"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100003579</institution-id><institution>University of Toronto</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>Vision Science Research Program Scholarship</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Hanna</surname><given-names>Joseph</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund5"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100013873</institution-id><institution>Government of Ontario</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>Ontario Graduate Scholarship</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Hanna</surname><given-names>Joseph</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund6"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100003579</institution-id><institution>University of Toronto</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>R.O.

Included are rod and cone photoreceptors, the light-sensing neurons; amacrine, bipolar, and horizontal cells, retinal interneurons; ganglion cells, the output neurons of the retina; and supportive glial cells known as Müller glia. Clonal analyses across vertebrate species have revealed that all seven retinal cell types are derived from multipotent retinal progenitor cells (RPCs) that give rise to clones of varying sizes and compositions (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Alexiades and Cepko, 1997</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Fekete et al., 1994</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Gomes et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Holt et al., 1988</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Jensen and Raff, 1997</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib62">Turner and Cepko, 1987</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib63">Turner et al., 1990</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib67">Wetts and Fraser, 1988</xref>). In mice, RPCs begin to differentiate at embryonic day (E) 12, completing their proliferation and differentiation by postnatal day (P) 10–12 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Cepko, 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib69">Young, 1985</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib72">Zhang et al., 2023a</xref>). Symmetric proliferative (P/P) divisions predominate early in development, followed by a shift to asymmetric (P/D) divisions that renew the RPC pool and generate differentiated cells, and finally, by symmetric differentiative (D/D) divisions that generate two postmitotic cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Baye and Link, 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib43">Nerli et al., 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib46">Paolini et al., 2015</xref>). At each stage, individual RPC fate decisions are largely stochastic, albeit with temporal biases, such that the seven retinal cell types are born in overlapping windows (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Gomes et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">He et al., 2012</xref>). Ganglion, horizontal, and cone cells are born in the earliest embryonic stages, followed closely by amacrine cells, and finally by bipolar cells, rods, and Müller glia, which mainly differentiate in the first two postnatal weeks (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib51">Rapaport et al., 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib69">Young, 1985</xref>). How RPCs interpret extrinsic signals and intrinsic contextual cues to ultimately produce the correct numbers of each retinal cell type remains incompletely understood.</p><p>Cellular energy and precursor metabolites are produced by the metabolism of glucose, which is converted into pyruvate via glycolysis. Glycolysis is a multi-step enzymatic process that occurs in the cytosol, does not require O<sub>2</sub>, and produces 2 molecules of adenosine triphosphate (ATP) per glucose molecule (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Hanna et al., 2022</xref>). Pyruvate is either transported to mitochondria for further oxidation to drive oxidative phosphorylation (OXPHOS) by the electron transport chain, or converted to lactate and secreted out of the cell. OXPHOS is an O<sub>2</sub>-dependent metabolic pathway that produces 30–38 ATP molecules for each glucose molecule, and hence, produces more cellular energy than glycolysis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Hanna et al., 2022</xref>). Yet, the majority of vertebrate retinal cells rely on glycolysis as the main metabolic pathway, even in the presence of O<sub>2</sub> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Hurley et al., 2015</xref>). The preference for aerobic glycolysis has been termed the Warburg effect, an adaptation commonly observed in cancer cells that is also used by some ‘normal’ cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib64">Vander Heiden et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib65">Warburg, 1956a</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib66">Warburg, 1956b</xref>). Included are dividing neural progenitor cells, which use aerobic glycolysis for energy production across tissue types, including in the retina (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Hanna et al., 2022</xref>). In <italic>Xenopus</italic>, RPCs rely on glycogen stores as a fuel source for glycolysis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Agathocleous et al., 2012</xref>), whereas in human retinal organoids, glucose is the essential fuel and is required for RPC expansion at the earliest stages of optic vesicle formation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib59">Takata et al., 2023</xref>). Finally, during murine retinal development, mitophagy clears mitochondria to drive a metabolic shift toward glycolysis, which supports early-RPC differentiation into ganglion cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Esteban-Martínez et al., 2017</xref>). However, whether metabolic reprogramming and levels of glycolytic activity influence RPC differentiation decisions during later developmental stages is not known.</p><p>Metabolic reprogramming, or alterations in metabolic rates and/or pathways, occurs in stem and progenitor cells during tissue development (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib60">Tatapudy et al., 2017</xref>), including in the retina (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Esteban-Martínez et al., 2017</xref>). In a few lineages, metabolism has been ascribed instructive roles in driving cellular differentiation, including in skeletal muscle and helper T cell lineages (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib49">Peng et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib52">Ryall et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib60">Tatapudy et al., 2017</xref>). In these lineages, glycolysis is important for more than energy production, for instance, modifying histone acetylation in murine skeletal muscle (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib52">Ryall et al., 2015</xref>), activating Wnt signaling to control chick neuromesodermal progenitor cell fate choice (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib44">Oginuma et al., 2020</xref>), and altering protein subcellular localization in the murine presomitic mesoderm (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib42">Miyazawa et al., 2022</xref>). To further investigate how developmental signaling pathways intersect with metabolism to control RPC fate choice in the retina, we focused on PTEN, an intracellular protein and lipid phosphatase with pleiotropic actions, including the direct inhibition of glycolysis through dephosphorylation and consequent inactivation of phosphoglycerate kinase 1 (PGK1), a rate-limiting glycolytic enzyme (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib50">Qian et al., 2019</xref>). In <italic>Pten</italic> conditional knockout (KO) retinas, RPCs proliferate excessively early in embryonic development, accompanied by the accelerated differentiation of photoreceptors in the outer nuclear layer (ONL) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Cantrup et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Jo et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib57">Tachibana et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib58">Tachibana et al., 2018</xref>). Here, we show that elevated glycolysis accompanies the accelerated RPC differentiation kinetics in <italic>Pten-</italic>cKO retinas, which ultimately results in the precocious depletion of the RPC pool. Similarly, in an RPC-specific, conditional gain-of-function (GOF) model of dominant active PFKFB3 (cytoPFKFB3), glycolytic gene expression and activity are elevated, correlating with precocious rod photoreceptor differentiation and outer segment (OS) maturation. Conversely, multiple inhibitors of glycolysis reduce RPC proliferation and photoreceptor differentiation. Finally, we found that glycolysis is required and sufficient to control Wnt signaling, and show that Wnt activity is required for rod photoreceptor differentiation and OS maturation. We have thus uncovered a novel glycolytic flux–Wnt signaling axis as an important regulator of RPC fate choice.</p></sec><sec id="s2" sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><sec id="s2-1"><title>Elevated glycolysis and accelerated rod photoreceptor differentiation correlate in <italic>Pten</italic>-cKO retinas</title><p>Neural progenitor cells in the embryonic brain (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Khacho and Slack, 2018</xref>) and retina (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Agathocleous et al., 2012</xref>) preferentially use glycolysis for energy production.

Since these measurements were performed in bulk, and the ratio of RPCs to differentiated cells declines as development proceeds, it is not clear whether glycolytic activity is temporally regulated within RPCs and/or in other retinal cell types. To assess glycolytic gene expression within specific cell populations (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1A</xref>), we mined scRNA-seq data collected from developing retinas between E11 and P14 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Clark et al., 2019</xref>).

We thus asked whether levels of glycolytic activity have an instructive role in rod photoreceptor fate selection. To test this hypothesis, we used two genetic models to elevate glycolytic activity in RPCs.

Thus, for the remainder of this study, we focused on the peripheral retina where the <italic>Pax6-Cre</italic> allele was most active, avoiding the central retina, which was readily distinguishable as it forms a visible hamartoma comprised of remaining wild-type cells in <italic>Pten</italic>-cKO retinas (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib58">Tachibana et al., 2018</xref>).</p><p>Using cellular birthdating, we previously showed that <italic>Pten</italic>-cKO RPCs are hyperproliferative and differentiate on an accelerated schedule between E12.5 and E18.5, yet fewer rod photoreceptors are ultimately present in P7 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib57">Tachibana et al., 2016</xref>) and P21 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Hanna et al., 2025</xref>) retinas, suggestive of a developmental defect. Since retinal cell differentiation persists until ~P12, we conducted similar birthdating experiments, but instead administered BrdU to P4 pups. In wild-type retinas harvested at P14, BrdU cells were mainly distributed between the INL, where late-born bipolar cells and Müller glia localize, and the ONL, where rod photoreceptors migrate (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1G, H</xref>).

P0 explants were mounted on Nucleopore membranes and cultured on top of retinal explant media, providing a source of nutrients, growth factors, and glucose. To block glycolysis, retinal explants were cultured with 2-deoxy-<sc>D</sc>-glucose (2DG), a competitive inhibitor that is transported by GLUT1 and converted by HK1/2 to 2-deoxy-<sc>D</sc>-glucose-6-phosphate, an inhibitor of the glycolytic pathway (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3C</xref>). 2DG is typically used in the range of 5–10 mM in cell culture studies and in general, has anti-proliferative effects (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib70">Zhang et al., 2014</xref>). To test whether 5 mM- and 10 mM-2DG impacted RPC proliferation, explants were exposed to BrdU, which is incorporated into S-phase cells, for 30 min prior to harvesting. 2DG treatment resulted in a dose-dependent inhibition of RPC proliferation as evidenced by a reduction in BrdU<sup>+</sup> cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3D</xref>). To determine whether glycolytic inhibition reduced the overall percentage of RPCs that continued to proliferate, we measured the proliferative fraction (p-fraction) by exposing retinal explants to BrdU at the onset of 2DG treatment, and then immunostaining for BrdU and Ki67, which labels all cycling cells.

While most differentiated cells use OXPHOS for energy production, photoreceptors are an important exception, as these metabolically demanding cells require glycolysis to maintain OSs, which undergo diurnal turnover (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Chinchore et al., 2017</xref>). To examine OS formation, we immunostained P7 wild-type and cytoPFKFB3<italic>-</italic>GOF retinas with rhodopsin (Rho) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4F</xref>). Visually, photoreceptor OS above the ONL, which are labeled with Rho, were larger in P7 cytoPFKFB3<italic>-</italic>GOF retinas, as confirmed by a measurement of the OS area (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4F</xref>).</p><p>To determine whether rod photoreceptor OSs similarly mature precociously in <italic>Pten</italic>-cKO retinas, we first examined the P0 transcriptomic data for OS-enriched genes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Datta et al., 2015</xref>).

However, cells rely on glycolysis for reasons other than energy expenditure. For instance, lactate is a metabolic byproduct that is shuttled out of the cell along with one H<sup>+</sup> ion by lactate/H<sup>+</sup> symporters (Slc16a group proteins) when glycolytic activity is high, effectively increasing intracellular pH (pHi) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5A</xref>). Notably, glycolysis-driven increases in pHi are the central driver of cell fate choice selection in the chick neuromesodermal lineage (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib44">Oginuma et al., 2020</xref>). We found <italic>Slc16a</italic> family lactate/H<sup>+</sup> symporters are elevated in <italic>Pten</italic><sup>cKO</sup> retinas (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2E</xref>), suggesting that more protons may be extruded to increase pHi.

Inhibition of proton-linked lactate transport can lead to intracellular acidification. Thus, the impact of CNCn should block the export of lactate into the extracellular space, effectively lowering pHi and further decreasing glycolysis. To determine whether RPC proliferation was impacted by CNCn treatment, explants were incubated with BrdU 30 min before harvesting. We observed a decrease in the number of BrdU<sup>+</sup> proliferating RPCs in CNCn-treated retinal explants compared to controls (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5C</xref>). This decline in RPC proliferation mirrored the effect of inhibiting glycolysis (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3C</xref>).

Given that altered glycolysis influences intracellular pH, which in turn controls cell fate decisions, we set out to assess the impact of manipulating pH on cell fate selection in the retina. One of the expected impacts of lowering pH was the aggregation of PKM2, a rate-limiting enzyme for glycolysis, which aggregates in reversible, inactive amyloids (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Cereghetti et al., 2024</xref>). We grew retinal explants in media buffered at pH 6.5 (acidic), pH 7.4 (neutral), or pH 8.0 (basic). Increased glycolysis, leading to more H<sup>+</sup> extrusion from the cell and an increase in pHi was modeled by pH 8.0, while decreased glycolysis, leading to less H<sup>+</sup> extrusion and a lower pHi, was modeled by pH 6.5. To assess the impact of pHi changes on RPC proliferation, P0 retinal explants were cultured in media buffered to different pH levels, with BrdU added for 30 min and at the end of the 24-hr culture period. More RPCs were BrdU<sup>+</sup> in pH 8.0 media compared to neutral pH 7.4 media, consistent with the pro-proliferative effect of increased glycolysis (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5D</xref>). Conversely, in media buffered to pH 6.5, the number of BrdU<sup>+</sup> proliferating RPCs declined (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5D</xref>).</p><p>To determine whether pH changes alter the overall percentage of RPCs that continue to proliferate, we measured the p-fraction by exposing retinal explants to BrdU at the onset of pH adjustments and then calculating the p-fraction as the ratio of Ki67<sup>+</sup> cells that were BrdU<sup>+</sup>. We found a pH-dependent increase in the number of BrdU<sup>+</sup> RPCs and in the p-fraction in retinal explants cultured in pH 8.0 compared to pH 7.4 (neutral pH control) media (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5E</xref>). We also observed a corresponding increase in VSX2<sup>+</sup> RPCs in pH 8.0 media (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5F</xref>), and more RPCs differentiated into CRX<sup>+</sup> photoreceptor precursors (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5H</xref>). In contrast, in retinal explants cultured in pH 6.5 media, fewer RPCs entered S-phase as evidenced by the decline in BrdU<sup>+</sup> RPCs and lower p-fraction (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5E</xref>). However, there were more VSX2<sup>+</sup> RPCs in retinal explants grown in pH 6.5 versus pH 7.4 media (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5F</xref>), with no effect on cell death evident as assessed by cleaved-caspase 3<sup>+</sup> cell counts (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5G</xref>), likely because fewer of these RPCs differentiated into CRX<sup>+</sup> photoreceptor precursors (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5H</xref>).

Given the importance of pH to control RPC proliferation and differentiation dynamics, and since not all RPCs differentiate at any given time, we asked whether there was a dynamic representation of pH within RPCs within the developing retina. To test this assumption, we electroporated P3 retinal explants with pCAGG-pHluorin-IRES2-tdTomato, using tdTomato to label transfected cells and pHluorin, a ratiometric pH sensor with a 488 nm activation spectrum in neutral pH. As expected, the 488 nm signal was variable across RPCs that had similar tdTomato levels (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5I</xref>). Taken together, this data is consistent with the idea that pH varies within RPCs, correlating with the propensity of some RPCs to continue to proliferate while others differentiate.</p></sec><sec id="s2-6"><title>Canonical Wnt signaling is active in neurogenic RPCs and controlled by glycolysis</title><p>Our finding that glycolysis might be a central driver of RPC fate selection, in part through the control of pHi, prompted the question of how these biochemical processes might impact cell fate selection.

Ultimately, the changes in RPC proliferation dynamics culminate in the production of fewer amacrine cells and rod photoreceptors populating <italic>Pten</italic>-cKO retinas at P7 and P21 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Hanna et al., 2025</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib57">Tachibana et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib61">Touahri et al., 2024</xref>). To understand how <italic>Pten</italic> controls RPC fate decisions, we first used a transcriptomic approach, revealing an increase in glycolytic gene expression and activity in <italic>Pten</italic>-cKO retinas. Consistent with a role for glycolysis in controlling RPC proliferation and photoreceptor cell differentiation, both were inhibited by 2DG, a pharmacological inhibitor of glycolysis. Conversely, the promotion of glycolytic flux in RPCs using cytoPFKFB3 GOF transgenic mice accelerated photoreceptor differentiation, including the enhanced maturation of rod OSs, an effect phenocopied in <italic>Pten</italic>-cKO retinas. Since elevated glycolytic activity shuttles more lactate/H<sup>+</sup> out of the cell to increase pHi, we cultured retinal explants in media buffered to higher pH levels, which promoted RPC proliferation and accelerated photoreceptor differentiation. Finally, we linked glycolysis and pHi changes to the activation of Wnt signaling, which we found is required to promote RPC proliferation, photoreceptor differentiation, and OS maturation. Taken together, we have uncovered a novel molecular axis controlling RPC fate decisions in the retina that begins with <italic>Pten</italic>, a signal transduction molecule, the loss of which elevates glycolytic activity, pHi, and Wnt signaling (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7F</xref>).</p><sec id="s3-1"><title>The role of glycolysis in retinal development across different species</title><p>The increased glycolytic gene expression in <italic>Pten</italic>-cKO retinas is likely tied to the increased expression of hypoxia-induced-factor-1-alpha (<italic>Hif1a</italic>), a known target of mTOR signaling and a TF that induces <italic>Slc1a3</italic> (GLUT1) and glycolytic gene expression (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Hanna et al., 2022</xref>). Indeed, mTOR signaling is hyperactive in <italic>Pten</italic>-cKO retinas (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Cantrup et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib57">Tachibana et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib58">Tachibana et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib61">Touahri et al., 2024</xref>), and likewise, in <italic>Tsc1-</italic>cKO retinas, which also increase glycolysis via HIF-1A (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">Lim et al., 2021</xref>). Similar to our findings in mice, glycolysis is the predominant mode of ATP production in proliferating <italic>Xenopus</italic> and zebrafish RPCs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Agathocleous et al., 2012</xref>). However, in contrast to the results of our study, treatment of <italic>Xenopus</italic> retinas with 2DG, a glucose inhibitor, does not impact ATP or lactate production, whereas GPI-mediated inhibition of access to glycogen stores reduces energy production (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Agathocleous et al., 2012</xref>). Thus, <italic>Xenopus</italic> RPCs rely on glycogen storage to fuel glycolysis, whereas we found that in mouse retina, a constant glucose supply is required to fuel glycolysis and support RPC proliferation. Consistent with our data, in mice carrying mutations in <italic>Glut1</italic>, a glucose transporter, or <italic>Ldha</italic>, a glycolytic enzyme that converts pyruvate to lactate, RPC proliferation and expansion of the optic vesicle are inhibited (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib59">Takata et al., 2023</xref>). Human RPCs also use glycolysis as revealed by the conversion of <sup>13</sup>C-glucose to lactate, a glycolytic intermediate (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib59">Takata et al., 2023</xref>). Moreover, the inhibition of glucose catabolism by 2DG blocked RPC proliferation and eye morphogenesis in human retinal organoids (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib59">Takata et al., 2023</xref>). Intriguingly, in this organoid study, RPC identity markers, including RAX and SIX3, were also suppressed by 2DG, a phenotype attributed to lactate depletion, which indicates that glycolysis is also critical for progenitor cell identity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib59">Takata et al., 2023</xref>). One possibility is that the ‘energy budget’ of a cell, dictated by ATP and precursor metabolite levels, controls levels of transcription of retinal cell identity genes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Carthew, 2021</xref>). Glycolytic metabolites can also impact gene transcription in other ways. For example, lactate, a metabolic byproduct of glycolysis, inhibits histone deacetylase (HDAC) activity to acetylate H3K27ac and activate eye development genes in retinal organoids (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib59">Takata et al., 2023</xref>). Indeed, the addition of lactate to retinal organoids induces broad transcriptional changes, including an upregulation of genes involved in eye morphogenesis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib59">Takata et al., 2023</xref>). Mechanistically, lactate effects on the transcription of eye field markers are attributed to the inhibition of HDACs, which normally inhibit gene expression via histone deacetylation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib59">Takata et al., 2023</xref>). In the future, we can further assess the impact of 2DG and other metabolic inhibitors on RPC differentiation, focusing on additional retinal cell types, such as bipolar, horizontal, and amacrine cell interneurons, and Müller glia.</p></sec><sec id="s3-2"><title>The regulation and role of pHi and Wnt signaling in cell fate decisions</title><p>A proxy measure for glycolytic activity are the levels of sentinel metabolites that serve as key indicators of metabolic state (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">Kochanowski et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib42">Miyazawa et al., 2022</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib44">Oginuma et al., 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib48">Peeters et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib71">Zhang et al., 2017</xref>). In chick embryonic tailbuds (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib44">Oginuma et al., 2020</xref>) and the murine presomitic mesoderm (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib42">Miyazawa et al., 2022</xref>), FBP was identified as a sentinel metabolite since its levels positively correlate with glycolytic activity. However, while FBP has been ascribed a major role in controlling mouse embryonic mesoderm development (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib42">Miyazawa et al., 2022</xref>), neuromesodermal fate selection in the chick embryonic tailbud is controlled by elevated pHi induced by high glycolytic activity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib44">Oginuma et al., 2020</xref>). In the chick tailbud, high pHi creates an environment that activates Wnt signaling through non-enzymatic acetylation of β-catenin (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib44">Oginuma et al., 2020</xref>). Thus, while phosphorylated and non-phosphorylated β-catenin levels do not vary, K49 β-catenin acetylation is reduced at low pHi (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib44">Oginuma et al., 2020</xref>). The onset of K49 β-catenin acetylation is associated with a switch in cell fate choice from neural to mesodermal in the chick tailbud (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib44">Oginuma et al., 2020</xref>). In contrast, in adult cardiomyocytes, when <italic>Pkm</italic>, a rate-limiting glycolytic enzyme, is mutated, β-catenin can more efficiently shuttle to the nucleus to activate Wnt-signaling and promote cardiomyocyte proliferation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Hauck et al., 2021</xref>). In cardiomyocytes lacking <italic>Pkm</italic>, transcriptional targets of Wnt signaling, including <italic>Axin2</italic>, <italic>Ccnd1</italic>, <italic>Myc</italic>, <italic>Sox2</italic>, and <italic>Tnnt3</italic>, are elevated, and β-catenin protein remains in the cytoplasm, rather than undergoing nuclear translocation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Hauck et al., 2021</xref>). Similarly, in a study performed in cancer cells, high pH leads to increased expression of <italic>Ccnd1</italic>, a β-catenin target gene, and increases proliferation rates (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Koch et al., 2020</xref>). These findings are consistent with our demonstration that β-catenin levels are stabilized at pH 8, and RPC proliferation is enhanced. Whether pH manipulations also influence cell fate decisions by influencing the stability of other retinal proteins, such as PKM2, can be further investigated in the future using specific PKM2 inhibitors, such as Shikonin (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Chen et al., 2011</xref>). Finally, in a separate study performed in cancer cells, acidification induced by metformin indirectly suppresses Wnt signaling by activating the DDIT3 transcriptional repressor (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib41">Melnik et al., 2018</xref>), consistent with our data showing low pH suppresses β-catenin stability. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib41">Melnik et al., 2018</xref> also used Mcl inhibitors, as we did in our study, and showed that this treatment blocks Wnt signaling. While we did not examine the impact of CNCn on Wnt signaling, we did observe a decline in proliferation, as expected if Wnt levels are low.</p><p>Our finding that Wnt signaling is required to maintain RPC proliferation and drive photoreceptor differentiation is contrary to prior studies that ascribed a role to <italic>Ctnnb1</italic> in maintaining RPCs in an immature, uncommitted state without affecting proliferation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib45">Ouchi et al., 2011</xref>). A major difference is that <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib45">Ouchi et al., 2011</xref> found that <italic>Id3</italic>, a neurogenic inhibitor, is upregulated in <italic>Ctnnb1</italic> cKO retinas, whereas we found that <italic>Id3</italic> expression levels decline in <italic>Pten-</italic>cKO retinas. It may therefore be that the precocious photoreceptor differentiation we observed in the absence of <italic>Pten</italic> occurs due to the reduction in inhibitory <italic>Id3</italic> levels. There may also be a biphasic role for Wnt signaling, as has been observed during neocortical development, where canonical Wnt signaling first induces the symmetric proliferative divisions of neural progenitor cells and later induces differentiation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Harrison-Uy and Pleasure, 2012</xref>). Finally, the ectopic expression of <italic>Wnt2b</italic> inhibits neuronal differentiation in the chick retina (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">Kubo et al., 2005</xref>), phenocopying the postnatal <italic>Pten-</italic>cKO retinal phenotype observed in this study, in which Wnt signaling is also elevated. However, while ectopic <italic>Wnt2b</italic> expression suppresses chick RPC differentiation by inhibiting the expression of proneural genes, we did not observe a significant impact on Notch signaling or proneural gene expression in <italic>Pten</italic>-cKO retinas (data not shown). Thus, the gain of Wnt signaling in <italic>Pten</italic>-cKO retinas impacts RPC proliferation and differentiation possibly in a proneural gene-independent manner.</p><p>The link between glycolysis and Wnt signaling may be species and lineage specific. For instance, in mouse embryos, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib42">Miyazawa et al., 2022</xref> found that increasing glycolysis in the presomitic mesoderm inhibits Wnt signaling. Furthermore, in a study performed in Madin–Darby canine kidney cells, higher pH levels were shown to decrease β-catenin levels in the cytoplasm, nucleus, and junctional complexes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Czowski and White, 2024</xref>). In this study, the authors altered pH using inhibitors for a sodium-proton exchanger and a sodium bicarbonate transporter, in contrast to the <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib44">Oginuma et al., 2020</xref> study, which instead used the ionophores nigericin and valinomycin to equilibrate intracellular pHi to media pH. Consistent with the idea that there is some species specificity, in human retinal organoids, lactate itself was shown to alter optic vesicle bud gene expression, whereas pH did not appear to be an important driver of cell fate decisions (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib59">Takata et al., 2023</xref>). In contrast, in the mouse retina, the GPR81 receptor for lactate is expressed at the highest levels in ganglion cells in which it is required to promote axon growth, with only low, possibly background expression levels in RPCs and photoreceptors (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">Laroche et al., 2021</xref>). In the future, to more comprehensively examine the link between <italic>Pten</italic> loss, glycolytic activity, pHi and Wnt signaling, we could examine levels of phosphorylated, non-phosphorylated and K49 acetylated β-catenin after each manipulation (i.e., <italic>Pten</italic> loss, pH manipulations, CNCn treatment, glycolysis inhibition, and acetate treatments). By collecting CD133<sup>+</sup> MACS-enriched RPCs from the retinal explants, we could add cell type and stage specificity to our analysis. Finally, the use of qPCR to examine Wnt signaling genes, such as <italic>Axin2</italic>, <italic>Ccnd1</italic>, <italic>Myc</italic>, <italic>Sox2</italic>, and <italic>Tnnt3</italic>, would provide further support for the impact of glycolysis and pH on this signaling pathway. Lastly, an important caveat to our study is that metabolism changes ex vivo versus in vivo, and thus, in the future, in vivo studies can be performed to assess metabolic changes.</p></sec><sec id="s3-3"><title>Role of <italic>Pten</italic> in photoreceptor differentiation and maturation</title><p>Our finding that <italic>Pten</italic> loss drives photoreceptor differentiation and OS maturation was an unexpected fate bias given that during development, <italic>Pten</italic> is expressed in multipotent RPCs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib57">Tachibana et al., 2016</xref>) that give rise to all retinal cells in a defined temporal sequence (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Javed and Cayouette, 2017</xref>). RPCs that are biased to a generic photoreceptor fate express the TF Olig2; if these cells later express the TF Nrl, they become rods, if not, they become cones (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Hafler et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Javed and Cayouette, 2017</xref>). In <italic>Pten</italic>-cKO retinas, more RPCs become photoreceptors instead of differentiating into other retinal cell types at early developmental stages (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib57">Tachibana et al., 2016</xref>), but this phenotype is not likely to be dependent on Olig2, since Olig2 is expressed at normal levels from the RNA-seq study performed herein. It is possible that glycolytic inhibition with 2DG slows down the development and production of most newly differentiated cells rather than specifically affecting photoreceptor differentiation, which we could assess in the future. Nevertheless, the finding that <italic>Pten</italic> loss elicits a photoreceptor bias in early-RPCs could have widespread applications in targeting uncurable retinal diseases. Notably, the pharmacological inhibition of PTEN has been used in pre-clinical studies in lung, muscle, and nervous systems for regenerative purposes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Borges et al., 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">Knafo and Esteban, 2017</xref>), including in the retina, to promote ganglion cell axonogenesis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib47">Park et al., 2008</xref>).</p><p>In summary, we have revealed that elevated glycolysis is a key contributor to the RPC fate alterations observed in <italic>Pten-</italic>cKO retinas.

Protein amounts were quantified with a Micro BCA Protein Assay Kit (Thermo Fisher Scientific, #23235) following the manufacturer’s instructions. 10 μg of lysate from whole cells or tissue was run on 10% SDS–PAGE gels for western blot analysis. Protein was transferred to PVDF membrane at 80 V for 1 hr. PVDF membranes were then blocked in 5% skim milk powder in tris-buffered saline with 0.1% tween 20 (TBST) for 1 hr at room temperature. Blots were incubated overnight at 4°C in a blocking solution with non-phosphorylated β-catenin (1:1000, 8814, Cell Signaling) followed by β-actin (1:5000, ab8227, Abcam). Blots were washed 3 × 10 min in TBST before incubating in secondary antibodies, including either Goat Anti-Rabbit IgG (H+L)-HRP Conjugate (1/50,000; Bio-Rad #1721019 or Cell Signaling #7074) or Goat Anti-Mouse IgG (H+L)-HRP Conjugate (1/50,000; Bio-Rad #1721011). A chemiluminescent signal was obtained from the blots using (ECL Prime Luminor Enhancer Solution, Cytiva, Canada) and the blot was developed using a ChemiDoc System (Bio-Rad Laboratories, Canada). Densitometries were calculated using ImageJ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib55">Schneider et al., 2012</xref>), and normalized values (over β-actin) were plotted.</p></sec><sec id="s4-10"><title>scRNA-seq analysis</title><p>10× scRNA-seq data of mouse developing retina were obtained from GSE118614 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Clark et al., 2019</xref>). Further processing and analyses were performed with the Seurat v.3.2.3 R package (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Butler et al., 2018</xref>). Low-quality cells were excluded by filtering out cells with fewer than 500 detected genes and cells with mitochondrial RNA more than 5%. The data were then transformed by the SCTransform function while regressing out the variance due to mitochondrial RNAs. Clustering was performed by the RunPCA, FindNeighbors, and FindClusters functions using the first 30 principal components. The 2D projection of the clustering was carried out by the RunUMAP function. The annotation of cell type to each cluster was performed by using the same set of markers as in <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Clark et al., 2019</xref>. Expression of selected genes was plotted using the FeaturePlot function.</p></sec><sec id="s4-11"><title>Seahorse assay</title><p>P0 <italic>Pten</italic>-cKO and wild-type control pups were sacrificed, and retinal cups were dissected. Both retinas from the same animal were pooled together in one tube and dissociated using a Papain kit according to the manufacture’s protocol (Papain Dissociation System, Worthington Biochemical Corporation, USA). Dissociated cells of each animal were then plated in a 6-well plate coated with poly-<sc>D</sc>-lysine (10 mg/ml) (Corning, 354210)/Laminin (Corning, 354232) (2.5 μg/ml) (Sarstedt, Germany). Cells were cultured for 5 days then transferred to Seahorse 96-well plate at a density of 40,000/well. A Seahorse Mito stress test was run according to the manufacture’s protocol. Seahorse basal media was supplemented with oligomycin, FCCP, R/A at the indicated time points (Seahorse XF Mito Stress Test Kit, 103015-100, Agilent, USA). Readings were then normalized to protein concentration/well measured using the Micro BCA Protein Assay Kit.</p></sec><sec id="s4-12"><title>Lactate assay</title><p>To measure lactate levels, P0 wild-type, <italic>Pten</italic>-cKO, or cytoPFKFB3-GOF retinas were dissected on ice-cold PBS, and both retinas of each pup were pooled together in the same tube. Cell lysates were prepared as described for using NP-40 lysis buffer and protein levels were quantified using the Micro BCA Protein Assay Kit. Measurements of lactate were then performed using a high sensitivity Lactate Colorimetric/Fluorometric Assay Kit as per the manufacturer’s protocol (K607-100; BioVision; CA, USA) and normalized to protein levels.</p></sec><sec id="s4-13"><title>Imaging, quantification, and figure preparation</title><p>Retinal cross sections were imaged using a Leica DM18 inverted fluorescent microscope and Leica Application Suite X (LASX) software for cell counts (Leica Biosystems, Canada) or a Nikon A1 laser scanning confocal microscope at Sunnybrook Research Institute Centre for Cytometry and Scanning Microscopy (Nikon, Canada). OS measurements were performed by imaging three different retinal cross sections stained with rhodopsin (<italic>n</italic> = 3) of each of three different biological replicates (<italic>N</italic> = 3) for each animal group.

The paper presents evidence that high glycolysis in retinal progenitor cells is required for their proliferation and timely differentiation into photoreceptors. Retinal glycolysis increases after deletion of Pten. The authors suggest that high glycolysis controls cell proliferation and differentiation by promoting intracellular alkalinization, beta-catenin acetylation and stabilization and consequent activation of the canonical Wnt pathway.</p><p>Strengths:</p><p>- The experiments showing that PFKFB3 overexpression is sufficient to increase proliferation of retinal progenitors (which are already highly dividing cells) and photoreceptor differentiation are striking and the result unanticipated. It suggests that glycolytic flux is normally limiting for proliferation in embryos.</p><p>- Likewise the result that an increase in pH from 7.4 to 8.0 is sufficient to increase proliferation implies that pH regulation may have instructive roles in setting the tempo of retinal development and embryonic cell proliferation. Similarly for the results showing that acetate supplementation increases proliferation (I think this result should be moved to the main figures).</p><p>Weaknesses:</p><p>- Epistatic experiments to test if changes in pH mediate the effects of glycolysis on photoreceptor differentiation, or if Wnt activation is the main downstream effector of glycolysis in controlling differentiation are not presented.</p><p>- It is likely that metabolism changes ex vivo vs in vivo, and therefore stable isotope tracing experiments in the explants may not reflect in vivo metabolism.</p><p>- The retina at P0 is composed of both progenitors and differentiated cells. It is not clear if the results of the RNA-seq and metabolic analysis reflect changes in the metabolism of progenitors, or of mature cells, or changes in cell type composition rather than direct metabolic changes in a specific cell type.</p><p>- The biochemical links between elevated glycolysis and pH and beta-catenin stability are unclear. White et al found that higher pH decreased beta-catenin stability (JCB 217: 3965) in contrast to the results here. Oginuma et al found that inhibition of glycolysis or beta-catenin acetylation does not affect beta-catenin stability (Nature 584:98), again in contrast to these results. Another paper showed that acidification inhibits Wnt signaling by promoting the expression of a transcriptional repressor and not via beta-catenin stability (Cell Discovery 4:37). There are also additional papers showing increased pH can promote cell proliferation via other mechanisms (e.g. Nat Metab 2:1212). It is possible that there is organ-specificity in these signaling pathways however some clarification of these divergent results is warranted.</p><p>- The gene expression analysis is not completely convincing. E.g. expression of additional glycolytic genes should be shown in Fig. 1. It is not clear why Hk1 and Pgk1 are specifically shown, and conclusions about changes in glycolysis are difficult to draw from expression of these two genes. The increase in glycolytic gene expression in the Pten-deficient retina is generally small.</p><p>- Is it possible that glycolytic inhibition with 2DG slows down development and production of most new differentiated cells rather than specifically affecting photoreceptor differentiation?</p><p>- Are the prematurely-born cells caused by PFKFB3 overexpression photoreceptors as assessed by morphology or markers (in addition to position)?</p></body></sub-article><sub-article article-type="referee-report" id="sa2"><front-stub><article-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.100604.3.sa2</article-id><title-group><article-title>Reviewer #3 (Public review):</article-title></title-group><contrib-group><contrib contrib-type="author"><anonymous/><role specific-use="referee">Reviewer</role></contrib></contrib-group></front-stub><body><p>Summary:</p><p>This study examines the metabolic regulation of progenitor proliferation and differentiation in the developing retina. The authors observe dynamic changes in glycolytic gene expression in retinal progenitors and use various strategies to test the role of glycolysis. They find that elevated glycolysis in Pten-cKO retinas results in alteration of RPC fate, while inhibition of glycolysis has converse effects. They specifically test the role of elevated glycolysis using dominant active cytoPFKFB3, which demonstrates the selective effects of elevated glycolysis on progenitor proliferation and rod differentiation. They then show that elevated glycolysis modulates both pHi and Wnt signaling, and provide evidence that these pathways impact proliferation and differentiation of progenitors, particularly affecting rod photoreceptor differentiation.</p><p>Strengths:</p><p>This is a compelling and rigorous study that provides an important advance in our understanding of metabolic regulation of retina development, addressing a major gap in knowledge. A key strength is that the study utilizes multiple genetic and pharmacological approaches to address how both increased or decreased glycolytic flux affect retinal progenitor proliferation and differentiation. They discover elevated Wnt signaling pathway genes in Pten cKO retina, revealing a potential link between glycolysis and Wnt pathway activation. Altogether the study is comprehensive and adds to the growing body of evidence that regulation of glycolysis plays a key role in tissue development.</p><p>Weaknesses:</p><p>(1) Following expression of cytoPFKFB3, which results in increased glycolytic flux, BrDU labeling was performed at e12.5 and increased labeled cells were detected in the outer nuclear layer. But whether these are cones or rods is not established. The rest of the analysis is focused on the precocious maturation of rhodopsin-labelled outer segments, and the major conclusions emphasize rod photoreceptor differentiation. Therefore it is unclear whether there is an effect on cone differentiation for either Pten cKO or cytoPFKFB3 transgenic retina. It is also not established whether rods are born precociously. Presumably this would be best detected by BrDU labeling at later embryonic stages.</p><p>(2) The authors find that there is upregulation of multiple Wnt pathway components in Pten cKO retina. They further show that inhibiting Wnt signaling phenocopies the effects of reducing glycolysis. However, they do not test whether pharmacological inhibition of Wnt signaling reverses the effects of high glycolytic activity in Pten cKO retinas. Thus the argument that Wnt is a key downstream effector pathway regulating rod photoreceptor differentiation is weak.</p><p>(3) The use of sodium acetate to force protein acetylation is quite non-specific and will have effects beyond beta-catenin acetylation (which the authors acknowledge). Thus it is a stretch to state that &quot;forced activation of beta-catenin acetylation&quot; mimics the impact of Pten</p><p>loss/high glycolytic activity in RPCs since the effects could be due to acetylation of other proteins.</p></body></sub-article><sub-article article-type="author-comment" id="sa3"><front-stub><article-id

Oginuma et al found that inhibition of glycolysis or beta-catenin acetylation does not affect beta-catenin stability (Nature 584:98), again in contrast to these results. Another paper showed that acidification inhibits Wnt signaling by promoting the expression of a transcriptional repressor and not via beta-catenin stability (Cell Discovery 4:37). There are also additional papers showing increased pH can promote cell proliferation via other mechanisms (e.g. Nat Metab 2:1212). It is possible that there is organ-specificity in these signaling pathways however some clarification of these divergent results is warranted.”</p></disp-quote><p>We have added the information and references brought up by the reviewer in our discussion (lines 529-549 and 570-574).

Is that really the case for a mature retina? To address this question, the authors should perform quantifications of photoreceptors at a stage where most developmental cell death has concluded (i.e. at P14 or later; Young, J. Comp. Neurol. 229:362-373, 1984) and check whether or not there are more or less photoreceptors present.</p></disp-quote><p>We have previously quantified numbers of each cell type in <italic>Pten</italic> RPC-cKO retinas, and as suggested by the reviewer, there are fewer rod photoreceptors at P7 (Tachibana et al. 2016. J Neurosci 36 (36) 9454-9471) and P21 (Hanna et al. 2025. IOVS. Mar 3;66(3):45). We have edited the following sentence: “Using cellular birthdating, we previously showed that <italic>Pten</italic>-cKO RPCs are hyperproliferative and differentiate on an accelerated schedule between E12.5 and E18.5, yet fewer rod photoreceptors are ultimately present in P7 (Tachibana et al., 2016) and P21 (Hanna et al., 2025) retinas, suggestive of a developmental defect.

The plots suggest that a high-density time series of gene expression and rod photoreceptor birth was performed, yet it is not clear where and how this was done. The authors should provide the data, plot individual data points, and, if applicable perform a statistical analysis to support their idea that glycolytic gene expression (as a surrogate for glycolysis) overlaps in time with rod photoreceptor birth (Figure 1B) and that in Pten KO the glycolytic gene expression is shifted forward in time (Figure 1H). If the data required to construct these plots (min. 5 data points, min 3 repeats each) does not exist or cannot be generated (e.g. from reanalysis of previously published datasets), then these graphs should be removed.</p></disp-quote><p>We have removed the previous Figure 1B and Figure 1H.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>(3) Figure 2E: Which PKM isozyme was analyzed here? Does the genetic analysis allow us to distinguish between PKM1 and PKM2? Since PKM governs the key rate-limiting step of glycolysis but was not significantly upregulated, does this not contradict the authors' main hypothesis? If PKM at some point was inhibited (see also below comment to Figure 5) one would expect an accumulation of glycolytic intermediates, including phosphoenolpyruvate. Was such an effect observed?</p></disp-quote><p>The data in Figure 2E is bulk RNA-seq data. Since there is only a single <italic>Pkm</italic> gene that is alternatively spliced, the RNA-sequencing data cannot distinguish between the four PK isozymes that arise from alternative splicing. Specifically, we used Illumina NextSeq 500 for sequencing of 75bp Single-End reads that will sequence transcripts for alternatively spliced <italic>Pkm1</italic> and <italic>Pkm2</italic> mRNAs, which carry a common 3’end. We added a statement to this effect: “However, since we employed 75 bp single-end sequencing, we could not distinguish between alternatively spliced <italic>Pkm1</italic> and <italic>Pkm2</italic> mRNAs.“ (lines 215-216).</p><p>We have not performed metabolic analyses of glycolytic intermediates, but we have proposed such a strategy as an important avenue of investigation for future studies in the Discussion: “Lastly, an important caveat to our study is that metabolism changes ex vivo versus in vivo, and thus, in the future, in vivo studies can be performed to assess metabolic changes.” (lines 591-593).</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>(4) Figure 3 and materials &amp; methods: For the retinal explant cultures, was the RPE included in the cultured explants?

The RPE is a metabolic hub that allows transport of nutrients for the retina, so in the absence of the RPE, there is not an immediate source of energy, such as glucose, to the retina. However, the media (DMEM) contains 25 mM glucose to replace the RPE as an energy source, and we now show that RPCs express GLUT1, which allows uptake of glucose (see new Figure 3A).</p><p>We added the following sentence “P0 explants were mounted on Nucleopore membranes and cultured on top of retinal explant media, providing a source of nutrients, growth factors and glucose. “(lines 241-243).</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>(5) Figure 3: It seems rather odd that, if glycolysis was so important for retinal proliferation, differentiation, and metabolism in general, the inhibition of glycolysis with 2DG should not produce a strong degeneration. However, since 2DG competes with glucose, and must be used at nearly equimolar concentration to block glycolysis in a meaningful way, it is possible that the 2DG concentration used simply was not high enough to substantially inhibit glycolysis. Since the inhibitory effect of 2DG depends on the glucose concentration, the authors should measure and provide the concentration of glucose in the explant culture medium. This value should be given either in results or materials and methods.</p></disp-quote><p>We recently published a manuscript showing that 2DG treatments at the same concentrations employed in this study are effective at reducing lactate production in the developing retina in vivo, which is the expected effect of reduced glycolysis (Hanna et al. 2025. IOVS). However, in this study, we did not observe an impact on cell survival.</p><p>We do not agree that it is necessary to measure glucose in the media since the anti-proliferative effect of 2DG is well known, and we are working in the effective range established by multiple groups. We have clarified that we are in the effective range by adding the following sentences: “2DG is typically used in the range of 5-10 mM in cell culture studies and in general, has anti-proliferative effects. To test whether 2DG treatment was in the effective range, explants were exposed to BrdU, which is incorporated into S-phase cells, for 30 minutes prior to harvesting. 2DG treatment resulted in a dose-dependent inhibition of RPC proliferation as evidenced by a reduction in BrdU<sup>+</sup> cells (Figure 3D), indicating that our treatment was in the effective range.” (lines 246-251).</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>(6) Figure 3F: The authors use immunostaining for cleaved, activated caspase-3 to assess the amount of apoptotic cell death. However, there are many different possible mechanisms for neuronal cells to die, the majority of which are caspase-independent. To assess the amount of cell death occurring, the authors should perform a TUNEL assay (which labels apoptotic and non-apoptotic forms of cell death; Grasl-Kraupp et al., Hepatology 21:1465-8, 1995), quantify the numbers of TUNEL-positive cells in the retina, and compare this to the numbers of cells positive for activated caspase-3.</p></disp-quote><p>We agree with the reviewer that there are more ways for a cell to die than just apoptosis, and TUNEL would pick up dying cells that may undergo apoptosis or necrosis, for example, our data with cleaved caspase-3, an executioner protease for apoptosis, provides us with clear evidence of cell death in our different conditions. Since this manuscript is not focused on cell death pathways, we have not performed the additional TUNEL assay.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>(7) Figure 4F and 4I: At post-natal day P7 the rod outer segments (OSs) only just start to grow out and the characteristic, rhodopsin-filled disk stacks are not yet formed. To test whether the PFKFB3 gain-of function or the Pten KO has a marked effect on OS formation and length, the authors should perform the same tests on older, more mature retina at a time when rod OS show their characteristic disk structures (e.g. somewhere between P14 to P30). The same applies to the 2DG inhibition on the Pten KO retina.</p></disp-quote><p>The precocious differentiation of rod outer segments observed in P7 <italic>Pten</italic>-cKO retinas does not persist in adulthood, and instead reflects a developmental acceleration. Indeed, we found that in <italic>Pten</italic> cKO retinas at 3-, 6- and 12-months of age, rod and cone photoreceptors degenerate, and cone outer segments are shorter (Hanna et al., 2025; Tachibana et al., 2016).

It is thus hardly possible to attribute the effects of pH manipulation to any specific enzyme. To assess this and possibly confirm the results obtained with low pH, the authors should perform a targeted inhibition experiment, for instance using Shikonin (Chen et al., Oncogene 30:4297-306, 2011), to selectively inhibit PKM2. If the retinal explant cultures contained the RPE, an additional question would be how the changes in RPE would alter lactate flux and metabolization between RPE and neuroretina (see also question 4 above).</p></disp-quote><p>We have reframed the rationale for the pH manipulation experiments, highlighting the importance of pH in cell fate specification, and indicating that the aggregation of PKM2 is only one possible effect of lower pH.</p><p>We wrote: “Given that altered glycolysis influences intracellular pH, which in turn controls cell fate decisions, we set out to assess the impact of manipulating pH on cell fate selection in the retina.

Important questions concern the use of medium and serum for which the providers, order numbers, and batch/lot numbers (whichever is applicable) must be given. The glucose concentration in the medium (including the serum content) should be measured. A key concern is whether the explants were cultivated submerged into the medium - this would prevent sufficient oxygenation and drive metabolism towards glycolysis (i.e. the Pasteur effect) - or whether they were cultivated on top of the liquid medium, at the interface between air and liquid (i.e. a situation that would favor OXPHOS).</p></disp-quote><p>We have added further detail to the methods section for the explant assay (lines 686-689). We cultured the retinal explants on membranes on top of the media, which is the standard methodology in the field and in our laboratory (Cantrup et al., 2012; Tachibana et al., 2016; Touahri et al., 2024). Typically, RPCs undergo aerobic glycolysis, meaning that even in the presence of oxygen, they still prefer glycolysis rather than OXPHOS. We demonstrated that 2DG blocks RPC proliferation when treated with 2DG, indicating that RPCs are indeed favoring glycolysis in our assay system.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>(12) A point the authors may want to discuss additionally is the potential relevance of their data for the pathogenesis of human diseases, especially early developmental defects such as they occur in oxygen-induced retinopathy of prematurity.</p></disp-quote><p>We would like to thank the reviewer for their valuable comment.
