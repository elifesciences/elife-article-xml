numerous host genes that impact the outcome of infection. Here, we show that infection of human lung epithelial cells with influenza A virus (IAV) also induces a broad program of alternative splicing of host genes. Although these splicing-regulated genes are not enriched for canonical regulators of viral infection, we find that many of these genes do impact replication of IAV. Moreover, in several cases, specific inhibition of the IAV-induced splicing pattern also attenuates viral infection. We further show that approximately a quarter of the IAV-induced splicing events are regulated by hnRNP K, a host protein required for efficient splicing of the IAV M transcript in nuclear speckles. Finally, we find an increase in hnRNP K in nuclear speckles upon IAV infection, which may alter accessibility of hnRNP K for host transcripts thereby leading to a program of host splicing changes that promote IAV replication.</p></abstract><kwd-group kwd-group-type="author-keywords"><kwd>virus infection</kwd><kwd>alternative splicing</kwd><kwd>hnRNP K</kwd><kwd>influenza</kwd></kwd-group><kwd-group kwd-group-type="research-organism"><title>Research organism</title><kwd>Human</kwd></kwd-group><funding-group><award-group id="fund2"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000002</institution-id><institution>National Institutes of Health</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>R01 AI125524</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Thompson</surname><given-names>Matthew G</given-names></name><name><surname>Bhat</surname><given-names>Prasanna</given-names></name><name><surname>Fontoura</surname><given-names>Beatriz MA</given-names></name><name><surname>Lynch</surname><given-names>Kristen W</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund1"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000002</institution-id><institution>National Institutes of Health</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>R35 GM118048</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Thompson</surname><given-names>Matthew G</given-names></name><name><surname>Mallory</surname><given-names>Michael J</given-names></name><name><surname>Ferretti</surname><given-names>Max B</given-names></name><name><surname>Lynch</surname><given-names>Kristen W</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund3"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000002</institution-id><institution>National Institutes of Health</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>R01 AI150246</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Dittmar</surname><given-names>Mark</given-names></name><name><surname>Cherry</surname><given-names>Sara</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund4"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000002</institution-id><institution>National Institutes of Health</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>R01 AI122749</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Dittmar</surname><given-names>Mark</given-names></name><name><surname>Cherry</surname><given-names>Sara</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund5"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000002</institution-id><institution>National Institutes of Health</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>R01 AI140539</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Dittmar</surname><given-names>Mark</given-names></name><name><surname>Cherry</surname><given-names>Sara</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><funding-statement>The funders had no role in study design, data collection and interpretation, or the decision to submit the work for publication.</funding-statement></funding-group><custom-meta-group><custom-meta specific-use="meta-only"><meta-name>Author impact statement</meta-name><meta-value>Infection of human cells by influenza A virus induces changes in the alternative splicing of host genes that, in turn, promote viral replication.</meta-value></custom-meta></custom-meta-group></article-meta></front><body><sec id="s1" sec-type="intro"><title>Introduction</title><p>Influenza A virus (IAV) is a ubiquitous and significant health threat, resulting in 290,000–650,000 deaths per year worldwide (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib60">WHO, 2019</xref>). In the United States alone, IAV is estimated to result 12,000–56,000 deaths annually (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, 2020</xref>), with an estimated $11.2 billion cost burden (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib47">Putri et al., 2018</xref>). While efforts are ongoing to treat the virus, there still is no universal prevention or cure. This lack of treatment is due, in part, to the virus’s ability to rapidly mutate and develop resistance (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Hussain et al., 2017</xref>). Therefore, it is important to further understand how IAV and host cells interact during infection in order to develop new avenues for antiviral therapies.</p><p>IAV infection results in large changes to the host gene expression landscape. Our understanding of these changes has largely been shaped through studies using microarray technology, limiting analyses to the measurement of transcript abundance. However, several recent studies have utilized advances in next-generation sequencing to observe host and viral gene expression during infection in greater detail than ever before. For example, IAV infection has been shown to induce a range of gene expression phenotypes such as RNA polymerase readthrough (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Bauer et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Heinz et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib61">Zhao et al., 2018</xref>), translational shutoff (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Bercovich-Kinori et al., 2016</xref>), altered genome architecture (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Heinz et al., 2018</xref>), and targeted transcript degradation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Gaucherand et al., 2019</xref>). In addition, a recent transcriptome-wide study identified not only transcript abundance changes but also global changes in alternative splicing isoforms (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Fabozzi et al., 2018</xref>). These observations are in agreement with a growing awareness that viral infection can not only alter gene expression but also lead to altered splicing patterns.</p><p>Host splicing changes have been observed during infection with DNA viruses (HSV-1 [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Hu et al., 2016</xref>], HCMV [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Batra et al., 2016</xref>]) as well as RNA viruses such as reovirus (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Boudreault et al., 2016</xref>), dengue virus (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib49">Sessions et al., 2013</xref>), and zika virus (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Hu et al., 2017</xref>), and recently, SARS-CoV-2 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Banerjee et al., 2020</xref>). However, these studies represent only the tip of the iceberg as they have mostly lacked the sequencing depth, and subsequent orthogonal validation, that is needed for a comprehensive quantitative analysis of host splicing (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib42">Mehmood et al., 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib50">Shen et al., 2012</xref>). Therefore, we set out to comprehensively define the scope of host splicing changes during IAV infection in order to begin to address the underlying mechanisms and functional implications of such viral-induced alterations to the host transcriptome.</p><p>Mechanistically, changes in host splicing under any condition are generally due to regulation of RNA-binding proteins that, in turn, control the host splicing machinery. Splicing factors bind at a myriad of sites throughout a nascent pre-mRNA, and influence the inclusion or exclusion of specific exons, and in some cases introns, by influencing the recruitment of spliceosomal components to splice sites (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Fu and Ares, 2014</xref>). In some cases, it has been shown that that viruses directly interact with the splicing machinery to alter splice site choice. For example, dengue virus NS5 alters splicing through interaction with the U5 snRNP (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">De Maio et al., 2016</xref>) component of the spliceosome, the piconaviral RdRp interacts with RNA helicase Prp8 to stall splicing (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">Liu et al., 2014</xref>), and SARS-CoV-2 Nsp16 has been proposed to bind U1 and U2 snRNA (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Banerjee et al., 2020</xref>). Viruses can also influence the localization and/or expression of splicing factors, as has been observed in poliovirus (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Álvarez et al., 2013</xref>), rotavirus (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Dhillon et al., 2018</xref>), alphavirus (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Barnhart et al., 2013</xref>), HCV (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib53">Shwetha et al., 2015</xref>), picornavirus (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Florez et al., 2005</xref>), HCMV (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Batra et al., 2016</xref>), and Dengue virus (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib45">Pozzi et al., 2020</xref>) and the resulting change in the nuclear concentration of splicing regulatory proteins likely contributes to alternative splicing of host genes. In the case of IAV, however, it is unclear how and if viral interactions with the splicing machinery impact host splicing patterns. While it is known that the IAV protein NS1 inhibits splicing in vitro through interaction with the spliceosomal U6 snRNA, the relevance of this interaction in cells has not been shown (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib48">Qiu et al., 1995</xref>).</p><p>Here, we demonstrate that infection of human cells with IAV induces widespread alternative splicing changes in host genes. Similar changes in splicing are not observed upon treatment with interferon, demonstrating that this program of IAV-induced splicing is a direct consequence of viral infection rather than a secondary bystander effect of the host innate immune response. Importantly, at least 30 of the 61 genes tested that harbor IAV-induced splicing events influence IAV infection. Directly manipulating splicing of several of these transcripts confirmed that IAV-induced changes in alternative splicing have direct consequences on viral replication. Mechanistically, we found that almost 25% of the IAV-induced splicing changes are also regulated by hnRNP K, a well-known splicing regulator whose subnuclear distribution we show to be altered upon IAV infection. Previously, we demonstrated that hnRNP K promotes splicing of the IAV M segment transcript to generate the M2 protein (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib43">Mor et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib54">Thompson et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib55">Tsai et al., 2013</xref>). This suggests that the virus co-opts hnRNP K to promote infection both directly by inducing viral gene splicing and indirectly by altering hnRNP K splicing on pro-viral transcripts altogether promoting replication. Altogether, this work demonstrates the importance of alternative splicing for robust infection and replication of IAV and suggests mechanisms for how such viral-induced regulation of host splicing is achieved.</p></sec><sec id="s2" sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><sec id="s2-1"><title>Host gene expression changes are induced upon IAV A/WSN/33 infection</title><p>As a first step toward understanding the impact of IAV infection on the transcriptome, human epithelial A549 cells were infected with IAV A/WSN/33 at a multiplicity of infection (moi) of 2, to yield ~90% infection of cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Condit, 2013</xref>), and total RNA was isolated at 0, 6, and 12 hr post infection (HPI).

GO analysis of the 2549 genes differentially expressed at both 6 and 12 HPI (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1c</xref>, green overlap) also showed the expected enrichment for host response to virus. We further confirmed the robust induction of individual genes that are frequently used as markers of the innate antiviral immune response by RT-qPCR at both 6 and 12 HPI (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1e</xref>). Together these data show that under the conditions of our experiment, IAV A/WSN/33 infection induces a robust host innate immune response within 6 hr. By 12 HPI, we observe a further progression of infection and a corresponding stress response in the host.</p></sec><sec id="s2-2"><title>Influenza A/WSN/33 infection results in differential splicing of host transcripts</title><p>Next, we quantified global changes in host splicing changes using a previously established algorithm, MAJIQ, that identifies all standard splicing events as well as complex splicing patterns (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib58">Vaquero-Garcia et al., 2016</xref>). Importantly, the detection of splicing by MAJIQ is not based on any pre-determined identification of exons, rather MAJIQ can identify any de novo pattern of splicing observed in the RNA-Seq reads (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib58">Vaquero-Garcia et al., 2016</xref>). At 6 HPI, we identified 1162 splicing differences at 861 unique genes with a threshold for changes in percent isoform expression (∆PSI) of greater than or equal to 10% (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2a,b</xref>). Using an even more stringent cut-off of 20% ΔPSI, we found 1931 splicing changes at 12 HPI, 896 of which overlapped with those splicing events observed to vary at 6 hr (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2a,b</xref>; lists of all splicing changes are provided in <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="supp2">Supplementary file 2</xref>). We used a more stringent threshold at 12 HPI based on the fact that when plotting the ∆PSI values of the overlapping 896 splicing changes against each other, we see a trend in which splicing changes increase during the course of infection (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s1">Figure 2—figure supplement 1</xref>). This trend in increased ∆PSI over time is consistent with host splicing being regulated directly in response to viral load.

Notably, only 43 of these genes also exhibit changes in abundance upon viral infection (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2c</xref>), consistent with many other studies that have found that genes regulated by splicing and transcription are largely distinct (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Gazzara et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">Ip et al., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib52">Shinde et al., 2017</xref>). Moreover, GO analysis of the 588 genes that are differentially spliced without changes in abundance, finds an enrichment for genes associated with RNA processing, not immune defense (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2d</xref>). In summary, IAV infection induces a host splicing program that is functionally distinct from the host transcriptional response.</p><p>To focus on genes that are regulated solely by splicing and not expression we have removed the 43 differentially spliced and expressed genes from our list of splicing events in the remainder of our analysis, leaving 833 distinct splicing changes in 588 genes. These 833 overlapping splicing events were then categorized by the type of alternative splicing (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2e</xref>). Of the alternative splicing events, ~25% are ‘classic’ splicing events falling into alternative 5′ splice site, alternative 3′ splice site, and simple cassette exon events (211 splicing changes total). We also find many events classified as either complex or uncategorized, consistent with previous studies using MAJIQ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib58">Vaquero-Garcia et al., 2016</xref>). While interesting, these complex events are challenging to explore in terms of functional consequence or mechanism (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib58">Vaquero-Garcia et al., 2016</xref>). Therefore, we focused our subsequent studies on the more canonical splicing events.</p></sec><sec id="s2-3"><title>Infection-induced splicing events encode proteins important for IAV replication</title><p>We next investigated the role of the genes harboring viral-regulated splicing events in viral infection, focusing on the 211 classic splicing events (single exon cassettes, alternative 5′ splice site, and alternative 3′ splice site) due to their robustness and ease of analysis by RT-PCR (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2e</xref>).

Notably, we found that knockdown of five of these seven genes resulted in dramatic (≥5.5 fold) decreases of infectious viral particles (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3d</xref>).

In other words, in contrast to the experiments in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3</xref> in which the complete gene was targeted, we sought to test the functional impact of specifically blocking expression of the viral-induced isoform. To do so, we employed a previously established approach in which antisense morpholino oligonucleotides (AMO’s) are targeted to the exon-intron boundaries of alternative exons, promoting the skipping of the targeted exons (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Fiszbein et al., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">Mallory et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib41">Martinez et al., 2015</xref>). By employing this strategy, splicing events where splice site usage is increased upon viral infection can be blocked, inhibiting expression solely of the isoform that is favored upon infection. Importantly, this strategy does not impact translation of the target mRNAs, as the AMOs only interact with the pre-mRNA. Of the 30 alternatively spliced genes shown to alter viral replication (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3b–d</xref>), 11 exhibited increased exon inclusion upon IAV infection.

Levels of viral replication were measured by RT-qPCR assaying vRNA levels (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4b</xref>). In addition, infectious particles were measured via plaque assay (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4c</xref>). CREB1, IQCB1, and REPIN1 AMO treatment resulted in little to no change at the viral titer or vRNA level compared to mock treatments (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4b,c</xref>). However, remarkably, switching the splicing of ERI2, CLK1, RAB11FIP3, and PPIP5K2 by AMO resulted in significant changes of at least twofold at both the titer and vRNA level (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4b,c</xref>) with no general toxicity to the cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s1">Figure 4—figure supplement 1</xref>). Notably, forced skipping of the CLK1 variable exon is predicted to have the same impact at siRNA treatment, as the exon-skipped product is predicted to be targeted for NMD (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s1">Figure 4—figure supplement 1</xref>). By contrast, both the exon-included and -skipped isoforms of RAB11FIP3, PPIP5K2, and ERI2 are predicted to encode active proteins (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s1">Figure 4—figure supplement 1</xref>). The results from the AMO experiment strongly suggest that the exon-included isoform of RAB11FIP3 and PPIP5K2 specifically promotes viral growth and/or that the exon-skipped product inhibits viral replication. Similarly for ERI2, viral infection normally favors the shorter isoform, while inhibition of this isoform in favor of the longer version markedly inhibits viral infection and replication. Although the impact of splicing modulation of CLK1, RAP11FIP3 and PPIP5K2 are relatively modest, given that several splicing changes occur at once during IAV infection, we also tested whether modifying multiple splicing changes simultaneously would have additive effects. Indeed, a combination AMO treatment targeting CLK1, RAB11FIP3, and PPIP5K2 splicing together, resulted in a larger decrease in viral titer compared to any of these single AMO treatments (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4d</xref>; ~fourfold instead of ~twofold). Together, these data show that direct alteration of host splicing events upon viral infection impacts viral replication, at least for a subset of genes. Even for those genes in which we do not observe a direct functional impact of viral-induced splicing (e.g. IQCB1), it is possible that splicing regulation contributes to gene function and viral replication in a manner that is beyond the detection of our current assays.</p></sec><sec id="s2-5"><title>hnRNP K regulates a subset of influenza A sensitive splicing events</title><p>We next set out to investigate how IAV infection impacts alternative splicing. We focused on the host protein hnRNP K because it was previously shown to be a pro-viral factor that regulates splicing of IAV M segment RNA (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib43">Mor et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib54">Thompson et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib55">Tsai et al., 2013</xref>).

Therefore, we first tested if hnRNP K is important for IAV replication independent of its regulation of M segment splicing. In previous work, we generated an IAV mutant strain in which hnRNP K cannot bind to the M segment to regulate splicing (∆K-mut; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib54">Thompson et al., 2018</xref>). To determine if hnRNP K regulates IAV replication in the context of this virus, we depleted hnRNP K in A549 cells using siRNAs and assayed infectious virus particles 48 hr post-infection. Importantly, we show that while the ∆K-mut IAV M2 splicing is no longer sensitive to hnRNP K levels, viral propagation is still attenuated upon hnRNP K knockdown (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5a</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5s1">Figure 5—figure supplement 1</xref>).

Splicing changes that occur in response to hnRNP K knockdown were quantified using MAJIQ, filtering for significant changes of 10% or more in percent splicing (ΔPSI). In agreement with previous studies, we observe large changes in host splicing upon hnRNP K depletion (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="supp2">Supplementary file 2</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib54">Thompson et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib59">Venables et al., 2008</xref>). Importantly, 21% of the influenza-induced splicing changes are also hnRNP K-responsive (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5c</xref>). To determine if hnRNP K positively or negatively regulates splicing of the IAV-dependent splicing events, we plotted the impact of hnRNP K and IAV infection on PSI values of the 179 common splicing events (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5d</xref>). We find 65% of splicing changes are regulated similarly by hnRNP K depletion and IAV infection, whereas for the remainder, hnRNP K depletion has the opposite effect of infection. We validated many of these splicing changes in response to both IAV infection and hnRNP K knockdown by RT-PCR, including both those that exhibit a similar and an opposite change under these two conditions (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4a</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s1">Figure 2—figure supplement 1</xref>). The observed high validation rates are consistent with previous studies with MAJIQ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib58">Vaquero-Garcia et al., 2016</xref>). In addition to hnRNP K-induced regulation of splicing, we also find that hnRNP K alters the expression of ~2000 genes, some of which are also altered upon viral infection (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5s2">Figure 5—figure supplement 2</xref>, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="supp1">Supplementary file 1</xref>). These hnRNP K regulated genes are generally independent of hnRNP K regulated splicing events (8% of splicing events are differentially expressed, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5s2">Figure 5—figure supplement 2</xref>). Some of these changes in gene expression may contribute to regulation of IAV infection. However, as there is no enrichment for viral-related functions among the hnRNP K-induced differentially expressed genes (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5s2">Figure 5—figure supplement 2</xref>), and our focus here is on splicing. We have not further pursued the impact of this differential expression.</p></sec><sec id="s2-6"><title>hnRNP K nuclear distribution is altered during infection</title><p>Based on the two populations of hnRNP K and IAV-responsive splicing events, we propose at least two models for how hnRNP K-dependent splicing is regulated during infection. The abundance of splicing events for which hnRNP K depletion phenocopies infection at the splicing level suggests that hnRNP K may be functionally depleted or inhibited during infection. By contrast, for events with opposite ΔPSI values between hnRNP K depletion and infection, hnRNP K activity may be enhanced by a co-factor that is increased or activated upon infection. Both these models imply a change to hnRNP K activity upon infection. However, western blot analysis revealed little to no differences in hnRNP K expression or nucleocytoplasmic localization (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6a</xref>).

In past work, we showed that hnRNP K activates IAV M RNA splicing within nuclear speckles, as opposed to the nucleoplasm where most splicing of host transcripts is thought to occur (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib43">Mor et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib54">Thompson et al., 2018</xref>). Therefore, we asked if the speckle-associated pool of hnRNP K is altered during IAV infection. To test this, hnRNP K colocalization with nuclear speckle-associated protein, SC35, was measured using fluorescence microscopy in mock and IAV-infected A549 cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6b–c</xref>). Strikingly, we observed that hnRNP K levels at nuclear speckles increase modestly but significantly during IAV infection (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6d</xref>). This increase in localization of hnRNP K to speckles was mirrored by an overall increase in speckle size upon infection (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6e</xref>). Therefore, we propose that at least one of the mechanisms by which IAV results in alterations in hnRNP K-regulated splicing events is through enhanced recruitment of hnRNP K to nuclear speckles. Although this re-localization may not be sufficient to have a gross impact on the overall levels of hnRNP K in the nucleoplasm, it is possible that this re-localization, coupled with competition for hnRNP K between IAV and host RNAs, effectively depletes a particular pool of hnRNP K from co-transcriptional splicing processes in the nucleoplasm, or redirects hnRNP K activity to splicing events that occur at nuclear speckles (see Discussion). Regardless of the mechanism, we do find that upon depletion of hnRNP K from cells, there is no further change in the splicing of hnRNP K- and IAV-dependent events upon IAV infection (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6s1">Figure 6—figure supplement 1</xref>). While we cannot rule out that the lack of IAV-induced splicing is an indirect result of reduced infection efficiency, these results are consistent with our model that reduced hnRNP K activity is the primary driver of a subset of IAV-induced host splicing.</p></sec></sec><sec id="s3" sec-type="discussion"><title>Discussion</title><p>Previous studies have established that the host transcriptome is profoundly altered upon IAV infection.

Genes that exhibit differential expression are enriched for genes involved in immune response and viral defense, consistent with previous studies (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Fabozzi et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">Ioannidis et al., 2012</xref>). By contrast, GO analyses of genes that harbor splicing changes demonstrates enrichment for RNA processing categories. Moreover, we observe very little overlap between the genes that are differentially spliced versus those that show differential expression. These data suggest that the host splicing response to virus is functionally distinct from the transcriptional response. We are unable to directly compare our data to other RNA-Seq studies due to differential experimental design and depth of sequence; however, our findings are generally consistent with the prediction that IAV infection induces changes in host splicing in addition to, and separate from, changes in transcription. Patterns similar to this have been observed in other systems. For example, T-cell stimulation results in robust transcriptional and splicing changes; however, very little overlap is observed between the categories (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib40">Martinez et al., 2012</xref>).</p><p>Our analyses of host splicing changes adds to a pattern of IAV inducing a variety transcriptomic phenotypes. Recent studies observing altered genome architecture, transcript 3′ end defects, and PA-X targeted transcript degradation during infection all have links to splicing (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Gaucherand et al., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Heinz et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib61">Zhao et al., 2018</xref>). One observation was that of transgenic, defective, and unannotated splicing in relation to transcription termination (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Heinz et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib61">Zhao et al., 2018</xref>). While our splicing analyses did not account for these specific splicing types, we would predict for them to be present in our experiments to some extent. Importantly, the alternatively spliced transcripts we describe here are not products of defective or transgenic splicing, and are likely not induced by the same transcription defects described in other studies. Additionally, the IAV endonuclease PA-X was shown to preferentially target spliced transcripts (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Gaucherand et al., 2019</xref>). However, the alternatively spliced genes we define here do not overlap with PA-X-targeted genes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Gaucherand et al., 2019</xref>). Therefore, while splicing appears to contribute to many facets of IAV-induced transcriptome changes, we propose that a portion of the functional splicing events described here are independent of previously described mechanisms.</p><p>Although the set of genes that we identify to undergo alternative splicing upon IAV infection are not enriched for known regulators of viral replication, we demonstrate that half of the splicing-regulated genes we tested (30/61) do impact IAV infection or propagation. This includes genes involved in cell signaling, intracellular trafficking and gene expression. In addition to demonstrating that many of the host genes that undergo IAV-induced splicing changes are involved in controlling infection, in several cases we directly show that changing the splicing of these genes alters IAV replication (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4</xref>). For example, IAV infection induces inclusion of alternative CLK1 exon 4, which results in expression of the canonical full-length isoform of the protein (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4a</xref>). By contrast, skipping of exon 4 is observed in uninfected cells and introduces an early stop codon that truncates the kinase domain of protein (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Duncan et al., 1997</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib56">Uzor et al., 2018</xref>). Therefore, in the case of CLK1, both the AMO that blocks exon 4 inclusion (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4</xref>), and the siRNA (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3</xref>), are expected to decrease the expression of active protein. Given that previous studies have established CLK1 to be required for efficient IAV replication (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Artarini et al., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Karlas et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib62">Zu et al., 2015</xref>), our data is consistent with a model in which IAV infection promotes exon inclusion to increase production of full-length functional CLK1 kinase that, in turn, promotes viral growth.</p><p>For RAB11FIP3, IAV induces the inclusion of a non-canonical in-frame alternative exon (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4a</xref>), resulting in expression of an alternate isoform of this protein. The function of the additional protein sequence remains unclear, as it lies upstream of the defined RAB11-binding domain (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib51">Shiba et al., 2006</xref>) and does not contain known phosphorylation sites (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Collins et al., 2012</xref>). Regardless, this non-canonical isoform appears to promote IAV infection, as blocking the variable exon up-regulates the canonical isoform and limits IAV replication in multi-cycle infections (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4b</xref>). Interestingly, a previously established model suggests that RAB11FIP3 may compete with IAV vRNPs for RAB11 on endosomes in the particle assembly pathway (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib57">Vale-Costa et al., 2016</xref>). Therefore, it is possible that the canonical RAB11FIP3 isoforms may interfere with particle assembly, such that it is beneficial to the virus for this canonical isoform to be decreased through splicing.</p><p>PPIP5K2 exon inclusion is also increased upon viral infection, producing increased levels of the canonical full-length isoform of the RNA (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4a</xref>). By contrast, forced skipping of this exon results in decreases in viral titers and vRNA (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4a–c</xref>). Interestingly, PPIP5K2 has been previously thought to limit to influenza A replication (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib46">Pulloor et al., 2014</xref>), as it was shown that catalytic activity of PPIP5K2 is required for efficient IFNβ production, and in turn, that knockdown of PPIP5K2 resulted in viral load increases. The exon that is skipped in uninfected cells removes a portion of peptide sequence without altering the downstream reading frame. It is possible that the resultant smaller protein has increased catalytic activity, perhaps through removal of an inhibitory interaction, such that altering the splicing of PPIP5K2 may reduce PPIP5K2 function.</p><p>ERI2 is a particularly interesting example of IAV-induced alternative splicing. The ERI2 gene encodes a poorly characterized exonuclease that is a member of a family of non-specific 3′ to 5′ exonucleases that target double-stranded RNA or DNA (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Dominski et al., 2003</xref>). Use of an alternative 3′ splice site in the terminal exon results in a swap between two unique C-termini. The distal 3′ splice site, which is favored upon IAV infection, results in a 35 amino acid terminus, while use of the proximal 3′ splice site adds an additional 392 amino acids. Both isoforms contain the exonuclease domain, however the longer form also contains a putative nucleic-acid-binding zinc finger. While the functional role of this protein is unknown, we do note that it was identified in a broad siRNA screen as required for efficient HIV infection (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Brass et al., 2008</xref>). Thus, the activity of this protein, its relevance for viral infection, and the functional difference between isoforms, will be an interesting area for future study.</p><p>Importantly, we show a previously established pro-viral host factor, hnRNP K, regulates a subset of the splicing events that change in response to IAV infection, including CLK1, RAB11FIP3, and PPIP5K2. Notably, hnRNP K undergoes increased sequestration into nuclear speckles upon viral infection. While the overall percentage of hnRNP K in the speckles remains low even after infection, given the plethora of targets of hnRNP K in the nucleus, including the IAV M transcript, it is reasonable that the redistribution of hnRNP K upon infection may alter the pool of free hnRNP K available to bind to and regulate host genes that are typically spliced outside of speckles. Further consistent with a functional role of hnRNP K in regulating important pro-viral host splicing events, while hnRNP K was previously established to be important for IAV M segment splicing regulation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib43">Mor et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib54">Thompson et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib55">Tsai et al., 2013</xref>), IAV replication is sensitive to hnRNP K expression even in the context of a mutant IAV in which hnRNP K is not required for M segment splicing regulation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5a</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5s1">Figure 5—figure supplement 1</xref>). It is possible, however, that hnRNP K is also important for additional viral processes such as regulating transcription or translation of viral transcripts, as hnRNP K has been implicated to regulate many facets of RNA processing other than splicing (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Bomsztyk et al., 2004</xref>). Nonetheless, given that hnRNP K levels regulate 21% of detected IAV-induced splicing changes (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5c</xref>), many of which encode for proteins that influence viral replication (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3c</xref>), we contend that hnRNP K regulation of host transcript splicing is an important process during IAV infection.</p><p>While our data clearly shows changes in host splicing upon IAV infection (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2</xref>), many of which are regulated by host splicing factor hnRNP K (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5c</xref>), it is not clear if these splicing changes are induced through host or viral mechanisms. A virus-centric model would suggest that viral manipulation of host splicing-related pathways causes the splicing changes observed during infection. By contrast, a host-centric model would predict the splicing changes observed during infection are part of a host response to pathogen. Likely, the changes we observe here are a mixture of both models. However, RT-PCR analysis of a panel of IAV-sensitive splicing events in the context of IFNβ treatment identified no significant splicing changes, thus ruling out a model in which splicing changes are primarily triggered indirectly by interferon secretion, as a secondary consequence of the innate immune response.</p><p>In sum, we demonstrate here a feedback loop between viral-induced regulation of splicing of host genes and subsequent viral infection. This is yet another example of the intricate competition between host and virus, involving multiple layers of regulation and counter-regulation<sup>53,54</sup>. We also demonstrate one of the mechanisms driving this IAV-induced regulation of splicing. Future studies will be required to further uncover additional underlying mechanisms by which IAV control host splicing, and to determine if manipulation of these mechanisms has potential for antiviral therapeutic intervention.</p></sec><sec id="s4" sec-type="materials|methods"><title>Materials and methods</title><sec id="s4-1"><title>Cell culture and viruses</title><p>Human lung adenocarcinoma epithelial cells (A549) were cultured in RPMI 1640 (Corning: 10–040-CV), 10% heat-inactivated FBS (Gibco: 16000–044), and 100 units ml−1 Pen/Strep antibiotics.

Performing RNA sequencing and quantifying splicing changes they make the interesting observation that genes that were differentially regulated at the transcription level were mostly found in the antiviral response and DNA repair pathways while the genes that were differentially spliced were mostly found in splicing and mRNA transport pathways. They catalogued the types of splicing changes and focused on a set of splicing events for mechanistic studies. Using siRNAs to knockdown expression and antisense morpholino oligonucleotides (AMO) to drive splicing pattern changes, they determined the effects of particular genes and isoforms on influenza viral replication and production. Finally, the authors showed that hnRNPK is a regulatory factor for 21% of the altered splicing events during influenza virus infection. These events are possibly controlled by increased recruitment of hnRNP K to nuclear speckles during infection.</p><p>This study is one of the first to comprehensively quantify host splicing changes during viral infection. The authors clearly demonstrated effects on viral replication and production by modulating the splicing of some of these host transcripts, suggesting that these splicing events play an important role during viral infection. The authors also briefly mention in the Discussion that IFN treatment did not trigger similar splicing changes. Thus, the splicing changes may be an outcome of viral infection rather than a host response to pathogens.</p><p>All the reviewers found the paper to be interesting and important and the manuscript to be well written. However, they also agreed that the significance of the findings is weakened by the lack of method validation and essential controls. Moreover, several puzzling aspects of the results require more detailed explanation.</p><p>Essential revisions:</p><p>1) There is no data presented to confirm the knockdowns by either qRT-PCR or immunoblotting. Granted it is a significant amount of work to validate the 61 alternatively spliced candidate genes by siRNAs. However, without this data it impossible to assess possible correlations between the phenotype and the degree of knockdown. Given the complex phenotype assayed (viral infection) it is critical to consider off target effects of siRNAs. Although the experience of the collaborators suggests this was done properly, it should nonetheless be addressed explicitly in the study. The authors are no doubt aware that siRNA screens are plagued by high false positive rates. To manage these off-target effects, the authors need to validate the important hits using individual siRNAs. As better proof that the siRNAs are specific, the authors should consider using C911 siRNA controls (Buehler et al., PLoS ONE 2012) and determine whether these abrogate the transcript knockdowns and effects on viral replication. It would be worth testing these controls for the 5 genes (CLK1, RAB11FIP3, PPIP5K2, REPIN1 and IQCB1), for which the effects of splicing changes on viral replication and production were tested in Figure 4. Given that the effects seen from the siRNA screen (Figure 3B) were modest, and indeed the criterion for selecting hits at 20% inhibition was relaxed, it would be more convincing if all of the 61 factors or at least the most promising ones were additionally tested for decrease in formation of progeny viruses (as in Figure 3D).</p><p>2) The parallel discussion of the siRNA and AMO data was confusing and more in-depth description of the results is needed. Two of the genes (CLK1 and RAB11FIP3) that showed a significant difference in viral replication and production upon efficient AMO targeting are genes that showed the smallest reduction in viral replication upon siRNA knockdown. Without more information on the siRNAs and the efficiency of the knockdowns, it is difficult to draw conclusions about what the individual genes and splicing events might do. For example, do the CLK1 siRNAs target the exon that was skipped by AMO targeting and therefore both siRNA and AMO treatment gave the same viral phenotype? On the other hand, IQCB1 gave the greatest reduction in viral replication upon siRNA targeting but did not have any effects upon AMO targeting. What does this mean – perhaps that both isoforms are needed for viral replication? The functional consequences of the AS events could only be tested for 11 genes that showed increased exon inclusion on IAV infection. Of these 5 could be modulated (CLK1, RAB11FIP3, PPIP5K2, IQCB1, and REPIN1) – and of these only IQCB1 had an effect greater than 50% upon knockdown. While knockdown of all isoforms may not predict the effect of splice modulation, why not modulate the splicing of genes that showed the most dramatic effect upon knockdown (e.g., ERI2)? In cases where genes showed decreased exon inclusion, could ectopically expressing different isoforms affect viral replication?</p><p>3) The authors assert that hnRNP K accumulates to higher levels in nuclear speckles during IAV infection by performing immunofluorescence (IFA) (Figure 6). However, differences in hnRNPK localization +/- IAV was not evident in the IFA images provided. The quantification in Figure 6D suggests there are subtle differences, but these are not easily discerned upon visual inspection of Figure 6C. The authors should consider other means to quantify the immunofluorescence, perhaps by measuring the variance in the fluorescence across the nucleus. Another important control here is to perform a similar analysis on SC35 to assess the possibility that IAV infection increases the size of the nuclear speckles (and thus all proteins in them). Are these changes specific to hnRNPK? hnRNPK is highly abundant, so how to determine if a slight increase in its nuclear speckle concentration is functionally relevant? Do small changes in its overall concentration affect splicing? Some of these issues will be difficult to address, but the interpretations of the data should consider them.</p><p>4) The link between hnRNPK and splicing changes that occur during IAV infection is supported mostly by correlational data (Figure 5); direct evidence that hnRNPK activity is responsible for the IAV-induced splicing changes is lacking. A more direct link might be provided by analyzing a panel of genes that undergo similar isoform shifts during IAV infection and hnRNPK knockdown. Among such genes, does knock down of hnRNPK in IAV infected vs. uninfected cells lead to an additive effect on PSI changes or no further change (suggesting hnRNPK is the primary means by which IAV alters splicing)? Similarly, given that the ∆K-mut IAV appears to be more sensitive to hnRNP K depletion than wt IAV (Figure 4A), perhaps splicing modulation of certain genes would reveal a stronger phenotype in ∆K-mut infection.</p><p>5) The authors did not cite or discuss several papers that are pertinent to this study that have also profiled IAV-induced host gene expression changes at multiple levels (transcription, splicing, mRNA turnover, translation). Some examples: Bercovich-Kinori et al., 2016, performed RNA-Seq and ribosome profiling in IAV-infected cells, showing a prominent host shutoff phenotype. Bauer et al., 2018, used NETseq to study host transcription during IAV infection. Gaucherand et al., 2019, directly assessed the impact of IAV infection on the accumulation of spliced host transcripts, showing that the flu PA-X protein degrades spliced transcripts more efficiently than unspliced transcripts, and this is mediated through interactions between PA-X and proteins involved in splicing including hnRNPK. Some of these studies used PR8 rather than WSN, but WSN (because of its NS1-mediated targeting of Pol2) should have an even more prominent effect on host mRNA depletion. This previous work provides an essential background for the study presented here and should be discussed.</p><p>6) The authors contend that the changes in AS were not due to innate immune mechanisms because these changes were not seen with IFN treatment. The authors should consider that the innate immunity observed early in viral infection (in the case of flu 6-12 h pi) is best modeled by combined IFN treatment and dsRNA activation, not IFN alone. In future studies, it would also be interesting to test influenza virus mutants that are unable to antagonize the IFN response and see what types of splicing changes occur.</p></body></sub-article><sub-article article-type="reply" id="sa2"><front-stub><article-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.55500.sa2</article-id><title-group><article-title>Author response</article-title></title-group></front-stub><body><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Essential revisions:</p><p>1) There is no data presented to confirm the knockdowns by either qRT-PCR or immunoblotting.

The initial screen was actually done with two independent individual siRNAs. We apologize that this was not clear in the initial submission. We have now clarified this in the text and show in main Figure 3B the combined average of these individual siRNAs, while in Figure 3—figure supplement 1B we show the data for each of the individual siRNA. We have also added in Figure 3—figure supplement 1A qPCR data demonstrating knock-down for a representative subset of the 61 genes tested, including all of those which we follow in the rest of the study. In our hands, the C911 controls typically have a partial KD impact on target genes, which would complicate any interpretation. Therefore, we have instead included as controls for our KDs a scrambled siRNA (“NS”, Figure 3—figure supplement 1A) which does not impact viral infection (Figure 3), and the siRNA against hnRNP K, which does impact viral infection (Figure 5A). Neither of these have any significant impact on the target genes tested in our screen. Finally, while the plaque assays are cumbersome such that it is not feasible to text all 61 genes, we have done this for a subset of our “hits” from the siRNA screen, showing that all 5 of those tested show a change in viral progeny that consistent with the screen. These data are now included in Figure 3—figure -supplement 1C.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>2) The parallel discussion of the siRNA and AMO data was confusing and more in-depth description of the results is needed.

We have now clarified the difference in the siRNA experiments (which target all isoforms) and the AMO experiments (which specifically block the viral-induced isoform). As such, these are very different experiments with different goals, which we are more careful now to explain in the text. We have also added data demonstrating the efficiency of knockdown (new Figure 3—figure supplement 1A), as described above. It is true that for some of the genes (i.e. IQCB1) we cannot directly link viral-induced splicing to function; however, it may be that the viral-induced isoform contributes to a stage of viral infection that we have not specifically assayed here.</p><p>For reasons we don’t understand, but likely has to do with sequence context, not all alternative exons are able to be blocked by AMOs. This is the case for the 6/11 genes that had induced exon inclusion but for which we were unable to force exon skipping – which we have now clarified in the text. To address the reviewers’ comments and add additional examples of functional impact of splicing on IAV infection, we have now also targeted the alternative 3’ splice site choice in ERI2 and show in new additional data in Figure 4 that this results in a dramatic loss of viral infection and replication.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>3) The authors assert that hnRNP K accumulates to higher levels in nuclear speckles during IAV infection by performing immunofluorescence (IFA) (Figure 6).

As suggested by the reviewers, we have now measured the volume of nuclear speckles, using SC35 as a marker, with and without infection. We feel these measurements are more precise and accurate than quantifying variance of fluorescence across the nuclei since observed changes at the nucleoplasm cannot be specifically attributed to changes in hnRNP K at nuclear speckles as hnRNP K is localized throughout the nucleus. Additionally, the small nature of nuclear speckles containing hnRNP K compared to hnRNP K present in the entire area of the nucleus may also fail to detect significant changes at nuclear speckles. Based on the SC35 staining, we have found that nuclear speckle volume on average does increases upon infection, at a level comparable to, but somewhat less, than the level of increase of hnRNP K in nuclear speckle upon infection. This suggests that the increase in speckle volume and hnRNP K recruitment to speckles are coordinated with each other. We have added this volume measurement to the figure in a new Figure 6E. We also acknowledge that the increased recruitment of hnRNP K to speckles that we observe upon infection is not large and may not be sufficient to fully account for the changes in splicing. As it is the only significant difference we observe in hnRNP K, we do feel it is important to report and could be driving changes in hnRNP K function, especially in combination with competition between host and viral transcripts; however, we have adjusted the text to be parsimonious in the description of the data and our conclusions.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>4) The link between hnRNPK and splicing changes that occur during IAV infection is supported mostly by correlational data (Figure 5); direct evidence that hnRNPK activity is responsible for the IAV-induced splicing changes is lacking.

In brief, upon KD of hnRNP K, we don’t see any further change in splicing of target genes tested (CLK1 CREB1, etc.) upon IAV infection. While these results are consistent with our model that hnRNP K drives these splicing changes during IAV infection, and we state such now in the text, we are cautious in our interpretation because viral infection is also attenuated upon hnRNP K KD, as shown in Figure 5A. Therefore, it is difficult to fully conclude that the lack of further change in splicing in these cells is only due to the direct role of hnRNP K on these targets and not to reduced infection. This same complication of reduced infection is also true of the ∆K-mut IAV, such that we have not looked at splicing of target genes in this condition since the expectation and interpretation are so unclear.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>5) The authors did not cite or discuss several papers that are pertinent to this study that have also profiled IAV-induced host gene expression changes at multiple levels (transcription, splicing, mRNA turnover, translation).

Our rationale for testing the impact of IFN was to address if the “viral-induced” changes were a secondary response to secreted IFN in bystander cells. We have now clarified the text regarding our rationale and conclusions from this experiment. We agree it will be interesting in future studies to address how much of the host response to viral infection is contributing to splicing changed in virus-containing cells. However, we view this as outside the scope of the current study.</p></body></sub-article></article>
