fundamental process, achieved in every cell by the ‘Sec’ translocon. In prokaryotes, SecYEG associates with the motor ATPase SecA to carry out translocation for pre-protein secretion. Previously, we proposed a Brownian ratchet model for transport, whereby the free energy of ATP-turnover favours the directional diffusion of the polypeptide (Allen et al., 2016). Here, we show that ATP enhances this process by modulating secondary structure formation within the translocating protein. A combination of molecular simulation with hydrogendeuterium-exchange mass spectrometry and electron paramagnetic resonance spectroscopy reveal an asymmetry across the membrane: ATP-induced conformational changes in the cytosolic cavity promote unfolded pre-protein structure, while the exterior cavity favours its formation. This ability to exploit structure within a pre-protein is an unexplored area of protein transport, which may apply to other protein transporters, such as those of the endoplasmic reticulum and mitochondria.</p></abstract><kwd-group kwd-group-type="author-keywords"><kwd>SecA</kwd><kwd>SecYEG</kwd><kwd>protein translocation</kwd><kwd>molecular dynamics</kwd><kwd>hydrogen deuterium exchange

has necessitated the evolution of machineries that conduct proteins across membranes, including for protein secretion and organellar import. Usually, protein transport occurs before the nascent protein has folded. This paper explores how the protein folding process per se may be exploited to drive protein translocation.</p><p>The bulk of protein secretion and membrane protein insertion is conducted by the ubiquitous Sec translocon. In bacteria, this comprises SecY, SecE and usually SecG, with the protein-conducting pore running through the centre of SecY. This complex can associate with either the ribosome for co-translational protein translocation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Blobel and Dobberstein, 1975</xref>) – the main pathway for nascent membrane protein insertion in bacteria (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib59">Müller et al., 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib46">Jungnickel et al., 1994</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib76">Ulbrandt et al., 1997</xref>) – or with the motor protein SecA for post-translational secretion of pre-proteins (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">Hartl et al., 1990</xref>), which contain an N-terminal cleavable signal sequence. In the latter case, the fully synthesised pre-protein is maintained in an unfolded conformation by chaperones, such as SecB, and SecA itself (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">Hartl et al., 1990</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Arkowitz et al., 1993</xref>). The protein must then fold during or after the translocation process.</p><p>Post-translational translocation of the unfolded pre-protein occurs through a contiguous channel formed through SecA and SecY (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1A–C</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib83">Zimmer et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib78">Van den Berg et al., 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib50">Li et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Bauer and Rapoport, 2009</xref>). The first step in this process is the ATP-dependent ‘initiation’ phase, whereby the pre-protein is targeted <italic>via</italic> its cleavable N-terminal signal sequence to SecA, and subsequently to the SecYEG complex (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Fessl et al., 2018</xref>). Transfer of the signal sequence to SecY unlocks the protein-channel, enabling the intercalation of the rest of the pre-protein (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Corey et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">Hizlan et al., 2012</xref>). Next, the pre-protein is fed through the SecY channel in a process driven by both ATP and the proton-motive-force (PMF) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Brundage et al., 1990</xref>), with each mechanism requiring specific interactions with cardiolipin (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Gold et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Corey et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">Hendrick and Wickner, 1991</xref>). Finally, the signal sequence is cleaved and the pre-protein is either folded or trafficked onwards.</p><fig-group><fig id="fig1" position="float"><label>Figure 1.</label><caption><title>Structures of SecYEG and SecA.</title><p>Interior views of (<bold>A</bold>) SecYEβ (PDB 1RHZ; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib78">Van den Berg et al., 2004</xref>) and (<bold>B</bold>) SecYEG-SecA (PDB 3DIN; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib83">Zimmer et al., 2008</xref>) showing the cavities through the channel, with the protein in grey surface, the pre-protein pore constrictions in red (SecY) or purple (SecA) mesh, and the SecY plug in red helix.

This pore ring is capped by the so-called ‘plug’ motif (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib78">Van den Berg et al., 2004</xref>), which sits on the external face of the pore (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1A</xref>; red helix), and helps to seal the channel against undesirable ion flux (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib61">Park and Rapoport, 2011</xref>). Upon SecA binding, SecY rearranges to form a more open state, involving the relocation of the plug (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib83">Zimmer et al., 2008</xref>), likely controlled by the ATPase activity of SecA (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Fessl et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Allen et al., 2016</xref>). This state still contains solvated cytoplasmic and exterior cavities, but with a profoundly changed shape of the channel (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1B</xref>).</p><p>Recently, additional information on the translocation process has come from a pseudo-translocation state captured in a crystal structure of <italic>Geobacillus thermodentrificans</italic> SecYE bound to <italic>Bacillus subtilis</italic> SecA (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib50">Li et al., 2016</xref>); remodelled for <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1C</xref>. This structure was determined by engineering a region of pre-protein into the SecA two helix finger (2HF), such that it resides within the SecY channel. Amongst many observations, the data reveal that the central pore of SecY tightly clasps the pre-protein (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1A</xref>).</p><p>Previously, we proposed a Brownian ratchet mechanism for ATP-driven protein secretion, where stochastic pre-protein diffusion is biased into directional force by the action of the SecA ATPase (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Allen et al., 2016</xref>). We demonstrated that ATPase activity was able to regulate the open (ATP) and closed (ADP) states of the SecY channel; thus allowing/preventing passage of specific regions of pre-protein, such as large or charged residues, or small helical regions of secondary structure. The SecA 2HF can sense these regions, and communicate their presence back to SecA to trigger nucleotide exchange, thereby providing the means to bias Brownian motion (see Figure 8 and Video 1 in <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Allen et al., 2016</xref>).</p><p>Here, we extend this model to include structural changes within the channel and translocating pre-protein. We employ atomistic molecular dynamics (MD) simulation on a remodelled version of the pseudo-translocation crystal structure, along with electron paramagnetic resonance (EPR) spectroscopy and hydrogen deuterium exchange mass spectrometry (HDX-MS) on <italic>E. coli</italic> SecA-SecYEG. Together, the data reveal structural changes between the cytoplasmic and exterior cavities of SecY during the SecA ATPase cycle. These changes are instigated by a widening of the cytoplasmic cavity in the ATP-bound state. In the simulation data, this widening results in a reduced degree of pre-protein secondary structure when compared to the exterior cavity. We show this asymmetry is strongly diminished in the ADP-bound state, suggesting pre-protein transport is, in part, driven by ATP-dependent control of secondary structure formation.</p></sec><sec id="s2" sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><sec id="s2-1"><title>Asymmetric secondary structure formation of translocon-engaged pre-protein</title><p>To investigate the structural changes in the pre-protein during the translocation process, we remodelled the pseudo-translocation state crystal structure (PDB 5EUL [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib50">Li et al., 2016</xref>]) into a physiological complex (i.e. a non-fusion protein) containing SecA, SecYE and 76 residues of unfolded pre-protein, hereafter referred to as ‘SecA-SecYE-PP’; see Materials and methods section for full modelling detail (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1B–C</xref> and <xref ref-type="table" rid="table1">Table 1</xref>).

To this end, we applied the EPR technique of double electron-electron resonance (DEER; otherwise known as PELDOR) spectroscopy, which allows detailed conformational sampling of the distances between two spin labels attached at specific positions to a molecule (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib57">Milov et al., 1981</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib55">Martin et al., 1998</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib43">Jeschke, 2012</xref>).</p><p>Firstly, we conducted MD simulations of the <italic>T. thermophilus</italic> SecYEG resting state structure (PDB 5AWW [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib72">Tanaka et al., 2015</xref>]) labelled with nitroxide-containing spin label ‘MTS’ (MTS; S-(1-oxyl-2,2,5,5-tetramethyl-2,5-dihydro-1H-pyrrol-3-yl)methyl methanethiosulfonate) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Berliner et al., 1982</xref>; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5s1">Figure 5—figure supplement 1A</xref>) covalently attached to two cysteines on either sides of the SecY channel: residues Ile-58 and Ser-101 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5s1">Figure 5—figure supplement 1B</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Fessl et al., 2018</xref>).

Comparing the two ensembles, we observe that transitioning to the open structure reduces the inter-label distance substantially (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5A–C</xref>). This is mainly caused by resizing of the central cavity, which permits one of the spin labels to flip inside (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5B</xref>).

This is consistent with a destabilisation of this region and may indicate a more ‘open’ cavity. In contrast, from the two peptides identified that line the exterior cavity (PC; not including the ‘plug’, see below), one of them revealed protection and the other a mild deprotection suggesting a more limited effect of ATP on the exterior cavity (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6B,D</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6s1">Figure 6—figure supplement 1C</xref>). This is consistent with the MD simulations which also showed mild dynamic changes in these regions.</p><p>Interestingly, detailed inspection of the equivalent regions in the MD simulation data reveals striking similarities with the HDX-MS results.

The ATP-dependent mobilisation of this area does indeed appear to increase the size of the cavity and therefore could influence the folded state of the adjacent translocating pre-protein. Together, these analyses provide compelling evidence for a nucleotide-driven asymmetric resizing of the SecY cavities.</p><p>Overall the data confirm the presence of long-range conformational changes from the nucleotide binding site on SecA to the protein-channel (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1C</xref>) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Fessl et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Allen et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib64">Robson et al., 2007</xref>). Many of these differences occur in regions of SecYEG known to be susceptible to remote nucleotide modulation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6s1">Figure 6—figure supplement 1D</xref>). For example, the increased HDX (ATP <italic>versus</italic> ADP) observed in the ‘plug’ (extended plug loop; EPL) of SecY and the amphipathic helix (AH) of SecE are consistent with their known mobilisation in the translocon when activated by ATP (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Corey et al., 2016</xref>). The contrasting decrease in HDX seen in the two largest cytosolic loops (CL) of SecY (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6s1">Figure 6—figure supplement 1D</xref>) reflects the tighter association with SecA in the ATP bound state (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib64">Robson et al., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib65">Robson et al., 2009</xref>).

The general assumption is that the tertiary structure forms after the translocation process, but what of the secondary structure? Does it form prior, during or after protein transport? This study seeks to investigate this problem and explore how the folding process <italic>per se</italic> might be exploited in the mechanism of protein transport.</p><p>A high degree of secondary structure has been reported for extended pre-proteins as they exit the ribosome (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib52">Lu and Deutsch, 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Hardesty and Kramer, 2001</xref>), and many proteins fold further once they emerge into the periplasm (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Antonoaea et al., 2008</xref>). Furthermore, previous studies have intimated that pre-protein can form secondary structure within the translocon (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">Gumbart et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib81">Zhang et al., 2017</xref>). Here, we have combined computational and structural experiments on the SecA-SecY complex, aimed at elucidating the importance of pre-protein folding for the process of protein translocation.</p><p>The data shown here reveal a propensity for the pre-protein to form secondary structure in both the cytoplasmic and exterior cavities of the channel, when associated with SecA bound to ADP. Strikingly, when ATP is bound to SecA, this propensity becomes highly asymmetric, with secondary structure strongly disfavoured in the cytoplasmic cavity (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2</xref>). In this state, the cavity also exhibits a marked change in environment and increased size (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figures 3B</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">4B</xref>), confirmed by EPR DEER spectroscopy (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5</xref>) and HDX MS (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6</xref>). This also causes a decrease in contact between the translocon and pre-protein (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4C</xref>). These observations suggest a specific role for ATP (and its hydrolysis to ADP) in regulating the structure of the translocating pre-protein: ATP binding causes the SecY cytoplasmic cavity to expand, reducing the amount of secondary structure, relative to the amount formed in the exterior cavity.</p><p>Steered MD simulations confirm that regions of secondary structure are much less likely to pass the narrow SecY pore (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7</xref>). Taken together, these effects could contribute significantly to any translocation model that incorporates pre-protein diffusion within the channel, including full diffusion-based models (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Allen et al., 2016</xref>) and hybrid diffusion/power stroke models (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Bauer et al., 2014</xref>). Interestingly, the data also argues against full power-stroke based models (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Erlandson et al., 2008a</xref>), as the pre-protein conformational changes observed here are apparently unrelated to motions of the 2HF.</p><p>The results described here allow us to extend our previously proposed ‘Brownian ratchet’ model for protein translocation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Allen et al., 2016</xref>), outlined in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8">Figure 8</xref>. The initiation process involves ATP dependent activation of SecYEG by SecA and the pre-protein signal sequence (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Fessl et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Corey et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">Hizlan et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Gold et al., 2013</xref>), and results in an intercalated diffusible mature region of pre-protein (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8">Figure 8</xref>). When the translocon is bound to ADP, unstructured polypeptide in this region can flow freely within the channel, which explains why ‘backsliding’ can occur in the ADP bound state (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Erlandson et al., 2008b</xref>). Meanwhile, secondary structure can equally form in the exterior or cytosolic cavities, producing no bias for forward or backward translocation. However, the appearance of secondary structure in the cytosolic cavity promotes nucleotide exchange, ADP for ATP (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Allen et al., 2016</xref>) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8">Figure 8</xref>, bottom left). As we show in this study, the ATP bound translocon strongly favours secondary structure formation in the exterior cavity, but not so in the cytosolic cavity. Given that the folded domains cannot backtrack, this favours the forward diffusion of polypeptide (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8">Figure 8</xref>, upper middle). Successive rounds of hydrolysis and exchange continue until transport is complete and the signal sequence is removed by proteolysis (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8">Figure 8</xref>, centre right). Since, during translocation the steady-state complex is dominated by the ATP-bound state (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib65">Robson et al., 2009</xref>) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8">Figure 8</xref>, green box), the observed asymmetry is maintained throughout (upper states predominate); thus preventing backsliding and favouring productive transport.</p><fig id="fig8" position="float"><label>Figure 8.</label><caption><title>Extended model for pre-protein translocation through SecA-SecYEG.</title><p>In this model, SecA is shown in light blue, SecYEG in light pink, the SecY central cavity in dark pink and the pre-protein in dark blue, as per <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1</xref>. Following initiation (centre left), localised pre-protein secondary structure formation can occur in either the exterior or cytoplasmic cavity, with roughly equal chance between compartments in the ADP state. Structure in the exterior cavity favours forward – productive – diffusion (top left state), because the structured region cannot diffuse backwards. Structure in the cytoplasmic cavity would favour backward – unproductive – diffusion (bottom left state). We previously demonstrated that bulky pre-protein in the cytoplasmic cavity triggers nucleotide exchange (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Allen et al., 2016</xref>). Here, we demonstrate that ATP induces a strong asymmetry across the channel: secondary structure is much more likely to form in the exterior cavity (upper middle state). Thus, in the ATP-bound state productive forwards diffusion is favoured over backwards. At this point, either translocation proceeds to completion, or ATP hydrolysis resets the complex for successive cycles of ATP hydrolysis and ADP exchange for ATP (right). In this way, ATP is acting to prevent the backward diffusion of pre-protein in the complex, by shifting the equilibrium away from the bottom (unproductive) states (yellow arrows).</p></caption><graphic mime-subtype="tiff" mimetype="image" xlink:href="elife-41803-fig8-v3.tif"/></fig><p>This new mechanism for forward transport through the channel, along with additional stimulation from the trans-membrane PMF (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Brundage et al., 1990</xref>), could achieve the required very fast rates required for efficient protein secretion.

Then, 10 independent steered MD simulations were run for each state, where the substrate was pulled from the C-terminal residue in a z-axis direction using a force constant of 600 kJ mol<sup>−1</sup> nm<sup>−1</sup>. For each repeat, the time take for the helical/non-helical region to cross the pore was measured, based on the centre-of-mass distance between the region and the SecY pore residues, Ile-78, Ile-183, Ile-275 and Ile-404 (<italic>G. thermodentrificans</italic> numbering).</p></sec></sec></body><back><ack id="ack"><title>Acknowledgements</title><p>This work was funded by the BBSRC: BB/M003604/1, BB/I008675/1 and BB/N015126/1 to RAC, WJA and IC, and Wellcome: 104632 to IC and WJA and 109854/Z/15/Z to AP and ZA.

The formation of secondary structure is linked to lowered rates of backtracking in the translocon. This suggests a molecular mechanism for how ATP hydrolysis in SecA can drive directional transport of a nascent protein through. This work may represent an important conceptual advance in our understanding of the mechanism of protein translocation by SecA-SecYEG.</p><p>Essential revisions:</p><p>The reviewers suggested acceptance of this manuscript with the following revisions:</p><p>1) The authors plausibly suggest that it is more difficult for folded structures – even α-helices – than unfolded structures to pass through SecYEG. It is not made sufficiently clear, however, whether the conformational changes in the SecA-SecYEG complex from ATP hydrolysis promote folding of the pre-protein on the exterior face of SecYEG, or unfolding of the pre-protein in the interior cavity of SecYEG, or both.</p><p>2) The section describing the solvent (dis)order (Figure 3) is somewhat confusing. Is the chemical or physical basis for the increase in disorder known? Because the authors specifically mention this effect, and because the effect is so pronounced, it should be discussed in the Discussion as to how it affects folding of the pre-protein.</p><p>3) The final (diagrammatic) main figure seems unnecessarily complicated and overly reliant on the legend. (Does it really need 11 cartoon states connected with arrows?) Simplifying this figure is important to better conveying the key conclusions to the readers.</p><p>4) Although this is not a precondition for the acceptance, the reviewers think the manuscript may benefit from additional simulations in which the nascent chain is pulled from the exterior side of the channel with SecYEG in the two different conformations induced by SecA (ATP-bound and ADP-bound).</p></body></sub-article><sub-article article-type="reply" id="sa2"><front-stub><article-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.41803.sa2</article-id><title-group><article-title>Author response</article-title></title-group></front-stub><body><p>[Editors’ note: the author responses to the first round of peer review follow.]</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>The authors observed different channel shape of SecA bound with ATP vs. ADP from MD simulations and suggested that this should translate into different helix formation of the translocating polypeptide, which may help driven the translocation process and maintain its forward direction.

So, we have been able to add an extensive amount of simulation data to address this point. Firstly, we have carried out μs simulations using a coarse-grained molecular force field of the protein complexes in a mixed bilayer, with PE, PG and cardiolipin present (Figure 2—figure supplement 4C-D). This permitted not only analysis of the effects of acidic lipids in the membrane, but also the effect of specific Sec-acidic lipid interactions (as we discussed in Corey et al., 2018).</p><p>We then carried out a new tranche of folding simulation data using these systems, to assay the effect of acidic lipids on the observed pre-protein folding asymmetry. In total this amounts to 2 μs of additional atomistic simulation – achievable thanks to a generous provision of resources from EPCC’s cirrus.</p><p>The new folding data (Figure 2—figure supplement 4E) reveals that the previously observed pre-protein asymmetry in secondary structure is not dependent of specific or general interactions with acidic lipids.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Reviewer #1:</p><p>The authors previously proposed a probabilistic model for SecA-mediated protein translocation that relies on ATP-regulated gating of the SecYEG channel.

To ensure that this was done as fully as possible, we built on analyses we recently published in PNAS (Corey et al., 2018), using coarse-grained simulation to identify multiple Sec-lipid interactions (Figure 2—figure supplement 4C-D). We then analysed the systems as per the rest of the data, incorporating it into the main analysis (Figure 2C) as well as providing a comparative analysis (Figure 2—figure supplement 4E).</p><p>In addition, we have invested considerable effort, hence the long delay, to satisfy the additional concerns of the reviewers; even though their resolution was not a strict condition for the resubmission. We have added two sets of empirical observations on the <italic>E. coli</italic> SecA-SecYEG complex. The new experiments probe the nature of the asymmetrical cavities in the ATP state with combined EPR DEER spectroscopy and additional MD simulations (Figure 5 and supplemental panels), as well as state-of-the art HDX/MS (Figure 6 and supplemental panels). We believe the results add valuable support to the suppositions based on our calculations.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Reviewer #2:</p><p>Beginning with an x-ray structure of an engineered version of SecA bound to SecYEG, the authors have carried out an extensive set of microsecond-scale simulations of SecA-SecYEG with SecA in an ATP- or ADP-bound state.

We chose to use a standard POPC membrane model as it was not clear exactly what the role of these lipids may be. However, since then we have reported on the nature of Sec-lipid interaction (Corey et al.,2018) so can now address this issue.</p><p>We have addressed this point and included the negative phospholipids (PG and CDL) in the simulations (see response to reviewer 1).</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>2) Time scale problems.

We highlight the less-stable region, which has to be extensively remodeled from the crystal structure. This is an unfortunate consequence of the modelling process, but – owing to the high quality of data for SecY and the SecA 2HF, and the distance of this region from the center of the channel – the chance of it producing artefacts is very low. This is especially the case as one of the key observations, the asymmetric cavity sizes, is visible in multiple simulations from different starting coordinates, as well with additional experimental data.</p><p>With respect to the timescale, the reviewer is correct in that we are sampling far shorter time scales than physiological translocation rates. That said, we are able to sample a very kinetically fast event – the asymmetric formation of pre-protein structure – which could undoubtedly have a profound effect on the pre-protein in the ms timescale. We have added a short passage in the Discussion to address this concern.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>3) Vague description of the building and testing of the initial structural model.

The only substantial changes appear to be in the SecA loop, which are most likely a result of the modelling process and likely do not affect the data here. Therefore, we do not include a comparison of the SecA models.</p><p>However, we have added initial MD data providing structural conformations of two different structures of SecYEG: 5AWW and 3DIN.
