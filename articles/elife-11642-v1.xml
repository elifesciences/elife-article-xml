For example, stressful conditions in the womb have been linked to adult depression and metabolic disorders. These effects are thought to be the result of changes in the way that genes in specific tissues are regulated in the individuals that have experienced the stress. However, it is not clear how a particular stress can cause long-term changes in gene activity in specific tissues.</p><p>A microscopic worm called <italic>Caenorhabditis elegans</italic> is often used as a simple animal model to study how animals develop and behave. Previous studies have shown that adult worms that experienced stress early in life show differences in behavior and gene activity compared to genetically identical worms that did not experience the stress. Here, Sims, Ow et al. asked what signals are required for these changes to happen.</p><p>The experiments show that a gene called <italic>osm-9</italic> – which plays a role in the nervous system – is less active in sensory nerve cells in worms that experienced stress early on in life. This loss of activity resulted in the worms being unable to respond to a particular odor. Two proteins called DAF-3 and ZFP-1 are able to bind to a section of DNA in the <italic>osm-9</italic> gene to decrease its activity in response to stress. These proteins are similar to human proteins that are important for development and are associated with some types of leukemia. Further experiments show that small molecules of ribonucleic acid in the “RNA interference” pathway also help to decrease the activity of <italic>osm-9</italic> after stress.</p><p>Together, Sims, Ow et al.’s findings suggest that environmental conditions in early life regulate the <italic>osm-9</italic> gene through the coordinated effort of DAF-3, ZFP-1 and the RNA interference pathway. The next steps are to investigate how these molecules are able to target <italic>osm-9</italic> and to identify other proteins that regulate gene activity in response to stress in early life.</p><p><bold>DOI:</bold> <ext-link ext-link-type="doi" xlink:href="10.7554/eLife.11642.002">http://dx.doi.org/10.7554/eLife.11642.002</ext-link></p></abstract><kwd-group kwd-group-type="author-keywords"><title>Author Keywords</title><kwd>postdauer</kwd><kwd>dauer</kwd><kwd>TGF-beta</kwd><kwd>RNAi</kwd><kwd>chromatin</kwd><kwd>osm-9</kwd></kwd-group><kwd-group kwd-group-type="research-organism"><title>Research Organism</title><kwd><italic>C. elegans</italic></kwd></kwd-group><funding-group><award-group id="par-1"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000002</institution-id><institution>National Institutes of Health</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>NIGMS 5-F32-GM83593</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Hall</surname><given-names>Sarah E</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="par-2"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000001</institution-id><institution>National Science Foundation</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>IOS 0842452</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Sengupta</surname><given-names>Piali</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="par-3"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100003725</institution-id><institution>National Research Foundation of Korea</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>2012R1A1A2009385</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Kim</surname><given-names>Kyuhyung</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="par-4"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution>DGIST R&amp;D Program of the Ministry of Science, ICT and Future Planning</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>15-BD-06</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Kim</surname><given-names>Kyuhyung</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="par-5"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000048</institution-id><institution>American Cancer Society</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>1092124-56171:IRG1105201</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Hall</surname><given-names>Sarah E</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="par-6"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100007126</institution-id><institution>Syracuse University</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>Reneé Crown University Honors Program Lynn Parker Award</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Nishiguchi</surname><given-names>Mailyn A</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><funding-statement>The funders had no role in study design, data collection and interpretation, or the decision to submit the work for publication.</funding-statement></funding-group><custom-meta-group><custom-meta><meta-name>elife-xml-version</meta-name><meta-value>2.5</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta specific-use="meta-only"><meta-name>Author impact statement</meta-name><meta-value>The OSM-9 TRPV channel is differentially regulated due to developmental programming via modulation by TGF-β signaling, endogenous RNAi and chromatin remodeling pathways.</meta-value></custom-meta></custom-meta-group></article-meta></front><body><sec id="s1" sec-type="intro"><title>Introduction</title><p>Increasing evidence suggests that exposure to stressful environmental conditions during a critical period in the early development of an organism can result in altered gene expression patterns that are maintained into adulthood. In mammals, this 'cellular memory' of early life stress has been shown to correlate with behavioral phenotypes that persist into adulthood (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib93">Weaver et al., 2004b</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib49">McGowan et al., 2009</xref>). For example, transcription levels of the <italic>glucocorticoid receptor</italic> (GR) gene in the mouse hippocampus are programmed by the maternal care behaviors of the mother towards her pups during the first postnatal week (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Fish et al., 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib94">Weaver et al., 2004a</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib92">2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib81">Szyf, 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib80">2008</xref>). High maternal care behaviors (such as frequent licking and grooming) lead to high GR expression and low stress responses in the pups as adults, whereas low maternal care results in increased DNA methylation, transcriptional silencing of the GR gene, and high stress responses. Intriguingly, this mechanism of gene regulation appears to be conserved in humans, as childhood adversity correlates with increased transcriptional silencing of the GR gene and mental disorders in adults (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib50">McGowan et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib49">2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib41">Labonté et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib40">Labonte et al., 2012</xref>). However, the molecular mechanisms establishing and maintaining the tissue-specific changes in gene expression in neurons due to environmental inputs during early development remain to be elucidated.</p><p>We have shown that environmental stress early in development can also modulate gene expression and behavior in <italic>Caenorhabditis elegans,</italic> thereby establishing nematodes as a model system for investigating the mechanisms underlying developmental programming of gene expression (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Hall et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">2013</xref>). The <italic>C. elegans</italic> life cycle is regulated by environmental cues during a critical period in the first larval stage. If conditions are favorable (low temperature, high food availability, low pheromone concentrations), worms continue to develop through four larval stages to become reproductive adults (control adults, CON). However, if conditions are unfavorable, worms enter the alternative stress-induced dauer diapause stage (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Golden and Riddle, 1982</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">1984</xref>). The <underline>da</underline>uer <underline>f</underline>ormation (<italic>daf</italic>) decision is regulated by the differential expression of conserved insulin and TGF-β pathways in sensory neurons in response to environmental conditions (reviewed in <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Fielenbach and Antebi, 2008</xref>). Once conditions improve, dauer animals re-enter the reproductive cycle and continue development to become reproductive adults (postdauer adults, PD). We have shown previously that CON and PD adults retain a cellular memory of their developmental history through changes in gene expression, genome-wide chromatin state, and life history traits (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Hall et al., 2010</xref>). In addition, these altered adult phenotypes are in part dependent on endogenous small interfering RNA pathways (endo-siRNAs) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Hall et al., 2013</xref>).</p><p>In recent years, our knowledge of <italic>C. elegans</italic> endo-siRNA pathways and their gene targets has increased substantially. Endo-siRNAs are ~20 to 30 nt in length, antisense to coding transcripts, and are categorized into two major groups based on their biogenesis pathways (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Gent et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib86">Vasale et al., 2010</xref>). Primary endo-siRNAs are 26 nt long, have a characteristic 5’ monophosphate, and are derived from Dicer processing of double-stranded RNA template (26G-siRNAs) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib86">Vasale et al., 2010</xref>). In somatic tissue, biogenesis of ERGO-1 class 26G-siRNAs is dependent upon the <italic><underline>e</underline>nhanced <underline>R</underline>NA<underline>i</underline></italic> (ERI) complex, which consists of the core proteins RNA-dependent RNA polymerase (RdRP) RRF-3, Dicer-related helicase DRH-3, and Tudor domain-containing protein ERI-5 that associate with Dicer DCR-1 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Duchaine et al., 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib64">Pavelec et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Gent et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib83">Thivierge et al., 2012</xref>). Through an unknown mechanism, 26G-siRNAs stimulate the production of secondary endo-siRNAs, which are 22 nt in length, have a 5’ triphosphate, and are produced through reverse transcription of mRNA templates by RdRPs (22G-siRNAs) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib78">Smardon et al., 2000</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib76">Simmer et al., 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib45">Maine et al., 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib87">Vought et al., 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Aoki et al., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib59">Pak et al., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib73">She et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib86">Vasale et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib60">Pak et al., 2012</xref>). Downstream effector functions of 22G-siRNAs, such as mRNA degradation or chromatin remodeling, are mediated by their associated <italic><underline>w</underline>orm-specific <underline>A</underline>r<underline>go</underline>naute</italic> protein (WAGO) in the cytoplasm or nucleus (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib96">Yigit et al., 2006</xref>). Additionally, <italic>Mutator</italic> proteins have been shown to be essential for the biogenesis and siRNA amplification of AGO ERGO-1 class 26G- and WAGO class 22G-siRNAs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib98">Zhang et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib67">Phillips et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib66">2014</xref>). Although components of the <italic>Mutator</italic> complex are expressed throughout the worm, their functions and cellular localization are specific to the germline or soma (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib67">Phillips et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib66">2014</xref>). Despite our understanding of endo-siRNA biogenesis, how siRNAs target and regulate endogenous genes, particularly in response to environmental cues, is poorly understood.</p><p>In this study, we show that expression of the OSM-9 TRPV channel is differentially regulated based on the developmental trajectory of <italic>C. elegans</italic> and describe the molecular mechanisms that regulate expression of this gene as a function of the animal’s developmental history. The <italic>osm-9</italic> gene is down-regulated specifically in the ADL chemosensory neurons of PD adults, resulting in a corresponding altered olfactory behavior that is mediated by ADL in an OSM-9-dependent manner. We identify a <italic>cis</italic>-acting motif bound by the DAF-3 SMAD and ZFP-1 (AF10) proteins that is necessary for the down-regulation of <italic>osm-9</italic> in PD adults and demonstrate that both chromatin remodeling and endo-siRNA pathways are major contributors to <italic>osm-9</italic> regulation. Our results suggest a mechanism of <italic>osm-9</italic> regulation whereby the dauer developmental decision, triggered by environmental stress, results in transcriptional silencing of the <italic>osm-9</italic> locus mediated by the TGF-β, chromatin remodeling, and endogenous RNAi pathways. This work describes an elegant mechanism of how tissue-specific changes in gene expression triggered by transient environmental cues can be maintained via developmental programming.</p></sec><sec id="s2" sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><sec id="s2-1"><title>Expression of the <italic>osm-9</italic> TRPV gene is regulated by developmental history</title><p>Gene expression analyses identified the <italic>osm-9</italic> TRPV channel gene as a candidate gene whose expression is regulated as a consequence of passage through the dauer stage (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Hall et al., 2010</xref>). <italic>osm-9</italic> is expressed in a subset of head and tail neurons and is required for chemosensory, osmosensory, and mechanosensory behaviors in adult animals (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Colbert et al., 1997</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">de Bono et al., 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">Jansen et al., 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib85">Tobin et al., 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib95">White et al., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib57">O'Halloran et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib70">Sassa et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib89">Wang et al., 2015a</xref>).

We used a transgenic strain expressing GFP in ADL neurons under a promoter whose expression is unaffected upon dauer passage (<italic>sre-1</italic>p::<italic>gfp</italic>) to identify the correct neuron and to quantify the <italic>gfp</italic> mRNA molecules present as a control (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s3">Figure 1—figure supplement 3</xref>). For both the <italic>osm-9</italic> and <italic>gfp</italic> smFISH probes, we observed that the fluorescent foci within ADL exhibited unequal sizes and intensities; thus, we were not confident that we could resolve the number of individual mRNA molecules simply by counting the number of smFISH loci. Instead, we quantified the fluorescence intensities of ADL neurons as a measure of the <italic>osm-9</italic> and <italic>gfp</italic> mRNA molecules present. We found that ADL neurons in CON adults exhibited significantly greater mean and maximum fluorescence intensities for the <italic>osm-9</italic> mRNA probes compared to PD adults (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1C</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s2">Figure 1—figure supplement 2</xref>). In contrast, fluorescence intensities for the <italic>gfp</italic> mRNA probes exhibited overall similar mean and maximum fluorescence levels for PD compared to CON adults (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s3">Figure 1—figure supplement 3</xref>). We conclude that the differential regulation of the <italic>osm-9</italic>p::<italic>gfp</italic> transgene is reflective of the regulation of the endogenous <italic>osm-9</italic> gene.</p><p>Next, we asked whether passage through the dauer stage was necessary for the observed changes in gene expression, or if exposure to high concentrations of pheromone without dauer entry was sufficient as has been reported for the regulation of chemoreceptor genes in a subset of neurons in <italic>C. elegans</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib65">Peckol et al., 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib56">Nolan et al., 2002</xref>). To address this question, we allowed wild-type embryos to hatch on plates containing crude pheromone as previously described (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib55">Neal et al., 2013</xref>). Animals that bypassed dauer entry and animals that entered the dauer stage were recovered separately and examined for <italic>osm-9</italic>p::<italic>gfp</italic> expression in adults. We found that animals that bypassed dauer entry when exposed to high concentrations of dauer pheromone continued to express GFP in ADL neurons, similar to CON animals in our egg plate preparation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1B</xref>). However, animals that passed through the dauer stage exhibited the expected decrease in <italic>osm-9</italic>p::<italic>gfp</italic> expression in ADL (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1B</xref>). Similarly, animals that were transiently starved in early development continued to express GFP in ADL if they bypassed the dauer stage, but exhibited decreased GFP expression following passage through dauer (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1B</xref>). These results indicate that the down-regulation of <italic>osm-9</italic>p::<italic>gfp</italic> in adults is dependent on passage through the dauer stage regardless of the environmental trigger inducing dauer entry.</p></sec><sec id="s2-2"><title>ADL-mediated behavior is altered as a consequence of passage through the dauer stage</title><p>To examine the phenotypic consequences of the differential regulation of <italic>osm-9</italic>, we tested whether an ADL-mediated and OSM-9 dependent behavior is affected upon passage through the dauer stage. Wild-type hermaphrodites avoid high concentrations of the dauer pheromone component ascr#3; this avoidance behavior requires the OSM-9 and OCR-2 TRPV channels in the ADL neurons (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Jang et al., 2012</xref>). We hypothesized that if the endogenous <italic>osm-9</italic> gene were down-regulated in ADL neurons of PD animals, these animals would fail to avoid ascr#3 similar to <italic>osm-9</italic> mutants. To test this hypothesis, we examined the ability of wild-type and <italic>osm-9</italic> mutant CON and PD adults to avoid 100 nM ascr#3 using drop-test assays (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">Hilliard et al., 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Jang et al., 2012</xref>). We observed that wild-type PD adults exhibited a significantly reduced avoidance response to ascr#3 compared to CON adults (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1D</xref>). However, these animals retained the ability to avoid glycerol, an OSM-9-dependent behavior mediated by the ASH neurons, and were attracted to the odorant diacetyl, an OSM-9-dependent behavior mediated by the AWA neurons (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1B</xref>; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s1">Figure 3—figure supplement 1C</xref>) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib72">Sengupta et al., 1996</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Colbert et al., 1997</xref>). These observations are consistent with the observed down-regulation of <italic>osm-9</italic> expression in the ADL neurons.</p><p>To verify that the decreased ascr#3 avoidance phenotype in wild-type PD adults was due to decreased expression of <italic>osm-9</italic> in ADL neurons, we restored <italic>osm-9</italic> expression specifically in ADL neurons of <italic>osm-9</italic> mutants by driving the cDNA under <italic>sre-1</italic> upstream regulatory sequences. Since <italic>sre-1</italic> expression is not detectably altered upon passage through the dauer stage (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s2">Figure 1—figure supplement 2A</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s3">Figure 1—figure supplement 3</xref>), we predicted that both CON and PD adults expressing <italic>sre-1</italic>p::<italic>osm-9 cDNA::gfp</italic> transgene would continue to avoid ascr#3. However, while the transgene rescued the <italic>osm-9</italic> mutant phenotype in CON animals indicating that the fusion protein is functional, avoidance behavior was again decreased in PD animals (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1D</xref>). We also attempted to rescue the decrease in ascr#3 avoidance in wild-type PD adults by expressing the same <italic>sre-1</italic>p::<italic>osm-9 cDNA::gfp</italic> transgene in ADL neurons. Again, we observed ascr#3 avoidance behavior similar to wild-type animals without the transgene (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1D</xref>). Although our results thus far have indicated that <italic>osm-9</italic> is regulated at the transcriptional level in response to developmental history, these results suggest that silencing mechanisms might also target the <italic>osm-9</italic> coding sequences or mRNA, or alternatively, additional genes contributing to the ascr#3 behavior.</p></sec><sec id="s2-3"><title><italic>osm-9</italic> down-regulation requires a <italic>cis</italic>-acting promoter motif</title><p>Since transcriptional down-regulation contributes to the decreased <italic>osm-9</italic>p::<italic>gfp</italic> expression in ADL in PD animals, we analyzed <italic>osm-9</italic> upstream regulatory sequences present in the <italic>osm-9</italic>p::<italic>gfp</italic> transgene to identify regulatory motifs contributing to the altered expression. Using bioinformatics-based analyses of <italic>osm-9</italic> upstream regulatory sequences, we identified a 29 bp motif (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2A</xref>) that is present in the upstream regulatory sequences of 977 (4.9%) genes in the genome. This conserved sequence was slightly enriched (121 genes, 5.6%; Z-test, p=0.056) in the regulatory regions of genes that were differentially expressed between CON and PD adults (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Hall et al., 2010</xref>). We also identified an additional motif, a predicted DAF-3 SMAD binding site, located 22 bp upstream of the conserved sequence (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2A</xref>) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib82">Thatcher et al., 1999</xref>). We will henceforth refer to this combined regulatory sequence as the PD motif. To test the functional relevance of this motif, we generated a series of <italic>osm-9</italic>p::<italic>gfp</italic> transcriptional fusion constructs lacking portions of the <italic>osm-9</italic> regulatory sequences and examined their expression in ADL neurons of CON and PD adults (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2A,C</xref>). Deletion of the PD motif in the context of the 375 bp <italic>osm-9</italic> regulatory sequences (Deletion 1) resulted in continued expression of <italic>gfp</italic> in ADL in PD adults without affecting expression in CON animals, indicating that this <italic>cis</italic>-regulatory motif is required for the down-regulation of <italic>osm-9</italic> in PD ADL neurons (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2A,C</xref>). Deletion of sequences that did not include the PD motif (Deletion 2) resulted in <italic>gfp</italic> expression changes in PD ADL neurons similar to that observed with the full length <italic>osm-9</italic>p::<italic>gfp</italic> transgene (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2A,C</xref>). Deletion 3, which contained the 18 bp of <italic>osm-9</italic> coding sequence in addition to the 375 bp of upstream regulatory sequence, also exhibited down-regulation of <italic>gfp</italic> expression in ADL neurons of PD adults (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2A,C</xref>). These results indicate that the <italic>cis</italic>-acting PD motif is necessary for the transcriptional regulation of <italic>osm-9</italic> due to developmental programming.</p><p>To further characterize the PD motif sequence necessary for differential regulation of <italic>osm-9</italic>, we sequentially replaced a subset of bases within the PD motif with guanines and examined <italic>gfp</italic> expression in ADL neurons of CON and PD adults (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2B,C</xref>). Mutated constructs 3 and 5 exhibited significantly increased GFP in ADL neurons of PD adults compared to wild-type (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2B,C</xref>), indicating that these sequences were required for complete down-regulation of <italic>osm-9</italic> in PD adults. However, we found that mutated constructs 1, 2, 4, 6, and 7 resulted in a significant decrease in <italic>osm-9</italic>p::<italic>gfp</italic> expression in both CON and PD ADL neurons (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2B,C</xref>), indicating that these sequences were required for the positive regulation of <italic>osm-9</italic> expression. Together these results suggest a model that, in the absence of the PD motif, the default state of <italic>osm-9</italic> expression in ADL neurons is transcriptional activation, and that the PD motif contains sequences necessary for the negative regulation of <italic>osm-9</italic> in response to developmental history.</p></sec><sec id="s2-4"><title>The TGF-β pathway negatively regulates <italic>osm-9</italic> in postdauer animals</title><p>To further illuminate the mechanisms regulating <italic>osm-9</italic> and ascr#3 avoidance behavior, we sought to identify factors that interact with the upstream regulatory sequences of <italic>osm-9</italic>. In addition to the potential DAF-3 SMAD binding site, further scrutiny of the <italic>osm-9 cis</italic>-regulatory sequences yielded potential binding sites for the DAF-12 nuclear hormone receptor (NHR), which functions downstream of TGF-β and insulin signaling pathways in the regulation of dauer formation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2A</xref>). To investigate a potential role of the TGF-β and insulin/IGF dauer formation pathways in the regulation of <italic>osm-9</italic>, we examined <italic>osm-9</italic>p::<italic>gfp</italic> expression in CON and PD adults of strains carrying mutations in genes implicated in dauer formation. First, we found that mutations in <italic>daf-3</italic> SMAD and <italic>daf-5</italic> SNO/SKI significantly increased the <italic>gfp</italic> expression observed in PD ADL neurons compared to wild-type animals (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3A</xref>). DAF-3 binds to DAF-5 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">da Graca et al., 2004</xref>), and may act together as negative regulators at the <italic>osm-9</italic> locus. In contrast, the <italic>daf-7</italic> TGF-β mutant strain exhibits a partial but significant decrease in <italic>osm-9</italic>p::<italic>gfp</italic> expression in ADL neurons of both CON and PD animals compared to wild-type, but expression in PD animals is again down-regulated as compared to CON animals (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3A</xref>). This result suggests that dauer formation, and not reduced TGF-β signaling alone, is required for the down-regulation of <italic>osm-9</italic> in PD ADL neurons. In addition, since DAF-7 TGF-β signaling antagonizes DAF-3/DAF-5 function, this result is also consistent with increased DAF-3/DAF-5 activity in a <italic>daf-7</italic> mutant promoting down-regulation of <italic>osm-9</italic> expression (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib88">Vowels and Thomas, 1992</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib84">Thomas et al., 1993</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib63">Patterson et al., 1997</xref>).

To test whether DAF-3 does indeed bind to the <italic>osm-9</italic> PD motif, we performed protein immunoprecipitation of DAF-3 from whole animals using a commercially available antibody (Novus Biologicals, Littleton, CO), followed by quantitative PCR (IP-qPCR) in CON and PD adult, dauer, and larval L2/L3 animals. Our results showed that DAF-3 was enriched at the potential DAF-3 binding site (DBS) in the <italic>osm-9</italic> promoter in PD adults compared to other tested stages (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3B</xref>). We also examined DAF-3 enrichment at the <italic>daf-8</italic> and <italic>daf-14</italic> promoters as positive and negative controls, respectively, since their regulation by DAF-3 has been characterized previously (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib62">Park et al., 2010</xref>). Although these results do not address DAF-3 enrichment at the PD motif specifically in ADL neurons, nor the precise binding site of DAF-3 (see <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s1">Figure 3—figure supplement 1</xref>), they are consistent with our model that DAF-3 negatively regulates <italic>osm-9</italic> in PD ADL neurons through a direct interaction at the PD motif.</p><p>We next characterized the role of the TGF-β pathway in modulating ascr#3 avoidance behavior by testing the ascr#3 avoidance responses of CON and PD animals in strains carrying mutations in <italic>daf-3</italic> SMAD, <italic>daf-7</italic> TGF-β, and <italic>daf-5</italic> SNO/SKI genes. Based on their role in the regulation of <italic>osm-9</italic> transcription (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3A</xref>), we expected to observe an elimination of the difference between the PD and CON ascr#3 avoidance behavior in <italic>daf-3</italic> and <italic>daf-5</italic> mutant strains and a reduced effect in <italic>daf-7</italic>. Indeed, we observed that mutations in <italic>daf-3</italic> SMAD and <italic>daf-5</italic> SNO/SKI genes eliminated the difference between CON and PD avoidance response to ascr#3, consistent with DAF-3 and DAF-5 acting as negative regulators of ascr#3 avoidance in PD animals (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3C</xref>). In addition, a mutation in the <italic>daf-7</italic> TGF-β gene significantly disrupted the PD/CON ascr#3 avoidance levels compared to wild-type, through a decrease in CON adult ascr#3 avoidance (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3C</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s2">Figure 3—figure supplement 2A</xref>). While most components of the TGF-β pathway exhibit broad expression patterns, DAF-7 TGF-β is expressed in ASI, ADE, and OLQ neurons, suggesting that a molecular signal from one of these sensory neurons may regulate <italic>osm-9</italic> expression in ADL (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib69">Ren et al., 1996</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib71">Schackwitz et al., 1996</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib51">Meisel et al., 2014</xref>).</p><p>Since TGF-β and insulin signaling pathways act in parallel to regulate dauer formation, we examined whether members of the insulin signaling pathway also contribute to the developmental programming of <italic>osm-9.</italic> We examined <italic>osm-9</italic>p::<italic>gfp</italic> expression in animals carrying mutations in the <italic>daf-2</italic> insulin/IGF receptor homolog, <italic>age-1</italic> PI3K homolog, <italic>pdk-1</italic> 3-phosphoinositide-dependent kinase 1 ortholog, and <italic>daf-16</italic> forkhead FOXO transcription factor (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Friedman and Johnson, 1988</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib88">Vowels and Thomas, 1992</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">Kenyon et al., 1993</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Gottlieb and Ruvkun, 1994</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib54">Morris et al., 1996</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib61">Paradis et al., 1999</xref>).

However, whether <italic>Mutator</italic> proteins form a complex in somatic tissue and their functions in neurons remain unclear.

Indeed, we found that mutations in genes associated with the <italic>Mutator</italic> complex, <italic>mut-15</italic> and <italic>mut-16</italic>, eliminated the difference in ascr#3 avoidance between CON and PD adults (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4C</xref>). The behavioral responses of <italic>mut-2, mut-14</italic> and <italic>rrf-1</italic> mutant strains also showed a trend towards disruption in the PD/CON ratio of ascr#3 avoidance (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4C</xref>). These results indicate that a subset of the <italic>Mutator</italic> proteins contributes to the plasticity of ascr#3 avoidance behavior.</p><p>Since dsRNAs are actively transported between cells and tissue types in <italic>C. elegans</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Feinberg and Hunter, 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">Jose et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib74">Shih and Hunter, 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib47">McEwan et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Devanapally et al., 2015</xref>), we asked whether the <italic>Mutators</italic> act cell-autonomously to regulate ascr#3 avoidance. To address this question, we expressed the <italic>mut-16</italic> cDNA under an ADL (<italic>srh-220</italic>p) or ASI (<italic>gpa-4</italic>p) specific promoter in the <italic>mut-16(mg461)</italic> strain and examined their ascr#3 avoidance phenotypes (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4C</xref>). We chose to examine MUT-16 function in ASI neurons as well, since <italic>daf-7</italic> and other TFG-β pathway genes are expressed in ASI (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib69">Ren et al., 1996</xref>). We observed that cell-specific rescue of MUT-16 in ADL partially rescued the ascr#3 avoidance in CON and PD animals (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4C</xref>). In contrast, MUT-16 expression in ASI failed to rescue the avoidance behavior (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4C</xref>). This result suggests that MUT-16 functions in ADL neurons to mediate ascr#3 avoidance behavior due to developmental history.</p><p>Both the ERGO-1 and NRDE-3 endo-siRNA pathways require components of the <italic>Mutator</italic> focus and the ERI complex for the biogenesis of their associated siRNAs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Duchaine et al., 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib64">Pavelec et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Gent et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib98">Zhang et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib67">Phillips et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib83">Thivierge et al., 2012</xref>). ERGO-1 AGO associates with 26G-siRNAs to target mRNA transcripts in the cytoplasm and acts upstream of the 22G-siRNA-mediated NRDE nuclear RNAi silencing complex, which has been shown to promote heterochromatin formation at targeted gene loci in somatic tissue (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Guang et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Gent et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Guang et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib86">Vasale et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Burkhart et al., 2011a</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Burkhart et al., 2011b</xref>).

Moreover, the ERI complex also plays a role in the down-regulation of <italic>osm-9</italic> in PD ADL neurons (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s1">Figure 4—figure supplement 1</xref>). These results indicate that the <italic>Mutator</italic> proteins, along with the endo-siRNA ERGO-1/NRDE pathway are playing a role in the developmental programming of <italic>osm-9</italic>. Consistent with a role for the ERGO-1 and NRDE pathways in the regulation of <italic>osm-9</italic> expression in PD adults, we found that mutations in <italic>ergo-1</italic> and <italic>nrde-3</italic> also resulted in the elimination of ascr#3 avoidance differences between CON and PD adults (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4C</xref>). Although we have not shown that <italic>osm-9</italic> is a direct target of endo-siRNA pathways, these results indicate that the <italic>Mutator</italic> proteins and ERGO-1/NRDE nuclear silencing pathways play a critical role in the developmental programming of <italic>osm-9</italic> and mediating the ascr#3 avoidance behavior due to developmental history.</p></sec><sec id="s2-6"><title>Chromatin remodeling pathways are required for maintenance of <italic>osm-9</italic> down-regulation in ADL neurons</title><p>Thus far, our results have suggested a model where <italic>osm-9</italic> is regulated via transcriptional gene silencing, which would promote alteration of the chromatin state at the <italic>osm-9</italic> locus. To ask whether functional chromatin remodeling pathways are necessary for the differential expression of <italic>osm-9</italic> we examined <italic>osm-9</italic>p::<italic>gfp</italic> expression in CON and PD animals of strains carrying mutations in genes involved in chromatin remodeling (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5A</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s1">Figure 4—figure supplement 1</xref>). Although both SET-2 histone H3K4 methyltransferase and HDA-2 histone deacetylase act broadly to regulate histone modifications in the genome, their functions are antagonistic and correlate with gene activation or silencing, respectively (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib77">Simonet et al., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Hao et al., 2011</xref>). We found that mutations in <italic>set-2</italic> and <italic>hda-2</italic> resulted in a significant increase in GFP expression in PD ADL neurons compared to wild-type (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5A</xref>). Thus, our results suggest the possibility that SET-2 and HDA-2 are targeting additional gene loci that play a role in the down-regulation of <italic>osm-9</italic> in PD ADL neurons. We also examined the role of ZFP-1 in the regulation of <italic>osm-9</italic> in PD adults, since it has been shown to bind chromatin and is predicted to play a role in the regulation of actively expressed genes through interactions with both chromatin remodeling and RNAi pathways (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Grishok et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Avgousti et al., 2013</xref>). The known function of ZFP-1 is to negatively regulate RNA polymerase II elongation at loci of highly expressed genes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Cecere et al., 2013</xref>).

ZFP-1 is known to bind chromatin; thus, we tested whether <italic>osm-9</italic> is a direct target of ZFP-1. We created strains expressing the <italic>zfp-1</italic> gene tagged with <italic>gfp</italic> specifically in ADL neurons in a <italic>zfp-1(ok554)</italic> mutant. We found that expression of ZFP-1 in ADL partially rescued ascr#3 avoidance behavioral phenotype compared to the <italic>zfp-1</italic> mutant, indicating that the ZFP-1 transgene is functional (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5B</xref>). Next, we performed chromatin immunoprecipitation of ZFP-1 from ADL neurons of CON and PD adults using α-GFP antibodies, followed by qPCR to test for enrichment of ZFP-1 at candidate gene loci. We found that ZFP-1 was significantly enriched at the <italic>osm-9</italic> DBS in PD adults, and enriched at <italic>osm-9</italic> coding sequences in both CON and PD ADL neurons (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5C</xref>). We also examined ZFP-1 enrichment at the <italic>act-3</italic> and <italic>egl-30</italic> loci as positive and negative controls, respectively. These loci have been shown to be ZFP-1 targets using whole worm samples (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Cecere et al., 2013</xref>); however, ZFP-1 enrichment of these loci in ADL neurons was unknown. These results are consistent with ZFP-1 playing a role in the transcriptional gene silencing of <italic>osm-9</italic> in ADL neurons of PD animals.</p><p>Together, our results indicate a role for DAF-3 SMAD, ZFP-1, and endogenous RNAi pathways in the down-regulation of <italic>osm-9</italic> in ADL neurons due to developmental history (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6</xref>). Mutations in individual genes with TGF-β, chromatin remodeling, and RNAi functions resulted in an increase in <italic>osm-9</italic>p::<italic>gfp</italic> expression in PD ADL neurons when compared to wild-type, suggesting that these pathways may be coordinating to silence <italic>osm-9</italic>. Since dauer formation is required for <italic>osm-9</italic> down-regulation, we hypothesized that DAF-3 SMAD binds to the <italic>osm-9</italic> promoter during dauer and recruits ZFP-1 and RNAi machinery to the <italic>osm-9</italic> locus to maintain the silencing to adulthood. To test our hypothesis, we again immunoprecipitated DAF-3 in <italic>mut-16(mg461)</italic> and <italic>zfp-1(ok554)</italic> strains and performed qPCR to examine for DAF-3 enrichment at the <italic>osm-9</italic> DBS. If DAF-3 binds to <italic>osm-9</italic> first and recruits ZFP-1 and RNAi machinery, we would expect to observe DAF-3 enrichment at the <italic>osm-9</italic> PD motif in mutant PD adults. However, our results showed that DAF-3 enrichment was significantly decreased in <italic>mut-16</italic> and <italic>zfp-1</italic> backgrounds at the <italic>osm-9</italic> DBS compared to wild-type (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5D</xref>), while remained enriched at the <italic>daf-8</italic> promoter (positive control). These results indicate that DAF-3 enrichment at the <italic>osm-9</italic> DBS in PD animals is dependent upon functional ZFP-1 and MUT-16. Although we cannot yet address the interactions of these pathways specifically in ADL neurons, our results are consistent with a model that DAF-3 SMAD, ZFP-1, and endogenous RNAi pathways are acting cooperatively to down-regulate <italic>osm-9</italic> as a result of developmental history.<fig id="fig6" position="float"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.11642.041</object-id><label>Figure 6.</label><caption><title>DAF-3, ZFP-1, and RNAi machinery act cooperatively to down-regulate <italic>osm-9</italic> in postdauer ADL neurons.</title><p>Model for developmental programming of <italic>osm-9</italic> gene expression as a result of developmental history.

During continuous growth of <italic>C. elegans</italic> larvae in favorable conditions, DAF-7 TGF-β binds to the DAF-1 and DAF-4 receptors, resulting in a signaling cascade where DAF-3 SMAD is inhibited (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib84">Thomas et al., 1993</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib63">Patterson et al., 1997</xref>).

Expression of OSM-9 TRPV channel in ADL neurons of CON adults results in the avoidance of ascr#3 pheromone (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1D</xref>).</p><p>In stressful environments inducing dauer formation, <italic>daf-7</italic> TGF-β is not expressed, resulting in the de-repression of DAF-3. In this condition, we hypothesize that DAF-3, and possibly DAF-5, inhibit expression of <italic>osm-9</italic> in PD ADL neurons directly by binding to the PD motif (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figures 2A</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">3A,B</xref>). Our results showed that DAF-3 enrichment at the <italic>osm-9</italic> PD motif is dependent upon ZFP-1 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5D</xref>), which may be a direct interaction since both DAF-3 and ZFP-1 are enriched at the DBS in PD adults (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figures 3B</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">5C</xref>). ZFP-1 is also enriched in the gene coding sequence where it is predicted to promote chromatin remodeling and RNA polymerase II stalling (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5C</xref>) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Cecere et al., 2013</xref>). Our results also show that endogenous RNAi pathways are required to maintain the transcriptionally silent state of <italic>osm-9</italic> and for DAF-3 enrichment at the PD motif, although we have not yet determined if this is due to direct and/or indirect targeting of the <italic>osm-9</italic> locus (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figures 4A</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">6</xref>).

Thus, we postulate that phenotypic plasticity of olfactory behavior in wild-type adults is dependent upon developmental history, through modulation of <italic>osm-9</italic> gene expression by TGF-β, endogenous RNAi, and chromatin remodeling pathways.</p><sec id="s3-1"><title>TGF-β and insulin signaling connect environmental conditions to regulation of <italic>osm-9</italic></title><p>In our previous work, we identified 2127 genes that exhibited altered expression levels as a consequence of passage through the dauer stage (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Hall et al., 2010</xref>). One question that arose from this observation was how the dauer developmental signal results in establishment of tissue-specific programmed changes in gene expression. DAF-3 SMAD and DAF-5 SNO/SKI are expressed throughout the worm and are required for dauer formation in unfavorable conditions (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib63">Patterson et al., 1997</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">da Graca et al., 2004</xref>). Here, we argue that DAF-3 and DAF-5 not only promote dauer formation, but also establish altered expression levels of genes due to developmental programming. First, we showed that the differential expression of <italic>osm-9</italic> is dependent upon functional TGF-β signaling during dauer formation, and not just upon passage through the dauer stage (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3A</xref>). In addition, we have shown that DAF-3 binds to the PD motif, and is required for the down-regulation of <italic>osm-9</italic> in PD ADL neurons (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figures 3A,B</xref>). Direct regulation by DAF-3 is an attractive model for how developmental history can result in established gene expression changes for target genes such as <italic>osm-9</italic>. Moreover, competitive binding to the PD motif between DAF-3 and other cell or tissue specific transcription factors can make the developmental programming specific to a cell type (such as ADL) without affecting expression in other cell types (such as AWA). A similar model of regulation by DAF-3 has been postulated for the <italic>myo-2</italic> gene in the pharynx (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib82">Thatcher et al., 1999</xref>). TGF-β signaling has also been shown to regulate neuronal receptor genes based on environmental cues via DAF-3-dependent and independent mechanisms in ASI, AWC, and interneurons (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib56">Nolan et al., 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib42">Lesch and Bargmann, 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib48">McGehee et al., 2015</xref>). Since 977 genes in the genome contain the PD motif and the DAF-3 binding site is enriched in chemoreceptor genes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib46">McCarroll et al., 2005</xref>), we predict that DAF-3 might play a larger role in broadly establishing gene expression changes in response to environmental cues. We are currently testing our model by identifying additional proteins that bind to the PD motif in the <italic>osm-9</italic> gene and by examining expression patterns of other genes containing the PD motif.</p></sec><sec id="s3-2"><title>Endogenous RNAi pathways in neurons regulate phenotypic plasticity</title><p>Our results indicate that endogenous RNAi pathways regulate neuronal gene expression in response to developmental history. Temporal regulation of neuronal gene expression has been shown previously in AWC neurons, whereby DAF-3 establishes expression levels of chemoreceptor genes during early larval stages that are maintained in adults by the homeobox transcription factor ortholog, HMBX-1 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib42">Lesch and Bargmann, 2010</xref>). We propose a similar model where DAF-3/DAF-5 contributes to the down-regulation of <italic>osm-9</italic> in animals that enter the dauer stage, which is dependent upon functional RNAi pathways (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5D</xref>). At this time, we are unable to distinguish whether the requirement of MUT-16 for DAF-3 enrichment at the PD motif is indirect or direct. Our results are consistent with MUT-16 contributing to the positive regulation of <italic>daf-3</italic> expression, silencing of <italic>osm-9</italic> expression, or both (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figures 4</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">5D</xref>). We detected lowly abundant siRNAs homologous to <italic>osm-9</italic> in whole animals (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Hall et al., 2013</xref>); however, the <italic>daf-3</italic> locus is targeted by significant numbers of siRNAs that require MUT-16 and CSR-1 AGO for biogenesis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Claycomb et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib98">Zhang et al., 2011</xref>), which is predicted to positively regulate gene expression by promoting a euchromatic chromatin state at target loci (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib97">Youngman and Claycomb, 2014</xref>). Furthermore, we find that components of the <italic>Mutator</italic> focus play a significant role in the differential regulation of <italic>osm-9</italic> in ADL neurons and modulation of ascr#3 avoidance behavior (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4</xref>). To date, the localization and function of <italic>Mutator</italic> proteins in somatic tissue has been unclear, and some evidence suggests that <italic>Mutator</italic> component MUT-14 only functions within the germline (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib98">Zhang et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib66">Phillips et al., 2014</xref>). However, MUT-2, MUT-7, and the NRDE silencing complex have been shown to play a role in olfactory adaptation mediated by AWC neurons (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">Juang et al., 2013</xref>), and our results indicate that the <italic>Mutator</italic> proteins, MUT-2, MUT-14, MUT-15, and MUT-16, and the associated RdRP RRF-1, function to regulate <italic>osm-9</italic> expression in ADL (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4A</xref>). In addition, we show that MUT-15, MUT-16, and RRF-1 contribute to modulation of ascr#3 avoidance behavior, and that MUT-16 is required in ADL neurons for the plasticity of ascr#3 avoidance due to developmental history (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4B</xref>).</p><p>Moreover, we provide evidence that the ERGO-1/NRDE nuclear silencing pathways contribute to the maintained silencing of <italic>osm-9</italic> in postdauer animals (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4A</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s1">Figure 4—figure supplement 1</xref>). Since the NRDE complex is associated with transcriptional gene silencing, our results suggest that <italic>osm-9</italic> regulation in PD ADL neurons by NRDE is more likely to be a direct interaction. We hypothesize that <italic>Mutator</italic>-amplified siRNAs direct the targeting of the NRDE nuclear silencing complex to the <italic>osm-9</italic> locus, which results in transcriptional gene silencing of <italic>osm-9</italic> in PD ADL neurons. Furthermore, we speculate that siRNAs generated to target the endogenous <italic>osm-9</italic> locus could also direct targeting of the NRDE complex to the ADL-specific <italic>osm-9</italic> rescue transgene, resulting in the transcriptional silencing of the <italic>osm-9</italic> coding sequence in the absence of the upstream regulatory sequences (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1D</xref>). Although we have not shown directly that NRDE-3 targets <italic>osm-9</italic>, regulation by the NRDE complex is an attractive hypothesis, since we have evidence of both RNAi and transcriptional silencing mechanisms playing a role in regulating <italic>osm-9</italic> (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figures 1A,B</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">2,</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">4A</xref>).</p><p>Our results showing that the ERGO-1/NRDE pathway contributes to the down-regulation of <italic>osm-9</italic> in PD adults raises new questions of how RNAi pathways regulate endogenous genes due to developmental history. NRDE-3 must be bound by a siRNA to enter the nucleus and target nascent RNAs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Guang et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Guang et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Burkhart et al., 2011a</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Burkhart et al., 2011b</xref>), which suggests a mechanism for selective siRNA amplification in animals with different developmental histories. This prediction is consistent with our previous findings that PD and CON animals have significantly different small RNA profiles (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Hall et al., 2013</xref>). Further investigation of ERGO/NRDE pathways will be necessary to understand their interactions and roles in the maintenance of gene silencing due to developmental programming.</p></sec><sec id="s3-3"><title>Developmental programming of <italic>osm-9</italic> could contribute to environmental adaptation</title><p>Our results have led us to question why <italic>osm-9</italic> is down-regulated in PD animals. Dauer pheromone has been shown to have both primer and releaser effects on <italic>C. elegans</italic> larval development and adult behaviors, respectively (reviewed in <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib43">Ludewig and Schroeder, 2013</xref>). We speculate that it is advantageous to down-regulate <italic>osm-9</italic> expression in animals that have entered the dauer stage. One possibility is that decreased <italic>osm-9</italic> expression during dauer results in a failure to respond to ascr#3, allowing worms to exit the dauer stage in areas of local high pheromone concentration. <italic>C. elegans</italic> animals that enter the dauer stage due to high population density and do not disperse would have their dauer exit suppressed by the local high concentrations of pheromone (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Golden and Riddle, 1982</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">1984</xref>). Although ADL has not been implicated in dauer recovery to date, down-regulation of <italic>osm-9</italic> could allow dauer animals to become more sensitive to changes in their environment and allow faster dauer recovery when conditions improve (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Gruner et al., 2014</xref>). Second, failure to avoid high concentrations of ascr#3 in postdauer hermaphrodites may serve as a mechanism for increased outcrossing in stressful environments. <italic>C. elegans</italic> males recover from long periods in the dauer stage at higher rates than hermaphrodites, increasing the opportunities for outcrossing in a postdauer population (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib53">Morran et al., 2009</xref>). We postulate that down-regulation of <italic>osm-9</italic> in postdauer hermaphrodites suppresses their dispersal to avoid high concentrations of pheromone, further increasing the opportunities for outcrossing. Thus, we speculate the differential regulation of <italic>osm-9</italic> via developmental programming mechanisms potentially serves to suppress both the primer and releaser effects of pheromone in order to promote survival and reproduction in stressful environmental conditions.</p></sec></sec><sec id="s4" sec-type="materials|methods"><title>Materials and methods</title><sec id="s4-1"><title><italic>C. elegans</italic> strains</title><p>All <italic>C. elegans</italic> strains were generated and maintained by using standard methods (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Brenner, 1974</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib79">Stiernagle, 2006</xref>).

Your article has been reviewed by three peer reviewers, and the evaluation has been overseen by a Reviewing Editor and a Senior Editor.</p><p>The reviewers have discussed the reviews with one another and the Reviewing editor has drafted this decision to help you prepare a revised submission.</p><p>Developmental imprinting is an important process by which early life experiences of an animal stably alters the organism's gene expression and thus physiology and perhaps psychology for life. The question of what molecular mechanisms trigger and maintain this changes is outstanding. In mammals, the circuits involved and their outputs are complex and poorly understood and thus invertebrate models with very simple circuits underlying imprinted behaviors are very attractive. This paper shows that an imprinted locus can be stably regulated by developmental experience by the action of the repressive co-SMAD DAF-3 binding to a specific region of the promoter. The authors used the <italic>osm-9::gfp</italic> as a convenient marker to mark this channel in the ADL neuron. Upon dauer formation via any of 3 mechanisms, the <italic>osm-9</italic> signal in the ADL neuron is eliminated. This ion channel is central to the olfactory sense in the worm, and consistent with this, the postdauer animals show reduced responses to a worm pheromone asc#3. The <italic>osm-9::gfp</italic> approach is clever, and the paper makes full use of worm genetics to narrow down the promoter region, and the mechanisms of transcriptional silencing in these animals. All three reviewers recognized the importance of the question and agree that the authors took the right approach to answer this question.</p><p>However, the reviewers did have some technical concerns that need to be addressed. We would like to invite the authors to respond to these questions in their resubmission.</p><p>First, the ChIP experiment lacks obvious controls. Second, the ChIP experiment lacks cellular resolution, which is important since the locus in question is expressed widely as is DAF-3. The authors also show that the repression of the reporter gene and the postdauer specific behavior requires the mutator locus and chromatin remodeling genes. The evidence for the involvement of these genes is purely genetic. The interpretation of these findings are not clear: could repression of OSM-9 be due to increased transgene silencing in the PD ADL neuron? Could the repression be due to increased DAF-3 down stream of mutator-induced repression of a DAF-3 repressor? They implicate direct interaction of the zinc finger protein ZFP-1 in repression of the promoter by showing it binds directly to the promoter but this does not prove the mutator locus is required for this factor's activity in the PD ADL.</p><p>Thus, to substantiate the claims the authors would need to perform the following experiments:</p><p>Experiment to link DAF-3 to siRNA by performing the <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3B</xref> ChIP in mutator/chromatin remodeling mutant backgrounds.</p><p>Experiment to provide cellular resolution to the repression: express <italic>sre-1::daf-3</italic>::3XFLAG and redo ChIP.</p><p>Experiment to link ZFP-1 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5C</xref> to the mutator and <italic>daf-3</italic>. They should have separated control from PD and looked at ZFP-1 occupancy of the promoter/ gene in <italic>daf-3</italic> mutants, mutator mutant (<italic>mut-16</italic>) as well to ask if DAF-3 is required for ZFP-1 occupancy. This would provide at least an indirect link. Not perfect but approachable.</p><p>Experiment to link endosiRNA pathway to PD negative regulation of <italic>osm-9</italic> would be to do the smFISH in control vs. PD in <italic>mut-16</italic> background (at least one of the endosiRNA mutants).</p><p>ChIP experiments need negative controls: IP from the null background to examine non-specific IP; IP of an unaffected gene (<italic>act-2</italic> was not vetted anywhere in the paper).</p><p>Important but omitted: Better description of the <italic>osm-9</italic> endosiRNA profiles from control and PD… where do they map in the <italic>osm-9</italic> gene?</p><p>Other questions include:</p><p>Avoidance of the pheromone ascr#3 is tested, with the expected results. Can the authors provide control data to show that chemotaxis to unrelated molecules is normal? How specific is this effect-only to ascr#3 or other pheromones and nonpheromonal odorants?</p><p>Related to this, how pervasive is the effect of the postdauer experience on worm biology? The authors are using <italic>osm-9::gfp</italic>, allowing them to focus on a few neurons. But are other parts of the chemosensory circuit also affected by the developmental events? Some evidence for specificity would greatly enhance the conclusions.</p><p>In the last line of the subsection “The TGF-β pathway negatively regulates <italic>osm-9</italic> in postdauer animals” <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3D</xref> should be 3C.</p><p><xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5B</xref> authors should consider using an ampersand, as in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4B</xref>,</p><p>to indicate that the <italic>zfp-1(ok554)::Ex(ADLp::zfp-1::gfp)</italic> value differs from that of <italic>zfp-1(ok554).</italic> </p><p>In the first paragraph of the Discussion the authors may wish to reconsider their use of the term &quot;transcriptional licensing&quot;.</p><p>[Editors' note: further revisions were requested prior to acceptance, as described below.]</p><p>Thank you for resubmitting your work entitled &quot;Developmental programming modulates olfactory behavior in <italic>C. elegans</italic> via endogenous RNAi pathways&quot; for further consideration at <italic>eLife</italic>. Your revised article has been favorably evaluated by a Senior editor, a Reviewing editor, and three reviewers. The manuscript has been improved but there are some remaining issues that need to be addressed before acceptance, as outlined below:</p><p>As you can see, reviewer 2 is still somewhat concerned by the responses provided in the last round of revision. Reviewer 3 has a specific request. Please address reviewer 3's request. Please also add the ADL-specific IPs results since you probably have had time to finish that. Once you have these results, we will consider the revised manuscript and provide a swift decision.</p><p><italic>Reviewer #1:</italic> </p><p>The paper is does not pose any concerns. It does a good job of describing a very intriguing mechanism whereby a ubiquitous SMAD signal coupled with endogenous RNAi programs endow a neuron with plasticity. This is, as far as I know, only the second instance of an environmental cue acting via endogenous RNAi to program plasticity. Very nice.</p><p><italic>Reviewer #2:</italic> </p><p>Sims et al. provide a revision that attempts to delve further into the mechanism by <italic>osm-9</italic> gene regulation is modulated after early life stress. Responses to the concerns that I raised in the initial review are acceptable. I continue to find the observations that developmental history reduces <italic>osm-9</italic> expression, and concomitant reduced sensitivity to pheromone, very interesting. Unfortunately, many of the experiments requested by one of the reviewers produced equivocal or incomplete results. In some cases, necessary controls were unavailable due to technical problems and time constraints for resubmission to <italic>eLife</italic>. Here is a case where the paper was actually weakened, rather than strengthened, through peer review. My sense is that there are a lot of interesting observations here, but there is a lack of conclusive data to support the mechanistic conclusions shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6</xref>. The options would be to give the authors additional time to complete the missing experiments mentioned in the response to reviewers. Alternatively, the authors could back off from the strong conclusions, remove the incomplete data, and resubmit a paper more narrowly focused on the observations that seem robust, but removing the speculation not supported by the data.</p><p><italic>Reviewer #3:</italic> </p><p>The comments I made in my earlier review have been satisfactorily addressed, except for one point that is not clear:</p><p>&quot;The rescue strain expressing ADL-specific ZFP-1 is not significantly different in its behavior. In the manuscript, we describe the ascr#3 avoidance of the rescue strain as &quot;partially restored&quot;.</p><p>If the rescue strain is not significantly different from the mutant, then it's not clear that it has been partially restored.</p><p>As for the comments made by the other reviewers, it seems that the manuscript has been improved. If it would be possible to improve the manuscript much more with a modest extension of the time line, then this would be OK with me.</p></body></sub-article><sub-article article-type="reply" id="SA2"><front-stub><article-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.11642.047</article-id><title-group><article-title>Author response</article-title></title-group></front-stub><body><p><italic>[…] However, the reviewers did have some technical concerns that need to be addressed.

Since a strain carrying <italic>sre-1</italic>p::<italic>daf-3::gfp</italic> did not exist, we 1) cloned the ADL-specific <italic>daf-3</italic> transgene, 2) created stable, extrachromosomal transgene lines, 3) bulked the strains to obtain synchronous stage-specific populations, and 4) performed the IP-qPCR. In order to complete this experiment in a timely manner, we chose to inject wild-type, <italic>mut-16</italic>, and <italic>zfp-1</italic> strains directly with the transgene. We regret that we were unable to obtain a wild-type transgenic line on our first attempt, so that the data may be included in this resubmission. We now have this strain, and are performing the ADL-specific DAF-3 IPs currently. If the editors feel that this experiment is pivotal to our manuscript acceptance, we would happily include this data if granted an extension. We approximate ~ 3 weeks would be necessary to complete the ADL-specific IPs in wild-type animals. Instead, we have included the original DAF-3 enrichment data using an anti-DAF-3 antibody (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3B</xref>) with new positive and negative controls. Our results indicate that DAF-3 enrichment at the potential DAF-3 binding site is significantly higher than CON adults. This observation is consistent with our model that DAF-3 binds <italic>osm-9</italic> after dauer to facilitate silencing.</p><p>In <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6B</xref>, we show ADL-specific DAF-3 enrichment in <italic>mut-16</italic> and <italic>zfp-1</italic> mutant backgrounds as requested. We were able to detect DAF-3 enrichment above background for the positive control in <italic>zfp-1</italic>, indicating that our experiment was successful. Interestingly, the results of this experiment indicate the novel finding that DAF-3 enrichment is dependent upon ZFP-1 activity. In addition, our data showed that both DAF-3 and ZFP-1 bind to the DAF-3 binding site region (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figures 3B</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">5C</xref>), suggesting the possibility of a direct interaction between these two proteins. However, we did not see enrichment of DAF-3 in the <italic>mut-16</italic> background, even at the positive control locus (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6B</xref>). This observation could be due to experiment failure, or alternatively, could reflect the requirement of RNAi pathways to regulate <italic>daf-3</italic> expression as the reviewers suggested. Biogenesis of siRNAs mapping to the <italic>daf-3</italic> locus require functional MUT-16 and CSR-1 proteins (Zhang et al. 2011, Claycomb et al. 2009). Since CSR-1 AGO (bound by MUT-16 amplified siRNAs) promotes gene expression, we hypothesize that <italic>daf-3</italic> expression is decreased in a <italic>mut-16</italic> background. We have preliminary qRT-PCR data that support this hypothesis using mRNA from whole animals; however, additional experiments would be needed to examine MUT-16 dependent <italic>daf-3</italic> expression in ADL specifically. Our overall results cannot distinguish whether RNAi pathways affect <italic>osm-9</italic> regulation by promoting <italic>daf-3</italic> expression, silencing <italic>osm-9</italic> expression, or both. Our results examining the contribution of the NRDE complex to <italic>osm-9</italic> regulation, which promotes transcriptional gene silencing, is consistent with RNAi pathways acting to silence <italic>osm-9</italic> expression in PD ADL neurons and is not consistent with its potential regulation of <italic>daf-3</italic>. Thus, our current model is that RNAi pathways promote <italic>daf-3</italic> expression and silence <italic>osm-9</italic> expression through the action of different Argonaute proteins in PD ADL neurons. Our new model of <italic>osm-9</italic> regulation predicts that DAF-3 and ZFP-1 act cooperatively at the <italic>osm-9</italic> promoter to promote silencing.</p><p><italic>Experiment to provide cellular resolution to the repression: express sre-1::DAF-3::3XFLAG and redo ChIP.</italic> </p><p><italic>Experiment to link ZFP-1 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5C</xref> to the mutator and daf-3. They should have separated control from PD and looked at ZFP-1 occupancy of the promoter/ gene in daf-3 mutants, mutator mutant (mut-16) as well to ask if DAF-3 is required for ZFP-1 occupancy. This would provide at least an indirect link. Not perfect but approachable.</italic> </p><p>Again, we agree with the reviewers that this is an important experiment to test our model of <italic>osm-9</italic> regulation. First, we examined ZFP-1 enrichment at the <italic>osm-9</italic> promoter and gene body in CON and PD wild-type animals. We found that ZFP-1 binds to the <italic>osm-9</italic> gene body in both populations, but shows significant enrichment at the DAF-3 binding site in PD compared to CON (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5C</xref>). This interesting result suggests the possibility that ZFP-1 and DAF-3 may be interacting directly in PD ADL neurons to promote silencing of <italic>osm-9</italic>. Our results showing that DAF-3 enrichment is dependent upon ZFP-1 supports this hypothesis (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6B</xref>). We also examined ZFP-1 enrichment at the <italic>osm-9</italic> locus in <italic>mut-16</italic> and <italic>daf-3</italic> strains, but we were unable to detect ZFP-1 enrichment above background for the positive controls (Figure 6—figure supplement 1). Since the <italic>sre-1</italic>p::<italic>zfp-1::gfp</italic> transgene was genetically crossed into these strains and worked well in the <italic>zfp-1</italic> background (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5C</xref>), we suspect that our unsuccessful experiment in the mutant strains was due to the presence of the endogenous ZFP-1 protein out-competing our tagged version. Ideally, we would need to generate <italic>zfp-1; daf-3</italic> and <italic>zfp-1; mut-16</italic> double mutants carrying the transgene to test this hypothesis, but we did not have the time. However, we were able to show that ZFP-1 differentially binds at the <italic>osm-9</italic> locus in ADL neurons due to developmental history, and contributes to the down-regulation of <italic>osm-9</italic> in PD ADL neurons.</p><p><italic>Experiment to link endosiRNA pathway to PD negative regulation of osm-9 would be to do the smFISH in control vs. PD in mut-16 background (at least one of the endosiRNA mutants).</italic> </p><p>To further link siRNA pathways to the regulation of <italic>osm-9</italic> in PD ADL neurons, we repeated the smFISH experiment to examine <italic>osm-9</italic> mRNA levels in a <italic>mut-16</italic> strain. To perform this experiment, we genetically crossed the <italic>sre-1</italic>p::<italic>gfp</italic> transgene from wild-type (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1B</xref>) into the <italic>mut-16(mg461)</italic> strain. Our results show that <italic>osm-9</italic> mRNA levels in PD ADL neurons of <italic>mut-16</italic> are significantly increased compared to wild-type (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4B</xref>). These results nicely correlate with our <italic>osm-9</italic>p::<italic>gfp</italic> transgene results (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4A</xref>), and indicate that RNAi pathways are contributing to the down-regulation of <italic>osm-9</italic> (either directly or indirectly, see response #1) due to developmental history.</p><p><italic>ChIP experiments need negative controls: IP from the null background to examine non-specific IP; IP of an unaffected gene (act-2 was not vetted anywhere in the paper).</italic> </p><p>We appreciate the reviewers’ suggestion to include additional controls for our ChIP experiments. To address their concerns, our resubmission includes ChIP-qPCR data for the <italic>daf-3</italic> null mutant background for DAF-3 IPs in wild-type (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3B</xref>) and no transgene controls for the ADL-specific ChIP experiments (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figures 5C</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">6B</xref> and Figure 6—figure supplement 1). For each experiment, we normalized the ChIP-qPCR data to a negative control (not a known target) and adjusted the data to the null mutant/no transgene controls to better visualize enrichment. We indicate in the figures which IPs show significant enrichment above the null mutant/no transgene controls. We also included positive and negative controls for enrichment for each experiment. For DAF-3 IPs, we examined enrichment at the <italic>daf-8</italic> and <italic>daf-14</italic> as positive and negative controls, respectively (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figures 3B</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">6B</xref>). We normalized this data to the negative control, <italic>act-2</italic>. These genes have been previously vetted as either targets or non-targets of DAF-3 (Park, Estevez, et al. 2010). For ZFP-1 IPs, we included <italic>egl-30</italic> and <italic>act-3</italic> genes as negative and positive controls, respectively (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5C</xref> and Figure 6—figure supplement 1). Although ZFP-1 was shown to bind to <italic>egl-30</italic> in whole worms (Cecere et al. 2013), to our knowledge, <italic>egl-30</italic> does not show expression in ADL neurons (wormbase.org). <italic>act-3</italic> is a known ZFP-1 target and is expressed in ADL, so we examined this gene as a positive control (Cecere et al. 2013). The ZFP-1 data was normalized to enrichment at <italic>gst-4</italic> (not a known target) (Cecere et al. 2013).</p><p><italic>Important but omitted: Better description of the osm-9 endosiRNA profiles from control and PD… where do they map in the osm-9 gene?</italic> </p><p>To address this concern, we reanalyzed small RNA sequencing data from CON, PD, L3, and dauer whole worms that were previously published (Hall et al. 2013). Unfortunately, we do not yet have small RNA sequencing data from ADL neurons specifically. In addition, the siRNAs mapping antisense to the <italic>osm-9</italic> gene were below the threshold cutoff for enrichment in our previous study; thus, we cannot make solid conclusions about the different numbers of siRNAs in CON versus PD ADL neurons that might be contributing to the differential regulation of osm-9. Despite these limitations, the numbers and mapping locations of the siRNAs homologous to the osm-9 locus in the different developmental stages are indicated in a new <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s2">Figure 4—figure supplement 2</xref>. The results indicate that a majority of the siRNAs map to the 3’ exons of the <italic>osm-9</italic> gene, as expected for secondary siRNAs generated through the action of an RdRP. This analysis is consistent with our hypothesis that siRNAs generated in the endogenous ERGO-1/NRDE pathways are targeting <italic>osm-9</italic> for transcriptional gene silencing in PD ADL neurons.</p><p><italic>Other questions include:</italic> </p><p><italic>Avoidance of the pheromone ascr#3 is tested, with the expected results. Can the authors provide control data to show that chemotaxis to unrelated molecules is normal? How specific is this effect-only to ascr#3 or other pheromones and nonpheromonal odorants?</italic> </p><p>This is an excellent question from the reviewers that we believe we have addressed in our first submission. We have shown that attraction to the odorant diacetyl, which is an OSM-9 dependent and AWA mediated behavior, is unaffected by developmental history (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1</xref>). Avoidance of 1 M glycerol, which is an OSM-9 dependent and ASH mediated behavior, is also unaffected in PD adults (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s2">Figure 3—figure supplement 2</xref>). We have not tested additional pheromone components, since CON adults to do not exhibit an avoidance response to the other major pheromones, such as C3 and C6 (Jang, et al. (2012) Neuron 75: 585-592). We believe that these experiments show that the reduced avoidance to ascr#3 is specific to the downregulation of <italic>osm-9</italic> in PD ADL neurons.</p><p><italic>Related to this, how pervasive is the effect of the postdauer experience on worm biology? The authors are using osm-9::gfp, allowing them to focus on a few neurons. But are other parts of the chemosensory circuit also affected by the developmental events? Some evidence for specificity would greatly enhance the conclusions.</italic> </p><p>We believe that developmental history has profound effects on worm biology that we are just beginning to understand. We have shown previously that brood size and mean life span are significantly altered in PD adults compared to controls (Hall et al. 2010). In addition, we have found significant changes in mRNA levels of numerous genes expressed in neurons between CON and PD, and likely affect multiple behaviors which we hope to address in future work. However, to answer the reviewers’ question, ADL and ASH neurons are both electrically coupled to the RMG interneuron. We only observe significant changes in ADL mediated behavior between CON and PD, while ASH mediated behavior remains unaffected (see response #6). This result would suggest that the remainder of the circuit remains functional, and only ADL function is affected in this study.</p><p><italic>In the last line of the subsection “The TGF-β pathway negatively regulates osm-9 in postdauer animals” <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3D</xref> should be 3C.</italic> </p><p>Thank you for pointing out this mistake.

Responses to the concerns that I raised in the initial review are acceptable. I continue to find the observations that developmental history reduces osm-9 expression, and concomitant reduced sensitivity to pheromone, very interesting. Unfortunately, many of the experiments requested by one of the reviewers produced equivocal or incomplete results. In some cases, necessary controls were unavailable due to technical problems and time constraints for resubmission to eLife. Here is a case where the paper was actually weakened, rather than strengthened, through peer review. My sense is that there are a lot of interesting observations here, but there is a lack of conclusive data to support the mechanistic conclusions shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6</xref>. The options would be to give the authors additional time to complete the missing experiments mentioned in the response to reviewers. Alternatively, the authors could back off from the strong conclusions, remove the incomplete data, and resubmit a paper more narrowly focused on the observations that seem robust, but removing the speculation not supported by the data.</italic></p><p><italic>Reviewer #3:</italic></p><p><italic>The comments I made in my earlier review have been satisfactorily addressed, except for one point that is not clear:</italic></p><p><italic>&quot;The rescue strain expressing ADL-specific ZFP-1 is not significantly different in its behavior.

We previously attempted to answer this question by immunoprecipitating GFP-tagged DAF-3 and ZFP-1 from ADL neurons with little success due to technical and biological reasons. We have since performed DAF-3 immunoprecipitations in <italic>mut-16</italic> and <italic>zfp-1</italic> mutant strains using an α-DAF-3 antibody, and found that DAF-3 binding at the <italic>osm-9</italic> locus in postdauer animals is dependent upon functional ZFP-1 and RNAi pathways (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5D</xref>). To our knowledge, this would be the first report of an interaction between DAF-3 with ZFP-1 and RNAi pathways. Although this experiment does not address the interactions of these pathways in ADL specifically, our new results suggest that these pathways may be acting cooperatively at the <italic>osm-9</italic> locus to facilitate its down-regulation in postdauer animals. As reviewer #2 suggested, we have removed the negative results from the previous revision and simplified our model of <italic>osm-9</italic> regulation, emphasizing that we cannot yet say whether <italic>osm-9</italic> is a direct target of RNAi pathways (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6</xref>).</p><p>2) As Reviewer #1 suggested, we have added the tRNA and non-coding RNA loci present in the <italic>osm-9</italic> intron to our siRNA map in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s2">Figure 4—figure supplement 2</xref>. Only 7 of the 143 siRNAs with homology to <italic>osm-9</italic> overlap with these loci. We have also included the siRNA nucleotide sequences mapping to the <italic>osm-9</italic> locus in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s2">Figure 4—figure supplement 2</xref>—Source data 1.</p><p>3) To address the concerns of Reviewer #3, we have performed an additional two trials to test the ascr#3 avoidance behavior of ADL-specific ZFP-1 rescue lines compared to <italic>zfp-1</italic> mutants. These trials were consistent with our previous data, and have improved the statistical power so that the ZFP-1 rescue lines now exhibit behavior that is significantly different from the <italic>zfp-1</italic> mutant line (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5B</xref>). Since the ascr#3 avoidance of the ZFP-1 rescue lines is also significantly different from wild-type, we have described this result as “expression of ZFP-1 in ADL partially rescued ascr#3 avoidance behavioral phenotype compared to the <italic>zfp-1</italic> mutant”.</p></body></sub-article></article>
