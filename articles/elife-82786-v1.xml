This failure often results from tumor evolution, both genotypic and phenotypic, away from sensitive cell states. Here, we propose a mathematical framework for studying the dynamics of adaptive immune evasion that tracks the number of tumor-associated antigens available for immune targeting. We solve for the unique optimal cancer evasion strategy using stochastic dynamic programming and demonstrate that this policy results in increased cancer evasion rates compared to a passive, fixed strategy. Our foundational model relates the likelihood and temporal dynamics of cancer evasion to features of the immune microenvironment, where tumor immunogenicity reflects a balance between cancer adaptation and host recognition. In contrast with a passive strategy, optimally adaptive evaders navigating varying selective environments result in substantially heterogeneous post-escape tumor antigenicity, giving rise to immunogenically hot and cold tumors.</p></abstract><kwd-group kwd-group-type="author-keywords"><kwd>cancer immunotherapy</kwd><kwd>adaptive resistance</kwd><kwd>stochastic dynamic programming</kwd><kwd>evolutionary biology</kwd></kwd-group><kwd-group kwd-group-type="research-organism"><title>Research organism</title><kwd>None</kwd></kwd-group><funding-group><award-group id="fund1"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100004917</institution-id><institution>Cancer Prevention Research Institute of Texas</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>RR210080</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>George</surname><given-names>Jason T</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund2"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000001</institution-id><institution>National Science Foundation</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>PHY-2019745</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Levine</surname><given-names>Herbert</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><funding-statement>The funders had no role in study design, data collection and interpretation, or the decision to submit the work for publication.</funding-statement></funding-group><custom-meta-group><custom-meta specific-use="meta-only"><meta-name>Author impact statement</meta-name><meta-value>Theoretical modeling reveals how stochastic optimal cancer immune evasion via antigen downregulation gives rise to diverse post-escape cancer antigenic profiles in a manner dependent on the immune microenvironment.</meta-value></custom-meta></custom-meta-group></article-meta></front><body><sec id="s1" sec-type="intro"><title>Introduction</title><p>Cancer dynamics, encompassing both genotypic evolution and phenotypic progression, lies at the heart of treatment failure and disease recurrence, and therefore represents a significant and stubborn therapeutic hurdle. Prior research efforts have made substantial progress in detailing the mathematics of acquired drug resistance (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Iwasa et al., 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib43">Michor et al., 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Komarova, 2006</xref>) and the complementary roles of phenotypic and genotypic changes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Gupta et al., 2019</xref>). Recently, there has been much renewed interest in therapies that utilize the adaptive immune system to confer durable remission (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Couzin-Frankel, 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib57">Waldman et al., 2020</xref>). These latter breakthroughs have generated considerable interest in quantifying the cancer-immune interaction (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">Mayer et al., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib54">Sontag, 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">George et al., 2017</xref>). As with targeted therapeutic resistance via compensatory evolution or adaptive rewiring (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Bergholz and Zhao, 2021</xref>), tumors can similarly evade the immune system via either elimination or downregulation of tumor-associated antigens (TAAs) normally detectable by the T cell repertoire (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib50">Rosenthal et al., 2019</xref>). However, several key features distinguish immune-specific evasion from classical drug resistance (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Komarova, 2006</xref>). Dynamical changes in cancer genotypes and phenotypes, while problematic for conventional therapies, create additional TAAs that may subsequently be recognized by distinct T cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib61">Yarchoan et al., 2017</xref>). Thus, the evolving diversity of the T cell repertoire, consisting of billions of unique clones each with a distinct T cell receptor, provides adaptive immunity and immunotherapy the unique advantage of repeated tumor recognition opportunities (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">George and Levine, 2021</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">Lakatos et al., 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib47">Qi et al., 2014</xref>), making long-term evasion more challenging.</p><p>Previous research efforts have investigated the diversity of evolutionary trajectories and the extent of cancer-immune co-evolution occurring in early disease progression (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">George and Levine, 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">George and Levine, 2020</xref>). These works were based on increasing evidence of significant and sustained tumor evolution driven by immune surveillance (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib56">Turajlic et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Jamal-Hanjani et al., 2017</xref>). Immunosurveillance via distinct T cell clones imposes an adaptive, stochastic recognition environment on developing cancer populations (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Desponds et al., 2016</xref>) that can result either in cancer elimination, escape, or equilibrium (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib53">Schreiber et al., 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Dunn et al., 2004</xref>). Equilibrium results in cancer co-existence with the immune system over large time scales (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib56">Turajlic et al., 2018</xref>), thereby motivating the need for a more complete understanding of the interplay between immune recognition and cancer evolution for effective therapeutic design. In addition to parsing this complexity, the precise extent to which a cancer population may <italic>actively</italic> evade repeated immune recognition attempts is at present unknown.</p><p>Previous modeling efforts have assumed that cancer adaptation occurs passively, that is, without behavior predicated on knowledge of the current immune microenvironment (IME). However, it is well known that cancer populations commonly undergo phenotypic changes capable of altering their immunogenicity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib55">Tripathi et al., 2016</xref>); these changes could be coupled to sensing of the IME in a manner similar to cancer mechanical, chemical, and stress sensing (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Lee et al., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Damaghi et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib48">Rosenberg, 2001</xref>). Moreover, direct experimental evidence demonstrates genetic adaptation in bacterial systems capable of sensing stress and consequently varying the per-cell mutation rate (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Al Mamun et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib49">Rosenberg and Queitsch, 2014</xref>); there appear to be similar stress pathways in cancer (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Bindra et al., 2007</xref>). Therefore, an alternative to passive evolution is for cancer populations to actively sense and evade recognition in the current environment en route to metastasis in a manner that maximally benefits survival, which we refer to henceforth as the ‘optimal escape hypothesis.’ Understanding the extent and associated features of optimized tumor evasion is a crucial first step to identifying the best therapeutic approach, particularly for T cell immunotherapies that may be temporally varied.</p><p>Here, we introduce a mathematical framework, which we call ‘Tumor Evasion via adaptive Antigen Loss’ (TEAL), to quantify the aggressiveness of an evolutionary strategy executed by a cancer population faced with a varying recognition environment. This framework enables a dynamical analysis of both passive and optimized evasion strategies. The TEAL model describes a discrete-time stochastic process tracking the number of targets available to a recognizing adaptive immune system. We apply dynamic programming (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Bellman and Dreyfus, 1959</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib51">Ross, 2014</xref>) in order to solve the corresponding time homogeneous Bellman equation detailing the tumor optimal evasion strategy for a specific example of the assumed penalty for attempting to avoid immune detection. In doing so, we obtain an exact analytical characterization of the evasion policy that maximizes long-run population survival, which we show is the unique solution. We can then quantify the enhancement in survival for optimal threats relative to their passive counterparts under a variety of temporally varying recognition environments. Surprisingly, we find that optimized strategies exhibit substantial diversity in their dynamical behavior, distinguishing them from threats with a fixed evolutionary strategy. Notably, immune recognition efficiency and the IME microenvironment are predicted to influence the likelihood for tumors to either accumulate or lose therapeutically actionable TAAs prior to their escape. The TEAL model represents a first attempt to explicitly represent – and in the future test – the optimal escape hypothesis in order to frame cancer evasion as a dynamic and informed strategy aimed at maximizing population survival.</p><sec id="s1-1"><title>Model development</title><p>In greatest generality, our model consists of an evading clonal population that may be targeted over time by a recognizing system. We assume henceforth that the recognition-evasion pair consists of the T cell repertoire of the adaptive immune system and a cancer cell population, recognizable by a minimal collection of <italic>s</italic><sub><italic>n</italic></sub> TAAs present on the surface of cancer cells in sufficient abundance for recognition to occur over some time interval <inline-formula><mml:math id="inf1"><mml:mi>n</mml:mi></mml:math></inline-formula>. Our focus is on a clonal population, recognizing that subclonal TAA distributions in this model may be studied by considering independent processes in parallel for each clone.</p><p>Experimental evidence and prior modeling suggest that tumors may be kept in an ‘equilibrium’ state of small population size prior to either escape or elimination, with repeated epochs of recognition and evasion (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Dunn et al., 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib56">Turajlic et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">George and Levine, 2020</xref>). We adopt a coarse-grained strategy and assume that during each epoch, the immune system has an opportunity to independently recognize each of the <italic>s</italic><sub><italic>n</italic></sub> TAAs with probability <inline-formula><mml:math id="inf2"><mml:mi>q</mml:mi></mml:math></inline-formula>, and also the cancer population can lose recognized TAAs, each with probability <inline-formula><mml:math id="inf3"><mml:msub><mml:mi>π</mml:mi><mml:mi>n</mml:mi></mml:msub></mml:math></inline-formula>, which we refer to as the <italic>antigen loss rate</italic>. The antigen loss rate is either fixed or chosen by the cancer population using information available in the current period. If the immune system cannot detect any of the available TAAs in a given period, then the cancer population escapes detection. On the other hand, if <inline-formula><mml:math id="inf4"><mml:mstyle displaystyle="true" scriptlevel="0"><mml:mrow><mml:msub><mml:mi>r</mml:mi><mml:mrow><mml:mi>n</mml:mi></mml:mrow></mml:msub><mml:mo>&gt;</mml:mo><mml:mn>0</mml:mn></mml:mrow></mml:mstyle></mml:math></inline-formula> antigens are detected by the adaptive immune system in this time frame, then the cancer population is effectively targeted. This leads to cancer elimination unless the population is able to lose each of the <italic>r</italic><sub><italic>n</italic></sub> recognized antigens during the same period. This loss of recognition would presumably arise in a subpopulation that would then expand at the expense of the successfully targeted cells. If evasion balances recognition and all detected antigens are lost, then equilibrium (non-escape, non-elimination) ensues, and the process repeats in the next period with a new number of target antigens given by a state transition equation<disp-formula id="equ1"><label>(1)</label><mml:math id="m1"><mml:mrow><mml:msub><mml:mi>s</mml:mi><mml:mrow><mml:mi>n</mml:mi><mml:mo>+</mml:mo><mml:mn>1</mml:mn></mml:mrow></mml:msub><mml:mo>=</mml:mo><mml:msub><mml:mi>s</mml:mi><mml:mi>n</mml:mi></mml:msub><mml:mo>−</mml:mo><mml:msub><mml:mi>r</mml:mi><mml:mi>n</mml:mi></mml:msub><mml:mo>+</mml:mo><mml:mi>β</mml:mi><mml:mo>+</mml:mo><mml:msub><mml:mi>f</mml:mi><mml:mi>n</mml:mi></mml:msub></mml:mrow></mml:math></disp-formula></p><p>where <inline-formula><mml:math id="inf5"><mml:mi>β</mml:mi></mml:math></inline-formula> represents the basal rate of new antigen accumulation, and <italic>f</italic><sub><italic>n</italic></sub> represents the addition of new TAA targets dependent on the rate of escape <inline-formula><mml:math id="inf6"><mml:msub><mml:mi>π</mml:mi><mml:mi>n</mml:mi></mml:msub></mml:math></inline-formula> in the current state. We shall refer to <italic>f</italic><sub><italic>n</italic></sub> as the (intertemporal) penalty term, the idea being that changes that lead to antigen loss will out of necessity give rise to the creation of new TAAs, in the form of either overexpressed/mislocalized self-peptides or tumor neo-antigens.</p><p>The model therefore defines a discrete time process that involves changes to both the tumor and the immune system. The process ends in cancer elimination if the cancer population is unable to match all of the <italic>r</italic><sub><italic>n</italic></sub> recognized antigens at any period. The process ends in cancer escape if at any period the number of recognized antigens is zero (<inline-formula><mml:math id="inf7"><mml:mrow><mml:msub><mml:mi>r</mml:mi><mml:mi>n</mml:mi></mml:msub><mml:mo>=</mml:mo><mml:mn>0</mml:mn></mml:mrow></mml:math></inline-formula>). This framework mirrors the outcomes resulting from known tumor-immune interactions, a process that leads via immunoediting to cancer escape, elimination, or equilibrium (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib53">Schreiber et al., 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Dunn et al., 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Dunn et al., 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Koebel et al., 2007</xref>). Here, tumor antigenicity is represented by the total number of post-escape TAAs. We do not distinguish between different types of TAA loss, which may occur through a number of mechanisms, including somatic mutation, epigenetic regulation, or phenotypic alteration.</p></sec><sec id="s1-2"><title>Passive evader</title><p>In the passive case, the cancer population does not change its evasion rate so that <inline-formula><mml:math id="inf8"><mml:mrow><mml:msub><mml:mi>π</mml:mi><mml:mi>n</mml:mi></mml:msub><mml:mo>=</mml:mo><mml:mi>p</mml:mi></mml:mrow></mml:math></inline-formula> is fixed and independent of any of the parameters governing the recognition landscape.

We can more generally apply this approach to understand how an evasion strategy affects the likelihood and timing of cancer escape under a variety of temporally varying recognition landscapes. Such landscapes could, for example, be imposed by a clinician temporally modulating an immunotherapeutic intervention and are routinely proposed in the setting of traditional therapies, where attempted strategies have included a variety of cyclical burst approaches (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Foo and Michor, 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Eigl et al., 2005</xref>). A similar approach could be taken with regard to timing and dosage of adoptive T cell immunotherapy. An advantage of our dynamic programming approach is the ability to study optimal evasion strategies for arbitrary recognition landscapes (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3A</xref>). We simulate TEAL dynamics and find that optimized immune evaders are more successful in evading detection than their passive counterparts across various recognition landscapes (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3B</xref>).

This is not what holds in the impaired case (as will be discussed later), thus suggesting that early cancer progression often proceeds in an environment with effective immune recognition. Additionally, our formula shows that larger mutation rates can be caused by large evasion penalties or by reduced immune recognition. Of course, the TEAL model does not consider any specific features that determine the values of the effective parameters. Instead, its utility is in quantifying the overall effect of reducing antigen detection resulting from, for example, transitions to an immune impaired microenvironment.</p><sec id="s2-5-1"><title>Post-escape tumor antigenicity determined by a balance between recognition aggressiveness and local penalties in the immune microenvironment</title><p>The prior section related recognition and penalty to observed mutation rates. We now consider their combined effects on tumor immunogenicity following immune escape. The TEAL model represents immunogenicity by the number of available TAAs at the time of cancer detection, an important predictor of immunotherapeutic efficacy (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">Martin et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib52">Samstein et al., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Goodman et al., 2017</xref>).

Our results demonstrate that larger penalties result in higher post-escape TAA levels, while efficient immune recognition depletes available TAAs.

Quantitative analytic modeling will continue to provide improved insight into these complex issues by generating fast and affordable predictions and a convenient theoretical framework for hypothesis testing. To date, virtually all of the current models of cancer evolution and the tumor-immune interaction have assumed passive acquired evolution without allowing the tumor to sense and optimally respond to the current fitness landscape in order to maximize future survival. The ‘optimal escape hypothesis’ is, in our opinion, worth exploring in light of the myriad examples of treatment failure and adaptive resistance.</p><p>Our analysis centered on the ability of cancer populations to adaptively respond to a measured immune state, and we have primarily focused on studying subsequent mutations resulting in the disruption of existing (targeted) tumor-associated antigenic targets and on the generation of new ones. It is important to note that independent empirical observations support the ability of cancer cells to sense their IME, and perhaps even the level of CD8+ killing that occurs therein. At the signaling level, IL-6 secreted by CTLs, macrophages, and dendritic cells in response to immune recognition has been shown to directly activate ataxia-telangiectasia mutated (ATM), a factor implicated in response to DNA damage, and this has been associated with increased metastasis and multi-drug resistance in lung cancer (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Jiang et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib60">Yan et al., 2014</xref>). IFN-gamma released by activated CD8+ tumor-infiltrating lymphocytes activates the cell-intrinsic STING pathway in response to DNA damage in cancer, implicating an altered TME from activated CD8+ T cells that is measurable by the cancer (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib59">Xiong et al., 2022</xref>). Lastly, at the level of individual TCR interactions with recognized tumor cells, granzyme B release has been directly linked to DNA damage and associated CHK2 and p53 stress responses, and studies have demonstrated hSMG-1 stress-activated proteins upregulated in cancer cells following granzyme B treatment (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib42">Meslin et al., 2011</xref>). Moreover, granzyme release in the microenvironment serves a signaling molecule promoting a pro-inflammatory response from other immune cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Cullen et al., 2010</xref>). The relatively acute response and short half-lives of downstream effectors (e.g., minutes for p53 and hours for CHK1) provide a tunable response based on the current level of immune targeting through stress-induced mutagenesis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Bindra et al., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib48">Rosenberg, 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib49">Rosenberg and Queitsch, 2014</xref>) that in our analysis directly influences tumor-associated antigen availability.</p><p>Toward this end, we propose and analyze the TEAL model for studying and comparing passive and optimal escape mechanisms in the tumor-immune interaction. We focused our dynamic programming approach on a particular set of relations to provide analytical insight into this process. We do note, however, that the Bellman function approach to dynamic programming can be numerically implemented to obtain solutions for arbitrary functional forms of the penalty function, thereby enabling analysis of more complex assumptions where analytic progress becomes intractable. As expected, threats adopting optimal evasion strategies largely outperform their passive counterparts by increasing the rate of immune escape over prolonged cycles of cancer-immune co-evolution. In the setting of the tumor-immune interaction, the resulting TAAs available for targeting, a proxy for clinical post-detection immunotherapeutic efficacy, are augmented when cancer populations accrue large penalties for evasion and, perhaps surprisingly, when immune recognition is impaired.</p><p>Evasion dynamics of passive and active evaders are similar in some ways while different in others. Similarities include the mean-reverting stationary dynamics of both strategies under efficient immune recognition. However, the TEAL model predicts, for adaptive threats in an excluded pro-tumor IME, the emergence of an unstable state, resulting in either accrual or depletion of TAAs in a manner that depends on the current TAA abundance. This splitting behavior into ‘hot’ and ‘cold’ tumors offers insight into the microenvironmental features generating spatial immunogenic diversity within solid tumors and is consistent with prior observations (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Huss et al., 2021</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Jia et al., 2022</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib41">Meiller et al., 2021</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">Lakatos et al., 2020</xref>). This argues that TAA-depleted tumors share in common the tendency for their evasion strategies to incur less antigenic penalties. Our results suggest the possibility of altering the tumor IME to increase the immunogenicity of immune-cold tumors by making evasion more costly in a manner reminiscent of mutational meltdown (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Gabriel et al., 1993</xref>). We remark that these dynamics are worth considering in the case of adoptive T cell-based immunotherapies, marked by their potential for exerting substantial co-evolutionary pressure on a developing malignancy (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">George and Levine, 2021</xref>). We also predict that impaired immune recognition leads to TAA accumulation, consistent with experimental observations in lung cancer wherein patients with HLA loss of heterozygosity harbored larger mutational burdens, an indirect measure of TAAs of our model (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib40">McGranahan and Swanton, 2017</xref>). Lastly, active evader variable mutation rates also distinguish this case from passive evaders with fixed mutation rates, and this feature is analogous to that observed in bacterial colonies faced with antibiotic selective pressure (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib58">Windels et al., 2019</xref>).</p><p>More generally, the TEAL framework provides a mechanistic basis for several empirical observations. First, our results would suggest that the lower observed TAA availability of hematological malignancies vs. immune-protected solid tumors, such as melanoma (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">Lawrence et al., 2013</xref>), occurs as a result of greater immune accessibility and possible immunoediting of liquid cancers. Second, our model predicts enhanced immune interactions, both natural and treatment-derived, resulting from increasing the cost of immune evasion in the evading cancer population in order to enrich the TAAs following escape. This supports the utility of neo-adjuvant radiation therapy (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">McGranahan et al., 2016</xref>) or chemotherapy (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib44">Mouw et al., 2017</xref>) in inducing immunogenicity. Orthogonal efforts to quantify cancer evolution have similarly predicted the benefit of larger evasion rates resulting in mutational meltdown (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">McFarland et al., 2014</xref>). Integrated together, the TEAL model can predict the balance of generated TAAs given the relative influences of recognition and evasion penalty.</p><p>Tumor antigen depletion is a concerning consequence of immunotherapy since increased recognition is desirable and required for tumor elimination. In solid tumors, one contributor to this problem is T cell exclusion (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib45">Pai et al., 2020</xref>). However, should effective treatment and robust tumor recognition lead to relapse, the resulting tumor has a greater chance of being TAA-depleted (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib50">Rosenthal et al., 2019</xref>). Other strategies that fall in this group include those that effectively reduce recognition, like the presence of T-regulatory cells. Our results suggest that this detrimental effect of targeting can be offset by increasing the ‘hostility of the IME.’ Strategies encourage making tumor adaptation more penalizing, such as fostering an anti-tumor environment by, for example, M1 macrophage polarization, or the inactivation of tumor-associated macrophages (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">Liu et al., 2021</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Goswami et al., 2017</xref>).</p><p>Of course, this foundational model is not without limitation. At present, we have assumed that the recognition agent is not employing an optimized strategy informed by optimal cancer evasion. Instead, we have detailed our results for arbitrarily imputed recognition landscapes, which is useful for predicting the response of an aggressive evader like cancer to particular immunotherapeutic interventions, such as hematopoietic stem cell transplant and adoptive T cell therapy, where the clinician has temporal control over treatment. Identification of such optimal treatment strategies upon quantification of disease evasion aggressiveness is of paramount importance. In this foundational model, we demonstrated the dynamics of immune recognition of an adaptive population of cancer cells expressing a purely clonal pattern of antigens. Our model implicitly equates antigen loss and the progression of a subpopulation currently adapted to evade immune targeting – either by direct pruning of the fittest subclone or by stochastic emergence and subsequent growth of a new one lacking the targeted antigens – as equivalent. Here, we tracked the fittest clone represented by a core set clonal antigens. We remark that heterogeneous populations each having a distinct subclonal signature can also be tracked, but the corresponding antigen-driven selection and fitness cost to each clone would be coupled through shared antigens (see ‘Methods’). Finally, we note that this extended approach implicitly assumes that antigen detection rates over a given period are subclone size-independent, given that antigens are tracked over a period where each of the clones with comparable fitness would be detectable by the immune system during their growth trajectory en route to attempted escape.</p><p>Lastly, cancers characterized by co-evolutionary dynamics resulting in large variability in population size prior to escape or elimination would require in general that recognition and evasion parameters depend on the current period. While possible to incorporate, we have for foundational understanding assumed these to be constant. In this discrete-time evolutionary model, the intertemporal period considered represents the time period between the earliest moment that the adaptive immune system may identify a cancer clone and the latest point after which such a recognition event would no longer be able to prevent cancer escape (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">George and Levine, 2020</xref>). This effectively gives <inline-formula><mml:math id="inf185"><mml:mi>q</mml:mi></mml:math></inline-formula> a probabilistic representation for the total rate of opportunity to recognize a given TAA during cancer progression. Implementing this model in cancer subtype-specific contexts thus requires a consideration of the per-cell division rates, for example.</p><p>We detailed strategies that affect the number of TAAs present following escape. In addition to quantity, variations in individual TAA antigenicity could affect overall immunogenicity, but we do not as yet take this into account. In future work, individual antigenicities could be built in by allowing individual TAA contributions to <italic>s</italic><sub><italic>n</italic></sub> and <inline-formula><mml:math id="inf186"><mml:mi>q</mml:mi></mml:math></inline-formula> to depend on the particular TAA. Many additional features contribute to the immune landscape. Here, we focused on TAA availability and effects of general immune recognition rates and IME hostility on TAA accrual. Future efforts may incorporate additional cancer-specific features, including antigen presentation, immunomodulatory gene expression, and measured immune signatures present in the IME.</p><p>These optimized dynamics are proposed in the absence of the precise mechanistic details of cancer decision-making. Further studies linking changes in the evasion rates to cell signaling are necessary next steps at elucidating a possible mechanism of optimal evasion. Our framework serves as a tool for evaluating the extent of evasion aggressiveness in a variety of observed disease contexts, including cancer. Differentiating dynamics of passive and adaptive evasion mechanisms is a first step to understanding this difference, its importance underscored by the large implications such an understanding would have on our approach to treatment.</p><p>The TEAL model represents a framework broadly applicable for studying population behavior consistent with optimized collective decision-making, and subsequent experimental validation or refutation is of highest priority. Future direction aims to apply this framework for personalizing optimal interventions that maximize disease elimination probabilities. Consequently, stochastic analysis and optimal control theory are indispensable tools for better understanding the complex cancer-immune interaction. Defeating an evolving cancer population has provided a persistent challenge to researchers and clinicians, with the majority of progress heralded by fundamental discoveries on cancer behavior, and additional insights require a more detailed understanding of cancer evasion. The possibility that cancer population-level strategies are somewhat informed to the present recognition threat would have a radical effect on our own optimal treatment approach.</p></sec><sec id="s4" sec-type="methods"><title>Methods</title><sec id="s4-1"><title>Passive evader in an adaptive environment</title><p>Let <inline-formula><mml:math id="inf187"><mml:mstyle displaystyle="true" scriptlevel="0"><mml:mrow><mml:msub><mml:mrow><mml:mi mathvariant="script">S</mml:mi></mml:mrow><mml:mrow><mml:mi>n</mml:mi></mml:mrow></mml:msub></mml:mrow></mml:mstyle></mml:math></inline-formula> denote the set of tumor antigens recognizable by the immune system and present at period <inline-formula><mml:math id="inf188"><mml:mi>n</mml:mi></mml:math></inline-formula> on a population of cancer cells, and let <inline-formula><mml:math id="inf189"><mml:mstyle displaystyle="true" scriptlevel="0"><mml:mrow><mml:msub><mml:mi>s</mml:mi><mml:mrow><mml:mi>n</mml:mi></mml:mrow></mml:msub><mml:mo>=</mml:mo><mml:mrow><mml:mo stretchy="false">|</mml:mo></mml:mrow><mml:msub><mml:mrow><mml:mi mathvariant="script">S</mml:mi></mml:mrow><mml:mrow><mml:mi>n</mml:mi></mml:mrow></mml:msub><mml:mrow><mml:mo stretchy="false">|</mml:mo></mml:mrow></mml:mrow></mml:mstyle></mml:math></inline-formula> count their number (<inline-formula><mml:math id="inf190"><mml:mstyle displaystyle="true" scriptlevel="0"><mml:mrow><mml:mrow><mml:mo stretchy="false">|</mml:mo></mml:mrow><mml:mrow><mml:mi mathvariant="script">A</mml:mi></mml:mrow><mml:mrow><mml:mo stretchy="false">|</mml:mo></mml:mrow></mml:mrow></mml:mstyle></mml:math></inline-formula> denotes the cardinality of set <inline-formula><mml:math id="inf191"><mml:mstyle displaystyle="true" scriptlevel="0"><mml:mrow><mml:mrow><mml:mi mathvariant="script">A</mml:mi></mml:mrow></mml:mrow></mml:mstyle></mml:math></inline-formula>).

<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">Lawrence et al., 2013</xref>). Heuristically, tumors that survive while accumulating an average of <inline-formula><mml:math id="inf324"><mml:mrow><mml:mi>β</mml:mi><mml:mo>+</mml:mo><mml:mi>f</mml:mi></mml:mrow></mml:math></inline-formula> targetable alterations must balance those gains by <inline-formula><mml:math id="inf325"><mml:mrow><mml:mi>β</mml:mi><mml:mo>+</mml:mo><mml:mi>f</mml:mi></mml:mrow></mml:math></inline-formula> additional evasion events. This theory predicts, perhaps surprisingly, that the mutation rate is a direct reflection of the penalty paid for cancer progression as a function of the basal antigen arrival rate and contributions from the local environment. Tumors having a more difficult time surviving in a hostile or restrictive environment would be predicted to have higher rates of mutation. In this context, high mutational signatures are predicted to be correlated with tumors that are more susceptible to recognition. For a passive Evader, our theory predicts that the observed mutation rate depends only on basal arrival and mean penalty term for cancer progression, unaffected by recognition rate. On the other hand, the stationary number of available antigens, approximated by <inline-formula><mml:math id="inf326"><mml:mrow><mml:mover accent="true"><mml:mi>μ</mml:mi><mml:mo stretchy="false">~</mml:mo></mml:mover><mml:mo>=</mml:mo><mml:mrow><mml:mrow><mml:mo stretchy="false">(</mml:mo><mml:mrow><mml:mi>β</mml:mi><mml:mo>+</mml:mo><mml:mi>f</mml:mi></mml:mrow><mml:mo stretchy="false">)</mml:mo></mml:mrow><mml:mo>/</mml:mo><mml:mi>q</mml:mi></mml:mrow></mml:mrow></mml:math></inline-formula>, varies directly with evasion penalty and inversely with antigen recognition rate. Moreover, mutation or adaptation accumulation is expected to converge to a stable steady state for all allowable recognition, evasion, and penalty rates.</p></sec><sec id="s4-5"><title>Active evader in an adaptive environment</title><p>In the previous section, we considered the predicted dynamical behavior when the Evader is assumed to adopt a fixed strategy. In that case, if number of detectable antigens is moderately large (<inline-formula><mml:math id="inf327"><mml:mrow><mml:msub><mml:mi>s</mml:mi><mml:mn>0</mml:mn></mml:msub><mml:mo>∼</mml:mo><mml:mn>10</mml:mn></mml:mrow></mml:math></inline-formula>), then the game is biased against the Evader for most combinations of evasion and recognition success probabilities (Section Break-even probability). Additionally, mean transitions in the number of recognizable antigens obey an AR(1) process tending toward the quotient of the mean penalty and recognition rate (Section Mean transition behavior). Moreover, this behavior predicts that the observed mutation accumulation rate is linear in time and proportional to the sum of basal antigen creation rate and mean penalty term (Section Mutation accumulation rate and tumor antigen availability). Here, we allow for the Evader to optimally select his evasion rate <inline-formula><mml:math id="inf328"><mml:msub><mml:mi>π</mml:mi><mml:mi>n</mml:mi></mml:msub></mml:math></inline-formula> at each period (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s3">Figure 1—figure supplement 3</xref>). Larger success rates come at the cost of adding back more recognition opportunities in the subsequent time step, so that the Evader employs a strategy to maximize his survival or likelihood of escape. This framework is motivated by the observation that cancer threats are known to accumulate perhaps mildly deleterious mutations that occur passively during evolution to obtain rare ‘driver’ mutations (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">McFarland et al., 2014</xref>). The novelty here is that we propose a unifying theoretical framework to investigate the resulting strategy employed by a cancer population if the choice of evasion is planned based on knowledge of the current antigen landscape and hostility, or number of recognized targets.</p><p>In contrast with the prior section, which considered temporal evolution as a function of fixed evasion rate <inline-formula><mml:math id="inf329"><mml:mi>p</mml:mi></mml:math></inline-formula> and random penalty <italic>f</italic><sub><italic>n</italic></sub>, here, the evasion rate <inline-formula><mml:math id="inf330"><mml:msub><mml:mi>π</mml:mi><mml:mi>n</mml:mi></mml:msub></mml:math></inline-formula> may depend on time, and for simplicity we consider deterministic penalties.

Our results predict that the resulting tumor becomes ‘warm’ or ‘cold’ depending on the extent of new TAA arrival during active evasion. On the one hand, impaired recognition leads to diverse behavior dependent on the rate at which new TAAs are acquired during active evasion. If this acquisition rate is large, then the tumor accumulates TAAs over time to become ‘hot.’ On the other hand, tumors subject to reduced selection pressures may evolve as immune-hot or immune-cold tumors, consistent with previous observations (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">Lakatos et al., 2020</xref>). Moreover, the effect of reducing immune recognition leads to an accumulation of TAAs over time, consistent with experimental observations in lung cancer wherein patients with HLA loss of heterozygosity harbored larger mutational burdens, an indirect measure of TAA number of our model (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib40">McGranahan and Swanton, 2017</xref>). Our predictions suggest that immunogenicity ultimately depends on the number of detectable TAAs at the time of impaired immune recognition, suggesting that TAA-depleted tumors share in common the tendency for their evasion strategies to incur less antigenic penalties. Our results would predict the utility of altering the tumor microenvironment to increase the immunogenicity of immune-cold tumors by making evasion more costly in a manner reminiscent of mutational meltdown (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Gabriel et al., 1993</xref>). We remark that these dynamics are worth considering in the case of adoptive T cell-based immunotherapies, which have a large potential for exerting substantial co-evolutionary pressure on a developing malignancy (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">George and Levine, 2021</xref>).</p></sec></sec><sec id="s4-8"><title>Survival benefit of active evasion</title><p>From the above analysis, immunogenicity dynamics of an active Evader are closest to those of a mean-reverting passive Evader under the pro-tumor-infiltrated case. Given this, we study the dynamics under active and passive evasion as well as the distribution of escape times and probability of escape (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2</xref>). For a reasonable comparison, we fix <inline-formula><mml:math id="inf465"><mml:mi>q</mml:mi></mml:math></inline-formula> and <inline-formula><mml:math id="inf466"><mml:msup><mml:mi>s</mml:mi><mml:mo>*</mml:mo></mml:msup></mml:math></inline-formula> for each case, and the passive evasion rate <inline-formula><mml:math id="inf467"><mml:mi>p</mml:mi></mml:math></inline-formula> is chosen to match the stationary mean optimal evasion rate <inline-formula><mml:math id="inf468"><mml:msup><mml:mi>π</mml:mi><mml:mo>*</mml:mo></mml:msup></mml:math></inline-formula>. Our simulations result in escape occurring 1.6 times more frequently under active evasion. Moreover, active evasion exhibits a broader distribution of elimination and escape times (Mean Passive Escape = 6.0, Var Passive Escape = 25.0, Mean Passive Elimination = 6.1, Var Passive Elimination = 30.1; Mean Active Escape = 7.2, Var Active Escape = 35.8, Mean Active Elimination = 6.7, Var Active Elimination = 38.0). Our results demonstrate that active evasion allows an Evader to adapt to the observed recognition and, despite continual penalty, allows an Evader to ‘out-wait’ a Recognizer in order to undergo escape.</p></sec><sec id="s4-9"><title>Exogenous recognition</title><p>One powerful advantage of this approach is that the theoretical predictions are not limited by the underlying distribution of <italic>r</italic><sub><italic>n</italic></sub> driving the process.

The model is mathematically rigorous and addresses an important and timely problem.

Tumor clones proliferate and compete, each with its own fitness under the changing selection pressure from the immune system. However, the model here does not address tumor cells or clones, but rather the presented antigens as independent particles. While this is not an unreasonable choice, it does require better discussion and justification.</p><p>A major ingredient of the model is the penalty for immune evasion – in which while evading immune recognition of certain TAAs, a tumor will develop new ones as potential new targets for the immune system. This is presented in an opaque way, with several assumptions and specific mathematical forms. There should be some tradeoff between immune escape and loss of function, that would lead to such a penalty, and it should be made more concrete and transparent.</p><p>The idea that cancer can sense and respond to the immune system and the tumor microenvironment is exciting and intriguing but therefore requires stronger evidence. It would be valuable to make more connections to known observations to support this type of model. This is especially true since some of the model &quot;predictions&quot;, like the correlation between lower immune surveillance and tumor mutational burden, are known from simpler principles.</p><p>And more generally, language and notation should be improved throughout the manuscript, making it easier to follow. Some jargon should be discouraged or explained, like &quot;date-n&quot; or &quot;mean evolution dynamics&quot; (section 3.1). A phase-space-like diagram of the different parameters' regimens of the model (maybe β and q?) would also be extremely useful.</p><p>The definition of eta is confusing. The manuscript states: 'eta may be interpreted as the probability of the complement of the following event: &quot;recognition occurs without matched evasion for a single antigen&quot;. In other words, eta is the probability of a tie at a single antigen position.' But the complement of that event also includes the probability of no recognition, on top of a tie, unless I misunderstood what tie means. Regardless, tie is a confusing term here and should at least be explained better.</p><p><italic>Reviewer #2 (Recommendations for the authors):</italic></p><p><italic>Reviewer #3 (Recommendations for the authors):</italic></p><p>Developing such conceptual models is important and has the potential to inspire the wider field. However, I fear that some of that full potential might not be reached without additional work rewriting the text for greater clarity and precision. The following are some suggestions that might be helpful in that regard.</p><p>To start with, I had a hard time following some of the terminology. There are some instances where different terms are used to refer to the same concept. For instance, in Figure 1C the terminology changes between the legend (evasion rate) and plot (optimal downregulation attempt probability). Furthermore, the terminology seems overloaded: π is referred to as an evasion probability, but maybe one would want to reserve this term for the complete evasion of immune recognition by cancer. π might be more simply referred to as a rate of antigen loss, or similar. I was also wondering whether it would make sense to directly include β in Eq.1 and separate it from the penalty term. I understood penalty to refer to the increase in antigen creation rate when π is higher. From the equation, β instead could be more aptly named a basal rate of antigen creation. Lastly, notations should be uniformized. Specifically, I noted that in the methods the rate at which TAAs are lost is denoted by p instead of pi, if I understand correctly, which can cause confusion for the reader.</p></body></sub-article><sub-article article-type="reply" id="sa2"><front-stub><article-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.82786.sa2</article-id><title-group><article-title>Author response</article-title></title-group></front-stub><body><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Essential revisions:</p><p>As you can see below, the scope and mathematical effort in your manuscript were greatly appreciated by all reviewers.

First, we have changed the language describing the evasion probability and the rate of Tumor-Associated Antigen (TAA) loss (π<sub>n</sub>). We have also re-structured the presentation of the evasion penalty to separate out the decision-dependent (π<sub>n</sub>) term, now given by <italic>f<sub>n</sub></italic>, from the decision-independent contribution given by the β which is more aptly referred to as the basal antigen creation rate throughout the manuscript. The first use of fixed π<italic><sub>n</sub></italic> equal to <italic>p</italic> has been clarified in the Methods section.</p><p>Two of the reviewers had suggested that there is a degree of confusion in discussing the <italic>tie probabilities</italic> in this process. In an effort to clarify our approach, we now replace that language with the idea of <italic>tumor-immune equilibrium</italic> in order to keep the discussion grounded in Schreiber’s widely accepted conceptual framework of the ‘Three E’s (Elimination, Escape, Equilibrium) of Immunoediting’. The language has now been changed in the Results and Methods sections and described explicitly in the Introduction:</p><p>“Immunosurveillance via distinct T cell clones imposes an adaptive, stochastic recognition environment on a developing cancer population (Desponds et al. <italic>PNAS</italic> 2016) that can result either in cancer elimination, escape, or equilibrium (Dunn et al. <italic>Annu Rev Immunol</italic> 2004). Equilibrium results in cancer co-existence with the immune system over large time scales (Turajlic et al. <italic>Cell</italic> 2018) thereby motivating the need for a more complete understanding of the interplay between immune recognition and cancer evolution for effective therapeutic design.”</p><p>We appreciate the editor’s suggestion of a phase diagram to graphically depict the important parameter regions in question and have now added this graphical aid to Figure 5 to clarify the relevant regimes corresponding to those cases.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>2) The process of Clonal cancer evolution should be better discussed in relation to the model, which describes the dynamics of mutations but does not follow clones.</p></disp-quote><p>It has been correctly noted that our model does not attempt to deal with possible subclonal structure of the tumor. This possibility introduces additional complications into the model formulation and we wanted to first establish the basic idea of “adaptive evasion” in the simplest context. In an attempt to illustrate how reasonable future generalizations of our model could include nontrivial sub-clonal heterogeneity in tumor antigens tracked through time, we now describe how one would go about enhancing the existing model to address this. The following has been added to the Methods and Discussion sections:</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Addition to Methods: “The above describes a clonal population harboring a core minimal set of TAAs for which recognition and down-regulation ultimately determine cancer escape, elimination, or equilibrium. Our model can however be adapted to study the more general scenario involving a clonal hierarchy of heterogeneous cancer cells. We illustrate this by considering a population of cells with a set C of c = | C | core clonal TAAs, together with distinct groups of cells with subclonal collections of TAAs S<sub>1</sub> and S<sub>2</sub> (having size s<sub>1</sub> = |S<sub>1</sub>| and s<sub>2</sub> = |S<sub>2</sub>|, respectively). The relevant populations therefore have antigen sets given by P<sub>1</sub> = CUS<sub>1</sub> and P<sub>2</sub> = CUS<sub>2</sub>. The basic event considered in the foundational model, [r<sub>n</sub> &gt; 0], must now be replaced by the event that recognition occurs in both P<sub>1</sub> and P<sub>2</sub>; in the absence of recognition of both subclones, the cancer escapes. Recognition happens either if there is a recognition event r in C or if there are simultaneous recognition events r<sub>1</sub> in S<sub>1</sub> and r<sub>2</sub> in S<sub>2</sub>. Assuming that TAA recognition occurs independently as before with probability q, the total probability of relevant recognition, originally (1−γ<sup>sn</sup>), is now given by (1−γ<sup>c</sup>) +γ<sup>c</sup>(1−γ<sup>r1</sup>)(1− γ<sup>r2</sup>). The first term characterizes the coupling of the fate of both subclones should a common TAA be recognized, while the latter term represents the parallel recognition process required to control each subclone separately via subclonal TAA recognition. Lastly, assuming that recognition proceeds either by a shared TAA in C or instead by subclonal TAAs in both S<sub>1</sub> and S<sub>2</sub>, then the probability of elimination and progression proceed identically as before. In the remainder of the discussion, we will, for baseline understanding, only track a core set of clonal antigens on the fittest clone.”</p></disp-quote><p><italic>Addition to Discussion: “</italic>In this foundational model, we demonstrated the dynamics of immune recognition of an adaptive population of cancer cells expressing a purely clonal pattern of antigens. Our model implicitly equates antigen loss and the progression of a subpopulation currently adapted to evade immune targeting – either by direct pruning of the fittest subclone or by stochastic emergence and subsequent growth of a new one lacking the targeted antigens – as equivalent. Here, we tracked the fittest clone represented by a core set clonal antigens. We remark that heterogeneous populations each having a distinct sub-clonal signature can also be tracked, but the corresponding antigen-driven selection and fitness cost to each clone would be coupled through shared antigens (see Methods). Finally, we note that this extended approach implicitly assumes that antigen detection rates over a given period are subclone size-independent, given that antigens are tracked over a period where each of the clones with comparable fitness would be detectable by the immune system during their growth trajectory en route to attempted escape.”</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>3) The claim that the cancer cells are sensing the immune system is a bold and intriguing one, and as such need to be better supported, or otherwise, it is hard to justify.</p></disp-quote><p>We are grateful to the editor and reviewers for requesting that this point be made more explicitly. The rheostat for stress that was previously discussed in the initial draft was specific for stress responses that lead to increased mutagenesis in yeast and hypoxia-driven responses in cancer. While this is indicative of a cell’s capability of an adaptive response, it did not specifically relate this possibility to the actions of the immune system. What we have now included is a direct connection between T-cell activity and this response, which is known to occur both indirectly, in the setting of immune-mediated cytokine release following T cell recognition, and as a result of T cell targeting directly. In an attempt to present concrete connections to empirical observations in support of this phenomenon, we have added the following paragraph to the Discussion section:</p><p>“Our analysis centered on the ability of cancer populations to adaptively respond to a measured immune state, and we have primarily focused on studying subsequent mutations resulting in the disruption of existing (targeted) tumor-associated antigenic targets and on the generation of new ones. It is important to note that independent empirical observations support the ability of cancer cells to sense their immune microenvironment (IME), and perhaps even the level of CD8<sup>+</sup> killing that occurs therein. At the signaling level, IL-6 secreted by CTLs, macrophages, and dendritic cells in response to immune recognition has been shown to directly activate ataxia-telangiectasia mutated (ATM), a factor implicated in response to DNA damage, and this has been associated with increased metastasis and multi-drug resistance in lung cancer (Jiang et al. <italic>Oncotarget</italic> 2015; Yan et al. <italic>Cancer Science</italic> 2014). IFN-γ released by activated CD8<sup>+</sup> tumor-infiltrating lymphocytes activates the cell-intrinsic STING pathway in response to DNA damage in cancer, implicating an altered TME from activated CD8<sup>+</sup> T-cells that is measurable by the cancer (Xiong et al. <italic>Oncoimmunology</italic> 2022). Lastly, at the level of individual TCR interactions with recognized tumor cells, Granzyme B release has been directly linked to DNA damage and associated CHK2 and p53 stress-responses, and studies have demonstrated hSMG-1 stress-activated proteins upregulated in cancer cells following granzyme B treatment (Meslin et al. <italic>J Mol Med</italic> 2011). Moreover, granzyme release in the microenvironment serves a signaling molecule promoting a pro-inflammatory response from other immune cells (Cullen et al. <italic>Cell Death Differentiation</italic> 2010). The relatively acute response and short half-lives of downstream effectors (minutes for p53 and hours for CHK1, for example), provide a tunable response based on the current level of immune targeting through stress-induced mutagenesis (Bindra et al. <italic>Cancer Met Rev</italic> 2007; Rosenberg <italic>Nat Rev Genetics</italic> 2001; Rosenberg, Queitsch. <italic>Science</italic> 2014) that in our analysis directly influences tumor-associated antigen availability.”</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Reviewer #1 (Recommendations for the authors):</p><p>The actual evolutionary process in the tumor happens on the level of cells and clones. Tumor clones proliferate and compete, each with its own fitness under the changing selection pressure from the immune system. However, the model here does not address tumor cells or clones, but rather the presented antigens as independent particles. While this is not an unreasonable choice, it does require better discussion and justification.</p></disp-quote><p>We thank the reviewer for their helpful comments. We remark that our model implicitly equates antigen loss and the progression of a subpopulation currently adapted to evade immune targeting – either by direct pruning of the fittest subclone or by stochastic emergence and subsequent growth of a new one lacking the targeted antigens – as equivalent. The foundational analysis was conducted on a clonal antigenic structure assuming a minimal collection of TAAs that required targeting for a change in equilibrium to either escape or elimination. Because we for foundational understanding studied the case where a single clonal signature was tracked in time, we under-explained the implementation of such a model in more complicated cases.</p><p>The next most complicated scenario involves a heterogeneous population of cancer cells with disjoint neoantigen profiles. In this case, a parallel process can be studied wherein the effects of recognition in one environment are decoupled from the other (relevant to, for example, spatially distinct subpopulations). This description however misses the case where such disparate populations evolve to express shared antigens, or in the case where there are both clonal and subclonal antigen targets. Here, our model can still be applied in parallel to study distinct clones but requires additional structure. Namely, in this case we would need to incorporate non-trivial coupling between the possible recognition/selection against certain antigens shared across clones. For example, control of a population with clonal antigens {<italic>a, b</italic>} but having unique subclones having either antigens {<italic>w,x</italic>} or {<italic>y</italic>,<italic>z</italic>} could be considered by studying the process in parallel, and control in the next periods would require recognition/selection against either (1) at least one of {w,x} <italic>and at least one of</italic> {<italic>y,z</italic>}, or (2) at least one of {<italic>a</italic>,<italic>b</italic>}. In this more general framework, the arrival of new subclones with distinct features from the parent clone in question could also be incorporated and studied across time periods. This strategy of subdividing more complicated evolutionary structures has now been further elaborated on in the Methods section, and we have expounded these points in the discussion (see additions given under Editor Comment 2).</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>A major ingredient of the model is the penalty for immune evasion – in which while evading immune recognition of certain TAAs, a tumor will develop new ones as potential new targets for the immune system. This is presented in an opaque way, with several assumptions and specific mathematical forms. There should be some tradeoff between immune escape and loss of function, that would lead to such a penalty, and it should be made more concrete and transparent.</p></disp-quote><p>Indeed, the clarity of this balance between TAAs both lost and generated was discussed in an excessively complicated way. In order to add more clarity, we have isolated the basal arrival of TAAs from the penalty term. In doing so, the assumptions on the functional form for penalty is simplified to be directly proportional to the rate of TAA loss and distinct from any r<sub>n</sub>,π<sub>n</sub>-independent TAA additions fully characterized by the β term. We have also clarified these points early in the model development section at the point where β and penalty terms <italic>f</italic><sub>n</sub> are described: XXX</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>The idea that cancer can sense and respond to the immune system and the tumor microenvironment is exciting and intriguing but therefore requires stronger evidence. It would be valuable to make more connections to known observations to support this type of model. This is especially true since some of the model &quot;predictions&quot;, like the correlation between lower immune surveillance and tumor mutational burden, are known from simpler principles.</p></disp-quote><p>We thank the reviewer for this helpful suggestion since our original presentation omitted all but one sentence on the precise molecular details of how this may occur. The rheostat on stress that was previously discussed was specific for stress responses that lead to increased mutagenesis in yeast and hypoxia-driven responses in cancer. What should have been included was a direct connection between T-cell activity and this response, which is known to occur both indirectly, in the setting of immune-mediated cytokine release following T cell recognition, and as a result of T cell targeting directly. In an attempt to make concrete connections to empirical observations in support of this phenomenon, we have added these points in the Discussion section (see additions given under Editor Comment 3).</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>And more generally, language and notation should be improved throughout the manuscript, making it easier to follow. Some jargon should be discouraged or explained, like &quot;date-n&quot; or &quot;mean evolution dynamics&quot; (section 3.1). A phase-space-like diagram of the different parameters' regimens of the model (maybe β and q?) would also be extremely useful.</p></disp-quote><p>We thank the reviewer for suggesting helpful additions to aid in presentation clarify. Specifically, we have removed excessive jargon (‘date-<italic>n</italic>’) and have expanded upon what we mean by mean evolution dynamics. The thought of adding a phase-space diagram for a visual map of the model’s key regimes is a great suggestion, and we have now added this to Figure 5.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>The definition of eta is confusing. The manuscript states: 'eta may be interpreted as the probability of the complement of the following event: &quot;recognition occurs without matched evasion for a single antigen&quot;. In other words, eta is the probability of a tie at a single antigen position.' But the complement of that event also includes the probability of no recognition, on top of a tie, unless I misunderstood what tie means. Regardless, tie is a confusing term here and should at least be explained better.</p></disp-quote><p><italic>ղ</italic> = 1−<italic>q</italic>(1−<italic>p</italic>) is by definition the probability complement of <italic>q</italic>(1−<italic>p</italic>), which is the probability for a single recognition event without antigen loss (at that one position). The reviewer is correct that this event can occur either via no antigen recognition (so a ‘tie’ occurs at that position by default), or by recognition at that position being matched by antigen loss.</p><p>To make this clearer and to remove the ‘tie’ interpretation out of the description, we now explain that balanced recognition and evasion is referred to as ‘equilibrium’, which needs to occur for any and all antigens that are recognized for the process to avoid escape or elimination, but that we can also characterize the probability that a single antigen is in equilibrium. In this way, <italic>ղ</italic> represents the probability that equilibrium exists in one antigen position provided that there is at least one available antigen for immune targeting.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Reviewer #3 (Recommendations for the authors):</p><p>Developing such conceptual models is important and has the potential to inspire the wider field. However, I fear that some of that full potential might not be reached without additional work rewriting the text for greater clarity and precision. The following are some suggestions that might be helpful in that regard.</p><p>To start with, I had a hard time following some of the terminology. There are some instances where different terms are used to refer to the same concept. For instance, in Figure 1C the terminology changes between the legend (evasion rate) and plot (optimal downregulation attempt probability). Furthermore, the terminology seems overloaded: π is referred to as an evasion probability, but maybe one would want to reserve this term for the complete evasion of immune recognition by cancer. π might be more simply referred to as a rate of antigen loss, or similar. I was also wondering whether it would make sense to directly include β in Eq.1 and separate it from the penalty term. I understood penalty to refer to the increase in antigen creation rate when π is higher. From the equation, β instead could be more aptly named a basal rate of antigen creation. Lastly, notations should be uniformized. Specifically, I noted that in the methods the rate at which TAAs are lost is denoted by p instead of pi, if I understand correctly, which can cause confusion for the reader.</p></disp-quote><p>We thank the reviewer for their thorough review and thoughtful suggestions. We have addressed some the issues above, which we believe enhances the clarity of the new draft. In taking the reviewer’s suggestion, we now describe π as the rate of antigen loss, reserving ‘evasion probability’ for discussions involving complete immune evasion.</p><p>We very much like the suggestion of isolating/emphasizing the β basal rate of antigen creation from the penalty (in the strict sense) incurred for choosing larger π<sub>n</sub>. This is a clearer way to present the Results section that already assumed β to be <italic>r</italic><sub>n</sub>,π<italic><sub>n</sub></italic>-independent. Toward this end, we have added this to Eq. 1 and discuss it thereafter, and we have made the additional updates to the other Results sections where β and <italic>f<sub>n</sub></italic> are mentioned.</p><p>Our reason for describing the TAA loss rate with <italic>p</italic> and π<italic><sub>n</sub></italic> separately is to emphasize when it is simply a passive feature (π<sub><italic>n</italic></sub> = <italic>p</italic> fixed) versus when it is actively chosen. This was distinguished in the Model Development section but was previously confusing given the initial use of <italic>p</italic> followed by π<italic><sub>n</sub></italic>. For clarity, we have now elaborated at the first mention of the antigen loss rate: “The rate of antigen loss π<italic><sub>n</sub></italic> may in general vary as a function of time and environmental features (considered in Sec. 5.2). In this section, we assume it is passively fixed and denote this rate as <italic>p</italic>.</p></body></sub-article></article>
