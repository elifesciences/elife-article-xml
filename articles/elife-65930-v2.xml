detect sounds by transducing mechanical vibrations into electrical signals. From the top surface of each hair cell protrudes a mechanical antenna, the hair bundle, which the cell uses to detect and amplify auditory stimuli, thus sharpening frequency selectivity and providing a broad dynamic range. Current methods for mechanically stimulating hair bundles are too slow to encompass the frequency range of mammalian hearing and are plagued by inconsistencies. To overcome these challenges, we have developed a method to move individual hair bundles with photonic force. This technique uses an optical fiber whose tip is tapered to a diameter of a few micrometers and endowed with a ball lens to minimize divergence of the light beam. Here we describe the fabrication, characterization, and application of this optical system and demonstrate the rapid application of photonic force to vestibular and cochlear hair cells.</p></abstract><abstract abstract-type="executive-summary"><title>eLife digest</title><p>The sense of hearing relies on specialized sensory cells in the inner ear. Each of these hair cells converts sounds into electrical signals that the brain can interpret. The hair cell takes its name from the bundle of rod-like structures that protrude from its top surface, which resemble hairs under the microscope. The hair bundle acts as an antenna that bends in response to sound waves. When a hair bundle moves in a particular direction, it opens ion channels in the hair-cell membrane. The resulting flow of ions into the cell triggers a cascade of events that ends with an electrical signal traveling to the brain.</p><p>Many experiments on hearing rely on being able to manipulate the movement of a hair bundle. Researchers typically use one of two methods to achieve this. In the first, a flexible glass fiber pushes against the hair bundle, whereas the second involves a jet of fluid directed against the cell. Neither of these techniques can move hair bundles fast enough for researchers to explore the vast range of sound frequencies that human ears can detect. What is more, both methods are prone to introducing errors into experiments.</p><p>Abeytunge, Gianoli et al. have developed a new method for moving hair bundles, this time with the aid of light. When light interacts with objects it exerts a photonic force. Abeytunge, Gianoli et al. show that a tapered optical fiber with a miniscule rounded lens can focus a laser beam to deliver enough photonic force to move a hair bundle. The laser beam does not damage the hair bundle, but moves it fast enough to allow researchers to study a broader range of mammalian hearing, while avoiding the errors that have bedeviled previous methods.</p></abstract><kwd-group kwd-group-type="author-keywords"><kwd>hair cell</kwd><kwd>mechanotransduction</kwd><kwd>photonic force</kwd><kwd>frog</kwd><kwd>vestibular</kwd><kwd>cochlea</kwd></kwd-group><kwd-group kwd-group-type="research-organism"><title>Research organism</title><kwd>Rat</kwd><kwd>Other</kwd></kwd-group><funding-group><award-group id="fund1"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000011</institution-id><institution>Howard Hughes Medical Institute</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Hudspeth</surname><given-names>AJ</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund2"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100004440</institution-id><institution>Wellcome Trust</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>108034/Z/15/Z</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Kozlov</surname><given-names>Andrei S</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund3"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100004440</institution-id><institution>Wellcome Trust</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>214234/Z/18/Z</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Kozlov</surname><given-names>Andrei S</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><funding-statement>The funders had no role in study design, data collection and interpretation, or the decision to submit the work for publication.</funding-statement></funding-group><custom-meta-group><custom-meta specific-use="meta-only"><meta-name>Author impact statement</meta-name><meta-value>A new method is described to apply rapid and uniform mechanical forces to vestibular and cochlear hair cells.</meta-value></custom-meta></custom-meta-group></article-meta></front><body><sec id="s1" sec-type="intro"><title>Introduction</title><p>Hair cells in the auditory and vestibular systems of vertebrates convert mechanical stimuli into electrical signals through the process of mechanoelectrical transduction (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Fettiplace and Kim, 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">Martin and Hudspeth, 2021</xref>). The mechanical receptor for such stimuli is the hair bundle, a cluster of stereocilia, or stiff enlarged microvilli, atop each hair cell. An extracellular molecular filament, the tip link, extends from the tip of each stereocilium to the side of its tallest neighbor in the plane parallel to the bundle's axis of symmetry. Mechanically gated ion channels are located at the lower end of each tip link. When a hair bundle pivots at its base toward its tall edge in response to stimulation, the increased tension in the tip links opens the ion channels and the ensuing ionic current depolarizes the cell (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1A</xref>).</p><fig id="fig1" position="float"><label>Figure 1.</label><caption><title>Structure of the hair bundle and configuration of the experiments.</title><p>(<bold>A</bold>) A schematic illustration portrays a hair bundle, in this instance that from the bullfrog’s sacculus, at rest (left) and when deflected towards its tall edge (right). The bundle is formed by rows of stereocilia that increase in height along the axis of sensitivity and are interlinked by molecular filaments, the tip links, that stretch as the bundle moves forward. The tip links project the stimulus force onto mechanosensitive ion channels. (<bold>B</bold>) A tapered optical fiber with a spherical lens at its tip is brought within a few tens of micrometers of a hair bundle. The fiber's angle of approximately 20 from the horizontal allows it to pass beneath the microscope’s objective lens without impinging upon other nearby hair bundles. An image of the hair bundle is projected through the microscope and onto a dual photodiode, which permits measurement of bundle motion with a precision in the nanometer range. Note that the extent of hair-bundle movement in this and the subsequent figures is greatly exaggerated for didactic purposes: the largest displacements move the bundle’s top by less than the diameter of a single stereocilium.</p></caption><graphic mime-subtype="tiff" mimetype="image" xlink:href="elife-65930-fig1-v2.tif"/></fig><p>Although our understanding of the transduction process has improved significantly through the development of methods to mechanically stimulate a hair bundle, the techniques now available pose serious limitations. Two methods are commonly used to apply force to a hair bundle. The first is to deflect the bundle with a compliant glass fiber about 100 μm in length and 1 nm in diameter (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Crawford and Fettiplace, 1985</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Howard and Ashmore, 1986</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Howard and Hudspeth, 1988</xref>). The fiber's tip is attached to the top of the hair bundle and its base is driven by a piezoelectric actuator. Because the preparation is immersed in an aqueous solution, however, the fiber is subjected to hydrodynamic drag that roughly doubles that on the bundle. For a typical fiber of stiffness 500 μN•m<sup>–1</sup> and drag coefficient 150 nN•s•m<sup>–1</sup>, the time constant of responsiveness is about 300 μs, which corresponds to a low-pass filter with a cutoff frequency near 500 Hz (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Crawford and Fettiplace, 1985</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Howard and Hudspeth, 1987</xref>). Another problem is especially acute for the stimulation of mammalian hair bundles, whose stereocilia are less cohesive than those of amphibians: when a fiber is attached at a single site in the hair bundle, the displacement of other stereocilia depends in a complex manner on elastic and hydrodynamic coupling across the bundle. This arrangement results in an uneven application of force to different stereocilia and can produce artifacts (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Indzhykulian et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">Nam et al., 2015</xref>).</p><p>The second common method of stimulation uses a fluid jet that displaces a hair bundle through the action of a piezoelectric diaphragm (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Géléoc et al., 1997</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Corns et al., 2014</xref>). Although the resonant frequency of fluid injection can reach 5 kHz, practical use of the method is limited to less than 1 kHz owing to uncertainties in force calibration (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Dinklo et al., 2007</xref>). Moreover, fluid leakage from the system might introduce a displacement bias.</p><p>In summary, the inability of current methods to reach higher frequencies by direct stimulation limits our quantitative understanding of hair-cell mechanics over more than 95% of the range of mammalian hearing, which extends to 20 kHz in humans and at least 150 kHz in some species of bats and whales. What is more, the susceptibility of current approaches to artifacts has long impeded our understanding of hearing, in particular in the case of the mammalian ear (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">Nam et al., 2015</xref>).</p><p>To address these problems, we used laser irradiation to stimulate hair bundles (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1</xref>). Because photonic force arises when photons are absorbed, reflected, or refracted upon interaction with an object, intense illumination should apply substantial force to a bundle. Our experiments confirmed the validity of the approach and demonstrated that the requisite irradiation does not jeopardize a bundle’s operation. This method allows us to probe hair-bundle physiology at previously inaccessible timescales, for the delivery time of the stimulus can accommodate the full frequency range of mammalian hearing. At the same time, this approach avoids the artifacts that bedevil current methods.</p></sec><sec id="s2" sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><sec id="s2-1"><title>Application of photonic force to a hair bundle</title><p>The conservation of momentum entails that reflected, absorbed, and refracted photons exert force on a target. All these phenomena are likely to take place when light strikes an array of stereocilia in a hair bundle. Although an analysis based on reflection alone would indicate that a hair bundle is relatively insensitive to radiation pressure, geometric considerations reveal that multiple modes of light propagation occur in a hair bundle by virtue of the cylindrical shape of the stereocilia (see Materials and methods). Each of these modes is capable of transferring momentum and therefore of mechanically stimulating the bundle. Because the diameter of each stereocilium compares to the wavelength of light, the regular spacing of stereocilia within the hair bundle might additionally give rise to complex interference effects.</p><sec id="s2-1-1"><title>Structure and orientation of an optical fiber</title><p>Geometrical factors are important in the stimulation of a hair bundle through an optical fiber. With its external plastic jacket, an intact fiber can be several millimeters in diameter. Even after the jacket has been removed, the core of the fiber—which is only 5 μm in diameter—lies within a cylinder of glass cladding about 125 μm across. In order to bring the fiber’s core near a hair bundle without impingement of the fiber’s outer layers on the experimental preparation, it was necessary to strip the jacket and taper the cladding. By melting the tip of the fiber’s core, we created a hemispherical lens with a divergence angle in water of approximately 11° (see Materials and methods).</p><p>It was next desirable for the light beam to stimulate only a single hair bundle without affecting others nearby. This objective could be achieved readily for a flat sensory epithelium such as that of the bullfrog’s sacculus, in which the bundles are about 8 μm tall and are separated by approximately 15 μm (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1</xref>). In the rat’s cochlea, however, the distance between the row of inner hair cells and the first row of outer hair cells is only 10 μm, and successive rows of outer hair cells are still more closely apposed. Moreover, this preparation is complicated by the complex curvature of its apical surface, the reticular lamina, which allows greater clearance for an optical fiber in some orientations than in others. After securing the end of a tapered optical fiber in a stable holder, we found that introducing it beneath the objective lens at an angle of 20° from the horizontal allowed the tip to approach a target hair bundle closely enough—typically about 7 μm—to ensure efficient stimulation, and at the same time positioned the tip far enough above other bundles to avoid damaging them (see Materials and methods).</p></sec><sec id="s2-1-2"><title>Deflection of glass rods by photonic force</title><p>Before engaging in experiments with hair bundles, we conducted control experiments to confirm that photonic force from a tapered optical fiber could move an object of stiffness comparable to that of a bundle. We thinned two glass rods with a pipette puller and measured the stiffness of each by analyzing the spectrum of its Brownian motion and applying the equipartition theorem. After positioning each rod such that its shadow projected onto the photodiode, we delivered light pulses through a tapered optical fiber positioned approximately 10 µm from the rod's tip. In both cases, we found that irradiation elicited a prompt movement in the expected direction (see <xref ref-type="fig" rid="app1fig1">Appendix 1—figure 1A</xref>). Having ascertained that our setup could deliver forces of an appropriate order of magnitude, we commenced experiments on living hair bundles.</p></sec></sec><sec id="s2-2"><title>Stimulation of frog hair bundles</title><p>We stimulated 40 hair bundles of the bullfrog’s sacculus so that radiation pressure would push them toward their tall edges—the positive direction—and reliably elicited the expected movements (see <xref ref-type="fig" rid="app1fig1">Appendix 1—figure 1A</xref>). The bundles followed similar trajectories at the onset of irradiation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2</xref>): the movement was approximately exponential with a time constant of <inline-formula><mml:math id="inf1"><mml:mrow><mml:mn>0.64</mml:mn><mml:mo>±</mml:mo><mml:mrow><mml:mpadded width="+1.7pt"><mml:mn>0.06</mml:mn></mml:mpadded><mml:mo>⁢</mml:mo><mml:mi>ms</mml:mi></mml:mrow></mml:mrow></mml:math></inline-formula> (mean ± SEM, N = 16). The responses, which reached displacements as great as 500 nm, encompassed the range of complex trajectories reported in the literature (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Benser et al., 1996</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib40">Tobin et al., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">Ricci et al., 2000</xref>). The more compliant hair bundles—those displaying initial deflections exceeding about 150 nm—displayed relatively slow movements in the direction of the photonic force, a signature of the timescale of the adaptation process that allows hair cells to reset their operating points and thus detect successive stimuli (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2A</xref>, gray arrows) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Howard and Hudspeth, 1987</xref>). The twitch, a faster rebound of the hair bundle in a direction opposite to that of the stimulus, is another manifestation of the adaptation process that occurs instead in response to smaller movements of the hair bundle and whose magnitude decreases for larger deflections (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Benser et al., 1996</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">Ricci et al., 2000</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Cheung and Corey, 2006</xref>). The twitch was indeed observed in stiffer bundles with deflections of about 50 nm (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2B–C</xref>). These results indicate that photonic force is an effective means of stimulating hair bundles.</p><fig id="fig2" position="float"><label>Figure 2.</label><caption><title>Responses of hair bundles from the bullfrog’s sacculus.</title><p>(<bold>A</bold>) Although all hair bundles displayed rapid movements at the onset and conclusion of photonic stimulation, some exhibited relatively slow approaches to their peaks and slow relaxations. Eleven hair bundles were stimulated in the positive direction with 561 nm light with 30 mW at the fiber’s entrance, or about 15 mW at the fiber’s output; each trace is the average of 25 responses.

After rupturing the tip links, we imaged a hair bundle on the dual photodiode and aligned the plane of polarization with the long axis of the stereocilia. We then rotated a half-wave plate through 90° in 10° increments. The light-induced deflection declined monotonically to an angle of 40°-50°, but remained roughly constant thereafter (see <xref ref-type="fig" rid="app1fig3">Appendix 1—figure 3</xref>). That the response did not decline as the cosine of the angle likely reflected the fact that stereocilia are not parallel, evenly spaced cylinders but rather a more complex array with varying tilts and separations. This result nonetheless emphasized the importance of attending to the beam’s polarization, which was held parallel with the hair bundles’ long axes in subsequent experiments.</p></sec></sec><sec id="s2-3"><title>Stimulation of rat hair bundles</title><p>We applied photonic stimuli to the hair bundles of both inner and outer hair cells from the cochleas of young rats. Consistent with previous evidence that mammalian hair bundles are stiffer than their amphibian counterparts (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib40">Tobin et al., 2019</xref>), the recorded amplitudes of deflection were typically smaller (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3A–D</xref>). The time constants for the initial displacements were again a few hundred microseconds. To characterize the efficacy of photonic stimulation for rat hair bundles, we applied positive stimuli to 22 outer hair cells from three preparations. We deflected 13 hair bundles with amplitudes varying from 25 nm to 35 nm. We also deflected seven of nine bundles from inner hair cells; the response amplitudes varied from 100 nm to 75 nm and the trajectories resembled those from the frog.</p><fig id="fig3" position="float"><label>Figure 3.</label><caption><title>Responses of hair bundles from the rat’s cochlea.</title><p>(<bold>A</bold>) Irradiation of the hair bundle from an inner hair cell evoked motion in the direction of light propagation, here the positive direction, with a time constant of 459 μs.

When we disrupted the tip links with BAPTA to abolish the photothermal effect, we observed that both positive and negative stimuli evoked rapid movements in the direction of light propagation (see <xref ref-type="fig" rid="app1fig5">Appendix 1—figure 5</xref>). We also stimulated hair bundles along a direction perpendicular to their axis of symmetry and again found that they moved in the direction of photon flux (see <xref ref-type="fig" rid="app1fig5">Appendix 1—figure 5C</xref>). These results indicate that bundle motion upon photonic stimulation can occur in the absence of a photothermal effect: bundle movements stem solely from optical radiation force.</p><p>In a frog’s hair cell, the photothermal effect apparently results from light absorption by the mitochondria that accumulate around the cuticular plate at the cell’s apical surface (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Azimzadeh et al., 2018</xref>). Because in mammalian outer hair cells mitochondria are instead concentrated at the lateral plasma membrane (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Fuchs, 2010</xref>), it was possible to isolate the photothermal effect by directing light well below the apical cell surface. Note that the photothermal movement was relatively slow: its time constant of 2 ms was about ten times that of the movements owing to photonic force. Conversely, it was possible to avert the photothermal effect by irradiating a mammalian hair bundle with intact tip links while avoiding irradiation of the cell body.</p></sec><sec id="s2-6"><title>Survival of mechanotransduction after laser irradiation</title><p>The hair bundles of healthy hair cells from the bullfrog can oscillate back-and-forth even in the absence of external stimulation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Martin et al., 2003</xref>). These spontaneous oscillations are a manifestation of the active process that these cells employ to amplify mechanical stimuli by counteracting viscous damping. The presence of spontaneous oscillations, which require a fully functional transduction apparatus, offers a means of assessing the viability of hair cells and the preservation of mechanotransduction following exposure to laser irradiation.</p><p>We compared the spontaneous oscillations of six hair cells before and after subjecting them to 25 pulses of light. Even at laser powers sufficient to deflect hair bundles over their entire physiological range of motion, the amplitudes and frequencies of the bundles' oscillation were unaffected by laser irradiation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5</xref>).

The fluorescence signal from laser-irradiated hair bundles showed no visible difference with respect to that of the unscathed cells, whereas mechanically damaged bundles were visibly dimmer. This diminished fluorescence likely resulted from breakage of the tip links that reduced the opening of the mechanotransduction channels, thereby limiting the intake of the dye.</p></sec></sec><sec id="s3" sec-type="discussion"><title>Discussion</title><p>We have used tapered optical fibers to apply both rapid and prolonged forces to individual hair bundles. The tip of each tapered fiber was small enough to be positioned near a hair bundle, and the ball lens at its tip restricted the divergence of the emitted light beam. Irradiation could be confined to a single bundle, whereupon the uniform illumination of all the stereocilia implied that each experienced a similar photonic force. It was also possible to irradiate only a portion of a bundle. Our control experiments indicated that even extensive irradiation of the magnitude necessary to evoke large displacements did not harm the hair bundles.</p><p>There are two difficulties with photonic stimulation. Although a routine procedure after the assembly of the necessary facilities, fabrication of a tapered optical fiber requires specialized equipment and a safe environment for the use of etching solution. A second issue is calibration: unlike the force delivered by a flexible fiber, which can be calibrated through the fiber's Brownian motion, the force exerted by photonic stimulation is not easily measured. The force can nonetheless be estimated by the use of targets whose stiffness has been independently determined, especially glass fibers such as those used in this study, or passive hair bundles including those subjected to chemical fixation.</p><p>The use of photonic stimulation offers at least five advantages over the currently used methods of mechanical stimulation. First, stimulation is rapid: in the present study, the rise time of mechanical responses was set by a hair bundle’s stiffness and drag coefficient, without any effect of the drag on a stimulus fiber or the inertia of a piezoelectric actuator. Second, stimulation could be made still more rapid by a process analogous to 'supercharging’ in a voltage-clamp system (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Armstrong and Chow, 1987</xref>): transient irradiation with a very bright light could be used to deflect a bundle to a desired position, after which a steady force would be applied by weaker illumination during the measurement of a response. Because illumination can be switched off, a third virtue is that there is no possibility of an ill-defined steady-state offset in bundle position owing to mispositioning of a fiber or leakage from a fluid jet. The uniform illumination of the stereocilia in a bundle offers a fourth advantage, especially for mammalian hair bundles that exhibit relatively poor lateral coupling between stereocilia. And finally, photonic stimulation can be used in spaces too restricted to admit a flexible fiber or fluid jet. In particular, it should be possible to stimulate one or several hair bundles in preparations such as a hemicochlea (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">He et al., 2004</xref>) or an isolated cochlear segment (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Chan and Hudspeth, 2005a</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Chan and Hudspeth, 2005b</xref>).</p></sec><sec id="s4" sec-type="materials|methods"><title>Materials and methods</title><sec id="s4-1"><title>Estimation of photonic force</title><p>Each absorbed photon imparts all of its original momentum to the absorbing object and thereby provides an impulsive force.

Various methods have been employed to reduce the diameter of fibers in near-field optical microscopy and in the development of optical-fiber sensors. One common method is to use a carbon dioxide laser to machine optical fibers (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">Ozcan et al., 2007</xref>).

Although both methods are effective, they are time-consuming and require expensive instruments.</p><p>On the basis of previous experiments with glass fibers, we suspected that the interaction of tapered fibers with living specimens would contaminate the fibers’ tips and thus limit the use of each fiber to only a few experiments. Furthermore, the gradual degradation due to several hundred high-power optical pulses during an experiment would limit a fiber’s use to a few experiments. Both considerations required that fibers be tapered easily and cost-effectively in a typical laboratory setting. We created tapered optical fibers by Turner's wet chemical etching with hydrofluoric acid (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">André et al., 2014</xref>). With this method, a fiber can be shaped in about 1.5 hr in any laboratory with a fume hood and few tools.

After 47.5 mL of concentrated (48%) hydrofluoric acid had been placed in a polypropylene tube (Corning Life Sciences, Tewksbury, MA, USA), 2.5 mL of red kerosene oil was added. The oil layer's purpose was twofold. First, it provided protection to the fiber above the surface from attack by acid vapor. Second, the height of the aqueous meniscus was dependent upon the diameter of the immersed fiber, and thus declined as etching proceeded. When etching was complete, the oil layer isolated the tip from the acid.</p><fig id="fig8" position="float"><label>Figure 8.</label><caption><title>Preparation of a tapered optical fiber.</title><p>(<bold>A</bold>) A schematic diagram depicts the process of reducing the optical fiber's diameter by chemical etching.

The initial program inserted the fiber 10 mm into the acid at 2 mm•s<sup>–1</sup> and extracted 8mm at the same speed. The routine next extracted the optical fiber for 20 min at 37.5 μm•min<sup>–1</sup>, reducing its diameter from 125 μm to 60 μm. The extraction then stopped and the fiber remained in the acid for 18 min, during which tip was etched at a steeper angle by the gradual fall of the meniscus.

Using a pair of manual manipulators, we mounted the torch below the fiber’s tip and visualized them with a horizontal microscope.

The authors address this unmet need with development and characterization of a light-based stimulus to generate rapid photonic force capable of deflecting a range of hair bundle geometries, including amphibian and mammalian vestibular and auditory hair bundles. The manuscript conveys a message that will be of use for the wide community of researchers working on mechanosensory integration and more broadly for engineers and scientists interested in using light to generate force. The study is extremely elegant, well written with beautiful illustrations. This work will be without a doubt a great addition to the field.</p><p><bold>Decision letter after peer review:</bold></p><p>Thank you for submitting your article &quot;Rapid mechanical stimulation of inner-ear hair cells by photonic pressure&quot; for consideration by <italic>eLife</italic>. Your article has been reviewed by 3 peer reviewers, including Fred Rieke as the Reviewing Editor and Reviewer #1, and the evaluation has been overseen by a Richard Aldrich as the Senior Editor. The following individual involved in review of your submission has agreed to reveal their identity: Claire Wyart (Reviewer #3).</p><p>The reviewers have discussed their reviews with one another, and the Reviewing Editor has drafted this to help you prepare a revised submission.</p><p>As you will see, the reviewers were all enthusiastic about the approach you describe, but had some substantial concerns that need to be dealt with. In consultation, all three reviewers agreed about the importance of these points. First, additional evidence (beyond the spontaneous bundle movements) that the hair cells are viable after photonic stimulation is needed. Second, analysis of the robustness of the approach – i.e. how variable is it across cells and over time – is needed to evaluate potential applications. Third, the set of stimuli probed in the paper is quite limited. A better understanding of the range of stimuli that can be used is important for evaluating how useful the approach will be. These and some additional points are detailed in the individual reviews below.</p><p>Essential revisions:</p><p><italic>Reviewer #1 (Recommendations for the authors):</italic></p><p>The limitations of the approach could be included in the last paragraph of the introduction.

The authors address this unmet need with development and characterization of a light-based stimulus to generate rapid photonic force capable of deflecting a range of hair bundle geometries, including amphibian and mammalian vestibular and auditory hair bundles. The writing is straightforward and easy to follow and figures are beautifully illustrated and informative. There are several shortcomings, attention to which, could further improve the manuscript and utility of the photonic stimulation method.</p><p>1) While the manuscript provides a significant technical advance, the end result does not necessarily inspire confidence that it can be widely implemented. For example, to be useful, the stimulator would need to provide a range of stimulus amplitudes to a single hair bundle. Likewise, a range of stimulus waveforms, steps, sinewaves of various frequencies, etc, would enhance the broad utility of the approach. Since the introduction section highlights the short comings of current hair bundle stimulation methods, it would also be of value for the results/Discussion section address whether the current photonic stimulation method has overcome those shortcomings or whether further technical development will be needed.</p><p>2) In general, the Results section is loosely quantified. For example, Figure 2A demonstrates significant cell-to-cell variability in the amplitude of the motion. What is the source of that variability? Biological variability in hair bundle stiffness, or variability in stimulus, probe position, light intensity, etc. Furthermore, what is the trial-to-trial variability for a single hair bundle? Figure 2 legend states each trace in panel 2A is an average of 25 responses, thus some representation of trial-to-trial variability could be quantified and presented. This would add value and provide the reader with a better sense of stimulus reproducibility.</p><p>3) A technical concern needs to be addressed to reassure readers that the photodiode signal is an accurate representation of hair bundle position. This has been well established in prior publications, but needs to be revisited here, either with additional experimentation or a sufficiently persuasive explanation. The concern is, since the stimulus is light itself and the response (bundle position) depends on a measurement of light signal, the stimulus could contaminate measurement of the response. This issue needs to be addressed in the Results section. If it’s buried in the methods section, I missed it, so please clarify.</p><p>4) The section entitled &quot;Survival of mechanotransduction after laser irradiation&quot; is important but somewhat unfulfilling. Measurement of spontaneous bundle motion is just one measure of intact mechanotransduction. It would be reassuring to know that other measures are also intact following hair bundle irradiation. Recordings of hair cell transduction current or receptor potentials, uptake of FM1-43, etc. could provide more direct evidence.</p><p>Line 112: References needed for &quot;reported in the literature&quot;.</p><p>Line 125: How were tip links ruptured? Please clarify. Line 140: Stimuli were applied to 22 out har cells, but 13 bundles were defected? What happened to the other 9? No defection was evoked? Please clarify and explain.</p><p><italic>Reviewer #3 (Recommendations for the authors):</italic></p><p>There are only small modifications to be made to the manuscript in order to better characterize the variability of the responses induced in the hair bundle, a discussion on how the method could be used and validated in mammalian hair cells and a request to provide additional paths to check the viability of the cells and the robustness of the mechanosensory response after multiple optical stimulations have been performed.</p><p>1. The variability of the displacement to the 25 stimulations at 30mW @561nm in Figure 2A should be added as standard deviation (as a shade of light color) on top of the average depicted here. The variability in displacement for the rising as well as for the relaxation in B should also be depicted across stimulations for one cell and across cells.</p><p>Same indication of variability across trials and cells should apply for other figures where the average of 25 stimulations is depicted.</p><p>2. The authors make a point that mechanical stimulations are too slow to match the optimal frequency of activation of mammalian hair cells. However, if there is such variability in amplitude &amp; kinetics of the displacement induced by the photonic force through the optic fiber, how can this technique be calibrated in small mammalian hair bundles?</p><p>3. The authors should check the viability of the cells and the robustness of the mechanosensory response after multiple optical stimulations have been performed. Currently they compare the spontaneous oscillations before and after a stimulation to illustrate that the method is not disrupting the function of the hair cell. However spontaneous oscillations are not visible on all cells. Are there other means (calcium imaging? electrophysiology?) by which the author could illustrate that the technique is not damaging the cell and altering the mechanosensory response in the hair bundle?</p></body></sub-article><sub-article article-type="reply" id="sa2"><front-stub><article-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.65930.sa2</article-id><title-group><article-title>Author response</article-title></title-group></front-stub><body><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>As you will see below, the reviewers were all enthusiastic about the approach you describe, but had some substantial concerns that need to be dealt with.

We have added a new section entitled “Variety of stimuli”:</p><p>“The fiber's power delivered onto a hair bundle can be modulated by changing the laser's power at the source. By combining analog and digital signals to drive the laser's output, we were able to stimulate hair bundles with an assortment of stimuli: sine waves, frequency sweeps, step pulses of various magnitudes, and continuously ascending and descending ramps (see Appendix 1, Figure 4). The responses of bullfrog's hair bundles to sinusoidal frequency sweeps at frequencies up to 2 kHz (Figure 4). In this case the upper boundary in the stimulus frequency was set by the ability of the hair bundle to follow, rather than by the limitations of the stimulation method.”</p><p>The caption of the new Figure 4 reads:</p><p>“Responses of hair bundles from the bullfrog's sacculus to sinusoidal frequency sweeps between 10 Hz and 200 Hz (A), 100 Hz and 500 Hz (B), and 1 kHz and 2 kHz (C). Each stimulus was achieved by driving the laser's source such that the amplitude of the sweep peaked at the maximum power output—12.5 mW for this fiber—while keeping its minimum above 0 mW. Each hair bundle was stimulated in the positive direction with 561 nm laser light; each trace is the average of 25 responses. Panel C portrays two 20 ms-long representative segments of the stimulus waveform, which would be unintelligible if displayed in full. These segments, located near the beginning and end of the sweep, are aligned with the magnification of the simultaneous hair-bundle response (red dashed boxes).</p><p>The caption of the new Figure 4 in Appendix 1 reads:</p><p>“Example of the variety of stimuli offered by photonic-force stimulation.

Recordings of hair cell transduction current or receptor potentials, uptake of FM1-43, etc. could provide more direct evidence.</p></disp-quote><p>The fact that hair bundles continued to oscillate spontaneously after irradiation means that not only the mechanotransduction apparatus was not damaged but, more subtly, that the hair bundles continued to reside in the same region of the phase space—meaning that the control parameter governing the transition to the oscillatory regime was not perturbed by irradiation. In Appendix 1—figure 6, we have now added results showing the persistent uptake of FM1-43 by hair bundles after extensive irradiation.</p><p>We have added a paragraph to the section “Survival of mechanotransduction after laser irradiation”:</p><p>“To further assess the health of the hair bundles exposed to laser irradiation, we compared their intake of FM1-43—a fluorescent dye that enters a hair cell through open mechanotransduction channels (Gale <italic>et al.</italic>, 2001)—with that of surrounding undisturbed hair cells and that of a mechanically damaged bundle (Appendix 1—figure 6). The fluorescence signal from laser-irradiated hair bundles showed no visible difference with respect to those of the unscathed cells, whereas mechanically damaged bundles were visibly dimmer. The diminished fluorescence likely resulted from breakage of tip links that reduced the opening of the mechanotransduction channels, thereby limiting the intake of the dye.”</p><p>The caption of the new Appendix 1—figure 6 reads:</p><p>“The fluorescence signal of bullfrog saccular hair bundles loaded with FM1-43 after exposure to laser irradiation. We stimulated successive hair bundles in a row with 50 ms pulses at a power of 12.5 mW, the full power available for the fiber. The five hair bundles in the green box were subjected to 10, 20, 30, 40, and 50 pulses, as indicated. A sixth hair bundle in the same row, labeled in red, was damaged by being crushed a few times by the end of the optical fiber. Immediately after those procedures, the sample was exposed to 1 mM of FM1-43 for one minute, after which fluorescence was recorded. The stimulated hair bundles show comparable levels of brightness between each other and with respect to those in the surroundings. The loading of the dye is visibly reduced in the mechanically damaged cell owing to breakage of the tip links.”</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Line 112: References needed for &quot;reported in the literature&quot;.</p></disp-quote><p>We have added references.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Line 125: How were tip links ruptured?

Please clarify and explain.</p></disp-quote><p>Although we are not sure why those nine hair bundles did not move, we note that the hair bundle of an outer hair cell forms a triangular prism that can produce forward scattering for oblique illumination. Forward scattering might create a negative force; indeed, this phenomenon has been exploited in optical tractor beams (Sukhov and Dogariu, Phys. Rev. Lett., 2011). This negative force will add to the positive force due to back scattering. The relative contribution of the two forces is in general a complex function of the object’s geometry and optical properties as well as of the beam’s profile and angle of incidence. It is therefore possible, and indeed expected, that some hair bundles move more than others in the direction of beam propagation.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Reviewer #3 (Recommendations for the authors):</p><p>There are only small modifications to be made to the manuscript in order to better characterize the variability of the responses induced in the hair bundle, a discussion on how the method could be used and validated in mammalian hair cells and a request to provide additional paths to check the viability of the cells and the robustness of the mechanosensory response after multiple optical stimulations have been performed.</p><p>1.

For each recording condition, the variability of responses across trials was always small. Because we measured displacements in the nanometer range, the principal purpose of repeated stimulation was to average away the noise owing to thermal agitation of the bundles and to photon shot noise in the photodiode system. Please also see our response to the related comment below.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>2. The authors make a point that mechanical stimulations are too slow to match the optimal frequency of activation of mammalian hair cells. However, if there is such variability in amplitude &amp; kinetics of the displacement induced by the photonic force through the optic fiber, how can this technique be calibrated in small mammalian hair bundles?</p></disp-quote><p>The variability is inevitable because the method applies force and not displacement. Therefore, the motion of each hair bundle is determined by its stiffness and drag coefficient (and, at higher frequencies, its mass). Because hair-bundle stiffness is known to vary – and can even become negative owing to the phenomenon of gating compliance –this variability is expected, and indeed a welcome indication of healthy bundles. Given the rich panoply of known active hair-bundle behaviors, it would indeed be strange if all hair bundles moved identically in response to a force step.</p><p>We discuss the issue of calibration at the end of the Discussion. In addition, we have added Figure 7 of Appendix 1, in which we determine the stiffness of an individual hair bundle with a calibrated glass fiber, then ascertain what photonic stimulus yields a similar deflection. Although in principle a bundle's stiffness can be also deduced from its Brownian motion, mammalian hair bundles are relatively stiff and it is difficult to measure their Brownian motion without laser interferometry.</p><p>Perhaps most importantly, one needs to know the stimulus force exactly when one wishes to measure hair-bundle stiffness accurately. But the stiffness of bundles is already well known; for example, hair bundles of outer hair cell have stiffness values that vary between about 1 mN·m<sup>–1</sup> and 4 mN·m<sup>–1</sup>. So if such a hair bundle – for example the one illustrated in Figure 3 – was deflected by 10 nm with photonic force, the associated force was 10–40 pN. The precise force is not critical in estimates of the time constant of hair-bundle deflection.</p><p>Finally, stiffness can be estimated by applying forces using slower traditional methods. Our method is designed to apply whatever force it takes to rapidly move a hair bundle by a desired and directly measured distance.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>3. The authors should check the viability of the cells and the robustness of the mechanosensory response after multiple optical stimulations have been performed. Currently they compare the spontaneous oscillations before and after a stimulation to illustrate that the method is not disrupting the function of the hair cell. However spontaneous oscillations are not visible on all cells. Are there other means (calcium imaging? electrophysiology?) by which the author could illustrate that the technique is not damaging the cell and altering the mechanosensory response in the hair bundle?</p></disp-quote><p>We concur with this suggestion, and have performed an additional control experiment.
