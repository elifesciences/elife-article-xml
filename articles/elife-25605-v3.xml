However, this ability is not shared by another teleost, the medaka. In order to identify cellular and molecular bases for this difference, we performed comparative transcriptomic analyses following cardiac cryoinjury. This comparison points to major differences in immune cell dynamics between these models. Upon closer examination, we observed delayed and reduced macrophage recruitment in medaka, along with delayed neutrophil clearance. To investigate the role of immune responses in cardiac regeneration, we delayed macrophage recruitment in zebrafish and observed compromised neovascularization, neutrophil clearance, cardiomyocyte proliferation and scar resolution. In contrast, stimulating Toll-like receptor signaling in medaka enhanced immune cell dynamics and promoted neovascularization, neutrophil clearance, cardiomyocyte proliferation and scar resolution. Altogether, these data provide further insight into the complex role of the immune response during regeneration, and serve as a platform to identify and test additional regulators of cardiac repair.</p><p><bold>DOI:</bold> <ext-link ext-link-type="doi" xlink:href="10.7554/eLife.25605.001">http://dx.doi.org/10.7554/eLife.25605.001</ext-link></p></abstract><kwd-group kwd-group-type="author-keywords"><title>Author Keywords</title><kwd>medaka</kwd><kwd>Oryzias latipes</kwd><kwd>zebrafish</kwd><kwd>Danio Rerio</kwd></kwd-group><kwd-group kwd-group-type="research-organism"><title>Research Organism</title><kwd>Zebrafish</kwd></kwd-group><funding-group><award-group id="par-1"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100004189</institution-id><institution>Max-Planck-Gesellschaft</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>Open-access funding</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Stainier</surname><given-names>Didier YR</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><funding-statement>The funder had no role in study design, data collection and interpretation, or the decision to submit the work for publication.</funding-statement></funding-group><custom-meta-group><custom-meta><meta-name>elife-xml-version</meta-name><meta-value>2.5</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta specific-use="meta-only"><meta-name>Author impact statement</meta-name><meta-value>Timely macrophage recruitment is essential for neovascularization and neutrophil clearance during cardiac regeneration.</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta><meta-name>eLife Digest</meta-name><meta-value>2.5</meta-value></custom-meta></custom-meta-group></article-meta></front><body><sec id="s1" sec-type="intro"><title>Introduction</title><p>Heart failure results from the inability of the human heart to replenish damaged tissue after myocardial infarction (MI), leading to an unresolved scar, tissue remodeling, and functional impairment. Unlike humans, many vertebrates, including certain fish and amphibians, are able to regenerate their heart (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib52">Vivien et al., 2016</xref>). Comparative analyses have been performed in many species to identify factors that may promote cardiac regeneration in humans (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib52">Vivien et al., 2016</xref>). These studies have revealed that regenerative capacity exists sparsely across the animal kingdom, and seems to correlate with low-metabolic state, poikilothermia, hypoxia, an immature cardiomyocyte (CM) structure, and an immature immune system (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib52">Vivien et al., 2016</xref>). As an example, zebrafish exhibit a remarkable regenerative capacity after different cardiac insults (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib44">Poss et al., 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">González-Rosa et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib48">Schnabel et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Chablais et al., 2011</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib54">Zhang et al., 2013</xref>). Upon cardiac injury, the zebrafish heart exhibits in turn, gene activation in epicardium and endocardium, neovascularization, proliferation of CMs, functional integration of new muscle cells, and replacement of scar tissue (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Kikuchi and Poss, 2012</xref>). However, the profound physiological differences between regenerative and non-regenerative model organisms often mask the informative data directly relevant to regeneration. Recently, another fresh water teleost, medaka (<italic>Oryzias latipes</italic>), has been reported to lack neovascularization or CM proliferation post cardiac injury, subsequently displaying excessive fibrosis and an unresolved scar (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Ito et al., 2014</xref>). Zebrafish and medaka share a living environment, similar physiological conditions, and anatomical structures (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Furutani-Seiki and Wittbrodt, 2004</xref>). In addition, orthologous genes between these two teleost species are easier to identify compared to more phylogenetically distant organisms, rendering them more suitable for direct comparisons (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Furutani-Seiki and Wittbrodt, 2004</xref>).</p><p>To identify factors that account for the differences in cardiac regenerative capacity between zebrafish and medaka, we performed detailed comparative transcriptomic analyses following cardiac injury. From these analyses, we observed that acute immune responses appear to be different between zebrafish and medaka. Tissue inflammation and immune cell recruitment/infiltration occur immediately following injury, and have been shown to be required for heart regeneration in zebrafish (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Huang et al., 2013a</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">de Preux Charles et al., 2016a</xref>) and neonatal mice (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">Lavine et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Aurora et al., 2014</xref>). In addition, the type of the immune response and profile of the immune cells recruited to the injury site can influence the extent of injury repair (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Godwin et al., 2017</xref>). However, the permissive and instructive roles of the various immune cell populations during heart regeneration remain largely unknown.</p><p>Consistent with the information from our transcriptomic analyses, we observed delayed and reduced macrophage recruitment in medaka compared to zebrafish following cardiac injury. Delaying macrophage recruitment in the normally regenerative zebrafish resulted in defective neovascularization and neutrophil clearance, decreased CM proliferation and unresolved scar. In contrast, injection of the Toll-like receptor agonist poly I:C into the non-regenerative medaka accelerated immune cell dynamics and promoted neovascularization, CM proliferation, and scar resolution. Altogether, these results highlight the role of an acute immune response and timely macrophage recruitment as key triggers of the cardiac regenerative machinery.</p></sec><sec id="s2" sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><sec id="s2-1"><title>Comparative transcriptomic analyses between zebrafish and medaka hearts post injury</title><p>To perform comparative transcriptomic analyses, we collected zebrafish and medaka ventricles at several time points following sham operation, cryoinjury, or without any operation (untouched), and pooled 4 ventricles per time point for RNA extraction (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1A</xref>).

However, distinct clusters where gene expression changes between the two species are highly dissimilar can be identified (marked in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1B</xref>). For example, clusters A1 and A2 include genes that are highly upregulated in zebrafish following injury, but display an attenuated response in medaka, while clusters B1 and B2 include genes that are highly upregulated following injury in medaka but not in zebrafish. In addition, we noticed more dynamic changes in gene expression in zebrafish at 6 hr post cryoinjury (hpci), suggesting that acute gene responses are more frequent in zebrafish when compared to medaka (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1B</xref>).</p><p>To visualize the major trends in gene expression changes, we conducted Principal Component Analysis (PCA) based on normalized counts of all genes expressed in untouched and cryoinjured fish (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1C</xref>). As expected, the samples were separated according to species in component 1 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1C</xref>). The gene expression changes after cryoinjury were temporally similar between zebrafish and medaka in component 2, yet less dynamic in medaka (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1C</xref>). This finding may imply that the response to cryoinjury in medaka, although muted, is globally comparable to that in zebrafish. Interestingly, while major trends in gene expression in zebrafish reversed back toward the untouched state after 2 days post cryoinjury (dpci), a similar reversion was not observed in medaka until 3 dpci (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1C</xref>). These results suggest that on a global scale, medaka respond to cardiac injury similarly to zebrafish, but the response in medaka appears to be less dynamic and delayed. To identify major responses to cardiac injury in both species, we generated datasets containing relative gene expression levels (log<sub>2</sub> fold changes) in cryoinjured hearts compared to untouched hearts, as well as sham-operated hearts compared to untouched hearts, at different time points (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD9-data">Supplementary file 1</xref>). Using gene ontology (GO) analysis, we found that DEGs were enriched for a number of biological processes including oxidative reduction, M phase and mitosis, metabolic/catabolic processes, immune system development, organ and heart development, DNA replication, response to stress/stimulus, response to hormone stimulus and stress response (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1D</xref>). These results highlight the major gene expression responses to cardiac injury in zebrafish and medaka.</p></sec><sec id="s2-2"><title>Acute inflammation and immune response are blunted in medaka hearts post injury</title><p>Next, we investigated differential responses over time between the two species using Sample Level Enrichment Analysis (SLEA). Major GO term categories containing differential responses between zebrafish and medaka include immune response, cell proliferation, angiogenesis, and other biological processes (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2</xref>, and a complete list in <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD10-data">Supplementary file 2</xref>). Concerning the immune response, zebrafish showed a stronger activation of genes involved in the complement system, macrophages, B cells, T cells, and phagocytosis, while medaka showed a stronger activation of genes related to neutrophil and monocyte chemotaxis (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2A</xref>). In addition, zebrafish showed a stronger and prolonged activation of genes involved in both cell proliferation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2B</xref>) and angiogenesis (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2C</xref>). Among other biological processes differentially regulated between these two species, we observed stronger activation of genes involved in ROS biosynthesis, hyaluronan metabolism and biosynthesis, blood coagulation, and lipid metabolism in medaka; and a more pronounced activation of genes involved in the response to steroid hormone, adenylate cyclase activity, and adrenergic receptor activity in zebrafish (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2D</xref>). Interestingly, some of the above-mentioned biological processes, especially the immune response, were also activated in sham-operated hearts compared to untouched hearts (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s1">Figure 2—figure supplement 1</xref>), although the magnitude and dynamics appeared different. For example, genes involved in complement or macrophage activation appear to peak in zebrafish hearts at three days post sham operation, as opposed to a gradual increase over time in injured zebrafish hearts. Accordingly, preconditioning following thoracotomies (similar to our sham operations) has been reported to boost regenerative programmmes in the adult zebrafish heart (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">de Preux Charles et al., 2016b</xref>). Comparing our data from sham-operated and untouched hearts further reveals the biological processes potentially involved in this preconditioning (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s1">Figure 2—figure supplement 1</xref>). Altogether, these results show a range of differential responses between zebrafish and medaka following cardiac injury.<fig-group><fig id="fig2" position="float"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.25605.003</object-id><label>Figure 2.</label><caption><title>Heatmaps of differentially enriched GO terms from SLEA.</title><p>GO terms from SLEA analysis of cryoinjured vs. untouched hearts related to immune response (<bold>A</bold>), cell proliferation (<bold>B</bold>), angiogenesis (<bold>C</bold>) and other biological processes (<bold>D</bold>), were selected and respective Z-scores visualized.

We identified several immune-related pathways, including phagocytosis, NF-kB, PI3K/AKT, NFAT, and Toll-like receptor signaling (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD11-data">Supplementary file 3</xref>), that were upregulated in zebrafish. In addition, we found several pathways previously implicated in heart regeneration such as HIPPO (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Heallen et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib53">Xin et al., 2013</xref>), Neuregulin/ErbB (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Bersell et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Gemberling et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">D'Uva et al., 2015</xref>), Notch (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib45">Raya et al., 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib55">Zhao et al., 2014</xref>), and Telomerase activity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Bednarek et al., 2015</xref>)(<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD11-data">Supplementary file 3</xref>). Analysis of upstream regulators revealed that both poly I:C and CpG ODNs, two TLR agonists, are major upstream regulators of zebrafish responses compared to medaka responses (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD11-data">Supplementary file 3</xref>). Factors related to TLR signaling including interferon gamma (IFNG) and transforming growth factor beta (TGFB) were also identified (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD11-data">Supplementary file 3</xref>). TLRs sense various damage-associated molecular patterns (DAMPs) released by damaged tissues, inducing immune responses via activation of downstream genes, including inflammatory cytokines such as IFN, IL1, and TNF, as well as other inflammatory mediators (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Goulopoulou et al., 2016</xref>). Other upstream regulators on the list such as TGFB1 and IGF1 have been reported to positively regulate heart regeneration in zebrafish (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Chablais and Jazwinska, 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Huang et al., 2013b</xref>), while factors such as RET, MITF, miR-125b and miR101 are potentially interesting candidates for future studies, as their roles in heart regeneration have not yet been examined (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD11-data">Supplementary file 3</xref>). These results reveal the power of our approach to identify and provide some insight into molecules and pathways whose roles in promoting heart regeneration are largely unknown.</p></sec><sec id="s2-3"><title>Macrophage recruitment in medaka heart post injury is delayed and reduced compared to zebrafish</title><p>In view of our transcriptomic analyses, we hypothesized that a vigorous and acute immune response is instrumental to promote heart regeneration, while a muted response in medaka may hinder regeneration. Upon tissue damage, innate immune cells detect and respond to DAMPs released at the injury site partly through TLR signaling. Thus, we first examined and compared leukocyte recruitment in zebrafish and medaka hearts at different time points post injury (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3</xref>). For direct comparison, we utilized isolectin-B4 (IB4) and a myeloid-specific peroxidase (Mpx) antibody to label macrophages and neutrophils respectively in both organisms. IB4 labels macrophages in embryonic mouse tissues and adult hearts post infarction (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">Maddox et al., 1982</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib49">Sorokin and Hoyt, 1992</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib50">Sorokin et al., 1994</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Ismail et al., 2003</xref>).

Taken together, these data suggest that harnessing the acute immune response through TLR signaling activation can promote heart regeneration by accelerating macrophage recruitment, neutrophil clearance, neovascularization, CM proliferation and scar resolution in a species that normally does not regenerate its heart.<fig id="fig8" position="float"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.25605.019</object-id><label>Figure 8.</label><caption><title>Poly I:C injection in medaka promotes CM proliferation in a macrophage-dependent manner following cardiac injury.</title><p>Adult <italic>zfmlc2 5.1 k:DsRED2-nuc</italic> medaka were injected with PBS or poly I:C immediately after injury, or with clodronate liposomes at 1 day before injury and poly I:C immediately after injury.

Medaka share characteristics with species that can regenerate their hearts, including low-metabolic state, poikilothermia, hypoxia, an immature CM structure, and an immature immune system, yet are incapable of heart regeneration (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Ito et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib52">Vivien et al., 2016</xref>). In particular, activation of epicardial and endocardial signals, neovascularization, CM proliferation, or scar resolution were not observed in medaka after cardiac resection (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Ito et al., 2014</xref>). Here we report a comparative transcriptomic study of the responses to cardiac cryoinjury in zebrafish and medaka. Taking advantage of the well-annotated genomes of zebrafish and medaka, and a homology-based gene mapping technique, we generated a detailed dataset containing more than 15000 genes orthologous between these species, covering multiple time points in the first week following injury. Enrichment analyses based on this dataset revealed important biological processes and signaling pathways differentially regulated between zebrafish and medaka following cardiac injury. Previous attempts to compare responses in regenerative models, such as zebrafish, vs. non-regenerative models, such as adult mice, have been hindered by challenges to assign gene orthology, as well as basic physiological differences.</p><p>Here, we identified key processes such as the immune response, angiogenesis and cell proliferation that were delayed in medaka when compared to zebrafish. These data indicate that early responses to injury may play a key role in modulating subsequent events required for regeneration. Specifically, we observed that phagocytosis, as well as NF-kB, PI3K/AKT, NFAT, and TLR signaling pathways are blunted in their response following cardiac injury in medaka when compared to zebrafish. The presence in our datasets of pathways and signaling molecules previously implicated in heart regeneration further supports the power of our strategy to identify key regulators. Altogether, these results provide new insights into mechanisms underlying cardiac regeneration, as well as a new platform to investigate new candidate genes and pathways.</p></sec><sec id="s3-2"><title>Timely macrophage recruitment following injury is crucial for heart regeneration</title><p>Recently, we reported that fast angiogenic revascularization is a key process during heart regeneration (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib40">Marín-Juez et al., 2016</xref>), underscoring the importance of an efficient coordination of the early events following injury. In that study, angiogenic sprouting was blocked by overexpressing <italic>dn-vegfaa</italic> in the first days following injury, and it failed to occur subsequently (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib40">Marín-Juez et al., 2016</xref>). Here, we observed that a transient delay in macrophage recruitment at the time of injury also compromised neovascularization and heart regeneration. Previous studies investigating the role of macrophages during heart regeneration were performed by prolonged administration of CL (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Aurora et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">de Preux Charles et al., 2016a</xref>), potentially interfering with the many different processes taking place during injury resolution. To assess the importance of the precise synchronization of the early events following injury, we found that early interference with macrophage recruitment was sufficient to disrupt neovascularization, neutrophil clearance, and heart regeneration. In a mouse MI model, CMs secrete REG3ß to recruit macrophages post injury, and the loss of REG3β causes a large decrease in macrophage numbers in the ischemic heart, accompanied by insufficient clearance of neutrophils and increased ventricular dilatation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">Lörchner et al., 2015</xref>). Similarly, we observed delayed and reduced macrophage recruitment as well as delayed neutrophil clearance in medaka hearts following injury. Altogether these observations from mice, zebrafish and medaka indicate that timely macrophage recruitment is required for cardiac regeneration.</p></sec><sec id="s3-3"><title>Poly I:C injection in medaka promotes heart regeneration</title><p>Delayed macrophage recruitment in zebrafish compromises heart regeneration, and macrophage recruitment is initiated and propagated at least in part through the recognition of DAMPs by TLRs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Grote et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Goulopoulou et al., 2016</xref>). Thus, we tested whether enhanced TLR signaling via poly I:C injections would promote macrophage recruitment and heart regeneration in the non-regenerative medaka. Neovascularization of the injured area in zebrafish is one of the first processes that occurs following injury, accomplished by angiogenic sprouting from existing coronaries, with potential contributions from epicardial-derived cells, and under the regulation of a group of growth factors including FGF, PDGF and VEGF (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Kim et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Kikuchi et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib40">Marín-Juez et al., 2016</xref>). Unlike zebrafish, medaka do not have distinct coronaries, and, instead, develop a coronary-like structure with interdigitating endocardial extensions that penetrate the compact myocardium (healthy side in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7A’</xref>) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Lemanski et al., 1975</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Grimes et al., 2010</xref>). This observation led to the suggestion that following cardiac injury, medaka lack neovascularization from epicardium-derived or other cell populations (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Lemanski et al., 1975</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Ito et al., 2014</xref>). In contrast, we show here that medaka heart grows new vessel-like structures that have connected to the preexisting plexus in the injured area by 14 dpci (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7D and D’</xref>), a process that occurs much more slowly than the corresponding one in zebrafish (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib40">Marín-Juez et al., 2016</xref>). Still, these vessels appear to be unstable and are incapable of supporting regeneration.</p><p>Strikingly, we found that injections of poly I:C, a mimic of dsRNA and a TLR agonist, promote macrophage recruitment, faster and more stable neovascularization, increased CM proliferation, and scar resolution in medaka. TLR-mediated angiogenesis (or inflammation-induced angiogenesis) has been described in chronic inflammatory disorders, cardiovascular diseases, and cancer (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Grote et al., 2011</xref>). TLR signaling could potentially trigger angiogenesis in two different ways. TLR activation in macrophages could stimulate VEGF expression and secretion, and consequently induce endothelial cell migration and angiogenesis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib41">Meda et al., 2012</xref>). Similarly, TLR activation in endothelial cells could stimulate VEGF expression and cell proliferation, migration and tube formation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Hu et al., 2016</xref>). In addition, inflammatory signals have been proposed to prime CMs to dedifferentiate and proliferate in zebrafish (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">de Preux Charles et al., 2016b</xref>) as well as in neonatal mice (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Han et al., 2015</xref>). In this study, we found that promotion of vessel formation and CM proliferation by poly I:C injections seem to be mediated by macrophages, as pre-depletion of macrophages by CL injections blocked these processes. Nevertheless, it is likely that poly I:C has additional effects.</p><p>In summary, our results reveal the relationship between timely macrophage recruitment, neovascularization, and neutrophil clearance in injured hearts, and highlight the importance of acute immune activation in coordinating the early events during cardiac regeneration. Thus, harnessing the immune response through TLR signaling, or otherwise, could be part of therapeutic interventions to improve tissue repair post myocardial infarction or other injuries.</p></sec></sec><sec id="s4" sec-type="materials|methods"><title>Materials and methods</title><sec id="s4-1"><title>Zebrafish and medaka strains</title><p>All zebrafish and medaka husbandry was performed under standard conditions, and all animal experiments were done in accordance with institutional (MPG) and national ethical and animal welfare guidelines approved by the ethics committee for animal experiments at the Regierungspräsidium Darmstadt, Germany (permit numbers B2-1023 and B2-1111).

Your article has been reviewed by three peer reviewers and the evaluation has been overseen by a Reviewing Editor and Marianne Bronner as the Senior Editor. The following individual involved in review of your submission has agreed to reveal their identity: Nadia Rosenthal (Reviewer #1).</p><p>The reviewers have discussed the reviews with one another and the Reviewing Editor has drafted this decision to help you prepare a revised submission.</p><p>Summary:</p><p>This is an interesting and important study in which the authors compare recovery from cryoinjury in zebrafish (adult cardiac regeneration capable) and medaka, another teleost fish (adult cardiac regeneration incompetent) using comparative transcriptomics. They describe immune cell recruitment and perform functional studies to deplete macrophages in zebrafish along with stimulation of regeneration with a TLR agonist in medaka. Their results provide evidence that innate immune cells are important in efficient cardiac regeneration, and that the timing and modulation of myeloid cells may have direct roles in regulating neovascularization, cardiomyocyte proliferation and scar resolution. While the requirement for macrophages in regeneration and clearance previously has been established, demonstrating this ability across species and testing limiting factors for regeneration is of broad interest.</p><p>Essential revisions:</p><p>1) Mpx protein is expressed in most myeloid cells in fish and amphibians. The Mpx promoter used in transgenic zebrafish is brighter in neutrophils than in other myeloid cells but depending on microscopy settings can be detectible in macrophages and monocytes (see Characterization of Zebrafish Larval Inflammatory Macrophages, Dev Comp Immunol. 2009, 33: 1212-1217). Similarly, although IB4 stains microglia and other macrophage populations in fish, not all macrophages may stain with the IB4 lectin or with Mpeg-1. This lack of specificity of these markers requires some caution when quantifying macrophages versus neutrophils in their models. This should be taken into consideration when interpreting results.</p><p>2) In <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2A</xref>, although neutrophil chemotaxis-related genes appear to be upregulated in medaka relative to zebrafish, so do monocyte chemotaxis genes. This may be a sign that the situation is not as &quot;cut and dry&quot; in medaka as presented, and that monocytes rather than neutrophils may alter the inflammatory landscape. Notably, monocytes would be positive for Mpx. These confounders need to be taken into account when interpreting the neutrophil/ macrophage/ monocyte numbers with the tools in hand.</p><p>3) The study employs Poly I:C as a macrophage agonist operating via TLR3. While this mechanism is probably conserved in the cardiac context, the role for Poly I:C as a potent agonist for endothelial cells is probably also conserved (see Polyinosinic:polycytidylic acid is a potent activator of endothelial cells Am J Pathol. 1994, 145: 137-147). Poly I:C treatment in medaka results in transient endothelial activation and vessel growth, but it is not clear if this is a direct or indirect effect. If the authors seek to make this claim, studies should be performed using the existing Fli1 GFP line to clarify if Poly I:C is acting directly on the endothelial cell population or via myeloid cells in this model.</p><p>4) Of concern, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5</xref> is supposed to show reduced macrophage recruitment with clodronate treatment, however if the outflow tract is ignored it appears that at 1 dpci there are more Mpeg-1 positive cells present in the lesion of clodronate treated animals, while the number of IB4+ cells looks unchanged. At 7 dpci it is clear that there are more IB4 and Mpeg-1 positive cells in the lesion. This does not correlate with the description of the results in the text.</p><p>5) <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5</xref> uses Mef2 to mark cardiomyocytes (CMs) whereas <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8">Figure 8K</xref>/L reports enhanced CM proliferation using Edu with Phalloidin to mark CM's. How do the authors confidently assign EdU positive cells to CMs? Poly I:C is likely to stimulate proliferation of myeloid cells and endothelial cells in this model, so EdU staining should be performed in conjunction with a CM-specific marker to support their claim. Phalloidin also marks fibroblastic endothelial cells, and myofibroblasts which are both common in many wound environments. More specific markers should be used in this context such as Mef2, Nkx2.5 or sarcomeric myosin etc. to verify proliferation specifically of CMs</p><p>6) A major aspect of the paper that remains untested is whether the pro-regenerative role of macrophages is solely to reduce the neutrophil numbers. It would be meaningful for the authors to experimentally eliminate neutrophils in the medaka model and ask to what extent this promotes regeneration (in the absence or presence of macrophages). Alternatively, since there may be more NTR-type models available in zebrafish, eliminating neutrophils in chlodronate-treated zebrafish could also be used to determine the role of neutrophil clearance in promoting regeneration.</p><p>7) In <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5</xref>, it is not really evident that the chlodronate treatment eliminated any macrophages. It would be important to provide quantification as in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4</xref>. The uncertainty about macrophage clearance raises the question whether the phenotype is truly due to the chlodronate-mediated effects on macrophages. In that sense, it is unclear if PBS is the appropriate control. PBS liposomes would be a better control for this experiment. Indeed a section in the Materials and methods on the chlodronate injections and the polyI:C seems to be missing, and is important.</p><p>[Editors' note: further revisions were requested prior to acceptance, as described below.]</p><p>Thank you for submitting your article &quot;Reciprocal analyses in zebrafish and medaka reveal that harnessing the immune response promotes cardiac regeneration&quot; for consideration by <italic>eLife</italic>.

Although we realize this was not raised in the original review, it was thought it would be a good control to treat with chlodronate during larval growth when cardiomyocytes are proliferative, to show that chlodronate does not depress normal cardiomyocyte proliferation. At a minimum, you should modify the text to make note that the specificity of the chlorinate treatment is unknown.</p></body></sub-article><sub-article article-type="reply" id="SA2"><front-stub><article-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.25605.030</article-id><title-group><article-title>Author response</article-title></title-group></front-stub><body><p><italic>Essential revisions:</italic> </p><p><italic>1) Mpx protein is expressed in most myeloid cells in fish and amphibians.

Indeed, as the reviewer indicated, some myeloid cell populations might display minimal levels of Mpx expression. Amongst the zebrafish <italic>mpx</italic> reporter lines, the one mentioned by the reviewer (Mathias et al. DCI 2009) was generated with only a portion of the <italic>mpx</italic> promoter (8 kb), which might be the cause for the expression the authors observed in macrophages. Since we were aware of these issues, we used only the <italic>TgBAC(mpx:GFP)<sup>i114</sup></italic>line (Renshaw et al. Blood 2006) to maximize the specificity of the reagent.</p><p>This BAC transgenic line has been reported to specifically mark neutrophils in zebrafish; both l- plastin and neutral red stained monocytes/macrophages are negative for GFP in this line (Renshaw et al. 2006). We have also performed immunostaining for Mpx on <italic>TgBAC(mpx:GFP)<sup>i114</sup></italic>samples to test the specificity, and show new data (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s1">Figure 4—figure supplement 1</xref>). The Mpx antibody immunostained 88.23% of the <italic>mpx:</italic>GFP+ cells, and with the settings used for all our analyses, we did not observe any Mpx staining of <italic>mpx:</italic>GFP- cells.</p><p>In addition, to test the specificity of IB4 staining for macrophages, we now show IB4 staining in <italic>Tg(mpeg1.4:mCherry-F)<sup>ump2</sup>;TgBAC(mpx:GFP)<sup>i114</sup></italic>injured hearts at both 1 and 7 dpci (Figure 5—figure supplement 1), and in <italic>Tg(mpeg1:EGFP)<sup>gl22</sup></italic>at 1 mpci at high resolution (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6D</xref>). These new data show that IB4 staining colocalizes with <italic>mpeg1</italic>:mCherry+ or <italic>mpeg1</italic>:EGFP+ cells, but not with <italic>mpx</italic>:GFP+ cells in all cases.</p><p>In medaka, we show mutually exclusive labeling of Mpx+ neutrophils and IB4+ macrophages in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figures 4A</xref>,<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">7A</xref>. Since little is known about the different macrophage populations in the adult zebrafish, we now carefully indicate in the text whether the cell were IB4+ and/or <italic>mpeg</italic>+.</p><p><italic>2) In <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2A</xref>, although neutrophil chemotaxis-related genes appear to be upregulated in medaka relative to zebrafish, so do monocyte chemotaxis genes. This may be a sign that the situation is not as &quot;cut and dry&quot; in medaka as presented, and that monocytes rather than neutrophils may alter the inflammatory landscape. Notably, monocytes would be positive for Mpx. These confounders need to be taken into account when interpreting the neutrophil/ macrophage/ monocyte numbers with the tools in hand.</italic> </p><p>From the Gene Ontology website (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://www.geneontology.org/page/download-annotations">http://www.geneontology.org/page/download-annotations</ext-link>), all 24 genes in the “monocyte chemotaxis” group are a subset of the 38 “neutrophil chemotaxis” genes. Thus, from a bioinformatics standpoint, we do not have sufficient evidence to distinguish one process from the other. Therefore, and as suggested by the reviewer, we have now carefully revised the manuscript in this regard (subsection “Macrophage recruitment in medaka heart post injury is delayed and reduced compared to zebrafish”).</p><p><italic>3) The study employs Poly I:C as a macrophage agonist operating via TLR3. While this mechanism is probably conserved in the cardiac context, the role for Poly I:C as a potent agonist for endothelial cells is probably also conserved (see Polyinosinic:polycytidylic acid is a potent activator of endothelial cells Am J Pathol. 1994, 145: 137-147). Poly I:C treatment in medaka results in transient endothelial activation and vessel growth, but it is not clear if this is a direct or indirect effect. If the authors seek to make this claim, studies should be performed using the existing Fli1 GFP line to clarify if Poly I:C is acting directly on the endothelial cell population or via myeloid cells in this model.</italic> </p><p>To investigate whether the beneficial effects of poly I:C injections are mediated by macrophages or endothelial cells, we pre-depleted macrophages by clodronate liposomes (CL) injections 1 day prior to cardiac injury. We found that macrophage pre-depletion blocks both early vessel formation and CM proliferation at 7 dpci in poly I:C-exposed hearts (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figures 1</xref>,<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8">8</xref>). These new findings support the contribution of macrophages in the beneficial effects of poly I:C injections. Nevertheless, we cannot exclude the potential effects of poly I:C injections on endothelial/endocardial cells, and have modified the text accordingly (subsection “Poly I:C injection in medaka promotes heart regeneration”).</p><p><italic>4) Of concern, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5</xref> is supposed to show reduced macrophage recruitment with clodronate treatment, however if the outflow tract is ignored it appears that at 1 dpci there are more Mpeg-1 positive cells present in the lesion of clodronate treated animals, while the number of IB4+ cells looks unchanged. At 7 dpci it is clear that there are more IB4 and Mpeg-1 positive cells in the lesion. This does not correlate with the description of the results in the text.</italic> </p><p>To address this concern, we have now quantified both neutrophils and macrophages in <italic>Tg(mpeg1.4:mCherry-F)<sup>ump2</sup>;Tg(mpx:GFP)<sup>i114</sup></italic>heart sections at both 1 and 7 dpci (Figure 5—figure supplement 1), and observed that macrophages were significantly diminished in CL-exposed hearts at 1 dpci. By 7 dpci, macrophage numbers were comparable between control and CL-exposed hearts.</p><p><italic>5) <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5</xref> uses Mef2 to mark cardiomyocytes (CMs) whereas <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8">Figure 8K</xref>/L reports enhanced CM proliferation using Edu with Phalloidin to mark CM's.

More specific markers should be used in this context such as Mef2, Nkx2.5 or sarcomeric myosin etc. to verify proliferation specifically of CMs</italic> </p><p>We agree with the reviewer’s suggestion and have now repeated the experiments using <italic>Cab- Tg(zfmlc2 5.1k: DsRed2-nuc)<sup>TG1026</sup></italic>medaka, which express DsRed2 in the nuclei of their CMs. These new data show that poly I:C injections in medaka promote CM proliferation, which was blocked by pre-depletion of macrophages with CL injections (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1</xref>).</p><p><italic>6) A major aspect of the paper that remains untested is whether the pro-regenerative role of macrophages is solely to reduce the neutrophil numbers. It would be meaningful for the authors to experimentally eliminate neutrophils in the medaka model and ask to what extent this promotes regeneration (in the absence or presence of macrophages). Alternatively, since there may be more NTR-type models available in zebrafish, eliminating neutrophils in chlodronate-treated zebrafish could also be used to determine the role of neutrophil clearance in promoting regeneration.</italic> </p><p>Unfortunately and as pointed out by the reviewer, there is currently no neutrophil ablation medaka line. In order to ablate neutrophils in adult zebrafish, we crossed <italic>Tg(mpx:Gal4)<sup>SH267</sup></italic>fish (Robertson et al., Sci Transl Med 2014) with <italic>Tg(UAS-E1b:Eco.NfsB-mCherry)</italic> fish. Although these reagents have been recently shown to efficiently deplete <italic>mpx</italic>+ cells during development (Matsuoka et al., <italic>eLife</italic>, 2016), we found that the <italic>mpx:GAL4</italic> transgene is silenced in adults, thus preventing neutrophil ablation experiments in adult fish. Therefore, new tools will need to be generated for these important experiments.</p><p><italic>7) In <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5</xref>, it is not really evident that the chlodronate treatment eliminated any macrophages.
