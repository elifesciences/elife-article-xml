However, their unchecked accumulation is associated with genome instability and is observed in neurodevelopmental diseases and cancers. Genome-wide profiling of R-loops in normal and diseased cells can help identify locations of pathogenic R-loops and advance efforts to attenuate them. We present an antibody-independent R-loop detection strategy, BisMapR, that combines nuclease-based R-loop isolation with non-denaturing bisulfite chemistry to produce genome-wide profiles that retain strand information. BisMapR achieves greater resolution and is faster than existing strand-specific R-loop profiling strategies. In mouse embryonic stem cells, we apply BisMapR to find that gene promoters form R-loops in both directions and uncover a subset of active enhancers that, despite being bidirectionally transcribed, form R-loops exclusively on one strand. BisMapR reveals a previously unnoticed feature of active enhancers and provides a tool to systematically examine their mechanisms in gene expression.</p></abstract><kwd-group kwd-group-type="author-keywords"><kwd>R-loops</kwd><kwd>enhancers</kwd><kwd>strand-specific</kwd><kwd>genome-wide</kwd></kwd-group><kwd-group kwd-group-type="research-organism"><title>Research organism</title><kwd>Mouse</kwd></kwd-group><funding-group><award-group id="fund1"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000052</institution-id><institution>NIH Office of the Director</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>DP2-NS105576</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Sarma</surname><given-names>Kavitha</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund2"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000002</institution-id><institution>National Institutes of Health</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>T32CA009171</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Wulfridge</surname><given-names>Phillip</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><funding-statement>The funders had no role in study design, data collection and interpretation, or the decision to submit the work for publication.</funding-statement></funding-group><custom-meta-group><custom-meta specific-use="meta-only"><meta-name>Author impact statement</meta-name><meta-value>BisMapR reveals strand-specific R-loops with high resolution at small-scale genomic features including bidirectionally transcribed promoters and enhancers.</meta-value></custom-meta></custom-meta-group></article-meta></front><body><sec id="s1" sec-type="intro"><title>Introduction</title><p>R-loops are three-stranded nucleic acid structures that frequently occur during transcription when newly transcribed RNA base pairs with the DNA template strand, forming a DNA:RNA hybrid (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib40">Thomas et al., 1976</xref>). The non-template strand is then extruded as single-stranded DNA (ssDNA). R-loops play important roles in many nuclear processes including recombination, transcription termination, and DNA repair (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Chédin, 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Niehrs and Luke, 2020</xref>). R-loop formation in mitosis ensures faithful chromosome segregation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Kabeche et al., 2018</xref>). While R-loops at some genomic sites clearly have beneficial roles, their aberrant accumulation at others is associated with genomic instability and disease (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Crossley et al., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">García-Muse and Aguilera, 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Perego et al., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Richard and Manley, 2017</xref>). The evident role of R-loops in both cellular function and disease makes it critical that reliable methods exist for profiling their formation across the genome. These would allow for detection of changes in R-loop levels between conditions and for the characterization of features associated with their formation that could prove critical toward understanding of disease and development of potential therapies.</p><p>Current methods to detect R-loops genome-wide rely on the S9.6 antibody (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Dumelie and Jaffrey, 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Ginno et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Nadel et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib42">Wahba et al., 2016</xref>) or a catalytically inactive RNase H, both of which recognize DNA:RNA hybrids (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Chen et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Ginno et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib45">Yan et al., 2019</xref>). DNA–RNA immunoprecipitation-sequencing (DRIP-seq) is the most frequently used S9.6-based approach for R-loop detection genome-wide (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Ginno et al., 2012</xref>). In DRIP, genomic DNA is sheared by enzymatic digestion or sonication and regions that contain R-loops are immunoprecipitated using S9.6 antibody. S9.6-based approaches require high-input material, have low signal-to-noise ratio, and with the exception of BisDRIP-seq (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Dumelie and Jaffrey, 2017</xref>), have limited resolution. The low signal-to-noise ratio in S9.6 genome-wide experiments may be attributed to the antibody specificity issues that are well documented (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Hartono et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib41">Vanoosthuyse, 2018</xref>). RNase H methods that include DNA:RNA in vitro enrichment (DRIVE) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Ginno et al., 2012</xref>), R-loop chromatin immunoprecipitation (R-ChIP) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Chen et al., 2017</xref>), and MapR (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib45">Yan et al., 2019</xref>) use the evolutionary specificity of the <italic>Escherichia coli</italic> RNase H enzyme that recognizes DNA:RNA hybrids to detect R-loops. While similar to DRIP in the initial steps of sample processing, the in vitro enrichment of R-loops in DRIVE using recombinant catalytically inactive RNase H is inefficient. DRIPc (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">Sanz and Chédin, 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Sanz et al., 2016</xref>) and R-ChIP are both strand-specific techniques with some limitations. DRIPc requires much larger input amounts compared to DRIP and has lower resolution. R-ChIP, a chromatin immunoprecipitation-based strategy, requires the generation of a stable cell line that expresses a catalytic mutant RNase H1 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Chen et al., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Chen et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">Sanz and Chédin, 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Sanz et al., 2016</xref>) and, while sensitive, may not be amenable for use in all cell types. Therefore, the development of a high-resolution strand-specific R-loop detection strategy that is efficient, sensitive, and amenable to use in all cell types will help in the precise identification of specific regions of the genome that show R-loop anomalies in various diseases.</p><p>We recently described MapR (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib46">Yan and Sarma, 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib45">Yan et al., 2019</xref>), a fast and sensitive R-loop detection strategy founded on the principles of CUT and RUN (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">Skene et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">Skene and Henikoff, 2017</xref>) and the specificity of RNase H for the recognition of DNA:RNA hybrids. In MapR, a catalytically inactive RNase H targets micrococcal nuclease to R-loops to cleave and release them for high-throughput sequencing. Because MapR is not enrichment-based, unlike DRIP, DRIVE, and R-ChIP, it has high signal-to-noise ratios resulting in enhanced sensitivity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib45">Yan et al., 2019</xref>). We sought to build on the significant advantages of MapR with respect to specificity, sensitivity, and ease of use and transform it into a strand-specific R-loop profiling strategy. Here, we present BisMapR, a high-resolution, genome-wide methodology that maps strand-specific R-loops.</p></sec><sec id="s2" sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><sec id="s2-1"><title>BisMapR identifies strand-specific R-loops</title><p>Strand specificity is a key feature of bona fide R-loops. In MapR, cleaved R-loops diffuse out of the nucleus along with mRNAs and other RNAs that are not part of an R-loop. Thus, specific identification of the RNA strand of R-loops as a means of conferring strandedness is challenging with MapR. Instead, we have devised a method to distinguish the template and non-template DNA components of R-loops released by MapR. We leveraged the chemical property of sodium bisulfite to deaminate cytosines (C) to uracils (U) on exposed, single-stranded DNA (ssDNA) only, while double-stranded nucleic acids are protected from conversion (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Gough et al., 1986</xref>). In BisMapR, R-loops released by MapR are treated with sodium bisulfite under non-denaturing conditions (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1</xref>). This results in the C-to-U conversion of the ssDNA strand of R-loops. Meanwhile, the DNA within the DNA:RNA hybrid is left intact. Next, a second-strand synthesis step replaces the RNA molecule of the DNA:RNA hybrid with a dUTP-containing DNA strand. Adaptors are then ligated to resultant dsDNA. Treatment with uracil DNA glycosylase (UDG) cleaves all dUTP-containing molecules, and the unaltered DNA strand is directionally tagged, PCR amplified, and sequenced. The first-mate reads of the resulting paired-end sequencing data (or all reads for single-end runs) correspond to the DNA:RNA hybrid containing strand and are separated into forward- and reverse-strand tracks.</p><fig id="fig1" position="float"><label>Figure 1.</label><caption><title>BisMapR, an RNase H-based strand-specific native R-loop detection strategy.</title><p>Schematic of the BisMapR protocol.

Bisulfite-converted products are directly processed for second-strand synthesis in the presence of RNase H and dUTP. Adaptors are ligated to resultant dsDNA. Treatment with uracil DNA glycosylase (UDG) degrades all uracil-containing DNA molecules. Remaining DNA is tagged with paired-end barcoded index primers, amplified, sequenced, and strand-specifically aligned.

We distinguished genes as active and inactive based on RNA-seq data. MapR in mESCs specifically identifies R-loops since RNase H catalytic mutant fused to micrococcal nuclease (RHΔ-MNase) shows high signal at transcription start sites (TSS) of active genes that are known to form R-loops compared to an MNase-only background control (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s1">Figure 2—figure supplement 1A,B</xref>). MapR signal is also clearly enriched at active genes but not at inactive genes (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s1">Figure 2—figure supplement 1C</xref>). Next, we compared BisMapR to MapR in mESCs to determine whether both techniques showed signal enrichment at similar regions within genes. When examining reads from both strands, which we term ‘composite’ signal, BisMapR and MapR produce signal enrichment predominantly around the TSS of actively transcribed genes (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2A</xref>). At the global level also, both datasets showed strong positive correlation for signal enrichment across TSS (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s1">Figure 2—figure supplement 1D</xref>). When reads are separated by originating strand, MapR ‘strand-specific’ maps are near-identical to their composite (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2A</xref>), as expected of a non-strand-specific protocol. In contrast, BisMapR reads after strand-specific alignment clearly segregate to either the forward or reverse strands (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2A</xref>). <italic>Vamp1</italic>, a gene that is transcribed in the sense (plus) direction and expected to produce DNA:RNA hybrids on the reverse (template) strand, shows reverse strand-specific BisMapR signal. Similarly, <italic>Atg10</italic>, an antisense (minus) gene, shows BisMapR signal on the forward strand. Global analysis of strand-specific BisMapR signal across all TSS also showed decreased correlation with composite BisMapR as well as with strand-specific and composite MapR (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s1">Figure 2—figure supplement 1E</xref>).</p><fig-group><fig id="fig2" position="float"><label>Figure 2.</label><caption><title>BisMapR confers strand specificity to nuclease-based genome-wide R-loop detection.</title><p>(<bold>A</bold>) Genome browser views of the <italic>Vamp1</italic> and <italic>Atg10</italic> genes showing composite (dark gray) BisMapR and MapR signals (reads per million, RPM) (left) and the same signal when separated into forward (teal) and reverse (orange) strands (right).

However, non-denaturing bisulfite conversion relies on the presence of ssDNA. To assess whether BisMapR requires intact R-loops to efficiently sort signals by strand of origin, we performed bisulfite conversion reactions after treating MapR samples with RNase A and analyzed forward- or reverse-strand signals across all TSS. BisMapR samples show a clear separation of forward and reverse strands at a large number of TSS in mESCs (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2B</xref>). We observe that MapR, as a non-strand-specific technique, shows little strand separation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2B</xref>) as seen by the almost complete overlap between forward and reverse strand signals. Treatment of R-loops with RNase A prior to bisulfite processing for BisMapR results in a loss of strand specificity that resembles MapR data, with the forward- and reverse-strand signals showing a significant overlap (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2B</xref>). The residual strand separation in RNase A-treated BisMapR samples is likely due to incomplete RNase A digestion.</p><p>Next, we assessed the contribution of the bisulfite conversion step in BisMapR toward achieving strand specificity. For this, we isolated R-loops by MapR, omitted the RNase A digestion step and bisulfite conversion and proceeded to second-strand synthesis directly. R-loop signal from no-bisulfite second-strand (NBSS) samples did not separate well by strand at the vast majority of regions (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2B</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s1">Figure 2—figure supplement 1F</xref>), indicating NBSS is not sufficient for strand specificity. The absence of strand specificity in MapR NBSS can occur if R-loop structures released by MapR have intact dsDNA on both ends, which would allow both strands to ligate to adaptors and result in the extruded ssDNA to be incorporated into the sequencing library. However, the MNase digestion step in MapR can also result in the release of DNA:RNA hybrids of the R-loop that are not connected to the ssDNA strand. These DNA:RNA hybrids could contribute to strand-specific signal after second-strand synthesis. The release of ssDNA-free DNA:RNA hybrids is supported by the slightly larger scatter area of data points in MapR NBSS (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2B</xref>), and by the observation of a small number of regions where NBSS produces strand-specific signal (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2C</xref>). For example, at the <italic>Zmym6</italic> gene MapR shows near equal R-loop signal from the forward and reverse strands, while BisMapR and MapR NBSS show skewed read distribution with higher signal arising from the reverse (template) strand (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2C</xref>). Overall, our data show the bisulfite conversion step is critical to ensure removal of the ssDNA component during library preparation and achieve strand specificity.</p><p>Divergent transcription is a common feature of active promoters in mammals, with over 75% of active genes producing short antisense RNA transcripts and showing paused RNA polymerase II in the antisense direction (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Core et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Seila et al., 2008</xref>). This bidirectional transcription implies that in addition to R-loop formation on the template strand associated with transcription of the gene, R-loops would also form on the opposite strand at these divergent promoters. We used BisMapR to examine R-loops at promoters of 12,885 active genes in mESCs. As a measure of strand separation in BisMapR, we calculated the ‘strandedness’ of R-loop signal across active TSS, defined as the difference between template (T) and non-template (NT) signals (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2D</xref>, left). Upstream of the TSS, strandedness is negative, indicating R-loop signal forms predominantly on the non-template strand consistent with R-loop function in antisense transcription (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">Tan-Wong et al., 2019</xref>). Strandedness becomes positive starting around the TSS and continuing into the gene body, as expected from co-transcriptional R-loop formation on the template strand. The clear distinction between template and non-template strand-originating R-loops cannot be made in MapR, where strandedness is entirely absent at any point around TSS (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2D</xref>, center). Strandedness is only slightly observable in MapR NBSS (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2D</xref>, right), consistent with only a small subset of reads contributing to strand specificity in NBSS. Thus, our data demonstrate that BisMapR produces strand-specific R-loop profiles genome-wide. We conclude that BisMapR confers strand specificity on intact R-loops that are released by MapR with minor technical modifications and with a minimal burden on time.</p><p>R-loops contain DNA:RNA hybrid strand and a single-strand DNA. Thus regions detected by BisMapR should also show ssDNA signal. A recently developed technique, kethoxal-assisted single-stranded DNA sequencing (KAS-seq), identifies single-stranded regions of the genome with high G content (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib44">Wu et al., 2020</xref>). In KAS-seq, an azide-tagged kethoxal (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib43">Weng et al., 2020</xref>) that reacts with unpaired guanine residues and that can be modified with a biotin is used to mark and enrich for G-rich regions of the genome that are single stranded. We measured BisMapR composite signal at KAS-seq peaks and found that it is centralized over these regions (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2E</xref>). KAS-seq signal was also centrally enriched over BisMapR peaks (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2F</xref>). Consistent with this, KAS-seq and BisMapR signals show high positive correlation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s1">Figure 2—figure supplement 1G</xref>) and overlap at many active genes (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2G</xref>). We conclude that BisMapR accurately captures signal at regions of R-loop formation.</p></sec><sec id="s2-2"><title>BisMapR can distinguish individual transcriptional units with high resolution</title><p>The incorporation of bisulfite treatment that can theoretically react with all single-stranded cytosine residues in the R-loop to mark them for degradation suggests that BisMapR can produce higher resolution R-loop maps compared to MapR. To test this, we analyzed R-loop profiles at active, non-overlapping head-to-head transcriptional units that are separated by less than a kilobase (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s1">Figure 3—figure supplement 1A</xref>).

Metagene analysis across all active genes shows that both plus- and minus-strand genes show 5′ R-loop enrichment (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3D</xref>).

At <italic>Zfp462</italic>, an expressed gene in NIH 3T3 cells, DRIPc signal is broadly present across the entire gene and does not show a clear enrichment at TSS. Surprisingly, analysis of DRIPc signal profiles across all expressed genes on the plus and minus strands shows that DRIPc-seq shows a general enrichment across transcriptional units on the plus and minus strands starting at the TSS and increasing steadily across the gene body (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3E</xref>).</p><p>Our data shows that BisMapR is able to distinguish strand-specific R-loops that form at bidirectional transcription units that are separated by a few hundred bases.

Metagene analysis of all active bidirectional transcription units in NIH3T3 shows that DRIPc, while stranded as evidenced by a skew in the forward- and reverse-strand signals in the appropriate direction, does not delineate two distinct transcriptional units (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s1">Figure 3—figure supplement 1C</xref>). Our results indicate that the high resolution of BisMapR, on the order of hundreds of bases, makes it particularly suitable for studying R-loop formation across small-scale features within and between transcriptional units.</p></sec><sec id="s2-3"><title>BisMapR reveals unidirectional R-loop formation from KLF7 motifs at a subset of enhancers</title><p>Any genomic element with the potential to be transcribed can form R-loops.

To determine differential R-loop formation across enhancers, we examined R-loop signal across active, poised, and primed enhancers in mESCs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Cruz-Molina et al., 2017</xref>). Active enhancers are bidirectionally transcribed (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Kim et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Lai et al., 2015</xref>) and show higher global run-on sequencing (GRO-Seq) signals on both the forward and reverse strands as compared to poised and primed enhancers (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s1">Figure 4—figure supplement 1A</xref>). Active, poised, and primed enhancers also contain specific chromatin signatures including histone H3 lysine four monomethylation (H3K4me1) and histone H3 lysine 27 acetylation (H3K27Ac) at active enhancers, H3K4me1 and H3K27 trimethylation (H3K27me3) at poised enhancers, and H3K4me1 at primed enhancers (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Creyghton et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Rada-Iglesias et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib47">Zentner et al., 2011</xref>). We found that active enhancers also exhibit higher MapR and BisMapR signals compared to poised and primed enhancers (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s1">Figure 4—figure supplement 1A,B</xref>). Interestingly, clustering of all enhancers based on BisMapR forward- and reverse-strand signals reveals four distinct enhancer clusters: two groups with high R-loops that form on either the reverse (group 1) or forward (group 2) strands, and two groups with medium or low R-loops (groups 3 and 4) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4A</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s1">Figure 4—figure supplement 1C</xref>). Both groups of high R-loop enhancers display R-loops on only one strand. GRO-seq also indicates that group 1 and group 2 enhancers are expressed at higher levels than group 4 enhancers (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4B</xref>). Group 3 enhancers also had high GRO-Seq levels and may represent enhancers that are expressed without high R-loop formation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4B</xref>). Next, we examined the distribution of active, poised, and primed enhancers across these four groups that we defined based on BisMapR profiles. Group 1 is strongly enriched for active enhancers (71%; p=2.49e-167, hypergeometric test for all enrichment p-values) and slightly enriched for poised enhancers (0.05%; p=2.95e-5) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4C</xref>). Similarly, group 2 is also enriched for active (72%; p=8.03e-164) and poised enhancers (0.04%; p=0.039). In contrast, the low R-loop (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4A</xref>) and low transcribed (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4B</xref>) group 4 is enriched for primed enhancers (74%; p=3.95e-1160) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4C</xref>). As expected, genes proximal to group 1 and 2 enhancers, which are enriched for active enhancers, show higher expression levels compared to group 3 and 4 enhancer-related genes (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s1">Figure 4—figure supplement 1D</xref>). To determine whether unidirectional R-loops are observed by other strand-specific R-loop detection strategies, we analyzed DRIPc data from 3T3 cells. Unsupervised clustering of 3T3 enhancers based on DRIPc forward and reverse signals also showed separation into four groups – two high R-loop enhancer groups with DRIPc either on the forward or reverse strands and two low R-loop enhancer clusters (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s1">Figure 4—figure supplement 1E</xref>).

We used CentriMo to identify sequences that are centrally enriched in the two high R-loop enhancer groups (groups 1 and 2) compared to the low R-loop groups (groups 3 and 4). Our analysis uncovered a significant enrichment for KLF7, KLF1, and SP1 transcription factor motifs in the high R-loop enhancer groups (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4D</xref>). Since all three motifs appear to have a high GC content, we performed a GC skew analysis to determine whether the non-template strand that forms the ssDNA component of R-loops is enriched for guanines (G). We found that the non-template strands in groups 1 and 2 have high G content, while groups 3 and 4 show no skew (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4E</xref>). It is possible that the abundance of guanines on the ssDNA can promote the formation of G-quadruplex (GQ) structures that may aid in stabilization of these enhancer R-loops. We compared BisMapR signal at enhancers to KAS-seq signal, which detects ssDNA, and found that high R-loop enhancers as determined by our analysis (groups 1 and 2) exhibit high KAS-seq signal, consistent with our observation of GC skew and the likelihood of containing ssDNA, a component of R-loops (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4F</xref>). To further determine the degree of concordance between KAS-Seq and BisMapR, we performed clustering of all enhancers based on KAS-seq signal, identifying 5069 enhancers with high KAS-seq signal and 27,811 enhancers with low KAS-seq signal. Seven hundred and four enhancers had both high KAS-seq and high R-loop signals, representing a 1.53-fold enrichment (p=1.96e-35, hypergeometric test). In contrast, enhancers with high R-loops were under-enriched (1.14-fold, p=4.21e-63) in the enhancer population with low KAS-seq signals. Therefore, BisMapR and KAS-seq present two complementary methods to identify enhancers that contain ssDNA components.</p><p>Motif analysis at high R-loop enhancers identified an enrichment for KLF7, KLF1, and SP1 binding sites (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4D</xref>). KLF7, KLF1, and SP1 are pioneer transcription factors that have the ability to bind DNA and open condensed chromatin. Interestingly, analysis of transcription factor binding across DNase I hypersensitive sites showed that KLF7 motif is associated with asymmetrically open chromatin, suggesting a directional pioneer factor activity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">Sherwood et al., 2014</xref>). To examine whether R-loops are skewed at enhancers that contain KLF7 binding sites, we re-centered enhancer regions in groups 1 and 2 around their KLF7 motifs and examined BisMapR signal (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4G</xref>). Interestingly, in both these groups strand-specific R-loops form unidirectionally from KLF motifs (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4G, I and J</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s1">Figure 4—figure supplement 1F</xref>). The presence of H3K27 acetylation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4I and J</xref>) and GRO-seq signals (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4H, I and J</xref>) around the KLF7-centered enhancers show clear bidirectional transcription. Our data suggests that KLF7 binding may contribute to the unidirectional formation or stabilization of R-loops at some active enhancers that show high levels of transcription.</p></sec></sec><sec id="s3" sec-type="discussion"><title>Discussion</title><p>Genome-wide R-loop mapping relies on two distinct approaches, the S9.6 antibody and a catalytically inactive RNase H, that both recognize DNA:RNA hybrids. These two approaches recognize some common R-loops, as well as other unique subsets that likely appear as a consequence of the distinct sequence preferences of S9.6 and RNase H (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">König et al., 2017</xref>). Therefore, orthogonal approaches that are sensitive, that are efficient, and that retain strand specificity will allow for comprehensive interrogation of R-loop dynamics in various cellular processes and their dysfunction in disease. Here, we have described BisMapR, a fast RNase H-based method that efficiently captures strand-specific R-loops at high-resolution genome-wide.</p><p>Existing strand-specific R-loop mapping strategies have a few drawbacks that include low-resolution and high-input material (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">Sanz and Chédin, 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Sanz et al., 2016</xref>), involved sample processing (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Dumelie and Jaffrey, 2017</xref>), and lengthy experiment times (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Chen et al., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Chen et al., 2017</xref>). Our comparison of BisMapR with DRIPc, an S9.6-based approach, shows that BisMapR produces sharper regions of enrichment suggesting higher resolution (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3</xref>). The high resolution of BisMapR is especially evident at head-to-head transcribed genes TSS that are only a few hundred bases apart and that show R-loop formation on opposite strands. As noted before (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">Sanz and Chédin, 2019</xref>), a reason for the broader signal seen in DRIPc can be because of immunoprecipitation of the regions of the RNA that are not part of the R-loop. While non-denaturing bisulfite treatment can potentially correct this drawback, DRIPc still requires a significantly higher amount of starting material compared to DRIP and MapR. Bisulfite conversion of DRIP samples <italic>after</italic> immunoprecipitation may help reduce input requirement and achieve higher resolution and provide an S9.6-based approach that is on par with the resolution and sensitivity of BisMapR.</p><p>Despite differences in R-loop identification between BisMapR and DRIPc, we have previously noted that S9.6- and RNase H-based techniques identify many common R-loops in addition to some that are distinct to each method (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib45">Yan et al., 2019</xref>). For example, while DRIPc does not cleanly separate signal at bidirectional promoters, it still shows skew in the appropriate direction at these regions (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s1">Figure 3—figure supplement 1C</xref>). DRIPc also identifies enhancers with broadly increased R-loop signal on one strand only (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s1">Figure 4—figure supplement 1D</xref>). The differences between S9.6- and RNase H-based methods could arise from the molecular preferences of S9.6 antibody and RNase H. In vitro studies show that S9.6 prefers binding R-loops with lower GC content (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">König et al., 2017</xref>). Whether RNase H preferences to a specific R-loop structure is not yet known.</p><p>At active gene promoters, BisMapR identifies both non-template signal upstream of the TSS that is consistent with antisense divergent transcription, and template signal centered around the TSS and continuing downstream into the gene body. Interestingly, template signal is not confined strictly downstream of the TSS, but instead is enriched slightly upstream and predominantly downstream of the TSS with a slight dip in signal over the TSS itself. This is a pattern also observed in MapR (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s1">Figure 2—figure supplement 1B</xref>). MapR relies on the docking of the GST-tagged catalytically inactive RNaseH (RHΔ) on R-loops and the subsequent cleavage around the interaction site by the MNase moiety. We predict that the reason we see a broad signal that extends upstream of TSS is because of where R-loops start, the binding of GST-RHΔ-MNase protein at these sites and the ability of MNase moiety to access the upstream region when bound. These together would result in the appearance of signal slightly upstream and downstream of the TSS. Another possibility is that BisMapR can detect R-loops forming from alternative TSS usage, or extra-coding RNAs (ecRNAs) that precede TSS, both of which would result in signal upstream of annotated start sites.</p><p>Using BisMapR, we uncovered a subset of enhancers with high R-loops and that have a high GC skew. R-loop formation is associated with the potential to form G quadruplexes on the non-template strand. Two recent studies using single-molecule approaches have provided insight into how G quadruplexes and R-loop formation regulate gene expression. While R-loop formation precedes GQ formation, stable GQs in the non-template strand provide a positive feedback to promote R-loops during transcription (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Lim and Hohng, 2020</xref>). Transcription efficiency is increased as a result of successive rounds of R-loop formation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Lee et al., 2020</xref>). Taken together with our finding of high R-loops at some enhancers, it is possible that R-loop formation and GQ stabilization lead to the maintenance of nucleosome-free regions and help in sustained enhancer activation.</p><p>In summary, BisMapR is a fast, sensitive, and strand-specific R-loop detection strategy that reveals strand-specific R-loops at enhancers that are also enriched for KLF7 pioneer factor-binding motifs. Our study provides a tool to further dissect how directional chromatin accessibility conferred by a subset of pioneer factors contributes to R-loop stabilization at enhancers and their combined significance to gene expression.</p></sec><sec id="s4" sec-type="materials|methods"><title>Materials and methods</title><sec id="s4-1"><title>Cell culture</title><p>E14 mouse embryonic stem cells (mESCs) were a gift from Dr. Roberto Bonasio’s lab at the University of Pennsylvania.

Specifically, reads with SAM flags 16, 83, or 163 were placed into the forward-strand dataset, while reads with SAM flags 0, 99, or 147 were placed into the reverse-strand dataset. The first-mate strand represents the template strand for BisMapR, MapR, and DRIPc-seq. RPM normalization for strand-specific datasets was calculated based on the combined number of reads assigned to either the forward or reverse strand. BigWig tracks were generated using the bamCoverage function in deepTools 3.4.1 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Ramírez et al., 2016</xref>) with options <monospace>--binSize</monospace> five and <monospace>--blackListFileName</monospace> to remove a known set of ENCODE blacklist regions (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Amemiya et al., 2019</xref>). The <monospace>--extendReads</monospace> option was used for paired-end datasets. Strandedness was calculated by subtracting reverse- strand BigWig signal from forward-strand BigWig signal for reverse-strand genes and vice versa for forward-strand genes. Peak calling of BisMapR composite samples was performed using MACS2 version 2.1.1 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib48">Zhang et al., 2008</xref>). Signal plots and heatmaps were generated using the computeMatrix, plotProfile, and plotHeatmap functions in deepTools. Motif enrichment analysis was performed with CentriMo using 500 bp sequences centered around each enhancer.</p></sec><sec id="s4-6"><title>Published data</title><p>We downloaded FASTQ files for NIH3T3 DRIPc-seq (SRR3322169) and NIH3T3 RNA-seq (SRR6126847), BigWig tracks and peak locations for KAS-seq (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib44">Wu et al., 2020</xref>) (GSE139420), GRO-seq (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">Tastemel et al., 2017</xref>) (GSE99760) and H3K27Ac (ENCODE ENCFF163HEV), mESC enhancer locations from <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Cruz-Molina et al., 2017</xref>, and 3T3 enhancers from the Enhancer Atlas (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Gao and Qian, 2020</xref>).</p></sec></sec></body><back><ack id="ack"><title>Acknowledgements</title><p>We thank A Gardini and R Bonasio for helpful discussions, and Q Yan for assistance with MapR experiments.

Your article has been reviewed by three peer reviewers, including Howard Y Chang as the Reviewing Editor and Reviewer #1, and the evaluation has been overseen by Kevin Struhl as the Senior Editor.</p><p>The reviewers have discussed the reviews with one another and the Reviewing Editor has drafted this decision to help you prepare a revised submission.</p><p>As the editors have judged that your manuscript is of interest, but as described below that additional experiments are required before it is published, we would like to draw your attention to changes in our revision policy that we have made in response to COVID-19 (https://elifesciences.org/articles/57162). First, because many researchers have temporarily lost access to the labs, we will give authors as much time as they need to submit revised manuscripts. We are also offering, if you choose, to post the manuscript to bioRxiv (if it is not already there) along with this decision letter and a formal designation that the manuscript is &quot;in revision at <italic>eLife</italic>&quot;. Please let us know if you would like to pursue this option. (If your work is more suitable for medRxiv, you will need to post the preprint yourself, as the mechanisms for us to do so are still in development.)</p><p>Summary:</p><p>Wulfridge and Sarma describe a new approach to map R-loops genome-wide. Using sodium bisulfite conversion, the ssDNA of the R-loop is targeted and specifically the DNA hybridized to the RNA in the R loop is sequenced. The approach yields strand specific information on where R-loops form and at high resolution. While the approach might be an important advance, some results don't make sense which prompts concerns about the possibility of artifacts or strong biases.</p><p>Essential revisions:</p><p>1) Comparison of BisMapR with alternative methods to clarify the methodologic advance.</p><p>a) If strand-specific library construction kit is used in MapR the authors may achieve strand-specific detection already. Please justify why bisulfite treatment is needed.</p><p>b) The authors compare their data to another approach that maps R-loops in a strand specific manner, DRIPc-seq. The two methods give strikingly different results. The authors do not give any rationale for why this is. Could BisMapR be extremely selective? Perhaps it is only mapping the most stable R-loops, those that can form G-quadraplexes or are stabilized by another mechanism.</p><p>c) Comparison with single stranded DNA detection method like KAS-seq would be informative. Single-stranded DNA is a kind of proxy for R-loops. BisMap-R should provide richer data but may need more cells and may not be applicable to clinical tissue samples.</p><p>2) Biological insight of divergent transcription at promoters and enhancers.</p><p>Divergent transcription: The authors rightfully cite the bias of R-loops on the template strand as evidence that their approach works (Figure 2C). They also mention that they see R-loops in the region upstream of TSSs, which they reason arrive from antisense divergent transcription seen at upstream of most mammalian promoters. However, the authors see both template and non-template signal at these locations at identical levels. How is this possible? There wouldn't be template RNA before the TSS. With the purported resolution of the method, this should be resolvable.</p><p>Enhancers: The authors find that bidirectionally transcribed enhancers have an R-loop only on one strand.

To determine if we could achieve strand-specific detection with MapR, we omitted RNase A at the R-loop collection step and directly proceeded to second strand synthesis (MapR no bisulfite second strand – NBSS). Our results indicate that MapR NBSS sample are <bold>not</bold> strand-specific (Figure 2B); instead, reads are distributed almost evenly across both strands like the MapR sample. However, we detect a slight skew in the MapR NBSS reads obtained congruent with the direction of transcription (Figure 2D, E, and Figure 2—figure supplement 1F). This result indicates that second-strand synthesis alone is insufficient for removing the ssDNA component of R-loops during library preparation and that bisulfite treatment is need to confer strandedness to MapR samples.</p><p>One explanation for our observed results is that intact R-loops cleaved and released by MapR may be flanked by dsDNA – in fact, this is highly likely considering that the original MapR protocol (Yan et al., 2019), which adds RNase A to digest RNA, generates dsDNA molecules immediately suitable for library preparation. Such intact R-loops could be successfully adaptor-ligated on both strands despite partial ssDNA within the structure. Both strands would then be amplified and sequenced. With this rationale, RNA:DNA hybrids that are separated from ssDNA during MNase cleavage – that is, molecules without dsDNA ends – would be successfully converted and sequenced in a strand-specific manner by both BisMapR and MapR NBSS. Indeed, we identify a subset of R-loops where MapR NBSS signal is skewed and resembles BisMapR signal (Figure 2E). Notably, many of these regions have low MapR signal, consistent with RNA:DNA hybrid molecules at these regions being converted to ssDNA by addition of RNase A and subsequently lost in MapR libraries. Our analyses indicate that both bisulfite conversion and second-strand synthesis are instrumental to fully capturing R-loops in a strand-specific manner.</p><p>These results are detailed in the revised manuscript.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>b) The authors compare their data to another approach that maps R-loops in a strand specific manner, DRIPc-seq. The two methods give strikingly different results. The authors do not give any rationale for why this is. Could BisMapR be extremely selective? Perhaps it is only mapping the most stable R-loops, those that can form G-quadraplexes or are stabilized by another mechanism.</p></disp-quote><p>We think the main reason for differences obtained upon comparison of BisMapR and DRIPc (Figure 2) is the resolution of each technique. BisMapR offers higher resolution that DRIPc. As noted in a recent protocol paper by the authors who developed DRIPc (Sanz and Chedin, 2019), a potential limitation of DRIPc, that can result in false positive signal and decrease resolution, is the presence of “trailing” peaks that arise from the free portion of the RNA that is not involved in R-loop formation. However, our analysis of bi-directional promoters using BisMapR and DRIPc do not show contradicting results. While DRIPc does not clearly separate bidirectional promoters, it still shows a clear skew in the appropriate direction at these promoters (Figure 3—figure supplement 1C). Our enhancer analyses also show agreement between BisMapR and DRIPc (Figure 4). Both BisMapR and DRIPc discover unidirectional R-loops at a subset of active enhancers in mESCs and 3T3, respectively (Figure 4A, Figure 4—figure supplement 1E-F).</p><p>Additionally, we have shown previously that S9.6 and RNase H based techniques identify many common R-loops and also some that are distinct (Yan et al., 2019). DRIPc uses S9.6 to capture DNA:RNA hybrids. in vitro studies show that S9.6 prefers binding R-loops with lower GC content (Konig, Schubert and Langst, 2017). Whether RNase H has molecular preferences to a specific R-loop structures is not known. We have included this in the Discussion in the revised manuscript.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>c) Comparison with single stranded DNA detection method like KAS-seq would be informative. Single-stranded DNA is a kind of proxy for R-loops. BisMap-R should provide richer data but may need more cells and may not be applicable to clinical tissue samples.</p></disp-quote><p>We had utilized KAS-seq data in our analysis of enhancer elements, and now perform a more global comparison of BisMapR to KAS-Seq. We examined BisMapR signal over KAS-seq peaks obtained from literature and found that BisMapR was centrally enriched across these KAS-seq peaks, indicating that BisMapR captures signal over ssDNA regions that correspond to R-loops (Figure 2G). In our analyses, KAS-seq signal was also centrally enriched over BisMapR peaks (Figure 2H). The two datasets show strong positive correlation (Pearson correlation coefficient = 0.99). Consistent with this global finding, KAS-seq and BisMapR signals show enrichment at many shared genomic sites. We have added this analysis to the manuscript.</p><p>KAS-seq and BisMapR do not completely overlap. Sites where KAS-seq signal is present, but not BisMapR, may represent single stranded areas of the genome that are R-loop independent (Kouzine, Cell Syst. 2017). Similarly, regions with BisMapR, but not KAS-seq may either be a result for incomplete kethoxal reactivity or dynamic R-loops that are only captured by BisMapR. However, because these require further experimental proof to elucidate the true structure of nucleic acids at these regions, we have not discussed these in the manuscript.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>2) Biological insight of divergent transcription at promoters and enhancers.</p><p>Divergent transcription: The authors rightfully cite the bias of R-loops on the template strand as evidence that their approach works (Figure 2C). They also mention that they see R-loops in the region upstream of TSSs, which they reason arrive from antisense divergent transcription seen at upstream of most mammalian promoters. However, the authors see both template and non-template signal at these locations at identical levels. How is this possible? There wouldn't be template RNA before the TSS. With the purported resolution of the method, this should be resolvable.</p></disp-quote><p>We thank the reviewers for this insightful observation. We have performed a more detailed breakdown of R-loop distribution at active promoters in order to bring more clarity to this result.</p><p>First, we think the confusion regarding template and non-template signal appearing equivalent upstream of the TSS arises from the nature of how metagene plots combine signal. When individually examined, upstream R-loop signal can be broadly classified into two types. In a relatively small subset of active genes, strong non-template R-loop is strictly confined upstream of the TSS. In contrast, a larger group of active genes has template R-loop signal centered around the TSS; this signal begins slightly upstream of the TSS and continues into the gene body. Notably, non-template and template signal is generally mutually exclusive, indicating that BisMapR achieves strand separation at these upstream regions. However, because there are fewer genes with strong non-template signal upstream of TSS than genes with template signal around the TSS, averaging signal across all active TSS in a metagene plot gives the false impression that template and non-template strands are equal. To avoid this confusion, we have replaced the metaplot with a measure of “strandedness” obtained by subtracting non-template from template signal at each individual region (Figure 2F). This computation more accurately reflects the predominance of non-template signal upstream of the TSS, followed by template signal around and past the TSS.</p><p>Regarding the presence of template strand upstream of the TSS, we have consistently observed that template and non-template strands show a “two-peak” pattern. This is most apparent on active genes with template strand signal, where a broad peak appears to have a dip at the TSS and signal extending slightly upstream and further downstream. Interestingly, this is a pattern we observe at the same genes across several independent MapR/BisMapR experiments in mESCs (Figure 2C and Figure 2—figure supplement 1B). We notice that upstream of the TSS, this signal drops off around the 150bp mark, while it decreases more gradually downstream of the TSS. MapR relies on the docking of the GST tagged catalytically inactive RNaseH (RH∆) on R-loops and the subsequent cleavage around the interaction site by the MNase moiety. We predict that the reason we see signal extending upstream of TSS is because of where R-loops start, the binding of GST-RH∆-MNase protein at these sites and the ability of MNase moiety to access the upstream region when bound. This results in the appearance of signal that originates from the template RNA upstream of TSS. Alternatively, the actual transcription start site for some genes might be upstream of the annotated position we use either because of alternative TSS usage or because of the existence of upstream “extra-coding” RNAs (ecRNAs) (Di Ruscio et al. Nature 2013). We now include discussion of these possibilities in the revised manuscript.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Enhancers: The authors find that bidirectionally transcribed enhancers have an R-loop only on one strand.

We obtained a list of enhancers in NIH-3T3 cells from the Enhancer Atlas (http://www.enhanceratlas.org/) and analyzed NIH-3T3 DRIPc-seq signal over these regions. Mirroring our findings in E14 mESCs, a subset of 3T3 enhancers contain DRIPc-seq signal on either the forward or reverse strand only (Figure 4—figure supplement 1E-F). However, because of the resolution limit of DRIPc, the strand specific signal across enhancers is more diffuse in comparison to BisMapR’s narrower and highly centralized signal. Thus, both BisMapR and DRIPc reveal unidirectional R-loops at enhancers. This is now detailed in the revised manuscript.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>b) The fact that some features are so different between group 1 and group 2 enhancers is confusing. First there are so many fewer Group 2 enhancers compared to Group 1. It suggests an asymmetry to which strand of the DNA R-loops form in, which does not seem possible. And then there is a higher GC skew for group 2 enhancers. The strand asymmetries are either clues as to what is going on or a potential computational artifact.</p></disp-quote><p>We thank the reviewers for pointing out this potential source of confusion. They are correct in that the ostensible imbalance in number and GC skew between Group 1 and Group 2 enhancer stems from a computational step, namely the unsupervised k-means clustering step. In this case, the clustering algorithm grouped some regions of medium R-loop formation into the reverse-R-loop cluster (Group 1). While we do not believe this grouping affects our overall conclusions, we agree that using a method that reduces the asymmetry between groups will help reduce confusion and increase the clarity of our results.</p><p>We have thus used the k-means algorithm to group enhancers into four clusters, rather than three, and found that this resolves the issue: the two high R-loop groups have universally strong R-loop signal on either the forward or reverse strand only (Figure 4A) , are more equivalent in the number of enhancers in each group, and have comparable GC skews (Figure 4E). High R-loop groups remain centrally and significantly enriched for KLF7, KLF1, and SP1 motifs (Figure 4D), and our overall observations on the nature of these unidirectional R-loop enhancers remain unchanged. We have updated Figure 4 and Figure 4—figure supplement 1C to reflect our new 4-cluster analysis and edited text and enhancer numbers as appropriate.</p></body></sub-article></article>
