contribute to its daily dynamics and to what extent. Using a statistical approach, we previously demonstrated that hourly brain temperature values co-varied strongly with time spent awake (Hoekstra et al., 2019). Here we develop and make available a mathematical tool to simulate and predict cortical temperature in mice based on a 4-s sleep–wake sequence. Our model estimated cortical temperature with remarkable precision and accounted for 91% of the variance based on three factors: sleep–wake sequence, time-of-day (‘circadian’), and a novel ‘prior wake prevalence’ factor, contributing with 74%, 9%, and 43%, respectively (including shared variance). We applied these optimized parameters to an independent cohort of mice and predicted cortical temperature with similar accuracy. This model confirms the profound influence of sleep–wake state on brain temperature, and can be harnessed to differentiate between thermoregulatory and sleep–wake-driven effects in experiments affecting both.</p></abstract><kwd-group kwd-group-type="author-keywords"><kwd>brain temperature</kwd><kwd>sleep-wake state</kwd><kwd>model</kwd><kwd>mice</kwd></kwd-group><kwd-group kwd-group-type="research-organism"><title>Research organism</title><kwd>Mouse</kwd></kwd-group><funding-group><award-group id="fund1"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100005155</institution-id><institution>Azrieli Foundation</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>Azrieli Fellowship Award</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Sela</surname><given-names>Yaniv</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund2"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100001711</institution-id><institution>Swiss National Science Foundation</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>SNF n°146694</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Franken</surname><given-names>Paul</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund3"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution>State of Vaud</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Sela</surname><given-names>Yaniv</given-names></name><name><surname>Hoekstra</surname><given-names>Marieke MB</given-names></name><name><surname>Franken</surname><given-names>Paul</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><funding-statement>The funders had no role in study design, data collection and interpretation, or the decision to submit the work for publication.</funding-statement></funding-group><custom-meta-group><custom-meta specific-use="meta-only"><meta-name>Author impact statement</meta-name><meta-value>The sleep–wake state sequence explains almost all of the variance in brain temperature in the mouse, and its detailed dynamics can be accurately predicted only using sleep–wake information.</meta-value></custom-meta></custom-meta-group></article-meta></front><body><sec id="s1" sec-type="intro"><title>Introduction</title><p>Brain temperature is a fundamental physiological variable that can affect numerous neural processes, from basic properties such as nerve conduction velocity, passive membrane potential, and synaptic transmission, to global regulation of brain activity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib51">Wang et al., 2014</xref>). Specifically, fluctuations within the physiological temperature range (33–37°C in rodents) have been shown to modify channel kinetics (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib42">Rosen, 2001</xref>), reuptake of neurotransmitters by transporters (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib53">Xie et al., 2000</xref>), miniature postsynaptic currents (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib46">Simkus and Stricker, 2002</xref>), the neuronal firing rates of single neurons (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib49">Tryba and Ramirez, 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Guatteo et al., 2005</xref>), and neuronal synchronization (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Csernai et al., 2019</xref>). Conversely, neuronal activity is one of the main determinants of brain temperature (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Kiyatkin et al., 2002</xref>). Thus, brain activity both affects and is affected by fluctuations in temperature. In clinical settings, brain temperature increases in common pathological conditions such as stroke or head injury (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">Mrozek et al., 2012</xref>), and temperature is deliberately lowered in interventions to protect the brain from hypoxic events (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Faridar et al., 2011</xref>). Since heat plays a crucial role in neuronal functioning (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Kiyatkin, 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Alonso and Marder, 2020</xref>) and brain tissue is very sensitive to thermal damage (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib54">Yarmolenko et al., 2011</xref>), it is crucial to understand which factors contribute to changes in brain temperature under normal circumstances.</p><p>Generally, brain temperature is considered to be the net result of heat production, which is determined by brain metabolism, and heat dissipation, which is determined by brain blood flow and the brain-to-blood temperature gradient (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Hayward and Baker, 1969</xref>). The sleep–wake states, non–rapid-eye-movement (NREM) sleep, rapid-eye-movement (REM) sleep, and wakefulness, define brain states associated with specific neuronal activities, oxygen consumption, and metabolism (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">Nir et al., 2013</xref>). The latter two (active) brain states are accompanied by increases in brain temperature, whereas NREM sleep evidences a decrease (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Hayward and Baker, 1969</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">Obál et al., 1985</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Franken et al., 1992a</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Hoekstra et al., 2019</xref>). Besides decreased heat production, increased heat dissipation further contributes to the decreases in brain temperature during NREM sleep: (i) although the global blood flow to the brain decreases in absolute terms, it increases when taking the considerable drop in oxygen consumption during NREM sleep into account (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">McAvoy et al., 2019</xref>), and (ii) since body temperature is actively down-regulated through peripheral vasodilation (and perspiration in humans) after sleep onset, the brain-to-blood temperature gradient increases (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib47">Szymusiak, 2018</xref>).</p><p>By quantifying the relationship between sleep–wake state and brain temperature we reported that the sleep–wake distribution explains 84% of the variance in brain temperature in the rat (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Franken et al., 1992b</xref>), a finding we recently replicated in the mouse (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Hoekstra et al., 2019</xref>). However, the 1992 analysis has been criticized for overestimating the impact of sleep–wake state by having averaged over hourly intervals and ignoring other contributing factors such as locomotion (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Heller et al., 2011</xref>), and the sequential nature of assessing the contribution of sleep–wake and circadian-related factors (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib52">Witting and Mirmiran, 1997</xref>). Although recent studies have found the contribution of locomotor activity to brain temperature to be negligible (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib44">Shirey et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Hoekstra et al., 2019</xref>) and confirmed that circadian factors do not contribute significantly to brain temperature (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Baker et al., 2005</xref>), the concerns underlying the use of hourly values and a fixed order of assessing the contributing factors have not been directly addressed.</p><p>To resolve these outstanding issues, we drew on a recent dataset (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Hoekstra et al., 2019</xref>) to develop a mathematical model that simulates changes in brain temperature at the high time resolution required to account for its rapid fluctuations during sleep–wake state transitions. This new model explained 91% of the variance in brain temperature and reduced the model error to 0.26°C down from an observed dynamic range of 3.13°C. In addition to accurately capturing the short-term dynamics associated with sleep–wake transitions, the model revealed prior wake prevalence as a novel, longer-term factor altering the range of values within which brain temperature is regulated. The circadian factor explained 9.3% of the overall variance in brain temperature, of which 7.6% was redundant with the contribution of the other two factors. Finally, we show that the model can accurately predict brain temperature dynamics in an independent cohort of mice using the parameter settings obtained in the main experiment. This model thus, contributes to better documenting and quantifying the fundamental dependence of brain temperature on the sleep–wake state.</p></sec><sec id="s2" sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><p>Wakefulness and REM sleep can be considered to be the opposite of NREM sleep in brain temperature dynamics.

The four free parameters of this basic model were the two time constants (in hours) and the values of the two asymptotes (in °C) between which brain temperature could vary. Drawing on previous results and assumptions (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Franken et al., 1992b</xref>), we initially set the values for both time constants to 0.47 hr, the lower and upper asymptotes to the minimum and maximum temperatures reached in each animal during the 96-hr recording, respectively, and the initial temperature (<inline-formula><mml:math id="inf6"><mml:mstyle displaystyle="true" scriptlevel="0"><mml:mrow><mml:msub><mml:mi>T</mml:mi><mml:mrow><mml:mn>0</mml:mn></mml:mrow></mml:msub></mml:mrow></mml:mstyle></mml:math></inline-formula>) to the average temperature in the first 5 min of the recording. However, the following features were further developed to improve the simulation: (1) as already mentioned above, we defined 2 different time constants to represent the increase and decrease in temperature, instead of just 1 for both processes, (2) the asymptote values were free parameters, (3) all free parameters were simultaneously optimized for each mouse, (4) optimization took into consideration the entire recording, including sleep deprivation and recovery, instead of the baseline period alone, and (5) performance was assessed at a sub-minute time scale; that is, the 4-s resolution at which the sleep–wake states were determined, rather than at an hourly resolution.</p><p>Based on this more refined model, referred to as Model 0, we simulated the temperature recordings based on the individual sleep–wake state sequence data (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1</xref>), with an average correlation coefficient (r) of 0.91, and a median root mean square (RMS) error of 0.36°C across animals. Generally, the time constant of wakefulness was higher than the one of NREM sleep (i.e., in 9 out of 11 mice; with median of 0.33 vs. 0.23 hr), indicating that the rate of increase of cortical temperature during wakefulness was slower than its decrease in NREM sleep. The difference between the upper and lower asymptotes varied by roughly 3°C, with the upper asymptotes consistently near the temperature values observed during SD (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="supp1">Supplementary file 1</xref>).</p><fig-group><fig id="fig1" position="float"><label>Figure 1.</label><caption><title>Results of Model 0 with constant asymptotes.</title><p>(<bold>A</bold>) A representative example of a 96-hr recording in one mouse of brain temperature (blue) and simulated data (orange).

When we examined the time course of the average hourly residuals of the model across animals (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1B</xref>), we found a systematic fluctuation in the fit; during the baseline light periods simulated values were too high and during the dark periods too low, compared to the recorded temperature values. The residual RMS (i.e., the RMS of the averaged hourly residuals) amounted to 0.19°C. However, the residuals during sleep deprivation (SD) which occurred during the light period resembled those observed during the dark period, which argues against a simple circadian modulation. Although incorporating a circadian modulation of both asymptotes as previously done in the rat (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Franken et al., 1992b</xref>) somewhat improved the overall fit (RMS error = 0.32°C; residual RMS = 0.15°C), it did not abolish the apparent periodicity in the baseline residuals in mice and resulted in an even poorer fit during SD (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1</xref>). Given the time-of-day independent similarity between the residuals during the SD and the dark phase, an alternative factor that could contribute to a temporary upregulation of brain temperature (beyond the sleep–wake state- driven changes already captured by the simulation) could be the prior periods of sustained wakefulness (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">Obermeyer et al., 1991</xref>). To explore this possibility, instead of a circadian modulation, we changed the asymptotes according to the prevalence of wakefulness (and REM sleep, for consistency) prior to each data point. We refer to this factor as ‘prior wake prevalence’. The window size over which prior wake prevalence was calculated, as well as the time lag for affecting the asymptotes, were kept as free parameters. Modulation of the asymptotes according to prior wake prevalence considerably improved the fit (r = 0.95; RMS error = 0.28°C; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2</xref>) and removed most of the excessive overestimations during light periods, as well as the underestimation of temperature during the dark periods (see arrows in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2A</xref>). We found that the optimal window size was 4.0 hr, with a shift of 1.5 hr prior to the time point under consideration, and a scaling factor of 1.2°C. The latter parameter represents the maximum possible modulation of either asymptote (i.e., 100% wakefulness or 100% NREM sleep during a given 4.0 hr window; <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="supp2">Supplementary file 2</xref>). We optimized all the parameters simultaneously in this new model (i.e., Model 1) and found that all of the values obtained with Model 0 changed significantly (p≤0.002; <italic>F</italic>(2,10) ≥ 9.98, one-way repeated measures analysis of variance [rANOVA]): the lower asymptote increased, leading to a substantial reduction in the inter-asymptote temperature range from 3.1°C to 2.0°C, which might have contributed to the substantial shortening of the time constants (0.18 and 0.13 hr for wake/REM sleep and NREM sleep, respectively), as they need to be faster to compensate for the reduced distance from the asymptote so that a similar increase/decrease temperature rate can be achieved.</p><fig id="fig2" position="float"><label>Figure 2.</label><caption><title>Results of models 1 and 2 with modulation of asymptotes.</title><p>(<bold>A</bold>).

To account for this modulation, we again applied a 24 hr sine-wave modulation onto the asymptotes. The combined effect of modulating the asymptotes according to prior wake-prevalence and circadian time (i.e., Model 2) almost flattened the residuals (residual RMS = 0.09°C; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2C</xref>) and further improved the fit (r = 0.96; RMS error = 0.26°C).

factors. To do so, we decomposed the simulated temperature signal into its three constituent factors by removing the circadian and/or prior wake-prevalence factors, and subtracting the respective result from the Model 2 output (see 'Materials and methods'). Consistent with the R<sup>2</sup> value of 83% achieved in Model 0, the factor sleep–wake state accounted for the largest portion of the variance, that is, 74% (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s1">Figure 3—figure supplement 1</xref>). Some of this explained variance was, however, shared with the other two factors in the model, that is, prior wake prevalence (27%) and circadian time (4%), leaving 42% as the unique contribution of the sleep–wake state. In comparison, the uniquely explained variance contributed by the prior wake prevalence and the circadian process were considerably smaller (12% and 2%, respectively). In total, the overall explained variance contributed by prior wake prevalence was 43% and by the circadian process 9%, of which 3% was shared.</p><p>In 5 of these 11 mice, we ran additional experiments with a similar design but shorter SD (2 and/or 4 hr, starting at ZT0) and only one day of recovery. To verify whether the parameters found in the main experiment were not overfitted to the specific experiment, we tested the performance of Model 2 in each of the additional recordings, using the individually optimized parameters from the 6 hr SD experiment (<xref ref-type="table" rid="table1">Table 1</xref>). The simulation proved to be robust for all the new recordings (all r values ≥0.91, and RMS errors ≤0.37), thus convincingly demonstrating the generalization of parameters within animals over time and across different experiments (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="supp3">Supplementary file 3</xref>).</p><p>Finally, given the high precision of the simulations, we inquired whether the algorithm could go beyond the simulations based on parameters adjusted specifically to an individual mouse. To this end, we used the median parameter values found previously (<xref ref-type="table" rid="table1">Table 1</xref>) to predict brain temperature in a different cohort of mice (n = 5) recorded in the context of another study. The experiment had the same 96 hr design as the current study, and none of those data were used to optimize the model parameters. To test the model without providing temperature data, and because the model is iterative, we needed to estimate the initial temperature (<italic>T</italic><sub>0</sub>) to start the first iteration. We first used the main dataset to associate the average temperature and the percentage of Wake/REM state in the first 7 min of recording by linear regression, and then estimated the <italic>T</italic><sub>0</sub> values in the current dataset based on wake/REM prevalence in the first 7 min (see 'Materials and methods', and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s1">Figure 4—figure supplement 1</xref>). After obtaining <italic>T</italic><sub>0</sub>, we used Model 2 to simulate the brain temperature of the independent cohort. Remarkably, all the correlation coefficients were between 0.93 and 0.95, although the median of the RMS error was 0.48°C since some recordings had consistent differences in absolute temperatures from physiological values, as was also observed in the main dataset (see columns 2-3 in <xref ref-type="table" rid="table1">Table 1</xref>). When we brought the empirical temperature data to the same average level as the predicted temperature traces (without changing scale), the median of the RMS error was reduced to 0.34°C and the fine overlap between predicted and observed temperature measures was again revealed (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4</xref>, and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s2">Figure 4—figure supplement 2</xref>). Repeating this process for the test group with the medians of the more basic models 0 and 1, yielded correlation coefficients in the 0.86–0.89 and 0.91–0.93 ranges, respectively.</p><fig-group><fig id="fig4" position="float"><label>Figure 4.</label><caption><title>Model fit to a novel dataset.</title><p>(<bold>A</bold>) Representative example of the Model 2 fit (orange) to novel raw data (blue) not used for optimization, using the median of the optimized parameters from the original dataset (<xref ref-type="table" rid="table1">Table 1</xref>).

The model showed a very accurate fit with data obtained under undisturbed baseline conditions, and during and following SD of varying lengths. It equally well predicted the global temperature dynamics on a time scale of hours and the changes following sleep–wake transitions on the order of seconds. In addition to two known factors modulating brain temperature, that is, the sleep–wake state and circadian influences, we identified a novel contributing factor involving the prior wake prevalence, which accounted for the up-regulation of brain temperature observed during periods of sustained wakefulness.</p><sec id="s3-1"><title>Model parameters</title><p>In mice kept under our experimental conditions, specifically a 25°C ambient temperature, a 12:12 hr light–dark cycle, housed singly, and <italic>food</italic> ad libitum, we observed a dynamic brain temperature range of a little over 3°C. However, at any given time of the experiment, the range of observed temperature fluctuations did not surpass 2°C. This range, delimited by the upper and lower asymptotes in the model, represents a homeostatically defended range within which the brain temperature can vary according to the animal’s behavior without eliciting a thermoregulatory response (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib40">Parmeggiani et al., 1975</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib43">Satinoff, 1983</xref>). Both asymptotes were modulated by two factors. The first was a time-of-day factor modeled by a sine wave, lowering and raising the defended temperature range with an amplitude of 0.19°C, reaching lowest levels close to the light period midpoint, that is, ZT5.4. Although we referred to this factor as ‘circadian’, given the experimental conditions, this fluctuation could also relate to the imposed light–dark cycle. Nevertheless, using a different analytical approach, our previous work in rats maintained under different photoperiods and under constant dark conditions arrived at very similar amplitudes for the time-of-day modulation of cortical temperature (0.13–0.21°C; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Franken et al., 1992b</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Franken et al., 1995</xref>), supporting the interpretation that the time-of-day factor does not depend on the lighting condition and is likely to represent a modulation of circadian origin.</p><p>The model identified a second factor dubbed ‘prior wake-prevalence’, that modulated the asymptotes of the defended temperature range. This factor differs considerably from the acute dependency of brain temperature on sleep–wake state transitions considered in Model 0 in that it integrates sleep–wake state information over several hours instead of minutes, thus suggesting a different underlying mechanism. Practically, it quantifies an up-regulation of the level at which temperature is regulated after sustained periods of wakefulness. Up-regulation of brain temperature during sustained wakefulness has been reported previously but was observed under conditions of SD spanning several weeks (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">Obermeyer et al., 1991</xref>). Because the prior wake-prevalence effect here was transient, and only involved a 3-hr time window, and was equally observed under baseline and sleep-deprivation conditions, the underlying mechanisms might not be the same. The maximal amplitude of the modulation of the asymptotes brought about by the prior wake-prevalence factor (i.e., the scaling parameter in <xref ref-type="table" rid="table1">Table 1</xref>), was about fivefold larger than that of the circadian modulation (1.01°C vs. 0.19°C), thus underscoring the importance of prior wake prevalence in determining brain temperature. Interestingly, the prior wake-prevalence effect affected the asymptotes 1.4 hr later. Although we are unable to provide a satisfactory explanation for this finding, delayed effects of sleep–wake state transitions have been reported in humans for body temperature (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Bunnell et al., 1988</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib55">Youngstedt et al., 1997</xref>), suggesting that the delay we observed in the mouse might relate to lagging peripheral effects affecting body temperature and, subsequently, brain temperature. Although we refer to this factor as prior wake-prevalence, it is equally plausible that the predominance of NREM sleep in a given interval drives the modulation. The onset of NREM sleep is associated with an active down-regulation of brain temperature involving peripheral vasodilation concomitant with decreased neural activity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Glotzbach and Heller, 1976</xref>). Therefore, the 3 hr time windows during which NREM sleep prevails might elicit a delayed net decrease in brain temperature involving peripheral mechanisms reminiscent of the slow physiological responses characteristic of sleep inertia in humans (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Kovac et al., 2020</xref>). Our current data do not lend themselves to identify this factor’s physiological substrate and needs further investigation.</p><p>The other optimized parameters were the time constants describing the changes in cortical temperature occurring at the sleep–wake transitions. Mathematically, a time constant value represents the time it will take to close ~63% of the gap between the current temperature and the asymptote, a duration that is constant regardless of the actual distance from the asymptote. To limit the number of free parameters in the model we did not differentiate between the rates of increase in wakefulness and REM sleep. Although this assumption is likely to be false (see, e.g., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Hoekstra et al., 2019</xref>), we reasoned that it would not impact the model’s performance significantly since REM sleep was relatively sparsely represented in our data (6% of recording time). The simulation identified time constants in the range of minutes for both the increases during wakefulness (and REM sleep) and the decreases in cortical temperature during NREM sleep. It also found longer time constants for the increase than for the decrease (13 and 7 min, respectively), pointing to a slower buildup of heat relative to its dissipation during NREM sleep. This difference is consistent with the concept that the blood that perfuses the brain acts as a heat sink, and that increases in temperature underestimate the rate of heat production since cooling occurs simultaneously (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Hayward and Baker, 1969</xref>).</p></sec><sec id="s3-2"><title>Explained variance</title><p>Using linear regression analysis between the hourly values of wakefulness and brain temperature, the sleep–wake state was reported to explain 84% of the variance in brain temperature (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Franken et al., 1992b</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Hoekstra et al., 2019</xref>). Although the overall fraction of the variance explained in the final iteration of our simulation was higher (91% in Model 2), the sleep–wake state factor explained less of the variance in brain temperature (74%; see <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s1">Figure 3—figure supplement 1</xref> for a summary). This discrepancy is due to the additional factors the model identified, primarily the prior wake-prevalence with which the sleep–wake state factor shared an important part of the explained variance. The linear regression results mentioned above should optimally be compared to the results of Model 0, in which only the sleep–wake state sequence was considered. In fact, Model 0 explained a very similar portion of the variance, that is, 83%. As suggested previously (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Franken et al., 1992b</xref>), the circadian factor carried surprisingly little information about brain temperature. Of the 9% of the variance that could be attributed to circadian modulation, most was redundant with that of the other two factors and only &lt;2% was uniquely circadian. In the model, both the circadian and prior wake-prevalence factors modulated the asymptotes. Consistent with the fivefold larger portion of variance explained by the latter, the maximum possible modulation of the asymptote was also fivefold larger.</p></sec><sec id="s3-3"><title>Comparison to previous models</title><p>Compared to our earlier effort to simulate brain temperature in the rat (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Franken et al., 1992b</xref>), we made a number of key modifications that enhanced the accuracy of the simulation. In the previous model, only the time constants were optimized but the estimates for the asymptotes were taken directly from the data. Moreover, the same time constants were used to simulate the increases and decreases in temperature accompanying sleep–wake state transitions. The current analysis showed that increase and decay rates differ considerably with a faster temperature decay in NREM sleep than the increase in wakefulness. Other factors estimated from the residuals in the original model were not formally optimized in one model simultaneously. The first such factor is the time-of-day (‘circadian’) modulation, whose amplitude was surprisingly similar in the two studies and species. Moreover, in the rat study, a down-regulation of the asymptote was needed to accurately fit the initial 12 hr of recovery because the actual temperature levels were lower than those predicted based on the sleep–wake distribution. This down-regulation after SD was not observed in the current study even when the prior wake-prevalence factor was not incorporated (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1</xref>). This difference could reflect a thermoregulatory response to the longer SD in the rat (24 hr vs. 6 hr in the mouse) or could result from the assumption of equal decay and increase rates, because during the recovery, time spent in NREM sleep was increased and in the current study NREM sleep was found to be associated with a faster decay rate. The final difference between the two studies is the considerably slower time constants in the rat (0.47 hr) compared to the mouse, which may be attributed to a species difference.</p><p>The differences between the simulations were probably also affected by the modifications we made to address previous criticism. As previously noted by others (e.g., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib52">Witting and Mirmiran, 1997</xref>), the sequential evaluation of the contribution of different factors may lead to an overestimation of those assessed first because shared (or redundant) variance will be added to the first but not the second. We addressed this problem by optimizing the parameters for the various factors simultaneously and by explicitly assessing the shared variance among factors. Another criticism concerned the use of hourly mean values to evaluate the model’s performance, since it removes a large portion of the variability and leads to inflated correlations (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Heller et al., 2011</xref>). We found no support for this criticism: performance assessed at a 4 s resolution yielded high correlations similar to the hourly values (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Franken et al., 1992b</xref>).</p></sec><sec id="s3-4"><title>Additional factors affecting brain temperature dynamics</title><p>Our simulation predicted brain temperature with high accuracy under the specific conditions of our study, but other factors affecting brain temperature could not be considered. For example, the efficacy with which blood removes heat from the brain depends on the ambient temperature (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Hayward and Baker, 1969</xref>), which was kept constant during experiments. Although brain temperature dynamics during sleep–wake state transitions seem qualitatively similar across a wide range of ambient temperatures (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Alföldi et al., 1990</xref>), it is nevertheless likely that the model parameters, and in particular the time constants, would need to be optimized for each ambient temperature. Moreover, increases in brain temperature accompanying intense activity such as wheel running (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Fuller et al., 1998</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Kunstetter et al., 2014</xref>), or activating stimuli such as a tail pinch or cage change (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Kiyatkin et al., 2002</xref>), cannot be captured by the current version of our model because we considered wakefulness to be a uniform brain state. Similarly, sleeping alone or in a group, or having access to a nest, will likely affect the dynamics of brain temperature during sleep through its impact on heat dissipation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Gordon, 2017</xref>). Although these refinements of the simulation are currently lacking, the model could be easily expanded to accommodate these factors, once experimental data are available.</p></sec><sec id="s3-5"><title>Brain vs. body temperature</title><p>Rhythms in temperature are generally considered a direct output of the circadian time-keeping system (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib41">Refinetti and Menaker, 1992</xref>). Our model showed, however, that the circadian contribution to brain temperature in the mouse is small and that the observed circadian rhythmicity in brain temperature under undisturbed conditions is driven primarily by the circadian sleep–wake distribution. Because circadian studies often rely on core body temperature measures, it remains unclear whether the model could predict changes in body temperature with similar precision. In rodents in general, body and brain temperatures change in parallel (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Blessing, 2018</xref>), suggesting that their gross dynamics are governed by similar rules and that the daily dynamics (e.g., hourly mean values) of body temperature can be predicted using assumptions similar to those in our model. However, at the finer time scale at which we optimized our model, the few available studies suggest that the temperatures of the brain and body behave differently (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">Ootsuka et al., 2009</xref>). One noticeable example of this is that body temperature does not increase during REM sleep (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Alföldi et al., 1990</xref>). Moreover, during extreme sleep disturbance (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">Obermeyer et al., 1991</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Baud et al., 2013</xref>) or thermal manipulations (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Donhoffer et al., 1959</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Kiley et al., 1984</xref>), brain and body temperatures can deviate considerably, suggesting that their underlying regulatory mechanisms differ. Therefore, the extent of the model’s accuracy in predicting changes in body temperature at small time scales should be tested experimentally.</p></sec><sec id="s3-6"><title>Implications</title><p>As the model can predict brain temperature dynamics with high accuracy even without optimization of the parameters in individual mice, a number of applications can be envisioned. For instance, neuroactive drugs do not only affect brain temperature (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Kiyatkin, 2018</xref>) but often also impact the sleep–wake state. By predicting the effects of the sleep–wake state on brain temperature, the model can isolate the direct effect of the intervention on brain temperature, that is, the residuals of the simulation that cannot be explained by the sleep–wake state. Second, brain temperature affects many properties of neuronal functioning (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Kiyatkin, 2010</xref>) and therefore may influence cognitive performance (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib50">Walter and Carraretto, 2016</xref>). Given the dynamics of brain temperature formulated by the model, it would be interesting to examine the putative associations between impaired cognitive functioning and distinctive thermoregulatory states, as has been observed during sleep inertia after awakening (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Kräuchi et al., 2004</xref>). This would require determining first of all whether brain temperature in humans is governed by similar rules. Although such data in humans are sparse, one study reported similar temperature dynamics to those in the mouse (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Landolt et al., 1995</xref>). The authors, however, reasoned that the underlying driving influence is circadian rather than the sleep–wake state, based on locomotor activity and NREM sleep depth arguments. Since studies in rodents have shown that both locomotor activity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib44">Shirey et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Hoekstra et al., 2019</xref>) and NREM sleep depth (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Franken et al., 1991</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib48">Tobler et al., 1994</xref>) only have a minimal association with brain temperature, brain temperature in humans might be driven by the sleep–wake distribution, consistent with the assumptions of our simulation.</p></sec></sec><sec id="s4" sec-type="materials|methods"><title>Materials and methods</title><sec id="s4-1"><title>Data acquisition</title><p>Detailed descriptions of the data acquisition, surgical procedures, and experimental design can be found elsewhere (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">Mang and Franken, 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Hoekstra et al., 2019</xref>) but is briefly described in this section. Data from 11 male C57BL6/J mice (seven wild types [WT]) and four lacking the gene encoding cold-inducible RNA-binding protein (<italic>Cirbp</italic> KO mice), 10–15 weeks of age were included. Sleep–wake distribution and brain temperature were unaltered in KO mice (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Hoekstra et al., 2019</xref>) and likewise the results reported here did not differ statistically between the two genotypes. All mice were housed individually under a 12:12 hr light–dark cycle with ZT0 and ZT12, corresponding to light onset and dark onset, respectively. Ambient temperature was maintained at 25°C and food and water were provided ad libitum. Electroencephalograms (EEGs), recorded from a frontal-parietal derivation, and electromyograms (EMGs), recorded from the neck muscles, were used to ‘score’ the sleep–wake states 'wakefulness', 'NREM sleep', and 'REM sleep', at a 4 s resolution. Sleep–wake states marked as having EEG artefacts were included in the temperature analyses. Brain temperature was measured by a thermistor placed on top of the right visual cortex corresponding to the midpoint of the frontal-parietal EEG electrode pair on the left hemisphere, and was sampled at 10 Hz and the median value for each 4 s epoch represented that epoch. Recordings lasted 96 hr, started at light onset, and included two 24 hr days serving as baseline (termed baseline 1 and baseline 2), 6 hr of SD starting at light onset on day 3, followed by an 18-hr (recovery 1) and a 24-hr (recovery 2) recovery period. SD was achieved by gentle handling (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">Mang and Franken, 2012</xref>). In addition to the main experiment above, a subset of five animals (1 WT and 4 KO mice) was subjected to a 2- and 4-hr SD following the same protocol as for the 6-hr SD experiment but without recovery 2 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Hubbard et al., 2020</xref>). One session was excluded due to a technical problem resulting in abrupt discontinuity of the temperature data. A final, independent cohort of five WT mice of the same strain, same sex, same age, and that underwent the same 4-day protocol with 6 hr SD, was used to test the predictions of the model. All experiments were approved by the Ethics Committee of the State of Vaud Veterinary Office Switzerland under license VD2743 and VD3201.</p></sec><sec id="s4-2"><title>Analysis</title><sec id="s4-2-1"><title>Model 0: optimization details</title><p>All code was programmed in Matlab and optimization used the <italic>fmincon</italic> function of the Optimization Toolbox, by minimizing the mean squared error between the simulated and recorded temperature signals. All free parameters were always optimized simultaneously, even when additional ones were added at later stages. For each animal, we constrained the base values of both asymptotes to the range of empirical temperature values plus a 2°C deviation in either direction. The upper and lower asymptotes were always defined as vectors with same size (86’400 4 s epochs) as the 96 hr experiment recordings. The code assumed 12:12 hr light–dark cycles, the start of recording at light onset, sleep scoring only included wake, NREM sleep and REM sleep states, and 48 hr of baseline.</p></sec><sec id="s4-2-2"><title>Model 1: modulation of asymptotes according to prior wake-prevalence</title><p>To modulate the asymptotes at each time point based on the preceding prevalence of the sleep–wake state (referred to as the ‘prior wake-prevalence’), for each time <italic>t</italic>, we calculated the fraction (0–1) of time spent in wake or REM sleep within a given time window ending at time <italic>t</italic>–1. We estimated temperature values for time points prior to the start of the recording (i.e., before the light onset of baseline 1), by averaging corresponding time points from the two days of baseline. Finally, we subtracted the averaged wake/REM fraction of total recording time (4 days) and multiplied by 2 so that the resulting values vary between –﻿1 and +1, and then multiplied the result by a scale factor to translate the fraction of time spent awake/REM sleep into a degree Celsius modulation of the asymptote. In addition, to enable the window not to end strictly at time <italic>t–</italic>1, we also implemented a window shift relative to time <italic>t</italic> by moving the produced vector back and forth in time. Since this shift was allowed in both directions and we could not predict values after the end of the recording, we assumed zero values (i.e., no modulation of the asymptotes). The outcome vector was added to both asymptotes.</p><p>In contrast to the window scale factor and all other free parameters in this study, which were continuous variables, the window size and window shift were discrete parameters that eventually translated into integer numbers of specific cell indices in a vector. Due to the requirement of the <italic>fmincon</italic> function for differentiability, to optimize these two parameters we applied a brute force method: (1) we defined possible values for each of the two variables, (2) for each unique combination of the values we ran the <italic>fmincon</italic> on the rest of the parameters and calculated the error, and (3) kept the parameters (continuous and discrete) that yielded the lowest error output. In this study we chose to test window size values between 0 and 10 hr (step size of 0.25 hr) and window shift values between −5.0 and +0.5 hr (increments of 0.1 hr). For none of the mice was the best fit obtained with parameter values at the limits of these defined ranges.</p></sec><sec id="s4-2-3"><title>Model 2: addition of circadian modulation of the asymptotes</title><p>To introduce a circadian modulation of the asymptotes we used the following formulas:<disp-formula id="equ3"><mml:math id="m3"><mml:mstyle displaystyle="true" scriptlevel="0"><mml:mrow><mml:msub><mml:mi>L</mml:mi><mml:mrow><mml:mi>t</mml:mi></mml:mrow></mml:msub><mml:mo>=</mml:mo><mml:msub><mml:mi>L</mml:mi><mml:mrow><mml:mi>t</mml:mi></mml:mrow></mml:msub><mml:mo>−</mml:mo><mml:mrow><mml:mi mathvariant="normal">s</mml:mi><mml:mi mathvariant="normal">i</mml:mi><mml:mi mathvariant="normal">n</mml:mi></mml:mrow><mml:mo stretchy="false">(</mml:mo><mml:mn>2</mml:mn><mml:mo>⋅</mml:mo><mml:mi>π</mml:mi><mml:mo>⋅</mml:mo><mml:mi>t</mml:mi><mml:mo>+</mml:mo><mml:mi>P</mml:mi><mml:mo stretchy="false">)</mml:mo><mml:mo>⋅</mml:mo><mml:mi>A</mml:mi></mml:mrow></mml:mstyle></mml:math></disp-formula><disp-formula id="equ4"><mml:math id="m4"><mml:mstyle displaystyle="true" scriptlevel="0"><mml:mrow><mml:msub><mml:mi>U</mml:mi><mml:mrow><mml:mi>t</mml:mi></mml:mrow></mml:msub><mml:mo>=</mml:mo><mml:msub><mml:mi>U</mml:mi><mml:mrow><mml:mi>t</mml:mi></mml:mrow></mml:msub><mml:mo>−</mml:mo><mml:mrow><mml:mi mathvariant="normal">s</mml:mi><mml:mi mathvariant="normal">i</mml:mi><mml:mi mathvariant="normal">n</mml:mi></mml:mrow><mml:mo stretchy="false">(</mml:mo><mml:mn>2</mml:mn><mml:mo>⋅</mml:mo><mml:mi>π</mml:mi><mml:mo>⋅</mml:mo><mml:mi>t</mml:mi><mml:mo>+</mml:mo><mml:mi>P</mml:mi><mml:mo stretchy="false">)</mml:mo><mml:mo>⋅</mml:mo><mml:mi>A</mml:mi></mml:mrow></mml:mstyle></mml:math></disp-formula>where <italic>A</italic> and <italic>P</italic> are the free parameters for optimization and stand for the amplitude and phase (in hours) of the sine wave, respectively. <italic>L<sub>t</sub></italic> and <italic>U<sub>t</sub></italic> are the lower and upper asymptote values at time <italic>t</italic>; hence, both asymptotes were changed in parallel and to the same extent.

Although the temperatures of most animals ranged between 34°C and 36°C, some recordings showed non-physiological lower (32–34°C) or higher (36–38°C) ranges (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Hoekstra et al., 2019</xref>), which probably resulted from technical problems. Nevertheless, the difference between the asymptote values was stable across animals (around 2°C), and simulation performance was high, regardless of the average absolute levels (<xref ref-type="table" rid="table1">Table 1</xref>). Therefore, to estimate the initial temperature when exclusively using the state sequence, we produced a predictive formula based on our existing data. First, we normalized the temperature data of each recording in the 96 hr experiment to a range between 34°C and 36°C. Then, we calculated the correlation between the percentage ‘occurrence’ of wake/REM sleep in a window at the start of the recording, and the average temperature in the same time window. In this way, we could reliably predict the temperature in the first minutes of the recording (r = 0.98, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s1">Figure 4—figure supplement 1</xref>), which we used as an estimated initial temperature. We chose a 7 min window size since it yielded the highest correlations across values between 1 and 10 min (analysis not shown).

The unique variance explained by each factor was then calculated as the ratio of the variance of each factor’s trace to the overall variance in the data.

Your article has been reviewed by three peer reviewers, one of whom is a member of our Board of Reviewing Editors, and the evaluation has been overseen by Catherine Dulac as the Senior Editor. The reviewers have opted to remain anonymous.</p><p>The reviewers have discussed the reviews with one another and the Reviewing Editor has drafted this decision to help you prepare a revised submission.</p><p>We would like to draw your attention to changes in our revision policy that we have made in response to COVID-19 (https://elifesciences.org/articles/57162). Specifically, we are asking editors to accept without delay manuscripts, like yours, that they judge can stand as <italic>eLife</italic> papers without additional data, even if they feel that they would make the manuscript stronger. Thus the revisions requested below only address clarity and presentation.</p><p>Summary:</p><p>Brain temperature is of neurobiological and clinical importance. The authors previously used a statistical approach to demonstrate that hourly brain-temperature values strongly co-varied with time-spent-awake, separate from locomotion. they now have developed a mathematical tool to simulate and predict mice cortical temperature based on the 4-second sleep-wake sequence. The model estimated temperature precisely with 91% of its variance based on three main factors: sleep-wake sequence, time-of-day (“circadian”), and a novel “prior wake prevalence”. With similar accuracy the model predicted temperature in a second, independent cohort using the parameters optimized for the first.</p><p>This manuscript tackles an important question of wake-sleep-dependent changes in brain temperature. The conventional view is that body temperature in mice is regulated by the circadian clock and it still often comes as a surprise to many that in fact the observed differences between day and night are primarily driven by the state of vigilance. The relationship between wakefulness and increased body temperature (or perhaps more correctly the relationship between sleep and hypothermia) has been established before, but the study of Sela et al. goes to great length to quantitatively describe the temperature dynamics. The authors conclude that model &quot;can help differentiate thermoregulatory from sleep-wake driven effects&quot;.</p><p>Essential revisions:</p><p>1) First, how vigilance state and sleep-wake history affect the relationship between the brain and body temperature remains unclear. Very few laboratories monitor brain temperature routinely, and the circadian field relies almost entirely on skin or core body temperature recording. Clearly, the authors do not have access to such data in the data set they used, but it is essential to be discussed. Are they independent? If the time constants were different, it could provide important insights into the underlying mechanisms and also functional significance.</p><p>2) To this end, while the effects of vigilance states on temperature dynamics are nicely documented, the underlying causes or biological significance of the effects observed remain unclear. The authors mention that &quot;Brain temperature affects many properties of neuronal functioning&quot;, but discussing some specific examples, illustrating which properties are actually influenced by changes within the temperature range investigated here, may help. Conversely, I am still not entirely clear what are the factors that actually drive the changes in brain temperature observed.</p><p>3) The observations made by the authors clearly apply to artificial laboratory conditions at a specific ambient temperature only, but it remains unclear how the vigilance state affects body/brain temperature at different ambient temperatures. Would you still observe vigilance-state specific changes in brain temperature if mice were kept at thermoneutrality? The authors optimise some specific parameters, such as &quot;window length&quot;, &quot;window shift&quot; or &quot;scaling factor&quot;, which helps to obtain a better fit, but then the question remains whether these would also work at different ambient temperatures, and what is their biological meaning.</p><p>4) Arguably, the actual temperature in the nest is higher than ambient temperature.

Important also because many labs indeed rely on body temperature measurements. We therefore have added a section to the Discussion addressing this matter (“Brain versus body temperature”).</p><p>The general time course of body and brain temperature changes in parallel (Blessing, 2018) suggesting their dynamics underlie similar rules such that sleep-wake state explains an important part of the variance in body temperature as well. We therefore anticipate that the daily dynamics of e.g. hourly mean values of body-temperature can be predicted using similar model assumptions, which could already be highly useful for circadian-related research questions. However, at the finer time-scales at which we optimized our model, the temperature of the brain and body deviate (Ootsuka et al., 2009) and e.g. body temperature does not increase during REM sleep (Alföldi et al., 1990). We are therefore not convinced that the more rapid changes in brain states will be able to predict body temperature changes and, vice versa, that other factors such as locomotion will influence body temperature much more than it does brain temperature (see point 5 below).</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>2) To this end, while the effects of vigilance states on temperature dynamics are nicely documented, the underlying causes or biological significance of the effects observed remain unclear.

Conversely, I am still not entirely clear what are the factors that actually drive the changes in brain temperature observed.</p></disp-quote><p>In the first paragraph of the Introduction, where we mentioned the biological significance of central temperature variation on brain function, we now have added specific examples as suggested. We also expanded the second paragraph of the Introduction to explain the factors thought to determine brain temperature.</p><p>Measured brain temperature is considered to result from the balance between heat production (brain metabolism) and heat dissipation (brain blood flow and the brain-to-blood temperature gradient; see revised second paragraph of the Introduction). Changes in sleep-wake state affect both heat production and dissipation: metabolism and oxygen consumption are increased during wakefulness and REM sleep relative to NREM sleep (Nir et al., 2013), blood flow to the brain is relatively increased (after correcting for the large drop in oxygen consumption during NREM sleep; McAvoy et al., 2019), and, as body temperature is actively down-regulated through peripheral vasodilation and perspiration at NREM sleep onset, also the brain-to-blood temperature gradient increases (Szymusiak, 2018). Accordingly, the simulation identified sleep-wake transitions to be the main driver of the observed changes in brain temperature over the 96h experiment, with as additional factors “prior wake-prevalence” and “circadian time”. As these 3 factors combined explain over 91% of the variance in brain temperature, we consider these to be main contributing factors.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>3) The observations made by the authors clearly apply to artificial laboratory conditions at a specific ambient temperature only, but it remains unclear how the vigilance state affects body/brain temperature at different ambient temperatures. Would you still observe vigilance-state specific changes in brain temperature if mice were kept at thermoneutrality? The authors optimise some specific parameters, such as &quot;window length&quot;, &quot;window shift&quot; or &quot;scaling factor&quot;, which helps to obtain a better fit, but then the question remains whether these would also work at different ambient temperatures, and what is their biological meaning.</p></disp-quote><p>Differences in ambient temperature modulate the efficacy with which the body dissipates heat to the environment, which, in turn, affects the temperature of the blood entering the brain (Hayward and Baker, 1969). Moreover, variations in ambient temperature strongly influence sleep-wake behavior (Kräuchi and Deboer, Front Biosci 2010). Nevertheless, brain-temperature dynamics at sleep-wake transitions remain surprisingly similar over a broad range of ambient temperatures (10-29°C), although the increase at the highest temperature seemed smaller, possibly related to the higher absolute cortical temperatures reached at this ambient temperature (Alfoldi et al., 1990). The parameters might therefore need to be adjusted according to ambient temperature so that predicted values will optimally fit. Since the basic dynamic of brain temperature between states is qualitatively preserved across different ambient temperatures, we estimate that the factors we incorporated in the model, including the parameters related to “prior wake prevalence” that the reviewer refers to, will be the same, although the parameter values might need to be re-optimized. We have now discussed these issues in the Discussion under the new section “Additional factors affecting brain temperature dynamics”. The biological significance of the “prior wake prevalence” factor was already discussed under the section “Model parameters” and has been elaborated on in the revised version.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>4) Arguably, the actual temperature in the nest is higher than ambient temperature. Is the drop in temperature during sleep smaller when the animal sleeps in the nest?</p></disp-quote><p>Nesting helps to keep the animal in a more comfortable thermal zone with less energy expenditure (Harding et al. Curr Opin Physiol 2020) and therefore “nest quality” decreases at higher ambient temperatures (Gordon, 2017). As discussed above, ambient temperature might produce quantitatively different dynamics and therefore the parameters will need to be re-optimized to take into account whether the animal sleeps inside or outside the nest. An equally important factor is whether mice sleep alone or in groups. We now have discussed these issues in the Discussion under the new section “Additional factors affecting brain temperature dynamics”.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>5) Finally, what is the relationship between locomotor activity and brain temperature? Does it matter if the animal is involved in an intense exploratory or running behaviour vs. relatively quiet wakefulness? Would the model work just as well in both cases?</p></disp-quote><p>It has been hypothesized that brain temperature is primarily determined by heat generated in skeletal muscles, which is carried from the periphery to the central nervous system by the bloodstream (Moser and Mathiesen, Neuroreport 1996). However, other studies reported very low, or even no, correlation of core body temperature with locomotor activity (Refinetti, Physiol Behav 1994, Weinert et al. Physiol Behav 1998, Hilmer et al. J Thermal Biol 2010). More specifically, in our previous work we directly examined the contribution of locomotor activity on brain temperature (Hoekstra et al., 2019) and found its contribution to be very modest (explaining ca. 2% of variance in brain temperature), in line with other studies (Shirey et al., 2015).</p><p>In the current experiment mice did not have access to running wheels and did not engage in intense locomotor activity maybe explaining why home cage locomotor activity does not notably contribute to brain temperature. Intense locomotor behavior may indeed modulate brain temperature. However, to capture also such changes in the model, wakefulness can no longer be treated as a unique state and an additional factor will have to be quantified and added to the simulation. We have discussed these issues in the Discussion under the new section “Additional factors affecting brain temperature dynamics”.</p></body></sub-article></article>
