presence of limiting deoxyribonucleotides. The <italic>Saccharomyces cerevisiae</italic> Rad53 (CHEK2 in mammals) checkpoint kinase plays a major role in cellular responses to DNA replication stress. Cell cycle regulated, genome-wide binding of Rad53 to chromatin was examined. Under replication stress, the kinase bound to sites of active DNA replication initiation and fork progression, but unexpectedly to the promoters of about 20% of genes encoding proteins involved in multiple cellular functions. Rad53 promoter binding correlated with changes in expression of a subset of genes. Rad53 promoter binding to certain genes was influenced by sequence-specific transcription factors and less by checkpoint signaling. However, in checkpoint mutants, untimely activation of late-replicating origins reduces the transcription of nearby genes, with concomitant localization of Rad53 to their gene bodies. We suggest that the Rad53 checkpoint kinase coordinates genome-wide replication and transcription under replication stress conditions.</p></abstract><kwd-group kwd-group-type="author-keywords"><kwd>origins of DNA replication</kwd><kwd>transcription start sites</kwd><kwd>gene promoters</kwd><kwd>Rad53</kwd><kwd>checkpoint kinase</kwd><kwd>stress response</kwd></kwd-group><kwd-group kwd-group-type="research-organism"><title>Research organism</title><kwd><italic>S. cerevisiae</italic></kwd></kwd-group><funding-group><award-group id="fund1"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100008732</institution-id><institution>Uehara Memorial Foundation</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>Postdoctoral Fellowship</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Kawaguchi</surname><given-names>Risa Karakida</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund2"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000057</institution-id><institution>National Institute of General Medical Sciences</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>GM45436</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Stillman</surname><given-names>Bruce</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund3"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000054</institution-id><institution>National Cancer Institute</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>P30-CA045508</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Stillman</surname><given-names>Bruce</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund4"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000092</institution-id><institution>National Library of Medicine</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>R01LM012736</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Gillis</surname><given-names>Jesse</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund5"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution>Goldring Family Foundation</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Stillman</surname><given-names>Bruce</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><funding-statement>The funders had no role in study design, data collection, and interpretation, or the decision to submit the work for publication.</funding-statement></funding-group><custom-meta-group><custom-meta specific-use="meta-only"><meta-name>Author impact statement</meta-name><meta-value>The localization of Rad53 cell cycle checkpoint kinase to many gene promoters and the dynamic changes in response to replication stress suggests that the kinase may coordinate genome stability and gene expression.</meta-value></custom-meta></custom-meta-group></article-meta></front><body><sec id="s1" sec-type="intro"><title>Introduction</title><p>Rad53, the homolog of the mammalian CHEK2 kinase present in the budding yeast <italic>Saccharomyces cerevisiae</italic>, is an essential kinase involved in a multitude of cellular processes. The most well-established function of Rad53 is its role as an effector kinase in response to various sources of DNA damage. To maintain genome stability during S-phase, a DNA replication checkpoint (DRC) is activated in response to replication stress via the sensor kinase Mec1 (the mammalian ATM/ATR), the replication fork protein Mrc1 (Claspin in mammals), and other fork proteins (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Lanz et al., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">Osborn and Elledge, 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">Pardo et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">Paulovich and Hartwell, 1995</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">Saldivar et al., 2017</xref>). A second DNA damage checkpoint mediated by Rad9 (TP53BP1 in mammals) responds to double strand DNA breaks. Both branches converge on the effector kinase Rad53, which triggers a wide range of downstream events, including slowing or halting cell cycle progression, transiently preventing initiation of DNA replication at origins that have not yet replicated, activating DNA repair pathways and elevating the synthesis of deoxyribonucleoside triphosphates (dNTPs) by upregulating genes encoding the ribonucleotide reductase (RNR). The checkpoint signaling also promotes widespread changes in gene expression (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Jaehnig et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">Pardo et al., 2017</xref>).</p><p>Unlike most of the checkpoint genes, both Mec1 and Rad53 kinases are essential for cell viability in unperturbed cells. This can be partly explained by their role in regulating dNTP pools (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Desany et al., 1998</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Forey et al., 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib54">Zhao et al., 2000</xref>). However, under the bypass conditions in cells without Sml1, the inhibitor of the RNR enzyme, cells lacking either kinases are viable. Yet, it is important to note that these kinase-null mutants are extremely sick and sensitive to various types of exogenous stress. Furthermore, lacking Rad53 causes a more severe defect than lacking Mec1, implying that Rad53 has activities beyond checkpoint signaling. Consistent with this suggestion, the kinase-deficient mutant <italic>rad53<sup>K227A</sup></italic> lacks checkpoint function but retains growth-associated activity and an additional <italic>rad53</italic> mutation was found that is checkpoint proficient but supports cell growth poorly (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Gunjan and Verreault, 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Hoch et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Holzen and Sclafani, 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">Pellicioli et al., 1999</xref>).</p><p>Rad53 is central to the transcriptional response to DNA damage. It is well established that the Dun1 protein kinase acts downstream of Rad53 to phosphorylate and inactivate the transcriptional repressor Rfx1/Crt1 and thereby upregulate target genes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Huang et al., 1998</xref>), including <italic>RNR2</italic>, <italic>RNR3</italic>, and <italic>RNR4</italic>, encoding subunits of RNR. However, the induced expression of <italic>RNR1</italic>, which encodes the major isoform of the RNR large subunit, is not controlled by the Rfx1 repressor, but by Ixr1 binding to the <italic>RNR1</italic> promoter upon genotoxic stress (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib51">Tsaponina et al., 2011</xref>). This Ixr1-dependent regulation of <italic>RNR1</italic> is independent of Dun1 but requires Rad53. Another Rad53-dependent, Dun1-independent regulation of <italic>RNR1</italic> involves dissociation of the Nrm1 repressor from MBF following Nrm1 phosphorylation by Rad53 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib50">Travesa et al., 2012</xref>). Thus, the Rad53-dependent transcription control is complex, but not yet fully understood.</p><p>In addition to upregulating the dNTP pools, defects in cells lacking Rad53 can be suppressed by manipulating factors functioning in transcription regulation, cell wall maintenance, proteolysis, and cell cycle control (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Desany et al., 1998</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Manfrini et al., 2012</xref>). Moreover, Rad53 kinase targets and interaction partners found in biochemical and proteomic studies suggest that the kinase is pleiotropic (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Gunjan and Verreault, 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Jaehnig et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Lao et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib47">Smolka et al., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib46">Smolka et al., 2006</xref>).</p><p>In this study, while investigating the response of yeast cells to replication stresses caused by depletion of dNTPs, we found that Rad53 localized to more than 20% of gene promoters in the <italic>S. cerevisiae</italic> genome, suggesting a multifaceted role in coordinating stress responses. Furthermore, we provide evidence that in the absence of the DRC checkpoint pathway, untimely activation of replication from late origins can negatively affect transcription activity of nearby genes.</p></sec><sec id="s2" sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><sec id="s2-1"><title>Rad53 is recruited to genomic loci other than replication origins in proliferating yeast cells</title><p>Previous studies focusing on specific genomic features, mainly subsets of DNA replication origins, have detected Rad53 binding to replication origins and replication forks (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Can et al., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Dohrmann and Sclafani, 2006</xref>). However, given the evidence that Rad53 has functions beyond the control of DNA replication stress, it is possible that Rad53 also functions at additional genomic loci. We therefore investigated the genome-wide distribution of Rad53 by chromatin immunoprecipitation and deep sequencing (ChIP-seq) in proliferating yeast cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Behrouzi et al., 2016</xref>). Since the <italic>sml1</italic> null mutation (<italic>sml1Δ</italic>) allows cells to bypass the requirement for Rad53, or its upstream kinase Mec1, for growth, we also performed ChIP-seq in the <italic>sml1Δ</italic> mutant and the <italic>rad53 null</italic> (<italic>rad53Δ sml1Δ</italic>) as controls for antibody specificity (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1</xref>).</p><fig id="fig1" position="float"><label>Figure 1.</label><caption><title>Rad53 is recruited to genomic loci other than replication origins in proliferating yeast cells.</title><p>(<bold>a</bold>) Coverage tracks of Rad53 ChIP-seq signals in <italic>WT</italic>, <italic>sml1Δ</italic>, <italic>rad53Δsml1Δ</italic>, and <italic>mec1Δ sml1Δ</italic> for chromosome III.

Rad53 binding to the same sites also occurred in the <italic>sml1Δ</italic> mutant and the <italic>mec1Δ sml1Δ</italic> mutant, but was absent in the <italic>rad53Δ sml1Δ</italic> mutant. Computational analysis was performed to generate heatmaps of Rad53 ChIP-seq signal across 2-kb intervals centered on transcription start sites (TSSs) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1b</xref>). The average Rad53 ChIP-seq signal on top of the heatmap show that Rad53 was most concentrated within 500-bp upstream of TSSs in <italic>WT</italic>, <italic>sml1Δ</italic>, and <italic>mec1Δ sml1Δ</italic> mutants. A smaller fraction of genes also have signal within the gene bodies. No Rad53 signal beyond background was detected at TSSs in the <italic>rad53Δ sml1Δ</italic> cells, demonstrating antibody specificity. Analysis by calculating empirical p values for the ChIP-seq signals 500-bp upstream of TSS found that, out of 6604 genes, 1464, 1983, and 1293 in <italic>WT</italic>, <italic>sml1Δ</italic>, and <italic>mec1Δ sml1Δ</italic>, respectively, exhibited significant Rad53 signal at this region. This represents ~20% or greater of all gene promoters.</p><p>Heatmap analysis was also performed on Rad53 ChIP-seq signal across 30-kb intervals centered on all origins annotated in the OriDB database (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib45">Siow et al., 2012</xref>). The average signal across the whole region was higher in <italic>WT</italic>, <italic>sml1Δ</italic>, and <italic>mec1Δ sml1Δ</italic> than in <italic>rad53Δ sml1Δ</italic> after normalization (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1c</xref>). However, the signal was not concentrated at the origins. Since these ChIP-seq datasets are from asynchronous cells, this finding is consistent with the idea that recruitment of Rad53 to replication origins is cell cycle regulated rather than constant binding to origins.</p></sec><sec id="s2-2"><title>Binding of Rad53 to upstream TSS changes with cell cycle stages</title><p>To gain insight into the dynamics of Rad53 recruitment to genomic loci such as promoters and replication origins, Rad53 ChIP-seq was analyzed in samples from synchronized cell cultures. Cells were arrested in G1 using α-factor and then released into media containing hydroxyurea (HU) to induce replication stress caused by limiting dNTPs. Three stages of synchronous cell cultures were collected and referred to as G1 (for cells arrested in G1), HU45 and HU90 (for cells released from G1 into HU for 45 and 90 min, respectively). These cell samples were then processed for ChIP-seq analysis. Heatmaps of the Rad53 signals at 2-kb intervals centered on all TSSs show a trend of increasing Rad53 binding as cells progress from G1-phase into HU45 or HU90 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2a</xref>), concomitant with increased levels of Rad53 protein in cells treated with HU (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s1">Figure 2—figure supplement 1</xref>). The increase in Rad53 parallels entry into S-phase, as measured by Orc6 phosphorylation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s1">Figure 2—figure supplement 1a</xref>). Similar to the data from asynchronous cell samples, Rad53 signals were most concentrated upstream of TSSs (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2a</xref>, left panel). The ChIP-seq signals using antibodies against γ-H2A, which like Rad53 is a target of the sensor kinase Mec1, were not enriched upstream of TSSs (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2a</xref>, right panel). In fact, the signals for γ-H2A were lower immediately upstream of TSSs than the surrounding regions, consistent with promoters being histone-free regions.</p><fig-group><fig id="fig2" position="float"><label>Figure 2.</label><caption><title>Rad53 is recruited to transcription start site (TSS) and the binding changes with the cell cycle stage.</title><p>Cells were synchronized in G1 phase and released into YPD containing 0.2M hydroxyurea (HU) for 45 and 90min (HU45 and HU90, respectively).

The distribution of aggregated peak numbers around TSSs showed highest count numbers immediately upstream of the TSS (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2b</xref>). By visual inspection of normalized ChIP-seq coverage tracks, we noticed that signals at promoters of genes such as <italic>RNR1</italic>, <italic>PCL1</italic>, and <italic>TOS6</italic> varied depending on the cell cycle stage (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2c</xref>, bottom three tracks for <italic>WT</italic> at stages of G1, HU45, and HU90) while signals at neighboring gene promoters remained largely constant. Thus, the recruitment of Rad53 to a subset of gene promoters is regulated. Because <italic>RNR1</italic>, <italic>PCL1</italic>, and <italic>TOS6</italic> are known targets of the cell cycle regulator SBF, a sequence-specific transcription factor composed of subunits Swi4 and Swi6, we compared Rad53 ChIP-seq data and a previous ChIP-seq dataset of Swi6 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Park et al., 2013</xref>). As indicators for the gene specificity of protein binding, the Gini indices were computed from Lorenz curves of ChIP-seq data for Swi6 and two of our Rad53 replicates (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2d</xref>), being 0.763, 0.2918, and 0.2982, respectively. Rad53 has a coverage for many promoters while Swi6 shows substantially high coverage only for a limited number of promoters. Thus, it is likely Rad53 would effect a wider range of genes than the Swi6 regulatory network.</p><p>Previous studies have found that under certain conditions, regions of the genome are promiscuously present in ChIP-seq studies independent of the antibody used (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Park et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib49">Teytelman et al., 2013</xref>). These regions were termed hyper-ChIPable regions and were found enriched for sequences in and around gene bodies of highly expressed genes. We therefore examined whether these regions were promiscuously present under our conditions. Analysis of ChIP-seq data for Rad53 and γ-H2A with or without the hyper-ChIPable regions observed by Teytelman et al. and Park et al. did not alter the pattern of Rad53 binding to TSSs (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s2">Figure 2—figure supplement 2a–d</xref>). When we specifically examined the pattern of Rad53 ChIP-seq signals around TSSs of the 296 genes associated with those hyper-ChIPable sequences, we observed not only localization to TSSs, but also enrichment to the gene bodies as previously reported (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Park et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib49">Teytelman et al., 2013</xref>). This pattern is distinct from the pattern of promoter localization (compare <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s2">Figure 2—figure supplement 2d, e</xref>). Furthermore, KEGG analysis of the genes enriched in the studies by Teytelman et al. and Park et al. showed predominantly genes encoding snoRNAs and tRNAs, genes we did not find in the promoter binding for Rad53 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s2">Figure 2—figure supplement 2f</xref>). Finally, we did not observe any enrichment at gene promoters when the <italic>RAD53</italic> gene was deleted from the strain (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1a, b</xref>) or when anti-γ-H2A antibodies were used (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2a</xref>). Thus, we suggest that the Rad53 binding observed here is not the same as the promiscuous, non-specific enrichment of hyper-ChIPable regions reported previously. Moreover, Rad53 binding to a subset of promoters is transcription factor dependent (see below).</p></sec><sec id="s2-3"><title>Rad53 is recruited to sites of DNA synthesis independent of checkpoint signaling</title><p>Since previous studies reported localization of Rad53 to replication origins (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Can et al., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Dohrmann and Sclafani, 2006</xref>), we also performed heatmap analysis of ChIP-seq signal around replication origins for Rad53, γ-H2A, and Cdc45, a component of active helicase complex and hence the marker for active replication forks (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s3">Figure 2—figure supplement 3</xref>). The 30-kb window for the heatmap around origins was chosen based on our prior knowledge that the extent of DNA synthesis in <italic>WT</italic> cells under similar growth conditions at HU90 was about 10 kb (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib42">Sheu et al., 2014</xref>). In <italic>WT</italic> cells, the Rad53 signal was present at regions associated with early firing origins but not with late firing origins that are inactive due to inhibition by the HU-induced checkpoint. However, Rad53 signal was also present at late origins in the kinase-deficient <italic>rad53<sup>K227A</sup></italic> and <italic>mrc1Δ</italic> mutants, both of which allow activation of late origins as a result of the checkpoint defect. Thus, Rad53 was recruited only to replication forks associated with activated origins and the pattern was similar to that of Cdc45. Surprisingly, Rad53 binding to replication forks did not require Mrc1 or its own kinase activity, suggesting checkpoint-independent recruitment of Rad53 to sites of DNA synthesis.</p><p>Interestingly, γ-H2A was observed at genomic regions surrounding the very late origins in G1-phase in both <italic>WT</italic> and mutants (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s3">Figure 2—figure supplement 3b</xref>).

Overall, most of the downregulated genes in cluster 1 of this group were situated very close to active origins (&lt;2 kb between origin center and TSS, light purple marks and &lt;1 kb, dark purple marks). Interestingly, the pattern of marks for origin to TSS distance largely mirrored the patten of the Rad53 ChIP signal within the gene bodies (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6b, c</xref>). This correlation pattern was not found in the <italic>WT</italic> ChIP heatmaps.</p><p>To explore the functional relationship between replication origins and genes, we summarized the ratio of up- and downregulated DEGs from the HU45 (<italic>mrc1Δ</italic> vs. <italic>WT</italic>) comparison in terms of the category of their relation to the closest origins (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6d</xref>). In the first category, we parsed this DEG group according to the range of distance between TSS and closest origins (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6d</xref>, left panels). Within this DEG group, genes situated 5 kb or more away from the closest active origins were similarly distributed between up- and downregulation of gene expression. However, for those genes that are closer to an active origin (&lt;5 kb), the bias toward downregulated genes increased. For those genes situated less than 1 kb away from active origins, more than 80% were downregulated. In the second category, we grouped the DEGs according to the type origin the TSS was closest to. The DEGs that are more than 5 kb away from any annotated origins were labeled ‘none’ in origin type (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6d</xref>, middle panels) and similarly distributed between up- and downregulation as expected from the above analysis. However, more downregulated genes were found when the nearby origins were active (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6d</xref>, origin type late or early). The bias was stronger for genes that were close to late origins, which become active in HU when Mrc1 was absent (86% and 71% downregulated when genes were close to late and early origins, respectively, Fisher’s exact test p = 0.012). Because late origins and intermediate early origins were more active in the <italic>mrc1Δ</italic> mutant, it is possible that nearby gene expression was negatively affected by active DNA synthesis. In the third category, we examined the effect of relative gene–origin orientation. We found that the bias toward the downregulation was stronger when the nearby origin (&lt;5 kb away) was in a HO orientation than in a CD orientation toward the gene (86% and 67% downregulated for HO and CD sets, respectively, Fisher’s exact test p = 0.0019) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6d</xref>, right panels). Thus, untimely activation of DNA replication origins in the checkpoint mutants affects gene expression concomitant with Rad53 binding to gene bodies.</p></sec><sec id="s2-7"><title>Rad53-binding changes coincide with the changes in gene expression for targets of cell cycle regulators SBF and MBF</title><p>Two clusters from the gene coexpression analysis of DEGs in the <italic>WT</italic>(G1 → HU45) comparison showed a significant correlation between Rad53 binding and gene expression (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5c, d</xref>, clusters 1 and 7). These two clusters contain genes that encode targets of SBF and MBF, key transcription factor complexes comprised of a shared regulatory subunit, Swi6 and the DNA-binding subunits Swi4 and Mbp1, respectively (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Breeden, 2003</xref>).

Evidence suggests that SBF and MBF are directly regulated by Rad53 kinase and Rad53 may regulate expression of targets of Msn4, Swi6, Swi4, and Mbp1 through Dun1-independent mechanisms (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Jaehnig et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Bastos de Oliveira et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib44">Sidorova and Breeden, 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib50">Travesa et al., 2012</xref>).

Among the 81 genes that are candidate targets for both Swi4 and Swi6, 36 genes were found in the 236 DB/DEGs (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figures 3b</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">5c</xref>) with an increase of frequency from 1.18% to 15.25% (p &lt; 1E−15). Scatter plot comparisons of Rad53-binding and gene expression changes of these 36 genes show a clear positive correlation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7a</xref>, SBF top panel). Comparing with data from the checkpoint mutant samples, we found that most of these SBF target genes showed a similar profile of differential expression, from G1 to HU, in the <italic>rad9Δ</italic> mutant to that in <italic>WT</italic> (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7b</xref>).

Therefore, the targets of Ste12, a key transcription factor activated by MAPK signaling to regulate genes involved in mating or pseudohyphal/invasive growth pathways were investigated. Of 183 potential targets of Ste12 annotated in SGD, 34 were in the 236 DB/DEGs group (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figures 5c</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">7a</xref>). All the Ste12 targets that have decreased Rad53 binding were downregulated as cells entered S-phase. Moreover, 20 out of the 34 Ste12 targets in the top DB group showed increased Rad53 binding in HU and 11 of these 20 genes were also targets of SBF. Thus, regulation by SBF may be responsible for the correlation between increased Rad53 binding at the promoter and upregulation of these target genes.</p></sec><sec id="s2-8"><title>SBF is a key factor for recruitment of Rad53 to the promoters of its target genes under replication stress condition</title><p>To determine the contribution of various transcription regulators in recruitment of Rad53 to gene promoters, we performed Rad53 ChIP-seq experiments for <italic>WT</italic>, <italic>ixr1Δ</italic>, <italic>swi4Δ</italic>, and <italic>swi6Δ</italic> mutants (experiment TF).

Unexpectedly, we found that Rad53 bound to about 20% of the gene promoters in the yeast genome. These genes encode proteins with diverse functions, including various aspects of cell cycle, metabolism, protein modification, ion transport, cell wall organization, and cell growth. There is a general trend of increasing Rad53 level during the G1- to S-phase transition in the presence of HU (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figures 2a</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">3a</xref>). Remarkably, Rad53 binding at promoters for genes such as <italic>RNR1</italic>, <italic>RNR3</italic>, and <italic>TOS6</italic> increases substantially beyond the general trend (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figures 2c</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">3c</xref>). In contrast, Rad53 binding decreased at promoters of genes involved in response to mating pheromone as cells exited from α-factor-induced G1 arrest into the cell division cycle. The prevalent and dynamic changes in Rad53 promoter-bound levels in cells replicating in HU did not necessarily depend on checkpoint signaling activated by HU, for example, at genes like <italic>PCL1</italic> and <italic>YOX1</italic>. But in some cases, such as <italic>RNR1</italic>, the increase in Rad53 levels was reduced in checkpoint mutants (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s4">Figure 2—figure supplement 4</xref>). Furthermore, the Mrc1 checkpoint mediator, Mec1 sensor kinase, and kinase activity of Rad53 itself are not absolutely required for the recruitment of Rad53 to gene promoters (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1b</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s1">Figure 4—figure supplement 1</xref>). The binding of Rad53 to numerous promoters in the yeast genome suggests a previously unappreciated level of transcription regulation that is coordinated with the many cellular processes, such as normal DNA replication, and induced cellular stresses to which Rad53 responds.</p><p>The conditions employed in this study, cell cycle entry in the presence of HU, may determine the nature of the genes that display dynamic binding of Rad53 to gene promoters. It is known that Rad53 phosphorylates transcription factors such as the SBF and MBF subunit Swi6 and the MBF corepressor Nrm1 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Bastos de Oliveira et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib44">Sidorova and Breeden, 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib50">Travesa et al., 2012</xref>) and that Irx1 controls transcription of <italic>RNR1</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib51">Tsaponina et al., 2011</xref>). Removal of Swi4, Swi6 or Ixr1 reduced, and in some cases eliminated Rad53 binding to promoters of genes controlled by these transcription factors. We also found Rad53 bound to the <italic>NRM1</italic> promoter, which is also in the top DB group, suggesting an additional regulation of cell cycle-dependent transcription control by Rad53. Rad53 also bound to promoters of genes encoding histones and all histone genes were upregulated DEGs in the HU45 (<italic>rad53<sup>K227A</sup></italic> vs. <italic>WT</italic>) comparison (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6s1">Figure 6—figure supplement 1</xref>), suggesting that, in addition to its known role in histone degradation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Gunjan and Verreault, 2003</xref>), Rad53 may control histone level through gene expression. This is consistent with previous findings that Rad53 targets Yta7 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib46">Smolka et al., 2006</xref>), which interacts with FACT to regulate histone gene expression and inhibits Spt21<sup>NPAT</sup>-regulated histone genes expression (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Bruhn et al., 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Gradolatto et al., 2008</xref>). In the absence of Rad53 protein, histone levels become elevated, causing global effects on gene expression (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Bruhn et al., 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib51">Tsaponina et al., 2011</xref>).</p><p>Our data are consistent with the possibility that the Rad53 protein contributes to the transcriptional regulation as a structural component by binding directly to promoters or transcriptions factors bound to these promoters, as previously suggested for several MAP kinases (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Alepuz et al., 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Kim et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib40">Sanz et al., 2018</xref>). Like the stress-induced kinase Hog1, Rad53 binding to promoters may be dynamic in other stress conditions, which is under investigation. A major unanswered question is how Rad53 binds to so many diverse promoter sites. We suggest that it may bind DNA directly or to a common factor that is present at the promoters of Rad53-bound genes. Alternatively, certain chromatin features common to these promoters may facilitate Rad53 recruitment. It remains possible that, in addition to transcriptional regulation, Rad53 may be recruited to promoter region preemptively to ensure integrity of vulnerable chromatin associated with active transcription. Pre-targeting repair complexes to open chromatin where they are poised for lesion recognition and repair has been reported in human cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Bacolla et al., 2021</xref>).</p><p>In cells, the same DNA template is used for both replication and transcription, potentially creating conflicts between replication and transcription that can lead to detrimental effects on genome stability and cell viability (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Hamperl and Cimprich, 2016</xref>). Thus, it is important that cells employ mechanisms to avoid, tolerate and resolve such conflicts. It is known that late-replicating genes are tethered to the nuclear pore complexes in the nuclear periphery and checkpoint signaling, including Rad53 kinase, is required for preventing topological impediments for replication fork progression (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Bermejo et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Hamperl and Cimprich, 2016</xref>). Moreover, during normal replication, Mec1 may locally activate Rad53 to deal with difficult to replicate loci or regions of replication–transcription conflict without triggering full blown checkpoint activation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Bastos de Oliveira et al., 2015</xref>).</p><p>Eukaryotic cells initiate DNA synthesis in a temporally controlled manner from multiple replication origins to ensure efficient duplication of the genome (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Bell and Labib, 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">Renard-Guillet et al., 2014</xref>). One of the main consequences of checkpoint activation is inhibition of late origin firing (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib48">Tercero et al., 2003</xref>). However, in the checkpoint mutants, these late origins become active and we found that Rad53 was recruited to the body of origin-proximal genes. Concomitantly, gene expression of these genes was reduced, perhaps mediated by recruitment of Rad53. While checkpoint signaling pathways are known to regulate gene expression, it is possible that untimely activation of the late origins results in a replication–transcription conflict and contribute to downregulation of genes in these checkpoint mutants. We suggest that the normal temporal order of replication of genes in the genome throughout S-phase, and possibly the order of transcription of genes, have evolved to prevent conflicts between replication and transcription, which is particularly important in a gene dense genome such as <italic>S. cerevisiae</italic>.</p></sec><sec id="s4" sec-type="materials|methods"><title>Materials and

For ChIP-seq residual analysis, we used simple normalization. In this process, each case sample was compared with the corresponding control sample of DNA input to compute log2 fold changes within each 25-bp window reciprocally scaled by multiplying the total read counts of another sample. Then, the average of fold changes was computed for each duplicate. For ChIP-seq heatmap analysis, we employed the origin-aware normalization to account for the higher background around origin region as a result of DNA replication. In the origin-aware normalization, the same computation used in simple normalization, or log2 fold change with scaling by the total read count, is independently applied for the region proximal to the origins and others. For the heatmap presented in this paper, the origin-proximal region is defined as the region within 5000-bp upstream and downstream.</p></sec><sec id="s4-11"><title>Heatmap analyses at origins and TSS</title><p>After the average fold change computation and normalization from ChIP-seq signals, the signal strength is visualized around the target regions such as TSSs and replication origins are extracted using normalizeToMatrix function in EnrichedHeatmap (window size is 25 bp and average mode is w0). We ordered heatmaps to examine a different signal enrichment pattern for the characteristics of each origin or gene. For the heatmap row of each origin is ordered by the assigned replication timing for ChIP-seq signals around replication origins. The replication time for the origins are annotated with the replication timing data published previously (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib53">Yabuki et al., 2002</xref>). From the estimated replication time for each 1000-bp window, we extracted the closest window from the center of each replication origin and assigned it as the representative replication timing if their distance is no more than 5000 bp. Early and late origins groups are categorized according to the definition of the origin types using the replication profile data from this study. The final set of the replication origins used in the heatmap analysis are obtained after filtering out the replication origins overlapped with any of 238 hyper-ChIPable regions defined in the previous study (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib49">Teytelman et al., 2013</xref>). In total, 167 early and 231 late origins pass this filter and are used in the heatmaps analysis in this study. For heatmaps of the ChIP-seq signals around TSS, we ordered genes based on RNA-seq fold changes for all DEGs or per coexpression cluster of DEGs based on gene coexpression network constructed in CoCoCoNet (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Lee et al., 2020</xref>).</p></sec><sec id="s4-12"><title>ChIP-seq residual analysis</title><p>To detect the time-dependent increase or decrease of Rad53-binding signals, we first focused on the 500-bp window upstream from each TSS (defined as promoter region) and computed the sum of the fold change signals estimated for each 25-bp window scaled by the window size as an activity of Rad53 binding for each gene. The overall activity scores are varied for each time point probably because of the different Rad53 protein level or other batch-specific reasons. To adjust such sample-specific differences for a fair comparison, a linear regression is applied for the activity scores of all genes between G1 and other time points HU45 and HU90 using lm function in R. Then we selected top genes showing the deviated signals from the overall tendency according to the absolute residual values between the actual and predicted values, excluding the genes with signal value lower than −0.075 after scaling the maximal signal to 1. Top 1000 genes with the highest absolute residual values were selected from two independent experiments. The 435 DB genes identified in both experiments (435 top DB overlap) were selected for further analysis.</p></sec></sec></body><back><sec sec-type="additional-information" id="s5"><title>Additional information</title><fn-group content-type="competing-interest"><title>Competing interests</title><fn fn-type="COI-statement" id="conf1"><p>No competing interests declared</p></fn><fn fn-type="COI-statement" id="conf2"><p>No competing interests declared</p></fn><fn fn-type="COI-statement" id="conf3"><p>Reviewing editor, <italic>eLife</italic></p></fn></fn-group><fn-group content-type="author-contribution"><title>Author contributions</title><fn fn-type="con" id="con1"><p>Conceptualization, Resources, Data curation, Formal analysis, Validation, Investigation, Visualization, Methodology, Writing - original draft, Writing – review and editing</p></fn><fn fn-type="con" id="con2"><p>Data curation, Software, Formal analysis, Investigation, Writing – review and editing</p></fn><fn fn-type="con" id="con3"><p>Conceptualization, Data curation, Software, Formal analysis, Supervision, Funding acquisition, Investigation, Methodology, Writing – review and editing</p></fn><fn fn-type="con" id="con4"><p>Conceptualization, Data curation, Formal analysis, Supervision, Funding acquisition, Investigation, Methodology, Writing - original draft, Project administration, Writing – review and editing</p></fn></fn-group><fn-group content-type="ethics-information"><title>Ethics</title><fn fn-type="other"><p>This study used animals for antibody production and all studies were performed in strict accordance with the recommendations in the Guide for the Care and Use of Laboratory Animals of the National Institutes of Health.

What follows is the decision letter after the first round of review.]</p><p>Thank you for submitting the paper &quot;Prevalent and Dynamic Binding of the Cell Cycle Checkpoint Kinase Rad53 to Gene Promoters&quot; for consideration by <italic>eLife</italic>. Your article has been reviewed by 3 peer reviewers, and the evaluation has been overseen by a Reviewing Editor and a Senior Editor. The following individual involved in review of your submission has agreed to reveal their identity: Miles A Pufall (Reviewer #2).</p><p>Comments to the Authors:</p><p>We are sorry to say that, after consultation with the reviewers, we have decided that this work will not be considered further for publication by <italic>eLife</italic>.</p><p>After discussing the manuscript, the reviewers and the reviewing editor concluded that while the paper reports a series of interesting observations related to Rad53 binding to gene promoters independent of checkpoint signaling, the reviewers found the main message of the paper to be unclear. The paper starts with an attempt to look at RAD53 binding to replicons, but finds binding of RAD53 to promoter sites in G1 and in the absence of replication stress. Despite this intriguing observation, the results are analyzed with respect to stressed replication. As a result, the paper does not address reasons or consequences of the observed phenotype other than transcription/replication collisions.</p><p>From a technical point of view, all reviewers were concerned with the lack of statistics to draw inferences regarding the central question: Does Rad53 coordinate both replication and transcription in response to stress, and do the mutants disrupt this coordination. While it is often useful, to note a trend that is worth exploring, where numbers are available the validity of these inferences must be drawn to strengthen the conclusions.</p><p><italic>Reviewer #1:</italic></p><p>Strength: Upon first reading of the abstract, there was some concern that the observed Rad53 ChIP-seq at promoters could be related to the &quot;expression bias&quot; previously reported in ChIP-seq data sets, where false peaks were observed at some highly-expressed genes, even for exogeneous non-DNA binding proteins. The authors' analyses, especially lines 229-246, alleviate this concern.</p><p>Oftentimes throughout the manuscript the authors mention trends in the data, but without providing actual numbers. E.g. on line 180: &quot;we noticed many Rad53 peaks […] and many of these localized […]&quot;; providing numbers would be helpful for readers to understand the scale of the observed trends. The authors refer to specific figures, but those figures do not contain any numbers either.</p><p>As another example, at line 198, the authors say &quot;Additional genes show increased Rad53 binding […], but at other promoters Rad53 binding decreases during the same time course […]. However, at most genes Rad53 remains constant.&quot; Numbers would be helpful here. Also, how were the increases and decreases called? What statistical tests and cutoffs were used to make these calls?</p><p>Same questions for page 6, lines 216-217. And also line 221, &quot;numerous gene promoters&quot; – could this be expressed as a fraction of all gene promoters in yeast?</p><p>The authors used &quot;residual analysis in WT&quot; to identify &quot;the top differentially binding (DB) genes&quot; in each set. Why residual analysis and not an established tool for differential binding, such as DEseq? And how were the different experiments in each set combined? For example, the TP set has 3 transcription factor null mutants and one WT condition. Comparing each mutant to the WT will gives three sets of differentially bound gene promoters; how are these combined? Is the direction of the change always the same across the 3 mutants? If not, what is reported in Figure 4b? What exactly is the y-axis in this figure panel?</p><p>The authors continue to say &quot;Many of these genes encode proteins involved in cell cycle progression and cell growth&quot;. How was this determined? Was a statistical analysis (like GSEA) performed?</p><p>The relevance of the comparison between Rad53 ChIP-seq and Swi6 ChIP-seq is not entire clear. Did the authors mean to illustrate that although Rad53 binds to promoters, its pattern of binding is different from that of transcription factors? I.e. Rad53 binds a large set of promoters, but the range of binding signals is generally narrow, while transcription factors tend to bind strongly but to fewer promoters? If this was the intended purpose of the analysis (presented at lines 221-227), why was Swi6 selected? Would other cell-cycle transcription factors also be relevant for this type of analysis?</p><p>The comparisons between Rad53 binding and gene expression (line 248-284) show a clear positive correlation, especially in certain gene subsets/clusters. Further analyses, focused on targets of SBF, MBF, Msn4 and Ste12, confirm these correlations on subsets of genes targeted by these transcription factors. But it is unclear, to this reviewer, whether the authors conclusion that &quot;regulation by SBF appears to be responsible for the correlation between increased Rad53 binding at the promoter and up-regulation of these target genes&quot; is truly supported by the data. The correlations and overlaps are compelling, this is true, but are these significant and do they point to causality?</p><p>In Figure 8b, the authors highlight a few SBF targets that show &quot;significant deviation&quot; from the global trend. (How what the significance assessed?) But these are just the SBF targets in the &quot;Top DB&quot; set, i.e. in differentially bound gene promoters. Since this is how they were selected, shouldn't we expect them to deviate from the global trend? It is not clear how this finding shows that &quot;Rad53 signal changes at these genes depends on SBF&quot;. This section (lines 364-283) continues with some examples of specific genes and their Rad53 promoter binding chances. But it is not clear what the general conclusion is according to these data.</p><p>One aspect that makes the manuscript difficult to read is that there are many observations reported throughout the paper, but it is not always clear how they relate to the main message of the paper. E.g. line 132: &quot;the replication fork collapse was more severe in the absence of Rad53 kinase compared to the absence of checkpoint signaling in the mrcD mutant&quot;. This is an interesting observation, but what is the relevance for the main message of the paper?</p><p>As another example, in the paragraph at line 60 (Introduction), the authors talk about Rfx1 and Ixr1 transcription factors, and the RNR genes. But the relevance of this is unclear at this point.</p><p>As another example, the section at pages 7-8, lines 286-327, discusses Rad53 binding at gene bodies, rather than promoters. This is an interesting finding, but it distracts from the main message of the paper.</p><p>Page 5: The authors separate their ChIP-seq experiments into two groups, or sets: the CP set (WT, Rad53 mutant, and mrc1D) and the TP set (ixr1D, swi4D, swi6D and WT). While the conditions in the CP set are the ones used throughout the paper, the motivation behind the TP set in unclear. How were these particular factors selected? And are the &quot;WT&quot; assays the same in the two groups? For the transcription factors, the authors say they are selected &quot;based on the types of genes that bind Rad53&quot;, but no other details are provided.</p><p>How was differential gene expression performed? (Figure 5)</p><p>Line 343: what does &quot;enrichment score&quot; refer to here? For this analysis, Fisher's exact test seems to be the most appropriate test for assessing enrichment of the Swi4/Swi6 targets among the differentially expressed genes.</p><p>For scatterplot analyses, e.g. Figure 8, there is no statistical analysis of the observed correlations. What are the R2 values and the corresponding p-values for these correlations?</p><p>As mentioned above, the choice of transcription factor null mutants for the Rad53 ChIP-seq experiments is not clearly motivated. SBF (Swi6+Swi4) is definitely a relevant choice, but would this be the top choice in an unbiased analysis of transcription factor proteins? Data on transcription factor gene targets is available for many factors in yeast. An unbiased analysis across all transcription factors could be performed to determine which factor shows the most significant (Fisher's test?) overlap with gene promoters bound by Rad53. In such an analysis, would SBF be the top candidate? If so, this kind of analysis would significantly strengthen the manuscript. Similarly, how was Ixr1 chosen? Was it meant as a control?</p><p><italic>Reviewer #2:</italic></p><p>In the manuscript entitled &quot;Prevalent and Dynamic Binding of the Cell Cycle Checkpoint Kinase Rad53 to Gene Promoters&quot; the authors explore the possibility that occupancy by the replication machinery influences regulation of genes. To do this, the authors measure the occupancy of Rad53, a key signaling kinase for the DNA replication checkpoint (DRC) that binds to replication origins. The authors measure occupancy after putting cells under stress with hydroxyurea in both wild-type cells and in cells in which the DRC is impaired through a mutation in Rad53 and by deletion of Mrc1. With an intact DRC, early origins of replication are activated and are occupied by Rad53. When the DRC is impaired early origins of replication are also activated and are occupied by Rad53, but late origins of replication are activated and occupied as well, indicating a bypass of the DRC. In a key finding, it is also noted that Rad53 occupies regions that are upstream and downstream of a large number of genes, and that the expression of thousands of genes is altered when the DRC is impaired. A difference in Rad53 occupancy near genes often correlates with changes in the expression of these genes. In particular, it appears that an increase in Rad53 binding close to the transcription start site of genes, both upstream and downstream, is correlated with the reduced expression of these genes. A deeper analysis of SBF target genes related to cell cycle and mating-type switching shows a correlation between Rad53 occupancy and gene expression. This appears to show two roles for Rad53 occupancy: inhibition of transcription at some genes when checkpoints are impaired, but also potentially as a transcriptional activator at others. With these roles, the authors assert that Rad53 coordinates both replication and gene expression under replication stress.</p><p>There are two major strengths to this manuscript. The first is that transcription-replication conflicts are increasingly being realized as occurring in eukaryotes, and this manuscript provides an excellent example of when such conflicts might occur. The carefully chosen mutants that bypass DRC even under stress show the aberrant firing of late origins in the proximity of genes whose expression is impaired. This provides a relevant and useful system to study conflicts when replication and transcription are not coordinated. The second major strength of this manuscript is the thorough collection of rich data sets in this system. The correlation of origin activity, Rad53 occupancy, and gene expression in WT and mutant backgrounds before and after administration of HU to induce replication allows probing of correlations between aberrant responses to stress and gene expression. The authors provide useful analyses of these data and demonstrate that bypass-induced binding of Rad53 correlates with reduced gene expression at numerous genes. Thus, their main assertions are supported by the data.</p><p>The main overall weaknesses of the paper are that it is difficult to read with little effort spent to make the work accessible outside the field of replication stress, the findings are not always well connected to provide a convincing argument, the figure resolution often makes them unreadable and impossible to interpret, and some statistical analyses are either missing or inappropriate. The weaknesses are detailed below:</p><p>There is a widespread use of indefinite quantifiers (some, many, several) to make quantitative inferences. Such as:</p><p>Line 200: &quot;most genes&quot; remain constant. How may genes go up, down, and remain constant?</p><p>Line 221: &quot;Visual inspection of the ChIP-seq peaks suggested that Rad53 bound to numerous gene promoters and TSSs throughout the genome.&quot; How many is numerous? What fraction of TSSs?</p><p>Line 305: &quot;Overall, most of the down regulated genes in cluster 1 of this group are situated very close to active origins&quot;. Reporting numbers make this more convincing.</p><p>Line 316: &quot;More down regulated genes are found when the nearby origins are active.&quot; Reporting numbers make this more convincing.</p><p>Virtually all of the SBF target analysis.</p><p>Without quantification and statistics these amount to anecdotal observations. A quantitative inference requires the exact counting of groups followed by a statistical test.</p><p>Comment 1: The introduction is confusing. Line 47: After describing DRC and DDC along with four different kinases, the final sentence states that &quot;the signaling&quot; promotes widespread gene expression changes. All signaling? Rad53 specifically? Line 50 says that Mac1 and Rad53 are essential for cell viability, but Line 52 states that kinase null mutants (presumably either kinase?) are extremely sick. Which is it, sick or dead (essential)? The next sentence states that under bypass conditions (not defined) that sml1- and rad53- cells exhibit a &quot;more severe defect&quot; than mec1- cells, and that implies a role for Rad53 beyond DRC. This is either contradictory to Rad53 being essential, or too much background is left out to understand this pathway under different conditions. In addition, the authors already state that Rad53 has a role in DDC, which is beyond its function in DRC. Later the authors do not do a good job connecting RNR to &quot;upregulating dNTP pools&quot;. This introduction may be clear to those familiar with Rad53 already, but not for others including those interested in transcription regulation or other aspects of signaling.</p><p>As a smaller point, the authors claim in the last paragraph that Rad53 is localized to 20% of promoters suggesting a &quot;global&quot; role in coordinating the response. 20% is not global – it may indicate a multifaceted role in response but global is a very high bar.</p><p>Comment 2: Most of the intro talks about the central role of Mec1 in sensing stress – yet the authors chose to first explore mrc1- cells and their stress response. What's the rationale for choosing that and not mec1-?</p><p>Comment 3, Line 84. The title doesn't help the reader understand the result. Having more heading that emphasized the results might help the reader more.</p><p>Comment 4: Line 101. The accounting for early, late, and inactive origins is confusing in the text but explained better in the methods. In this accounting early is defined as active in WT and late is defined as active in the mutants but not wild type. However, in Figure 2 origins are ranked according to replication timing define elsewhere (Yabuki 2002). Why the difference in the categorization? Do the classifications match perfectly? If so, why not use the Yabuki classification for both and avoid confusion?</p><p>Comment 5, Line 105. The assertion is that rad53_K227A favors late origins over early. Figure 1b shows a scatter plot with signal as the y-axis. It appears that a statistical test has been done to presumably show a significant difference between E (early) and L (late). What test was done (not described in body or figure)? Is the test for the difference in signal? If for signal, it could be that there are strong late ORCs, but more early ORCs – which would be a different test. My reading of &quot;favor&quot; late ORCs would be that there is a greater number of late than early, and that signal is how active the favored ORCs are.</p><p>Comment 6, line 138. The meaning of &quot;the status of replisomes&quot; is not defined and potentially broad. Something more specific would be helpful.</p><p>Comment 7, Line 146. The evidence of &quot;slower progression&quot; of Cdc45 away from the origin in mrc1- mutants is not clear to me. Could the authors describe what they are seeing to help the reader? The heat maps in Figure 2 Supplement 1 are duplicated in Figure 2 b,d, and f. This is not necessary and could be (was) confusing. Further, the Replication TIme scales in Figures 2b,d, and f seem to overlap between early and late – which is odd.</p><p>Comment 8, Line 163 &quot;In contrast, the Mrc1 is not strictly required to induce or maintain -H2A.&quot; is a conclusion that is drawn without describing the result. The result appears to be that gammaH2A deposition is strong in the mutant and persists even at late time points.</p><p>Comment 9: The speculation in paragraph lines 166-169 would fit better in the discussion.</p><p>Comment 10, line 173. &quot;dispersed in late times&quot; – there is only one late time, HU90.</p><p>Comment 11, line 183. The claim that Rad53 signal increases from HU45 to HU90 is not 100% clear from the plots, and requires some type of test. Diffbind is great for this. Also – &quot;A similar pattern occurs at the RNR3 promoter&quot; I don't see this labeled in Figure 3.</p><p>Comment 12, line 190. How is &quot;upstream&quot; of the promoter defined? 1kb? 10kb? I don't see it in the results or methods.</p><p>Comment 13, paragraph 190-200. This is a discussion of Rad53 binding near TSSs. The fractions reported are the fraction of Rad53 peaks near genes. This is interesting, but the abstract reports that Rad53 &quot;coordinates…genome-wide transcription&quot; and binds &quot;20%&quot; of promoters. The number of promoters occupied by Rad53 is not reported here and should be accounted for to make these claims.</p><p>Comment 14: Paragraph lines 202-210. I found this paragraph confusing. First, the description of residual analysis in the methods was confusing. Summing in 25bp windows over 500bp upstream of TSS seems an odd way to calculate enrichment within a region, corrected for counts. R packages such as DiffBind do this quite rigorously, handle replicates well, and report differentially enriched regions with p-values. Also, reporting the difference in enrichment in regions between conditions is confusing – why not just enriched or depleted occupancy? I also could not quite follow what was meant by &quot;435 genes identified in both&quot;. Please clarify, as much of the manuscript relies on this classification.</p><p>Comment 15. Figure 3d is not described in the legend, nor how it was calculated in the methods. This could be a useful plot but needs to be described.</p><p>Comment 16. The clustering conclusions in paragraph lines 250-256 draw distinctions that are not evident. The paragraph states that there is little difference in samples in G1, yet rad53-mutant and mrc1- samples cluster together. The paragraph also states that different from G1, rad53-mutant, and mrc1- samples cluster together in HU45 and HU90. The repeats of each mutant cluster together, but are not even always in the same clade (HU90). This interpretation is a stretch.</p><p>Comment 17. Lines 267-273. I had to read up on co-expression analysis and clustering. It is not clear to me why co-expression analysis is more useful than simple k-means clustering to identify sets of similarly differentially expressed genes. Perhaps a few words on why this method was chosen.</p><p>Comment 18. Line 321: &quot;Furthermore, the bias toward the down regulation is even stronger (&gt;80%) when the nearby origin is in a head-on orientation towards the gene.&quot; What is the percent when co-directional? Is the difference significant? It looks close enough that discerning a difference might require a statistical test (Fisher's Exact).</p><p>Comment 19. I had a hard time following the analysis of SBF and MBF target genes (page 8). First, an &quot;Enrichment Score&quot; is reported for the inclusion of SBF genes in the DEG set. I don't know what an enrichment score is. A more useful score is whether the number of potential SBF target genes is more likely to be differentially regulated than another random transcriptional complex. This can be calculated using Fisher's exact test. Otherwise, reporting that 36 out of 81 is anecdotal (unless the enrichment score is explained better). Second, Figures 8a bottom were impossible to read, and it was not clear what conclusions were to be drawn from them. Lastly, in paragraph lines 367-382, an analysis of the enrichment near genes in SBF mutants was performed. It is asserted that there is a &quot;significant&quot; difference in the enrichment of SBF targets among Top DBs – how was significance calculated? Then, in a series of pictures (Figure 8b insets) that the position of some enrichment is collapsed in mutants. Is this just visual? Calculating the Z-scores for these points and showing that the Z-scores reduce significantly would be a straightforward way to determine that the occupancy collapses toward the average.</p><p>Comment 20, lines 439-440. &quot;Our data is consistent with the possibility that the Rad53 kinase contributes to the transcription regulation as a structural component&quot; I don't know what this means. The manuscript asserts that the activity of Rad53 matters – so what is meant by the assertion that it is a &quot;structural component&quot;?</p><p>Comment 21. For rigor and reproducibility, the processing code should be included, preferably with raw data, in a manner that can be validated by the reviewer with one or few commands.</p><p><italic>Reviewer #3:</italic></p><p>In this study the authors find that unexpectedly RAD53 is bound to promotor regions of 20% of all yeast genes. The authors use genome wide ChIP-seq and correlative analysis to gene expression. Because of its known function during replication stress, experiments were designed with replication stress perturbation. However, the authors found RAD53 is bound to the promotor regions in G1 and without stress, and independent of canonical checkpoint signaling, making an analysis of experiments with replication stress somewhat illogical in the context of the specific discovery.

What follows is the authors’ response to the first round of review.]</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Comments to the Authors:</p><p>We are sorry to say that, after consultation with the reviewers, we have decided that this work will not be considered further for publication by eLife.</p><p>After discussing the manuscript, the reviewers and the reviewing editor concluded that while the paper reports a series of interesting observations related to Rad53 binding to gene promoters independent of checkpoint signaling, the reviewers found the main message of the paper to be unclear. The paper starts with an attempt to look at RAD53 binding to replicons, but finds binding of RAD53 to promoter sites in G1 and in the absence of replication stress. Despite this intriguing observation, the results are analyzed with respect to stressed replication. As a result, the paper does not address reasons or consequences of the observed phenotype other than transcription/replication collisions.</p><p>From a technical point of view, all reviewers were concerned with the lack of statistics to draw inferences regarding the central question: Does Rad53 coordinate both replication and transcription in response to stress, and do the mutants disrupt this coordination. While it is often useful, to note a trend that is worth exploring, where numbers are available the validity of these inferences must be drawn to strengthen the conclusions.</p></disp-quote><p>Despite criticisms on the previous version of manuscript (previous manuscript) about the clarity of background information and about lacking quantitative inferences and statistics (all have now been addressed in the revised manuscript), it is apparent that reviewers found many aspects of this study valuable with interesting observations and rich datasets. Furthermore, reviewer 2 pointed out that we “provide useful analyses of these data and demonstrate that bypass-induced binding of Rad53 correlates with reduced gene expression at numerous genes. Thus, their main assertions are supported by the data..” And reviewer 1 pointed out that our analysis alleviate the concern [related to the &quot;expression bias&quot; previously reported in ChIP-seq datasets, where false peaks were observed at some highly-expressed genes…]</p><p>We have made several changes in the revised manuscript (revised manuscript) and believe that this work merits consideration for publication by <italic>eLife</italic>.</p><p>Changes we have made to the manuscript and responses to general points</p><p>1) The previous manuscript included ample amount of data and analysis around the replication aspect of the Rad53 functions as these results constituted as logical connection to the prior knowledge of this kinase. Nevertheless, upon further consideration, we realized this part of work, while interesting, has become somewhat a distraction from the unexpected new finding that Rad53 is also functioning at gene promoters. Thus, after careful consideration, we decided to reorganize the presentation and removed panels related to DNA replicaiton from the main figures, mainly Figures 1 and 2 in the previous manuscript. The revised manuscript started directly from the finding of Rad53 localizing to gene promoters in asynchronous cell populations. We believe such presentation would direct the focus more appropriately and make the main message clear. Importantly, the revised manuscript also made quantitative inferences and relevant statistics more explicitly, as recommended by reviewers, to strengthen the conclusions.</p><p>2) The reviewers found the previous manuscript hard to read, particularly for readers without specific background knowledge. We acknowledged, indeed, that many criticisms of the previous manuscript arose because of misunderstanding of our presentation. The revised manuscript explained the background more carefully and thus improved the readability for more general audience.</p><p>3) Reviewers raised questions about some of less-conventional analysis choices we used in this study. In particular, the use of residual analysis instead of a common tool DiffBind for identification of to identify differential binding of Rad53 to gene promoters. Below, we provide further explanation and evidence that our methods are consistent with, and more appropriate than the conventional one for analysis of our datasets.</p><p>Briefly, residual analysis extracted the top 1000 deviated genes as top differential binding (DB) genes from aggregated read coverage while DiffBind computed significant q-values from duplicated signal comparison. We compared the DB genes identified from the two methods using G1 and HU45 datasets in experiment CP and found that the DB genes showed reasonable correlation (Spearman r = 0.7278) and p-value &lt; 2.2e-16 for overlap (both 608, DiffBind only 2254, residual only 392, others 3873). We considered reporting the analysis using DiffBind as suggested by the reviewers, but there are several issues with applying DiffBind for these data sets.</p><p>i) Residual analysis controls for input whereas DiffBind does not.</p><p>ii) More than 40 % of all genes ended up as DB genes from WT G1 to HU45 in the CP experiment in DiffBind. This likely reflected the increased Rad53 protein level in HU45 thus this method is not ideal to determine which gene promoters are preferentially regulated.</p><p>iii) We further checked the reproducibility of DB genes by applying DiffBind to datasets from two independent experiments CP and TF. There were only 81 reproducible DB genes. In contrast, there were 435 reproducible DB genes when the residual analyses were applied to the same datasets.</p><p>Thus, we decided to use residual analysis to identify DB genes for further analysis.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Reviewer #1:</p><p>Strength: Upon first reading of the abstract, there was some concern that the observed Rad53 ChIP-seq at promoters could be related to the &quot;expression bias&quot; previously reported in ChIP-seq data sets, where false peaks were observed at some highly-expressed genes, even for exogeneous non-DNA binding proteins. The authors' analyses, especially lines 229-246, alleviate this concern.</p></disp-quote><p>We maintained these analyses that the reviewer deemed a strength in the revised manuscript.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Oftentimes throughout the manuscript the authors mention trends in the data, but without providing actual numbers. E.g. on line 180: &quot;we noticed many Rad53 peaks […] and many of these localized […]&quot;; providing numbers would be helpful for readers to understand the scale of the observed trends. The authors refer to specific figures, but those figures do not contain any numbers either.</p><p>As another example, at line 198, the authors say &quot;Additional genes show increased Rad53 binding […], but at other promoters Rad53 binding decreases during the same time course […]. However, at most genes Rad53 remains constant.&quot; Numbers would be helpful here. Also, how were the increases and decreases called? What statistical tests and cutoffs were used to make these calls?</p><p>Same questions for page 6, lines 216-217. And also line 221, &quot;numerous gene promoters&quot; – could this be expressed as a fraction of all gene promoters in yeast?</p></disp-quote><p>All issues raised in this paragraph are addressed in the context of revised manuscript. Specific points from this paragraph are addressed as two separate points.</p><p>1)Concerning points raised for line 180 and line 221 in the previous manuscript: Quantitative inferences for the Rad53 binding to gene promoters are presented in the first section “Rad53 is recruited to genomic loci other than replication origins in proliferating yeast cells”.</p><p>There we described analysis that established the claim that Rad53 binds to more than 20 % of all gene promoters in proliferating cells (new manuscript lines 89-112). Furthermore, analysis of ChIP-seq peaks from a synchronized population showed that ~90% of the Rad53 ChIP-seq peaks were found at gene promoters at all stages investigated (Figure 2b).</p><p>2) Concerning points raised in line 198 and 216-217 of the previous manuscript:</p><p>These are addressed in the Results section “Identification of genes with differential binding (DB genes) of Rad53 at promoters”. There we used residual analysis to identify genes with differential binding of Rad53 at their promoters. (see “Changes we have made to the manuscript and responses to general points” section above for rationale to use residual analysis). Text in 216-217 of the previous manuscript is related to previous figure 3a. The exact figure has been removed as our main focus is on how specific transcription factors, Swi4 and Swi6, impact recruitment of Rad53 to promoters. Nevertheless, the normalized coverage tracks for WT samples in different stages are presented in the revised Figure 2c and the related text in Results section “Binding of Rad53 to upstream TSS changes with the cell cycle stages”. The presentation in revised Figure 2c merely pointed out that, even by visual inspection, signals at promoters of genes such as <italic>RNR1</italic>, <italic>PCL1</italic> and <italic>TOS6</italic> appeared varied depending on the cell cycle stage (G1, HU45 and HU90). This observation was further confirmed by the result of residual analysis described in the later subsection “Identification of genes with differential binding (DB genes) of Rad53 at promoters”. That is, these three genes were among the top ranking deviations in the residual analysis of WT samples in both of the two independent datasets.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>The authors used &quot;residual analysis in WT&quot; to identify &quot;the top differentially binding (DB) genes&quot; in each set. Why residual analysis and not an established tool for differential binding, such as DEseq? And how were the different experiments in each set combined? For example, the TP set has 3 transcription factor null mutants and one WT condition. Comparing each mutant to the WT will gives three sets of differentially bound gene promoters; how are these combined? Is the direction of the change always the same across the 3 mutants? If not, what is reported in Figure 4b? What exactly is the y-axis in this figure panel?</p><p>The authors continue to say &quot;Many of these genes encode proteins involved in cell cycle progression and cell growth&quot;. How was this determined? Was a statistical analysis (like GSEA) performed?</p></disp-quote><p>Issues raised in this paragraph will be address in three parts.</p><p>1) Regarding the reviewer's question “Why residual analysis and not an established tool for differential binding, such as DEseq?”, we believe the reviewer means DiffBind tool instead of DEseq, which is designed to apply a DE-seq2 strategy for ChIP-seq data. To validate the applicability of DiffBind for the samples with varied DNA input, we detected the DB genes in WT from two independent experiments CP and TF using DiffBind. As discussed above, a problem of reproducibility was found for DiffBind results presumably because DiffBind does not control for the input and did not take into account the general trends. See above “Changes we have made to the manuscript and responses to general points” section above for rationale to use residual analysis.</p><p>2) We regret the insufficient explanation that led to the questioning by the reviewer “how were the different experiments in each set combined?”. We have modified the description in the revised manuscript and indicated more clearly the datasets used in the analysis in the Results section “Identification of genes with differential binding (DB genes) of Rad53 at promoters”. In the case of our residual analysis for identifying genes with differential binding of Rad53 at promoters, only datasets of WT samples were used. We did not combine different experiments. Rather, each experiment has its own replicates and was analyzed separately and only data of stage G1 and HU45 from the same experiments were used for comparison with each other. The result is shown in Figure 3 of the revised manuscript. The previous 4b (now revised Figure 3b) presented the 435 genes that were within the top 1000 ranking in both of the two independent analyses for datasets in experiment TF and datasets in experiment named CP. In response to reviewer’s specific point, the y-axis numbers in the corresponding figure panel are residuals from analysis of experiment TF and this is now stated in the figure legend in revised manuscript.</p><p>3)Among the 435 genes identified, there are genes that have well-documented functions in cell cycle, cell growth, etc. Thus, we merely point this out in the text. The statement is based on prior knowledge rather than the implicating bioinformatical analysis. We believe, in addition to hints from bioinformatics, it is equally justified to use the knowledge from the literatures for direction. After all, these are very well characterized genes.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>The relevance of the comparison between Rad53 ChIP-seq and Swi6 ChIP-seq is not entire clear. Did the authors mean to illustrate that although Rad53 binds to promoters, its pattern of binding is different from that of transcription factors? I.e. Rad53 binds a large set of promoters, but the range of binding signals is generally narrow, while transcription factors tend to bind strongly but to fewer promoters? If this was the intended purpose of the analysis (presented at lines 221-227), why was Swi6 selected? Would other cell-cycle transcription factors also be relevant for this type of analysis?</p></disp-quote><p>The related data (in revised manuscript Figure 2d) is to show the low specificity of Rad53 binding sites compared with binding sites of Swi6. In other words, Rad53 has a higher coverage for many promoters while Swi6 shows substantially high coverage only for a limited number of promoters, as the reviewer pointed out. Thus, it is likely Rad53 would effect a wider range of genes than the Swi6 regulatory network. Swi6 was chosen for this analysis because in the work presented later in the manuscript, where we found that deletion of Swi6 affected Rad53 recruitment to promoters in a small subset of genes. Furthermore, Swi6 would affect two major cell-cycle transcription factors SBF and MBF. The comparison between Rad53 and Swi6 biding to gene promoters emphasizes the observation that Rad53 binds to many more genes than conventional transcription factors.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>The comparisons between Rad53 binding and gene expression (line 248-284) show a clear positive correlation, especially in certain gene subsets/clusters. Further analyses, focused on targets of SBF, MBF, Msn4 and Ste12, confirm these correlations on subsets of genes targeted by these transcription factors. But it is unclear, to this reviewer, whether the authors conclusion that &quot;regulation by SBF appears to be responsible for the correlation between increased Rad53 binding at the promoter and up-regulation of these target genes&quot; is truly supported by the data. The correlations and overlaps are compelling, this is true, but are these significant and do they point to causality?</p></disp-quote><p>The issue raised here might be semantic. We agree with the reviewer that the correlation and overlaps do not demonstrate causality and we did not intend to claim such. We have now modified the statement to &quot;regulation by SBF may be responsible for the correlation between increased Rad53 binding at the promoter and up-regulation of these target genes&quot; to simply point out the SBF might have a role in increased Rad53 binding, in addition to its role in up-regulation of SBF targets. And this led us to the next investigation presented in Result section “SBF is a key factor for recruitment of Rad53 to the promoters of its target genes under replication stress condition”. There we presented the experiments to determine the contribution of various transcription regulators in recruitment of Rad53. And, indeed, mutation in SBF did affect Rad53 binding to the gene promoters of SBF targets (revised Figure 8).</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>In Figure 8b, the authors highlight a few SBF targets that show &quot;significant deviation&quot; from the global trend. (How what the significance assessed?) But these are just the SBF targets in the &quot;Top DB&quot; set, i.e. in differentially bound gene promoters. Since this is how they were selected, shouldn't we expect them to deviate from the global trend? It is not clear how this finding shows that &quot;Rad53 signal changes at these genes depends on SBF&quot;. This section (lines 364-283) continues with some examples of specific genes and their Rad53 promoter binding chances. But it is not clear what the general conclusion is according to these data.</p></disp-quote><p>We modify the phrase &quot;significant deviation&quot; to “clear deviation” as it merely means that these SBF targets are in the 435 TopDB identified in residual analysis. And, as the reviewer pointed out, “since this is how they were selected”, we indeed expected “them to deviate from the global trend“ in the context of the <italic>WT</italic> datasets. Most importantly, however, is the fact that such deviation is no longer evident for these SBF targets when plotted using the signal data obtained from SBF mutants. This finding demonstrated that Rad53 signal changes at these gene promoters depends on SBF. This is the conclusion according to these data.</p><p>Furthermore, we added a new panel (suggested by reviewer #2), showing the Z-score distribution of Rad53 DB residual (G1→HU45) and found substantial deviation of SBF target genes from the rest of the genes in <italic>WT</italic> (revised Figure 8b), while in the <italic>swi4Δ</italic> and <italic>swi6Δ</italic> mutants, the deviation of the SBF targets was closer to other genes.</p><p>Note: in the revised manuscript, we use the term “general trend” instead of “global trend” to describe the overall increase of Rad53 ChIP signal in HU samples, likely due to increased Rad53 protein level in cells treated with HU (Figure 2 —figure supplement 1).</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>One aspect that makes the manuscript difficult to read is that there are many observations reported throughout the paper, but it is not always clear how they relate to the main message of the paper. E.g. line 132: &quot;the replication fork collapse was more severe in the absence of Rad53 kinase compared to the absence of checkpoint signaling in the mrcD mutant&quot;. This is an interesting observation, but what is the relevance for the main message of the paper?</p><p>As another example, in the paragraph at line 60 (Introduction), the authors talk about Rfx1 and Ixr1 transcription factors, and the RNR genes. But the relevance of this is unclear at this point.</p><p>As another example, the section at pages 7-8, lines 286-327, discusses Rad53 binding at gene bodies, rather than promoters. This is an interesting finding, but it distracts from the main message of the paper.</p></disp-quote><p>The issues raised here about relevance of results and text at previous line 132… is addressed in the revised manuscript as we removed some of the data related to the replication function of Rad53.

While the conditions in the CP set are the ones used throughout the paper, the motivation behind the TP set in unclear. How were these particular factors selected? And are the &quot;WT&quot; assays the same in the two groups? For the transcription factors, the authors say they are selected &quot;based on the types of genes that bind Rad53&quot;, but no other details are provided.</p></disp-quote><p>We regretted that the description and terms for CP and TP sets we used in the previous manuscript caused confusion. All the ChIP-seq experiments using synchronized cultures were done under the same conditions in this study. CP and TF simply referred to two independent experiments. In each independent experiment, WT samples from G1, HU45 and HU90 were included in parallel to samples from mutants at the same stages. The analysis related to what the reviewer was referring to in Page 5 (of previous manuscript) is the datasets used in residual analysis, in which only the datasets from <italic>WT</italic> samples were used (revised Figure 3). Detail of residual analysis done in this study is provided in the result section “Identification of genes with differential binding (DB genes) of Rad53 at promoters” and further detail in the Materials and methods section “ChIP-seq residual analysis”. Mutant datasets were not used in the analysis presented in this part of the study.</p><p>About the choice of transcription mutants in ChIP-seq experiment used for further analyses, we selected <italic>swi4Δ</italic> and <italic>swi6Δ</italic> mutants because we noticed SBF targets in both DEGs and Rad53 DB genes in the conditions analyzed (i.e., G1 vs HU45). See more detail in “Rad53 binding changes coincide with the changes in gene expression for targets of cell cycle regulators SBF and MBF” of the Result section. The <italic>ixr1Δ</italic> mutant was also examined because a previous investigation found that Ixr1 binds to the <italic>RNR1</italic> promoter upon genotoxic stress and mediates Dun1- independent <italic>RNR1</italic> gene regulation that requires Rad53, which exhibited dynamic binding at the <italic>RNR1</italic> gene promoter in this study.

SBF (Swi6+Swi4) is definitely a relevant choice, but would this be the top choice in an unbiased analysis of transcription factor proteins? Data on transcription factor gene targets is available for many factors in yeast. An unbiased analysis across all transcription factors could be performed to determine which factor shows the most significant (Fisher's test?) overlap with gene promoters bound by Rad53. In such an analysis, would SBF be the top candidate? If so, this kind of analysis would significantly strengthen the manuscript. Similarly, how was Ixr1 chosen? Was it meant as a control?</p></disp-quote><p>The choice of the transcription factor null mutants for the Rad53 ChIP-seq experiments has been addressed in response to an earlier point by the same reviewer.

In paragraph starting “About the choice of transcription mutants in ChIP-seq experiment….”</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Reviewer #2:</p><p>In the manuscript entitled &quot;Prevalent and Dynamic Binding of the Cell Cycle Checkpoint Kinase Rad53 to Gene Promoters&quot; the authors explore the possibility that occupancy by the replication machinery influences regulation of genes. To do this, the authors measure the occupancy of Rad53, a key signaling kinase for the DNA replication checkpoint (DRC) that binds to replication origins. The authors measure occupancy after putting cells under stress with hydroxyurea in both wild-type cells and in cells in which the DRC is impaired through a mutation in Rad53 and by deletion of Mrc1. With an intact DRC, early origins of replication are activated and are occupied by Rad53. When the DRC is impaired early origins of replication are also activated and are occupied by Rad53, but late origins of replication are activated and occupied as well, indicating a bypass of the DRC. In a key finding, it is also noted that Rad53 occupies regions that are upstream and downstream of a large number of genes, and that the expression of thousands of genes is altered when the DRC is impaired. A difference in Rad53 occupancy near genes often correlates with changes in the expression of these genes. In particular, it appears that an increase in Rad53 binding close to the transcription start site of genes, both upstream and downstream, is correlated with the reduced expression of these genes. A deeper analysis of SBF target genes related to cell cycle and mating-type switching shows a correlation between Rad53 occupancy and gene expression. This appears to show two roles for Rad53 occupancy: inhibition of transcription at some genes when checkpoints are impaired, but also potentially as a transcriptional activator at others. With these roles, the authors assert that Rad53 coordinates both replication and gene expression under replication stress.</p><p>There are two major strengths to this manuscript. The first is that transcription-replication conflicts are increasingly being realized as occurring in eukaryotes, and this manuscript provides an excellent example of when such conflicts might occur. The carefully chosen mutants that bypass DRC even under stress show the aberrant firing of late origins in the proximity of genes whose expression is impaired. This provides a relevant and useful system to study conflicts when replication and transcription are not coordinated. The second major strength of this manuscript is the thorough collection of rich data sets in this system. The correlation of origin activity, Rad53 occupancy, and gene expression in WT and mutant backgrounds before and after administration of HU to induce replication allows probing of correlations between aberrant responses to stress and gene expression. The authors provide useful analyses of these data and demonstrate that bypass-induced binding of Rad53 correlates with reduced gene expression at numerous genes. Thus, their main assertions are supported by the data.</p><p>The main overall weaknesses of the paper are that it is difficult to read with little effort spent to make the work accessible outside the field of replication stress, the findings are not always well connected to provide a convincing argument, the figure resolution often makes them unreadable and impossible to interpret, and some statistical analyses are either missing or inappropriate. The weaknesses are detailed below:</p><p>There is a widespread use of indefinite quantifiers (some, many, several) to make quantitative inferences. Such as:</p><p>Line 200: &quot;most genes&quot; remain constant. How may genes go up, down, and remain constant?</p><p>Line 221: &quot;Visual inspection of the ChIP-seq peaks suggested that Rad53 bound to numerous gene promoters and TSSs throughout the genome.&quot; How many is numerous? What fraction of TSSs?</p><p>Line 305: &quot;Overall, most of the down regulated genes in cluster 1 of this group are situated very close to active origins&quot;. Reporting numbers make this more convincing.</p><p>Line 316: &quot;More down regulated genes are found when the nearby origins are active.&quot; Reporting numbers make this more convincing.</p><p>Virtually all of the SBF target analysis.</p><p>Without quantification and statistics these amount to anecdotal observations. A quantitative inference requires the exact counting of groups followed by a statistical test.</p></disp-quote><p>We have addressed the overall weaknesses in the revised manuscript. The revised manuscript explains the background more carefully and thus improves the readability for a more general audience. In addition, we have presented relevant statistics more explicitly in the text and figures. Many thanks to the suggestion of the reviewer. See also above “Changes we have made to the manuscript and responses to general points”.</p><p>The numbers that the reviewer deem necessary in these series of examples, when possible, were indeed presented in the text or charts in the figures of the previous manuscript despite the use of the indefinite quantifiers (some, many, several) as the reviewer pointed out and we appreciated this. For example, as cited by the reviewer in the next comment, “…Rad53 is localized to 20% of promoters…” In the revised manuscript, we have made further improvement, in particular the presentation of statistical tests and we have also refrained from using the indefinite quantifiers.</p><p>More detailed response to comments of reviewer #2 below.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Comment 1: The introduction is confusing. Line 47: After describing DRC and DDC along with four different kinases, the final sentence states that &quot;the signaling&quot; promotes widespread gene expression changes. All signaling? Rad53 specifically? Line 50 says that Mac1 and Rad53 are essential for cell viability, but Line 52 states that kinase null mutants (presumably either kinase?) are extremely sick. Which is it, sick or dead (essential)? The next sentence states that under bypass conditions (not defined) that sml1- and rad53- cells exhibit a &quot;more severe defect&quot; than mec1- cells, and that implies a role for Rad53 beyond DRC. This is either contradictory to Rad53 being essential, or too much background is left out to understand this pathway under different conditions. In addition, the authors already state that Rad53 has a role in DDC, which is beyond its function in DRC. Later the authors do not do a good job connecting RNR to &quot;upregulating dNTP pools&quot;. This introduction may be clear to those familiar with Rad53 already, but not for others including those interested in transcription regulation or other aspects of signaling.</p><p>As a smaller point, the authors claim in the last paragraph that Rad53 is localized to 20% of promoters suggesting a &quot;global&quot; role in coordinating the response. 20% is not global – it may indicate a multifaceted role in response but global is a very high bar.</p></disp-quote><p>We thank the reviewer for pointing out specifically the parts in the Introduction that were confusing for more general audience. In response, we have carefully rewrote the background section and made better explanation on connecting the functional relationship among <italic>RAD53</italic>, <italic>RNR1</italic> and <italic>SML1</italic> genes and their roles in regulating cellular dNTP level.</p><p>For the next smaller point, in the revised manuscript, instead of “global”, we used “multifaceted”, which indeed depicts more appropriately how we envision Rad53 would function. Great suggestion from the reviewer.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Comment 2: Most of the intro talks about the central role of Mec1 in sensing stress – yet the authors chose to first explore mrc1- cells and their stress response. What's the rationale for choosing that and not mec1-?</p></disp-quote><p>The focus of the study is Rad53. In the Introduction, Mec1 was mentioned as the upstream kinase of Rad53 and not really emphasized beyond this point. In the revised manuscript, we indeed started with a result showing that Mec1 is not required for the promoter binding of Rad53 (Figure 1b). We studied Mrc1 because of its specific function in the DRC branch that mediated the signal in response to HU stress. In the context of the revised manuscript, <italic>mrc1Δ</italic> mutant is a great tool for providing a window through which we could examine the effect of untimely activation of late origins on transcription of nearby genes.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Comment 3, Line 84.

The accounting for early, late, and inactive origins is confusing in the text but explained better in the methods. In this accounting early is defined as active in WT and late is defined as active in the mutants but not wild type. However, in Figure 2 origins are ranked according to replication timing define elsewhere (Yabuki 2002). Why the difference in the categorization? Do the classifications match perfectly? If so, why not use the Yabuki classification for both and avoid confusion?</p></disp-quote><p>We define early, late, and inactive origins according to the activity of replication origins from our data on de novo DNA synthesis from origins. But this classification does not give us information of time order in continuum. Yabuki’s study, on the other hand, measured time order of chromosome replication rather than the activation time of each origin, though the replication time and origin activation time would largely correlate with each other. Furthermore, their data were measured under different growth conditions. We used their result as a guide to order the origins on the heatmaps for presentation purpose but did not use their data in specific analyses. Overall, the two classification agree with each other.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Comment 5, Line 105. The assertion is that rad53_K227A favors late origins over early. Figure 1b shows a scatter plot with signal as the y-axis. It appears that a statistical test has been done to presumably show a significant difference between E (early) and L (late). What test was done (not described in body or figure)? Is the test for the difference in signal? If for signal, it could be that there are strong late ORCs, but more early ORCs – which would be a different test. My reading of &quot;favor&quot; late ORCs would be that there is a greater number of late than early, and that signal is how active the favored ORCs are.</p></disp-quote><p>Mann-Whitney test has been done to show a significant difference in EdU signal (i.e. nucleotide incorporation) between E (early) and L (late) origins. The interpretation is there is more DNA synthesis from late origins observed than from early origins in this particular mutant up to the time when samples were collected. ORC is the Origin Recognition Complex that binds replication origins in a sequence-specific manner as the first step in DNA replication. But perhaps the reviewer meant origin here. We thank the reviewer for the question and will be more careful with the description when presenting this result in the future as this specific result related to DNA replication is no longer presented in the revised manuscript.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Comment 6, line 138.

The evidence of &quot;slower progression&quot; of Cdc45 away from the origin in mrc1- mutants is not clear to me. Could the authors describe what they are seeing to help the reader? The heat maps in Figure 2 Supplement 1 are duplicated in Figure 2 b,d, and f. This is not necessary and could be (was) confusing. Further, the Replication TIme scales in Figures 2b,d, and f seem to overlap between early and late – which is odd.</p><p>Comment 8, Line 163 &quot;In contrast, the Mrc1 is not strictly required to induce or maintain -H2A.&quot; is a conclusion that is drawn without describing the result.

But we appreciate the reviewer’s careful reading and helpful suggestion and will use them as guidance for presentation of this result in the future. Furthermore, we would like to clarify the issue the reviewer raised about the presentation of heatmaps around origins. In the previous manuscript, the heatmaps in Figure 2 Supplement 1 and in Figure 2 b, d and f were not duplicated but different presentations of the same dataset. In the previous Figure 2 Supplement 1, the origins were ordered according to the replication timing determine in Yabuki’s study. (This presentation is now in Figure 2 Supplement 3 of the revised manuscript). In the previous Figure 2, we separated origins into two categories, i.e. early and late origins, according to our EdU incorporation data, and then ordered origins in each group according to Yabuki’s timing. As explained in the response to comment 4 (see above), the two classification agree with each other. However, disagreement can be anticipated in situations where passive replication from and adjacent early origins renders chromosomal DNA containing late origins becoming early-replicating regions.</p><p>Thus, it is expected to have some overlap in the time scales for early and late origins using Yabuki’s timing order.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Comment 11, line 183.

I found this paragraph confusing. First, the description of residual analysis in the methods was confusing. Summing in 25bp windows over 500bp upstream of TSS seems an odd way to calculate enrichment within a region, corrected for counts. R packages such as DiffBind do this quite rigorously, handle replicates well, and report differentially enriched regions with p-values. Also, reporting the difference in enrichment in regions between conditions is confusing – why not just enriched or depleted occupancy? I also could not quite follow what was meant by &quot;435 genes identified in both&quot;. Please clarify, as much of the manuscript relies on this classification.</p></disp-quote><p>We appreciate the reviewer’s comment about our presentation of analysis to identify genes with differential binding of Rad53 at their promoter. In the revised manuscript, the process of this analysis is presented in the Results section “Identification of genes with differential binding (DB genes) of Rad53 at promoters” and explained in more clarity. To detect differentially binding at gene promoters, we computed the read coverage for each 25 bp window due to the limitation of computational resource and time for deepTools. Note that this window size is a half of their default size 50 bp. We focused on the 500 bp window upstream from each TSS where gene promoters are expected to reside in <italic>S. cerevisiae</italic> and applied residual analysis to compare G1 and HU45 signals using datasets from two independent experiments in order to improve the reproducibility of our DB detection.

I had a hard time following the analysis of SBF and MBF target genes (page 8). First, an &quot;Enrichment Score&quot; is reported for the inclusion of SBF genes in the DEG set. I don't know what an enrichment score is. A more useful score is whether the number of potential SBF target genes is more likely to be differentially regulated than another random transcriptional complex. This can be calculated using Fisher's exact test. Otherwise, reporting that 36 out of 81 is anecdotal (unless the enrichment score is explained better). Second, Figures 8a bottom were impossible to read, and it was not clear what conclusions were to be drawn from them. Lastly, in paragraph lines 367-382, an analysis of the enrichment near genes in SBF mutants was performed. It is asserted that there is a &quot;significant&quot; difference in the enrichment of SBF targets among Top DBs – how was significance calculated? Then, in a series of pictures (Figure 8b insets) that the position of some enrichment is collapsed in mutants. Is this just visual?

(Perhaps the reviewer is referring to the same section addressed above in points (1) and (2) of this comment?) Instead, we pointed out there that SBF targets in TOP DB showed “significant” deviation from the general trend in the WT data. The ChIP-seq signal for SBF targets were shown in colors different from the rest of genes in the scatter plots include ChIP-seq signal for all genes. The presentation is also visual and the lack of deviation is evident in the SBF mutants (<italic>swi6Δ</italic> and <italic>swi4Δ</italic>).

The authors use genome wide ChIP-seq and correlative analysis to gene expression. Because of its known function during replication stress, experiments were designed with replication stress perturbation. However, the authors found RAD53 is bound to the promotor regions in G1 and without stress, and independent of canonical checkpoint signaling, making an analysis of experiments with replication stress somewhat illogical in the context of the specific discovery. Moreover, it introduces multiple additional variables directly affecting gene expression. This challenges the strength of interpretations of the correlations made.</p></disp-quote><p>We respectively disagree with the reviewers comments that the discovery is illogical. Science is advanced by experimenters making observations that are unexpected. We described the study in which we analyzed the localization of Rad53 in the genome using ChIP-seq in the original context of entry into S phase with a HU-induced DNA damage response. We did not expect that Rad53 bound to so many gene promoters in the DNA damage response and certainly did not expect that Rad53 would be bound to TSSs in G1 phase, but this is how discoveries are made. We did place emphasis in the revised paper on Rad53 binding to genes and particularly to TSS regions of genes rather than the origin binding observations to focus the paper more on Rad53 binding to promoters. We showed that in a number of cases, Rad53 binding is influenced by sequence specific transcription factors. This is not, in our view, illogical. Rather it is a novel discovery.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Generally the correlations between RAD53 promotor biding and gene expression (some genes are some not) appear to be low. It is also unclear from the manuscript what matrix the authors use to claim significance of a given correlation.</p></disp-quote><p>The reviewer pointed out that “the correlations between RAD53 promotor biding and gene expression (some genes are some not) appear to be low….”. However, the correlations, while not extremely high, are significant for specific subset of genes, catogorized by either co- expression clusters (Figure 5c) or target of specific transcription factors (Figure 7a). Results of statistical tests are included more clearly in the revised manuscript. Furthermore, we find it even more interesting that other co-expression clusters did not show clear correlations, suggesting the possibility these other subsets might be responding to different signals. In the follow up study we plan to investigate the effect of other type of stresses on Rad53 recruitment, dynamic binding and gene expression.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Moreover, alternative interpretations are not considered. The authors solely investigate RAD53 promotor binding for its correlative effects on gene expression. While the finding that RAD53 is bound to promotor sites in the absence of stress is very interesting and promises for a potential greater implication of repair proteins in the conservation of transcription, promotor site binding of repair proteins have been previously reported Specifically, NEIL1 is preloaded at promotor sites of evolutionary critical genes and shown to promote rapid and efficient repair of promotor sites for conversation of critical genes. Such alternatives interpretation are not considered.</p><p>The authors may want to consider discussing (Nucleic Acids Research, Volume 49, Issue 1, 11 January 2021, Pages 221-243,) in the context of their discovery.</p><p>The authors use a kinase dead RAD53 mutant and a checkpoint dead mutant strain to suggest that RAD53 promotor binding is independent of a stress response.

Thus, we have added discussion on the idea of preemptive recruitment of repair factors to potentially vulnerable chromatin regions and also included the recommended reference in the Discussion section. The reviewer also recommended studying alternative rad53 mutant strains, which we have indeed begun to incorporate in our follow up studies. We hope to report these new studies in a new manuscript.</p><p>For clarification, we suggested that recruitment of Rad53 to gene promoter does not require the kinase activity <italic>in cis</italic> and nor checkpoint signaling. However, in no way did we try to rule out the contribution of checkpoint signaling or Rad53 kinase activity on a subset of genes. Rather, we suggested that binding can be modulated by multitude of responses eliciated by the experimental condition, not solely the well-defined DRC checkpoint signaling pathway. And the best example is the <italic>RNR1</italic> gene promoter, to which the Rad53 binding is affected by checkpoint response as well as cell cycle regulation (high-lighted in Figure 8a).</p></body></sub-article></article>
