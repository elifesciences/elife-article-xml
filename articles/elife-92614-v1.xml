and eosin (H&amp;E) stained slide-based pathology by providing cellular information in high throughput manner. However, conventional techniques provided superficial information only due to shallow imaging depths. Herein, we developed open-top two-photon light sheet microscopy (OT-TP-LSM) for intraoperative 3D pathology. An extended depth of field two-photon excitation light sheet was generated by scanning a nondiffractive Bessel beam, and selective planar imaging was conducted with cameras at 400 frames/s max during the lateral translation of tissue specimens. Intrinsic second harmonic generation was collected for additional extracellular matrix (ECM) visualization. OT-TP-LSM was tested in various human cancer specimens including skin, pancreas, and prostate. High imaging depths were achieved owing to long excitation wavelengths and long wavelength fluorophores. 3D visualization of both cells and ECM enhanced the ability of cancer detection. Furthermore, an unsupervised deep learning network was employed for the style transfer of OT-TP-LSM images to virtual H&amp;E images. The virtual H&amp;E images exhibited comparable histological characteristics to real ones. OT-TP-LSM may have the potential for histopathological examination in surgical and biopsy applications by rapidly providing 3D information.</p></abstract><kwd-group kwd-group-type="author-keywords"><kwd>nondestructive pathology</kwd><kwd>3D pathology</kwd><kwd>two-photon light sheet microscopy</kwd><kwd>bessel beam illumination</kwd><kwd>3D imaging</kwd><kwd>unsupervised deep learning</kwd></kwd-group><kwd-group kwd-group-type="research-organism"><title>Research organism</title><kwd>Human</kwd><kwd>Other</kwd></kwd-group><funding-group><award-group id="fund1"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100003725</institution-id><institution>National Research Foundation of Korea</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>NRF-2020R1A2C3009309</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Kim</surname><given-names>Ki Hean</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund2"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100019266</institution-id><institution>Korea Medical Device Development Fund</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>9991006749</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Kim</surname><given-names>Ki Hean</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund3"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100019266</institution-id><institution>Korea Medical Device Development Fund</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>KMDF_PR_20200901_0076</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Kim</surname><given-names>Ki Hean</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><funding-statement>The funders had no role in study design, data collection and interpretation, or the decision to submit the work for publication.</funding-statement></funding-group><custom-meta-group><custom-meta specific-use="meta-only"><meta-name>Author impact statement</meta-name><meta-value>Open-top Bessel beam two-photon light sheet microscopy have the potential for rapid and accurate nondestructive pathology by visualizing 3D histological information.</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta specific-use="meta-only"><meta-name>publishing-route</meta-name><meta-value>prc</meta-value></custom-meta></custom-meta-group></article-meta></front><body><sec id="s1" sec-type="intro"><title>Introduction</title><p>Precise intraoperative cancer diagnosis is crucial for achieving optimal patient outcomes by enabling complete tumor removal. The standard method is the microscopic cellular examination of surgically excised specimens following various processing steps, including thin sectioning and hematoxylin and eosin (H&amp;E) cell staining. However, this examination method is laborious and time-consuming. Furthermore, it has inherent artifacts that disturb accurate diagnosis, including tissue loss, limited two-dimensional (2D) information, and sampling error (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Liu et al., 2021</xref>). High-speed three-dimensional (3D) optical microscopy, which can visualize cellular structures without thin sectioning, holds promise for nondestructive 3D pathological examination as a complement of 2D pathology limitation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Liu et al., 2021</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Almagro et al., 2021</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Bishop et al., 2022</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">Serafin et al., 2023</xref>). Various high-speed 3D microscopy techniques have been developed (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Filler and Peuker, 2000</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib42">van Royen et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib43">Verhoef et al., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib46">Yoshitake et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib41">Tao et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Baugh et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">Patel et al., 2022</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib44">Voleti et al., 2019</xref>), and open-top light sheet microscopy (OT-LSM) is a promising technique that enables high-throughput imaging with light sheet illumination and planar imaging on uneven tissue surfaces (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">McGorty et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Glaser et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Glaser et al., 2022</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Gao et al., 2023</xref>). OT-LSM is a specialized form of LSM for large tissue specimens such as biopsy specimens with all the optical components placed below the sample holder. However, fluorescence 3D microscopy techniques including OT-LSM have shallow imaging depths in turbid tissue owing to light scattering and absorption, limiting the applicability of 3D histopathology. As a deep tissue imaging method, two-photon microscopy (TPM) has been used in both biological and optical biopsy studies (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Denk et al., 1990</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib40">So et al., 2000</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Helmchen and Denk, 2005</xref>). TPM is based on nonlinear two-photon excitation of fluorophores and achieves high imaging depths down to a few hundred micrometers by using long excitation wavelengths, which reduce light scattering. Moreover, TPM provides additional intrinsic second harmonic generation (SHG) contrast for visualizing collagen fibers within the extracellular matrix (ECM). This feature proved advantageous for high-contrast imaging of cancer tissue and microenvironmental analysis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib49">Zipfel et al., 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Fast et al., 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">Park et al., 2022</xref>). However, TPM has low imaging speeds due to point scanning-based imaging. To address this limitation, two-photon LSM (TP-LSM) techniques were developed for high-speed imaging (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Fahrbach et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Mahou et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib45">Wolf et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Maioli et al., 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">de Vito et al., 2022</xref>). Although TP-LSM facilitated rapid 3D imaging of cancer cells and zebrafish, its applications were limited to small samples and biological studies due to geometric limitations. Conventional TP-LSM had a configuration of a horizontally oriented illumination objective and a vertically oriented imaging objective. This geometry imposed limitations on the sample size, rendering it unsuitable for the examination of centimeter-scale specimens. TP-LSM with open-top configuration is needed for 3D histological examination.</p><p>In this study, we present the development of an open-top TP-LSM (OT-TP-LSM) with a Bessel beam for high-throughput and high-depth 3D pathological examination of large tissue specimens. A nondiffractive Bessel beam was used and scanned in one-dimensional (1D) to generate an extended depth of field (EDOF) excitation light sheet with minimal side lobe effects (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">Planchon et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Fan et al., 2020</xref>). High imaging depths were achieved by using long excitation wavelengths and fluorescent nuclear probes emitting relatively long wavelengths. After development and characterization, the system was applied to high-throughput 3D imaging of various human cancer specimens, including skin, pancreas, and prostate in comparison with conventional H&amp;E stained histological images for verification. Moreover, OT-TP-LSM images were converted to virtual H&amp;E images using the deep learning-powered style transfer. We demonstrated that OT-TP-LSM images were comparable to histological images of H&amp;E stained slides from several human cancer types, and OT-TP-LSM 3D imaging might have the potential for rapid and accurate nondestructive 3D pathology.</p></sec><sec id="s2" sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><sec id="s2-1"><title>Open-top two-photon light sheet microscopy (OT-TP-LSM) for 3D pathology</title><p>Schematics and characterization results of OT-TP-LSM are presented in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1</xref>. OT-TP-LSM is an orthogonally arranged dual objective LSM with a liquid prism interface (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1A</xref>). All optical components of OT-TP-LSM were positioned underneath a sample holder to accommodate large size specimens without physical interference with the illumination and imaging optics. Two 20x air objective lenses with a moderate numerical aperture (NA) of 0.42 were used to deliver a thin excitation light sheet and to collect emission light efficiently. The custom liquid prism was used to transmit excitation light into the specimen and to collect emission light out with minimal aberration by refractive index (RI) matching with different mediums where the sample was immersed (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1B</xref>). The liquid prism was filled with diluted glycerol in distilled water, whose RI was matched to that of a quartz (RI: 1.45) window in a sample holder. A Ti-Sapphire laser beam was expanded and converted to a Bessel beam using an axicon lens. The Bessel beam was reflected on a galvanometer scanner and relayed to the sample through the liquid prism by a combination of a tube lens and the illumination objective lens. The scanner scanned the Bessel beam to form an EDOF excitation light sheet. Emission light generated by the sample was collected by the imaging objective lens through the liquid prism, split into two channels, one for fluorescence and the other for SHG, using a dichroic mirror, and imaged simultaneously by two scientific complementary metal-oxide–semiconductor (sCMOS) cameras with individual gain control.</p><fig-group><fig id="fig1" position="float"><label>Figure 1.</label><caption><title>Schematics and characteristics of open-top two-photon light sheet microscopy (OT-TP-LSM).</title><p>(<bold>A</bold>) Overall design of OP-TP-LSM.

The imaging field of view was 600 μm × 170 μm with 1,850 × 512 pixels and was limited by the DOF of the Bessel beam. Emission light scattering in the specimen further limited the imaging depth. Selective planar images along the oblique excitation light sheet were acquired sequentially with a stepwise X-axis translation of the specimen by the motorized stage (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1C</xref>). A graphical user interface based on LabVIEW was used to generate trigger signals for both the cameras and the motorized stage. OT-TP-LSM was characterized by imaging fluorescent microspheres (0.5 μm in diameter) embedded in agarose gel, whose RI was matched to that of the solution in the liquid prism (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1D</xref>). The image throughput was 0.24 mm<sup>2</sup>/s at an acquisition rate of 400 fps and step size of 1 μm. The image resolution was measured to be 0.9 μm in all dimensions. The lateral resolution in the Y-Z' plane was approximately 128% of the theoretical value due to spherical aberration induced by the RI mismatch between air and the immersion medium, but this was sufficient for detecting cellular features.</p><p>The imaging depth of OT-TP-LSM was evaluated using freshly excised human skin specimens. Proflavine was topically instilled onto the specimen for nuclear labeling before imaging. A representative Y-Z' plane image is shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1E</xref>. The imaging depth in the skin was approximately 90 μm in the 45°-tilted image plane, and the actual depth was 64 μm from the surface. To compare the imaging depth, the same skin specimen was imaged using conventional one-photon excitation-based LSM (1PLSM). The imaging depth was approximately 28 μm in the 45°-tilted image plane and 20 μm from the surface, which was approximately three times less than that of OT-TP-LSM. While the imaging depth of OT-TP-LSM was sufficient for visualizing 3D cell structures in the skin, it was relatively low compared to that of conventional point-scanning based TPM due to emission photon scattering.</p></sec><sec id="s2-2"><title>3D OT-TP-LSM imaging of human skin cancers</title><p>After development and characterization, the performance of OT-TP-LSM was assessed in human skin cancer specimens. Representative OT-TP-LSM images of two basal cell carcinoma (BCC) specimens are presented along with H&amp;E stained histology images in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2</xref>. The H&amp;E images were obtained from the same specimens at slightly different depths. The OT-TP-LSM images visualized both cell structures and ECM in the cross-sectioned skin specimens, where proflavine-labeled cell nuclei and SHG-emitting collagen were depicted in green and blue, respectively. A mosaic image of the first BCC specimen visualized the epidermis as a thin layer on the top and the underlying dermis, most of which was occupied by BCC nests (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2A</xref>). The epidermis and dermis were easily identifiable with SHG contrasts. Two regions of interest (ROI) were selected in the epidermis and BCC, and magnified images of these ROIs are presented to show the detailed cell structures. Magnified image in the epidermis (ROI 1) showed layered keratinocytes (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2B</xref>). Keratinocytes in the basal layer were relatively large and individually resolved, while those in the upper layers were unresolved and appeared as a band. It could be attributed to the upper layers being comprised of flat cells with relatively small cytoplasm, resulting in little space between nuclei. Additionally, strong autofluorescence signal in the stratum corneum might prevent visualization of the cells in the superficial layer. Magnified images of BCC (ROI 2) showed many irregularly shaped tumor nests composed of densely packed monomorphic tumor cells of the same size (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2C</xref>).</p><fig-group><fig id="fig2" position="float"><label>Figure 2.</label><caption><title>3D OT-TP-LSM images of fresh human skin cancer (basal cell carcinoma, BCC) specimens.</title><p>(<bold>A</bold>) Large-sectional OT-TP-LSM and hematoxylin and eosin (H&amp;E) stained slide images of a BCC case 1.

Magnified images of ROI 3 visualized clusters of small round tubular structures (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2E</xref>). The image at depth 2 showed a ductal structure composed of single-layered cuboidal epithelial cells, which is typical of eccrine glands. Magnified images of ROI 4 at two different depths showed pear-shaped clusters consisting of cells with clear and bulging cytoplasm, which is typical of sebaceous glands (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2F</xref>). Using 3D visualization, normal glandular structures in the dermis were distinguished from BCC tumor nests (<xref ref-type="video" rid="fig2video1">Figure 2—video 1</xref>). Both eccrine and sebaceous glands could appear similar to BCC nests in 2D images at certain depths.

Instead of proflavine, propidium iodide (PI) was used as a nuclear labeling agent to increase the imaging depth (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s1">Figure 3—figure supplement 1</xref>). The proflavine-labeled pancreas specimens had a relatively shallow imaging depth (up to 30 µm approximately) owing to the dense desmoplastic stromal cell composition. PI labeling allowed for deeper imaging up to approximately 55 µm from the surface due to the longer peak emission wavelength of 640 nm compared to proflavine. PI cytoplasmic labeling also occurred in addition to nuclear labeling of both acinar and neoplastic cells, probably owing to PI labeling of both DNA and RNA (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s2">Figure 3—figure supplement 2</xref> ; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">Rieger et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Niu et al., 2015</xref>).

The mosaic image of the normal pancreas visualized a dense distribution of acini composed of exocrine acinar cells in good correlation with the corresponding H&amp;E image (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3A</xref>). Two ROIs were selected, and magnified images are presented to show detailed cytologic features of the normal pancreas. Magnified images of ROI 1 visualized the cellular structure of acini and islets of Langerhans expressing different fluorescence intensities (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3B</xref>). Acini were composed of lobules of acinar cells, and the boundaries of the acini were identified with relatively low PI fluorescence. The islets of Langerhans expressed relatively low PI fluorescence, probably due to the high composition of crystallized insulin in beta cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Lemaire et al., 2012</xref>). Magnified images of ROI 2 visualized a duct in the normal pancreas (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3C</xref>). The duct was composed of single-layered cuboidal epithelial cells with round nuclei and was surrounded by dense fibrous tissue expressing SHG. The mosaic image of the pancreatic premalignant lesion exhibited different and irregular structures, including dilated ducts with intraductal proliferation of papillary structures (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3D</xref>). Two different types of precursor lesions, intraductal papillary mucinous neoplasm (IPMN) and pancreatic intraepithelial neoplasia (PanIN), were observed (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Hruban et al., 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">McGinnis et al., 2020</xref>), and tumor cells were tall columnar containing intracytoplasmic mucin (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Adsay et al., 2004</xref>).

OT-TP-LSM generated a two-photon excitation light sheet using one-dimensional Bessel beam scanning, and planar images were acquired by collecting emission light from the excitation light sheet with sCMOS cameras at 400 fps maximum. Proflavine and PI were used for nuclear labeling and cell structure visualization, and intrinsic SHG contrast was used for ECM visualization. The performance of OT-TP-LSM was characterized in comparison with histopathologic images of H&amp;E stained slides in various human cancer specimens including skin, pancreas, and prostate. 3D OT-TP-LSM images were well matched with the corresponding 2D H&amp;E histological images in all the human tissue specimens evaluated. The relatively high imaging depths of OT-TP-LSM enabled the nondestructive visualization of detailed 3D cell structures with high contrast and without distortion and allowed a distinction between cancer and normal cell structures as well as the detection of cancer invasiveness within tissues. These have been challenging with 2D histological images. The high-quality images of OT-TP-LSM might be partially attributed to the use of the nondiffractive Bessel beam for the generation of an EDOF excitation light sheet (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">Olarte et al., 2012</xref>).</p><p>OT-TP-LSM could visualize 3D cell structures in the skin down to 60 μm deep from the surface by using long wavelength excitation light and proflavine labeling. Although the imaging depth was not high compared to the one of conventional TPM, it was sufficient to visualize 3D cell structures in the skin without sectioning artifacts. The imaging depth varied depending on the tissue type, and the imaging depths of both pancreas and prostate were relatively low in comparison to that of the skin. This low imaging depth could be attributed to the dense cell composition and higher RI than the current immersion medium. To increase the imaging depth, PI with a relatively long emission wavelength was used. Additionally, an immersion medium with 1.5 RI could improve the imaging depth (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib47">Young et al., 2011</xref>), and a quick optical clearing method could also be used to enhance the imaging depth (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Aoyagi et al., 2015</xref>).</p><p>We trained and applied CycleGAN to PI-labeled OT-TP-LSM images of pancreas specimens to generate virtual H&amp;E images, and the cytoplasm and cell nuclei, which exhibited intensity differences in greyscale, were transformed to H&amp;E-like pseudo colors. Virtual H&amp;E images in pancreatic cancer provided histological features equivalent to the conventional H&amp;E. Although CycleGAN showed the potential for virtual H&amp;E staining, further development is needed to have robust performance and universal application. Therefore, CycleGAN will be trained by using more OT-TP-LSM images from various tissue types such as skin and prostate.</p><p>The current OT-TP-LSM has several limitations. One issue is spherical aberration arising from the RI mismatch between the liquid prism and air by using air objective lenses in both illumination and imaging arms. Spherical aberration degraded the image resolution, particularly in the imaging arm. An immersion objective lens with a high NA would be desirable to improve both image resolution and emission light collection efficiency. The excitation light sheet was produced by swiftly scanning a single Bessel beam, yielding a shorter pixel dwell time compared to that of a traditional single-photon 2D light sheet. Employing multiple Bessel beams for excitation light sheet generation would enhance pixel dwell time and image contrast [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Minamikawa et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Chen et al., 2016</xref>]. The relatively short excitation wavelength of 770 nm was used for all the imaging to efficiently collect intrinsic SHG light [20], but the imaging depth was limited. Longer excitation wavelengths with long emission wavelength probes would increase the imaging depth beyond those presented here. Although OT-TP-LSM enabled high-speed 3D imaging, the post-processing time of the OT-TP-LSM image datasets was relatively long due to the large data size, sequential processing of dual channel images, and manual stitching. The long post-processing time needs to be resolved for intraoperative applications. To speed up processing, these processing steps can be performed using field-programmable gate array (FPGA)-based data acquisition with graphics processing unit (GPU)-based computing. The processing time can be further reduced by coding the algorithm in a C++-based environment. Furthermore, ImageJ-based software such as the Bigstitcher plugin can be used for automatic 3D image processing (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Hörl et al., 2019</xref>).</p><p>In conclusion, OT-TP-LSM was developed for high-throughput and high-depth tissue examination. OT-TP-LSM was tested with various human cancers including skin, pancreas, and prostate by visualizing 3D cell structures. Intrinsic SHG contrast was used for visualizing ECM and detecting fibrosis. Normal glands and BCC nests were clearly distinguished, and both pancreatic and prostate cancers were clearly identified using 3D visualization of cell structures with OT-TP-LSM. Furthermore, virtual H&amp;E staining of OT-TP-LSM using CycleGAN provided histopathologic information comparable to that from H&amp;E stained slides. Therefore, OT-TP-LSM could be useful for rapid and precise nondestructive 3D pathology.</p></sec><sec id="s4" sec-type="materials|methods"><title>Materials and methods</title><sec id="s4-1"><title>OT-TP-LSM setup</title><p>The schematics of OT-TP-LSM are shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1A</xref>. As the light source, OT-TP-LSM used a titanium–sapphire pulse laser (Chameleon II, Coherent) with 140-fs pulse width and 80-MHz pulse repetition rate. The excitation wavelength was set at 770 nm for imaging human tissue specimens. In the illumination arm, the laser beam was expanded from 1.4 mm to 1.86 mm and then converted to a Bessel beam by using an axicon lens (131-1270 + ARB825, Eksma). The Bessel beam was relayed onto the specimen through two lens pairs of L1 (AC254-045-B, Thorlabs) and L2 (AC254-080-B, Thorlabs), and L3 (AC254-150-B, Thorlabs) and a 20× air illumination objective lens with 0.42 NA (MY20X-804, Mitutoyo). The Bessel beam diameter at the back aperture of the objective lens was approximately 6.8 mm to prevent beam clipping, and the effective illumination NA was 0.34. The excitation light sheet was generated by Y-axis scanning of the Bessel beam with a galvanometric scanner (GVS102, Thorlabs), which was positioned between L1 and L2. The liquid prism transmitted the excitation light normally through a coverslip (HSU-0101122, Marienfeld Superior), RI-matching solution, and a 0.25 mm thick round quartz window (26043, Ted Pella) at the bottom of the sample holder, and then to the sample (Fig. 1B). Diluted 85% glycerol (Samchun) in distilled water was used for RI-matching with the quartz window (RI: 1.45). The sample holder was connected to an x-y motorized translation stage (XY MS-2000, Applied Scientific Instrumentation) for sample translation during imaging. To remove air gaps between the quartz window of the sample holder and irregular-shaped tissue specimen, the specimen was partially immersed in the RI-matching solution and light pressure was applied on the top of the specimen. In the imaging arm, emission light was collected by the imaging objective lens (MY20X-804, Mitutoyo) through the liquid prism, spectrally separated into two channels by a dichroic mirror (T425lpxr, Chroma), and collected at two sCMOS cameras (pco-edge 4.2, PCO) after passing through a tube lens (AC254-200-A, Thorlabs), respectively. SHG light was collected in the short pass channel with an emission filter (ET376/30x, Chroma), and fluorescence was collected in the long pass channel with an emission filter (ET680SP, Chroma). Both fluorescence and SHG images were simultaneously acquired with individual gain control.</p></sec><sec id="s4-2"><title>Human skin cancer specimen collection and imaging protocol</title><p>Fresh skin cancer specimens were collected under the Institutional Review Board (IRB) of Yonsei University, Severance Hospital, approved protocol (approval # 4-2021-0128).

To speed up processing, these processing steps can be performed using field-programmable gate array (FPGA)-based data acquisition with graphics processing unit (GPU)-based computing.

We would like to thank the reviewer for the critical and positive comments. 3D pathology has been a long-standing research direction. The current pathology is 2D by examining H&amp;E histology slides which were generated by thin sectioning biopsied and surgical specimens at different depths. The reliability of the pathological diagnosis suffers from under sampling of specimens. Although 3D pathology is possible by serial thin-sectioning, imaging, and then combining the images in 3D, it is not practice for clinical use due to the required labor and time.</p><p>We demonstrated the advantages of OT-TP-LSM in various human cancer tissues. The relatively high imaging depths of OT-TP-LSM enabled the nondestructive visualization of detailed 3D cell structures with high contrast and without distortion and allowed a distinction between cancer and normal cell structures as well as the detection of cancer invasiveness within tissues. We revised the manuscript to explain the benefits of 3D pathology with OT-TP-LSM.</p><p>C2-1.

Both eccrine and sebaceous glands could appear similar to BCC nests in 2D images at certain depths. Hence, nondestructive 3D visualization of cell structures would be important for distinguishing them, serving as a complement to the traditional 2D H&amp;E images.</p><p>C2-2.

An irregular and distorted architecture amidst desmoplastic stroma is one of the important diagnostic factors for PDAC [35]. The cancer glands exhibited disorganized cancer cell arrangement with nuclear membrane distortion. Magnified images of ROI 2 showed both nonneoplastic ducts and cancer glands in different cell arrangements (Figure 4C). The nonneoplastic ducts showed single-layered epithelium with small, evenly distributed cells expressing relatively high nuclear fluorescence. Cancer glands, on the other hand, had disorganized and multilayered structure with large nuclei. OT-TP-LSM visualized the 3D invasiveness of cancer glands within tissues nondestructively, which could not be identified from limited 2D information.</p><p>C2-3.

Revised manuscript, introduction, page 4 and lines 56-64Precise intraoperative cancer diagnosis is crucial for achieving optimal patient outcomes by enabling complete tumor removal. The standard method is the microscopic cellular examination of surgically excised specimens following various processing steps, including thin sectioning and hematoxylin and eosin (H&amp;E) cell staining. However, this examination method is laborious and time-consuming. Furthermore, it has inherent artifacts that disturb accurate diagnosis, including tissue loss, limited two-dimensional (2D) information, and sampling error [1]. High-speed three-dimensional (3D) optical microscopy, which can visualize cellular structures without thin sectioning, holds promise for nondestructive 3D pathological examination as a complement of 2D pathology limitation [1-4].</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>A4.

As suggested by the reviewer, we added a brief introduction about the cited studies.</p><p>C4. Revised manuscript, introduction, pages 4-5 and lines 71-82</p><p>As a deep tissue imaging method, two-photon microscopy (TPM) has been used in both biological and optical biopsy studies [17-19]. TPM is based on nonlinear two-photon excitation of fluorophores and achieves high imaging depths down to a few hundred micrometers by using long excitation wavelengths, which reduce light scattering. Moreover, TPM provides additional intrinsic second harmonic generation (SHG) contrast for visualizing collagen fibers within the extracellular matrix (ECM). This feature proved advantageous for high-contrast imaging of cancer tissue and microenvironmental analysis [20-22]. However, TPM has low imaging speeds due to point scanning-based imaging. To address this limitation, two-photon LSM (TP-LSM) techniques were developed for high-speed imaging [23-27]. Although TP-LSM facilitated rapid 3D imaging of cancer cells and zebrafish, its applications were limited to small samples and biological studies due to geometric limitations.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>A5. Line 72: Please mention the importance and benefit of having an open-top configuration. I think this is one of the key aspects that provide a high imaging depth in OT-LP-LSM.</p></disp-quote><p>B5. We would like to thank the reviewer for the comment. Conventional LSM techniques including TP-LSM have a configuration in which the illumination objective is oriented in the horizontal plane and imaging is performed with orthogonally arranged objectives. However, this geometry limited lateral sample size physically and it is unsuitable to image centimeter-scale large tissue. Therefore, we developed OT-TP-LSM for 3D large tissue examination. High imaging depths were achieved with long excitation wavelengths and long emission wavelengths of fluorophores. The open-top configuration does not contribute to the improvement of imaging depth. We revised the manuscript to explain the need for open-top configuration.</p><p>C5. Revised manuscript, introduction, page 5 and lines 82-86</p><p>Conventional TP-LSM had a configuration of a horizontally oriented illumination objective and a vertically oriented imaging objective. This geometry imposed limitations on the sample size, rendering it unsuitable for the examination of centimeter-scale specimens.

Line 78: It would be nice to clearly quantify the imaging depth here.</p></disp-quote><p>B6. We would like to thank the reviewer for the comment.

Line 146: Please clearly explain the reason why the upper layers are not resolved.</p></disp-quote><p>B7. We would like to thank the reviewer for the comment and we are sorry for the missing information. The skin epidermis has various cell layers and superficial layers are composed of less rounded and flat cells with relatively small cytoplasm. Therefore, cells in that layer could be difficult to resolve with the current system resolution because there is little space between nuclei. Additionally, strong autofluorescence signal in the stratum corneum could be the reason for preventing visualization of the cells in the superficial layer. We revised the manuscript to explain the reasons in detail.</p><p>C7. Revised manuscript, Results, 3D OT-TP-LSM imaging of human skin cancers, page 8 and lines 159-163</p><p>Keratinocytes in the basal layer were relatively large and individually resolved, while those in the upper layers were unresolved and appeared as a band. It could be attributed to the upper layers being comprised of flat cells with relatively small cytoplasm, resulting in little space between nuclei. Additionally, strong autofluorescence signal in the stratum corneum might prevent visualization of the cells in the superficial layer.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>A8. Line 253: Please explain the importance of visualization of 3D cell structures in cancer pathology.

As answered in A2, the current H&amp;E histological examination has inherent limitations due to limited 2D information and sampling errors. To resolve this, OT-TP-LSM was developed for the visualization of 3D cell structures nondestructively as a complement to traditional slide-based 2D pathology. We demonstrated the advantages of OT-TP-LSM in various human cancer tissues. The relatively high imaging depths of OT-TP-LSM enabled the nondestructive visualization of detailed 3D cell structures with high contrast and without distortion and allowed a distinction between cancer and normal cell structures as well as the detection of cancer invasiveness within tissues. We revised the manuscript to explain the benefits of 3D pathology with OT-TP-LSM.</p><p>C8. Please refer to the answer in C2-1 – C2-5.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>A9. Figures: Please clearly mark the cancer regions in the images as indicated in Figure 5. It will help the reader to easily compare the healthy and invaded tissue parts.</p></disp-quote><p>B9. We would like to thank the reviewer for the comment. We confirmed that the cancer area is not marked in Figure 4 of the pancreatic cancer tissue. We modified Figure 4 to mark the cancer region. Additionally, Figure 2 of the skin cancer tissue was also modified in this regard.</p><p>C9.
