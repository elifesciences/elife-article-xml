Flaccid Myelitis. Here, we show that the histone deacetylase, SIRT-1, is essential for autophagy and EV-D68 infection. Knockdown of SIRT-1 inhibits autophagy and reduces EV-D68 extracellular titers. The proviral activity of SIRT-1 does not require its deacetylase activity or functional autophagy. SIRT-1’s proviral activity is, we demonstrate, mediated through the repression of endoplasmic reticulum stress (ER stress). Inducing ER stress through thapsigargin treatment or SERCA2A knockdown in SIRT-1 knockdown cells had no additional effect on EV-D68 extracellular titers. Knockdown of SIRT-1 also decreases poliovirus and SARS-CoV-2 titers but not coxsackievirus B3. In non-lytic conditions, EV-D68 is primarily released in an enveloped form, and SIRT-1 is required for this process. Our data show that SIRT-1, through its translocation to the cytosol, is critical to promote the release of enveloped EV-D68 viral particles.</p></abstract><kwd-group kwd-group-type="author-keywords"><kwd>enterovirus D68</kwd><kwd>SIRT-1</kwd><kwd>autophagy</kwd><kwd>ER stress</kwd></kwd-group><kwd-group kwd-group-type="research-organism"><title>Research organism</title><kwd>Human</kwd></kwd-group><funding-group><award-group id="fund1"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000060</institution-id><institution>National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>R01141359</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Jassey</surname><given-names>Alagie</given-names></name><name><surname>Miller</surname><given-names>Katelyn</given-names></name><name><surname>Jackson</surname><given-names>William T</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund2"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000060</institution-id><institution>National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>R01104928</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Wagner</surname><given-names>Michael A</given-names></name><name><surname>Galitska</surname><given-names>Ganna</given-names></name><name><surname>Jackson</surname><given-names>William T</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund3"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000060</institution-id><institution>National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>R21158134</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Logue</surname><given-names>James</given-names></name><name><surname>Weston</surname><given-names>Stuart</given-names></name><name><surname>Frieman</surname><given-names>Matthew</given-names></name><name><surname>Jackson</surname><given-names>William T</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><funding-statement>The funders had no role in study design, data collection, and interpretation, or the decision to submit the work for publication.</funding-statement></funding-group><custom-meta-group><custom-meta specific-use="meta-only"><meta-name>Author impact statement</meta-name><meta-value>Enterovirus D68, a pathogen associated with a rare child paralysis disease, depends on the cellular protein SIRT-1 for release of virus, indicating that SIRT-1 may be an important therapeutic target.</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta specific-use="meta-only"><meta-name>publishing-route</meta-name><meta-value>prc</meta-value></custom-meta></custom-meta-group></article-meta></front><body><sec id="s1" sec-type="intro"><title>Introduction</title><p>Enterovirus D68 (EV-D68) is a re-emerging enterovirus and a cause of acute respiratory illness in infants. EV-D68 infection has recently been associated with Acute Flaccid Myelitis, a severe polio-like neurological disease that causes limb weakness and loss of muscle tone in infants (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Eshaghi et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Lang et al., 2014</xref>). There is currently no FDA-approved drug or vaccine against EV-D68. It is important to understand how EV-D68 hijacks host processes to facilitate its life cycle within the host.</p><p>EV-D68 is a positive-sense single-stranded RNA enterovirus belonging to the <italic>Piconarviridae</italic> family. The viral genome encodes a single polyprotein that is immediately processed upon translation by viral proteases into multiple intermediate and mature structural and seven non-structural proteins (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Esposito et al., 2015</xref>). Enterovirus infection induces extensive rearrangement of cytosolic membranes, beginning with the formation of complex single convoluted membranes, also known as replication vesicles, on the cytosolic face of which viral RNA replication occurs. For most enteroviruses, these intricate structures eventually morph into double-membrane autophagosome-like structures, which play roles in virus replication, maturation, and non-lytic release (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Jackson, 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Jackson et al., 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">Shi and Luo, 2012</xref>).</p><p>Autophagy is a highly regulated catabolic process that maintains cell survival by targeting superfluous cytoplasmic contents and infectious microorganisms, including pathogenic bacteria and viruses, for degradation. Several RNA viruses, including EV-D68, are known to subvert autophagy for their own benefit, and our interest in this pathway led us to study sirtuin 1 (SIRT-1) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Ahmad et al., 2018</xref>). SIRT-1 is important for autophagy initiation, but whether SIRT-1 is essential for the later stages of autophagy (autophagic flux) or translocates to the cytosol during starvation or other stress stimuli, such as viral infection, is unknown (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Bai and Zhang, 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Huang et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Lee et al., 2008</xref>). A growing body of evidence implicates SIRT-1 as an essential regulator of autophagy downstream of the nucleation complex (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Green and Levine, 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Huang et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Lee et al., 2008</xref>).</p><p>SIRT-1 belongs to the NAD<sup>+</sup>-dependent family of histone deacetylase enzymes, which are known to control several physiological processes. The sirtuin family of enzymes contains seven members (SIRT-1–7), which display varying subcellular localization, with SIRT-1 being the most studied owing to its role in lifespan expansion (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Chalkiadaki and Guarente, 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Jing and Lin, 2015</xref>). SIRT-1 has been shown to regulate cellular responses to various stresses, including the cell cycle, apoptosis, inflammation, endoplasmic reticulum stress (ER stress), and more (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Chalkiadaki and Guarente, 2015</xref>). SIRT-1 has also been shown to promote the Middle East respiratory syndrome coronavirus infection, but whether SIRT-1 regulates picornavirus infection is unknown (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib43">Weston et al., 2019</xref>).</p><p>A less well-known or studied role for SIRT-1 is in regulating ER stress (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Li et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">Singh et al., 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib40">Tang et al., 2018</xref>). ER stress, which can be provoked by various stress stimuli, including viral infection, happens when proteins cannot properly fold, leading to the accumulation of unfolded/misfolded protein. ER stress engages the unfolded protein response (UPR), which attenuates transcription and translation, decreases protein synthesis, and enhances the expression of molecular chaperones to increase the cell’s protein folding capacity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">Oslowski and Urano, 2011</xref>). The inositol-requiring enzyme (IRE) 1-X-box-binding protein (XBP) 1 pathway constitutes one of the three major pathways induced by UPR (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Hetz, 2012</xref>). Upon ER stress, IRE-1 cleaves XBP-1 mRNA into spliced forms which, in turn, activates UPR target genes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib46">Yoshida et al., 2001</xref>). Studies have shown an intricate interplay between SIRT-1 and ER stress. While SIRT-1 regulates ER stress by binding and inhibiting the transcriptional activity of XBP1, ER stress also regulates SIRT-1 levels (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib41">Wang et al., 2011</xref>). For instance, ER stress induction through thapsigargin (TG) treatment induces SIRT-1 protein levels in vivo and in vitro to promote hepatocellular injury (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Koga et al., 2015</xref>).</p><p>Here, we report that EV-D68 infection induces SIRT-1 translocation to the cytosol. We also show that SIRT knockdown impedes the extracellular vesicle-mediated release of infectious EV-D68 particles. We further demonstrate that the pro-EV-D68 activity of SIRT-1 is mediated through repressing ER stress and does not require SIRT-1’s deacetylase function, nor is it dependent on functional autophagy. Moreover, SIRT-1 knockdown reduces extracellular titers of poliovirus (PV) and SARS-CoV-2 but not coxsackievirus B3 (CVB3). Our results indicate that certain enteroviruses induce SIRT-1 translocation to the cytosol and require the cellular protein for efficient release.</p></sec><sec id="s2" sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><sec id="s2-1"><title>EV-D68 infection changes SIRT-1’s subcellular localization</title><p>SIRT-1 is proviral in some cases and has previously been reported to regulate autophagy initiation, which is important for EV-D68 infection (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Huang et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Lee et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib43">Weston et al., 2019</xref>). But whether SIRT-1 is essential for EV-D68 reproduction is unknown. We first interrogated the effects of SIRT-1 knockdown on EV-D68 titers. SIRT-1 knockdown reduced both the intracellular (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1A</xref>) and extracellular (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1B</xref>) EV-D68 titers, with the knockdown being more effective in decreasing the extracellular titers than the cell-associated viral titers. Pharmacological inhibition of SIRT-1, through EX527 pretreatment, yielded similar results (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1A, B</xref>). Next, we assessed the effect of SIRT-1 overexpression on EV-D68 titers. Both wild-type (SIRT-1 WT) and the deacetylase inactive mutant (SIRT-1 H363Y) increased EV-D68 extracellular titers (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1C</xref>). Furthermore, overexpression of both wild-type and mutant SIRT-1 constructs partially rescued EV-D68 extracellular titers in SIRT-1 knockdown cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1C</xref>), indicating that the pro-EV-D68 activity of SIRT-1 does not require its deacetylase function.</p><fig-group><fig id="fig1" position="float"><label>Figure 1.</label><caption><title>Enterovirus D68 (EV-D68) infection changes SIRT-1’s subcellular localization.</title><p>H1HeLa cells were transfected with either scramble control or SIRT-1 siRNAs for 48 hr.

We infected H1HeLa cells for various time points before subjecting the cells to immunofluorescence analysis (IFA) against SIRT-1. As indicated in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1D</xref>, SIRT-1 is localized to the nucleus in the mock-infected cells. EV-D68 infection, on the other hand, induced translocation of a fraction of SIRT-1 to the cytosol (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1D</xref>) beginning at 3 hpi, which coincides with peak viral RNA replication. Interestingly, EV71 has also been reported to induce SIRT-1 relocalization to the cytosol during infection (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Han et al., 2016</xref>). To understand whether SIRT-1 translocation during EV-D68 infection is dependent on exportin-1, the major mammalian nuclear export protein, we pretreated H1HeLa cells with and without leptomycin-B, a specific exportin-1 inhibitor, followed by EV-D68 infection (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Fornerod et al., 1997</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Fukuda et al., 1997</xref>). Leptomycin-B treatment inhibited transcription factor-EB, the master transcriptional regulator of autophagy translocation upon refeeding, as expected (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s2">Figure 1—figure supplement 2A</xref>), but it did not obstruct SIRT-1 translocation induced by EV-D68 infection (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s2">Figure 1—figure supplement 2B</xref>). In some cases, cleavage of nuclear pore proteins by enteroviruses has been shown to cause leakage of proteins from the nucleus during infection (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Gustin and Sarnow, 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Hanson et al., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib42">Watters et al., 2017</xref>). However, we found that the autophagy kinase regulator RB1CC1 does not leave the nucleus during EV-D68 infection, indicating that SIRT-1 is being targeted for translocation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s3">Figure 1—figure supplement 3</xref>).

Together, these results show that SIRT-1 is essential for stress-induced and basal autophagy.</p><p>Given SIRT-1’s regulation of autophagy, we asked whether SIRT-1’s proviral activity depends on functional autophagy. SIRT-1, which is typically localized to the nucleus in cancer cells, forms a molecular complex with three proteins essential for autophagy initiation: ATG-5, ATG-7, and LC3. SIRT-1 deacetylates these autophagy-related proteins, thereby regulating autophagy induction (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Bai and Zhang, 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Lee et al., 2008</xref>). We first examined whether SIRT-1 colocalizes with ATG-7 during EV-D68 infection. As shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2E</xref>, EV-D68 induces ATG-7 puncta formation, which partially colocalizes with SIRT-1. We next examined the effect of ATG-7 knockout (ATG-7 KO), which cannot form autophagosomes, on EV-D68 release. ATG-7 KO severely impeded both extracellular and vesicle-mediated release of EV-D68 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2C</xref>), consistent with the importance of autophagy for picornavirus release (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Jackson, 2014</xref>). We then knocked down SIRT-1 in ATG-7 knockout (ATG-7 KO) cells, then infected these cells with EV-D68. Knockdown of SIRT-1 decreased EV-D68 extracellular titers in ATG-7 KO cells without significantly altering the intracellular titers (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2D</xref>), suggesting that the proviral function of SIRT-1 does not require functional autophagy. Since SIRT-1 regulates autophagy through its deacetylase activity, these data are consistent with our findings in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1</xref>.</p></sec><sec id="s2-3"><title>SIRT-1’s proviral activity is mediated by repressing ER stress</title><p>SIRT-1 has previously been reported to negatively regulate ER stress by deacetylating X-box-binding protein-1 (XBP1) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib41">Wang et al., 2011</xref>). To determine whether SIRT-1’s proviral activity is mediated via ER stress, we treated H1HeLa cells with or without TG, a well-known ER stress inducer, for 5 hr after viral adsorption. TG provokes ER stress by inhibiting the Sarco/endoplasmic reticulum Ca<sup>2+</sup>-ATPase pump (SERCA), which mediates calcium transfer from the cytosol to the lumen of the ER, and is important for maintaining ER homeostasis. While TG treatment only marginally reduced EV-D68 intracellular titers, it markedly decreased the extracellular titers (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3A</xref>), similar to what we observed in SIRT-1 knockdown cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1A, B</xref>). This finding suggests that TG and SIRT-1 may share common cellular targets. To test this hypothesis, we treated scramble and SIRT-1 knockdown cells with and without TG after viral adsorption. TG treatment significantly reduced viral extracellular titers in the scramble control group. In contrast, TG did not significantly alter viral extracellular titers when SIRT-1 is depleted (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3B</xref>).

Therefore, identifying host factors that influence the infection of these viruses could help control their infection.

As shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7A</xref>, EV-D68 appears to be released chiefly in EVs compared to the post-spin supernatant (PSS), and SIRT-1 knockdown severely impeded the extracellular vesicle-mediated release of EV-D68.

In addition, we show that most EV-D68 is released non-lytically in an enveloped form, and that knockdown or pharmacological inhibition of SIRT-1 severely decreases the release of infectious enveloped EV-D68 particles. Knockdown of SIRT-1 also attenuates the release of PV and SARS-CoV-2 but marginally increases CVB3 egress (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figures 5C, E</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">6C</xref>). Our results suggest that many viruses induce SIRT-1 translocation to the cytosol to promote their vesicular release. Interestingly, our genetic and pharmacological data lead us to conclude that SIRT-1 is not acting to promote virus release through autophagy, nor through histone deacetylation, but through a mechanism related to ER stress.</p><p>We observed that EV-D68 infection induces relocalization of SIRT-1 from the nucleus to the cytosol starting at 3 hpi (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1D</xref>). Given that RNA replication peaks at 3 hpi, we initially thought SIRT-1 might be essential for viral RNA replication. However, during EV-D68 infection, SIRT-1 did not colocalize to dsRNA, a marker of active viral RNA replication (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7s1">Figure 7—figure supplement 1A</xref>). In contrast, GBF-1, a cellular factor that is required for enterovirus replication, colocalizes with dsRNA during EV-D68 infection (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7s1">Figure 7—figure supplement 1B</xref>). The kinetic studies in our supplemental data revealed that starvation induces rapid SIRT-1 translocation to the cytosol as early as 1 hr post-treatment (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s1">Figure 2—figure supplement 1A</xref>). This finding is consistent with the notion that SIRT-1 drives autophagosome formation during amino acid starvation. Although starvation slightly decreased SIRT-1 protein levels by western blot, pharmacological inhibition of autophagic flux failed to restore SIRT-1 levels. Moreover, SIRT-1 did not colocalize with p62 in starved cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s1">Figure 2—figure supplement 1B</xref>), suggesting that the cellular protein is not a substrate for autophagy.</p><p>We found that SIRT-1 knockdown did not significantly impact EV-D68 RNA replication (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7s1">Figure 7—figure supplement 1C</xref>), virus binding (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7s1">Figure 7—figure supplement 1D</xref>), or virus entry (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7s1">Figure 7—figure supplement 1E</xref>). Instead, our findings suggest that the effect of SIRT-1 on virus production can largely be explained by a role in re-configuring the exocytosis pathway to promote the release of virus-loaded EVs. Knockdown of SIRT-1 led to the accumulation of large CD63-positive puncta in cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7D</xref>), suggesting that the turnover, or the release, of these vesicles is downregulated in the absence of SIRT-1. Infection results in an increase in CD63 in the extracellular vesicles. Interestingly, our western blot data show a marked decrease in CD63 and a complete lack of VP3 detection in EVs from infected cells with reduced SIRT-1 expression (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7C</xref>). This finding, coupled with the increased CD63 in the whole-cell lysates (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7B, C</xref>), indicates that the reduction of SIRT-1 attenuates the release of virus-loaded CD63-positive EVs.</p><p>While enteroviruses are thought to be mainly released by cell lysis, a growing body of evidence indicates that these viruses can be released from intact cells without cell lysis, a phenomenon called non-lytic release. For instance, PV has been shown to escape intact cells through AWOL (autophagosome-mediated exit without lysis), in which virus-containing autophagosomes fuse with the plasma membrane to release virions (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Jackson et al., 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">Richards and Jackson, 2012</xref>).

Hepatitis A virus (HAV), which is non-lytic, has been reported to exit cells in an enveloped form known as eHAV (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Feng et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Rivera-Serrano et al., 2019</xref>). Similar events, modulated through the autophagic pathway, have been shown for multiple enteroviruses (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Chen et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">Robinson et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">Sin et al., 2017</xref>). We show here for the first time that EV-D68 can also exit intact cells non-lytically in EVs. This extracellular vesicle-mediated release of EV-D68 virions is, as we demonstrate here, dependent upon SIRT-1, a protein best known as a histone deacetylase and autophagy regulator (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7A</xref>). However, our data suggest that SIRT-1’s proviral activity is mediated through a role in repressing ER stress.</p><p>Studies have shown that SIRT-1 negatively regulates crucial ER stress-related proteins, including XBP1 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib41">Wang et al., 2011</xref>). Therefore, knocking down SIRT-1 would be expected to permit ER stress induction, which, in turn, could attenuate EV-D68 non-lytic release. Consistent with this presumption, provoking ER stress through TG treatment, similar to SIRT-1 knockdown, markedly decreases EV-D68 extracellular titers in both H1HeLa and hSABCi cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figures 3A</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">4A</xref>). Our drug-based epistasis analysis revealed that SIRT-1 and TG share common cellular targets since TG did not further reduce viral titers in SIRT-1 knockdown cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3B</xref>).</p><p>Since TG binds SERCA2A and downregulates its activity leading to ER stress (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Lytton et al., 1991</xref>), we investigated whether depleting SERCA2A will impact EV-D68 extracellular titers. As anticipated, knocking down SERCA2A reduces EV-D68 release. However, double knockdown of SIRT-1 and SERCA2A failed to appreciably decrease viral titers compared to SERCA2A or SIRT-1 knockdowns alone, indicating SERCA2A is a downstream target of SIRT-1. Intriguingly, we observed that the knockdown of SIRT-1 concomitantly reduced SERCA2A protein levels (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3E</xref>), which is in agreement with a previous study (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Gorski et al., 2019</xref>). Therefore, knocking down SIRT-1 decreases SERCA2A levels, allowing ER stress induction and decreasing EV-D68 release.</p><p>TG has been demonstrated to possess antiviral activity against many viruses using various mechanisms. For instance, TG attenuates Peste des petits ruminantsvirus (PPRV) and Newcastle disease virus (NDV) infection by restricting viral entry and viral protein synthesis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Kumar et al., 2019</xref>). In contrast, TG inhibits respiratory viruses such as Influenza and coronaviruses by provoking a robust interferon response (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Al-Beltagi et al., 2021</xref>). Here, for the first time, we demonstrate that TG also inhibits EV-D68 infection (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figures 3A</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">4A</xref>). TG’s anti-EV-D68 activity seems unlikely to involve inhibition of viral entry, viral RNA replication, or inducing the type 1 interferon response since the drug treatment only marginally reduced EV-D68 intracellular titers (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figures 3A</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">4A</xref>). Instead, TG’s anti-EV-D68 activity involves limiting the non-lytic release of EV-D68 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figures 3A</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">4A</xref>).</p><p>Although exactly how TG attenuates EV-D68 non-lytic release is unclear, we hypothesize that TG reduces EV-D68 non-lytic release by inducing ER Stress. Consistent with this hypothesis, the knockdown of SERCA2A, which induces ER stress, also reduces EV-D68 release (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3D</xref>). Since EV-D68 infection inhibits ER stress, as indicated by the decrease in XBP1 and BiP protein levels, and the lack of BiP induction when EV-D68-infected cells were treated with TG (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figures 3F</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">4B</xref>), this suggests that ER stress is detrimental to EV-D68 release. Although we did not observe specific XBP1 or BiP cleavage products during EV-D68 infection, a recent study showed that PV and CVB3 induce cleavage of XBP1 at late time points during their infection (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">Shishova et al., 2022</xref>). However, the study did not determine the specific mechanism of XBP1 cleavage. Nonetheless, decreasing full-length XBP1 and BiP levels during infection may be a common strategy employed by enterovirus to avoid ER stress, which, as we have shown, is a negative for non-lytic release. While SIRT-1 is thought to negatively regulate ER stress by deacetylating XBP1, we found that the deacetylase inactive mutant (SIRT-1 H363Y) increased EV-D68 release (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1C</xref>). This suggests a non-deacetylase role of SIRT-1 in ER stress, at least during enterovirus infection.</p><p>SIRT-1 was previously demonstrated to be essential for MERS-CoV infection (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib43">Weston et al., 2019</xref>). Here, we demonstrate that the cellular protein is also crucial for SARS-CoV-2 infection. Our data show that, much like in the MERS-CoV study, the knockdown of SIRT-1 decreases SARS-CoV-2 release (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6C</xref>), suggesting that SIRT-1 may be a shared host factor utilized by many Betacoronaviruses.</p><p>Our data show that a portion of nuclear SIRT-1 relocalizes to the cytosol upon infection by EV-D68 and PV (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figures 1D</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">4D,</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">5A</xref>). We also observe that SARS-CoV-2 infection causes SIRT-1 translocation to the cytosol (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6A</xref>). These viruses require SIRT-1 for normal virus release. It will be interesting to examine whether other Betacoronaviruses alter the subcellular localization of SIRT-1 and whether SIRT-1 is important for their infection.</p><p>CVB3, which does not require SIRT-1, also fails to induce relocalization of the protein (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5A</xref>). This, along with the finding that SIRT-1 is found on virus-induced extracellular vesicles, suggests to us a central role for SIRT-1 in constructing virus-containing vesicles for extracellular release – but only for some viruses. Why at least one enterovirus has evolved a SIRT-1-independent mechanism for release and what the mechanism might be will help understand how to target-specific viruses or broad classes of viruses to prevent their release from infected cells. While we believe SIRT-1 is a common regulator of virus release, it is not a universal one. Future work identifying a homolog, or paralog, protein playing a parallel role in CVB3 release, and understanding the relationship of CVB3 to ER stress, will undoubtedly shed light on the differences between these otherwise similar viruses.</p><p>In summary, our data show that SIRT-1 is essential for basal- and stress-induced autophagy and EV-mediated non-lytic release of EV-D68. We also demonstrated that SIRT-1 is crucial for releasing other important public health viruses, including SARS-CoV-2 and PV, indicating that SIRT-1 may be a common host factor regulating multiple viruses’ release. Understanding how SIRT-1 regulates viral egress could open avenues for therapeutic intervention against many viruses.</p></sec><sec id="s4" sec-type="materials|methods"><title>Materials and methods</title><sec id="s4-1"><title>Cell culture, plasmids, and viruses</title><p>H1HeLa cells were purchased from ATCC (CRL-1958) and cultured in Dulbecco’s Modified Eagle Medium (DMEM) supplemented with 10% fetal bovine saline, 1× penicillin/streptomycin, and 1× sodium pyruvate.

SIRT-1 is an NAD-dependent protein deacetylase that has numerous and wide ranging effects on cellular physiology and homeostasis, and it is known to be engaged in cellular responses to stress and autophagy.</p><p>Jassey et al. show that RNAi depletion of SIRT-1 impairs the release of enterovirus D-68 (EV-D68) in EVs recovered from the supernatant fluids of infected cells using a commercial exosome isolation kit. The many functions attributed to SIRT-1 in the literature reflect its capacity to deacetylate various cell proteins engaged in transcription, DNA repair, and regulation of metabolism, apoptosis and autophagy. However, Jassey et al. make the surprising claim that the proviral role of SIRT-1 in promoting enterovirus release is not dependent on its deacetylase activity. Fig. S1C is crucial to this suggestion but it is less than completely convincing. It shows that both wild-type and mutant SIRT-1are massively over-expressed in the rescue experiment compared to the normal endogenous level of SIRT-1 expression. Moreover, the blots are heavily saturated, making it difficult to assess the relative expression of wild-type vs. mutant. In addition, Fig. S1B and Fig. 4C convincingly show that EX527, a small molecule inhibitor of the deacetylase activity of SIRT-1, inhibits extracellular release of the virus. This suggests that the deacetylase activity of SIRT-1 may in fact be required for the proviral effect of SIRT-1. This is a fundamentally important question that requires more investigation.</p><p>Fig. 6 shows how SIRT-1 knockdown impacts the release of enterovirus D68 in EVs recovered from cell culture supernatant using a commercial 'Total Exosome Isolation Kit'. The authors are appropriately cautious in describing the vesicles they presume to be isolated by the kit as simply 'extracellular vesicles', since there are multiple types of EVs with very different mechanisms of biogenesis, of which 'exosomes' are but one specific type. It would have been more elegant had the authors shown that SIRT-1 is required for EV-D68 release in detergent-sensitive vesicles with low buoyant density in isopycnic gradients, and to characterize the size and number of viral capsids in these vesicles by electron microscopy.</p><p>The authors claim that &quot;reduction of SIRT-1 attenuates the release of virus-loaded CD63-positive EVs&quot; but they never actually show that the vesicles containing EV-D68 are in fact CD63-positive. Can a CD63 pulldown immunoprecipitate EV-D68 capsid proteins or viral RNA? This is important since CD63 is strongly associated with exosomes released from cells through the multi-vesicular body pathway, which are distinct from the LC3-positive EVs released by secretory autophagy that have previously been associated with enteroviruses.</p><p>The authors claim &quot;that most EV-D68 is released non-lytically in an enveloped form&quot; but they show data from only from early time points following infection (5 or 6 hrs post-infection) - prior to cell lysis. It would have been interesting to see a more complete temporal analysis, and to know the overall proportion of virus released in EVs versus lytic release of nonenveloped virus.</p><p>Fig. 1D indicates that a small fraction of SIRT-1 leaks from the nucleus in EV-D68 infected cells. The authors suggest this is due to targeted nuclear export, rather than simply leaky nuclear pores which are well known to exist in enterovirus-infected cells, but the evidence for this is questionable. The authors present similar fluorescent microscopy data showing inhibition of TFEB export in leptomycin-B treated cells in Fig. S2A in support of their claim that there is specific SIRT-1 export, but there is equivalent residual TFEB and SIRT-1 in the cytoplasm of the treated cells. Quantitative immunoblots of cytoplasmic and nuclear cell fractions might prove more compelling.</p></body></sub-article><sub-article article-type="author-comment" id="sa2"><front-stub><article-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.87993.3.sa2</article-id><title-group><article-title>Author Response</article-title></title-group><contrib-group><contrib contrib-type="author"><name><surname>Jassey</surname><given-names>Alagie</given-names></name><role specific-use="author">Author</role><aff><institution>University of Maryland, Baltimore</institution><addr-line><named-content content-type="city">Baltimore</named-content></addr-line><country>United States</country></aff></contrib><contrib contrib-type="author"><name><surname>Logue</surname><given-names>James</given-names></name><role specific-use="author">Author</role><aff><institution>University of Maryland, Baltimore</institution><addr-line><named-content content-type="city">Baltimore</named-content></addr-line><country>United States</country></aff></contrib><contrib contrib-type="author"><name><surname>Weston</surname><given-names>Stuart</given-names></name><role specific-use="author">Author</role><aff><institution>University of Maryland, Baltimore</institution><addr-line><named-content content-type="city">Baltimore</named-content></addr-line><country>United States</country></aff></contrib><contrib contrib-type="author"><name><surname>Wagner</surname><given-names>Michael A</given-names></name><role specific-use="author">Author</role><aff><institution>University of Maryland, Baltimore</institution><addr-line><named-content content-type="city">Baltimore</named-content></addr-line><country>United States</country></aff></contrib><contrib contrib-type="author"><name><surname>Galitska</surname><given-names>Ganna</given-names></name><role specific-use="author">Author</role><aff><institution>University of Maryland, Baltimore</institution><addr-line><named-content content-type="city">Baltimore</named-content></addr-line><country>United States</country></aff></contrib><contrib contrib-type="author"><name><surname>Miller</surname><given-names>Katelyn</given-names></name><role specific-use="author">Author</role><aff><institution>University of Maryland, Baltimore</institution><addr-line><named-content content-type="city">Baltimore</named-content></addr-line><country>United States</country></aff></contrib><contrib contrib-type="author"><name><surname>Frieman</surname><given-names>Matthew</given-names></name><role specific-use="author">Author</role><aff><institution>University of Maryland</institution><addr-line><named-content content-type="city">Baltimore</named-content></addr-line><country>United States</country></aff></contrib><contrib contrib-type="author"><name><surname>Jackson</surname><given-names>William T</given-names></name><role specific-use="author">Author</role><aff><institution>University of Maryland, Baltimore</institution><addr-line><named-content content-type="city">Baltimore</named-content></addr-line><country>United States</country></aff></contrib></contrib-group></front-stub><body><p>The following is the authors’ response to the original reviews.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p><bold>Reviewer #1 (Public Review):</bold></p><p>The enteroviruses comprise a medically important genus in the large and diverse picornavirus family, and are known to be released without lysis from infected cells in large vesicles containing numerous RNA genome-containing capsids - a feature allowing for en bloc transmission of multiple viral genomes to newly infected cells that engulf these vesicles. SIRT-1 is an NAD-dependent protein deacetylase that has numerous and wide ranging effects on cellular physiology and homeostasis, and it is known to be engaged in cellular responses to stress and autophagy.</p><p>Jassey et al. show that RNAi depletion of SIRT-1 impairs the release of enterovirus D-68 (EVD68) in EVs recovered from the supernatant fluids of infected cells using a commercial exosome isolation kit. The many functions attributed to SIRT-1 in the literature reflect its capacity to deacetylate various cell proteins engaged in transcription, DNA repair, and regulation of metabolism, apoptosis and autophagy. However, Jassey et al. make the surprising claim that the proviral role of SIRT-1 in promoting enterovirus release is not dependent on its deacetylase activity. Fig. S1C is crucial to this suggestion, as it is said to show that reconstituting expression with a catalytically-inactive mutant can rescue virus release from SIRT-1 depleted cells. However, no information is provided concerning the levels of endogenous and ectopicallyexpressed SIRT-1 proteins in this experiment, making it very difficult to interpret the results. Is the mutant SIRT-1 protein expressed at a higher level than the non-mutant protein? Is there a 'sponging' effect with these transfections that lessens the siRNA efficiency and reduces knockdown of the endogenous protein? Fig. S1B and Fig. 4C convincingly show that EX527, a small molecule inhibitor of the deacetylase activity of SIRT-1, inhibits extracellular release of the virus. This suggests that the deacetylase activity of SIRT-1 is in fact required for the proviral effect of SIRT-1. This is a fundamentally important question that will require more investigation.</p></disp-quote><p>We have included western blot data (Fig. S1D), which shows comparable levels of expression between the wild-type and mutant SIRT-1 constructs as well as the endogenous SIRT-1. While both constructs partially rescued EV-D68 titers in SIRT-1 knockdown cells, only the wild-type construct rescued SERCA2A protein levels, indicating that SIRT-1 deacetylase activity is required for SERCA2A expression but not for EV-D68 infection.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Fig. 6 shows how SIRT-I knockdown impacts the release of enterovirus D68 in EVs recovered from cell culture supernatant using a commercial 'Total Exosome Isolation Kit'. The authors should describe the principle this kit exploits to isolate 'exosomes' (affinity isolation?) and specify which antibodies it involves (anti-phosphatidylserine, anti-CD63, others?) This could impact the outcome of these experiments, and moreover is important to include in the longterm scientific record. The authors are appropriately cautious in describing the vesicles they presume to be isolated by the kit as simply 'extracellular vesicles', since there are multiple types of EVs with very different mechanisms of biogenesis, of which 'exosomes' are but one specific type. It would have been more elegant had the authors shown that SIRT-1 is required for EVD68 release in detergent-sensitive vesicles with low buoyant density in isopycnic gradients, and to characterize the size and number of viral capsids in these vesicles by electron microscopy.</p></disp-quote><p>We have added a description of the Total Exosome Isolation Kit principle to the materials and methods. The reagent, in brief, ties up water molecules and forces less soluble components, such as vesicles, out of the culture media, which can then be pelleted by centrifugation. The purity and size distribution of exosomes isolated with this kit is comparable to ultracentrifugation.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Fig. 6 shows that SIRT-1 depletion upregulates CD63 expression, but has no apparent impact on the release of CD63-positive 'EVs' from uninfected cells. EV-D68 infection also upregulates CD63 expression in SIRT-1 replete cells, and in this case, increases the release of CD63-positive EVs. The combination of infection and SIRT-1 depletion massively upregulates CD63 expression, but appears to eliminate the enhanced release of CD63-positive EVs resulting from infection alone. These are interesting results, from which the authors infer CD63 is associated with EVs containing EV-D68. But, do we know this? Can a CD63 pulldown immunoprecipitate EV-D68 capsid proteins or viral RNA? CD63 is strongly associated with exosomes released from cells through the multi-vesicular body pathway, which are distinct from the LC3-positive EVs released by secretory autophagy that have previously been associated with enteroviruses. The authors suggest that 'knockdown of SIRT-1 may prevent the exocytosis of CD63-positive EVs&quot;, but this is a very broad claim (and not really demonstrated by Fig. 6): it requires a clearer definition of what the authors mean by 'exocytosis' and a much more detailed analysis of the size and buoyant density of EVs released in a SIRT-1-dependent process.</p></disp-quote><p>We have toned down this suggestion, which sets up our logic for what is now Figure 7 but we agree does not prove the specific nature of these vesicles.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>The authors suggest that almost all EV-D68 released from infected cells is released without cell lysis in EVs. However, they generally show data from only a single time point following infection (5 or 6 hrs post-infection). It would have been interesting to see a more complete temporal analysis, and to know whether a high proportion of virus continues to be released in EVs, or if it is swamped out ultimately by lytic release of nonenveloped virus.</p></disp-quote><p>In these cells, very little virus is released at earlier timepoints, and after 6hpi it is difficult to analyze virus release because of cell detachment and lysis. In a future publication we will use less susceptible cells to analyze a time course of release.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Fig. 1D indicates that a small fraction of SIRT-1 leaks from the nucleus in EV-D68 infected cells. The authors suggest this is due to targeted nuclear export, rather than simply leaky nuclear pores which are well known to exist in enterovirus-infected cells. The authors present similar fluorescent microscopy data showing inhibition of TFEB export in leptomycin-B treated cells in Fig. S2A in support of their claim that this is specific SIRT-1 export, but these data are far from convincing - there is equivalent residual TFEB and SIRT-1 in the cytoplasm of the treated cells.Quantitative immunoblots of cytoplasmic and nuclear cell fractions might prove more compelling.</p></disp-quote><p>We have changed the text to remove the word “block” and instead suggest that there is inhibition, given the difference we observe with and without leptomycin-B.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Finally, the authors should be more specific in describing the viruses they have studied (EV-D68 and PV). It would be preferable to describe these as 'enteroviruses' (including in the title of the manuscript), rather than more broadly as 'picornaviruses'. There is no certainty that the requirement for SIRT-1 in non-lytic release of virus extends to hepatoviruses or other picornaviral genera, for which mechanisms of nonlytic release may be quite different.</p></disp-quote><p>We have made this change and thank the reviewer for pointing this out.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p><bold>Reviewer #2 (Public Review):</bold></p><p>The authors aimed to connect SIRT-1 to EV-D68 virus release through mediating ER stress. They are successful in robustly connecting these pathways experimentally and show a new role for SIRT-1 in EV-D68 infection. These results extend to additional viruses, suggesting role(s) for SIRT-1 in diverse virus infection.</p><p>The authors note that EV-D68 does not significantly impact SIRT-1 protein levels (Fig 1E and F), though this has been described for other picornaviruses (Xander et al., J Immunol 2019; Han et al., J Cell Sci 2016; Kanda et al Biochem Biophys Res Commun 2015). This may be of interest to note in the manuscript.</p></disp-quote><p>We have cited the above papers in the manuscript and thank the reviewer for these suggestions.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>The data regarding CVB3 (Fig S4) are especially interesting because they show no discernable impact on infection. The manuscript should describe this further and perhaps speculate on potential reasons. Could it be due to inefficient knockdown?</p></disp-quote><p>We have shown that both genetic and pharmacological inhibition of SIRT-1 does not significantly alter CVB3 titers. We do not think this is due to inefficient knockdown since the CVB3 and PV experiments were done concurrently. We are currently investigating why CVB3 responds differently from EV-D68 and PV.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>SIRT-1 (and other sirtuins) have been linked to an innate interferon response. Are any of the phenotypes observed here due to IFN responses? The use of H1HeLa cells would suggest this is not the case.</p></disp-quote><p>We think this is unlikely because H1HeLas are not IFN-competent and the knockdown of SIRT1 did not significantly alter viral RNA replication</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p><bold>Reviewer #1 (Recommendations For The Authors):</bold></p><p>In Fig. 1, it would be informative to show an immunoblot of the protein in knockdown vs control cells (this is shown in different experiments in Fig. 2A and 3C, with variable degrees of knockdown efficiency, but ideally should be shown here also).</p></disp-quote><p>The knockdown efficiency of SIRT-1 is now shown in Fig. S1D. We thank the reviewer for this suggestion.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Why is the extracellular virus titer in the control cells in Fig. 1C so much lower (over a 1.5 logs) than in Fig. 1B? Has the plasmid transfection induced an innate immune response, and could this be confounding the experiment?</p></disp-quote><p>We think this is due to stress induced by transfection and not an innate immune response, since H1Hela are not interferon competent.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>SIRT-1 is recognized to have a regulatory role in autophagy, but the author's claim that it is&quot;essential for stress induced and basal autophagy&quot; would be strengthened by including in Fig.2B control images of starved and CCCP-treated cells.</p></disp-quote><p>LC3 lipidation and p62 degradation are the hallmarks of autophagy initiation and flux, which are shown in Fig. 2A. The goal of Fig. 2B was to verify the impact of SIRT-1 knockdown in restricting basal autophagic degradation. We will examine the effect of starvation and CCCP treatment in future studies. We thank the reviewer for understanding.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>The BiP immunoblot shown in Fig. 4B does not support the claim that 'TG [thapsigargin] treatment induced BiP protein levels' whereas 'EV-D68 infection reduced BiP levels...suggesting that EV-D68 blocks ER stress.' The apparent differences in BiP expression are minimal and of questionable biological significance.</p></disp-quote><p>We have consistently observed a reduction in BiP levels during EV-D68 infection in both hSABCi-NS1.1 as indicated in Fig. 4B and H1HeLa (see Author response image 1), which is consistent with an ER stress blockade during EV-D68 infection.</p><fig id="sa2fig1" position="float"><label>Author response image 1.</label><graphic mimetype="image" mime-subtype="tiff" xlink:href="elife-87993-sa2-fig1-v1.tif"/></fig><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Minor comments:</p><p>1. The variable and wide-ranging scale of the y-axis in Figs. 1A-C and S1 is distracting, exaggerates small differences, and makes it difficult to assess the magnitude of differences in virus titers. The scale should be standardized and held constant in graphs showing results from similar types of experiments.</p></disp-quote><p>Our graphs are plotted based on the viral titers from experiments, mostly done on different days. We are confident that the variabilities in the y-axis do not affect the statistical analyses.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>1.

The data in Figure S5 suggests that most, but not all cells, are infected, so having this control seems important for their IFA experiments.</p></disp-quote><p>SIRT-1 dsRNA staining for EV-D68 infection is shown in Fig. S5A and all cells appear to be infected.

The authors show that knockdown reduces CD63 levels in purified EVs, but this could be explained if exosomes are not generated as robustly with SIRT-1 knockdown.</p></disp-quote><p>We don’t want to use the word “exosomes” since their definition is very specific, and only use it once in our manuscript, to describe known membrane associations of CD63. We do not think SIRT-1 knockdown affects the intracellular generation of EVs, since depleting SIRT-1 leads to the buildup of CD63 positive signals in the whole cell lysates compared to the scramble control (Fig. 7B and C). Instead, our data suggest that SIRT-1 regulates the release of EVs during EV-D68 infection.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Labels of graphs for &quot;Infection&quot; versus treatment (&quot;TG&quot; or &quot;EX527&quot;) is unclear. All samples are presumably infected, so perhaps the authors meant to label these diagrams as untreated.</p></disp-quote><p>We have made the changes in the labels and thank the reviewer for helping make these graphs more clear.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>The induction of ER stress with TG and repression of stress with EV-D68 infection is clear from BiP western blots. Are BiP levels reduced in SIRT-1 knockdown cells? Their data with TG treatment and knockdown suggests this may be possible.</p></disp-quote><p>We have not examined the impact of SIRT-1 knockdown on BiP protein levels. But since SIRT1 KD increases ER stress, as evidenced by a reduction in SERCA2A levels (Fig. 3C and E), we would expect an increase in BiP levels in SIRT-1 depleted cells.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Would the authors expect TG to reduce EVs with EV-D68 as well? Presumably, combination of TG with SIRT-1 would reduce EVs similar to the results shown in Figure 6C. They mention in the discussion that TG and SIRT-1 &quot;share common cellular targets&quot; so it would be interesting to determine if TG acts similar to SIRT-1 knockdown with regard to EVs.</p></disp-quote><p>We think TG will similarly reduce EVs in EV-D68-infected cells, and we are currently testing this hypothesis.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Because of the inclusion of the SARS-CoV-2 data and mention in the abstract, it may be appropriate to include that data (Fig S7) in the main figures. The authors mention SIRT-1 as important to MERS-CoV infection in the introduction, but SIRT-1 has been implicated in RNA virus infection, including picornaviruses (noted above). The expansion of this section to provide additional context would benefit the introduction and discussion.</p></disp-quote><p>We have moved the former Fig. S7 to the main manuscript as Fig. 6.</p></body></sub-article></article>
