Here, we examined the changes in the landscape of transcription start sites and alternative promoter (AP) usage and their impact on the translatome in TCL1-driven chronic lymphocytic leukemia (CLL). Our findings revealed a marked elevation of APs in CLL B cells from Eµ-Tcl1 transgenic mice, which are particularly enriched with intra-genic promoters that generate N-terminally truncated or modified proteins. Intra-genic promoter activation is mediated by (1) loss of function of ‘closed chromatin’ epigenetic regulators due to the generation of inactive N-terminally modified isoforms or reduced expression; (2) upregulation of transcription factors, including <italic>c-Myc</italic>, targeting the intra-genic promoters and their associated enhancers. Exogenous expression of <italic>Tcl1</italic> in MEFs is sufficient to induce intra-genic promoters of epigenetic regulators and promote <italic>c-Myc</italic> expression. We further found a dramatic translation downregulation of transcripts bearing CNY cap-proximal trinucleotides, reminiscent of cells undergoing metabolic stress.

CLL is characterized by an outgrowth of malignant CD5 positive B cells, mainly residing in the peripheral blood (PB), bone marrow, and lymphoid organs, and by a high biological heterogeneity reflected in clinically different outcomes including disease progression, therapy response, and relapse (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Kröber et al., 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib54">Zenz et al., 2010</xref>). The hallmark of the CLL disease is mainly decreased apoptosis resulting from overexpression of anti-apoptotic proteins and resistance to apoptosis in vivo. The <italic>Tcl1</italic> oncogene is highly expressed in CLL cells, and its expression level correlates with the CLL aggressiveness (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Herling et al., 2006</xref>). <italic>Tcl1</italic> was initially discovered as a gene involved in the rearrangement of the T-cell leukemia/lymphoma 1 locus at 14q32.1, the most common chromosomal aberrations detected in mature T-cell leukemias (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib48">Virgilio et al., 1994</xref>). The central role of TCL1 in CLL was demonstrated in transgenic mice overexpressing the human <italic>Tcl1</italic> gene under the control of the immunoglobulin promoter and enhancer (Eµ-Tcl1) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Bichi et al., 2002</xref>). These mice develop normally into adulthood but develop CLL that is highly similar to the human disease and is characterized by CD5+ cells, which accumulate in the spleens, livers, and lymph nodes.</p><p>The association of high TCL1 expression and malignant transformation is linked to its involvement in several major oncogenic pathways, including the enhancement of AKT activity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Herling et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Noh et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Patil et al., 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">Pekarsky et al., 2010</xref>); interaction with the DNA repair ataxia–telangiectasia-mutated (ATM) factor (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Gaudio et al., 2012</xref>), and the transcription factor CREB (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">Pekarsky et al., 2008</xref>) as well as in contributing to accelerated tumorigenic and the prosurvival NF-κB signaling (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Gaudio et al., 2012</xref>). Inhibition of activator protein 1 (AP-1) transcriptional activity via interaction of TCL1 with the AP-1 complex represents another mechanism to antagonize the expression of pro-apoptotic factors (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Gaudio et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Motiwala et al., 2011</xref>). TCL1 was also shown to contribute to epigenetic reprogramming via interacting with the de novo DNA methyltransferase 3A (DNMT3A) and reducing its enzymatic activity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Palamarchuk et al., 2012</xref>). Considering the central role of TCL1 in tumor initiation, progression, and maintenance, it is reasonable that its oncogenic functions involve additional, yet to be discovered, activities.</p><p>The transcription initiation of a specific gene can occur from more than one position in the DNA, creating several mRNA isoforms. Alterations in transcription start site (TSS) selection and alternative promoter (AP) usage increase transcriptome diversity and regulation. For example, the level of transcription initiation can vary between different TSSs under different growth conditions, in response to a specific signal, or different cell types and tissues. In addition, mRNA isoforms with different 5′ leaders can vary in their translation efficiency (TE) or half-lives. Likewise, AP usage can lead to the generation of protein isoforms that differ in their N termini and as a result can have different or even opposite biological functions. Recent large-scale promoter analysis in hundreds of human and mouse primary cell types shed light on the prevalence of AP usage in mammals (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Forrest et al., 2014</xref>) as well as in multiple cancer types (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Demircioğlu et al., 2019</xref>). Several studies have examined the translation and stability of transcript isoforms of the same gene and the contribution of AP usage to the translational response to stress (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Floor and Doudna, 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Arribere and Gilbert, 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib49">Wang et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib43">Tamarkin-Ben-Harush et al., 2017</xref>). However, presently little is known about the impact of TSSs and AP usage changes on the protein content of cells undergoing cancer progression. Considering that even transient cellular stress is associated with dramatic changes in the landscape of TSSs and AP usage that are coordinated with translation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib43">Tamarkin-Ben-Harush et al., 2017</xref>), it is reasonable to assume that such alterations can affect translatability in cells undergoing oncogenic transformation. Some of the new cancer-specific protein isoforms generated by AP usage can help maintain the transformed phenotype. Presently, the vast majority of studies measured global changes in mRNA abundance and transcript translatability in cancer cells, while the potential effect of variations in TSSs selection and AP usage on translation was hardly addressed.</p><p>This study examined the changes in TSS selection and AP usage and their impact on the translatome during malignant transformation of B cells by the <italic>Tcl1</italic> oncogene. Using healthy and Eµ-Tcl1 transgenic mice, we compared the TSSs landscape of normal and CLL B cells. Our findings revealed a marked elevation of APs in malignant CLL B cells with a particularly high prevalence of intra-genic promoters that are predicted to generate N-terminally truncated or N-terminally modified proteins. The induced cryptic promoters are driven by nearby enhancers and upregulation of their cognate transcription factors, including the <italic>c-Myc</italic> oncogene. A promoter shift in the opposite direction accounts for the induced expression of the immune checkpoint ligand PD-L2. Notably most of the intra-genic-generated transcripts are also efficiently translated. These remarkable changes of promoters and TSSs are linked to the loss of function of many ‘closed chromatin’ epigenetic regulators via induction of inactive isoforms by promoter shifts or by reduced expression, resulting in a feed-forward loop. The activation of intra-genic cryptic promoters and the <italic>c-Myc</italic> oncogene elevation are mediated, at least in part, by the <italic>Tcl1</italic> oncogene itself and are therefore intrinsic to the CLL B cells. We further found a dramatic and specific translation downregulation of transcripts bearing CNY cap-proximal trinucleotides, reminiscent of cells undergoing energy stress. These findings explored the contribution of 5′ end mRNA isoforms and their associated translational changes during cellular transformation and uncovered novel <italic>Tcl1</italic> oncogenic pathways.</p></sec><sec id="s2" sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><sec id="s2-1"><title>Global analysis of TSSs revealed extensive induction of promoter shifts in CLL B cells</title><p>To address the potential contribution of AP to CLL we used the Eµ-Tcl1 transgenic mice overexpressing the human <italic>Tcl1</italic> gene under the control of the immunoglobulin heavy chain (IgH) variable region promoter (V<sub>H</sub>) and immunoglobulin heavy chain enhancer (Eµ-Tcl1) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Bichi et al., 2002</xref>). Like the human CLL, Eµ-Tcl1 mice accumulate transformed CD5+ B cells in the spleens, livers, and lymph nodes during adulthood, reproducing CLL (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">Pekarsky et al., 2008</xref>). Splenocytes from healthy and Eµ-Tcl1 mice were subjected to affinity-based capture using CD19 magnetic beads to isolate B cells and CLL B cells, respectively. Total RNA was extracted and subjected to Cap Analysis of Gene Expression (CAGE) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Carninci et al., 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib42">Takahashi et al., 2012</xref>) library preparation and Illumina deep sequencing of the first 27 nucleotides CAGE tags from the 5′ ends (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1A</xref>). An average of 10.625 million CAGE tags per sample was aligned to a total of 2.67 million CAGE-derived TSSs (CTSSs) that were mapped and clustered to a consensus set of 28,616 promoters that correspond to a total of 11,515 genes. Using this high-throughput data from two independent biological replicates, we determined the global landscape of TSSs and their relative abundance in healthy and CLL B cells. Metagene analysis of both WT and Eµ-Tcl1 CAGE data showed almost perfect alignment to the annotated TSS atlas of the FANTOM5 project (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Lizio et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1B</xref>), indicating the proper calculation of the TSS positions at a single-base resolution. The CAGE libraries were assessed with coefficient scores calculated using the Pearson pairwise-correlation test and the reproducibility of the replicates were found to be high (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1A</xref>). As expected, in both WT and Eµ-Tcl1 samples, most of the TSSs with the highest expression level were mapped to the core promoter region (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1C</xref>). A significant fraction of the TSSs was found within introns and intergenic regions. Since the CAGE method captures all capped RNAs, these data also detect enhancer RNAs (eRNAs), a class of short noncoding RNAs resulting from a balanced bidirectional transcription from enhancers that are unstable and nonpolyadenylated (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Andersson et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Kim et al., 2010</xref>) (examples of an enhancer and super-enhancer are shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1A, C</xref>). We examined the possibility that part of the intronic and intra-genic CAGE reads are derived from active eRNAs. Based on the criteria of balanced bidirectional read mapping, we calculated the frequencies of eRNAs in introns and intergenic regions and found that most of the intronic TSSs (85% in Eµ-Tcl1 and 79% in WT) and a significant fraction of the intra-genic TSSs (62% in Eµ-Tcl1 and 50% in WT) are indeed derived from eRNAs (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1C</xref>). The ability of CAGE to detect lowly expressed genes makes it crucial to reduce the mean–variance relationship of count data prior to differential expression (DE) analysis. A ‘blind’ analysis of the variance stabilizing transformation was performed and summarized by a principle component analysis (PCA). PCA1 explained 85% of the variance and distinguished between WT and Eµ-Tcl1, where WT samples are tightly clustered and Eµ-Tcl1 are separated by 13% of the variance, which is explained by PCA2 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1D</xref>). As no systemic effect on samples was found, we decided to fit a DE model without using a correction factor. Out of the 28,616 consensus TSSs, we found in Eµ-Tcl1 3337 upregulated and 1829 downregulated TSSs (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1D</xref>), suggesting an overall upregulation of many promoters in CLL. To test the contribution of eRNA to the differentially expressed TSSs in Eµ-Tcl1, we used an established method to predict eRNA–TSS interactions based on genomic distance and expression-based correlation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Andersson and Sandelin, 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib46">Thodberg and Sandelin, 2019</xref>). We found 255 upregulated eRNAs, of them 106 were positively correlated to the 203 upregulated TSSs, while out of 179 downregulated eRNAs, 86 were positively correlated to the 331 downregulated TSSs (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1D</xref>). Lengths of the TSS clusters were calculated by the interquartile range (IQR) of highly expressed (&gt;10 tag per million [TPM]) TSSs. TSS clusters lengths holding 10–90% of pooled TSSs expression were found to distribute into sharp and broad promoters bimodally (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1E</xref>). Consistent with known promoter architecture (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Carninci et al., 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib41">Suzuki et al., 2001</xref>), general TSSs are characterized by YR at the (−1) and (+1) positions (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1E</xref>). Promoters with broad TSS distributions tend to be surrounded by CpG islands, while promoters with sharp TSSs are defined by the presence of a TATA box around position −30 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1F</xref>).

To determine differential TSS usage (DTU), we examined the multipromoter subset and found 550 significant DTUs from 489 genes where the alternative TSS is upregulated in Eµ-Tcl1 and 373 DTUs from 328 genes with downregulated alternative TSS. The 47% more cases of upregulated alternative TSS indicate that DTU during CLL transformation is gaining more new isoforms than losing the canonical ones (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2C</xref>). The Eµ-Tcl1 upregulated alternative TSSs were enriched at the core promoter, 5′ UTR, CDS, and intron regions but not at distal regions (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2C</xref>).

Out of 543 DTUs found within the 5′ UTR, 142 were also differentially translated, of which 76 and 66 were transcriptionally up- and downregulated, respectively. Intriguingly, the vast majority of the transcriptionally upregulated DTU (60/76) are classified as High-TE, and most of the downregulated DTUs are classified as Low-TE (41/66) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5C</xref>), indicating for coordination of TSS selection with mRNA translation.</p><p>To assess the potential functional consequences of the intra-genic alternative TSSs, predicted to generate N-terminally truncated/modified protein isoforms, we calculated the ratio of CAGE tags between the intra-genic alternative TSS and the canonical TSS only from the polysomes fraction (translated transcripts). When the count of intra-genic alternative TSS in the polysome fraction exceed 50% of the canonical TSS, we consider this intra-genic alternative TSS to substantially affect the function of the canonical full-length protein. In total, we found 73 intra-genic alternative TSS that are upregulated in Eµ-Tcl1 and exceeding 50% of the canonical TSS and 168 intra-genic alternative TSS which their lower translatability will less likely to impact protein functionality (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5D</xref>). GO analysis of these 73 genes is summarized in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5E</xref> by plotting the level of promoter shifting (scored as inclusive log FC, bar height) and the translation level of an intra-genic alternative TSSs relative to the canonical TSSs, which provides insight into the potential vulnerability of their cellular activity. Genes have been clustered into the following cellular processes: ‘apoptotic process’, ‘cell adhesion’, ‘chromatin regulation’, ‘DNA/RNA synthesis’, ‘generation of precursor metabolites and energy’, ‘ion channel’, ‘MAPK signaling’, ‘protein metabolism’, ‘signal transduction’, and ‘vesicle-mediated transport’. Interestingly, under ‘chromatin regulation’, we could find Eµ-Tcl1-specific truncated isoforms of chromatin remodelers and epigenetic players that might be involved in the aberrant TSS utilization found in Eµ-Tcl1 B cells. This class includes histone modifiers: <italic>Smyd4</italic>, <italic>Sirt2</italic>, <italic>Sirt4</italic>, <italic>Hdac4</italic>, <italic>Hdac5</italic>, <italic>Kdm4a</italic>, <italic>Zcwpw1</italic>, and <italic>Wiz</italic>; DNA methylation factors: <italic>Dnmt3a</italic> and <italic>Mgmt</italic> and chromatin remodeling factors: <italic>Chd1</italic>, <italic>Smarca5</italic>, and <italic>Bcl7b</italic>. In addition, under ‘DNA/RNA synthesis’ GO, we could find Eµ-Tcl1-specific truncated isoforms of DNA repair genes such as <italic>Xrcc1</italic>, <italic>Recql5</italic>, and <italic>Tep1</italic>, and direct transcription regulators essential for hematopoiesis that includes <italic>Gfi1</italic>, <italic>Zbtb20</italic>, <italic>Ago3</italic>, <italic>Ssbp4</italic>, <italic>Ddx54</italic>, and <italic>Arntl</italic> (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5E</xref>). These cases of promoter shifting in Eµ-Tcl1 leads to the generation of highly translated protein isoforms with possible loss of function or dominate-negative activities. For example, Eµ-Tcl1-specific cryptic transcription (2.22 log FC) within the fourth intron of <italic>Dnmt3a</italic> leads to the loss of three exons (211 amino acids) that constitute its DNA-binding domain (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5F</xref>), which is important to the DNA methylation activity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib40">Suetake et al., 2011</xref>) and is generally associated with closed chromatin state (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Brocks et al., 2017</xref>). The <italic>Dnmt3a</italic> cryptic TSS is enriched within Polysomes fractions, suggesting that <italic>Dnmt3a</italic> activity is substantially impaired (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5F</xref>, left). A promoter shifting in Sirtuin 2 (<italic>Sirt2</italic>, 3.32 log FC), a type III histone deacetylase (<italic>Hdac</italic>), interrupts the deacetylase domain positioned between residues 65 and 340 that generates a truncated isoform with higher translatability compared to the canonical isoform which is enriched in the polysomes fraction (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5F</xref>. middle). Together with HDACs, lysin demethylase (KDMs), erasers of histone three lysin-9 and lysin-36 methylation marks of active transcription are known to be corecruited to ensure gene silencing (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Mozzetta et al., 2015</xref>). DTU found in lysine-specific demethylase 4a (<italic>Kdm4a</italic>) has an Eµ-Tcl1-specific cryptic transcription leading to a truncated isoform that is equally presented in polysome fractions as the canonical full-length isoform (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5F</xref>, right). Thus, with five truncated members of the HDAC and KDM families (<italic>Hdac4</italic>, <italic>Hdac5</italic>, <italic>Sirt2</italic> and <italic>Sirt4</italic>, <italic>Kdm4a</italic>) and dramatic downregulation of <italic>Hdac11</italic> and <italic>Hdac9</italic> (−13.79 and −4.59 log FC, respectively, <xref ref-type="table" rid="table1">Table 1</xref>), it appears that Eµ-Tcl1 B cells are characterized by reduced eraser activities of histone acetylation and methylation, to maintain open chromatin state.</p></sec><sec id="s2-5"><title>Identification of CNY initiating trinucleotides as translation inhibitory motif associated with metabolic stress signature</title><p>The polysome-CAGE data enable the determination of the exact first nucleotide of every transcript and its impact on TE. We first determined the frequencies of TSS nucleotides in our Eµ-Tcl1 data and found that the frequency of A and G (47% and 36%, respectively) is higher than the C and T (9% and 4%, respectively), as expected (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6A</xref>). Yet, the difference between purines to pyrimidines is substantially more significant. For example, in Eµ-Tcl1, purines account for 83%, but in MEFs, only 64% (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib43">Tamarkin-Ben-Harush et al., 2017</xref>), suggesting an increased preference of purines as start sites in B CLL cells. We next determined the TE of transcripts with different initiating nucleotides and observed that those initiated with a ‘C’ have a substantially lower TE compared to the A, G, and T (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6B</xref>). To examine whether the lower TE associated with the cap-proximal C is linked to the well-known TOP element (CYYYY), we analyzed the TE of the first trinucleotides and found that almost all C initiating trinucleotides have a relatively lower TE, including inhibitory trinucleotides that are part of the TOP element such as CCT and CTT, but also others that deviate from the TOP such as CAC, CAT, and CTG. Interestingly, among the C-initiating triplets, those with a pyrimidine (CNY) in the third position are associated with a much lower TE (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6C</xref>). Importantly, the nucleotides that follow the CNY do not seem to contribute to the TE suppression (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6D</xref>), indicating that the CNY context is the predominant feature. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6E</xref> presents three examples of TSSs adjacent to each other within the same promoter region that display differential Polysome to Free ratio.

By comparing the TSSs landscape of normal and CLL B cells, our findings revealed a dramatic induction of APs in malignant CLL B cells with a particularly high prevalence of intra-genic promoters predicted to generate N-terminally truncated or N-terminally modified proteins. Importantly, a major class of intra-genic APs activated in the Eµ-Tcl1 CLL cells is the ‘closed chromatin’ epigenetic regulators gene subset, predicted to generate a loss of function or dominant-negative isoforms. Enhanced chromatin accessibility due to downregulation of epigenetic gatekeepers is well known to promote transcription initiation from intra-genic cryptic promoters sites (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Brocks et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib50">Wei et al., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Mozzetta et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Hennig and Fischer, 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib51">Wei et al., 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Hennig et al., 2012</xref>). Thus, intra-genic promoter shifts in B CLL follow a feed-forward loop, in which activation of N-terminally truncated closed chromatin modifiers further enhance the cryptic promoter activity. Additionally, the regulatory regions of the intra-genic-cryptic initiation sites (proximal promoters and the nearby enhancers) are targeted by the <italic>c-Myc</italic> oncogene and several transcription factors that are specifically upregulated in Eµ-Tcl1 B CLL. Thus, the combined loss of epigenetic regulators and the induced expression of a specific subset of transcription factors underlie the dramatic TSSs and AP usage changes in Eµ-Tcl1 B CLL. Notably, these dysregulated gene expression features are most likely intrinsic to the Eµ-Tcl1 B CLL, as exogenous expression hTCL1 in MEFs is sufficient to drive the induction of intra-genic promoter of epigenetic regulators and to upregulate <italic>c-Myc</italic>.</p><p>Our findings are consistent with a recent study that reported changes in promoter utilization in multiple cancer types (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Demircioğlu et al., 2019</xref>). As this study used RNA-seq data to infer promoter activities, these data are substantially less accurate for estimating intra-genic promoter activity especially when it is embedded within internal exons or introns. Thus, our CAGE data of healthy and malignant B cells provided further insights on intra-genic promoter activities, their impact on the translatome, and the mechanism underlying their activation.</p><p>A previous study described decreased methylation levels in Eµ-Tcl1 mice and in CLL patients and reported a strong interaction between TCL1 and de novo DNA methyl transferases DNMT3A and 3B along with inhibition of the enzymatic activity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Palamarchuk et al., 2012</xref>), suggesting for direct inhibition of de novo methylation during leukemogenesis. In addition, TCL1 promotes the activity of the Alpha Serine/Threonine-Protein Kinase (AKT) signaling which also reduces DNMT3A activity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Popkie et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib52">Yang et al., 2019</xref>). Thus, activation of the AKT by the constitutively overexpressed TCL1 is likely to further reduce DNMT3A activity. Our findings complement these observations by uncovering another mechanism of impairment of DNMT3A activity via activation of an internal promoter and generation of large amounts of truncated inactive protein (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5F</xref>, left). All these mechanisms are likely to inhibit DNMT3A and DNA methylation in these cells in an additive manner. Inhibition of DNMT3A together with HDACs is sufficient to deregulate chromatin and induce cryptic promoters within genomic regions that normally are silenced (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Brocks et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib50">Wei et al., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Mozzetta et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Hennig and Fischer, 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib51">Wei et al., 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Hennig et al., 2012</xref>). We therefore propose that downregulation of DNMT3A directly and indirectly by TCL1 is the initial trigger for the feed-forward loop that induces cryptic promoters in Eµ-Tcl1 CLL cells.</p><p>The use of polysome-CAGE enabled us to assess the potential contribution of the N-terminally truncated/modified protein isoforms derived from intra-genic promoters to the functionality of the intact protein. This analysis reveals substantial impairments in several regulatory and metabolic pathways, including chromatin regulation and energy metabolism, that are expected to contribute to the transformed phenotype. Remarkably, upon analysis of the relationship of the exact cap-proximal nucleotides and TE, we observed that all ‘C’ initiating transcripts display lower TE compared to the A, G, and T. Furthermore, among the ‘C’ initiated transcripts, those that start with CNY display even lower TE relative to the other Cs. The effect of the ‘C’ on the TE is nicely demonstrated in the examples in which adjacent nucleotides from the same promoter region display dramatic differences in polysome occupancy (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6E</xref>). In these instances, the 5′ UTR length and sequence are almost identical. Considering that translation downregulation of the well-known C-initiating TOP element is the hallmark of various metabolic stresses and mTOR inhibition (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Meyuhas and Kahan, 2015</xref>), and the previous observation of downregulation of all C-initiating nucleotides following energy stress (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib43">Tamarkin-Ben-Harush et al., 2017</xref>), we infer that the Eµ-Tcl1 cells display a clear metabolic stress signature. Furthermore, the reanalysis of the first trinucleotide context of the energy-starved MEFs also identified CNY as the most inhibitory signal and the resemblance of the Eµ-Tcl1 CLL to metabolically stressed cells. Thus, our findings expand the regulatory sequences that mediate the effect of stress on translation beyond the TOP element. Such differences in the TE of initiating nucleotides were linked to reduced eIF4E levels upon energy stress, as its cap-binding activity is influenced by the identity of the first nucleotide (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib43">Tamarkin-Ben-Harush et al., 2017</xref>).</p><p>Considering the profound effect of TCL1 on multiple major regulatory pathways (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5</xref>) and the tolerance of TCL1 expressing cells to the inactivation of these processes (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7</xref>), it is reasonable that the most effective way to treat these malignancies is to target the TCL1 itself instead of the affected pathways. While TCL1 inhibitors have not yet been discovered, identifying such compounds should be an important therapeutic direction against TCL1-driven malignancies. Notably, the discovery of highly translated N-terminally modified proteins forms the basis for the identification of new, CLL-specific antigens that can be utilized for specific targeting of the CLL cells. Combining inhibitors against TCL1 and immunotherapy could be a promising strategy against CLL.</p><p>In summary, the ability of <italic>Tcl1</italic> to promote activation of intra-genic cryptic promoters of epigenetic regulators results in a feed-forward loop in which the loss of function of ‘closed chromatin’ inducers, by expression of N-terminally truncated isoforms, further enhance the activities of the cryptic promoter.

The utilization of the polysome-CAGE not only verified the expression of N-terminally modified protein isoforms but also uncovered the restricted protein synthesis capability of Eµ-Tcl1 B CLL as a point of vulnerability that can be exploited as a drug target. Our findings form the basis for future work on approaches to interfere in tumorigenic processes mediated by TCL1 in TCL1-overexpressing leukemias.</p></sec><sec id="s4" sec-type="materials|methods"><title>Materials and methods</title><sec id="s4-1"><title>Mice</title><p>C57BL/6wt were purchased from Harlan Biotech Israel (Rehovot, Israel).

DTU analysis was performed using the edgeR diffSpliceDGE method on the gene subset holding more than TSSs corresponding to more than 10% of total gene expression.</p></sec><sec id="s4-9"><title>Motif-based sequence analysis for TF-binding sites</title><p>In order to know what transcription factors might be involved in the regulation of alternative TSSs, we downloaded DNA-binding motifs as position frequency matrices (PFMs) from the core collection of JASPAR database (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Fornes et al., 2020</xref>) and matched it against promoter regions defined as −1000 bp and +100 to the peaks of CAGE TCs of TSSs and enhancers. We used TFBSTools (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib44">Tan and Lenhard, 2016</xref>) and motifmatcher (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">Schep, 2022</xref>) packages of the Bioconductor project, to obtain and find matches of motifs PFMs in promoter sequences, respectively. Using Fisher’s exact test, we have been able to see if a motif significantly co-occurs in upregulated alternative TSS and enhancers.</p></sec><sec id="s4-10"><title>5′ RACE</title><p>For the 5′ RACE we used the template switching RT enzyme mix (NEB), which make use of the Template Switching Oligo (TSO) with known sequence followed by three RNA Guanidines. Using gene-specific RT primers (listed in <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="supp4">Supplementary file 4</xref>), the reverse transcriptase reaches to the 5′ ends of the RNA template and switches to the TSO template by extending few nontemplated nucleotides on the cDNA 5′ end which then anneal to the rGrGrG sequence of the TSO to generate cDNA of 5′ leader sequences of all targeted genes. Based on 5′ RACE cDNA templates, we designed qPCR primers specifically targeting the 5′ UTRs of the truncated isoforms of all targeted genes.</p></sec><sec id="s4-11"><title>Eµ-Tcl1 adoptive transfer model</title><p>Generation of this mouse model was performed as previously described (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Hofbauer et al., 2011</xref>). Briefly, Eµ-Tcl1 mice approximately 12 months of age, with a malignant cell population higher than 60% in the PB were sacrificed. Their spleens were excised, and 4 × 10<sup>7</sup> cells resuspended in PBS−/− were injected into the tail vein of 6- to 8-week-old WT recipient mice. Progression of the disease was followed in the PB by using flow cytometry for the IgM/CD5 population. Mice with &gt;30% IgM+/CD5+ cells were considered to be diseased and were used for further analysis.</p></sec><sec id="s4-12"><title>Inhibitor assay</title><p>The survival of CLL B cells and healthy B cells was tested under the inhibitory effect of drugs targeting the activity of HDAC type II (TMP269, Cayman cat. 17738), HDAC type III (Thiomyristoyl, Cayman cat. 19398), KDM4A (NSC636819, Sigma-Aldrich, cat. 531996), and DNMT3A (Decitabine, MCE cat. HY-A0004). B cells isolated from Eµ-Tcl1 adoptive transfer and WT mice as described above. Triplicates of 2 million cells (per well) distributed in a 24-well tissue-culture plate treated with a serial four incremented concentrations of the above inhibitors (in DMSO). Following 48 hr, cells were washed with cold PBS, and resuspended in Annexin V Binding Buffer (BioLegend) at a concentration of 0.25–1.0 × 10<sup>7</sup> cells/ml. FITC Annexin V (BDPharmingen cat. 556419) was added to the samples with anti-CD19 and anti-CD5 for 20 min in the dark on ice. Cells were washed twice with Annexin V Binding Buffer (centrifuge 1400 rpm for 5 min, discard the supernatant), then resuspended in 300 µl of Annexin V Binding Buffer with 7-AAD (BDparmingen cat. 88,981E) Viability Staining Solution.

Finally, the authors provide evidence that TCL1 drives translational reprogramming akin to that observed under metabolic stress. Notwithstanding technical limitations that obscured direct detection of N-terminally truncated protein variants, it was found that this study is of broad potential interest inasmuch as it provides previously unappreciated evidence that TCL1 orchestrates epigenetic, transcriptional, and translational rewiring in leukemic cells. Based on this, the study by Ogran et al. should be of significant interest across a number of biomedical research disciplines ranging from regulation of gene expression to cancer research.</p></body></sub-article><sub-article article-type="decision-letter" id="sa1"><front-stub><article-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.77714.sa1</article-id><title-group><article-title>Decision letter</article-title></title-group><contrib-group content-type="section"><contrib contrib-type="editor"><name><surname>Topisirovic</surname><given-names>Ivan</given-names></name><role>Reviewing Editor</role><aff><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="ror">https://ror.org/056jjra10</institution-id><institution>Jewish General Hospital</institution></institution-wrap><country>Canada</country></aff></contrib></contrib-group><contrib-group><contrib contrib-type="reviewer"><name><surname>Topisirovic</surname><given-names>Ivan</given-names></name><role>Reviewer</role><aff><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="ror">https://ror.org/056jjra10</institution-id><institution>Jewish General Hospital</institution></institution-wrap><country>Canada</country></aff></contrib></contrib-group></front-stub><body><boxed-text id="sa2-box1"><p>Our editorial process produces two outputs: (i) <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://sciety.org/articles/activity/10.1101/2022.02.15.480558">public reviews</ext-link> designed to be posted alongside <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://www.biorxiv.org/content/10.1101/2022.02.15.480558v1">the preprint</ext-link> for the benefit of readers; (ii) feedback on the manuscript for the authors, including requests for revisions, shown below.

Your article has been reviewed by 3 peer reviewers, including Ivan Topisirovic as the Reviewing Editors and Reviewer #1, and the evaluation has been overseen by Kevin Struhl as the Senior Editor.</p><p>The reviewers have discussed their reviews with one another, and the Reviewing Editor has drafted this to help you prepare a revised submission.</p><p>Essential revisions:</p><p>1) It was found that the evidence of expression of putative N-terminally truncated proteins is required to fully support the proposed model. Notwithstanding that the overarching characterization of N-terminally truncated proteins across the proteome may be out of the scope of the paper, it was thought that the authors should at least provide evidence of in-depth-discussed proteins (e.g., chromatin modifiers). Moreover, it was thought that orthogonal techniques (e.g., 5'RACE) should be used to confirm the results of CAGE studies.</p><p>2) Link between TCL1-dependent alterations in transcription site selection and/or promoter usage and chromatin remodelling was found to be largely correlative. Based on this, it was thought that the authors should provide more mechanistic data to support the role of apparent TCL1-dependent alterations in chromatin factors and perturbations in chromatin structure.</p><p>3) As outlined in the individual reviews, some important issues were observed pertinent to bioinformatic analyses. It was also thought that several important controls were missing. For instance, a more detailed rationale should be provided for cut-offs/thresholds used in bioinformatic approaches. The reproducibility of the results between the two CAGE replicates was also not clear. An apparent lack of application of unique molecular identifiers in the CAGE approach was also observed. In addition, concerns were raised regarding the application of log-ratios to calculate translational efficiency. Finally, there was a lack of loading controls in some of the Western blots.</p><p>4) In general, it was thought that the studies using epigenetic and translational inhibitors (targets of which were thought to be in some cases at least partially misattributed) do not show that the observed effects are TCL1-specific. Based on this, it was deemed that the authors should either provide additional data supporting the tenet that TCL1 allows adaptation to insults caused by pharmacological targeting of the epigenetic modifiers and/or translational apparatus or significantly temper claims in this section of their study.</p><p><italic>Reviewer #1 (Recommendations for the authors):</italic></p><p>- It was found that it would be crucial to test the expression of truncated proteins experimentally. It is understandable that it would be unreasonable to request this on a global scale, but these experiments should be carried out on a selected set of proteins that are mentioned in the study (e.g., chromatin remodelers, PD-L2, Chd1, fbxo5) to further support the author's model.</p><p>- Although the polysome-CAGE approach to establish engagement of different 5'UTR isoforms on polysomes was highly appreciated, it was thought that the stoichiometry of ORF-truncated/retained vs. corresponding full-length proteins should be established for at least the subset of affected genes.</p><p>- The cut-off of 50% for polysome engagement of a given 5'UTR isoform on corresponding protein function seems arbitrary. To this end, it was thought that the functional characterization of the proteins whose length may be affected by alternative promoter selections/transcription start site selection would be advantageous. The latter should provide some insights into the relevance of the alternative promoter usage/TSS selection to TCL1-driven phenotypes. This was thought to be important as is it remains unclear what is the contribution of proposed mechanisms to TCL1-driven phenotypes, whereby the prior evidence shows that TCL1 plays a rather pleiotropic function in CLL whereby it engages a number of oncogenic pathways. It is understandable that the full phenotypic characterization of the proposed model is likely to be out of the scope of this study, but the functional characterization of at least a few of the selected proteins appears to be warranted.</p><p>- In line with the comment above, the link between TCL1-dependent ORF-retention and/or truncation of chromatin remodelers and alterations in chromatin appears to be purely correlative. The authors should either provide mechanistic evidence for the causative relationship between these phenomena (e.g., by focusing on Dnmt3a) or tone down their claims pertinent for this part of the study.</p><p>- There is no evidence that the observed effects of the inhibitors (figure 7) are TCL1-specific (e.g., would the same effects be observed in TCL1-overexpressing MEFs?). These data are rather preliminary and insufficient to support the tenet regarding the adaptation of CLL B cells to epigenetic and translational reprogramming. Literature showing the potential effectiveness of targeting suggested pathways/factors in CLL (e.g., eIF4E) was also largely ignored. Moreover, the author referred to MNK1/2 inhibitor as eIF4E inhibitor, which was found to be inappropriate. This part of the study is significantly weaker than the rest, and the authors should consider either expanding it or substantially toning down their claims.</p><p>- Some issues were noted pertinent to data analysis. For instance, the calculation of translational efficiency using log ratios that were previously demonstrated to be confounded by potential spurious correlations (PMID: 21115840). Addressing these issues along with providing more details related to the analyses that were performed throughout the study seems to be required.</p><p><italic>Reviewer #2 (Recommendations for the authors):</italic></p><p>1.

Why would such one nucleotide differences have profound effects on polysome association? Could this be an artifact of library preparation or bioinformatic treatment of CAGE-Seq?

Notwithstanding that the overarching characterization of N-terminally truncated proteins across the proteome may be out of the scope of the paper, it was thought that the authors should at least provide evidence of in-depth-discussed proteins (e.g., chromatin modifiers). Moreover, it was thought that orthogonal techniques (e.g., 5'RACE) should be used to confirm the results of CAGE studies.</p></disp-quote><p>As suggested, we now performed 5’ RACE to validate the CAGE results by picking four chromatin modifiers and examining the upregulation of the alternative TSS in Eu-TCl1 mice. The 5’ RACE was done using template switching RT enzyme mix (NEB), Template Switching Oligo (TSO) and a gene-specific reverse primer common to the canonical full-length isoform and the N’ terminally truncated one. In order to compare the transcription level of the truncated isoform between Eu-Tcl1 and WT mice, isoform-specific primers were used in the qPCR assay. The results of the 5’RACE-qPCR authenticate our CAGE-seq results, showing upregulation of the isoforms originating by alternative TSS of the four selected DNMT3a, CHD1, KDM4A and SIRT2 (see Figure 3—figure supplement 1 in the revised manuscript).</p><p>Notably, we also confirmed that these isoforms are efficiently translated to proteins by combining CAGE with polysome profiling (Figure 5). Other proteomic approaches such as mass spectrometry (MS) and western blot for detecting the N-terminally truncated/modified proteins are less suitable. With the MS, the peptides derived from N-terminally truncated proteins are shared with the full-length protein. In western blot, there are several limitations that include the finding of high-quality antibodies directed against the C-terminus of the candidate proteins, the ability to distinguish between truncated and proteolytically cleaved protein, and the ability to predict the new translation initiation site accurately, the ORF and the size of the protein isoform. This is particularly challenging since, in most cases, the new promoters are located within an intron. Nevertheless, we performed multiple western blots by purchasing antibodies against the C-terminus of selected proteins, but we could not identify the truncated protein with high certainty.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>2) Link between TCL1-dependent alterations in transcription site selection and/or promoter usage and chromatin remodelling was found to be largely correlative. Based on this, it was thought that the authors should provide more mechanistic data to support the role of apparent TCL1-dependent alterations in chromatin factors and perturbations in chromatin structure.</p></disp-quote><p>By combining our data with data from the literature, a mechanism by which TCL<sup>-</sup>1 promotes the activation of cryptic promoters is emerging. We briefly referred to this mechanism in the discussion of the original manuscript. In the revised manuscript, we further expand it with more specific details. Specifically, a previous study reported decreased DNA methylation levels in Eµ-Tcl1 mice and CLL patients and demonstrated an interaction between TCL1 and the de novo DNA methyl transferases DNMT3A and 3B along with inhibition of their enzymatic activity (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://www.biorxiv.org/content/10.1101/2022.02.15.480558v1.full#ref-15">1</ext-link>), suggesting for direct inhibition of de novo methylation by TCL1 during leukemogenesis. In addition, it was reported that TCL1 promotes the Α Serine/Threonine-Protein Kinase (AKT) activity. As AKT signaling itself reduces Dnmt3a activity (2, 3), over-sensitization of the AKT by the constitutively overexpressed TCL1 is likely to reduce DNMT3A activity further. Our findings complement these observations by uncovering another mechanism of impairment of DNMT3A activity via activation of an internal promoter and generation of large amounts of truncated inactive protein (Figure 5F, left). All these mechanisms inhibit DNMT3A and DNA methylation in these cells in an additive manner. We, therefore, propose that downregulation of DNMT3A directly and indirectly by TCL1 is the initial trigger for the activation of cryptic promoters in Eµ-Tcl1 CLL cells, which is further augmented by the activation of cryptic promoters of other chromatin regulators in a feed-forward loop and by activation of c-myc (see more details in the discussion).</p><p>(1) Palamarchuk, A., Yan, P.S., Zanesi, N., Wang, L., Rodrigues, B., Murphy, M., Balatti, V., Bottoni, A., Nazaryan, N., Alder, H. et al.

It was also thought that several important controls were missing. For instance, a more detailed rationale should be provided for cut-offs/thresholds used in bioinformatic approaches.</p></disp-quote><p>As suggested, we now provide explicit reasonings for the bioinformatics cut-off/thresholds described in the method paragraph titled “CAGE tag clustering, quantification and analysis&lt;milestone-start /&gt;״&lt;milestone-end /&gt;. After counting CAGE reads into defined tag clusters (TC), we filtered out TCs with less than one tag per million (TPM) to remove very lowly expressed TC and obtain likely biological relevance. Where eRNA prediction is based on finding two balanced bidirectional (sense and antisense) TCs, we set the threshold of the Bhattacharyya coefficient (BC) to 0.95, where the value of 1 corresponds to perfectly balanced sites. In addition, when we measured the width of TCs of pooled CAGE tags, we used a 10-90% interquartile range (IQR) threshold to dampen the effect of possible straggler tags that can greatly extend the width of a TSS candidate without contributing much to expression. Deseq2-based results of differentially expressed TCs were independently filtered by setting the α argument to 0.05, which is the significance cutoff used for optimizing the independent filtering. For the analysis of differential TSS Usage (DTU) that was done by the diffSpliceDGE method of the edgeR package, we used a subset of genes with more than one TSS to analyze. By considering only TSS that correspond to more than 10% of total gene expression, we guarantee meaningful detection of promoter shifting events during CLL transformation.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>The reproducibility of the results between the two CAGE replicates was also not clear.</p></disp-quote><p>We have added coefficient scores of CAGE library replicates derived from the RNA samples of Eu-TCL1 and WT, as well as CAGE library replicates from the polysome profiles of Eu-TCL1.
