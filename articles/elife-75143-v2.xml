Yeast peroxisomes metabolize fatty acids (FA), and methylotrophic yeasts also metabolize methanol. NADH and acetyl-CoA, produced by these pathways enter mitochondria for ATP production and for anabolic reactions. During the metabolism of FA and/or methanol, the mitochondrial oxidative phosphorylation (OXPHOS) pathway accepts NADH for ATP production and maintains cellular redox balance. Remarkably, peroxisome proliferation in Pichia pastoris was abolished in NADH-shuttling- and OXPHOS mutants affecting complex I or III, or by the mitochondrial uncoupler, 2,4-dinitrophenol (DNP), indicating ATP depletion causes the phenotype. We show that mitochondrial OXPHOS deficiency inhibits expression of several peroxisomal proteins implicated in FA and methanol metabolism, as well as in peroxisome division and proliferation. These genes are regulated by the Snf1 complex (SNF1), a pathway generally activated by a high AMP/ATP ratio. In OXPHOS mutants, Snf1 is activated by phosphorylation, but Gal83, its interacting subunit, fails to translocate to the nucleus. Phenotypic defects in peroxisome proliferation observed in the OXPHOS mutants, and phenocopied by the Δgal83 mutant, were rescued by deletion of three transcriptional repressor genes (MIG1, MIG2, and NRG1) controlled by SNF1 signaling. Our results are interpreted in terms of a mechanism by which peroxisomal and mitochondrial proteins and/or metabolites influence redox and energy metabolism, while also influencing peroxisome biogenesis and proliferation, thereby exemplifying interorganellar communication and interplay involving peroxisomes, mitochondria, cytosol, and the nucleus. We discuss the physiological relevance of this work in the context of human OXPHOS deficiencies.</p></abstract><kwd-group kwd-group-type="author-keywords"><kwd>peroxisome proliferation</kwd><kwd>mitochondria</kwd><kwd>OXPHOS</kwd><kwd>SNF1</kwd><kwd>interorganelle communication</kwd><kwd>feedback loop</kwd></kwd-group><kwd-group kwd-group-type="research-organism"><title>Research organism</title><kwd>Other</kwd></kwd-group><funding-group><award-group id="fund1"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000062</institution-id><institution>National Institute of Diabetes and Digestive and Kidney Diseases</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>DK41737</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Subramani</surname><given-names>Suresh</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><funding-statement>The funders had no role in study design, data collection, and interpretation, or the decision to submit the work for publication.</funding-statement></funding-group><custom-meta-group><custom-meta specific-use="meta-only"><meta-name>Author impact statement</meta-name><meta-value>The emerging importance of interorganellar communication is demonstrated by documentation of a feedback loop wherein peroxisome-generated metabolites affect mitochondrial ATP production and peroxisomal functions via signaling pathways requiring transmission of signals also through the cytosol and the nucleus.</meta-value></custom-meta></custom-meta-group></article-meta></front><body><sec id="s1" sec-type="intro"><title>Introduction</title><p>Like other subcellular organelles, peroxisomes divide and segregate to endow daughter cells with peroxisomes. Cells stringently regulate organelle number, volume, size, and content in response to environmental signals. Regulation of these properties, together with organelle dynamics and homeostasis, allows cells to endure metabolic or environmental stress, cope with the needs of cell division or differentiation, remove excess or damaged organelles by turnover, correct imbalances in organelle segregation during cell division, or repopulate organelles with different enzymes upon switching to a new environment. The division of some organelles, such as the nucleus or the Golgi apparatus, is coupled to the cell cycle (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib84">Sütterlin et al., 2002</xref>). However, for others, such as mitochondria and chloroplasts, division is uncoupled from cell division (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib59">Osteryoung and Nunnari, 2003</xref>). Peroxisomes division can be coupled or uncoupled from cell division (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib47">Lingard et al., 2008</xref>). The decoupling of peroxisome division during the cell cycle and cell division is likely due to the ability of cells to also produce peroxisomes de novo (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Hettema and Motley, 2009</xref>).</p><p>In yeast and other eukaryotes, three major pathways control peroxisome number. First, in constitutively dividing cells, peroxisomes divide by fission of pre-existing peroxisomes, a process we refer to simply as peroxisome division (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Guo et al., 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib92">Veenhuis et al., 2003</xref>). This process regulates peroxisome number in a geometric manner. A second pathway is where peroxisomes are induced to create many new organelles exponentially, a process we call ‘peroxisome proliferation’. Finally, peroxisome number is also controlled by pexophagy, the selective degradation of peroxisome by autophagic processes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Farré and Subramani, 2016</xref>).</p><p>In yeasts, peroxisome division occurs both during constitutive growth and cell division. Peroxisome size and number are sensitive to peroxisomal metabolic pathways and the metabolites available (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Chang et al., 1999</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib63">Poll-The et al., 1988</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib82">Smith et al., 2000</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib102">Yan et al., 2005</xref>). Changes in peroxisome number and size can also be induced by peroxisome proliferation, which generally occurs when cells are shifted to nutrients whose metabolism requires peroxisomes and their enzymes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib92">Veenhuis et al., 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib45">Lazarow, 2003</xref>). Finally, peroxisomal contents can also vary depending on the growth media whose metabolism requires different peroxisomal enzymes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib92">Veenhuis et al., 2003</xref>).</p><p>Peroxisome division uses a machinery also required for mitochondrial fission (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib74">Schrader, 2006</xref>). In yeast, this machinery is comprised of the proteins Fis1, Mdv, and Caf4, as well as the dynamin-related GTPase, Dnm1 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib41">Kuravi et al., 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib56">Motley et al., 2008</xref>). The Pex11 family of proteins activates peroxisome division specifically (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Huber et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">Koch and Brocard, 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">Koch et al., 2010</xref>). These proteins are conserved in evolution (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib74">Schrader, 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Aung et al., 2010</xref>) and are responsible for diseases in humans and plants (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib88">Thoms and Gärtner, 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib97">Wang et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib101">Weng et al., 2013</xref>). In <italic>Saccharomyces cerevisiae</italic>, while Pex11 promotes the division of peroxisomes already present in the cell, Pex25 initiates remodeling at the peroxisomal membrane to allow proliferation and Pex27 counters this activity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Huber et al., 2012</xref>).</p><p>Our current understanding of the mechanisms by which environmental cues activate peroxisome proliferation is rather limited (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib102">Yan et al., 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Aung et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Gurvitz and Rottensteiner, 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib73">Scheckhuber, 2020</xref>). In <italic>S. cerevisiae</italic>, peroxisome proliferation coincides with the transcriptional regulation, by nonfermentable oleate, of SNF1 complex-mediated induction of several peroxisomal β-oxidation and peroxisome proliferation genes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Karpichev and Small, 1998</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib83">Smith et al., 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib68">Rottensteiner et al., 1996</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib69">Rottensteiner et al., 2003</xref>). The Snf1 protein – the ortholog of the mammalian AMP-activated protein kinase (AMPK) – is a heterotrimer of the Snf1 catalytic subunit, the Snf4 activation subunit (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">Jiang and Carlson, 1997</xref>), and one of three β subunits (Sip1, Sip2, and Gal83) that localize the SNF1 complex to different cellular compartments (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">Jiang and Carlson, 1997</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib104">Yang et al., 1994</xref>). Gal83 directs the SNF1 complex to the nucleus in a glucose-regulated manner and facilitates the physical interaction between SNF1 and nuclear transcription factors (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib93">Vincent et al., 2001</xref>). In yeast cells grown in the absence of glucose, Snf1 is active via phosphorylation within its activation loop at Thr210 (T210) primarily by Sak1, but also by Tos3 and Elm1 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Elbing et al., 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Hedbacker et al., 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Hong et al., 2003</xref>). The activated SNF1 complex inactivates the transcriptional repressors, Mig1 and Mig2 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib90">Vallier and Carlson, 1994</xref>), via their phosphorylation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib76">Serra-Cardona et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib89">Treitel et al., 1998</xref>) and export from the nucleus, thereby enabling activation by the transcriptional activator, Adr1 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib105">Young et al., 2003</xref>).</p><p>Two additional transcriptional activators, Oaf1 and Pip2, regulate genes in response to oleate induction conditions (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Gurvitz and Rottensteiner, 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib68">Rottensteiner et al., 1996</xref>). However, these transcription activators have not been described in <italic>P. pastoris</italic> (now reclassified as <italic>Komagataella phaffii</italic>) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib64">Prielhofer et al., 2015</xref>).</p><p>In contrast, the addition of glucose to cells (glucose repression) results in a reduction in ADP levels that causes the Glc7-Reg1 protein phosphatase to dephosphorylate T210 and thereby inactivate Snf1 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Chandrashekarappa et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib51">Ludin et al., 1998</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib54">Mayer et al., 2011</xref>).</p><p>Notably, this entire description of peroxisome induction and proliferation involves transactions of proteins and metabolites residing in three compartments – the cytosol, nucleus, and peroxisomes, with no direct involvement of mitochondria. Yet, it is clear that peroxisomes contact other subcellular compartments, including mitochondria (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Dakik and Titorenko, 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib53">Mattiazzi Ušaj et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib78">Shai et al., 2018</xref>). Furthermore, mutations in genes affecting peroxisome biogenesis also impair mitochondrial function and morphology (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Baumgart et al., 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib72">Salpietro et al., 2015</xref>), and the reverse is also true (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Fransen et al., 2017</xref>).</p><p>We probed more deeply into the regulation of peroxisome content and proliferation in <italic>P. pastoris</italic>. During growth in glucose, most <italic>P. pastoris</italic> cells possess a few, small peroxisomes, with a limited lumenal content, but when cells are grown in oleate, numerous, small peroxisomes proliferate and are distributed throughout the cells, whereas in methanol medium the peroxisomes are large, less numerous, and clustered (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Gould et al., 1992</xref>).</p><p>We reveal here the mechanism and players involved in the important interorganellar interplay involving the cytosol, nucleus, peroxisomes, and mitochondria by which peroxisomal and mitochondrial metabolites influence redox and energy metabolism in the two compartments, while also influencing peroxisome biogenesis and proliferation.</p></sec><sec id="s2" sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><sec id="s2-1"><title>Peroxisome proteins/metabolites influence peroxisome size</title><p>We reinvestigated whether peroxisomal metabolites influence peroxisome size and number in <italic>P. pastoris</italic>.

We deleted key genes encoding enzymes of the fatty acids (FA) β-oxidation and methanol metabolism pathways, as well as a peroxin required for the import of peroxisome matrix proteins.

Similarly, the lack of alcohol oxidase (Aox) 1 and 2, the first enzymes in the methanol utilization pathway (MUT), affected peroxisome proliferation only in cells grown in methanol medium (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1</xref>). Similarly, the lack of Pex5, responsible for the import of PTS1-containing enzymes (including some involved in the β-oxidation and MUT pathways), impaired peroxisome proliferation in both media (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1</xref>).

We hypothesized that if peroxisomal proteins/metabolites regulate proliferation, they must communicate with the cytosol and/or other organelles to induce the lipid and membrane transfer needed for peroxisome growth (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib52">Mahalingam et al., 2021</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib66">Reinisch and Prinz, 2021</xref>). Additionally, there must be activation of the fission machinery needed to increase peroxisome numbers (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Huber et al., 2012</xref>).</p><p>In <italic>S. cerevisiae</italic>, the final intraperoxisomal products of β-oxidation are NADH and acetyl-CoA, for cells grown in FA (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1B</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib96">Wanders et al., 2020</xref>). The transport of reducing equivalents out of peroxisomes and the maintenance of the intraperoxisomal redox balance in <italic>S. cerevisiae</italic> is mediated by the malate/oxaloacetate shuttle during growth in oleate, and by both the malate/oxaloacetate and the glycerol-3-phosphate/dihydroxyacetone phosphate (G3P/DHAP) shuttles, during growth in glucose (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Al-Saryi et al., 2017</xref>). The malate/oxaloacetate shuttle is coordinated by three NAD<sup>+</sup>-dependent malate dehydrogenases: the mitochondrial Mdh1 that is part of the TCA cycle, the peroxisomal Mdh3 which regenerates NAD<sup>+</sup> for FA β-oxidation, and cytosolic Mdh2, probably involved in the glyoxylate cycle (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Gabay-Maskit et al., 2020</xref>). The G3P/DHAP shuttle is coordinated by two G3P dehydrogenases: the mitochondrial Gpd2 and peroxisomal/cytosolic Gpd1 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib40">Kumar et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Ansell et al., 1997</xref>). <italic>P. pastoris</italic> possesses only two malate dehydrogenases (designated MdhA or B) and one G3P dehydrogenase (GpdA). We recently reported that MdhA and GpdA are predominantly mitochondrial enzymes in all media analyzed, whereas MdhB is cytosolic during growth in glucose or methanol, but is cytosolic/peroxisomal during growth in oleate (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Farré et al., 2021</xref>). The transport of acetyl-CoA from the peroxisome to the mitochondria uses two pathways (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib91">van Roermund et al., 1995</xref>). The first involves peroxisomal conversion of acetyl-CoA into citrate by peroxisomal citrate synthase (Cit2), followed by citrate transport to mitochondria. The second pathway involves peroxisomal conversion of acetyl-CoA into acetylcarnitine by carnitine acetyl transferase (Cat2), which is then transported to mitochondria.</p><p>With the intent of blocking the shuttling of NADH and acetyl-CoA to the mitochondria, we made single and double deletions of components of both NADH shuttles, and the <italic>CAT2</italic> gene in <italic>P. pastoris</italic> and analyzed peroxisome status after 24 hr of induction in oleate medium using Pex3-GFP and BFP appended with a PTS1 (BFP-SKL) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1C, E</xref>). We observed no, or partial, peroxisome defects in the single NADH-shuttle mutants (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s2">Figure 1—figure supplement 2</xref>). Interestingly, in both double deletion strains, Δ<italic>gpdA</italic> Δ<italic>mdhA</italic> and Δ<italic>gpdA</italic> Δ<italic>mdhB</italic>, as well as Δ<italic>cat2</italic>, most of the cells grown in oleate contained only a single, import-competent peroxisome (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1C</xref>). The results for the NADH-shuttling mutants are consistent with their role in maintaining the intraperoxisomal redox balance and peroxisome proliferation during growth in oleate, but surprisingly the lack of Cat2, not directly implicated in redox balance, had a similar peroxisome proliferation defect.</p><p>As a methylotrophic yeast, <italic>P. pastoris</italic> uses methanol as a sole carbon source for carbon assimilation and energy production (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1B</xref>). Peroxisomes are directly involved in methanol metabolism and similar to oleate, methanol induces peroxisome proliferation. Methanol is metabolized to formaldehyde, which diffuses to the cytosol and is oxidized by a dehydrogenase (Fld1) to formate, which is further oxidized by a second dehydrogenase (Fdh1) to carbon dioxide, yielding NADH. This NADH then shuttles to the mitochondria to maintain the cytosolic redox balance and to feed mitochondrial oxidative phosphorylation (OXPHOS).

Identification of this proliferation factor remains an important future priority.</p><p>We rescued the peroxisome proliferation, peroxisomal protein biogenesis, and division defects in the OXPHOS and Δ<italic>gal83</italic> mutants, by the simultaneous deletion of three genes encoding the transcriptional repressors Mig1, Mig2, and Nrg1 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7</xref>), which repress genes required for peroxisome biogenesis and function (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib81">Shi et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib99">Wang et al., 2016b</xref>). Deletions of the genes for the transcriptional activators, Mit1 and Mxr1, known to activate peroxisome-related genes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib98">Wang et al., 2016a</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib46">Lin-Cereghino et al., 2006</xref>), individually, did not yield the same phenotype as that of the OXPHOS mutants (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6A</xref>), suggesting that these are not directly impaired in the OXPHOS mutants. Additionally, neither overexpression of Mit1, nor artificial activation of Mxr1, rescued the similar phenotypes of the Δ<italic>nugM</italic> and Δ<italic>gal83</italic> mutants (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6B</xref>). Therefore, most of the peroxisome-related phenotypes of the OXPHOS mutants can be explained by the lack of relief of repression of several genes by Mig1, Mig2, and Nrg1, thereby providing a molecular explanation for how the ATP generated by the mitochondria impacts peroxisome proliferation, division, and biogenesis.</p></sec><sec id="s3-5"><title>Working model for interorganellar control of peroxisome dynamics</title><p>We present a working model illustrating the interorganellar transactions, communications, and signaling that must occur in <italic>P. pastoris</italic> between peroxisomes, cytosol, mitochondria, and the nucleus (see <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig10">Figure 10</xref> legend for details) for peroxisome proliferation, division, and biogenesis of peroxisome-associated proteins. FA uptake and its -oxidation produce NADH equivalents and acetyl-CoA. However, the peroxisome membrane is impermeable to large hydrophilic solutes, including NAD<sup>+</sup>, NADH, NADP<sup>+</sup>, and NADPH, as well as ATP, and either acylated or unacylated coenzyme A (CoA) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib96">Wanders et al., 2020</xref>). Consequently, NADH-shuttling proteins, working together in the peroxisomes, cytosol, and mitochondria, allow the delivery of NADH to mitochondria to feed OXPHOS (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Farré et al., 2021</xref>). Acetyl-CoA produced in peroxisomes is delivered to mitochondria via acetyl-carnitine produced in peroxisomes, and mitochondria use the TCA cycle and OXPHOS system for full oxidation to CO<sub>2</sub> and H<sub>2</sub>O (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib96">Wanders et al., 2020</xref>).</p><p>The SNF1/AMPK complex, which is sensitive to the cellular AMP:ATP ratio, maintains the balance between ATP production and consumption in all eukaryotic cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">Kayikci and Nielsen, 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">Kim et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib103">Yan et al., 2018</xref>). Glucose deprivation, which reduces ATP production, activates Snf1 (by phosphorylation) via the action of the Sak1 kinase, and in <italic>P. pastoris</italic>, the nuclear translocation of the SNF1–Gal83 complex requires OXPHOS and ATP production, as shown here. Peroxisome-associated proteins, such as the division protein, Pex11, and the matrix proteins, Pot1 and Aox1, are regulated negatively by transcriptional repressors, that compete with transcriptional activators, such as Mit1 and Mxr1 (equivalent to ScAdr1). Snf1 activation in the cytosol and SNF1–Gal83 entry into the nucleus removes, by phosphorylation of the appropriate proteins, the repression of expression of the peroxisome-associated proteins, while also activating the transcriptional activators. This simultaneous action of SNF1–Gal83 turns on the biogenesis of peroxisome-associated proteins, peroxisome proliferation, as well as division.

In addition, they exchange their metabolites with several cellular compartments, in particular with mitochondria and the cytosol. Owing to this highly interdependent nature of peroxisomes, the regulation of peroxisomal proliferation is carefully controlled and balanced in eukaryotic cells. In the present study, the authors claim that they discovered &quot;THE mechanism by which peroxisomal and mitochondrial metabolites influence redox and energy metabolism, while also influencing peroxisome biogenesis and proliferation, thereby exemplifying interorganellar communication and interplay involving peroxisomes, mitochondria, cytosol and the nucleus&quot; (quoted from the abstract). However, in essence, they show data that yeast mutants in OXPHOS genes induce the Snf1 signaling (which is well known) and that Snf1-dependent signaling reactions are important for peroxisome function (which is also not novel). This study does not considerably increase our understanding of how peroxisomal and mitochondrial functions are coordinated. Identification of the individual contribution of specific proteins, lipids and metabolites that connect peroxisomal function to other processes is difficult. The authors make many assumptions about potential implications of their mutants, for example on the levels of NADH/NAD+, NADPH/NADP+ or ATP without measuring any of these. As it stands, this study is mainly descriptive and does not present the breakthrough the authors proposed. It therefore does not lead to the conceptual advance promised. It might however be suited for a specialized journal.</p></disp-quote><p>The reviewer has fundamentally misunderstood several key points, which makes us dispute the resulting judgment. Based on the reviewer’s statement that it is well known that yeast mutants in OXPHOS gene induce SNF1 signaling, and the fact that SNF1 signaling in oleate induces peroxisome biogenesis, one might have expected the induction of peroxisome biogenesis and proliferation in the OXPHOS mutants. Instead, we show the opposite effect – genes regulated by SNF1 signaling are downregulated in the OXPHOS mutants, despite our finding of Snf1 activation by phosphorylation due to the low ATP status of the cells. We found that Gal83 translocation to the nucleus and the predicted induction of peroxisome biogenesis, division and proliferation caused by Snf1 phosphorylation does not occur in the OXPHOS mutants. Surely, this is a fundamental misunderstanding on the part of the reviewer.</p><p>The reviewer claims incorrectly that Snf1-dependent signaling reactions are known, but this misses the point that despite Snf1 phosphorylation, we see severe defects in peroxisome biogenesis, division and proliferation in OXPHOS mutants. Moreover, the opposite mechanism that the reviewer claims is well known, wherein yeast OXPHOS mutants induce Snf1 signaling, is also not true. Only one publication describes this mechanism and was published this year (Liu et al., 2021). Most importantly, this study has fundamental differences from our paper – their assays were performed in glucose medium, a condition wherein peroxisome metabolism is not required and Snf1 is inactive. In their work, they showed that during glucose incubation, OXPHOS mutants activate Snf1 to upregulate glycolysis.</p><p>We disagree strongly with the statement that “this study does not considerably increase our understanding of how peroxisomal and mitochondrial functions are coordinated”. We show that NADH production in peroxisomes and the cytosol is necessary for OXPHOS, that OXPHOS and ATP production are necessary for peroxisome biogenesis, division and proliferation, and that this mechanism is mediated via Snf1, which despite being canonically activated by phosphorylation, does not result in nuclear translocation of the SNF1-complex subunit, Gal83. Finally, the peroxisome defects in the Δ<italic>nugM</italic> and Δ<italic>gal83</italic> mutants can be rescued by the deletion of three repressor genes that affect these processes (Figure 7).

The authors propose that the cooperation of peroxisomes and mitochondrial respiration is essential to maintain the cellular (cytosolic) NADH/NAD+ ratio. However, this ratio was not measured and assumptions are speculations on the basis of mutants lacking individual enzymes. Genetic probes to measure NADH redox potential (and levels) were recently introduced by several groups and optimized for studies in yeast. These reporters would make it possible to measure NADH redox levels precisely and in specific compartments. Data with such probes would make this study much more interesting for a general audience.</p></disp-quote><p>We agree that measurement of the NAD<sup>+</sup>/NADH ratios will be useful, but we do note that it is common in biology to use mutants proven to affect the production of known metabolites, so it is unfair to say that our conclusions are based on speculations, rather than knowledge of the biochemical pathways involved. Currently available genetic sensors for NAD<sup>+</sup>/NADH have not been applied yet to yeast<italic><sup>1</sup></italic>, or to peroxisomes. However, we successfully implemented SoNar probes in <italic>P. pastoris</italic> and we measured the NAD<sup>+</sup>/NADH ratios in the cytosol and peroxisomes in selected strains representing a good spectrum of this study, and these results are included (new Figure 5A). Since our model is that NAD<sup>+</sup>/NADH ratios affect ATP production, we adapted the Agilent Seahorse instrument, which measures oxygen consumption as a measure of mitochondrial ATP production, to show for the first time in <italic>P. pastoris</italic> that oxygen consumption rates (OCR) are indeed much lower in OXPHOS, AMPK, NADH-shuttling and <italic>pex</italic> mutants, relative to wild-type, and we show these data in Figure 5B.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>2. The authors draw conclusions mainly from microscopic imaging of peroxisomes and from Western Blots with individual peroxisomal proteins. In order to be able to draw conclusions about complex gene expression patterns, for example to delineate the role of Snf1 signaling for peroxisome biogenesis, more unbiased omics datasets would be required. If the authors are not able to perform gene expression analyses they might simply use data previously published by others and focus specifically on genes relevant in the context of peroxisome proliferation. For example, the relevance of Snf1 signaling for mitochondrial function was analyzed in depth in a recent study published in EMBO reports (ref. 103 of this manuscript). This study contains RNAseq data-sets for Snf1-dependent gene expression (EV8) and the authors might just use these data.</p></disp-quote><p>We have indeed explored the possibility of additional insights through published ‘omics datasets, but concluded that they fail to do so at this time. The Snf1 dataset is available only for glucose-grown <italic>S. cerevisiae<sup>2</sup></italic>, and is not so useful because we are looking at induction of peroxisome biogenesis, division and proliferation in <italic>P. pastoris</italic> grown in oleate or methanol. Just as an example, we know, as shown in Figure 4A, C and E, that <italic>PEX11</italic> and <italic>POT1</italic> are induced upon shift of <italic>P. pastoris</italic> from glucose to oleate, concurrently with Snf1 activation (Figure 4D), yet a comparison of the RNA-Seq analysis data from dataset EV8 in the paper from Liu et al., 2021.</p><p>Since the OXPHOS mutants are rescued by deletion of <italic>MIG1</italic>, <italic>MIG2</italic> and <italic>NRG1</italic>, we presume that our genes of interest are targets of this repression. Previous RNA-Seq analysis in <italic>P. pastoris</italic> has shown that the repressors Mig1, Mig2 and Nrg1 are involved in the glucose-mediated repression of genes involved in the metabolism of carbon sources other than glucose, during gluconeogenesis, Krebs cycle and respiration<italic><sup>3, 4</sup></italic>. It has also been shown in <italic>P. pastoris</italic>, that these repressors are involved in the downregulation of methanol utilization, peroxisome biogenesis and peroxisomal metabolic pathways, as well as the transcriptional activator, Mit1<italic><sup>3, 4</sup></italic>. We show here that, in addition, these repressors also repress peroxisome proliferation by an unknown mechanism that might be mediated by their direct or indirect targets. Indeed, about 23% (1197 genes) of <italic>P. pastoris</italic> are downregulated in the Δ<italic>mig1</italic> Δ<italic>mig2</italic> strain and 7% (357 genes) are upregulated<italic><sup>3</sup></italic>. Our finding that the triple mutant (Δ<italic>mig1</italic> Δ<italic>mig2 Δnrg1</italic>) strain rescues the peroxisome biogenesis and proliferation defects of the Δ<italic>nugM</italic> mutant could be accounted for by the induction of one or more of these genes, but the list of genes upregulated by the absence of the repressors is too long, making it challenging to validate whether any of these is responsible for peroxisome proliferation in a reasonable time frame.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>3. The authors make many strong statements about the relevance of their observations based on very indirect assumptions. The authors should downgrade these statements. The abstract should summarize the direct conclusions from experiments. Bold sentences should be removed such as &quot;We uncovered here the mechanism by which peroxisomal and mitochondrial metabolites influence redox and energy metabolism, while also influencing peroxisome biogenesis and proliferation, thereby exemplifying interorganellar communication and interplay involving peroxisomes, mitochondria, cytosol and the nucleus.&quot; (Abstract) This is simply not true! The take-home message is rather 'gene expression is extremely complex, can be regulated at many levels and often includes the integration of many signals' (quoted from page 20). However, unfortunately, this study makes the picture not much clearer than it was before.</p></disp-quote><p>We disagree because the reviewer has based these judgements on an incorrect understanding of our paper.

The metabolite of peroxisome activities, namely NADH, was found to be intervened in the peroxisome-mitochondrion relay of cellular metabolic status. ATP seemed to be the output of mitochondrial activity to support the peroxisome proliferation, since the uncoupler exerted the same inhibitory effects as loss of the NADH shuttling machinery. Blockings of these pathways affected the intra-cellular dynamics of Snf1-kinase complex as evident by Gal83 localization experiments. The inhibitory effects on the peroxisome proliferation by the OXPHOS deficiency were canceled by further deletions of MIG1, MIG2, and NRG1 genes, all of which are transcriptional repressors regulated by Snf1 complex. By contrast, an artificial boosting of Mxr1-Mit1 pathway did not suppress the inhibitory effects.</p><p>Major comments:</p><p>The huge story of this study is well supported by the elaborately arranged experimental data and this study can be highly evaluated as elucidation of the SNF1 function in glucose derepression mechanism. Since most experiments were performed under artificial conditions, it is unclear whether the peroxisomes-mitochondria interplay functions under physiological conditions. What is the physiological significance of downregulating peroxisome proliferation by dysfunction of mitochondria? Indeed, deletion of three transcriptional repressors rescued the phenotype of mitochondrial dysfunction, but it seems that there is no physiological significance because WT cells have these repressors and these just bind promoter regions and repress gene expression. The authors used the term &quot;feedback loop&quot; in this manuscript, but the feedback loop cannot occur under physiological conditions.</p></disp-quote><p>We appreciate the first sentence, which is also supported by Reviewer 3, but contradicts the view of Reviewer 1.</p><p>We agree that the physiological significance of the inappropriate and appropriate induction of peroxisome biogenesis, division and proliferation is important and may not have been stated clearly in our manuscript. The induction and proliferation of peroxisomes requires ATP, as well as the availability of substrates for peroxisomal metabolic pathways. In their absence, one would expect no induction of peroxisome functions. The physiological consequence of deleting <italic>MIG1</italic>, <italic>MIG2</italic> and <italic>NRG1</italic> (i.e. inappropriate peroxisome induction) is published, but had not been cited by us, which is now corrected. Both the Δ<italic>nrg1</italic> and the Δ<italic>mig1</italic> Δ<italic>mig2</italic> mutants do have a fitness cost, as expected, during growth in glucose and glycerol, and less so in methanol<italic><sup>3, 4</sup></italic>.</p><p>The physiological consequences of the inability to appropriately induce peroxisome functions when needed (in oleate and methanol) has been described in the paper along with the pathway involved, which is new. OXPHOS mutants are unable to grow in oleate and methanol, and also cannot divide or proliferate peroxisomes. We clearly disagree with the reviewer that this physiological significance is unclear.</p><p>To be clear, we are not studyng how cells are adapting in the OXPHOS mutants but rather, we are trying to study a mechanism occuring in the WT cells, where mitochondrial ATP is produced due to peroxisome metabolism and this induces peroxisome proliferation. The data presented for Δ<italic>pex14</italic> cells, in which OXPHOS is fine, but peroxisome proliferation is induced by lactate, indicates that we are studying a physiological mechanism.</p><p>The reviewer may not fully understand what we mean by the term “feedback loop”. We believe that in oleate and methanol, NADH production by peroxisomes is necessary for mitochondria to produce ATP, which in turn is required for Snf1/Gal83 activation and induction of peroxisome biogenesis, division and proliferation. These are all happening under physiological conditions of oleate and methanol growth. We hope that our explanation provides a clearer picture of why we disagree with the reviewer statement that “feedback loop cannot occur under physiological conditions.” The feedback loop is explained explicitly in the revision.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Another concern is that the growth curves of various mutant strains were not presented. Mitochondrial dysfunction should have affected the growth on non-fermentative carbon sources and ATP depletion should have affected various basic cellular processes. To know the level of growth defect by each strain, the growth curves of all mutant strains on glucose, oleate, and methanol should be presented in the supplementary.</p></disp-quote><p>While this is easily done, it is busy work that does not add value and it is irrelevant to request this unnecessary information for all strains. Any mutant strains without functional mitochondria will not grow on non-fermentable carbon sources. The reviewer asks for growth information in methanol and oleate, but perhaps misses the point that in the absence of key metabolic enzymes like alcohol oxidase (Aox1) and thiolase required for their utilization, and in the absence of ATP production, there is no growth of the OXPHOS mutants in these media. This information has been added.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Reviewer #2 (Significance (Required)):</p><p>&quot;Feedback loop&quot; has not been verified by experiments, and the manuscript does not contain new new concepts, and the obtained results are within the expected range.</p></disp-quote><p>The reviewer may not have understood what we meant by “feedback loop”, which is explained above and in the text. We believe we have indeed verified the steps of this loop – i.e. the requirement of NADH produced by mitochondria, peroxisomes and NADH shuttles, mitochondrial ATP production, SNF1 activation including Gal83 nuclear translocation and removal of repression by MIG1, MIG2 and NRG1 for peroxisome biogenesis, division and proliferation.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Referee Cross-commenting</p><p>I mostly agree with Reviewer #1's opinion.</p><p>The manuscript contains too many speculation, which should be verified experimentally.

New ATP measurements are in Figure 5B.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Reviewer #3 (Evidence, reproducibility and clarity (Required)):</p><p>The manuscript “OXPHOS deficiencies affect peroxisome proliferation by downregulating genes controlled by the SNF1 signaling pathway&quot; submitted by Farré et al. describes a metabolic signaling network between peroxisomes and mitochondria adjusting peroxisomal abundance to the energetic status of the cell. The authors show, that NADH shuttling from peroxisomes to mitochondria is required to induce peroxisome proliferation when Pichia pastoris is grown on nutrients which are metabolized in peroxisomes (methanol, oleate). Thus, regulation of peroxisome abundance is not directly linked to peroxisomal NADH release but to mitochondrial ATP production by OXPHOS as shown by complex I and complex III mutant strains and uncoupling of ATP production from electron transport chain. As SNF1 is a kinase complex regulating cellular gene expression in response to the cellular ATP status, the authors further analyzed the SNF1-dependency of the observed phenomena. Interestingly, the authors show that the effect of mitochondrial OXPHOS disruption does not take place at the level of SNF1-activation by phosphorylation, but further downstream in the signaling pathway: activated SNF1 is prevented from shuttling to the nucleus in OXPHOS mutant strains, where it would normally induce the release of transcriptional repressors from the promotors of genes for peroxisome proteins. Unfortunately, one last issue – how Gal83-mediated SNF1 nuclear shuttling is altered by the cellular ATP status remains unresolved, which somewhat reduces the impact of the study.</p><p>In general, the manuscript is soundly written, most largely convincing and of a fair experimental quality with adequately replicated experiments and adequate statistical analysis. Before manuscript acceptance, I would suggest, however, some additional control experiments to strengthen further the conclusions drawn by the authors.</p></disp-quote><p>We appreciate the comments and feel that this reviewer does indeed understand fully the significance of our study. We agree that understanding “how Gal83-mediated SNF1 nuclear shuttling is altered by the cellular ATP status” would add to the impact but this is beyond the scope of a few quick experiments.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Major comments:</p><p>1. While the authors effectively block NADH shuttling from peroxisomes to mitochondria, transport of acetyl-CoA produced by peroxisomal β-oxidation of oleate should still be possible via the carnitine shuttle system. In this regard, it is surprising that the ΔmdhB strain and ΔgpdA/ΔmdhB strain show such a considerably strong phenotype as one round of the TCA cycle with peroxisome-derived acetyl-CoA could produce considerably more intramitochondrial NADH as generated by a single round of chain-shortening via peroxisomal β-oxidation (theoretically 3:1). A peroxisomal CRAT (carnitine acetyltransferase) deletion strain could prevent that acetyl-CoA is shuttled out of peroxisomes to be metabolized by the mitochondrial TCA cycle and would be an important additional control. Alternatively, measurement of cytosolic and/or mitochondrial ATP levels could give information how effectively the block of NADH shuttling from peroxisomes compromises mitochondrial ATP production.</p></disp-quote><p>We investigated the CAT2 (peroxisomal CRAT) deletion and found, as hypothesized by the reviewer, that the <italic>cat2Δ</italic> strongly inhibited peroxisome proliferation in oleate and surprisingly also in methanol (new Figure 1 E,F). A recent <italic>P. pastoris</italic> study showed that Cat2 is strongly induced when methanol/glycerol mix is used as the only carbon source and might have a significant role in the methanol assimilatory pathway, which feeds into the TCA cycle<italic><sup>6</sup></italic>. We did not observe a major difference in ATP productions (OCR values in new Figure 5B) between deletions impairing NADH-shuttling proteins and Cat2, but both were significantly lower than wild-type, suggesting that both pathways contribute to ATP production.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>2. Figure 1D: BFP-SKL signals in the ΔgpdA/ΔmdhA strain and ΔgpdA/ΔmdhB strains show a relatively high cytosolic background signal. Does this cytosolic fluorescence signal indicate an incomplete import of matrix proteins in these strains, when cultured on methanol, or is this just unspecific staining?</p></disp-quote><p>It is due to incomplete import due to the use of the strong and constitutive <italic>GAP</italic> promoter to drive BFP-SKL.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>3. Figure 2B, C: While the complex I and III deficient mutants show a good colocalization between BFP-SKL and Pex3-GFP signals, when grown on methanol, all three mutants show bright GFP-SKL signals but appear to be devoid of a specific Pex3-GFP signal, when cultivated on oleate, which is however, not mentioned in the corresponding manuscript text (page 15). In the immunoblots in Figure 4C+D, endogenous Pex3 expression in the complex I ΔnugM strain appears to be unchanged when grown on oleate. The authors should comment on these discrepant findings, since altered Pex3-GFP expression would likely influence peroxisome proliferation capacities in the mutant strains. To clarify this issue, further experimental data on Pex3-GFP levels in the complex I/III mutant strains grown on oleate might be required. Furthermore, it is quite surprising, that according to Figure 4D, Pex3 expression levels do not change in response to methanol- or oelate-induced peroxisome proliferation. This would either mean, that the peroxisomes in glucose grown Pichia (low PO abundance) would exhibit unexpectedly high membrane surface densities of Pex3 if compared to peroxisome under proliferation or that a considerable amount of Pex3 might be localized at the ER, to facilitate a rapid proliferation in response to nutrient change. The authors should add an appropriate comment to the Discussion section.</p></disp-quote><p>In <italic>S. cerevisiae,</italic> PMPs are not induced as much as matrix proteins<italic><sup>7</sup></italic> and similarly in <italic>P. pastoris</italic>, Aox1 can represent more than 50% of cell’s protein. Pex3 is present in glucose media in reasonable amounts and is induced only few-fold several hours after the shift to methanol or oleate in WT or the Δ<italic>nugM</italic> mutant (Figure 4D). However, proteins such as thiolase, Aox1 and Pex11 are fully repressed in glucose and are then strongly induced in oleate and methanol (new Figure 4, figure supplement 1A). Experiments performed in Figure 4 were after 4 hours in the respective media. It is worth noting that the short induction time was chosen to observe Snf1 phosphorylation, which disappears after longer induction in methanol or oleate. Pex3-GFP localization in OXPHOS mutants can be easily observed after longer inductions in oleate (16 h instead of 8h). Figure 2A was replaced with data after a longer induction in oleate.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>4. The authors use an antibody against mammalian phospho-AMPKα to analyze the phosphorylation of SBF1 by immunoblotting. Even if the protein sequence in the correspondent ppSNF1 region is well preserved for such a considerable evolutionary distance, the antibody's potential to specifically recognize only phosphorylated SNF1 should be experimentally verified, since further less conserved regions of SNF1 might influence the protein's general structure. Using a phosphatase treatment in lysates before or after blotting could act as an appropriate control to be presented in a supplemental figure.</p></disp-quote><p>We note that the antibody has extensively been used in <italic>S. cerevisiae</italic>, where they confirm the phosphorylation status<italic><sup>8, 9</sup></italic> and PpSnf1 is an identical protein in this activation loop. This has been added to the text. But we confirmed the specificity by dephosphorylation of proteins fixed on a membrane and included the data as new Figure 4, figure supplement 1B.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>5. A key finding to explain the failure of mig1/mig2/nrg1 de-repression by activated (phospho-)SNF1 in OXPHOS mutants is the inhibition of a Gal83-mediated nuclear SNF1 shuttle in response to ATP-depletion. Unfortunately, the figures of the nuclear localization of Gal83-GFP grown on oleate are hardly convincing. The fluorescent foci in Figure 7 show GFP-signals that appear adjacent to the nucleus but lack the resolution to proof a localization at specific foci within the nucleus.</p></disp-quote><p>We think this in unnecessary because we make no claim about any subnuclear localization of Gal83.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Likewise, all cells with a strong Sec61-RFP/Gal83-GFP colocalisation in Figure S5 appear to be according to the DIC image not in a central focal plane. High resolution images combined with fluorescent nuclear and cytosolic markers should be provided to proof that Gal83-GFP is effectively shuttled into the nucleus in WT Pichia grown on oleate. Alternatively, the authors might analyze that significant fractions of Gal83-GFP enter the nucleus by a subcellular fractionation approach, separating nuclei from cytosol and a microsomal fraction (signals for Gal83-GFP might indicate e.g. a localization to perinuclear ER marked by the Sec61-mCherry probe).</p></disp-quote><p>We agree and replaced the previous Gal83-GFP localization ((old Figure 7) by a new localization (new Figure 8) but in the presence of Leptomycin B (LMB), a potent and specific Crm1 nuclear export inhibitor, required for Gal83 nuclear export in <italic>S. cerevisiae<sup>10</sup></italic>). The presence of the inhibitor allowed us to provide better evidence of Gal83-GFP shuttling to the nucleus in WT cells during peroxisome proliferation conditions and the lack of this shuttling in the mitochondrial mutant.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Reviewer #3 (Significance (Required)):</p><p>Currently, there is increasing evidence that organelles have to communicate directly via physical contacts or indirectly across the cytosol with each other to maintain cellular homeostasis. Peroxisomes, which are highly dynamic organelles specialized in lipid catabolism and in yeast species methanol oxidation, have to be adjusted in number and protein composition to the current metabolic state of the cell. Despite this obvious need for organelle plasticity, there is still only scarce information on the cellular signaling networks, which control peroxisome abundance within a cell. Moreover, peroxisomes do seldom house complete metabolic pathways but have to exchange metabolic intermediates with other cellular compartments such as the endoplasmic reticulum or mitochondria. Of note, mitochondria are often found to be compromised in patient cells with peroxisomal gene defects underlining the strong functional relationship between both organelles. In addition to their metabolic cooperation in e.g. β-oxidation of fatty acids or catabolism of reactive oxygen species, both organelles are linked at the level of their fission pathways, as they use an overlapping protein assembly for this process. Therefore, the manuscripts presents an intriguing finding and extension to the concept of an intricate communication between peroxisomes and mitochondria, that peroxisomal abundance can be controlled via a signaling network regulated by mitochondrial ATP production in the yeast Pichia pastoris. In this context, the manuscript nicely exemplifies how a relatively simple but straightforward feedback mechanism is able to effectively adjust pathways of energy production to current nutrient availability via an SNF1-dependent ATP-sensitive cross-organellar signaling network.</p></disp-quote><p>This reviewer clearly spells out the key points of our paper accurately and fairly. We appreciate the careful analysis.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Since mammalian cells possess with AMPKA a direct orthologue of SNF1, the authors speculate, that a similar signaling network linking peroxisome abundance to mitochondrial energy production could likewise exist in humans. However, it should be taken into consideration that unlike in yeast species, which exclusively metabolize fatty acids and methanol in peroxisomes for energy production, their counterparts in mammalian cells are of low abundance. Thus, they are able to contribute only with a minor percentage to net cellular energy production but are rather organelles specialized on metabolizing low abundant very long chain and branched chain fatty acids, which are in higher concentrations toxic for cells. Therefore, the direct transferability of the findings to mammals might be limited and need further evaluation. Nevertheless, even if a direct extrapolation of the findings to the human situation might not be adequate, the manuscript still introduces a principal and exemplary mechanism regulating cellular homeostasis via an organellar communication network and is thus of general interest for the cell biological community.</p></disp-quote><p>We agree.</p><p>In summary, we have dealt with all of the questions and suggestions of the reviewers.
