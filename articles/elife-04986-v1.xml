We present two crystal structures of engineered U1 sub-structures, which together reveal at atomic resolution an almost complete network of protein–protein and RNA-protein interactions within U1 snRNP, and show how the 5′ splice site of pre-mRNA is recognised by U1 snRNP. The zinc-finger of U1-C interacts with the duplex between pre-mRNA and the 5′-end of U1 snRNA. The binding of the RNA duplex is stabilized by hydrogen bonds and electrostatic interactions between U1-C and the RNA backbone around the splice junction but U1-C makes no base-specific contacts with pre-mRNA. The structure, together with RNA binding assays, shows that the selection of 5′-splice site nucleotides by U1 snRNP is achieved predominantly through basepairing with U1 snRNA whilst U1-C fine-tunes relative affinities of mismatched 5′-splice sites.</p><p><bold>DOI:</bold> <ext-link ext-link-type="doi" xlink:href="10.7554/eLife.04986.001">http://dx.doi.org/10.7554/eLife.04986.001</ext-link></p></abstract><abstract abstract-type="executive-summary"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.04986.002</object-id><title>eLife digest</title><p>Genes are made up of long stretches of DNA. The regions of a gene that code for proteins (known as exons) are interrupted by stretches of non-coding DNA called introns. To produce proteins from a gene, the DNA is ‘transcribed’ to form pre-mRNA molecules, from which the introns must be removed in a process called splicing. The remaining exons are then joined together to form a mature mRNA molecule that contains the instructions to build a protein. Errors in the splicing process can lead to numerous diseases, such as cancer.</p><p>A molecular machine known as a spliceosome is responsible for splicing the pre-mRNA molecules. This consists of five different complexes called small nuclear ribonucleoprotein particles (snRNPs), which are in turn made up from numerous proteins and RNA molecules. The spliceosome assembles anew every time it splices, and an early step in this assembly process involves the interaction of an snRNP called U1 with the start of an intron in the pre-mRNA. This interaction then stimulates the assembly of the rest of the spliceosome. In 2009, researchers reported the structure of the U1 snRNP, but the structure did not contain enough detail to reveal how the snRNP recognizes the start of an intron.</p><p>Kondo, Oubridge et al., including some of the researchers involved in the 2009 work, now present the crystal structure of the human version of the U1 snRNP in more detail. High-quality crystal structures of the complete U1 snRNP molecule could not be obtained because the arrangement of the RNA molecules in the snRNP prevented a regular crystal from forming. Kondo, Oubridge et al. instead engineered two subcomponents of U1 snRNP that each crystallized well, and determined their structures. This revealed that the interactions between the various parts of the U1 snRNP form a complex network.</p><p>A protein present in the U1 snRNP, known as U1-C, had previously been reported to be able to recognize introns on its own—without requiring the complete U1 snRNP. Kondo, Oubridge et al. reveal that this is not the case and that U1-C does not read the intron RNA sequence directly. Instead, U1 snRNP is able to find the start of the intron because the U1 RNA can stably bind to this site. The U1-C protein can however adjust the strength of this binding to ensure that the spliceosome can operate with a variety of intron start sequences (or signals).</p><p><bold>DOI:</bold> <ext-link ext-link-type="doi" xlink:href="10.7554/eLife.04986.002">http://dx.doi.org/10.7554/eLife.04986.002</ext-link></p></abstract><kwd-group kwd-group-type="author-keywords"><title>Author keywords</title><kwd>pre-mRNA splicing</kwd><kwd>crystallography</kwd><kwd>spliceosome</kwd><kwd>U1 snRNP</kwd><kwd>5′ splice site</kwd></kwd-group><kwd-group kwd-group-type="research-organism"><title>Research organism</title><kwd>Human</kwd></kwd-group><funding-group><award-group id="par-1"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100000265</institution-id><institution>Medical Research Council</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>U105184330</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Nagai</surname><given-names>Kiyoshi</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><funding-statement>The funder had no role in study design, data collection and interpretation, or the decision to submit the work for publication.</funding-statement></funding-group><custom-meta-group><custom-meta><meta-name>elife-xml-version</meta-name><meta-value>2.0</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta specific-use="meta-only"><meta-name>Author impact statement</meta-name><meta-value>The complete architecture of human spliceosomal U1 snRNP and its interaction with the 5′ splice site of pre-mRNA are described in atomic detail.</meta-value></custom-meta></custom-meta-group></article-meta></front><body><sec id="s1" sec-type="intro"><title>Introduction</title><p>Removal of introns from pre-messenger RNA (pre-mRNA) is an essential step in eukaryotic gene expression. This process is catalysed by a large and dynamic RNA-protein assembly called the spliceosome, which consists of five small nuclear ribonucleoprotein particles (U1, U2, U4, U5 and U6 snRNPs) and numerous non-snRNP proteins (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib66">Will and Lührmann, 2011</xref>). U1 snRNP recognizes a short sequence at the 5′-splice site (5′SS) of pre-mRNA through basepairing between the 5′-end of U1 snRNA and the 5′SS sequence (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Lerner et al., 1980</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib68">Zhuang and Weiner, 1986</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib57">Siliciano and Guthrie, 1988</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib54">Séraphin et al., 1988</xref>) and promotes an ordered assembly of the four remaining snRNPs to form the spliceosome, which then undergoes extensive conformational and compositional remodelings to become catalytically active (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib66">Will and Lührmann, 2011</xref>). During activation, the interaction between U1 snRNP and the 5′SS is disrupted by RNA helicase Prp28 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib60">Staley and Guthrie, 1999</xref>) and then the 5′SS intron sequence base-pairs with part of the ACAGAGA box in U6 snRNA (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib51">Sawa and Abelson, 1992</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib52">Sawa and Shimura, 1992</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib63">Wassarman and Steitz, 1992</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Kandels-Lewis and Séraphin, 1993</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25a">Lesser and Guthrie, 1993</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib58">Sontheimer and Steitz, 1993</xref>); whilst the 5′ exon interacts with U5 snRNA loop I for the first <italic>trans</italic>-esterification reaction (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">Newman and Norman, 1992</xref>). U1 snRNP is also an important regulator of mRNA 3′ end cleavage and polyadenylation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Almada et al., 2013</xref>; reviewed in <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib59">Spraggon and Cartegni (2013)</xref>).</p><p>Human U1 snRNP comprises U1 snRNA, seven Sm proteins (SmB/SmB′, SmD1, SmD2, SmD3, SmE, SmF and SmG) and three U1-specific proteins (U1-70K, U1-A and U1-C) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Hinterberger et al., 1983</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Bringmann and Lührmann, 1986</xref>). We reported the structure of the functional core of U1 snRNP (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib41">Pomeranz Krummel et al., 2009</xref>) based on an experimental electron density map at 5.5 Å resolution to which we fitted previously-determined structures of protein components (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Kambach et al., 1999</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Muto et al., 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Leung, 2005</xref>). The most striking feature of the structure is the N-terminal region of U1-70k, which extends from its RRM through a long α-helix and wraps around the Sm protein assembly so that its N-terminus makes contact with U1-C protein, thus accounting for the requirement of U1-70k for U1-C binding (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">Nelissen et al., 1994</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Hilleren et al., 1995</xref>). In this crystal the 5′-end of U1 snRNA pairs with its symmetry-related counterpart, mimicking the binding of the 5′SS of pre-mRNA to U1 snRNP. The Zn-finger domain of U1-C is located adjacent to this RNA duplex but the low-resolution map was insufficient for analysis of the RNA-protein contacts in atomic detail and hence it was not clear how U1-C contributes to the recognition of the 5′SS. The structure of U1 snRNP from HeLa cells, treated with chymotrypsin, was subsequently reported (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib64">Weber et al., 2010</xref>). Although this crystal had a DNA oligonucleotide with the 5′SS consensus sequence bound to the 5′-end of U1 snRNA, the N-terminal end of U1-70k together with U1-C protein were lost by protease treatment. Hence neither of these structures revealed molecular details of 5′SS recognition by U1 snRNP.</p><p>In order to gain crucial insight into the mechanism of 5′SS recognition we continued our attempts to grow crystals of U1 snRNP diffracting to high resolution but this proved unsuccessful because the inherent mobility of long RNA helices arranged as a 4-way junction prevented the formation of well-diffracting crystals (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib40">Oubridge et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib64">Weber et al., 2010</xref>). Hence we designed two sub-structures of U1 snRNP, with exclusively human sequences, based on our 5.5 Å resolution structure and determined their crystal structures at high resolution.</p><p>Yeast U1 snRNP, when compared to the human particle, contains a larger and more complex snRNA, which is associated with many protein factors (Prp39, Snu71, Prp40, Prp42, Nam8, Snu56, Urn1 and Prp5), which have no counterparts in human U1 snRNP (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">Neubauer et al., 1997</xref>). However, despite these differences, the sequence of the 5′-single stranded region of U1 snRNA (nts 1–10) is invariant from yeast to human (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://rfam.sanger.ac.uk/">http://rfam.sanger.ac.uk/</ext-link>) and the amino acid sequence of the Zn-finger of U1-C (yeast Yhc1) is also highly conserved (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Muto et al., 2004</xref>). Hence the 5′SS of pre-mRNA is expected to make exactly the same contacts with the 5′ end of U1 snRNA and U1-C in human and yeast U1 snRNPs. However, some positions of the 5′SS have quite different nucleotide bias in yeast and human genes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Burge et al., 1999</xref>). In human the 5′SS sequences processed by major spliceosomes are degenerate but show significant overall complementarity to the sequence of the 5′ end of U1 snRNA (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Lerner et al., 1980</xref>). In contrast the 5′SS intron sequence of yeast pre-mRNA is stringently conserved to be GUAUGU (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Burge et al., 1999</xref>). Upon activation of the yeast spliceosome, the intron sequence, UGU (+4, +5 and +6), pairs with ACA within the ACAGAGA sequence in U6 snRNA and hence these nucleotides are selected to be nearly invariant (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib51">Sawa and Abelson, 1992</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Kandels-Lewis and Séraphin, 1993</xref>). Cross-linking studies revealed interaction of the same regions of U6 snRNA and the 5′SS sequence in human but the sequence requirement is less obvious (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib52">Sawa and Shimura, 1992</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib63">Wassarman and Steitz, 1992</xref>). Prp8 is also known to influence the selection of the 5′SS nucleotide (reviewed in <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Grainger and Beggs (2005)</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Galej et al. (2013)</xref>). Furthermore in humans constitutive or alternative splicing factors facilitate the binding of U1 snRNP to weak splice sites. As discussed above, the 5′SS is subjected to multiple selections which differ in yeast and human and give rise to different nucleotide biases at 5′SS. The strength of variant 5′SS sequences is assessed by relative usage of competing 5′SS (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib49">Roca et al., 2005</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib47">2012</xref>) which is determined not only by the affinity of 5′SS to U1 snRNP but also by multiple factors (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib48">Roca et al., 2013</xref>).</p><p>Our two new crystals together reveal the structures of the substantial parts of U1 snRNP at high resolution and provide crucial insights into the mechanism of pre-mRNA recognition by U1 snRNP. In particular, we find that U1-C makes no base-specific contacts with the 5′SS sequence. Also, by measuring the intrinsic affinity of recombinant U1 snRNP for various 5′SS sequences we disentangle the role played by the U1 snRNP from the other complexities of 5′SS recognition, and assess the relative contributions of U1 snRNA and U1-C protein in light of our crystal structure.</p></sec><sec id="s2" sec-type="results|discussion"><title>Results and discussion</title><p>A minimal U1 snRNP consisting of seven Sm proteins, the N-terminal peptide of U1-70k, U1-C and a truncated U1 snRNA was designed based on the 5.5 Å resolution structure (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1A</xref>; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1 fig1s2">Figure 1—figure supplements 1 and 2</xref>) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib41">Pomeranz Krummel et al., 2009</xref>). A large portion of RNA attached to Helix H through the 4-way junction was replaced by a kissing-loop (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Ennifar et al., 2001</xref>) to facilitate crystal contacts (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s2">Figure 1—figure supplement 2</xref>). However, this eliminated the binding site (stem-loop I) for the U1-70k RRM (RNA-recognition motif) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib43">Query et al., 1989</xref>) and thus weakened the binding of the U1-70k N-terminal peptide to the snRNP core domain (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">Nelissen et al., 1994</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Hilleren et al., 1995</xref>).

fits well into the 5.5 Å electron density except for a slight tilt of the duplex between pre-mRNA and the 5′-end of U1 snRNA (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1C</xref>) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib41">Pomeranz Krummel et al., 2009</xref>). In the previous structure the fortuitous interaction between the 5′-end of U1 snRNA from two symmetry-related complexes could have distorted the orientation of this RNA duplex. Hence we believe that the minimal U1 snRNP, with the consensus 5′SS oligonucleotide bound to the 5′-end of U1 snRNA, represents the 5′SS-U1 snRNP interaction in the whole U1 snRNP. The overall structure of the core domain is very similar to that of the U4 snRNP core domain, which consists of seven Sm proteins and U4 snRNA (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Leung et al., 2011</xref>) and the Sm folds of the seven Sm protein assemblies of the two structures (PDB code: 4PJO and 4WZJ) superimpose with rmsd of 0.55 Å. However, there are some noteworthy differences (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s1">Figure 2—figure supplement 1</xref>). In the minimal U1 snRNP, helix H0 of SmD2 points into the minor groove of helix H (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1A</xref>), buttressing it, a feature already evident at 5.5 Å (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib41">Pomeranz Krummel et al., 2009</xref>). The nonamer Sm site sequence (AAUUUGUGG in U1 snRNA and AAUUUUUGA in U4 snRNA) has been reported as a minimal RNA oligonucleotide to promote Sm core domain assembly (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib44">Raker et al., 1999</xref>). In U1 snRNP each base of the first seven nucleotides of the nonamer, AAUUUGU (A125 to U131), interacts one-to-one with SmF-SmE-SmG-SmD3-SmB-SmD1-SmD2 in the pockets formed by four key residues at equivalent positions in the L3 and L5 loops of the Sm fold except for the interaction of G130 with SmD1 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2</xref>; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s1">Figure 2—figure supplement 1</xref>). In the protease-treated U1 snRNP structure (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib64">Weber et al., 2010</xref>), G132 was placed in the nucleotide-binding pocket in SmF but our structure unambiguously shows that A125 occupies this pocket. The U4 core snRNP structure has now been refined to an R<sub>free</sub> of 22.4% (Li, Leung, YK, CO and KN, manuscript in preparation; PDB code: 4WZJ) and the new model shows that whereas previously the G equivalent to G132 was also incorrectly placed in SmF (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Leung et al., 2011</xref>) the Sm site nucleotides bind in a similar manner in both minimal U1 and U4 core domain, except for SmD1. The fourth U of the U4 Sm site sequence is replaced by G in U1 snRNA in the majority of species including humans (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://rfam.sanger.ac.uk/">http://rfam.sanger.ac.uk/</ext-link>) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Burge et al., 2012</xref>).

In the Sm site sequence the phosphate groups of A126, U130 and U131 come close and are stabilized by a hydrated Mg<sup>++</sup> ion (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2</xref>). The last two nucleotides of the nonamer, G132 and G133, fit into the binding pocket formed by SmD1-SmD2 and SmF-SmE, respectively (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s2">Figure 2—figure supplement 2</xref>).<fig-group><fig id="fig2" position="float"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.04986.007</object-id><label>Figure 2.</label><caption><title>Stereoview showing binding of U1 snRNA at the central hole of the Sm protein assembly.</title><p>The refined model is overlaid onto the 3.3 Å electron density map (2Fo − Fc) contoured at 1.5σ.

Its purine base contacts SmB L3 residue Lys36.

The nucleotides equivalent to A126 and G132 were misplaced in the original U4 core snRNP structure (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Leung et al., 2011</xref>) but show interactions similar to those observed here after further refinement (Li J, Leung AKW, CJO, YK and KN, manuscript in preparation).</p><p><bold>DOI:</bold> <ext-link ext-link-type="doi" xlink:href="10.7554/eLife.04986.008">http://dx.doi.org/10.7554/eLife.04986.008</ext-link></p></caption><graphic xlink:href="elife-04986-fig2-figsupp1-v1"/></fig><fig id="fig2s2" position="float" specific-use="child-fig"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.04986.009</object-id><label>Figure 2—figure supplement 2.</label><caption><title>The nucleotides G132, G133 and U134 in the central hole of the Sm protein assembly.</title><p><bold>DOI:</bold> <ext-link ext-link-type="doi" xlink:href="10.7554/eLife.04986.009">http://dx.doi.org/10.7554/eLife.04986.009</ext-link></p></caption><graphic xlink:href="elife-04986-fig2-figsupp2-v1"/></fig></fig-group></p><p>In the original 5.5 Å resolution map we roughly modelled the first 60 residues of U1-70k using seleno-methionine derivatives of mutants of U1-70K (L9M, I19M, E31M, I41M, E49M, E61M and I75M). In the 3.3 Å structure almost the entire length of the U1-70k N-terminal peptide is well ordered and its interaction with the core domain is revealed in detail (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3</xref>). Residues 49–58, containing a type II proline helix (Pro55, Pro56 and Pro57), interact exclusively with SmD2 and its binding to SmD2 is stabilized by salt-bridges and hydrogen bonds (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3A</xref>). The U1-70k residues 39–49 are wedged in the crevice between SmD2 and SmF (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3B</xref>). Then the U1-70k peptide crosses the central hole where it interacts with the backbone and bases of stem IV (A135 to G138) of U1 snRNA (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3C</xref>). The 3′ stem of U4 snRNA (stem II) blocks the path of the U1-70k peptide in the U4 core domain and hence the binding of this peptide is snRNA dependent (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Leung et al., 2011</xref>). The U1-70k residues 10–31 make extensive contacts as an extended peptide with SmD3 and the β4 strand of SmB (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3D</xref>; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4A</xref>). The residues 6–12 of U1-70k form a 3<sub>10</sub> helix and together with its N-terminal region contact the long helix B of U1-C to stabilize U1-C binding (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4A</xref>). Apart from the interaction with U1-70k, U1-C interacts exclusively with SmD3. Helix A and β1 of the Zn-finger and part of long Helix B of U1-C sit on the concave surface of SmD3 made by the N-terminal helix 1, β2 strand and loop 2 and a short α-helix made by the C-terminal tail. The interface between U1-C and SmD3 is not tightly packed and is stabilized by salt-bridges and hydrogen bonds (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4A</xref>). The R21Q mutation in U1-C weakens its binding to U1 snRNP by about 10-fold (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Muto et al., 2004</xref>).<fig id="fig3" position="float"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.04986.010</object-id><label>Figure 3.</label><caption><title>The path of the N-terminal peptide of U1-70k.</title><p>The N-terminal 60 residues of U1-70k run along the interface between SmD2 and SmF, cross the central hole and are wedged between SmB and SmD3 (Inset shows the overview).

It also has uridines at positions 5 and 6 instead of the pseudo-uridines found in natural U1 snRNA (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib45">Reddy et al., 1981</xref>). Pseudo-uridines at these positions are conserved from yeast to human U1 snRNA (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Massenet et al., 1999</xref>). Only poorly diffracting crystals were obtained with pseudo-uridines at these positions. In the minimal U1 snRNP crystal, nucleotides 3 to 10 of U1 snRNA form Watson-Crick basepairs with the AG/GUAAGU sequence of the pre-mRNA strand (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4B–C</xref>) where / marks the splice junction. The minor groove of the RNA duplex between the 5′SS and the 5′-end of U1 snRNA interacts with U1-C on the surface made by Helix A and the β1 strand. Several amino-acid side chains and main chain atoms of U1-C form hydrogen bonds with the 2′OH groups and phosphate oxygen atoms of both strands of RNA near the splice junction (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4B–C</xref>). However, U1-C makes no contacts with the RNA bases (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4B</xref>). At an early stage of spliceosomal assembly, U1 snRNP binds to the 5′SS and U2 auxiliary factor (U2AF) and splicing factor 1 (SF1) bind to the 3′ splice site and branch point resulting in the formation of E complex. A double mutant (R28G, K29S) of U1-C fails to enhance the formation of E complex (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib67">Will et al., 1996</xref>). The side-chains of Arg28 and Lys29 are located close to the phosphate backbone of U1 snRNA or 5′SS RNA but their side chains have no density in our map. The 5′-triphosphate of U1 snRNA is close to Glu32 and Asp36 of U1-C and their electrostatic repulsion may prevent stable interaction of the tri-methylguanosine cap with U1-C, thus allowing the pre-mRNA strand to gain access to bases of the 5′-end of U1 snRNA to pair.</p><sec id="s2-1"><title>Interaction between U1-70k and stem-loop I</title><p>The first 215 residues of U1-70k are conserved well from yeast to human (48% sequence similarity), suggesting that this region has an evolutionarily conserved essential function, whereas the C-terminal region, predicted to be poorly structured, has diverged considerably.

The U1A70kF-RNA crystal structure (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1B</xref>) reveals the interaction between stem-loop I and U1-70k in detail, illustrating a new mode of RRM-RNA interaction. The canonical RRM domain is known to bind with RNA through RNP1 and RNP2 motifs as first observed in the U1A- stem loop II complex structure (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">Oubridge et al., 1994</xref>). The RRMs of U1-A and U1-70k have very similar structures (the β-strands and α-helices of the two RRMs superimpose with an rmsd of 0.70 Å) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5A–B</xref>) whereas the RNA loops bound to these RRMs have strikingly different structures (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5C–D</xref>). The U1-A bound RNA loop has an open structure with ten nucleotide bases splayed out (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5B,D</xref>) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">Oubridge et al., 1994</xref>). Bases of the first seven loop nucleotides show stacking interactions, either with adjacent bases or with protein side chains, while the last three nucleotides are poorly ordered. In contrast, the U1-70k bound RNA loop 1 with 11 loop nucleotides (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1C</xref>) is stabilized by base stacking interactions and basepairing of nucleotides within the loop and hence it is effectively a five-nucleotide loop (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5A–C</xref>). In U1-A the polypeptide loop between β2 and β3 (loop 3) protrudes through the RNA loop, stabilising it in an open conformation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5B</xref>) whereas loop 3 of U1-70k forms a β-turn and embraces C33 and G34 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5A</xref>). The bases of C33 and G34 stack with each other and are sandwiched between the side chains of Arg191 and Lys138, which form salt-bridges with the phosphate groups of C33 and G34 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6A</xref>).

The observed frequency tends to be higher in the middle and taper off towards both ends because mismatches affect the stability of the duplex less when they are further away from the middle. The first two intron nucleotides, which pair with C8 and A7 of U1 snRNA, are nearly invariantly GU (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Burge et al., 1999</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib56">Sheth et al., 2006</xref>) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4C</xref>; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7C</xref>). The nucleotides at +3 and +4 pair with Ψ6 and Ψ5 of U1 snRNA, respectively, and A/G are found at +3 but A is found predominantly at +4. G is preferred at positions −1 and +5 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7B</xref>), which pair with C9 and C4 of U1 snRNA, whilst U is preferred at +6. As the filter-binding assay described above requires large amounts of U1 snRNP, we studied binding of different 5′SS sequences to U1 snRNP by competition assay using a short, fluorescently-labelled oligonucleotide as a reference (<xref ref-type="table" rid="tbl2">Table 2</xref>). We found that a labelled consensus sequence oligonucleotide bound too tightly to be competed off by the weaker competitor oligonucleotides at concentrations that could be feasibly achieved in the experiment. Hence we used a mismatched labelled oligonucleotide (5SS-F). This does not influence the experiment's capacity to show whether one oligonucleotide competes better or worse than another. Single nucleotide substitutions at highly conserved positions substantially reduce the affinity of the 5′SS oligonucleotide for U1 snRNP (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7C</xref>). For example, substitution of G at −1, +1 and +5 with C drastically reduces the binding of the competitor oligonucleotide (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7C</xref>) as C does not form a stable basepair with C (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Leontis et al., 2002</xref>). Furthermore, substitution of +2U with an A severely reduces the binding affinity, presumably because an A–A mismatch distorts and destabilizes the duplex itself (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Leontis et al., 2002</xref>) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7C</xref>). The affinity of +2C 5′SS RNA is higher than that of +2A (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7C</xref>) presumably because cytosine could form a wobble basepair with a protonated A (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Gao and Patel, 1987</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Jang et al., 1998</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib65">Wild et al., 2001</xref>). This is consistent with the fact that C is found at +2 position, although very infrequently. G at +3 and +4 could form a wobble basepair with Ψ6 and Ψ5, respectively, and substitution of A with G at +3 or +4 position has only a moderate effect on the affinity (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7D</xref>). The 5′SS with a G − Ψ wobble basepair at +4 position (+4G) has higher affinity than the one at +3 position (+3G) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7C</xref>) whilst +3G occurs more frequently in human genes (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7B</xref>) than +4G. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib47">Roca et al. (2012)</xref> reported the effect of three single base substitutions in the 5′SS on the melting temperature of the duplex between 5′SS oligonucleotides and an oligonucleotide representing the 5′-end of U1 snRNA. +1A and +2C both had severe effects on melting temperature, in agreement with our results. Most other mutations they studied introduced a bulged nucleotide. Here we did not include such 5′SS oligonucleotides in our analysis, as it is hard to predict the effect of the bulged nucleotide on the molecular contacts observed in our crystal structure. We next studied binding of the same set of the 5′SS oligonucleotides to U1 snRNP in the absence of U1-C (U1 snRNP[ΔU1-C]) to see how U1-C contributes to the selection of 5′SS oligonucleotides (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7E,F</xref>). To a first approximation these 5′SS mutants show very similar affinities relative to the wild type both in the absence and presence of U1-C, enforcing the notion that 5′SS are selected primarily by U1 snRNA. In the absence of U1-C, the mutant 5′SS oligonucleotides with +3G or +4G compete well with the wild type as in the presence of U1-C but other oligonucleotides with +3U, +4U, +1C, −1C or +5C mutations compete better in the presence of U1-C than in its absence. This shows that U1-C fine-tunes the affinity of these mismatched oligonucleotides, in most sequences studied here, to provide extra stabilisation relative to the wild type. For example, in the presence of U1-C the oligonucleotides with +3U or +4U, which introduce U–U mismatches, compete better with the wild type than they do in the absence of U1-C. Different types of U–U basepair have been reported (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Lietzke et al., 1996</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Leontis et al., 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Kiliszek et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib55">Sheng et al., 2013</xref>). Our crystal structure showed that U1-C forms hydrogen bonds exclusively with sugar-phosphate backbone between −2 to +3 positions of pre-mRNA and at C9 and G11 of U1 snRNA (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4B–C</xref>). When extra hydrogen bonding groups are provided by U1-C, the U–U pair could easily switch from one type to another. It is conceivable that these amino acid residues of U1-C could provide extra stabilization for these non-canonical basepairs, possibly by altering helical geometry and/or minor groove width.<table-wrap id="tbl2" position="float"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.04986.015</object-id><label>Table 2.</label><caption><p>5′splice site binding</p><p><bold>DOI:</bold> <ext-link ext-link-type="doi" xlink:href="10.7554/eLife.04986.015">http://dx.doi.org/10.7554/eLife.04986.015</ext-link></p></caption><table frame="hsides" rules="groups"><thead><tr><th>Oligo name</th><th>Sequence<xref ref-type="table-fn" rid="tblfn4">*</xref></th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td><bold>5ss-F</bold></td><td><bold>AGGAAAGUAU-F</bold><xref ref-type="table-fn" rid="tblfn5">†</xref></td></tr><tr><td>WT</td><td>CAAAGGUAAGUUGGA</td></tr><tr><td>−1C</td><td>CAAA<bold>C</bold>GUAAGUUGGA</td></tr><tr><td>+1C</td><td>CAAAG<bold>C</bold>UAAGUUGGA</td></tr><tr><td>+2A</td><td>CAAAGG<bold>A</bold>AAGUUGGA</td></tr><tr><td>+2C</td><td>CAAAGG<bold>C</bold>AAGUUGGA</td></tr><tr><td>+3U</td><td>CAAAGGU<bold>U</bold>AGUUGGA</td></tr><tr><td>+3G</td><td>CAAAGGU<bold>G</bold>AGUUGGA</td></tr><tr><td>+4U</td><td>CAAAGGUA<bold>U</bold>GUUGGA</td></tr><tr><td>+4G</td><td>CAAAGGUA<bold>G</bold>GUUGGA</td></tr><tr><td>+5C</td><td>CAAAGGUAA<bold>C</bold>UUGGA</td></tr></tbody></table><table-wrap-foot><fn id="tblfn4"><label>*</label><p><bold>Bold</bold> nucleotides highlight the position of mismatch.</p></fn><fn id="tblfn5"><label>†</label><p>F denotes 3′-fluorescein label.</p></fn></table-wrap-foot></table-wrap></p><p>It has been proposed that U1 snRNP selects the same 5′SS sequence even in the absence of the 5′-end of U1 snRNA (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Du and Rosbash, 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Lund and Kjems, 2002</xref>), and that U1C in isolation can recognize the 5′SS sequence. This conclusion is mainly based on a SELEX experiment, which may have been prone to an artefact caused by incomplete removal of the 5′-end of U1 snRNA. We observed no binding of 5′SS oligonucleotide by human U1-C protein, which was shown to be properly folded by NMR (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Muto et al., 2004</xref>). <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib53">Schwer and Shuman (2014)</xref> investigated the role of conserved basic and hydrophilic residues in yeast U1-C: they mutated residues that form hydrogen bonds with the backbone atoms of either 5′SS (Thr11, Thr14, Tyr12 and His24) or U1 snRNA (His15 and Ser19), form a salt-bridge with SmD3 (Arg21) or lie near the phosphate backbone (Lys22 and Arg28 [Lys28 in yeast]) in our crystal structure (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4</xref>). Substitution of any one of these residues with Ala had no effect on yeast growth at any temperature indicating that these mutations do not have a major influence on 5′SS selectivity, in agreement with our conclusion.</p></sec><sec id="s2-3"><title>Conclusions</title><p>The structures of two sub-domains of U1 snRNP reported here have revealed an intricate network of interactions between the components of U1 snRNP. U1-70k N-terminal peptide binds to the subunit interfaces between SmD2 and SmF, and between SmD3 and SmB, and hence only the fully-formed core domain can induce its binding, which in turn enables U1-C to bind the core domain. Our structure also revealed the molecular contacts between U1 snRNP and the 5′SS of pre-mRNA and provided new insights into the molecular mechanism of 5′SS selection. U1-C makes no contacts with nucleotide bases and U1 snRNP selects 5′SS sequences primarily by thermodynamic stability of the RNA duplex between the 5′-end of U1 snRNA and the 5′SS. However U1-C fine-tunes the affinity to stabilize the binding of some mismatched 5′SS oligonucleotides relative to the canonical 5′SS.</p></sec></sec><sec id="s3" sec-type="materials|methods"><title>Materials and methods</title><sec id="s3-1"><title>Protein preparation</title><p>The SmE/SmF/SmG trimer, the SmD1/SmD2 dimer, the SmB/SmD3 dimer, U1-A, U1-70k and U1-C were prepared as described previously (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">Oubridge et al., 1994</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Kambach et al., 1999</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Muto et al., 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib41">Pomeranz Krummel et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Leung et al., 2011</xref>).

Crystals were transferred to cryo-protection buffer (20% MPD, 200 mM KCl, 5 mM MgSO<sub>4</sub>, 50 mM Na<sup>+</sup>-Hepes pH 6.4, 25% PEG4000) in three steps with 30 min equilibration after each transfer and flash frozen in liquid nitrogen.</p></sec><sec id="s3-7"><title>Crystallization of the U1A70kF RNA complex</title><p>The U1A70kF RNA complex was mixed with an equal volume of 40% MPD, 0.15 M NaCl, 0.1 M sodium acetate pH 4.2 and equilibrated with the same solution by sitting drop vapour diffusion at 20°C. Crystals of type I (wedge-shaped) grew within 16–48 hr whereas crystals of type II (plate-like) grew in the same drops after several weeks. Only the latter type diffracted to sufficient resolution for a structure determination.</p></sec><sec id="s3-8"><title>Structure determination</title><p>Diffraction data were collected at Diamond Light Source beamlines I02, I03, I04 and I04-1. Data were integrated in iMosflm (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Leslie and Powell, 2007</xref>) and scaled with Scala (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Collaborative Computational Project Number 4, 1994</xref>). For the minimal U1 snRNP (SmKCm complex) an initial molecular replacement solution was found in Phaser (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">McCoy et al., 2007</xref>) using the U4 snRNP core domain proteins (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Leung et al., 2011</xref>). These form similar ring structures in both U1 and U4 snRNP, and have a total mass of ∼70 kDa, which is more than half the mass of the minimal U1 snRNP (∼120 kDa). Phases were improved by density modification using Parrot (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Cowtan, 2010</xref>). This allowed us to build the remainder of the model using Coot (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Emsley et al., 2010</xref>). The N-terminal region of U1-70k was built de novo and we manually placed the zinc finger domain of U1-C protein (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Muto et al., 2004</xref>) and HIV1 kissing loop structure (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Ennifar et al., 2001</xref>) into electron density. The structure was refined by Refmac (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">Murshudov et al., 1997</xref>) (<xref ref-type="table" rid="tbl1">Table 1</xref>). For the U1A70kF-RNA complex, an initial molecular replacement solution was found in Phaser (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">McCoy et al., 2007</xref>) using part of the structure of U1-A complex with SL2 RNA (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">Oubridge et al., 1994</xref>) and a homology model of the U1-70k RRM, which was built with Modeller (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Mart-Renom et al., 2000</xref>) using multiple templates and manually refined alignment as an input. The remainder of the model was built into the MR map using Coot (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Emsley et al., 2010</xref>), and the structure was refined by Refmac (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">Murshudov et al., 1997</xref>) (<xref ref-type="table" rid="tbl1">Table 1</xref>).

All the components were diluted in binding assay buffer (BAB: 10 mM K<sup>+</sup>-Hepes pH7.5, 200 mM KCl, 2 mM MgCl<sub>2</sub>, 0.5 mM DTT, 100 µg/ml tRNA, 50 µg/ml BSA), and 1.5 µM U1-C protein was added to BAB to ensure saturation of U1 snRNP with U1-C protein under assay conditions. In competition assays, each reaction (16 μl) containing 1 nM fluorescein-labeled reference RNA oligo (5ss-F) and 35 nM U1 snRNP reconstituted with U1 + Ψ RNA (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s2">Figure 1—figure supplement 2</xref>), was titrated with non-labelled competitor 5′SS RNA oligos. Binding curves were measured by fluorescence polarization using Pherastar (BMG Labtech, Ortenberg, Germany). The assays were carried out in triplicate. The values of fluorescence polarization in the absence of competitor RNA oligo were plotted at 1 pM for reference.</p><p>In the filter-binding assay, a 5′SS RNA oligonucleotide (5′-<sup>32</sup>P- CAAAGGUAAGAUGGA-3′, 10 fmol), was mixed with various concentrations of U1 snRNP, with or without U1-C protein, in Filter-Binding Buffer (FBB: 200 mM KCl, 2 mM MgCl<sub>2</sub>, 0.5 mM DTT, 10 mM Hepes, pH 7.5, 100 µg/ml tRNA, 50 µg/ml BSA) in a final volume of 40 µl and incubated at 22°C for 2 hr. The binding reaction was passed, under vacuum, through a Schleicher &amp; Schuell (Dassel, Germany) NC45, 25 mm diameter filter that had been pre-wetted with FBB. The filter was washed with 0.5 ml FBB and then dried. The proportion of radiolabeled oligonucleotide retained on the filter was determined by scintillation counting. The experiment was performed in triplicate.</p></sec></sec></body><back><ack id="ack"><title>Acknowledgements</title><p>We thank our former colleagues, particularly Daniel Pomeranz Krummel, Christian Kambach, Tijana Ignjatovic, and Yutaka Muto, who contributed to the early stages of this project, Chris Johnson for his invaluable advice and help with RNA binding assays.

Your article has been favorably evaluated by James Manley (Senior editor) and 3 reviewers, one of whom is a member of our Board of Reviewing Editors.</p><p>The following individuals responsible for the peer review of your submission have agreed to reveal their identity: Timothy Nilsen (Reviewing editor); Elena Conti and Joan Steitz (peer reviewers).</p><p>The Reviewing editor and the other reviewers discussed their comments before we reached this decision, and the Reviewing editor has assembled the following comments to help you prepare a revised submission.</p><p>As you will see, two of the referees thought that the work was very nice and could be published as is. The third referee agrees that the work is very important and is worthy of publication in <italic>eLife</italic>. However they raise a number of points that must be dealt with via revision. Please address each of these points as thoroughly as possible. When revision is complete resubmit electronically together with a letter detailing all changes.</p><p><italic>Reviewer #1:</italic></p><p>This manuscript reports high resolution x-ray structures of two sub-domains of U1 snRNP. The two structures reveal unprecedented insight into the organization of the RNP as well as the mechanism by which this RNP recognizes 5' splice sites. Both structures contain a wealth of information regarding protein-protein interactions as well as protein-RNA interactions present in the RNP. Perhaps the most surprising aspect of the paper is that the U1-C protein does not make base specific contacts with the 5' splice site. This finding dispels the currently accepted notion that U1-C participates in 5' splice site recognition. Overall, the manuscript is exceptionally clearly presented and the results are highly significant. Publication in <italic>eLife</italic> is recommended as is.</p><p><italic>Reviewer #2</italic>:</p><p>The manuscript by Kondo et al. elucidates the mechanism of 5' splice site recognition. Based on their previous work, the authors cleverly engineered two subcomplexes of the human U1 snRNP and determined their corresponding structures at high resolution. The fundamental importance of this work is that the results explain how the 5' splice site of a pre-mRNA is recognized by the U1 snRNP. The work is thorough, the data are of high quality, the figures and text are clear, and the message is very important. This is a beautiful piece of work.</p><p><italic>Reviewer #3:</italic></p><p>Kondo et al used X-ray crystallography to solve two structures related to the human U1 snRNP. Their structural data conclusively show that the 5′ splice site is recognized via base pairing with U1 snRNA and not another protein in the snRNP complex. Furthermore, the structures establish a network of interactions within the U1 snRNP, particularly U1 snRNA, U1-C, U1-70k and the seven Sm proteins. The authors also employ binding assays to validate the importance of base pairing between U1 snRNA and RNA containing the 5′ splice site.</p><p>Overall, the work rests on a long-time controversy in the splicing field; whether the sequence of the 5'-splice site is recognized by both an RNA and a protein and is therefore worthy of publication in <italic>eLife</italic>. However, several scientific issues need to be addressed and the clarity of the presentation requires significant improvement.</p><p>Scientific comments:</p><p>1) Pre-mRNA binding assays: For oligo 5ss-F, the sequence does not appear to be a consensus 5'-splice site. Thus, the competing oligos have a consensus splice site but the sequence differs by more than a single-nucleotide position. The authors need to explain why these sequences were used or repeat the assay using oligos with the proper sequence.</p><p>2) The main text provides no details about how the crystal structures were determined, i.e. by molecular replacement. The rationale for using the U4 snRNP core domain as a model was not explained. Is it simply because the Sm proteins are shared?</p><p>General comments:</p><p>Interactions are described extensively throughout this manuscript. However, specific interactions (i.e. amino acid residues and nucleotides) are usually not stated. If specific interactions are mentioned, they often are not labeled in the figures, making it difficult to understand the authors' interpretation of the structure. More details need to be added to the figure legends to accurately and precisely describe the interactions shown in the figures.</p><p>Minor comments:</p><p>Abstract:</p><p>The resolution of the crystal structures (3.3 and 2.5 Ang) needs to be added. Also, “subdomains” is misleading because this term is not generally applied to the U1 snRNP. Perhaps the authors should use “synthetic substructures” instead.</p><p>Introduction:</p><p>The range of nucleotides in the invariant sequence is not mentioned. The authors should insert “(nts #-#)” to specify the nucleotides of interest?</p><p>The Introduction compares 5′SS recognition in yeast and humans. It appears the authors are trying to make the point that this work is focused on the conserved regions. To make this point more clear, perhaps the authors should begin by explaining how the yeast and human U1 snRNPs differ. Although “human” is used in the Title, the authors should reconfirm that all the components in this work are based on human nt sequences and proteins, correct?</p><p>The Introduction does not end with a short summary of the major findings of this work, leaving the reader unsatisfied. The last paragraph of the Introduction is a run-on paragraph. The authors should divide the paragraph into two independent paragraphs: one for the yeast-human comparison and one for the reported findings.</p><p>The Introduction talks about the role of U1 in splicing. However, there is no mention of its other important cellular function, telescripting.</p><p>Results:</p><p>The text mentions seven Sm proteins but <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1A</xref> labels only five Sm proteins.</p><p>“The overall structure of the core domain is very similar to that of the U4 snRNP core domain.” Please include rmsd to support the descriptor “very similar”. Also, how do you know the similarity is not due to model bias?</p><p>Helix H0 and helix H are two examples of features being mentioned that are not shown/labeled.</p><p>What are the “key residues”? The residues are also not identified in the figure legend. The reader must guess what residue is at the “equivalent position”. Where are loops L3 and L5?</p><p>The authors talk about nucleotides yet the exception they list, SmD1, is a protein. This is confusing.</p><p>Binding is stabilized by salt bridges and hydrogen bonds – what residues and/or nucleotides participate?</p><p>Because U4 is referred to several times throughout this manuscript, a picture of U4 should be shown in the supplement, explaining what components constitute the “core”.</p><p>The text specifically identifies strands and helices of importance but these secondary structures are not labeled in the figures (e.g. beta 4 strand in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3 fig4">Figure 3D and 4A</xref>). There are other such omissions throughout the manuscript.</p><p>Be quantitative about how much the R21Q mutation weakens binding.</p><p>Are pseudo-uridines present in both human and yeast snRNAs?</p><p>The “E complex” needs to be defined and its relevance explained for the general reader.</p><p>“Conserved well” <italic>–</italic> what exactly is the percentage of sequence similarity?</p><p>What is meant by the 11-nt loop effectively being a 5-nt loop? How does base stacking reduce loop length?</p><p>C33 and G34 are not labeled in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Fig 5A</xref>. In <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Fig 5c</xref>, the side chains of R191 and K138 should be shown?</p><p>The filter binding assay is not adequately described in Materials and methods.</p><p>Materials and methods:</p><p>1) Are all proteins and nt sequences based on human?</p><p>2) Prior to the induction step, were cells grown at 15<sup>°</sup>C?</p><p>3) What is the final storage buffer? Was glycerol not added?</p><p>4) No storage conditions are described. Was the protein never frozen?</p><p>5) Steps are described for annealing full-length U1 snRNA but it is not stated to what it is being annealed. Do the authors mean folding rather than annealing? Also, is the annealing step performed in the absence of buffer?</p><p>Figures &amp; legends:</p><p>The descriptions in the figure legends are inadequate. Many of the figures suffer from the same problems. Please explain what is represented by colored objects and dashed lines in each figure legend. The colors in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1–figure supplement 1</xref> are not consistent with <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1</xref> (e.g. SmF is brown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1</xref> but green in the supplement).

Perhaps the authors should use “synthetic substructures” instead</italic>.</p><p>The second sentence of the Abstract has been changed to “We present two crystal structures, at 2.5 Å and 3.3 Å resolution, of engineered U1 sub-structures which together reveal...” Although the term 'synthetic' was suggested to describe the sub-structures, we believe the term “engineered” already suffice to describe “something which was man-made”. Also, we now use the hyphenated term 'sub-structure', rather than 'substructure' throughout the text, because the latter only has the dictionary definition, 'an underlying or supporting structure', which is not the intended meaning.</p><p><italic>Introduction:</italic></p><p><italic>The range of nucleotides in the invariant sequence is not mentioned.

To make this point more clear, perhaps the authors should begin by explaining how the yeast and human U1 snRNPs differ.

However, despite these differences, the sequence of the 5'-single stranded region of U1 snRNA (nts 1-10) is invariant from yeast to human”.</p><p><italic>The Introduction does not end with a short summary of the major findings of this work, leaving the reader unsatisfied. The last paragraph of the Introduction is a run-on paragraph.

In particular, we find that U1-C makes no base-specific contacts with the 5'SS sequence. Also, by measuring the intrinsic affinity of recombinant U1 snRNP for various 5’SS sequences we disentangle the role played by the U1 snRNP from the other complexities of 5’SS recognition, and assess the relative contributions of U1 snRNA and U1-C protein in light of our crystal structure.”</p><p><italic>The Introduction talks about the role of U1 in splicing.
