To distinguish between self and non-self, T cells use their T cell receptors (TCRs) to recognize peptide-loaded major histocompatibility complex (MHC) molecules and respond to many types of antigens with an enormous TCR repertoire. T cells with a specific TCR are generated in the thymus through a series of processes, ranging from random rearrangement of TCR gene segments to selection processes that entail apoptosis of inappropriate cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Klein et al., 2014</xref>).</p><p>T cell development in the thymus is tightly regulated to prevent the generation of nonfunctional or self-reactive T cells. Progenitor cells from bone marrow (BM) become CD4<sup>-</sup>CD8<sup>-</sup> double-negative (DN) cells and undergo a process called β-selection, which selects only T cells with a functional TCRβ chain. DN cells that have passed β-selection then become CD4<sup>+</sup>CD8<sup>+</sup> double-positive (DP) cells and undergo positive selection, which selects T cells that bind to self-peptide ligands loaded onto MHC (self-pMHC) molecules. These CD4<sup>+</sup>CD8<sup>+</sup> DP cells then develop into CD4<sup>+</sup>CD8<sup>-</sup> single-positive (CD4<sup>+</sup> SP) or CD4<sup>-</sup>CD8<sup>+</sup> single-positive (CD8<sup>+</sup> SP) T cells. Negative selection, also known as clonal deletion, selectively removes T cells that bind with high affinity to self-pMHC during the DP and SP stages. Because the intensity and duration of TCR signaling based on TCR affinity to self-pMHC are the major determinants of selection (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Gascoigne et al., 2016</xref>), defects in the TCR signaling component lead to abnormal T cell development and alteration of the TCR repertoire (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Fu et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib40">Sakaguchi et al., 2003</xref>). Impairment of thymic selection caused by decreased TCR signaling destroys central tolerance, and consequently induces autoimmunity accompanied by the expansion of the CD44<sup>hi</sup>CD62L<sup>lo</sup> activated effector/memory T cell population (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Fu et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib40">Sakaguchi et al., 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib43">Sommers et al., 2002</xref>).</p><p>Capicua (CIC) is an evolutionarily conserved transcriptional repressor that regulates the receptor tyrosine kinase (RTK) signaling pathway in <italic>Drosophila</italic> and mammals (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Jiménez et al., 2000</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Jiménez et al., 2012</xref>). CIC is expressed in two different isoforms: long (CIC-L) and short (CIC-S), which differ in their amino termini (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Lee, 2020</xref>). CIC recognizes specific octameric DNA sequences (5ʹ-T(G/C)AATG(A/G)(A/G)–3ʹ) within its target gene promoter region and represses its expression (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Kawamura-Saito et al., 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib42">Shin and Hong, 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib48">Weissmann et al., 2018</xref>). Several genomic and transcriptomic analyses have identified CIC target genes, including <italic>ETV1</italic>, <italic>ETV4</italic>, <italic>ETV5</italic>, <italic>SPRY4</italic>, <italic>SPRED1</italic>, <italic>DUSP4</italic>, and DUSP6, in various cell types of cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Fryer et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib48">Weissmann et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib51">Yang et al., 2017</xref>). Activation of the RTK/RAS/MAPK signaling pathway phosphorylates and inactivates CIC via dissociation from target gene promoters, cytoplasmic translocation, and/or proteasomal degradation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Jiménez et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Keenan et al., 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Lee, 2020</xref>). CIC also mediates the ERK-DUSP6-negative feedback loop to maintain ERK activity within the physiological range in mammals (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">Ren et al., 2020</xref>).</p><p>We previously reported that murine CIC deficiency spontaneously induced lymphoproliferative autoimmune-like phenotypes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">Park et al., 2017</xref>). Hematopoietic lineage cell-specific (<italic>Vav1-Cre</italic>-mediated knockout) and T-cell-specific (<italic>Cd4-Cre</italic>-mediated knockout) <italic>Cic</italic>-null mice commonly exhibit autoimmune-like symptoms including hyperglobulinemia, increased serum anti-dsDNA antibody levels, and tissue infiltration of immune cells, accompanied by increased frequency of CD44<sup>hi</sup>CD62L<sup>lo</sup> T and follicular helper T (Tfh) cells in the spleen (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">Park et al., 2017</xref>). However, these phenotypes were more severe in <italic>Cic<sup>f/f</sup>;Vav1-Cre</italic> mice than in <italic>Cic<sup>f/f</sup>;Cd4-Cre</italic> mice. Moreover, enlargement of secondary lymphoid organs was observed in <italic>Cic<sup>f/f</sup>;Vav1-Cre</italic> mice but not in <italic>Cic<sup>f/f</sup>;Cd4-Cre</italic> mice (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">Park et al., 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">Park et al., 2017</xref>). These results indicate that deletion of <italic>Cic</italic> alleles in hematopoietic stem and progenitor cells leads to more severe peripheral T-cell hyperactivation and autoimmunity than the <italic>Cd4-Cre</italic>-mediated <italic>Cic</italic> deletion in CD4<sup>+</sup>CD8<sup>+</sup> DP thymocytes. We also reported enhanced peripheral T cell hyperactivation in <italic>Cic<sup>f/f</sup>;Vav1-Cre</italic> mice relative to <italic>Cic<sup>f/f</sup>;Cd4-Cre</italic> mice were caused by CIC deficiency in T cells rather than in other types of immune cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">Park et al., 2020</xref>), suggesting that this abnormality could be caused by impaired control of early thymic T cell development in <italic>Cic<sup>f/f</sup>;Vav1-Cre</italic> mice. It was reported that the frequency of CD4<sup>-</sup>CD8<sup>-</sup>CD44<sup>+</sup>CD25<sup>-</sup> DN1 cells was increased in adult stage-specific <italic>Cic-</italic>null mice (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib44">Tan et al., 2018</xref>). Taken together, these studies suggest that CIC plays a crucial role in thymic T cell development.</p><p>In this study, we found that CIC regulates thymic T cell development from the CD4<sup>-</sup>CD8<sup>-</sup> DN stage and positive and negative selection of thymocytes, primarily during the CD4<sup>+</sup>CD8<sup>+</sup> DP stage. TCR signaling was significantly attenuated in DP cells of <italic>Cic<sup>f/f</sup>;Vav1-Cre</italic> mice, thereby impairing both positive and negative selections in <italic>Cic<sup>f/f</sup>;Vav1-Cre</italic> mice. We also identified <italic>Spry4</italic>, <italic>Dusp4</italic>, <italic>Dusp6,</italic> and <italic>Spred1</italic> as CIC target genes that could potentially contribute to the reduced TCR signaling strength and impaired thymic selection processes in <italic>Cic<sup>f/f</sup>;Vav1-Cre</italic> mice. Our findings demonstrate that CIC is a critical regulator of TCR signaling in DP cells and thymic T cell development.</p></sec><sec id="s2" sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><sec id="s2-1"><title>Changes in the frequencies of thymic T cell subsets over development in <italic>Cic<sup>f/f</sup>;Vav1-Cre</italic> mice</title><p>To examine the role of CIC in thymic T cell development, we first evaluated the levels of CIC in multiple subsets of developing thymocytes using homozygous FLAG-tagged <italic>Cic</italic> knock-in (<italic>Cic<sup>FLAG/FLAG</sup></italic>) mice (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">Park et al., 2019</xref>). Flow cytometry for FLAG-CIC revealed that CIC levels were relatively high in CD4<sup>-</sup>CD8<sup>-</sup> DN and immature CD8<sup>+</sup> single positive (ISP) cells than in cells at later developmental stages, such as CD4<sup>+</sup>CD8<sup>+</sup> DP and CD4<sup>+</sup> or CD8<sup>+</sup> SP subsets (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1A</xref>). We then determined the frequency and number of thymic T cell subsets in <italic>Cic<sup>f/f</sup></italic> (WT), <italic>Cic<sup>f/f</sup>;Cd4-Cre,</italic> and <italic>Cic<sup>f/f</sup>;Vav1-Cre</italic> mice at 7 weeks of age.

However, T cell development during the DN stage was abnormal in <italic>Cic<sup>f/f</sup>;Vav1-Cre</italic> mice, as evidenced by an increased frequency of CD44<sup>hi</sup>CD25<sup>hi</sup> DN2 and CD44<sup>lo</sup>CD25<sup>hi</sup> DN3 subsets at the expense of the CD44<sup>lo</sup>CD25<sup>lo</sup> DN4 subset (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1C</xref>).

However, the decreased DN4 cell population did not prevent the formation of thymic DP cells in <italic>Cic<sup>f/f</sup>;Vav1-Cre</italic> mice. Thus, this defect was not sufficient to significantly affect the transition from the DN to DP stage of thymic T cell development in <italic>Cic<sup>f/f</sup>;Vav1-Cre</italic> mice. Interestingly, similar to <italic>Cic<sup>f/f</sup>;Vav1-Cre</italic> mice, ERK-deficient mice also exhibit a partial block in DN3-to-DN4 maturation without defects in maturation to the DP stage of development (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Fischer et al., 2005</xref>). Because TCR stimulation-induced ERK activation was markedly suppressed in CIC-deficient DP thymocytes (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5E and F</xref>), we inferred that the formation of the abnormal DN subset in the thymus of <italic>Cic<sup>f/f</sup>;Vav1-Cre</italic> mice was, at least in part, caused by reduced ERK activity in DN cells deficient in CIC. Consistent with this inference, the <italic>Spry4</italic>, <italic>Dusp4</italic>, <italic>Dusp6,</italic> and <italic>Spred1</italic> genes, involved in the inhibition of ERK activation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Kidger and Keyse, 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib41">Sasaki et al., 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib46">Wakioka et al., 2001</xref>), were significantly derepressed in CIC-deficient DN cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7B</xref>). Further study on how CIC controls pre-TCR signaling is critical to better understand CIC regulation of thymic T cell development during the DN stage.</p><p>Our previous study showed that the frequency of thymic CD4<sup>+</sup> and CD8<sup>+</sup> SP cells was comparable between WT and <italic>Cic<sup>f/f</sup>;Vav1-Cre</italic> mice at 9 weeks of age (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">Park et al., 2017</xref>). However, thymic T cell subset analysis at a younger age revealed a significant decrease in the frequency of SP thymocytes in <italic>Cic<sup>f/f</sup>;Vav1-Cre</italic> mice (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1D and E</xref>). This phenotypic change was not due to the enhanced accumulation of circulating peripheral T cells in the thymus of <italic>Cic<sup>f/f</sup>;Vav1-Cre</italic> mice at 9 weeks of age (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s3">Figure 1—figure supplement 3B</xref>). This difference could be explained by the differential effects of positive and negative selection on the formation of SP thymocytes during ontogeny. It is known that negative selection is inefficient early in ontogeny and becomes more efficient with age (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">He et al., 2013</xref>), implying that the process of positive selection might predominantly determine the size of the thymic SP cell population during neonatal life. Since <italic>Cic<sup>f/f</sup>;Vav1-Cre</italic> mice display defects in both positive and negative selection, it is conceivable that the decreased frequency of SP thymocytes in 1-week-old <italic>Cic<sup>f/f</sup>;Vav1-Cre</italic> mice were caused by a defect in positive selection, which was attenuated by ineffective negative selection at 7 weeks of age or older.</p><p>CIC deficiency, especially in DP thymocytes, disrupts the positive and negative selection of thymocytes, as evidenced by the impaired thymic selection process in <italic>Cic<sup>f/f</sup>;Vav1-Cre</italic> mice but not in <italic>Cic<sup>f/f</sup>;Cd4-Cre</italic> mice, which express significant amounts of CIC proteins in DP thymocytes. Moreover, CIC loss substantially suppressed TCR signaling in DP thymocytes, but not in SP cells. Although <italic>Spry4</italic>, <italic>Dusp4</italic>, <italic>Dusp6,</italic> and <italic>Spred1</italic> were all significantly derepressed in SP and DP cells from <italic>Cic<sup>f/f</sup>;Vav1-Cre</italic> mice, among these four CIC target genes, <italic>Spry4</italic> and <italic>Dusp6</italic> were more dramatically derepressed in DP cells than in SP cells in the absence of CIC (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7B</xref>). These results suggest that <italic>Spry4</italic> and <italic>Dusp6</italic> may be CIC target genes primarily responsible for the CIC deficiency-mediated dysregulation of TCR signaling in DP cells and thymic selection processes. However, removal of the <italic>Spry4</italic> alleles only partially recovered the TCR signal intensity and positive selection, indicating that CIC regulates multiple target genes, including <italic>Spry4</italic>, to control TCR signaling and thymic T cell development. Notably, the hyperactivation of peripheral T cells and expansion of the Tfh cell population in <italic>Cic<sup>f/f</sup>;Vav1-Cre</italic> mice were also not rescued in <italic>Spry4<sup>-/-</sup>;Cic<sup>f/f</sup>;Vav1-Cre</italic> mice (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7s1">Figure 7—figure supplement 1C and D</xref>). These findings suggest that the partial recovery of the TCR signal intensity and positive selection process by loss of SPRY4 was insufficient to ameliorate the abnormal peripheral T cell phenotypes in <italic>Cic<sup>f/f</sup>;Vav1-Cre</italic> mice or that derepression of CIC target genes other than <italic>Spry4</italic> could lead to T cell hyperactivation and enhanced Tfh cell formation in <italic>Cic<sup>f/f</sup>;Vav1-Cre</italic> mice. Concordantly, we have shown that CIC deficiency promotes Tfh cell differentiation via <italic>Etv5</italic> repression (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">Park et al., 2017</xref>). In contrast, CIC deficiency-induced thymic T cell phenotypes were not rescued in <italic>Cic<sup>f/f</sup>;Etv5<sup>f/f</sup>;Vav1-Cre</italic> mice (data not shown). Overall, these findings suggest that CIC regulates various target genes with differential effects to broadly control thymic T cell development and peripheral T cell activation and differentiation.</p><p>This study provides insight into how CIC controls autoimmunity. Because defects in thymic selection lead to the breakdown of central tolerance (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib50">Xing and Hogquist, 2012</xref>), it is conceivable that CIC deficiency during thymic T cell development generates autoreactive T cells, inducing autoimmunity. Therefore, CIC potentially suppresses autoimmunity by controlling the thymic selection process, as well as Tfh cell differentiation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">Park et al., 2017</xref>). The more severe autoimmune-like phenotypes in <italic>Cic<sup>f/f</sup>;Vav1-Cre</italic> mice than in <italic>Cic<sup>f/f</sup>;Cd4-Cre</italic> mice (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">Park et al., 2017</xref>) highlight the significant contribution of the impaired thymic selection process to CIC deficiency-induced autoimmunity. To clarify the importance of each regulatory step in the suppression of autoimmunity, it will be necessary to better understand the molecular mechanisms underlying CIC regulation of thymic T cell development and Tfh cell differentiation. Additionally, studies on the role of CIC in T cell development and Tfh cell differentiation in humans should be conducted in the future to improve our understanding of the pathogenesis of autoimmune diseases such as systemic lupus erythematosus.</p></sec><sec id="s4" sec-type="materials|methods"><title>Materials and methods</title><table-wrap id="keyresource" position="anchor"><label>Key

The authors employ a conditional deletion of the Capicua (Cic) gene, a transcriptional repressor previously shown to be involved in regulating autoimmunity and follicular helper T (Tfh) cell differentiation, and now show that loss of CIC in hematopoietic cells leads to defects in TCR-β selection as well as in positive and negative selection of developing thymocytes.

Your article has been reviewed by 3 peer reviewers, including JC Zúñiga-Pflücker as the Reviewing Editor and Reviewer #1, and the evaluation has been overseen by Tadatsugu Taniguchi as the Senior Editor.</p><p>The reviewers have discussed their reviews with one another, and the Reviewing Editor has drafted this to help you prepare a revised submission.</p><p>Essential revisions:</p><p>1) The main shared concerns were about how the data is presented and interpreted; additional information/discussion is required to fully appreciate the quality and appropriateness of the conclusions. The discussion disproportionately focuses on potential defects in beta-selection and thymic Treg differentiation that were only superficially studied in this manuscript. At this stage, perhaps the interpretation of these results should be tempered.</p><p>2) Please address the recommendations to the authors listed below by the reviewers, with an emphasis on Ref #3 concerns, as well as the corrected highlighted by Ref #2.</p><p><italic>Reviewer #1 (Recommendations for the authors):</italic></p><p>1. The main conclusion is that TCR signaling strength is affected by the increased expression of antagonists of the ERK/MAPK signaling pathway, as well as calcium, which are clearly supported by the observations shown. One would also predict that γ/δ TCR signaling to be affected during development, and the authors should show whether gd T cell development or differentiation is also affected, in particular as it pertains to the preTCR vs gd-TCR checkpoint.</p><p>2. One surprising finding is that in the bone marrow chimera experiments, when using equal numbers of WT and Cic-deficient cells, that the thymocytes seem to have equal contributions of WT and Cic-deficient cells, as shown in Figure 6A. However, the actual frequencies of Wt vs Cic-/- cells are not shown and should be included. If these are similar, it would be curious given the defect in preTCR signaling , which typically accounts for a large number of downstream DP thymocytes. This should be further discussed in the text.</p><p><italic>Reviewer #2 (Recommendations for the authors):</italic></p><p>– Figure 1C: FACS plots are not representative of the graphs (seems like CD4-cre mice display an intermediate phenotype).</p><p>– Figure 1D has no legend.</p><p>– Figure 1D : FACS plot doesn't reflect the graphs (increased DP cell population in CD4-cre mice).</p><p>– Figure 1E: These results suggest that a portion of the SP thymocytes in older mice may be recirculating SP cells. The authors should do an analysis of SP thymocyte maturation (show TCRβ vs CD24 for example) to investigate this. Also, they should determine if the DN3/4 block is seen in young mice.</p><p>– Figure 2: Is CIC protein absent in DN1/2 thymocytes of Vav-cre mice?</p><p>– Figure 5 : It seems odd that Calcium flux is affected by CIC deletion and not PLCγ phosphorylation. Do the authors have a theory why?</p><p>– Figure 6 : To avoid transferring other immune cells like B and DC and answer the question the author are asking with this experiment, bone marrow cells must be lineage depleted before injection. Was this the case? (method section mention transfer of whole BM).</p><p>– pLCK model is interesting to discriminate impact of CIC deletion on DN cells from DP cells. Authors should describe this model and show if they recapitulate the DP/SP phenotype without the DN stages being affected.</p><p>– Since the authors base their explanation of the auto-immune phenotype on impaired thymocyte selection in the Vav-cre model, why is there no impact on thymocyte development but still signs of autoimmunity in CD4-cre mice, as mentioned in the previous paper? Authors should discuss these discrepancies.</p><p><italic>Reviewer #3 (Recommendations for the authors):</italic></p><p>1) Spry4 (and DUSP6) as a target responsible for much of the phenotype observed in CIC-deficient thymocytes is intriguing. However, it is not clear to this reviewer how the over-expression studies were performed. What is the efficiency of retroviral transduction in, presumably adult, thymocytes? Given nearly full suppression of p-ERK and calcium induction after activation in cells reported to be over-expressing Spry4 (or DUSP6), presumably the transduced cells were tracked – what marker was used?</p><p>2) There is a rather striking decrease in CD5 on DP cells on TCR transgenic CIC-deficient DP cells. Is this due solely to differences in the proportion of DP cells undergoing thymic selection (e.g. CD69+) or because of differences in the strength of signal itself? Indeed, differences in CD5 on polyclonal DP cells from Cicf/f;Vav1-Cre versus control DP are also quite striking. While the (presumably) post-selection DP cells expressing higher levels of CD5 seem to express similar levels of this molecule, the bulk population (presumably pre-selection) is significantly lower. What do the authors make of this? Are the majority of DP cells sensing no TCR stimulation at all? It seems as if this might be the case even with ex vivo stimulation; at least based on the provided histogram, a larger percentage of DP thymocytes appear to fail to upregulate Nur77 after in vitro stimulation while those cells that do upregulate Nur77 seem to do so similar levels whether CIC-deficient or control. Further, why is TCR signaling more impacted at the DP stage than at the SP stage in the absence of CIC?</p><p>3) There appear to be differences in the extent to which CIC impacts CD4<sup>+</sup> and CD8<sup>+</sup> SP thymocyte numbers at different stages of ontogeny. The authors imply that mature T cells that have recirculated to the thymus in adult mice (the 7 week old mice presented in this manuscript or as previously reported in 9 week old mice) may mask any striking differences in the relative proportions and numbers of CD4<sup>+</sup> and CD8<sup>+</sup> SP thymocytes in CIC-deficient as compared to control mice. In younger mice, there are significantly fewer mature thymocytes in the absence of CIC. Whether this is due to differences in the recirculated mature T cell population is less clear than implied; this could be due to differences in the selection processes that accompany T cell development at different stages of ontogeny. One would need to use appropriate markers (e.g. CD73) or reporters (Rag-GFP) to make this distinction.</p><p>4) Careful explanation of the experimental set up and conclusions from the TCR sequencing studies would be appreciated. I do not understand the argument for the longer CDR3 sequences in the CIC KO conventional CD4 T cell populations as being 'pre-selection-like'; what does this imply? It appears as if the main conclusion of the TCR sequencing data is that the differences in the repertoire predominantly lie in the Treg population; outside of TCR sequence analysis this subset is not analyzed in the current manuscript. Are there overt differences in thymic Treg development in the absence of CIC?</p><p>5) Gating strategies and representative flow plots, as well as clear descriptions of the gates in the figure legends, for all analyses would be appreciated. It is not always clear, for example, if lineage+ cells have been removed from DN gates, whether mature T cells have been gated on TCRbhi cells, whether the conventional CD4<sup>+</sup> SP population used for TCR sequencing includes CD25+ Treg progenitors, etc. In addition, representative histograms are not always provided for MFI analysis; this is important to understand, for example with the CIC-Flag tag, the extent to which expression is heterogenous in a population; clear statements about the population for which MFI is calculated (e.g. for Figure 4B, is the MFI calculated for the population in the positive gate or for the total population) should be added.</p><p>6) Consider splitting some of the data onto separate graphs (e.g. Figure 3C and D) as it is very difficult to appreciate the noted significant differences in terms of percentages and cell numbers when the symbols are against the x axis, for example.</p><p>7) Please revisit the appropriateness of the t test for assessing statistical significance across three mouse strains.</p><p>8) Please ensure that biological and experimental replicates are clearly noted for each experiment. For example, how many mice were used for the TCR sequencing experiments?</p><p>[Editors' note: further revisions were suggested prior to acceptance, as described below.]</p><p>Thank you for resubmitting your work entitled &quot;Regulation of positive and negative selection and TCR signaling during thymic T cell development by capicua&quot; for further consideration by <italic>eLife</italic>. Your revised article has been reviewed by 3 peer reviewers, one of whom is a member of our Board of Reviewing Editors, and the evaluation has been overseen by Tadatsugu Taniguchi as the Senior Editor.</p><p>The manuscript has been improved but there are some remaining issues that need to be addressed, as outlined below:</p><p>The remaining required revisions are clearly outlined within the detailed reviewers comments below.</p><p><italic>Reviewer #1 (Recommendations for the authors):</italic></p><p>The authors have comprehensively addressed most of my initial concerns, however additional points need to be clarified. In particular, the differences in pLck-cre vs Vav-cre mice should be better addressed more clearly.</p><p><italic>Reviewer #2 (Recommendations for the authors):</italic></p><p>The authors have provided satisfactory responses to points #1, 2, 3, 4, 5 and 7 but this reviewer still has a problem with the answer to comment #6: The authors claim that , as they expected, no defect was observed in DP/SP frequencies of CIC f/f pLCK-cre mice. However, in contrast to the CD4-cre model, CIC depletion seems complete in DP thymocytes of CIC f/f pLCK-cre mice (Figure S6). Do the authors have an explanation for why they don't observe the same DP/SP phenotype (defects) in the Vav-cre and pLCK-cre models?</p><p><italic>Reviewer #3 (Recommendations for the authors):</italic></p><p>I appreciate the author responses to previous questions and critiques; the manuscript is improved though some outstanding issues remain.</p><p>1. The integration of some of the new data is unconventional. Additional analysis (including supplemental figures) of Treg development in Cic cKO mice as well as mature T cell recirculation to the thymus appears to be added to the discussion rather than the Results section. Following this, the explanation for differences in the phenotypes of 1, 7, and 9 week-old mice based on the absence of a recirculated T cell phenotype in WT vs Cic cKO mice at 9 weeks is not clear to me.</p><p>2. The authors now make it clear that the TCR sequencing datasets are n=1. While their data interpretation is consistent with their hypothesis, I am concerned about making conclusions on this sample set.</p><p>3. Additional information is provided for the thymocyte transduction protocol and subsequent analysis; yet, ambiguities remain. It appears as if the thymocytes (from adult mice) were transduced in the absence of incubation with cytokines, and the transduction rate seems rather high for this population as described. Perhaps more details are needed. In addition, though the authors show a representative example of the GFP in a Supplementary file, given a BD Cytofix followed by cold methanol protocol is reported prior to p-ERK staining, I wonder about the extent to which GFP is preserved for this staining condition (these reagents have been reported quench fluorescence under some conditions and for at least some GFP variants).</p><p>4. Some gating strategies were clarified while others are still ambiguous to this reviewer. For example, in some cases CD8 SP analyses include pre-gating on TCRb+ cells. This does not seem to be the case in all figures, however. For example, for the quantification of CD8 SP cells in 4C, I wonder if these are ISPs and the interpretation of the results is skewed.</p></body></sub-article><sub-article article-type="reply" id="sa2"><front-stub><article-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.71769.sa2</article-id><title-group><article-title>Author response</article-title></title-group></front-stub><body><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Essential revisions:</p><p>1) The main shared concerns were about how the data is presented and interpreted; additional information/discussion is required to fully appreciate the quality and appropriateness of the conclusions.

Reviewer #3 also asked a similar question about the issue of recirculating SP cells (Reviewer #3’s comment no. 3). We examined the frequency of CD24<sup>lo</sup>CD73<sup>+</sup> recirculating CD4<sup>+</sup> SP cells in the thymus of WT and <italic>Cic<sup>f/f</sup>;Vav1-Cre</italic> mice at 9 weeks of age. The proportion of this cell population was comparable between WT and <italic>Cic<sup>f/f</sup>;Vav1-Cre</italic> mice, suggesting that the similar frequency of SP thymocytes in WT and <italic>Cic<sup>f/f</sup>;Vav1-Cre</italic> mice at 9 weeks of age did not result from an accumulation of higher numbers of recirculated peripheral SP cells in the thymus of <italic>Cic<sup>f/f</sup>;Vav1-Cre</italic> mice. The corresponding data are presented in Figure 1—figure supplement 3. We also included the interpretation of these data in the Discussion section (pages 17 and 18, lines 385-404). To address the second question, we examined the frequency of DN subsets in the thymus of 1-week-old mice. In agreement with results from 7-week-old mice, a partial block of the DN3-to-DN4 transition was observed in 1-week-old <italic>Cic<sup>f/f</sup>;Vav1-Cre</italic> mice.

We agree that transferring lineage-depleted BM cells is a standard way to generate BM chimeras. However, we believe that it is still valid to examine T cell-intrinsic functions of CIC in mice transferred with a 50:50 mixture of whole BM from WT and <italic>Cic<sup>f/f</sup>;Vav1-Cre</italic> mice, because WT and CIC-deficient hematopoietic stem and progenitor cells develop into T cell subsets within the same thymic environment.

In our previous study (Park et al., 2017), we showed that both <italic>Cic<sup>f/f</sup>;Vav1-Cre</italic> and <italic>Cic<sup>f/f</sup>;Cd4-Cre</italic> mice had a systemic autoimmune-like phenotype with expansion of the follicular helper T (Tfh) cell population and that derepression of <italic>Etv5</italic> promoted Tfh cell differentiation in CIC-deficient mice. Since excessive formation and/or hyperactivation of Tfh cells is closely associated with the onset of autoimmunity (Crotty, 2019), systemic autoimmunity in <italic>Cic<sup>f/f</sup>;Cd4-Cre</italic> mice could be attributed to the <italic>Etv5</italic> derepression-mediated promotion of Tfh cell differentiation. We found that CIC deficiency-induced autoimmune-like symptoms were significantly reduced in <italic>Cic<sup>f/f</sup>;Etv5<sup>f/f</sup>;Cd4-Cre</italic> mice (unpublished data), validating our previous conclusion. Our findings of defective thymic T cell development in <italic>Cic<sup>f/f</sup>;Vav1-Cre</italic> mice explain why <italic>Cic<sup>f/f</sup>;Vav1-Cre</italic> mice have a more severe autoimmune-like phenotype than <italic>Cic<sup>f/f</sup>;Cd4-Cre</italic> mice with normal thymic T cell development.

We have thus eliminated any ambiguities regarding the experimental procedure performed for analyzing retrovirus-transduced thymocytes. We infected thymocytes from adult WT mice with retrovirus co-expressing GFP and either SPRY4 or DUSP6, and subsequently analyzed the levels of phospho-ERK and calcium flux in GFP-positive DP cells. The virus infection efficiency was approximately 20%. We clarified this point in the corresponding figure legend and Supplementary file 4I (gating strategy for GFP-positive DP thymocytes).</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>2) There is a rather striking decrease in CD5 on DP cells on TCR transgenic CIC-deficient DP cells. Is this due solely to differences in the proportion of DP cells undergoing thymic selection (e.g. CD69+) or because of differences in the strength of signal itself? Indeed, differences in CD5 on polyclonal DP cells from Cicf/f;Vav1-Cre versus control DP are also quite striking. While the (presumably) post-selection DP cells expressing higher levels of CD5 seem to express similar levels of this molecule, the bulk population (presumably pre-selection) is significantly lower. What do the authors make of this? Are the majority of DP cells sensing no TCR stimulation at all? It seems as if this might be the case even with ex vivo stimulation; at least based on the provided histogram, a larger percentage of DP thymocytes appear to fail to upregulate Nur77 after in vitro stimulation while those cells that do upregulate Nur77 seem to do so similar levels whether CIC-deficient or control. Further, why is TCR signaling more impacted at the DP stage than at the SP stage in the absence of CIC?</p></disp-quote><p>Questions about:</p><p>1) CD5 levels in WT and CIC-deficient CD69<sup>-</sup> and CD69<sup>+</sup> DP cells:</p><p>To directly address the reviewer’s question, we examined the frequency of CD69<sup>-</sup> and CD69<sup>+</sup> DP cells in WT and CIC-deficient mice. We also compared CD5 levels in CD69<sup>-</sup> and CD69<sup>+</sup> DP cells between WT and CIC-deficient mice. As expected, the frequency of CD69<sup>+</sup> DP cells was lower in CIC-deficient mice than in WT mice (Figure 5B, Figure 5—figure supplement 1B and E). Importantly, a substantial decrease in CD5 levels was detected in CIC-deficient CD69<sup>-</sup> DP cells, but not in CD69<sup>+</sup> DP cells, compared to WT cells (Figure 5C, Figure 5—figure supplement 1C and F). As most DP cells were CD69<sup>-</sup> (more than 95% of total DP cells; Figure 5B, Figure 5—figure supplement 1B and E), decreased CD5 levels in CIC-deficient DP cells probably resulted from attenuated TCR signaling in DP cells rather than a decrease in the frequency of CD69<sup>+</sup> DP cells in CIC-deficient mice.</p><p>2) Histograms of Nur77 expression in DP thymocytes:</p><p>As the reviewer pointed out, Nur77 expression analysis in DP cells resulted in a two-peaked histogram (Figure 4B, Figure 7—figure supplement 1B). However, there was a difference between WT and CIC-deficient DP cells at the second peak representing an upregulation of Nur77 upon TCR stimulation (Figure 4B, Figure 7—figure supplement 1B). For Nur77 expression analysis, we treated thymocytes at 1×10<sup>7</sup> cells/ml with plate-coated anti-CD3 (5 μg/ml) and anti-CD28 (10 μg/ml) antibodies for 2 h to stimulate the TCR, followed by intracellular staining of Nur77. By conducting additional experiments, we found that the appearance of the two peaks depended on the experimental conditions used. We performed the same experiments using various concentrations of thymocytes. The appearance of two peaks was reproduced when thymocytes were employed at 1×10<sup>7</sup> cells/ml (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="sa2fig1">Author response image 1A</xref>). Interestingly, the first peak corresponding to the Nur77-negative DP cell population gradually disappeared as the concentration of thymocytes was reduced (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="sa2fig1">Author response image 1A</xref>). Therefore, we concluded that the histogram of Nur77 expression could be modified by the experimental conditions employed, such as concentrations of thymocytes, anti-CD3, and anti-CD28, as well as the incubation time taken. We would also like to mention that another research group using a method similar to ours obtained a similar histogram pattern for Nur77-expressing cells (Thien et al., 2010) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="sa2fig1">Author response image 1B</xref>).</p><fig id="sa2fig1" position="float"><label>Author response image 1.</label><caption><title>Histograms of Nur77 expression in double-positive (DP) thymocytes (A) Flow cytometric analysis of Nur77 expression in DP thymocytes.</title><p>Various concentrations of freshly isolated thymocytes were incubated with plate-coated anti-CD3 (5 μg/ml) and anti-CD28 (10 μg/ml) antibodies for 2 h, followed by staining of surface markers (CD4, CD8, and TCRβ) and intracellular staining of Nur77.

We believe that the qRT-PCR data presented in Figure 7B may partially explain this question. CIC deficiency more dramatically derepressed <italic>Spry4</italic> and <italic>Dusp6</italic>, CIC target genes responsible for inhibition of TCR signaling, in DP cells than in SP cells (Figure 7B), potentially affecting the TCR signaling pathway in DP cells more drastically than in SP cells. Moreover, our data showed that TCR signaling was weakly activated in DP cells compared to SP cells, when treated with the same concentration of anti-CD3 antibody (Figure 5A and D). In this regard, it can be inferred that the CIC deficiency-mediated derepression of CIC target genes may have had a significant inhibitory effect on TCR signaling in DP cells with weak activation of TCR signaling, but a negligible inhibitory effect on TCR signaling in SP cells with strongly activated TCR signaling. We have included this in the Discussion section (pages 18 and 19, lines 405-431).</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>3) There appear to be differences in the extent to which CIC impacts CD4<sup>+</sup> and CD8<sup>+</sup> SP thymocyte numbers at different stages of ontogeny. The authors imply that mature T cells that have recirculated to the thymus in adult mice (the 7 week old mice presented in this manuscript or as previously reported in 9 week old mice) may mask any striking differences in the relative proportions and numbers of CD4<sup>+</sup> and CD8<sup>+</sup> SP thymocytes in CIC-deficient as compared to control mice. In younger mice, there are significantly fewer mature thymocytes in the absence of CIC. Whether this is due to differences in the recirculated mature T cell population is less clear than implied; this could be due to differences in the selection processes that accompany T cell development at different stages of ontogeny. One would need to use appropriate markers (e.g. CD73) or reporters (Rag-GFP) to make this distinction.</p></disp-quote><p>We thank the reviewer for this valuable suggestion. Accordingly, we analyzed the frequency of recirculated mature CD4<sup>+</sup> T cells in the thymus of WT and <italic>Cic<sup>f/f</sup>;Vav1-Cre</italic> mice at 9 weeks of age using CD73 as a recirculating T cell marker. Unexpectedly, the frequency of thymic CD24<sup>lo</sup>CD73<sup>+</sup>CD4<sup>+</sup> SP cells was comparable between WT and <italic>Cic<sup>f/f</sup>;Vav1-Cre</italic> mice (Figure 1—figure supplement 3). Thereafter, we seriously considered the reviewer’s comment that the decreased thymic SP cell population in 1-week-old <italic>Cic<sup>f/f</sup>;Vav1-Cre</italic> mice could have resulted from differences in the selection processes that accompany T cell development at different stages of ontogeny. Based on a detailed research of the literature, we realized that negative selection is inefficient early in ontogeny and increases with age (He et al., 2013; Huseby et al., 2001). Since <italic>Cic<sup>f/f</sup>;Vav1-Cre</italic> mice have defects in both positive and negative selection, it is conceivable that the decreased frequency of SP thymocytes in 1-week-old <italic>Cic<sup>f/f</sup>;Vav1-Cre</italic> mice was caused by a defect in positive selection, and that this effect was attenuated by ineffective negative selection at 7 weeks of age or older. We discuss this interesting and reasonable possibility in the Discussion section (pages 17 and 18, lines 385-404).</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>4) Careful explanation of the experimental set up and conclusions from the TCR sequencing studies would be appreciated. I do not understand the argument for the longer CDR3 sequences in the CIC KO conventional CD4 T cell populations as being 'pre-selection-like'; what does this imply? It appears as if the main conclusion of the TCR sequencing data is that the differences in the repertoire predominantly lie in the Treg population; outside of TCR sequence analysis this subset is not analyzed in the current manuscript. Are there overt differences in thymic Treg development in the absence of CIC?</p></disp-quote><p>Previous studies have demonstrated that T cells with shorter CDR3 sequences are enriched in mature post-selection T cell populations (Hou et al., 2019; Lu et al., 2019). Based on this knowledge, we suggest that the increased frequency of longer CDR3 sequences in the TCR repertoires of CIC-deficient CD4<sup>+</sup> SP thymocytes might have been the result of defective selection processes. As suggested, we analyzed thymic Treg cell populations in 7-week-old WT and <italic>Cic<sup>f/f</sup>;Vav1-Cre</italic> mice. Consistent with a defect in negative selection in <italic>Cic<sup>f/f</sup>;Vav1-Cre</italic> mice, the frequency of thymic CD25<sup>+</sup>Foxp3<sup>+</sup> Treg and CD25<sup>-</sup>Foxp3<sup>lo</sup> progenitor cells was significantly increased in <italic>Cic<sup>f/f</sup>;Vav1-Cre</italic> mice. The corresponding data are presented in Figure 4—figure supplement 2 and are mentioned in the Discussion section (page 19, lines 440-441).</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>5) Gating strategies and representative flow plots, as well as clear descriptions of the gates in the figure legends, for all analyses would be appreciated. It is not always clear, for example, if lineage+ cells have been removed from DN gates, whether mature T cells have been gated on TCRbhi cells, whether the conventional CD4<sup>+</sup> SP population used for TCR sequencing includes CD25+ Treg progenitors, etc. In addition, representative histograms are not always provided for MFI analysis; this is important to understand, for example with the CIC-Flag tag, the extent to which expression is heterogenous in a population; clear statements about the population for which MFI is calculated (e.g. for Figure 4B, is the MFI calculated for the population in the positive gate or for the total population) should be added.</p></disp-quote><p>We appreciate this thoughtful suggestion. Accordingly, we provided gating strategies for all flow cytometry experiments in Supplementary file 4 and described the gates in the figure legends. We also show representative flow plots and histograms for all flow cytometry and MFI analyses, including histograms for CIC-FLAG expression in various thymic T cell subsets (Figure 1A). To answer some of the reviewer’s specific questions, we removed lineage<sup>+</sup> cells for all DN cell analyses, and excluded CD25<sup>+</sup> Treg progenitors from the conventional CD4<sup>+</sup> SP population for TCR repertoire analysis of non-Treg cells. We presented the graphs for Nur77-associated MFI for both total and Nur77<sup>+</sup> DP cells in Figure 4B and Figure 7—figure supplement 1B.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>6) Consider splitting some of the data onto separate graphs (e.g. Figure 3C and D) as it is very difficult to appreciate the noted significant differences in terms of percentages and cell numbers when the symbols are against the x axis, for example.</p></disp-quote><p>We thank the reviewer for this thoughtful suggestion. As suggested, the frequency and number of DN, DP, 4SP, and 8SP cells in Figure 3C, 3D, and 4C are displayed in separate graphs for reasons of clarity and comprehensibility.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>7) Please revisit the appropriateness of the t test for assessing statistical significance across three mouse strains.</p></disp-quote><p>Accordingly, we used one-way or two-way ANOVA with Tukey’s multiple comparison test for reanalyzing the statistical significance across three groups of mice or samples.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>8) Please ensure that biological and experimental replicates are clearly noted for each experiment. For example, how many mice were used for the TCR sequencing experiments?</p></disp-quote><p>As per the reviewer’s suggestion, we clearly indicated biological and experimental replicates for each experiment in the corresponding figure legends and/or method sections.</p><p>References:</p><p>Ayada, T., Taniguchi, K., Okamoto, F., Kato, R., Komune, S., Takaesu, G., and Yoshimura, A.

To more clearly explain the phenotypes of <italic>Cic<sup>f/f</sup>;</italic>p<italic>Lck-Cre</italic> mice in comparison with those of <italic>Cic<sup>f/f</sup>;Vav1-Cre</italic> mice, data were reorganized and the text in the corresponding Results section was amended accordingly (pages 13 and 14, lines 298-320).</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Reviewer #2 (Recommendations for the authors):</p><p>The authors have provided satisfactory responses to points #1, 2, 3, 4, 5 and 7 but this reviewer still has a problem with the answer to comment #6: The authors claim that , as they expected, no defect was observed in DP/SP frequencies of CIC f/f pLCK-cre mice. However, in contrast to the CD4-cre model, CIC depletion seems complete in DP thymocytes of CIC f/f pLCK-cre mice (Figure S6). Do the authors have an explanation for why they don't observe the same DP/SP phenotype (defects) in the Vav-cre and pLCK-cre models?</p></disp-quote><p>Thank you for raising this issue and apologies for how we carried out data analysis and interpretation. As described in the response to Reviewer #1’s comment, we quantified CIC levels in developing thymic T cell subsets from WT, <italic>Cic<sup>f/f</sup>;Cd4-Cre</italic>, <italic>Cic<sup>f/f</sup>;Vav1-Cre</italic>, and <italic>Cic<sup>f/f</sup>;</italic>p<italic>Lck-Cre</italic> mice (Figure 6—figure supplement 1A). Approximately 24% of CIC proteins were still expressed in DP cells from <italic>Cic<sup>f/f</sup>;</italic>p<italic>Lck-Cre</italic> mice compared to WT cells (Figure 6—figure supplement 1A), indicating incomplete depletion of CIC in DP cells of <italic>Cic<sup>f/f</sup>;</italic>p<italic>Lck-Cre</italic> mice. Similar to the findings in 7-week-old <italic>Cic<sup>f/f</sup>;Vav1-Cre</italic> mice (Figure 1D), a slight increase in the frequency of DN and DP thymocytes, and a decrease in the frequency of CD4<sup>+</sup> SP cells was observed in 7 week-old <italic>Cic<sup>f/f</sup>;</italic>p<italic>Lck-Cre</italic> mice (Figure 6—figure supplement 1C). It is worth noting that the DP/SP phenotypes were also mild in <italic>Cic<sup>f/f</sup>;Vav1-Cre</italic> mice at 7 weeks old when compared to WT mice (a significant but slight decrease in the frequency of CD4<sup>+</sup> SP thymocytes only) (Figure 1D). Therefore, it would be hard to expect that <italic>Cic<sup>f/f</sup>;</italic>p<italic>Lck-Cre</italic> mice will show significant changes in the frequency of DP and SP cells at 7 weeks old compared to WT mice because CIC depletion is incomplete in DP thymocytes of <italic>Cic<sup>f/f</sup>;</italic>p<italic>Lck-Cre</italic> mice. We rearranged the figure panels in Figure 6—figure supplement 1 and accordingly edited the text in the corresponding Results section (pages 13 and 14, lines 298-320) to make our conclusion clearer.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Reviewer #3 (Recommendations for the authors):</p><p>I appreciate the author responses to previous questions and critiques; the manuscript is improved though some outstanding issues remain.</p><p>1. The integration of some of the new data is unconventional. Additional analysis (including supplemental figures) of Treg development in Cic cKO mice as well as mature T cell recirculation to the thymus appears to be added to the discussion rather than the Results section. Following this, the explanation for differences in the phenotypes of 1, 7, and 9 week-old mice based on the absence of a recirculated T cell phenotype in WT vs Cic cKO mice at 9 weeks is not clear to me.</p></disp-quote><p>We appreciate this comment. Accordingly, we moved the data on the recirculating CD4<sup>+</sup> SP cells in the thymus to the Results section (page 7, lines 142-153). We also analyzed the frequency of recirculating thymic CD4<sup>+</sup> SP cells in 1-week-old WT and <italic>Cic<sup>f/f</sup>;Vav1-Cre</italic> mice and presented the data in Figure 1—figure supplement 3A. These modifications allowed us to more logically explain why we focused on the regulatory function of CIC in thymic T cell development.</p><p>The frequency and number of SP thymocytes were significantly decreased in <italic>Cic<sup>f/f</sup>;Vav1-Cre</italic> mice at 1 week old (Figure 1E), whereas these defects were attenuated and disappeared with age (Figure 1D) (Park et al., 2017). To determine whether the disappearance of the decrease in the frequency of SP thymocytes in <italic>Cic<sup>f/f</sup>;Vav1-Cre</italic> mice at 9 weeks old was due to increased accumulation of recirculating SP cells in the thymus of <italic>Cic<sup>f/f</sup>;Vav1-Cre</italic> mice compared to WT mice, we analyzed the frequency of recirculating CD24<sup>lo</sup>CD73<sup>+</sup>CD4<sup>+</sup> SP cells in the thymus of 9-week-old WT and <italic>Cic<sup>f/f</sup>;Vav1-Cre</italic> mice. The comparable frequency of thymic recirculating CD4<sup>+</sup> SP cells between 9-week-old WT and <italic>Cic<sup>f/f</sup>;Vav1-Cre</italic> mice (Figure 1—figure supplement 3B) suggests that the SP cell population recirculated into the thymus from the periphery was not the cause of the phenotypic changes in <italic>Cic<sup>f/f</sup>;Vav1-Cre</italic> mice with age.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>2. The authors now make it clear that the TCR sequencing datasets are n=1. While their data interpretation is consistent with their hypothesis, I am concerned about making conclusions on this sample set.</p></disp-quote><p>We appreciate your concern regarding the reliability of data obtained from only one sample set. To validate the TCR repertoire analysis results, we performed flow cytometric analysis of thymic CD4<sup>+</sup> non-Treg and Treg cells from WT and <italic>Cic<sup>f/f</sup>;Vav1-Cre</italic> mice using antibodies specific to various TCRβ V segments. To our surprise, the results were markedly different from our previous conclusions based on TCR repertoire sequencing analysis. Among the 10 different TCRβ V segments tested, the usage frequencies of eight TCRβ V segments in non-Treg cells were significantly different between WT and <italic>Cic<sup>f/f</sup>;Vav1-Cre</italic> mice, whereas only two TCRβ V segments were differentially used in the thymic Treg cell compartments of WT and <italic>Cic<sup>f/f</sup>;Vav1-Cre</italic> mice. The data are presented in Figure 4—figure supplement 2. Considering your concerns and these findings, we decided to exclude the TCR repertoire sequencing analysis data from the text. Accordingly, we revised the corresponding sections of the manuscript (page 11, lines 228-246). We believe that this decision does not affect the main conclusion of this study, and that the new data (Figure 4—figure supplement 2) still support our findings that CIC regulates thymic selection processes.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>3. Additional information is provided for the thymocyte transduction protocol and subsequent analysis; yet, ambiguities remain. It appears as if the thymocytes (from adult mice) were transduced in the absence of incubation with cytokines, and the transduction rate seems rather high for this population as described. Perhaps more details are needed. In addition, though the authors show a representative example of the GFP in a Supplementary file, given a BD Cytofix followed by cold methanol protocol is reported prior to p-ERK staining, I wonder about the extent to which GFP is preserved for this staining condition (these reagents have been reported quench fluorescence under some conditions and for at least some GFP variants).</p></disp-quote><p>As suggested, we have expounded on the procedures of retroviral transduction of thymocytes and subsequent analysis in the Methods section of the revised manuscript (pages 22-23, lines 511-513; page 24, lines 554-555; page 25, lines 579-583). As pointed out, thymocytes from adult C57/BL6 mice were transduced with retroviral supernatant and incubated for 48 h in the absence of additional cytokines.

Some gating strategies were clarified while others are still ambiguous to this reviewer. For example, in some cases CD8 SP analyses include pre-gating on TCRb+ cells. This does not seem to be the case in all figures, however. For example, for the quantification of CD8 SP cells in 4C, I wonder if these are ISPs and the interpretation of the results is skewed.</p></disp-quote><p>We appreciate this thoughtful comment.
