The initial polymerization process, called microtubule nucleation, occurs spontaneously via αβ-tubulin. Since a large energy barrier prevents microtubule nucleation in cells, the γ-tubulin ring complex is recruited to the centrosome to overcome the nucleation barrier. However, a considerable number of microtubules can polymerize independently of the centrosome in various cell types. Here, we present evidence that the minus-end-binding calmodulin-regulated spectrin-associated protein 2 (CAMSAP2) serves as a strong nucleator for microtubule formation by significantly reducing the nucleation barrier. CAMSAP2 co-condensates with αβ-tubulin via a phase separation process, producing plenty of nucleation intermediates. Microtubules then radiate from the co-condensates, resulting in aster-like structure formation. CAMSAP2 localizes at the co-condensates and decorates the radiating microtubule lattices to some extent. Taken together, these in vitro findings suggest that CAMSAP2 supports microtubule nucleation and growth by organizing a nucleation centre as well as by stabilizing microtubule intermediates and growing microtubules.</p></abstract><abstract abstract-type="executive-summary"><title>eLife digest</title><p>Cells are able to hold their shape thanks to tube-like structures called microtubules that are made of hundreds of tubulin proteins. Microtubules are responsible for maintaining the uneven distribution of molecules throughout the cell, a phenomenon known as polarity that allows cells to differentiate into different types with various roles.</p><p>A protein complex called the γ-tubulin ring complex (γ-TuRC) is necessary for microtubules to form. This protein helps bind the tubulin proteins together and stabilises microtubules. However, recent research has found that in highly polarized cells such as neurons, which have highly specialised regions, microtubules can form without γ-TuRC. Searching for the proteins that could be filling in for γ-TuRC in these cells some evidence has suggested that a group known as CAMSAPs may be involved, but it is not known how.</p><p>To characterize the role of CAMSAPs, Imasaki, Kikkawa et al. studied how one of these proteins, CAMSAP2, interacts with tubulins. To do this, they reconstituted both CAMSAP2 and tubulins using recombinant biotechnology and mixed them in solution. These experiments showed that CAMSAP2 can help form microtubules by bringing together their constituent proteins so that they can bind to each other more easily. Once microtubules start to form, CAMSAP2 continues to bind to them, stabilizing them and enabling them to grow to full size.</p><p>These results shed light on how polarity is established in cells such as neurons, muscle cells, and epithelial cells. Additionally, the ability to observe intermediate structures during microtubule formation can provide insights into the processes that these structures are involved in.</p></abstract><kwd-group

cilium and flagellum formation, and molecular motor trafficking (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Desai and Mitchison, 1997</xref>). α-tubulin and β-tubulin align head-to-tail to form protofilaments that associate laterally grow into the microtubules (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Alushin et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Nogales et al., 1999</xref>). The exposed β-tubulin end is called the plus-end, whereas the exposed α-tubulin end is called the minus-end. The microtubule plus-end is more dynamic than the minus-end; it dynamically alternates between growth and shrinkage. The dynamic events are regulated by many microtubule plus-end-tracking proteins (+TIPs) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Akhmanova and Steinmetz, 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Akhmanova and Steinmetz, 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Howard and Hyman, 2003</xref>). The minus-end is less dynamic and is responsible for determining the geometry of microtubule networks by stably anchoring at microtubule nucleation sites or the microtubule organizing centre (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Akhmanova and Steinmetz, 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Dammermann et al., 2003</xref>).</p><p>Despite the identification of many +TIPs, only a few minus-end-binding proteins (−TIPs) have been reported, including γ-tubulin and calmodulin-regulated spectrin-associated proteins (CAMSAPs). γ-Tubulin which forms a ring complex (γ-TuRC) is located at centrosomes to nucleate microtubules and stabilize the microtubule minus-ends (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Akhmanova and Steinmetz, 2015</xref>). γ-TuRC serves as a nucleation template for centrosomal microtubule formation by aligning αβ-tubulins to form the tubular structure of the microtubule in a process called templated nucleation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Moritz et al., 1995</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">Roostalu and Surrey, 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib56">Wieczorek et al., 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib61">Zheng et al., 1995</xref>).

Although several in vitro reconstitution experiments have shown differences among CAMSAPs, CAMSAPs generally bind to the growing microtubule minus-ends and strongly suppress the dynamicity of non-centrosomal microtubules in different cell types, including neurons and epithelial cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Chuang et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Hannak et al., 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Jiang et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Martin et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Nashchekin et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">Noordstra et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Pongrakhananon et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib41">Sampaio et al., 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib48">Tanaka et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib49">Toya et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib57">Wu et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib59">Yau et al., 2014</xref>). The minus-end side of the microtubule lattice, but not the very end, is recognized by the CKK domain, although some additional effects were detected by other regions of CAMSAPs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Atherton et al., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Atherton et al., 2017</xref>). CAMSAPs have been reported to act in parallel with γ-TuRC-dependent microtubule nucleation, and the microtubule-severing protein katanin regulates the functions of the CAMSAPs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Jiang et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib54">Wang et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib57">Wu et al., 2016</xref>). CAMSAPs are rapidly recruited to and to decorate pre-existing nascent microtubule minus-ends to sustain non-centrosomal microtubules. On the other hand, some reports have demonstrated the possibility that CAMSAP-containing foci are involved in promoting microtubule nucleation independently of γ-TuRC (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Atherton et al., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Jiang et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Nashchekin et al., 2016</xref>). Thus, the mechanism by which CAMSAP2 proteins contribute to non-centrosomal microtubule organization has remained controversial.</p><p>Recent studies suggest that microtubules in cells often nucleate independently of the γ-TuRC template (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Hannak et al., 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">O’Toole et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib41">Sampaio et al., 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib50">Tsuchiya and Goshima, 2021</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib59">Yau et al., 2014</xref>). Therefore, we examined the roles of CAMSAPs in microtubule nucleation and microtubule network formation in vitro. In this study, we discovered the fundamental role of CAMSAP2 as a strong nucleator of microtubule formation from soluble αβ-tubulins. Our studies demonstrated that CAMSAP2 co-condenses with tubulins to stimulate spontaneous nucleation of microtubules without the γ-TuRC template. Many microtubule nucleation intermediates were observed inside the CAMSAP2-tubulin condensate during the early stages of microtubule polymerization. The CAMSAP2-tubulin condensate grows into the nucleation centre and mediates aster-like microtubule network formation in vitro, demonstrating the importance of CAMSAP2 in non-centrosomal, γ-tubulin-independent microtubule nucleation processes.</p></sec><sec id="s2" sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><sec id="s2-1"><title>Profiles of CAMSAP2 constructs used in in vitro assays</title><p>Initially, we examined the biochemical properties of the recombinant CAMSAP2 constructs used in this study by SDS-PAGE and size exclusion chromatography (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1A</xref>).

Previous reports have demonstrated that CAMSAPs are not only cytosolic but also concentrated at sub-cellular structures such as adherens junctions and cellular cortex through the interaction with some adapter proteins (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib49">Toya et al., 2016</xref>), and these CAMSAPs that are anchored to semi-solid structures sustained microtubule growth. We also observed the local condensates of intrinsic CAMSAP2 in HeLa cells before and during the polymerization of microtubules (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s1">Figure 4—figure supplement 1</xref>). We thus thought that the physical stabilization of CAMSAP2 might increase the efficiency of microtubule polymerization. To test this hypothesis, we physically fixed GFP-CAMSAP2-FL on the coverslip surface with the condition in which GFP-CAMSAP2-FL forms condensates (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3</xref>). Biotinylated GFP antibody was fixed on the coverslip through the streptavidin binding. Preformed GFP-CAMSAP2 condensates were then applied (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4D</xref>), followed by the addition of TMR-labelled tubulin, and visualized by TIRF microscopy. Tubulin was efficiently incorporated into the CAMSAP2 foci within 1 min, although polymerization of microtubules was rarely observed (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4E</xref>). We thought that microtubule polymerization from CAMSAP2 foci might require free CAMSAP2 in solution, and we supplemented 10–1000 nM of free GFP-CAMSAP2-FL (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4F</xref>). As a consequence, microtubule formation was induced from the CAMSAP2 foci. GFP-CAMSAP2-FL at a concentration of 50 nM in solution was sufficient for efficient microtubule polymerization from the foci, although higher concentrations of GFP-CAMSAP2-FL further increased the microtubule polymerization efficiency (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4G and H</xref>). Thus, when CAMSAP2 is physically fixed as observed in vivo, its concentration required for microtubule elongation could be reduced.</p><p>Next, we acquired time-lapse images of microtubules using GFP-CAMSAP2-FL and TMR-labelled tubulin by TIRF microscopy.

Contrastingly, tubulin in the presence of GFP-CAMSAP2-FL produced a dense Cam2-aster network as described above (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6D</xref>), which functions equivalent to CAMSAP2-FL. With GFP-CC1-CKK, the Cam2-aster network was similarly observed, although the condensates were smaller than those of GFP-CAMSAP2-FL (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6D</xref>).

The CKK domain only (GFP-CKK) or a deletion construct of the CKK domain (GFP-CAMSAP2 ∆CKK) at 1 µM yielded few microtubules nor Cam2-asters but produced clumps of tubulin oligomers, consistent with the previous report (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6s3">Figure 6—figure supplement 3</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Atherton et al., 2017</xref>).

We also tested the ability for microtubule nucleation and formation of the CC3 domain by generating the GFP-CAMSAP2 ∆CC3. GFP-CAMSAP2 ∆CC3 could nucleate microtubules but a fewer number of asters (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6D</xref>). The coiled-coil regions, at least the CC3 domain, thus seem to be required for microtubule polymerization and Cam2-aster formation.

Around the regions where numerous rings existed, the ends of microtubules or tubulin sheets often exhibited partially curved sheet-like structures characteristically observed for growing microtubules (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8s2">Figure 8—figure supplement 2D</xref>). We also note that fully curved ends often observed for depolymerizing microtubules were rarely observed.</p></sec></sec><sec id="s3" sec-type="discussion"><title>Discussion</title><p>We reported here that CAMSAP2 functions as a nucleator of microtubule formation from soluble αβ-tubulin dimers through forming condensates, at least in in vitro conditions. CAMSAP2 reduces the tubulin concentration required for microtubule polymerization from 20 µM to 1–2 µM, the values equivalent to the tubulin Cc<sub>MT polymerization</sub>. The acceleration of microtubule nucleation seems to be achieved by the efficient formation of microtubule polymerization intermediates at the inside of the CAMSAP2 condensates, explaining how CAMSAP2 serves as a nucleation centre.</p><p>The CASMAP2 forms condensates via LLPS, as it retains liquid-like fluidity and is reversible and sensitive to temperature and salt concentration. Notably, CAMSAP2 could form a condensate at concentrations close to a physiological concentration (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3D</xref>). When artificial CAMSAP2 foci are made, radial elongation of microtubules from the foci also occurs in its near-physiological concentrations of CAMSAP2 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4H</xref>). These results suggest that the LLPS-dependent formation of CAMSAP2 is likely to contribute to the microtubule nucleation not only in vitro but also at the physiological conditions of cells.</p><p>Microtubules radiate out from each CAMSAP2 condensate, forming a Cam2-aster. The Cam2-aster resembles the centrosomal aster in which γ-TuRC generates the templated nucleation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Moritz et al., 1995</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">Roostalu and Surrey, 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib56">Wieczorek et al., 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib61">Zheng et al., 1995</xref>). However, the molecular behaviours inside the Cam2-aster are entirely different from those in the centrosomal aster. Within the CAMSAP2 condensates, large numbers of tubulin rings and sheets are produced. Unlike the γ-TuRC in which γ-tubulins contact laterally to make the ring template, the rings observed inside the CAMSAP2 condensates are produced by the longitudinal growth of αβ-tubulin to form a protofilament ring. The fluorescence detection of CAMSAP2 verified its localization at the inside of the condensate. On the other hand, how CAMSAP2 binds to tubulin to produce tubulin rings and sheets remains elusive and is a subject for future study.</p><p>The CKK domain of CAMSAPs has been reported to bridge two tubulin dimers in neighbouring protofilaments (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Atherton et al., 2017</xref>). This binding pattern apparently does not support the single ring formation. The cryo-EM structure of the TPX-2-microtubule complex provides us with a possible insight into the mechanism for this process (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib60">Zhang et al., 2017</xref>). TPX-2 uses two elements, ridge and wedge, to stabilize the longitudinal and the lateral contacts of a microtubule. Given that CKK of CAMSAP2 stabilizes the lateral contacts to bridge two tubulin-dimers (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Atherton et al., 2017</xref>) and plenty of CAMSAP2 molecules gather in the condensate, multiple CAMSAP2 molecules could also connect tubulin-dimers longitudinally through multiple CKK domains. The future high-resolution structural study of the CAMSAP2-microtubule complex needs to test this hypothesis.</p><p>In the presence of CAMSAP2, the tubulin rings were produced on ice but without growing into microtubules. After warming to 37°C, tubulin sheets and microtubules increase gradually in and around the condensate. In inverse proportion to their increase, the number of rings decreased. Thus, CAMSAP2 is involved in a tubulin ring formation, and tubulins consisting of the rings might be used as a material for microtubule formation. However, we did not capture the scene where the tubulin ring is directly incorporated into sheets or microtubules. On the other hand, we observed many curved sheets with lower curvatures. Hence, microtubule growth in the condensate might be achieved by dynamic fluctuation among the rings, curved sheets, sheets, and microtubules. Tubulin rings could be produced by making longitudinal contacts between tubulin-dimers (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8">Figure 8E and F</xref>) or by destabilizing the sheet or microtubule. Actually, tubulin rings have long been thought to be microtubule depolymerization products (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Erickson and Stoffler, 1996</xref>). To determine the actual functions of tubulin rings observed in the present study, further high-resolution structural studies of the rings complexed with CAMSAP2 or high-speed imaging of microtubule intermediate formation will be necessary.</p><p>We propose a model of spontaneous nucleation mediated by CAMSAP2 based on our data (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig9">Figure 9</xref>). First, CAMSAP2 interacts with tubulins, inducing their longitudinal stack formation until they form protofilament rings. This step can occur on ice. Incubation at 37°C then induces co-condensation of CAMSAP2 and tubulins to stimulate the efficient formation of microtubule nucleation intermediates, forming a nucleation centre. Plenty of possible nucleation intermediates are produced inside the condensates, although how these nucleation intermediates grow into the critical nucleus for microtubule formation is still uncertain (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Erickson and Pantaloni, 1981</xref>). Many microtubules efficiently radiate outward using the nucleation intermediates from the nucleation centre, producing the Cam2-aster. In this stage, CAMSAP2 also decorates the microtubule lattice around the minus-end to induce efficient elongation of microtubules. Microtubules from neighbouring asters then join together and generate a microtubule meshwork among the Cam2-asters, finally building the cytoskeletal framework. In the current structural model, therefore, CAMSAP2 plays a dual role: producing a co-condensate of CAMSAP2 and tubulin to function as a microtubule-organizing centre and increasing the efficiency of microtubule polymerization through its binding to the growing microtubule lattice.</p><fig id="fig9" position="float"><label>Figure 9.</label><caption><title>Structural model of microtubule nucleation and Cam2-aster formation induced by calmodulin-regulated spectrin-associated protein 2 (CAMSAP2).</title><p>Structural model of tubulin nucleation, polymerization, and aster formation induced by CAMSAP2, as detailed in the main text.

Importantly, no γ-TuRC has been detected at these locations. Our in vitro data provide some insight into how CAMSAPs induce microtubule polymerization at the CAMSAP-containing structures. At 50 nM, which is nearly a physiological concentration of CAMSAP proteins in cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Liebermeister and Klipp, 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib58">Wühr et al., 2014</xref>), CAMSAP2 binds to the minus-ends of microtubules but does not induce microtubule polymerization in vitro (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Hendershott and Vale, 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Jiang et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figures 1C</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">3</xref>). However, we showed that in the presence of CAMSAP2 condensates fixed to the coverslip, the same concentration of CAMSAP2 could sufficiently induce microtubule polymerization from soluble tubulins in vitro (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4</xref>). Thus, to support microtubule polymerization from particular structures, both CAMSAP-containing foci and soluble CAMSAP appear to be required.</p><p>In vertebrate cells, CAMSAPs generally decorate a single microtubule at its minus-end, not inducing aster formation. Nevertheless, it has been shown that a cluster of Patronin radiates multiple microtubules simultaneously (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Nashchekin et al., 2016</xref>), as observed for the Cam2-asters described here, which suggests that Cam2-aster formation may not be a purely in vitro event. It is possible that excess clustering of CAMSAPs and tubulins is prohibited in vivo through unidentified physiological mechanisms, and CAMSAP-mediated enhancement of microtubule growth, the mechanisms of which were partly uncovered in this study, likely also works in vivo by forming a smaller or minimal unit of the CAMSAP/tubulin complex. Our findings of the interactions between CAMSAP2 and tubulins reported here using in vitro systems should provide deeper insights into our understanding of their molecular roles in non-centrosomal microtubule network formation in living cells.</p></sec><sec id="s4" sec-type="materials|methods"><title>Materials and methods</title><sec id="s4-1"><title>Tubulin preparation</title><p>Tubulin was purified from porcine brain tissue (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Castoldi and Popov, 2003</xref>).

Since full-length CAMSAP2 is unstable at 37°C without a binding partner such as tubulin, only the CAMSAP2 bound with tubulin was re-solubilized after on-ice incubation and appeared in the SDS-PAGE gel.</p></sec><sec id="s4-7"><title>Phase separation</title><p>To set buffer condition to be physiological salt concentration, PEM-GTP with 500 mM KCl was mixed with CAMSAP2 and 5× CAMSAP2 was prepared. 5× CAMSAP2 was diluted fivefold with KCl-free PEM-GTP, and immediately loaded into a flow chamber created by sticking slide glass and 18 × 24 mm cover glass with double-sided tape. The flow chamber was placed in the moist chamber with the facing droplet on the cover glass to be down and waited for 20 min, then imaged. Experimental condition was examined using OLYMPUS PROVIS AX80 (OLYMPUS) equipped with the Olympus DP70 (OLYMPUS). Phase separations were imaged by a confocal laser scanning microscope LSM700 (Zeiss). FIJI was used for data analysis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib43">Schindelin et al., 2012</xref>).</p><p>For examining salt concentration, CAMSAP2 concentration was fixed at 1 µM and the KCl concentration was changed from 0 to 500 mM. For examining CAMSAP2 concentration, the KCl concentration was fixed to 100 mM and the CAMSAP2 concentration was changed from 10 to 1000 nM. In both conditions, mixture was loaded into a flow chamber, waited for 20 min, then observed.</p><p>For fusion observation, the mixture was prepared in the similar protocol described above with different concentrations of CAMSAP2. CAMSAP2 was set to 4 µM and the salt concentration was set to 100 mM by combining 60 mM NaCl from CAMSAP2 purification buffer and 40 mM KCl for adjustment. In this experiment, observation was started right after CAMSAP2 containing solution was loaded into the flow chamber.

Sample was loaded into flow chamber, the region of interest (ROI) was set to the target droplet, bleached, observed for every 10 s, and measured for 15 min or more. In order to reduce the measurement error due to the drift or movement of the droplet, five set of pictures were combined to one. Each dataset was cropped with ROI in the same size and combined with ’Concatenate’, which is a function of FIJI. Next, ROIs were set in the bleached region, with non-bleached region as background, and the average fluorescence intensity was measured. The damage of bleaching due to the beam exposure at the time of data acquisition was corrected and graphed (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib52">Wachsmuth, 2014</xref>).</p><p>In the co-localization observation of CAMSAP2 and tubulin, unlabelled tubulin used was mixed with AFDye-labelled tubulin in 9:1 ratio. 5× mixture (5 µM CAMSAP2, 50 µM tubulin) was prepared in salt-free PEM-GTP, diluted fivefold using physiological buffer (PEM-GTP + 100 mM KCl) to be 1 µM CAMSAP2, 10 µM tubulin, 100 mM salt (20 mM NaCl in CAMSAP2 + 80 mM KCl), and loaded into the flow chamber.

What follows is the decision letter after the first round of review.]</p><p>Thank you for submitting your work entitled &quot;CAMSAP2 organizes a γ-tubulin-independent microtubule nucleation centre&quot; for consideration by <italic>eLife</italic>. Your article has been reviewed by 3 peer reviewers, one of whom is a member of our Board of Reviewing Editors, and the evaluation has been overseen a Senior Editor. The reviewers have opted to remain anonymous. We are sorry to say that, after consultation with the reviewers, we have decided that your work will not be considered further for publication by <italic>eLife</italic> at this stage.</p><p>The reviewers thought the topic of the manuscript is potentially interesting for <italic>eLife</italic> but that currently its impact is limited. The physiological significance is not so clear because rather high concentrations are used here, and the reviewers have identified a number of key issues that would strengthen the story significantly.</p><p><italic>Reviewer #1:</italic></p><p>Using light and electron microscopy imaging, Imasaki et al. provide evidence for a role of CAMSAP2 in microtubule nucleation in vitro. The authors show that CAMSAP2 can lower the critical tubulin concentration required for microtubule polymerization using pelleting assays. These experiments were done with high concentration (1uM) of CAMSAP. The authors then used a light microscopy assay to examine polymerization. At high CAMSAP2 concentrations, foci are formed in the presence of tublin which nucleate microtubule polymerization. The authors then find that artificial clustering of CAMSAP2 can support tubulin nucleation, but only in the presence of free CAMSAP. Importantly the concentration of free CAMSAP2 used in these experiments is close to physiological levels. These findings are of interest because previous reports suggest CAMSAPs are not nucleating factors.

The study extends previously published work that showed that the homolog CAMSAP3 stimulates microtubule nucleation in vitro (Roostalu et al., Cell, 2018). Here the authors investigate this nucleation activity in much more detail using a combination of fluorescence and electron microscopy-based in vitro assays. Main novelties are the observation that CAMSAP2 can co-condense with tubulin and form foci for microtubule outgrowth and that CAMSAP2 stimulates also the formation of tubulin rings and sheets that are interpreted as nucleation intermediates. This study is an initial biochemical characterization of the conditions that can lead to CAMSAP2-tubulin co-condensation and the stimulation of microtubule nucleation in vitro. The study provides interesting information for those interested in the mechanism of microtubule nucleation and raises the question of whether such a CAMSAP2 condensate-mediated nucleation mechanism is physiologically relevant.</p><p>Figure 2: Is all pelleted tubulin in the presence of CAMSAP2 pelleted, because it is in the form of microtubules? Or can tubulin precipitate with CAMSAP2 in co-condensates as tubulin rings and sheets? This is particularly important to answer for the lower tubulin concentrations to support the authors' claim that CAMSAP2 stimulates the nucleation of 'microtubules' at concentrations as low as 2 μm tubulin. Microscopy seems to be required to provide a clear answer.</p><p>Figure 3. The characterization of co-condensate formation appears preliminary: Does CAMSAP2 also condense by itself (in the absence of tubulin). Are condensates liquid droplets (i.e. can they fuse? how mobile are proteins inside (FRAP)?)? Under which conditions do condensates form (buffer, temperature)? A recent study reported that a C-terminal fragment of CAMSAP3 (similar to the CC1-CKK construct used here) promoted microtubule nucleation (Roostalu et al., Cell, 2018). Although the mechanism of promoting nucleation was not the focus of that work, there was no indication of CAMSAP condensation or formation of asters (in the absence of motors that could form asters in that study), instead microtubules appeared to nucleate individually and were randomly dispersed, even at very high CAMSAP3 concentrations.</p><p>Figure 3G. Why do patches of surface-immobilized CAMSAP3 form? Is the biotin functionalization of the surface patterned? For an unpatterned, homogeneously functionalized surface, one would expect a homogenous layer of CAMSAP3.</p><p>Figure 3I. Nucleation from patches seems inefficient. Only few microtubules are visible, in apparent contrast to the later observations made by cryo-EM. Please explain why the nucleation efficiency appears to be different in fluorescence microscopy and electron microscopy experiments.</p><p>Figure 4. It would be informative to also characterize the CAMSAP2 fragments by fluorescence microscopy, particularly as there seem to be differences between fluorescence and electron microscopy observations.</p><p>[Editors’ note: further revisions were suggested prior to acceptance, as described below.]</p><p>Thank you for resubmitting your work entitled &quot;CAMSAP2 organizes a <italic>γ</italic>-tubulin-independent microtubule nucleation centre through phase separation&quot; for further consideration by <italic>eLife</italic>.

It is preliminary to conclude from the gel filtration in Figure 1 that CAMSAP2 is a tetramer or oligomer given that its shape may deviate from spherical. SEC-MALS should be performed.</p><p>2. It is still not clear what's happening in the pelleting experiment in Figure 2: aren't condensates loaded with tubulin (or nucleation intermediates) expected to pellet? And if they then dissolve after resuspension of the pellet in the &quot;depolymerization&quot; step they will contribute to the detected signal that is interpreted as 'microtubule'. Similar: If there are indeed some other aggregates, why is it clear that they will (at least not in part) be dissolved? It seems preliminary to conclude from these experiments that &quot;microtubules&quot; were detected, and hence that CAMSAP lowers the cc for &quot;microtubule&quot; nucleation.</p><p>3. It's also not clear what happens in the surface immobilization experiment in Figure 4 which is quite critical to support the physiological significance of the study that is mostly performed at extremely high CAMSAP2 concentrations. Why are there CAMSAP2 patches on the surface in the absence of CAMSAP2 in solution. It seems that a biotin-PEG slide is (homogenously) coated with streptavidin and then CAMSAP is immobilized on this surface. This should lead to a homogenous CAMSAP signal in the absence of added CAMSAP in solution, and not to dots. If dots are present in this condition, it may indicate that CAMSAP has not been flowed out completely and that the concentration in solution is higher than thought (or that something else unexpected is happening). Independent of this concern, the experiment seems to indicate that locally increasing the CAMSAP concentration on the surface may promote condensation also at lower CAMSAP concentrations in solution. This might be physiologically relevant if indeed local patches of CAMSAP (whose presence is independent of the presence of microtubules) can be observed in cells.</p><p>4. It may also be useful to test if accumulation of tubulin in condensates can be demonstrated with tubulins labelled with fluorophores with different hydrophobicity/charge to exclude an artefact (of &quot;co-condensation&quot;) induced by the label.</p><p>The main question that this manuscript raises is if the observed effects at high CAMSAP concentrations are physiologically relevant. This largely depends on the interpretation of the surface experiment which should therefore be technically very convincing.</p></body></sub-article><sub-article article-type="reply" id="sa2"><front-stub><article-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.77365.sa2</article-id><title-group><article-title>Author response</article-title></title-group></front-stub><body><p>[Editors’ note: the authors resubmitted a revised version of the paper for consideration.

The authors show that CAMSAP2 can lower the critical tubulin concentration required for microtubule polymerization using pelleting assays. These experiments were done with high concentration (1uM) of CAMSAP. The authors then used a light microscopy assay to examine polymerization. At high CAMSAP2 concentrations, foci are formed in the presence of tublin which nucleate microtubule polymerization. The authors then find that artificial clustering of CAMSAP2 can support tubulin nucleation, but only in the presence of free CAMSAP. Importantly the concentration of free CAMSAP2 used in these experiments is close to physiological levels. These findings are of interest because previous reports suggest CAMSAPs are not nucleating factors.

Consistent with the results of the light microscopy experiments, both EM and pelleting assay experiments showed the aster formation from 250 nM (Figure 2D, 2E, Figure 5—figure supplement 2).

The other is to create microtubules from intermediates through CKK domains which undergo microtubule stabilization through the binding to the microtubule lattice (Atherton et al., Nat. Commun. 2019, Atherton et al., NSMB, 2017, and Figure 6—figure supplement 4B). “Tethered CAMSAP2” represents the former by increasing the local concentration of the CAMSAP2, and the “free CAMSAP2” represents the latter.

Consistent with the TIRF results (Figure 4C), the efficiency of nucleation and the frequency of microtubule formation were decreased in both assays. We also inserted a text as follows: “Microtubule polymerization was detected from 250 nM CAMSAP2 in PEM, and 500 nM CAMSAP2 in PEM + 100 mM KCl, albeit the polymerization efficiency considerably decreased by increasing the salt concentration (Figure 2D and E).” in page 10 lines 239-241.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>2) A concern that should be addressed was whether the 'condensates' observed by EM are resulting from an aggregation process under their specific in vitro conditions that has little relevance in cells.

In biochemistry, we found that the condensate could be pelleted down with tubulin at 37 ºC and re-solubilized by incubating the precipitated fraction on ice (Figure 2B-E). The LM assay confirmed that CAMSAP2 alone was found to produce droplet like condensates even at physiological concentrations. We observed the fusion between two condensates and the fluorescence recovery after photobleaching (FRAP), indicating that condensates have a liquid property (Figure 3). In the EM assay, CAMSAP2 alone was found to produce droplets (Figure 5A), and the early stage of condensate was filled with many rings, sheet-like structures, and short microtubules observed by negative staining (Figure 6—figure supplement 3, Figure 7) and Cryo-EM (Figure 8, Figure 8-supplement 2-3). We did not find aggregates nor a microtubule bundling in the early stage of condensate, as is often seen in MAPs (Figures 7A, 8A, 8—figure supplement 3).</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>3) Negative stain EM can produce many artefacts, including large aggregates, particularly when applying stain to high concentrations of background protein.

As this reviewer suggested, we performed a TIRF assay using the full-length, CC1-CKK, CC3-CKK, and CKK (Figure 6B). As a result, we observed condensate formation and radial microtubule elongation from the condensate in the former three constructs, but not in CKK (Figure 6B-C). The size of the condensate decreased in this order. These results are consistent with the negative stain assay (Figure 6D).

The gold labelling method presented in the initial manuscript could reproducibly incorporate the gold into the tubulin ring (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="sa2fig1">Author response image 1A-B</xref>). However, as this reviewer pointed out, to confirm whether the gold observed in the ring would actually represent CAMSAP2, we should observe CAMSAP2 with the stoichiometrically labelled gold. Therefore, we attempted to label gold specifically via His-tag as described in Guesdon et al. (Guesdon et al., Nat Cell Biol, 2016).</p><fig id="sa2fig1" position="float"><label>Author response image 1.</label><graphic mimetype="image" mime-subtype="tiff" xlink:href="elife-77365-sa2-fig1-v1.tif"/></fig><p>When we attached the gold to the N-terminus via His-tag of CAMSAP2, the gold-his-CAMSAP2 was easily aggregated; thus, we concluded it was difficult to use the strategy for labelling. When the gold was attached to the C-terminus, the CAMSAP2-his-Gold was relatively stable and dispersed when we observed it in negative stain EM. Therefore, we first promoted the polymerization of 10 µM tubulin in the presence of CAMSAP2-his before attaching the gold. Consequently, many rings (red arrows) and sheets (green with white outer frame arrows) were consistently observed 30 seconds later (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="sa2fig1">Author response image 1C</xref>). Next, gold was attached to the Cterminal His-tag of the CAMSAP2, and the polymerization of 10 µM tubulin was promoted in the same way. As a result, the formation of condensate-like structures with the accumulation of gold was observed (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="sa2fig1">Author response image 1D</xref> right panel). The gold bound to the microtubule lattice was infrequently observed (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="sa2fig1">Author response image 1D</xref>, the left panel). However, the accumulation of CAMSAP2-his-gold did not progress to the formation of tubulin-rings, sheets, or microtubules. It is probably due to the steric hindrance caused by gold, which inhibits the microtubule lattice formation. The result was the same with cryo-EM.</p><p>Therefore, we decided to withdraw the gold experiment from this paper. Instead, we have added the other important topic, the condensate (LLPS) formation (new section “CAMSAP2 recruits tubulins through LLPS” page 10~), to clarify the dual roles of CAMSAP2, the condensate formation with tubulins and the microtubule stabilization. A discussion about the CAMSAP2 location has been limited to what we knew from the fluorescence experiment, i.e., CAMSAP2 accumulates in the condensate, or it binds to the microtubules lattice during microtubule elongation.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>8) In figure 7 they move to use 3 μm CAMSAP2 and 30 μm tubulin.

This makes the results/structures observed hard to interpret.</p></disp-quote><p>Sample preparation for Cryo-EM usually requires about ten times higher concentration than negative staining. Therefore, we examined the series of tubulin concentrations to minimize the spontaneous polymerization from tubulin and also allow the observation by Cryo-EM, finally setting the concentration of tubulin at 30 µM and CAMSAP2 at 3 µM. In the revised manuscript, we have revised texts with new figures to confirm that no polymerized microtubule was observed under tubulin-only conditions (p.19, lines 436-443; Figure 5—figure supplement 3; p.30, lines 615619; Figure 8—figure supplement 2B).

From the condensation observation by EM, LM, and biochemical analyses, we found a strong correlation between the presence of CAMSAP2 and the generation of tubulin-rings and sheets in the condensate.

Main novelties are the observation that CAMSAP2 can co-condense with tubulin and form foci for microtubule outgrowth and that CAMSAP2 stimulates also the formation of tubulin rings and sheets that are interpreted as nucleation intermediates. This study is an initial biochemical characterization of the conditions that can lead to CAMSAP2-tubulin co-condensation and the stimulation of microtubule nucleation in vitro. The study provides interesting information for those interested in the mechanism of microtubule nucleation and raises the question of whether such a CAMSAP2 condensate-mediated nucleation mechanism is physiologically relevant.</p></disp-quote><p>First of all, we would like to thank this reviewer for his/her proper understanding of our manuscript and for the comments. We took these criticisms to heart and have substantially revised the manuscript.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Figure 2: Is all pelleted tubulin in the presence of CAMSAP2 pelleted, because it is in the form of microtubules? Or can tubulin precipitate with CAMSAP2 in co-condensates as tubulin rings and sheets? This is particularly important to answer for the lower tubulin concentrations to support the authors' claim that CAMSAP2 stimulates the nucleation of 'microtubules' at concentrations as low as 2 μm tubulin. Microscopy seems to be required to provide a clear answer.</p></disp-quote><p>We performed a microtubule polymerization from 2 µM tubulin with 1 µM CAMAP2, which is close to the minimum concentration on the pelleting assay, and observed by negative stain EM (Figure 5—figure supplement 2A<bold>)</bold>. Consequently, we could observe the Cam2-aster formation consisting of plenty of microtubules. Hence, we can conclude that CAMSAP2 stimulates the nucleation of 'microtubules' at concentrations as low as 2 μm tubulin.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Figure 3. The characterization of co-condensate formation appears preliminary: Does CAMSAP2 also condense by itself (in the absence of tubulin). Are condensates liquid droplets (i.e. can they fuse? how mobile are proteins inside (FRAP)?)? Under which conditions do condensates form (buffer, temperature)?</p></disp-quote><p>We sincerely appreciate this review’s point, which significantly strengthens our manuscript. We performed a series of experiments to characterize the condensate formation. As this reviewer expected, CAMSAP2 itself could form condensate through LLPS. CAMSAP2 condensates fuse and show liquid fluidity by FRAP (new Figure 3E and F). We have added a section “CAMSAP2 recruits tubulins through LLPS” to the manuscript from page 10.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>A recent study reported that a C-terminal fragment of CAMSAP3 (similar to the CC1-CKK construct used here) promoted microtubule nucleation (Roostalu et al., Cell, 2018). Although the mechanism of promoting nucleation was not the focus of that work, there was no indication of CAMSAP condensation or formation of asters (in the absence of motors that could form asters in that study), instead microtubules appeared to nucleate individually and were randomly dispersed, even at very high CAMSAP3 concentrations.</p></disp-quote><p>We cloned, expressed, and purified the full length CAMSAP3 and tested the ability of aster formation (Figure 5—figure supplement 1). Consequently, CAMSAP3 exhibits the ability to promote the microtubule aster formation, although the microtubule nucleation and growth seemed less efficient than CAMSAP2 (page. 18, lines 396-401).</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Figure 3G. Why do patches of surface-immobilized CAMSAP3 form? Is the biotin functionalization of the surface patterned? For an unpatterned, homogeneously functionalized surface, one would expect a homogenous layer of CAMSAP3.</p></disp-quote><p>We sometimes see this phenomenon. We use an unpatterned homogeneous surface. The striped pattern might be created by the physical flow because PLL-PEG-biotin, anti-GFP antibody and GFP-CAMSAP are flowed into the flow chamber. We think this is not related to the property of CAMSAP2.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Figure 3I. Nucleation from patches seems inefficient. Only few microtubules are visible, in apparent contrast to the later observations made by cryo-EM. Please explain why the nucleation efficiency appears to be different in fluorescence microscopy and electron microscopy experiments.</p></disp-quote><p>We performed the TIRF experiment in the physiological buffer consisting of PEM + 100 mM KCl. Therefore, we performed a pelleting assay (new Figure 2E) and EM analysis using the same buffer for comparison (Figure 5—figure supplement 2). As a result, both experiments consistently showed that Cam2-aster formation with the physiological buffer was inefficient compared to the PEM. It is why Figure 3I in the old manuscript (Figure 4I in the revised manuscript) showed inefficient nucleation, as this reviewer pointed out. We include these results in the revised manuscript (page 10, the paragraph starts from line 236 and page 19 lines 428-434).</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Figure 4. It would be informative to also characterize the CAMSAP2 fragments by fluorescence microscopy, particularly as there seem to be differences between fluorescence and electron microscopy observations.</p></disp-quote><p>We investigated the aster formation of the CAMSAP2 deletion constructs by TIRF assay (new Figure 6C). These results were consistent with the negative stain EM results (new Figure 6D).</p><p>[Editors’ note: what follows is the authors’ response to the second round of review.]</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>The manuscript has been improved but there are some remaining issues that need to be addressed, as outlined below:</p><p>Reviewer #1:</p><p>The revised manuscript is much improved and addresses previous reviewer comments concerning different conditions used in different in vitro assays. The use of electron microscopy provides useful insight into the steps underlying the nucleation pathway. I anticipate the study will stimulate a number of future experiments.</p></disp-quote><p>We thank this reviewer for the kind evaluation of our manuscript.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>I found the description of CAMSAP-2 truncations interesting, but Figure 6 difficult to follow. The authors choose different subsets of constructs for different panels. Please could they show the same constructs for each assay? Also, the text discusses the role of the CKK domain in stimulating MT nucleation (Figure 6- supplement 4), but this is not shown in the summary table in Figure 6A. I think it might be helpful to include this.</p></disp-quote><p>We apologize for the poor quality of our presentation. Along with this reviewer’s suggestion, the names of all constructs were written in a unified manner for clarity. Also, the CKK domain has been included in Figure 6A in the revised manuscript.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Reviewer #2:</p><p>The authors have made an effort to address a large number of critical comments which is to be commended. Some of the new data provide useful new information. Now the manuscript is rather long and could be streamlined. However, some of the experiments are still not to the standard one would like to see in eLife.</p><p>1. It is preliminary to conclude from the gel filtration in Figure 1 that CAMSAP2 is a tetramer or oligomer given that its shape may deviate from spherical. SEC-MALS should be performed.</p></disp-quote><p>We thank this reviewer for suggesting an essential experiment for protein quality evaluation. We performed an SEC-MALS experiment with an HPLC system (Agilent 1260 infinity), equipped with a DAWN HELEOS II 8+ (Wyatt Technology) MALS light scattering detector and Optilab rEX differential refractometer (Wyatt Technology) (also written in Materials and methods, Size-exclusion chromatography with multi-angle light scattering (SEC-MALS)). The sample was concentrated to the maximum concentration of the CAMSAP2-FL of 3 mg/ml, which could not be higher than this concentration. It is typical behavior for the large multi-domain proteins containing a long IDP region. A hundred microliters of protein, which is the best volume to get the high and sharp signal for the column in our experience, were applied to the Superose6 Increase 10/300 GL column and analysed. As a result, CAMSAP2-FL showed a size of 122 ± 1.1 kDa (Figure 1—figure supplement 1) and we judged CAMSAP2-FL as a monomer. We have also included a short discussion describing the possibility that plenty of CAMSAP2 monomers that gather in the condensate could connect two tubulin-dimers longitudinally through multiple CKK domains (pp. 21, lines 518-525).</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>2. It is still not clear what's happening in the pelleting experiment in Figure 2: aren't condensates loaded with tubulin (or nucleation intermediates) expected to pellet? And if they then dissolve after resuspension of the pellet in the &quot;depolymerization&quot; step they will contribute to the detected signal that is interpreted as 'microtubule'. Similar: If there are indeed some other aggregates, why is it clear that they will (at least not in part) be dissolved? It seems preliminary to conclude from these experiments that &quot;microtubules&quot; were detected, and hence that CAMSAP lowers the cc for &quot;microtubule&quot; nucleation.</p></disp-quote><p>We appreciate this suggestion. We agree with the point, and we re-wrote our manuscript carefully using the word 'microtubule' in this section.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>3. It's also not clear what happens in the surface immobilization experiment in Figure 4 which is quite critical to support the physiological significance of the study that is mostly performed at extremely high CAMSAP2 concentrations. Why are there CAMSAP2 patches on the surface in the absence of CAMSAP2 in solution. It seems that a biotin-PEG slide is (homogenously) coated with streptavidin and then CAMSAP is immobilized on this surface. This should lead to a homogenous CAMSAP signal in the absence of added CAMSAP in solution, and not to dots. If dots are present in this condition, it may indicate that CAMSAP has not been flowed out completely and that the concentration in solution is higher than thought (or that something else unexpected is happening).</p></disp-quote><p>We are sorry for the lack of experimental detail. Experimental detail is following (Figure 4D, 4F).</p><p>The coverslip was coated with PLL-PEG-Biotin, followed by the streptavidin coat. A biotin-labeled anti-GFP antibody was then incubated and fixed on the glass. After fixation, the excesses antibody was washed out, and 1 μm GFP-CAMSAP2-FL diluted in PEM supplemented with 100 mM KCl was loaded on the slide. After the incubation, GFP-CAMSAP2-FL solution was completely washed out. And finally, an observation buffer containing 10 μm tubulin and indicated concentrations of GFP-CAMSAP2-FL (0 – 1,000 nM) were loaded.</p><p>As this reviewer described, the streptavidin was homogeneously coated, shown by the GFP alone homogeneously distributed on the glass surface (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="sa2fig2">Author response image 2</xref>). In the case of CAMSAP2, however, 1 μm GFP-CAMSAP2-FL forms condensates in PEM–100 mM KCl solution (Figure 3B-D). Hence, GFP-CAMSAP2-FL forms condensates in solution before attaching to the glass surface through GFP antibodies. In other words, GFP-CAMSAP2-FL binds to the glass surface as a condensate so that we can see dotted signals of GFP-CAMSAP2-FL on the glass surface even in the absence of added CAMSAP in the solution. In addition, GFP-CAMSAP2-FL condensates on the glass surface are stable in the absence of free GFP-CAMSAP2-FL in solution for at least 30 min.</p><fig id="sa2fig2" position="float"><label>Author response image 2.</label><caption><title>GFP attached on the glass surface represents homogeneous signals, unlike GFP-CAMSAP2-FL.</title></caption><graphic mimetype="image" mime-subtype="tiff" xlink:href="elife-77365-sa2-fig2-v1.tif"/></fig><p>We added this explanation to avoid misleading readers (pp. 10, lines 245-254) and inserted detailed procedures to the method in the revised manuscript (pp. 44, lines 1299-1310).</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Independent of this concern, the experiment seems to indicate that locally increasing the CAMSAP concentration on the surface may promote condensation also at lower CAMSAP concentrations in solution. This might be physiologically relevant if indeed local patches of CAMSAP (whose presence is independent of the presence of microtubules) can be observed in cells.</p></disp-quote><p>We sincerely appreciate this suggestion. As observed in the new Figure4—figure supplement 1, we could detect the intrinsic CAMSAP patches in HeLa cells during the microtubule network formation (0-3 minutes incubation at 37 ºC after the nocodazole treatment). This result supports the physiological relevance of CAMSAP condensate in cells.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>4. It may also be useful to test if accumulation of tubulin in condensates can be demonstrated with tubulins labelled with fluorophores with different hydrophobicity/charge to exclude an artefact (of &quot;co-condensation&quot;) induced by the label.</p><p>The main question that this manuscript raises is if the observed effects at high CAMSAP concentrations are physiologically relevant. This largely depends on the interpretation of the surface experiment which should therefore be technically very convincing.</p></disp-quote><p>Thank you for this comment. We have examined both AFDye 594 (Figure 3) and tetramethylrhodamine (TMR) (Figure 4). It confirms that tubulin accumulation in condensates can be observed with tubulins labeled with fluorophores with different hydrophobicity/charges.</p><p>A previous study has shown that TMR has the lowest artefacts among the red fluorescent probes (Zanetti-Domingues et al., Plos One, 2013). A lot of studies have also used TMR-labelled tubulin for TIRF experiments. Therefore, we used TMR for the experiments in Figure 4 to achieve the high S/N with the lowest artefacts.</p></body></sub-article></article>
