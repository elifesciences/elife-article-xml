The mechanism of coupling between ion or electron transfer and proton translocation in this large protein family is unknown. Here, we present the structure of the Mrp complex from <italic>Anoxybacillus flavithermus</italic> solved by cryo-EM at 3.0 Å resolution. It is a dimer of seven-subunit protomers with 50 trans-membrane helices each. Surface charge distribution within each monomer is remarkably asymmetric, revealing probable proton and sodium translocation pathways. On the basis of the structure we propose a mechanism where the coupling between sodium and proton translocation is facilitated by a series of electrostatic interactions between a cation and key charged residues. This mechanism is likely to be applicable to the entire family of redox proton pumps, where electron transfer to substrates replaces cation movements.</p></abstract><kwd-group kwd-group-type="author-keywords"><kwd>anoxybacillus flavithermus</kwd><kwd>membrane transport</kwd><kwd>antiporter</kwd><kwd>respiratory complex I</kwd><kwd>proton pump</kwd></kwd-group><kwd-group kwd-group-type="research-organism"><title>Research organism</title><kwd>Other</kwd></kwd-group><funding-group><award-group id="fund1"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100001822</institution-id><institution>Austrian Academy of Sciences</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>DOC fellowship</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Steiner</surname><given-names>Julia</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><funding-statement>The funders had no role in study design, data collection and interpretation, or the decision to submit the work for publication.</funding-statement></funding-group><custom-meta-group><custom-meta specific-use="meta-only"><meta-name>Author impact statement</meta-name><meta-value>Structure of the Mrp antiporter, an ancestor of respiratory complex I, suggests a mechanism of coupling between cation and proton translocation, applicable to a large family of related membrane proteins.</meta-value></custom-meta></custom-meta-group></article-meta></front><body><sec id="s1" sec-type="intro"><title>Introduction</title><p>The Na<sup>+</sup>/H<sup>+</sup> antiporters are widely distributed secondary active transporters that use the proton motive force to efflux intracellular sodium ions (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Ito et al., 2017</xref>). Several protein families catalyse this reaction and are mostly encoded by a single gene, such as the NHE family in eukaryotes and the NhaA family in bacteria (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Krulwich et al., 2011</xref>). Mrp antiporters are unique as they usually consist of seven subunits (MrpABCDEFG) encoded in a single operon (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1a</xref>). Because of the operon’s distinctive properties, Mrp antiporters have been classified in a separate category, cation:proton antiporter-3 (CPA3), in the transporter classification system (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib42">Saier et al., 2016</xref>). They support intracellular pH homeostasis and Na<sup>+</sup> efflux in alkali- and halophilic microorganisms and are essential for their survival in challenging environments (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Hamamoto et al., 1994</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Ito et al., 1999</xref>). At high pH, the pH component of the proton motive force is inverted from normal, and so a substantial Δψ component (electric potential) is crucial to drive proton translocation into the cell (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Krulwich et al., 2011</xref>). Antiporters with roles in alkaline pH homeostasis must catalyse electrogenic antiport, in which the ratio of H<sup>+</sup> entering the cell in exchange for Na<sup>+</sup> moving out is unequal, enabling proton entry to be driven by the Δψ. For example, the stoichiometry for <italic>E. coli</italic> NhaA is 2H<sup>+</sup>/1Na<sup>+</sup> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib49">Taglicht et al., 1993</xref>). The exact value for Mrp has not been fully established experimentally due to challenges in purification of the intact complex (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">Morino et al., 2014</xref>) but is likely to be also about 2, consistent with its function (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Dzioba-Winogrodzki et al., 2009</xref>). This raises the question as to why a so much more complicated protein assembly is needed to catalyse a similar reaction. Since under the extreme environmental conditions Mrp is essential for cell survival and cannot be replaced by single subunit antiporters (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Cheng et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib53">Xu et al., 2018</xref>), one of the proposals is that the Mrp complex can support cell growth at very high pH due to its large surface area, where only a few available external protons can still be gathered for translocation into the cell (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Ito et al., 2017</xref>).</p><p>The largest two Mrp subunits, MrpA and MrpD, are homologous to each other, have 14 conserved trans-membrane (TM) helices, and are thought to participate in proton translocation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">Mathiesen and Hägerhäll, 2003</xref>). Their homologues (called antiporter-like subunits, which we will abbreviate to APLS) are found in many proton-pumping protein complexes where they are present in one to three (and recently discovered four [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Chadwick et al., 2018</xref>]) copies per complex, depending on the energy availability and needs of the organism (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Efremov and Sazanov, 2012</xref>). These include bacterial (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Baradaran et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Friedrich et al., 1995</xref>) and mitochondrial respiratory complex I (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Fiedorczuk et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib52">Walker, 1992</xref>), NDH (NADH dehydrogenase-like) complex from cyanobacteria (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Laughlin et al., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">Pan et al., 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib46">Schuller et al., 2019</xref>) and chloroplasts (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib43">Sazanov et al., 1998</xref>), Fpo (F420:methanophenazine oxidoreductase) complex from archaea (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Baumer et al., 2000</xref>) as well as various membrane-bound hydrogenases (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Efremov and Sazanov, 2012</xref>) including MBH (membrane-bound [NiFe]-hydrogenase) complex from archaea (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib54">Yu et al., 2018</xref>). These modern enzymes represent some of the largest membrane protein complexes known and are thought to have evolved from the unification of the membrane transporter Mrp-like module with the soluble NiFe-hydrogenase module, sometimes followed by the addition of an electron input module, such as the NAD-linked formate dehydrogenase in case of complex I (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Efremov and Sazanov, 2012</xref>). The Mrp complex thus represents an ancient ancestor of diverse protein families and is thought to have been among the few membrane proteins present in the last common ancestor of prokaryotes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib47">Sousa et al., 2016</xref>).</p><p>Structures of complex I (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Agip et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Baradaran et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Fiedorczuk et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib59">Zickermann et al., 2015</xref>), NDH (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib46">Schuller et al., 2019</xref>) and MBH (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib54">Yu et al., 2018</xref>) complexes have been solved recently. These enzymes consist of two main domains – the Mrp-like membrane domain, responsible for proton translocation (or sodium in case of MBH) and an attached hydrophilic redox domain, responsible for electron transfer between substrates (e.g. NADH to quinone in case of complex I). Therefore, the electron transfer and proton translocation processes are separated by large distances (up to 200 Å) and how they are coupled to each other remains a mystery. Upon solving the first structures of complex I, we proposed that redox reactions may drive proton translocation via long-range conformational changes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Baradaran et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Efremov and Sazanov, 2011</xref>). However, such changes have not been visualized till now despite significant efforts (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">Parey et al., 2018</xref>). Electrostatic interactions between the key charged residues have also been proposed to play an additional (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Efremov and Sazanov, 2011</xref>) or main (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Kaila, 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib51">Verkhovskaya and Bloch, 2013</xref>) role in the mechanism.</p><p>The structure of the universal common ancestor of these enzymes, the Mrp complex, has been lacking so far. Clearly, it would be instrumental in resolving the coupling mechanism, which should have common principles for this huge group of protein families. Furthermore, inactivation of the Mrp complex strongly reduces pathogenicity of such problematic human pathogens as <italic>S. aureus</italic> and <italic>P. aeruginosa</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Krulwich et al., 2011</xref>), presenting Mrp as a valuable drug target. To address these questions, we have determined the first, to our knowledge, atomic structure of the Mrp complex.</p></sec><sec id="s2" sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><sec id="s2-1"><title>Structure determination</title><p>The Mrp complex from <italic>Anoxybacillus flavithermus</italic> shows high sequence similarity to the well-characterised Mrp complexes from <italic>Bacillus</italic> sp (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s3">Figure 4—figure supplements 3</xref>–<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s4">4</xref>). The His-tagged Mrp complex from <italic>A. flavithermus</italic> was recombinantly expressed in the antiporter-deficient <italic>E. coli</italic> strain KNabc (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Goldberg et al., 1987</xref>). The complex showed high Na<sup>+</sup> (and to a lesser degree K<sup>+</sup>)/H<sup>+</sup> antiport activity and purified to high homogeneity, predominantly as a dimer (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1b,f–j</xref>). It showed higher apparent stability than the <italic>Bacillus</italic> complex (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">Morino et al., 2014</xref>). The protein tended to aggregate heavily in ice holes of cryo-EM grids. Therefore, we used grids coated with a very thin layer of continuous carbon, which resulted in a uniform particle distribution (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s2">Figure 1—figure supplement 2</xref>). However, the particles showed a strong preferred orientation, with the hydrophilic protein surface attached to the carbon. To compensate for the associated loss of information, data collection was performed with grids tilted (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib50">Tan et al., 2017</xref>) at 35°, resulting in excellent quality maps (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s2">Figure 1—figure supplements 2</xref>–<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s4">4</xref>). The initial dataset was collected with protein purified in n-Dodecyl β-D-maltoside (DDM) detergent. Particles appeared as dimers of only approximate C2 symmetry as the angle between monomers varied, resulting in several 3D classes differing by that angle. After symmetry expansion in C2 point group in Relion, resulting pseudo-monomer particles could be refined to 3.4 Å resolution (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s2">Figure 1—figure supplement 2</xref>). This allowed initial model building for most of the model, however, cryo-EM density at the edges of the monomer was fuzzy, with some TM helices (TMH) in the distal part of MrpA completely disordered. Therefore we purified the complex in a milder detergent Lauryl Maltose Neopentyl Glycol (LMNG) and collected a dataset again at 35° tilt. In this case dimers were overall ‘flatter’ than in DDM and possibly closer to their native shape in the flat lipid bilayer (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s3">Figure 1—figure supplement 3</xref>). Comparisons of cryo-EM maps of various dimers did not reveal any specific differences in the overall structure, apart from different apparent angles between the monomers. The best dimer class refined to 3.7 Å resolution (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1b</xref>), while the best pseudo-monomer (after symmetry expansion) class refined to 3.0 Å with excellent density in all areas including previously disordered edges (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1a</xref>). This allowed us to build and refine a high quality atomic model of the Mrp dimer (97% complete with only few terminal residues missing, <xref ref-type="table" rid="table1">Table 1</xref>, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="supp1">Supplementary file 1</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1c</xref>).</p><fig-group><fig id="fig1" position="float"><label>Figure 1.</label><caption><title>Overall structure of the Mrp complex.</title><p>(<bold>a</bold>) Cryo-EM density of a monomer, coloured by subunit as indicated.

MrpA braces the complex with the long amphipathic helix HL (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2d</xref>) extending from TMH15 to 16, similar to the arrangement in complex I. Among the three copies of APLS in complex I, MrpA is more homologous to the complex I subunit Nqo12/NuoL/ND5 (<italic>T. thermophilus</italic>/<italic>E. coli</italic>/mitochondrial nomenclature), while MrpD is closer to complex I Nqo14/NuoN/ND2 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s2">Figure 4—figure supplement 2b</xref>). Similarly to APLS in complex I (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Efremov and Sazanov, 2011</xref>), MrpA and MrpD contain N-terminal (TMH4-8) and C-terminal (TMH9-13) proton translocation half-channels that are related to each other by pseudosymmetry. Both half-channels contain lysine residues sitting on symmetry-related discontinuous (interrupted by a ~6 residue loop) helices (LysTMH7 and LysTMH12). These residues are likely the key to proton translocation because they are absolutely conserved, essential for activity and sit in a strategic position in the centre of each half-channel cavity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib44">Sazanov, 2015</xref>). Key LysTMH7 forms a pair with a conserved TMH5 glutamate (GluTMH5), which is thought to modulate the pK<sub>a</sub> of lysine (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Efremov and Sazanov, 2011</xref>). A central key lysine sits on another broken (by a π-bulge) helix TMH8 and connects the half-channels (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4a,b</xref>). As in complex I, these key residues are connected by additional polar residues and form a central hydrophilic axis running through the middle of the membrane across the entire complex (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4a,b</xref>). The flexibility provided by the broken helices may have a role in the conformational coupling mechanism and/or could help with pKa modulations of key residues.</p><fig-group><fig id="fig4" position="float"><label>Figure 4.</label><caption><title>Proton and cation translocation pathways.</title><p>(<bold>a, b</bold>) View from the cytoplasm (<bold>a</bold>) and side view (<bold>b</bold>) with key residues proposed to be involved in both pathways indicated.

Key E706 is replaced by Y59 in complex I, where this essential tyrosine sits on a π-bulge in TMH3 of Nqo10. This π-bulge can be wound up in mammalian complex I by a striking rotation of this helix, highly conserved in complex I and probably critical for its mechanism (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Agip et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Letts et al., 2019</xref>). The π-bulge in the corresponding helix is also present in the MBH complex (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib54">Yu et al., 2018</xref>). Interestingly, the bulge appears to be absent in the Mrp, so it may not be a universal feature or it is possible that it may appear in a different state of the complex, for example at high pH (current structure is solved at pH 6.0). Subunit MrpC fold is very similar to the complex I subunit Nqo11/NuoK/ND4L but instead of two histidines H37 and H40, conserved in Mrp, complex I has two essential glutamates (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s2">Figure 4—figure supplement 2b</xref>).</p><p>A striking feature of the Mrp complex is the tightly intertwined interface between the two monomers. To allow this, the two N-terminal TMH of MrpE (circled in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1c</xref>) have swung out from their respective positions in MBH (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3a</xref> top), resulting in extensive interactions between subunits MrpE and MrpB from both monomers. This shows that the Mrp complex clearly evolved to exist as a dimer in vivo, as also confirmed by the stability of the dimer contacts in all the 3D classes that we observe and the dimer stability during purification in several species (Materials and methods and <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">Morino et al., 2014</xref>). Another notable feature of the structure is a dramatic tilt of about 35<sup>o</sup> of all the TM helices in the small subunits, as compared to MrpA<sup>N</sup> and MrpD (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2d</xref>). Such an unusual fold is probably stabilised by the dimer architecture since the helices are tilted in opposite directions at the interface where two protomers meet (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1c</xref>).</p><p>Another striking feature is a very unusual surface distribution of hydrophobic lipid-exposed residues – starting at the edges of the dimer from the standard ~30 Å wide hydrophobic belt as needed to reside in the membrane, at the interface between the monomers the apparent belt thins to about 15–20 Å. This is obvious from both the hydrophobicity of surface residues and from the calculated surface charge distribution (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2a,b</xref>). Consistently, the detergent belt, visible in low-resolution maps (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s1">Figure 2—figure supplement 1h</xref>), gets very thin in this area. Overall the exposed hydrophobic belt is roughly linear (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2a</xref>), consistent with the flatness of lipid bilayer. This suggests that these dimers, with about 20 degrees apparent angle between the monomers, which refined to the highest resolution (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s3">Figure 1—figure supplement 3</xref>), are probably close to the physiological state of the complex.</p><p>The thinness of the dimer interface is mainly due to the two very short N-terminal TMHs of MrpE, of only about 15 residues each, which form the bulk of the interface, resulting in only ~20 Å total protein span across the membrane. These helices are continued in MrpE by a long amphipathic helix (AH, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2d</xref>), which likely resides at the surface of the membrane (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s1">Figure 2—figure supplement 1g</xref>). This helix is continued by a ferredoxin-fold domain of MrpE, which is exposed to the cytoplasm along with parts of TM helices of MrpG. A very thin hydrophobic belt is clearly unfavourable for membrane protein folding and so it must have a functional role in Mrp, most likely by acting to significantly disturb and thin a lipid membrane in this area. Such a thinning could be important for the shortening of the path along which Na<sup>+</sup> ions have to be moved across the membrane against the electric potential. The thinning of the membrane could be achieved by a combined action of the short MrpE TMH1-2 from both monomers (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1c</xref>) driving the long amphipathic helices of MrpE into the bilayer. The highly tilted helices of the small subunits could also help to achieve and sustain the thinning as they approach the dimer interface.</p><p>The surface charge distribution on the hydrophilic surface of Mrp is also very striking. On the cytoplasmic surface, the MrpA<sup>N</sup>/MrpD area is uniformly positively charged, while that of the small subunits is negatively charged (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2b</xref>). This pattern is completely reversed on the periplasmic side. This is very appropriate for the MrpA<sup>N</sup>/D subunits, which are likely to be involved in proton translocation, as negative charge in the periplasm will help the protein to gather protons that are scarce at high pH. On the other hand, positive charge on the inside surface of MrpA<sup>N</sup>/D will help to release translocated protons into the cytoplasm. The negatively charged area over the small subunits would be suitable for attraction of Na<sup>+</sup> or K<sup>+</sup> ions from the cytoplasm, while the positive charge on their periplasmic side is suitable for the release of translocated ions. This pattern is striking also for internal cavities – the MrpA<sup>N</sup>/D area has many small positively charged voids, while the area of the small subunits is full of negatively charged cavities, with some of them being quite large (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2c</xref>).</p><p>This strikingly bipartite pattern of charge distribution strongly suggests that MrpA<sup>N</sup>/D subunits are involved in proton translocation into the cell, while the entire domain encompassing MrpBCEFG and MrpA<sup>C</sup> is involved in sodium translocation in the opposite direction (as indicated in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2b,c</xref>). We discussed previously that sodium might be translocated at the interface between MrpA<sup>N</sup> and MrpD (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib44">Sazanov, 2015</xref>). However, the structure reveals that this interface is tightly sealed, hydrophobic and does not contain any suitable cavities, excluding it as a candidate for a Na<sup>+</sup>-binding site. Analysis of potential cavities and channels by the MOLEonline software (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib40">Pravda et al., 2018</xref>) revealed that most of the potential tunnels originate in two large neighbouring cavities found near the conserved H37<italic>c</italic> and H40<italic>c</italic> (we will indicate with italic suffix the subunit, in this case MrpC) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s1">Figure 4—figure supplement 1f</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2c,d</xref>). An additional cavity is found between MrpA<sup>C</sup> and MrpF subunits. This is also the largest cavity in Mrp and contains several bound lipids (modelled as phosphatidylethanolamine, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s1">Figure 4—figure supplement 1a</xref>) but the lipids do not fill the cavity entirely, leaving plenty of space. The cavity is present in both LMNG and DDM sample maps and in all types of dimers with different angles between monomers, confirming that it is not an artefact of a particular solubilisation condition or conformational state. We suggest that since the cavity is highly negatively charged (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2c</xref>) and lined with some polar residues (including Y684<italic>a</italic>, T707<italic>a</italic> and T72<italic>f</italic>), it could be used for passage and temporary storage of translocated cations (we will call it Na<sup>+</sup> cavity and it is indicated as such in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2c</xref> and as <italic>NaC</italic> in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4</xref>).</p><p>One of the prominent tunnels identified by MOLE (red in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2d</xref>) originates near H37<italic>c</italic>, passes by the key E706<italic>a</italic>, through the Na<sup>+</sup> cavity and then near the conserved D35<italic>f</italic> before exiting into the cytoplasm. It is negatively charged at the origin, as would be appropriate for Na<sup>+</sup>, but has some narrow passages of about 1 Å radius (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s1">Figure 4—figure supplement 1d</xref>), so the access must be regulated. Another tunnel (orange in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2d</xref>) originates in the cavity near H40<italic>c</italic>, which is also lined by the key E137<italic>d</italic> (GluTMH5) and continues towards the periplasm at the interface between MrpD and MrpC subunits (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s1">Figure 4—figure supplement 1e</xref>). Since H37<italic>c</italic> and H40<italic>c</italic> cavities are linked, these two tunnels can form a channel for Na<sup>+</sup> translocation across the membrane, with the passage through the narrow restrictions regulated as part of the coupling mechanism.</p></sec><sec id="s2-3"><title>Proton translocation pathways</title><p>A striking pattern of charge distribution and conservation of the fold and key residues between proton-pumping complex I and Mrp (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s2">Figure 4—figure supplement 2b</xref>) leaves no doubt that proton translocation channels are found in MrpA<sup>N</sup> and MrpD subunits, similarly to complex I and other related redox proton pumps. High local resolution (~2.9 Å) in the core of the structure allowed us to model many bound water molecules (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s1">Figure 2—figure supplement 1a,f</xref>). They are found mostly on the hydrophilic surfaces of the complex and along the entire central hydrophilic axis around key charged residues, confirming the previously suggested hydration of the central axis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Baradaran et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s1">Figure 4—figure supplement 1b</xref>). Since at 2.9 Å resolution we are still limited in the identification of water molecules, for the analysis of the complete proton translocation pathways we have modelled waters in Dowser (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib56">Zhang and Hermans, 1996</xref>; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4b</xref>). Many experimental and Dowser-predicted waters coincided, but some were identified only by Dowser. The analysis of connections between Grotthus-competent residues (K, H, E, D, T, S and Y [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Khaniya et al., 2020</xref>]) and waters (allowing for Grotthuss mechanism of proton transfer) revealed that the highly hydrated cluster near MrpA LysTMH12 (K432) and LysTMH8 (K279), containing also conserved H273, H369, and K377 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figures 3b</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">4b</xref>), is all interconnected and linked to the periplasm via the conserved E433. The link to the cytoplasm is most likely along H273, which sits on TMH8. The potential link is not continuous and must exist only temporarily during the catalytic cycle, allowing for protons to be ejected into the cytoplasm. Analyses of MrpA<sup>N</sup> and MrpD and comparisons with known complex I structures suggest that in APLS, links to the cytoplasm are achieved not along the centre of the N-terminal half-channel as discussed originally (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Efremov and Sazanov, 2011</xref>), but mostly along TMH8, which has more polar residues in the area. TMH8 is suited to play a functional role due to its π-bulge which is conserved in all APLS. The key LysTMH8 interacts with the backbone oxygen of the π-bulge and is the only protonatable residue on TMH8 in MrpD and MrpD-like subunits of complex I (Nqo13/NuoM/ND4 and Nqo14/NuoN/ND2), while in MrpA H273 is added to the π-bulge and only this histidine is conserved in Nqo12/NuoL/ND5, presumably replacing LysTMH8.</p><p>The area between LysTMH12 (K392) and LysTMH8 (K250) in MrpD is also highly hydrated and interlinked with participation of D333 and K337, which are replaced by one histidine in complex I Nqo13 and Nqo14 subunits (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3b</xref>). However, in contrast to MrpA<sup>N</sup>, LysTMH12<italic>d</italic> does not seem to be linked to the periplasm due to the lack of polar residues and waters (either experimental or Dowser-modelled) in this area. An analogous situation appears to exist in complex I, where only the MrpA-like subunit Nqo12/NuoL/ND5 is clearly linked to the periplasm in nearly identical to MrpA arrangement (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3b</xref>), while Nqo13 and Nqo14 apparently lack such links, as similar analysis shows. Therefore, it is possible that from the periplasm side all the protons enter the Mrp complex via MrpA<sup>N</sup> subunit (and leave complex I via Nqo12 subunit). In contrast, links to the cytoplasm along TMH8 could be functional in all APLS, although they are much more populated by polar residues in MrpA<sup>N</sup> and Nqo12 or Nqo13 compared to MrpD and Nqo14. There is a distinct possibility therefore that protons entering via MrpA<sup>N</sup> are re-distributed to MrpD via the abundantly hydrated central axis, as indicated in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4b</xref>, and entry from the periplasm via MrpD is questionable, as also indicated. In complex I, which normally works in the opposite direction, protons from the cytoplasm may be entering mainly via Nqo12 and Nqo13, get redistributed along the central axis and then pumped into the periplasm mainly via Nqo12. Although these new MrpA<sup>N</sup>-only-H<sup>+</sup>-in or Nqo12-only-H<sup>+</sup>-out models now appear to be more likely than the traditional view that each antiporter-like subunit carries one proton fully across the membrane (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Efremov and Sazanov, 2011</xref>), the distinction between the two models remains to be established in future experiments. It is, however, not important for the mechanism that we propose below, since the re-distribution of protons along the highly hydrated central axis is likely to be fast and not rate-limiting.</p><p>In this scenario the key LysTMH7/GluTMH5 pairs participate in the re-distribution of protons along the central axis but do not seem to play a large role in proton pathways, as those are formed from residues around LysTMH12 and LysTMH8. What is the role of these pairs then? The residues in Lys/Glu pairs are close enough to each other for strong electrostatic interactions but not close enough to form salt bridges, as they are separated by 6–7 Å. Since they are invariant and essential we propose that their main role is to regulate and control proton pathways via electrostatic interactions. The entire complex appears to be finely tuned electrostatically (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2b,c</xref>) and the pair is close enough to LysTMH8 (~10–15 Å) for changes in the LysTMH7 charge state to be able to change the pK<sub>a</sub> of LysTMH8. Additionally, MrpA GluTMH5 is only 7 Å away from MrpD LysTMH12 and so these two residues would influence each other’s pK<sub>a</sub>. Therefore, LysTMH7 and GluTMH5 from one APLS together with LysTMH12 from the neighbouring APLS probably represent coupling points in the mechanism, both in Mrp (circled in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4a,b</xref>) and in complex I. Charge switches in these points would control proton access to the periplasm via LysTMH12 (either directly or indirectly via proton re-distribution) and to the cytoplasm via electrostatic interactions with LysTMH8. A similar role for Lys/Glu pairs was suggested previously on the basis of MD simulations (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Di Luca et al., 2017</xref>). However, in the MD study the change in distance between lysine and glutamate was considered as a key ‘switch’, while we propose as a driving force a more robust, in our opinion, change in their protonation state.</p></sec><sec id="s2-4"><title>Cation (Na<sup>+</sup> or K<sup>+</sup>) translocation pathway</title><p>Our cryo-EM maps revealed strong cation density (stronger than waters) both in DDM and LMNG samples (Materials and methods, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s1">Figure 2—figure supplement 1e,f</xref>).

Histidines can coordinate both Na<sup>+</sup> and K<sup>+</sup> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib57">Zheng et al., 2008</xref>) and we assigned the cations as K<sup>+</sup> ions since we had K<sup>+</sup> in the buffer and the coordination pattern is consistent with K<sup>+</sup> (Materials and methods). It can be expected that Na<sup>+</sup> ions will bind in the same positions, with the coordination completed by the conserved S36<italic>c</italic>, S80<italic>c</italic>, N702<italic>a</italic> and several waters (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s1">Figure 4—figure supplement 1c</xref>).

Site-directed mutagenesis performed on Mrp complexes confirmed the essential role of the key APLS residues both for proton and cation translocation (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="supp1">Supplementary file 1</xref>). The essential role of MrpA<sup>C</sup> E706, D792 and E796 was confirmed in several species. Mutations in H719, coordinating the headgroup of the lipid bound in the Na<sup>+</sup> cavity, in P721, sitting at the end of the helix containing E706, in key E137<italic>d</italic>, the nearby F136<italic>d</italic>, and in P114<italic>e</italic> specifically affected K<sub>m</sub> for Na<sup>+</sup>, indicating a role for these residues in the Na<sup>+</sup> pathway.

This area at the tip of the monomer, where the membrane is likely to be thinned, is as highly conserved as the core of APLS, attesting to its functional importance (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s2">Figure 4—figure supplement 2a</xref>). It is also the most negatively charged area on the cytoplasmic surface (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2b</xref>) and is likely to represent the entry point for cations. Conserved D29<italic>f</italic> is one of the residues responsible for the negative charge here and its mutation to alanine completely abolished the activity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">Morino et al., 2010</xref>).</p><p>On the basis of these considerations and according to the analysis of cavities and tunnels by MOLE as described above, we propose that the Na<sup>+</sup> pathway (which applies also to K<sup>+</sup>) starts near H42<italic>g</italic>/H131<italic>e</italic>, passes by the highly conserved D35<italic>f</italic>, traverses the large Na<sup>+</sup> cavity between MrpF and MrpA<sup>C</sup>, passes by the key E706a and enters the double cavity where at least two cations, as we observe, can be coordinated between E706<italic>a</italic>, H37<italic>c</italic>, H40<italic>c</italic> and E137<italic>d</italic> (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4c</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s1">Figure 4—figure supplement 1c,f</xref>). The double cavity most likely represents a point of coupling between proton and cation translocation (circled in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4c</xref>), as here Na<sup>+</sup> ion(s) sit in a position analogous to the LysTMH12 in APLS coupling points. This way, the proton translocation through MrpD (already coupled to MrpA<sup>N</sup> via K248<italic>a</italic>/E167<italic>a</italic>/K392<italic>d</italic> coupling point) can directly be coupled to Na<sup>+</sup> translocation. The Na<sup>+</sup> path continues towards the periplasm at the interface between TMH5<italic>d</italic>, TMH3<italic>c</italic> and TMH21<italic>a</italic>, ending with the key E796<italic>a</italic> and D792<italic>a</italic> at the exit into the periplasm (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4c</xref>). T75<italic>c</italic> is facing E796<italic>a</italic> and is essential for growth in high salt (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="supp1">Supplementary file 1</xref>).</p><p>The role of conserved D35<italic>f</italic> was not clear from previous mutations in <italic>Bacillus subtilis</italic> Mrp, as substitutions were highly detrimental when the complex was expressed in <italic>E. coli</italic> (perhaps the assembly of the complex was affected) but not so in <italic>B. subtilis</italic> itself (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Kajiyama et al., 2009</xref>). However, in <italic>B. subtilis</italic> only conservative mutations to polar residues E and N were explored and so the effects could be expected to be mild. To clarify this, we generated mutants of <italic>A. flavithermus</italic> Mrp complex by mutating D35<italic>f</italic> to L, a hydrophobic residue of roughly similar size to D, and expressed the complex in <italic>E. coli</italic> similarly to WT Mrp. The mutation completely deactivated the complex as shown by the absence of growth at high NaCl concentrations (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1j</xref>). The dimer seemed to be de-stabilised as well, although the monomer was fully assembled (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1d,e</xref>). To try to clarify how important the dimer is for the function, we generated MrpE L41W and MrpG S72W mutants. They were chosen because there are no salt bridges linking the monomers but these residues form close contacts between the two monomers and we expected that an introduction of bulky tryptophanes may disrupt the dimer. This, however, did not happen and the activity was not affected (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1d,e,j</xref>). Therefore, the dimer can withstand some perturbations but it may not be absolutely essential for the mechanism per se, as a very similar fold exists as a monomer in MBH. The role of the Mrp dimer may have more to do with the stabilisation of the unfavourable membrane-thinning fold as discussed above. Nevertheless, our data suggests that invariably conserved D35<italic>f</italic> is important for activity, consistent with its position on the Na<sup>+</sup> path (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4c</xref>). Furthermore, this aspartate is found right opposite the invariable and essential for activity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">Morino et al., 2010</xref>) P86<italic>g</italic>, which breaks TMH3 of MrpG in half and bends it at a point where this helix contacts the MrpE ferredoxin-fold domain with its essential P114. Such architecture suggests that conformational interactions are important in this area, perhaps as a part of gating for Na<sup>+</sup> entry and exit.</p><p>Summing up, surface and cavity charge distribution, analysis of channels and cavities, patterns of sequence conservation and mutagenesis results, cryo-EM density for bound cations and basic mechanistic considerations all overwhelmingly support the Na<sup>+</sup> path as depicted in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4b,c</xref>. The key residues are arranged as a kind of ladder descending from the cytoplasm to the periplasm along the repeating pattern of the three-helix fold of the small subunits. In addition to the already discussed key residues, many further, mostly conserved, polar residues line the path all along the way, as expected for a cation pathway (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s1">Figure 4—figure supplement 1f</xref>). The path differs from the proposal for the MBH complex, where the suggested entry point roughly coincided with our view (around D35<italic>f</italic>), while the exit was proposed to be directly ‘below’, near D59<italic>f</italic> (D59<italic>b</italic> in MBH) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib54">Yu et al., 2018</xref>). However, the area around D59<italic>f</italic> (not universally conserved residue) is exposed to the periplasm and is separated from D35<italic>f</italic> by several layers of highly hydrophobic residues, therefore this proposal for the Na<sup>+</sup> path is extremely unlikely. Instead, we propose that the Na<sup>+</sup> pathway in MBH is the same as in Mrp, as all the key residues and fold are very well conserved (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3c</xref>). The double cavity in the Na<sup>+</sup>/H<sup>+</sup> coupling point is of similar size and also negatively charged in MBH. The only difference is that H40<italic>c</italic> from Mrp is replaced by D37<italic>g</italic> in MBH, a residue which is also capable of coordinating Na<sup>+</sup>. D37<italic>g</italic>, H41<italic>g</italic>, E69<italic>d</italic>, N34<italic>g</italic> and about six nearby serines are ideally arranged in MBH to coordinate two cations similarly to Mrp (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3c</xref>). In fact, in the deposited cryo-EM density of the MBH complex (EMD-7468) there is a clear density for a potential Na<sup>+</sup> ion coordinated by E69<italic>d</italic> (E706<italic>a</italic> homologue). The cavity between MbhB (MrpF) and MbhD (MrpA<sup>C</sup>) is also present but is not as large as the Na<sup>+</sup> cavity in Mrp, perhaps because of a lesser demand for temporary Na<sup>+</sup> storage in MBH. Residues that we propose to be involved in the coupling and exit points of the Na<sup>+</sup> path (from E706<italic>a</italic> to D792<italic>a</italic>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3c</xref>) were instead suggested to be a part of an additional H<sup>+</sup> translocation path in MBH, working in the opposite direction to MbhH/MrpD (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib54">Yu et al., 2018</xref>). This is again very unlikely because the site in the coupling point is extremely well suited to be a Na<sup>+</sup> binding site due to all the overwhelming evidence listed above. The main argument in support for an additional H<sup>+</sup> translocation path in MBH came from the similarity to complex I, where this pathway (E-channel) is not well established and should be working in the same direction as MrpD/Nqo14 and not in the opposite. This is hardly strong evidence, along with the absence of any credible exit point into the cytoplasm, since the proposed direct path for H<sup>+</sup> from the double cavity towards the cytoplasm (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib54">Yu et al., 2018</xref>) is blocked by several layers of hydrophobic residues both in MBH and Mrp. In summary, we suggest that the Na<sup>+</sup> path depicted in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4</xref> is common for Mrp and MBH and that the additional H<sup>+</sup> path proposed for MBH does not exist.</p></sec></sec><sec id="s3" sec-type="discussion"><title>Discussion</title><p>Importantly, a striking electrostatic imbalance of H<sup>+</sup> and Na<sup>+</sup> modules of Mrp (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2b,c</xref>), the arrangement of key residues in the H<sup>+</sup> and Na<sup>+</sup> pathways, the separation of H<sup>+</sup> cross-pathways from the LysTMH7/GluTMH5 coupling points and a remarkable similarity of the MrpA<sup>N</sup>/MrpD and MrpD/Na<sup>+</sup> coupling points (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4a,b</xref>) all collectively suggest that electrostatic interactions are the main driving force in the antiport mechanism.</p><p>Overall however, the electrostatic forces are likely to be amplified by coordinated conformational changes, because most of the key residues (including all four LysTMH8 and LysTMH12) sit on breaks of TM helices and interact with exposed backbone oxygen atoms from such breaks, so even small movements of these helices will affect each other and pK<sub>a</sub>’s of these residues. Therefore, the Mrp complex is likely to exist in two different conformational states, one of which is conductive to Na<sup>+</sup> binding from the cytoplasm and another is associated with Na<sup>+</sup> release into the periplasm. However, the difference between the states can be really minor, because changes in pK<sub>a</sub>’s can be associated with only small changes in the local environment. In order to ascertain the charge state of the key residues in our current structure, we analysed PROPKA (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Bas et al., 2008</xref>) predictions and the appearance of cryo-EM density, especially of E/D residues, since due to radiation damage carboxylates lose side-chain density in cryo-EM when they are in a charged state (but not if in a salt bridge) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Baker and Rubinstein, 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Grant and Grigorieff, 2015</xref>). These analyses suggest that both in MrpA<sup>N</sup> and MrpD LysTMH7/GluTMH5 pairs have both residues charged, LysTMH12 is charged and LysTMH8 is probably neutral. We also know that two cations (K<sup>+</sup> in our structure but usually Na<sup>+</sup> in vivo) are bound in the double cavity in the H<sup>+</sup>/Na<sup>+</sup> coupling point, with one of them likely to be destined for translocation into the periplasm, meaning that there is one additional positive charge due to the bound cation (indicated as a filled blue circle and Na<sup>+</sup> in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5</xref>).</p><fig id="fig5" position="float"><label>Figure 5.</label><caption><title>The antiport mechanism of the Mrp complex and its conservation in complex I and MBH.</title><p>(<bold>a</bold>) A likely state of the Mrp complex in the current structure, as a part of the catalytic cycle.

(<bold>d</bold>) MBH instead of a MrpA-like subunit contains a [NiFe] hydrogenase module, which oxidises ferredoxin and reduces protons to hydrogen. This module has a chain of glutamates similarly to complex I and their charge likely boosts proton translocation into the cell (opposite direction to complex I) via the modified coupling point (red dashed oval on the left). The H<sup>+</sup>/Na<sup>+</sup> coupling point and mechanism are retained from the Mrp.</p></caption><graphic mime-subtype="tiff" mimetype="image" xlink:href="elife-59407-fig5-v2.tif"/></fig><p>These considerations allow us to arrive at a model for the Mrp state in the current structure as depicted in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5a</xref> and a mechanism as follows. The distribution of charges in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5a</xref> would result from Na<sup>+</sup> charge effectively lowering the pKa of MrpD GluTMH5 (7 Å away, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s1">Figure 4—figure supplement 1c</xref>), so that it donates its proton to MrpD LysTMH7 (6 Å away). At the same time both LysTMH12 would have been protonated from the periplasm. Positive charge on MrpD LysTMH12 lowers the pKa of MrpA GluTMH5 so that it donates its proton to MrpA LysTMH7, mirroring events in MrpD. Assuming LysTMH8 was protonated before, now the positive charge both on LysTMH7 and LysTMH12 will force it to lose the proton to the cytoplasm both in MrpA<sup>N</sup> and MrpD, giving us the state in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5a</xref>. Next, if Na<sup>+</sup> is translocated towards the periplasm, MrpD LysTMH7/GluTMH5 pair will become neutral, as Na<sup>+</sup> charge has been removed and the proton from LysTMH7 can go back to GluTMH5. The absence of positive charge on LysTMH7 and the corresponding change in charge balance will now allow for MrpD LysTMH8 to be protonated by LysTMH12. In its turn, the absence of charge on MrpD LysTMH12 will allow for the MrpA LysTMH7/GluTMH5 pair to become neutral, and then for MrpA LysTMH8 to become protonated by MrpA LysTMH12 in a similar sequence of events, with the system arriving to the state depicted in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5b</xref>. The system is now reset, and the arrival of another Na<sup>+</sup> ion from the cytoplasm to the coupling site will set events in motion leading to state in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1a</xref>, accompanied by the translocation of two protons into the cytoplasm. Here we discussed how Na<sup>+</sup> ion would drive proton translocation, but of course the reverse cycle is also applicable, and so proton translocation into the cell, driven by ΔΨ, would result in Na<sup>+</sup> being pumped out.</p><p>We believe that this mechanism explains all the properties of Mrp-catalysed antiport on the basis of prominent structural features. The ability to couple the translocation of two H<sup>+</sup> inside the cell in exchange for one Na<sup>+</sup> moving outside is achieved by the inter-MrpA<sup>N</sup>-MrpD coupling point. A similar coupling principle, but with a cation binding site instead of LysTMH12 and an opposing directionality, is employed at the MrpD-MrpG interface. Coordinating/amplifying conformational interactions are possible because a break in TMH7 directly contacts a break in TMH8, while the loop from the TMH12 break directly contacts GluTMH5 from neighbouring APLS. Helix HL connects TMH7s on the cytoplasmic side (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2d</xref>) and additionally, striking β-hairpin (βH) elements connect APLS on the periplasmic side both in Mrp and in complex I. Links to βH both of TMH5 (D157<italic>a</italic> and D128<italic>d</italic>) and TMH8 (D104<italic>a</italic> and D75<italic>d</italic>) are critical for activity (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="supp1">Supplementary file 1</xref>). Finally, a striking tilt of TM helices in the Na<sup>+</sup>-translocating part of the complex as compared to the H<sup>+</sup>-translocating domain (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2d</xref>) might have a role in coupling if helices change the tilt during the catalytic cycle.</p><p>This two-APLS unit can be elegantly extended to three (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib44">Sazanov, 2015</xref>) or four (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Chadwick et al., 2018</xref>) APLS in complex I-like enzymes or shortened to one in MBH (or FHL-1 or Ech enzymes [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Efremov and Sazanov, 2012</xref>]), with the same mechanism applicable. The main difference to Mrp would be that in complex I (or membrane-bound hydrogenases [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Efremov and Sazanov, 2012</xref>]) instead of a positive charge of Na<sup>+</sup>, the coupling is achieved with a net negative charge being produced as two protons are abstracted during electron transfer and reduction of quinone to quinol or reduction of protons to hydrogen gas. The linking of three APLS units in complex I allows for the translocation of three protons in a similar to Mrp mechanism, while the fourth proton is likely translocated via the E-channel, as depicted in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5c</xref>. In complex I the additional APLS subunit Nqo13/NuoM is unique as it has a conserved GluTMH12 instead of a lysine, which may allow this subunit to operate in an anti-phase with the other two APLS. Such a feature may be important to prevent excessive build-up of electrostatic imbalance in the membrane domain of complex I during the catalytic cycle. The E-channel structurally coincides with the exit path for Na<sup>+</sup> (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3b</xref>) while the entry part is not homologous and is replaced in complex I with many glutamates (hence the E-channel) leading on towards the quinone-binding site as a putative proton ‘relay’.</p><p>In MBH the redox [NiFe]-hydrogenase module is attached to a single APLS unit from the opposite site as compared to complex I (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3a</xref>). As noted above, the additional H<sup>+</sup> pathway proposed for MBH (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib54">Yu et al., 2018</xref>) is very unlikely from structural considerations, and in any case it would lead to a futile cycle of protons coming in via MbhH and exiting via this additional pathway. It was discussed previously that the hydrogenase module of MBH evolves H<sub>2</sub> and generates a proton gradient, whereas the Mrp module transforms it into a Na<sup>+</sup> gradient (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">McTernan et al., 2014</xref>). We suggest that the Na<sup>+</sup> pathway in MBH is the same as we propose for Mrp, while the energy of the redox reaction (which is quite small for MBH with ΔE = 60 mV [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib54">Yu et al., 2018</xref>]) is used to boost the translocation of a proton into the cell via MbhH, a standard APLS with all the key residues conserved (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3c</xref>). The reversal of the redox module compared to complex I would then make complete sense because the redox energy would be used in MBH to drive proton translocation in the opposite direction as compared to complex I or FHL-type hydrogenases (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Efremov and Sazanov, 2012</xref>), and so from the electrostatics point of view the charge would need to be delivered to APLS from the opposite side. Thus, instead of two APLS units driving Na<sup>+</sup> in Mrp, in MBH one APLS unit supported by the redox reaction would drive Na<sup>+</sup> in a similar to Mrp mechanism (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5d</xref>).</p><p>In conclusion, the Mrp structure revealed basic operating principles of this ancient antiport system, which forms the basis of a huge variety of modern redox proton and sodium pumps. The mechanism that we propose, based on electrostatics and supported by conformational interactions, is likely to be applicable to all members of this group.</p></sec><sec id="s4"

Grids were stored in liquid nitrogen. Images were collected at 35° tilt using a 300 kV Titan Krios electron microscope equipped with a Gatan K3 camera and an energy filter set to a slit width of 20 eV at the Institute of Science and Technology Austria. Micrographs were collected with the FEI EPU package for the LMNG dataset or SerialEM for the DDM dataset, at a nominal magnification of 105,000 x, resulting in a calibrated physical pixel size of 0.84 Å per pixel. Defocus values varied from 0.6 μm to 2.3 μm. A total dose of 85 e<sup>-</sup>/Å<sup>2</sup> was fractionated into 85 frames for the LMNG-dataset.

Processing was done in Relion 3.0.7 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib45">Scheres, 2012</xref>). Movie frames were motion-corrected, dose-weighted and super-resolution images were binned two-fold using MotionCor2 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib58">Zheng et al., 2017</xref>). Contrast transfer function (CTF) parameters were determined for aligned micrographs using CTFFIND4 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib41">Rohou and Grigorieff, 2015</xref>). After a manual inspection of the Thon rings, bad micrographs showing ice rings were excluded from further analysis, yielding 755 good micrographs for normal resolution and 3096 for super resolution movies. Auto-picking with 3D references, which were the 3D auto-refined dimer map from the DDM dataset in C2 symmetry low-pass-filtered to 30 Å, resulted in 198565 particles for normal resolution and 693504 particles for super resolution micrographs. The coordinates of the particles were then used for a per-particle CTF estimation using Gctf (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib55">Zhang, 2016</xref>). Star files from normal and super-resolution micrographs were merged after Gctf estimation. At this stage and at all stages during the entire processing of both LMNG and DDM datasets, when particles were re-extracted after classification or refinement, the duplicates were removed using 100 Å minimum inter-particle distance. 2D classification was attempted but it did not improve the results. 3D classification of all picked particles, extracted in a 256 pixel box (down-sampled to 1.68 Å pixel) was carried out in C1 symmetry with a 3D auto-refined dimer map from the DDM dataset as initial reference, filtered to 30 Å. This resulted in four good classes with 606671 particles. The best class was selected yielding 264961 particles. Particles were re-extracted in a 512 pixel box (0.84 Å pixel). An initial 3D auto-refinement in C2, with local angular searches and a 3D auto-refined dimer map from the DDM dataset filtered to 30 Å as a reference resulted in a map with an overall resolution of 5.5 Å.</p></sec><sec id="s4-7"><title>Monomer</title><p>The resolution of the dimer map was limited due to variable angle between the monomers, resulting in the loss of true C2 symmetry for the entire particle pool. The particles were therefore symmetry-expanded according to the C2 point group, meaning that the particle number was enlarged twice because each dimer particle produced two monomer particles. Particles were re-extracted with re-centring on a monomer in a 512 pixel box (0.84 Å pixel). Removal of duplicates during re-extraction resulted in the loss of a few particles, which were probably coming from two neighboring dimers, and so the final number of particles is slightly less than double. 3D classification of these monomers, with local angular searches and a monomer map (excised in Chimera from the auto-refined dimer map and filtered to 8 Å) as a reference resulted in two good classes, with combined 285688 particles. These particles were re-extracted in a 512 pixel box (0.84 Å pixel) for masked 3D auto-refinement in C1, with local searches and the same monomer map as during 3D classification as a reference, which resulted in a map with an overall resolution of 3.16 Å. After post processing and polishing, 3D auto-refinement was repeated with local angular searches and a monomer map as a reference, resulting in a map with an overall resolution of 3.05 Å.

Masked 3D auto-refinement of this class, re-extracted in a 512 pixel box (0.84 Å pixel) was conducted in C2 symmetry with a map of this class filtered to 8 Å as a reference, resulting in a map with an overall resolution of 3.7 Å.

Processing was done in Relion 3.0.2. Movie frames were motion corrected, dose weighted and binned two-fold using MotionCor2. CTF parameters were determined for each micrograph from non-dose-weighted, aligned images using CTFFIND4. The data was manually examined and micrographs showing poor power spectra, large portions of carbon or extensive ice-contaminations were excluded, yielding 1255 good micrographs. Auto-picking with 3D references filtered to 30 Å resulted in 226371 particles. The 3D references came from a 3D auto-refined map that was generated in a previous low-resolution test data set. The coordinates of the particles were then used for a per-particle estimation using Gctf. Particles were extracted in a 256 pixel box (down-sampled to 1.68 Å pixel). 2D classification resulted in four good classes with 150138 particles. 3D classification was carried out in C1 symmetry using as initial reference a 30 Å low-pass-filtered map that was generated in C2 symmetry using initial model generation tool in Relion.</p></sec><sec id="s4-10"><title>Monomer</title><p>After 3D classification two good classes were selected, resulting in 140351 particles.

Another masked 3D auto-refinement with particles re-extracted in a 512 pixel box (0.84 Å pixel), starting with local searches in C1 symmetry, followed by post-processing resulted in a map with a resolution of 3.7 Å. The map revealed that helices were left-handed (50:50 chance of that since the initial dimer model was generated de novo) and so this map and all further reference maps for monomers and dimers had their hand inverted for further processing. Particle-polishing and 3D auto-refinement improved the resolution to 3.41 Å.</p></sec><sec id="s4-11"><title>Dimer</title><p>After first 3D classification, two good classes with 140351 particles were selected. Several rounds of 3D classification were performed with the reference model in the correct hand (initial model with inverted hand and filtered to 30 Å), which resulted in one good class with 89240 particles. Further 3D classification with global searches in C1 symmetry resulted in three classes with 10125, 21450 and 25395 particles per class. Masked 3D auto-refinement with particles extracted in a 512 pixel box (0.84 Å pixel), in C2 symmetry and local searches was performed with each class.

Morphing was used to adjust the model to fit the cryo-EM map using PHENIX software (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Adams et al., 2010</xref>). The model was then manually corrected using Coot (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Emsley and Cowtan, 2004</xref>) and refined against the cryo-EM map in real space using PHENIX with our protocol for cryo-EM structure refinement which allows electron radiation-damaged carboxyl side-chains to acquire high B-factors, so they don’t distort the backbone (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Letts et al., 2019</xref>). Densities for several lipids could be detected. Based on the appearance of their density and the prevalence of phosphatidylethanolamine among <italic>E. coli</italic> lipids, phosphatidylethanolamine was modelled into these densities.</p><p>The initial model was built into the DDM-dataset monomer density and then extended and completed in the LMNG-dataset monomer density. For accurate modelling of water molecules, particularly to avoid false positives, we filtered the LMNG monomer map by local resolution in Relion and resampled it at 0.5 Å per pixel (akin to the water modelling procedure in phenix.douse). After this procedure, water molecules displayed strong signals (~2 rmsd), had nearly spherical densities, were not clashing with other atoms and participated in hydrogen bonds, which are all strongly indicative of real water molecules. This allowed automatic placement of water molecules in COOT, which were then all checked and corrected manually, to leave only waters with clear density and fulfilling geometry criteria. K<sup>+</sup> ions were placed on the basis of density and a coordination pattern by nitrogen atoms from histidines and oxygen atoms from waters or serines and glutamine. The average coordination distance was about 2.8–3.0 Å, consistent with known values for K<sup>+</sup> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Harding, 2002</xref>). Mg was present in the crystallisation buffer but was excluded as a candidate for bound ions since it should have stronger density and is normally coordinated by at least several negatively charged residues, with average coordination distances of about 2.2 Å (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib57">Zheng et al., 2008</xref>). One of K ions (#1, to the left in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s1">Figure 2—figure supplement 1e,f</xref>) is found in the identical positions in LMNG and DDM maps, while another one (#2, to the right in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s1">Figure 2—figure supplement 1e,f</xref>) is shifted by about 3 Å. However, ion #2 is still located within the same cavity and is coordinated by the same residues in both cases (H40<italic>c</italic>, H37<italic>c</italic> and N702<italic>a</italic>). The difference is probably due to partly disordered/disturbed DDM structure. Therefore we conclude that DDM density supports the notion that cavity is able to coordinate two K<sup>+</sup> ions, but for a detailed discussion we use K<sup>+</sup> ions from the higher resolution and more complete LMNG model.</p><p>For the final refinement of the dimer, two monomer densities at 3.0 Å resolution were combined in Chimera after their fit into the 3.7 Å resolution dimer density. Two monomer models were fit into this composite map and refined in one final round.</p></sec><sec id="s4-13"><title>Introduction of site-directed mutations</title><p>Gibson assembly (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Gibson et al., 2009</xref>) was used for the construction of plasmids with point mutations in AF_Mrp (MrpE L41W, MrpG S72W and MrpF D35L). The point mutations in MrpE and MrpG were chosen to disrupt the Mrp dimer. The point mutation in MrpF was chosen due to the putative involvement of this residue in Na<sup>+</sup> translocation. Each mutated plasmid was generated by combining two big DNA fragments of similar size, which were produced by two independent PCRs using AF_Mrp as template by means of Gibson assembly. The Gibson assembly method requires that the DNA fragments have ~20 base pairs overlaps with the adjacent fragment. The overlaps were added to the ends of the fragments by means of long (~40 base pairs) primers, which also contained the point mutation. The sequence of the mutated plasmids was confirmed by sequencing.</p></sec><sec id="s4-14"><title>Preparation of everted membrane vesicles</title><p>Everted membrane vesicles (EMV) were prepared as previously described (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Ambudkar et al., 1984</xref>), with some changes. <italic>E. coli</italic> KNabc cells were transformed with the respective plasmid and grown in LBK medium containing the respective antibiotics for 16 hr at 37°C. The cells were harvested at 4000 x g and the pellet was washed two times with 10 mM Bis-Tris-Propane-Sulfate pH 7.5, 5 mM MgCl<sub>2</sub>, 140 mM choline chloride and 10% glycerol and resuspended in the same buffer. Constant System pressure cell was used to prepare EMV by passing the resuspended cells through the cell disruptor for a single time at 10,000 psi. The cell suspension was centrifuged at 36,000 x g for 15 min followed by a centrifugation at 180,000 x g for 1.5 hr. The same procedure was done for the control, which were non-transformed KNabc cells. The EMV were suspended at 20 mg/ml and stored at −80°C.</p></sec><sec id="s4-15"><title>Antiport assay</title><p>Na<sup>+</sup>/H<sup>+</sup> antiport activity assay was performed as previously described (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Morino et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib48">Swartz et al., 2007</xref>). 66 µg of EMV were suspended in 2 ml 10 mM Bis-Tris-Propane-Sulfate, 140 mM choline chloride, 5 mM MgCl<sub>2</sub>, 1 µM acridine orange at pH 7.5, pH 8.5 or pH 9.5. Measurements were conducted with excitation and emission at 420 and 500 nm, respectively, using a Spectramax M2e Plate and Cuvette reader. Tris-succinate at pH 7.5, pH 8.5 or pH 9.5 was added to a final concentration of 2.5 mM to initiate respiration. After fluorescence quenching of acridine orange, a steady-state was reached and NaCl or KCl was added to a final concentration of 2.5 mM. The Na<sup>+</sup> dependent fluorescence dequenching is indicative for the Na<sup>+</sup>/H<sup>+</sup> antiport activity. NH<sub>4</sub>Cl was added to a concentration of 10 mM to bring the fluorescence back to baseline. Assays were conducted in triplicates with three independent membrane preparations.</p></sec><sec id="s4-16"><title>Growth experiments</title><p>Growth experiments were conducted as previously described (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Kosono et al., 2006</xref>). <italic>E. coli</italic> KNabc cells were transformed with the respective plasmid and incubated for 16 hr at 37°C in LBK medium containing 0–1200 mM NaCl. KNabc cells lack the three main sodium proton antiporters and can withstand a salt concentration of up to 200–300 mM. A functional Mrp antiporter complements the inability of KNabc cells to grow at higher salt concentrations.</p></sec></sec></body><back><ack id="ack"><title>Acknowledgements</title><p>This research was supported by the Scientific Service Units (SSU) of IST Austria through resources provided by the Electron Microscopy Facility (EMF), the Life Science Facility (LSF) and the IST high-performance computing cluster.

Your article has been reviewed by three peer reviewers, and the evaluation has been overseen by Sriram Subramaniam as Reviewing Editor and Olga Boudker as the Senior Editor. The following individuals involved in review of your submission have agreed to reveal their identity: Joel Meyerson (Reviewer #1); Doreen Matthies (Reviewer #2).</p><p>The reviewers have discussed the reviews with one another and the Reviewing Editor has drafted this decision to help you prepare a revised submission.</p><p>We would like to draw your attention to changes in our revision policy that we have made in response to COVID-19 (https://elifesciences.org/articles/57162).

At high extracellular pH Mrp is hypothesized to translocate 2H<sup>+</sup> / 1Na<sup>+</sup>, and it is proposed to have a large surface area to allow for the few available external protons to be gathered for translocation into the cell. However, the mechanism of coupling in this family is unknown. This study succeeds in resolving a structure Mrp and provides a comprehensive analysis and comparative analysis with MBH and Complex I.</p><p>Essential revisions:</p><p>Please address all of the points below in the revised manuscript:</p><p>• How did the authors discriminate between water molecules, K<sup>+</sup> ions, and noise during modeling? This is an important part of the analysis and details should be given in the manuscript.</p><p>• The authors provided a map and model which appears to be the Mrp-LMNG structure. The structure of Mrp in DDM was also used for analysis, including for localizing K<sup>+</sup> ions. This map and model should be made available.</p><p>• Figure 2—figure supplement 1F: In panels E and F (DDM and LMNG maps) the proposed K<sup>+</sup> ions appear in different positions. Can the authors comment on this?</p><p>• Water molecules are modeled in Figure 2—figure supplement 1 but they do not appear to be present in the PDB file included with the submission.</p><p>• In Figure 2A and in the manuscript the authors talk about membrane thinning near the dimerization area of the complex based on hydrophobicity analysis of the surface of the structure. The detergent belt around the protein in the map can be a good indication of the location of the membrane and its thickness and I encourage the authors to analyze their unmasked or lower resolution maps to either support their claim or not. Also if any lipid or detergent densities are visible in the high resolution maps near that location and the head groups on the outer side are actually shifted, I'd be more convinced of this claim than just simply based on hydrophobicity. Also, the final dimer map has a 20 degree tilt between the monomers. I understand that this small subset was identified during 3D classification and resulted in the highest resolution map but more than 50% of the dimers seem to show tilts of 4-9 degrees only. This raises the question on how representative this particular dimer structure is of this complex.</p><p>• Two densities have been assigned to K<sup>+</sup> and interpreted as Na<sup>+</sup> binding sites. These densities have also been observed in the 3.41 A DDM monomer map. What are the arguments that this is indeed K<sup>+</sup> and not stabilizing Mg ions? The buffer contains 5 mM MgCl2. These specific densities assigned to K<sup>+</sup> in Figure 2—figure supplement 1E and F (displaying the DDM and LMNG maps) also look like they are at different locations. Figure 4—figure supplement 1C shows Na binding sites.

[…] Mg was present in the purification buffer but was excluded as a candidate for bound ions since it should have stronger density and is normally coordinated by at least several negatively charged residues, with average coordination distances of about 2.2 Å (Zheng et al., 2008).”</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>• The authors provided a map and model which appears to be the Mrp-LMNG structure.

Included K<sup>+</sup> ions were fitted into this DDM map, as used for Figure 2 —figure supplement 1. We do not think it is informative to provide the initial DDM model, as it was severely incomplete, as described in the manuscript.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>• Figure 2—figure supplement 1: In panels E and F (DDM and LMNG maps) the proposed K<sup>+</sup> ions appear in different positions. Can the authors comment on this?</p></disp-quote><p>Indeed, one of the ions (#1, to the left in Figure 2—figure supplement 1E, F) is found in the identical positions in LMNG and DDM maps, while another one (#2, to the right in Figure 2—figure supplement 1E, F) is shifted by about 3 Å. However, ion #2 is still located within the same cavity and is coordinated by the same residues in both cases (H40c, H37c and N702a). The difference is probably due to partly disordered/disturbed DDM structure. Therefore, we conclude that the DDM density supports the notion that the cavity is able to coordinate two K<sup>+</sup> ions, but for a detailed discussion we used K<sup>+</sup> ions from the higher resolution and more complete LMNG model.</p><p>We have now added this information into the Materials and methods section.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>• Water molecules are modeled in Figure 2—figure supplement 1 but they do not appear to be present in the PDB file included with the submission.</p></disp-quote><p>With the revised manuscript we have included the LMNG monomer map filtered by local resolution in Relion and then re-sampled at 0.5 Å, as described above for modeling of waters. The monomer model with waters, refined in this map, is also included. Since due to the still limited resolution we used these experimental waters only for the comparison with predictions from Dowser, and use Dowser waters for the analysis of proton translocation pathways, we would prefer not to deposit these files in the PDB. The PDB-deposited dimer model is more representative of the physiological unit consisting of intertwined monomers.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>• In Figure 2A and in the manuscript the authors talk about membrane thinning near the dimerization area of the complex based on hydrophobicity analysis of the surface of the structure.

The belt is indeed much thinner in the dimerization area, supporting our proposal. There are no well-resolved lipids in this area, unfortunately. We also think that Figures 2A and Figure 2—figure supplement 1G illustrate quite strongly that not only the hydrophobic exposed belt is thinner at the dimer interface, there is simply not enough protein to fully traverse the intact membrane – due to the very short TMH1/2 from MrpE subunit, the protein is only about 20 Å thick at the dimer interface. We now mention these facts in the subsection “Overall structure”.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Also, the final dimer map has a 20 degree tilt between the monomers. I understand that this small subset was identified during 3D classification and resulted in the highest resolution map but more than 50% of the dimers seem to show tilts of 4-9 degrees only. This raises the question on how representative this particular dimer structure is of this complex.</p></disp-quote><p>In the LMNG dataset about 55% of particles had angles between 4-9 degrees and about 45% between 17-20 degrees. In the DDM dataset all particles had angles between 20-28 degrees. We mentioned in the original text that the LMNG dimers were overall “flatter” than the DDM dimers and so may be closer to their native shape since the lipid bilayer is flat. We did not imply that they have to be absolutely flat in terms of the apparent angle between the monomers. Further considerations indicate that the ~20 degree dimers are probably closest to native, as in this case the exposed hydrophobic belt area is closer to being flat (Figure 2A). The impression of a relative tilt of monomers is exacerbated by the quite large hydrophilic cytoplasmic domains at the dimer interface. Furthermore, all dimers refining to the highest resolution had angles close to 20 degrees, suggesting that they are probably closest to their physiological state. As we also needed the highest resolution dimers to verify the contacts between the monomers, we used the best class (leading to 3.7 Å map, Figure 1—figure supplement 3) for further analysis. Comparisons of maps of various dimers did not reveal any specific differences in the overall structure, apart from different apparent angles between the monomers, suggesting that the discussed structure is a valid representative. We have added these considerations in the subsection “Structure determination”.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>• Two densities have been assigned to K<sup>+</sup> and interpreted as Na<sup>+</sup> binding sites.

We use LysTMH7/8/12 and GluTMH5 nomenclature only for key conserved and essential lysine and glutamate residues which define proton channels in the three homologous antiporter-like subunits (APLS) in complex I and related proteins, including Mrp. This is a standard nomenclature in the field and it makes it much easier to follow discussion of proton channels, as it applies to any of APLS. Otherwise one will have to list two-three unique residues for the description of each feature, as well as mentioning each time where a particular residue sits, making it difficult for discussion. On the detailed structural figures, on the other hand, it makes much more sense to label each particular residue with its own residue number. This has been a tradition in complex I field for a long time already, so we would prefer to use it here as well.</p><p>Typos were corrected, thanks.</p></body></sub-article></article>
