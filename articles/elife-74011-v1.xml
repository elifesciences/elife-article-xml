unrelated autobiographical information, creating a perceptually decoupled state detrimental to narrative comprehension. To understand how this mind-wandering state emerges, we asked whether retrieving autobiographical content necessitates functional disengagement from visual input. In Experiment 1, brain activity was recorded using functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) in an experimental situation mimicking naturally occurring mind-wandering, allowing us to precisely delineate neural regions involved in memory and reading. Individuals read expository texts and ignored personally relevant autobiographical memories, as well as the opposite situation. Medial regions of the default mode network (DMN) were recruited during memory retrieval. In contrast, left temporal and lateral prefrontal regions of the DMN, as well as ventral visual cortex, were recruited when reading for comprehension. Experiment two used functional connectivity both at rest and during tasks to establish that (i) DMN regions linked to memory are more functionally decoupled from regions of ventral visual cortex than regions in the same network engaged when reading; and (ii) individuals with more self-generated mental contents and poorer comprehension, while reading in the lab, showed more decoupling between visually connected DMN sites important for reading and primary visual cortex. A similar pattern of connectivity was found in Experiment 1, with greater coupling between this DMN site and visual cortex when participants reported greater focus on reading in the face of conflict from autobiographical memory cues; moreover, the retrieval of personally relevant memories increased the decoupling of these sites. These converging data suggest we lose track of the narrative when our minds wander because generating autobiographical mental content relies on cortical regions within the DMN which are functionally decoupled from ventral visual regions engaged during reading.</p></abstract><abstract abstract-type="executive-summary"><title>eLife digest</title><p>As your eyes scan these words, you may be thinking about what to make for dinner, how to address an unexpected hurdle at work, or how many emails are sitting, unread, in your inbox. This type of mind-wandering disrupts our focus and limits how much information we comprehend, whilst also being conducive to creative thinking and problem-solving.</p><p>Despite being an everyday occurrence, exactly how our mind wanders remains elusive. One possible explanation is that the brain disengages from visual information from the external world and turns its attention inwards. A greater understanding of which neural circuits are involved in this process could reveal insights about focus, attention, and reading comprehension.</p><p>Here, Zhang et al. investigated whether the brain becomes disengaged from visual input when our mind wanders while reading. Recalling personal events was used as a proxy for mind-wandering. Brain activity was recorded as participants were shown written statements; sometimes these were preceded by cues to personal memories. People were asked to focus on reading the statements or they were instructed to concentrate on their memories while ignoring the text. The analyses showed that recalling memories and reading stimulated distinct parts of the brain, which were in direct competition during mind-wandering.</p><p>Further work examined how these regions were functionally connected. In individuals who remained focused on reading despite memory cues, the areas activated by reading showed strong links to the visual cortex. Conversely, these reading-related areas became ‘decoupled’ from visual processing centres in people who were focusing more on their internal thoughts.</p><p>These results shed light on why we lose track of what we are reading when our mind wanders: recalling personal memories activates certain brain areas which are functionally decoupled from the regions involved in processing external information – such as the words on a page.</p><p>In summary, the work by Zhang et al. builds a mechanistic understanding of mind-wandering, a natural feature of our daily brain activity. These insights may help to inform future interventions in education to improve reading, comprehension and focus.</p></abstract><kwd-group kwd-group-type="author-keywords"><kwd>default mode network</kwd><kwd>mind-wandering</kwd><kwd>reading</kwd><kwd>autobiographical memory</kwd></kwd-group><kwd-group kwd-group-type="research-organism"><title>Research organism</title><kwd>Human</kwd></kwd-group><funding-group><award-group id="fund1"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100000781</institution-id><institution>European Research Council</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>Project ID: 771863 - FLEXSEM</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Jefferies</surname><given-names>Elizabeth</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund2"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100004543</institution-id><institution>China Scholarship Council</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>CSC Scholarship No. 201704910952</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Zhang</surname><given-names>Meichao</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><funding-statement>The funders had no role in study design, data collection and interpretation, or the decision to submit the work for publication.</funding-statement></funding-group><custom-meta-group><custom-meta specific-use="meta-only"><meta-name>Author impact statement</meta-name><meta-value>Functional neuroimaging in the human brain reveals the neurocognitive mechanisms that underpin the experience of mind-wandering during reading, explaining why comprehension is impaired.</meta-value></custom-meta></custom-meta-group></article-meta></front><body><sec id="s1" sec-type="intro"><title>Introduction</title><p>The human mind is remarkably flexible, capable of shifting focus from information in the external environment to perceptually decoupled states that are generated from information in memory (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Baird et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib46">Smallwood, 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib50">Smallwood et al., 2021b</xref>). This capacity for self-generating mental content is ubiquitous across cultures and has links to both beneficial and detrimental features of cognition (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">Mooneyham and Schooler, 2013</xref>). Although self-generated states are common in daily life (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Kane et al., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">Poerio et al., 2013</xref>), they can be problematic if they occur during reading (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">McVay and Kane, 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib43">Smallwood et al., 2008</xref>). The detrimental effects of mind-wandering on reading are believed to occur because this state elicits perceptual decoupling that disrupts narrative comprehension (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib44">Smallwood, 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib46">Smallwood, 2013</xref>).</p><p>Contemporary work in cognitive neuroscience has shown that both reading for comprehension (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Andrews-Hanna et al., 2014b</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Binder et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Mar, 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib63">Yang et al., 2019</xref>), and off-task states (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Christoff et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Konu et al., 2020</xref>), are linked to activity within the default mode network (DMN). For example, the building blocks of reading for comprehension are conceptual representations supported by regions overlapping with DMN in the anterior, ventral and lateral temporal lobe (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Lambon Ralph et al., 2017</xref>). In contrast, the content of self-generated thoughts often comes from autobiographical memory (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib45">Smallwood et al., 2011</xref>), linked to medial regions of the DMN including posterior cingulate, ventral prefrontal and inferior parietal cortex (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">Ritchey and Cooper, 2020</xref>). Furthermore, studies of individual differences highlight that both better reading comprehension, as well as greater tendency for off-task thought, are predictable based on neural patterns in the DMN, as well as in other cortical regions (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib47">Smallwood et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib67">Zhang et al., 2019</xref>). For example, individuals who are better at reading for comprehension show more functional integration between lateral and medial elements of the DMN, while individuals who tend to be more off-task show greater decoupling between the DMN and regions of visual cortex important for visual processing during reading (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib47">Smallwood et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib67">Zhang et al., 2019</xref>).</p><p>Converging empirical and theoretical evidence, therefore, suggests that both reading for comprehension, and off-task self-generated states, depend on regions within the broader DMN. Recent views suggest the DMN’s role in cognition emerges from this system’s topographic location, with core nodes located in regions that are distant in both functional and structural terms from unimodal cortex (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Margulies et al., 2016</xref>). This topographical organisation has been argued to explain the role of the DMN in multiple cognitive states because it locates this network at the end of information processing streams that are necessary for relatively abstract tasks (like reading comprehension) but also explains why the same network can be involved in states that require disengagement from the here and now (such as mind-wandering; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib49">Smallwood et al., 2021a</xref>). This topographically informed view of the DMN provides a novel hypothesis for why mind-wandering creates a situation in which we lose track of the meaning of the words we are reading: the process of generating mental content using information from memory leads to a perceptually decoupled state associated with poor comprehension. When this occurs, there is a shift in the balance of neural activity within the DMN, away from DMN regions functionally coupled with ventral visual regions important for reading comprehension, to other regions within DMN that are more isolated from perceptual input.</p><p>To test this account of the consequences of mind-wandering while reading, we conducted two experiments using fMRI to measure brain activity. In Experiment 1, participants (N = 29) performed tasks that mimicked the experience of mind-wandering while reading. In one condition, participants were presented with information from an expository text on the screen and were asked to scan these words while instead retrieving a personally-relevant autobiographical memory. In a second condition, participants focused on a similar expository text, while refraining from attending to autobiographical information. Our experiment exploits the fact that self-generated states can be understood as the spontaneous engagement of processes that can also be recruited as part of a task (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib46">Smallwood, 2013</xref>). By exploiting this ‘component process’ view we could identify, with a high degree of precision, the neural regions involved in the two cognitive components of interest: autobiographical memory retrieval and reading for comprehension. Experiment 2 examined the functional architecture of regions involved in these two states, evaluating whether the DMN regions important for reading are more functionally connected to the ventral visual stream than the DMN regions involved in autobiographical memory (N = 243). Finally, we also sought to generalise these results by examining whether functional relationships between regions implicated in our experimental task, which was designed to mimic mind-wandering while reading, could predict individual differences in a previously published dataset that looked at naturally occurring mind-wandering during reading (N = 69; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib67">Zhang et al., 2019</xref>).</p><p>Foreshadowing our results, we found that (a) left lateral prefrontal and temporal regions of the DMN, within the dorsomedial subsystem (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Andrews-Hanna et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib65">Yeo et al., 2011</xref>), are important for reading, while regions of the core DMN are engaged during autobiographical memory (medial prefrontal, posterior cingulate, and angular gyrus); (b) regions of the DMN linked to reading are more functionally connected to ventral visual regions than DMN regions implicated in autobiographical memory; (c) DMN regions linked to reading are decoupled from primary visual cortex for individuals who naturally generate more mind-wandering content during reading, generalising our experimental paradigm to an ecologically valid situation; and (d) this perceptual decoupling pattern linked to individual variation in mind-wandering during reading is also modulated by our task manipulation, with greater perceptual decoupling during the retrieval of personally relevant memories in the absence of sentences and less decoupling when participants remain focussed on reading despite distracting autobiographical memory cues. Together these data support the hypothesis that processes involved in the generation of mental content from memory depend on regions in the DMN that are functionally decoupled from ventral visual regions important for reading. Our analysis, therefore, suggests that the reason we lose track of the narrative when our mind wanders during reading is because the generation of autobiographical content relies on neural activity in core DMN regions and this encourages a state of perceptual decoupling that reduces comprehension of external input. This perceptually decoupled state is broadly comparable across a laboratory situation that mimics mind-wandering and an individual differences analysis of this feature of cognition in a more naturalistic setting.</p></sec><sec id="s2" sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><sec id="s2-1"><title>Experiment 1</title><sec id="s2-1-1"><title>Design</title><p>The experiment took place over 2 days. On Day 1, participants were asked to identify specific personal events linked to each autobiographical memory cue (words like <sc>PARTY</sc>). On Day 2, they recalled these memories when presented with the cue word in the scanner, and also completed the reading task, which involved reading factual sentences about similar concepts. For the task inside the scanner, we employed a within-subjects 2 × 2 design manipulating task (Autobiographical memory recall vs. Reading) and conflict (Conflict vs. No conflict). Participants were asked to either comprehend sentences presented word-by-word, or recall their personal memories, as a proxy for mind-wandering. To mimic the experience of mind-wandering while reading, in conflict trials, the two processes (Reading vs. Autobiographical memory recall) were pitted against one another – with participants required to either (1) recall autobiographical information, whilst irrelevant sentences were presented word-by-word on the screen or (2) read a sentence while trying to suppress a cued autobiographical memory. In this way, the conflict between these two opposing mental states was created by presenting sentences during memory recall, or memory cues before sentences, eliciting the kinds of cognitive states that occur when our minds wander during reading. To understand the conflict effect on each task, no conflict trials replaced sentences and autobiographical memory cue with letter strings (e.g. XXX); consequently, there was no conflicting information for participants to process (see the left hand of <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1</xref> for an illustration of the task). After each reading or memory recall trial, task focus ratings on a scale of 1 (i.e., not at all) to 7 (i.e., very much) were collected to index the extent to which participants were able to focus on the primary task.</p><fig id="fig1" position="float"><label>Figure 1.</label><caption><title>Task illustration and results of ratings.</title><p><italic><bold>Left hand panel: Task design of Experiment 1.</bold></italic> Using a counterbalanced design, participants either engaged in normal reading, or instead were focused on retrieval of personally-relevant information from memory.

A repeated-measures Analysis of Variance (ANOVA) was used to examine this question by comparing the effects of autobiographical memory retrieval on reading (and vice versa). Participants reported reduced task focus on the primary task for both reading and autobiographical memory retrieval when both tasks were presented at the same time (i.e., in Conflict conditions), <italic>F</italic>(1,28) = 44.28, <italic>p</italic> &lt; 0.001, <italic>η<sub>p</sub><sup>2</sup> =</italic> .61 (see panel A in the right hand of <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1</xref>).

For the reading trials, retrieval of autobiographical memories reduced rated comprehension, <italic>F</italic>(1,28) = 10.40, <italic>p</italic> = 0.003, <italic>η<sub>p</sub><sup>2</sup></italic> = .27, but not participants’ level of prior familiarity with the sentence material, <italic>F</italic>(1,28) = 2.10, <italic>p</italic> = 0.16, <italic>η<sub>p</sub><sup>2</sup></italic> = .07 (see panel B in the right hand of <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1</xref>).

This pattern establishes that our paradigm successfully captures important features of the mind-wandering reading state, particularly the mutual inhibition between self-generated mental content and effective reading for comprehension.</p></sec><sec id="s2-1-3"><title>Neuroimaging results</title><p>Having established the expected pattern of competition between autobiographical memory retrieval and reading, we next considered the neural correlates that distinguish these states. To examine the key differences between reading and autobiographical memory in brain activity, we performed a univariate analysis using a general linear model (GLM) to identify (i) neural differences across these tasks (performing contrasts between the main effects of task condition) and (ii) parametric effects of task focus – that is regions in which brain activity correlated with rated focus on each trial. In this model, each of the four experimental conditions (i.e., <italic>Reading with no conflict, Reading with conflict, Autobiographical memory retrieval with no conflict,</italic> and <italic>Autobiographical memory retrieval with conflict</italic>) were included as Explanatory Variables (EV) of interest, along with the parametric effect of Task Focus for each condition. All the reading and memory recall trials were included in the analysis – including the rare catch trials with colour changes, since there were no behavioural differences in colour-change detection rates across these conditions (see <xref ref-type="fig" rid="app1fig1">Appendix 1—figure 1</xref>) and these catch trials were explicitly modelled in our analysis.</p><p>Contrasting reading with autobiographical memory retrieval highlighted a set of left lateralised regions within the temporal lobe and prefrontal cortex, including inferior frontal gyrus and superior and middle temporal gyri, which are recruited during reading. Activation in bilateral ventral visual cortex was also observed. In contrast, periods when autobiographical memory was the primary task were associated with greater neural activity in regions including medial and lateral prefrontal cortex, posterior cingulate cortex and angular gyrus. In <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2A</xref>, regions showing greater activity during reading are presented in warmer colours, and regions showing greater activity during autobiographical memory retrieval are presented in cooler colours.

Our behavioural analysis demonstrated a pattern of mutual competition between the two conditions (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1</xref>); we therefore examined the relationship between the observed pattern of neural activity in each condition and a persons’ reported focus on the primary task. The results of this analysis are presented in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3A</xref> where it can be seen that regions in medial prefrontal and parietal cortex, superior frontal gyrus and left lateral parietal cortex showed a stronger effect of task focus for autobiographical memory retrieval, relative to reading. We conducted a formal conjunction to identify how these regions mapped onto those showing differential activity for the two states. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3B</xref> shows that clusters linked to better task focus for autobiographical memory retrieval also showed stronger activity during memory retrieval and lower activity during reading. Importantly, we confirmed that these regions showed significant associations with task focus separately in each task (see <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3C</xref>). Greater task focus during memory retrieval was associated with increased activation in medial prefrontal cortex, posterior parietal cortex (bordering dorsal lateral occipital cortex), superior frontal gyrus, retrosplenial cortex, and temporal fusiform cortex. These voxels largely fell within the medial temporal subsystem (50% of voxels within DMN) and core subsystem (40% of DMN voxels); there was less overlap with the dorsomedial DMN subsystem (10%). In contrast, greater task focus in reading was correlated with increased deactivation in overlapping regions in bilateral middle and medial frontal gyrus, frontal pole, insular cortex, anterior/posterior cingulate gyrus, precuneus and angular gyrus. These voxels largely fell within core DMN (82% of DMN voxels), with limited overlap in dorsomedial and medial temporal DMN subsystems (13% and 5% of DMN voxels, respectively). Therefore, when people are more focussed on autobiographical memories, there is increased activation in core and medial temporal DMN regions, while deactivation of core DMN regions is linked to greater mental focus during reading. Taken together, this analysis establishes that regions of ventromedial prefrontal cortex, posterior cingulate cortex, and superior frontal gyrus contribute to better focus on autobiographical memory retrieval while compromising the ability to read for comprehension.</p><fig id="fig3" position="float"><label>Figure 3.</label><caption><title>Parametric effects of task focus.</title><p>(<bold>A</bold>) Regions showing a differential relationship with task focus across the two states (autobiographical memory (AM) retrieval and reading).

Using two resting-state datasets, the aim of Experiment two was to understand (i) whether these DMN regions associated with reading and autobiographical memory retrieval show differences in their intrinsic functional connectivity to ventral visual regions important for reading; and (ii) how individual differences in the connectivity of these DMN seeds relate to the tendency to mind-wander during reading in a more naturalistic setting. In order to directly test the similarity in connectivity across task and rest states, Experiment 2 took the peak DMN activations for reading and autobiographical memory retrieval obtained from Experiment 1 as seed locations. In Dataset 1, we considered intrinsic connectivity differences between these DMN seeds across the whole-brain and within reading-related visual cortex identified in Experiment 1. Moreover, as our whole-brain analysis identified a site in visual cortex that was more decoupled in people who reported more contents of mind-wandering in Dataset 2, we also performed an additional connectivity analysis of the task data from Experiment 1, to establish the extent to which these connectivity patterns at rest, found to be related to individual variance in naturalistic mind-wandering during reading in Experiment 2, also occur during task-induced autobiographical memory retrieval.</p></sec><sec id="s2-3"><title>Results of resting-state intrinsic connectivity</title><p>Our first analysis examined the extent to which DMN subnetworks linked to different task states are functionally connected to regions of the ventral visual stream activated during reading. This analysis helps us to determine whether the reductions in ventral visual cortex seen in Experiment 1 during autobiographical memory retrieval solely reflect an attentional phenomenon that emerges because participants were asked to attend to memory retrieval rather than textual input, or whether these effects relate to differences in the intrinsic functional architecture of the DMN regions important for autobiographical memory retrieval and reading. To address this question, we conducted whole-brain resting-state functional connectivity analyses targeting the peak activation regions of the DMN, since they represent regions with the most differential activation associated with reading and autobiographical memory retrieval respectively (see Materials and methods). We created a reading peak seed that fell within dorsomedial DMN (MNI coordinates: −56, –10, –12) and an autobiographical memory retrieval peak seed (MNI coordinates: −6, –50, 22) that was within core DMN, by placing a binarised spherical mask with a radius of 3 mm, centred on the MNI coordinates in these selected sites. The results of this analysis can be seen in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4A</xref>; regions more strongly correlated with the DMN seed linked to reading are presented in warm colours, while those regions showing greater functional connectivity with the DMN seed linked to autobiographical memory retrieval are shown in cool colours. The reading DMN region showed greater intrinsic connectivity to regions of ventral visual cortex. We also performed a follow-up ROI analysis to examine whether there was differential intrinsic connectivity to a visual region activated during reading in Experiment 1 (MNI coordinates: −32, –92, –10), comparing DMN seeds located at peak reading and autobiographical memory retrieval sites. A paired samples <italic>t</italic>-test revealed stronger intrinsic connectivity for the reading than the autobiographical memory DMN seed to this visual site implicated during reading (Reading DMN-to-Reading visual: Mean ± <italic>SD</italic> = 0.02 ± 0.14, Autobiographical memory DMN-to-Reading visual: Mean ± <italic>SD</italic> = –0.01 ± 0.14; <italic>t</italic>(242) = 2.78, <italic>p</italic> = 0.006). This analysis provides further evidence that the DMN and visual regions showing stronger activation during reading than memory retrieval also had stronger intrinsic connectivity at rest.

The results of this analysis are presented in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4B</xref>. This ‘task-rest’ conjunction establishes that the functional connectivity of regions linked to reading is mirrored by their joint activation during reading, suggesting that co-activation of aspects of DMN and visual cortex during reading is at least partially rooted in their intrinsic functional organisation.

In the current analysis, we hoped to ascertain the similarities between the experimental situation in Experiment 1 (which mimicked processes linked to mind-wandering) and this more naturalistic context. We included individual differences in reading comprehension and off-task thoughts (i.e., frequency and content of mind-wandering including autobiographical memory; see <xref ref-type="fig" rid="app1fig6">Appendix 1—figure 6</xref>) as explanatory variables in a group-level regression and used the peak locations within the DMN that were linked to autobiographical memory retrieval and reading from Experiment 1 as seeds (with the reading seed in a different location within lateral temporal gyrus relative to our previous study). When seeding the reading DMN peak, the contrast of reading comprehension over mind-wandering content revealed regions of left primary visual cortex (corrected cluster-size <italic>p</italic>-FWE = 0.004) and right primary visual cortex (corrected cluster-size <italic>p</italic>-FWE = 0.004), as well as postcentral gyrus (corrected cluster-size <italic>p</italic>-FWE = .006), which showed stronger connectivity for individuals with better reading comprehension and less mind-wandering content reported in a questionnaire (see <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4C</xref>), in line with our previous findings (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib67">Zhang et al., 2019</xref>).

The results of this analysis are presented in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4C</xref> in the form of word clouds where the font size describes the strength of the relationship. The decoding of this connectivity map yielded terms largely linked to perception, such as ‘sensorimotor’ and ‘visual’. In summary, weaker intrinsic connectivity between visually coupled DMN regions and the visual cortex is associated with a tendency to mind-wander while reading. Importantly, this analysis establishes a link between our experimental manipulation that mimics key processes engaged during mind-wandering in reading, and a metric describing a naturally occurring example of the state. No behavioural associations were recovered when using the DMN seed linked to autobiographical memory retrieval as a seed. We re-ran all these analyses using a more stringent motion criterion, excluding individuals with mean head motion that exceeded 0.2 mm. The same pattern of results was obtained.

In particular, we tested an emerging hypothesis that spans both psychological and neural domains. At the psychological level, contemporary theories of self-generated states suggest that functional decoupling from perceptual input is important for effective memory retrieval, providing a process account of why mind-wandering during reading can derail comprehension (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib46">Smallwood, 2013</xref>). In the neural domain, we draw on a recent hypothesis that the role of DMN subnetworks in human cognition is related to their topographic location on the cortical mantle (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Margulies et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib49">Smallwood et al., 2021a</xref>). These regions occupy locations that are both the terminus of processing streams within the cortex important for abstract forms of cognition such as reading, and yet at a distance along the cortical surface from input systems, explaining why they can also be engaged by situations in which mental content is broadly unrelated to perceptual input (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib49">Smallwood et al., 2021a</xref>).</p><p>Experiment 1 established a pattern of mutual inhibition between the act of reading for comprehension and the concurrent retrieval of autobiographically-relevant content. This pattern of mutual inhibition parallels the well-established negative correlation between naturally occurring mind-wandering and an individual’s ability to comprehend what they are reading (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">McVay and Kane, 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib43">Smallwood et al., 2008</xref>). Using fMRI to index brain activity, we identified that these two states differentially recruited different aspects of the DMN in direct contrasts of these two tasks, with greater recruitment of the dorsomedial DMN subnetwork when participants were reading for comprehension, and greater activity within the core of the DMN during autobiographical memory retrieval (See also <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Chiou et al., 2020</xref>). The involvement of the DMN in both self-generated mental content and reading for comprehension is consistent with prior studies exploring trait variation in mind-wandering while reading (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib47">Smallwood et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib67">Zhang et al., 2019</xref>). Importantly, Experiment one found that ventral visual regions were engaged when participants were reading for comprehension as opposed to engaged in autobiographical memory recall, a pattern consistent with the view that the retrieval of autobiographical memories during mind-wandering creates a perceptually decoupled state (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib42">Schooler et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib46">Smallwood, 2013</xref>).</p><p>Experiment 2 used resting-state functional connectivity to establish that there is strong intrinsic coupling between regions of DMN relevant to reading and ventral visual cortex; in contrast, regions of core DMN, activated by autobiographical memory retrieval, showed reduced correlation with these ventral visual regions, compared with aspects of DMN linked to reading. This pattern suggests that the reduction of activity in ventral visual cortex observed in Experiment 1 was not an artefact of our task instructions which required participants to attend to autobiographical memories rather than textual input. Instead, the core DMN regions activated when we retrieve autobiographical memories are functionally distant from regions of ventral visual cortex important for reading comprehension. Moreover, individual differences in intrinsic connectivity associated with the state of mind-wandering during reading are consistent with this view. We found that, in individuals who remained focussed on reading and who had better comprehension, primary visual cortex showed stronger functional coupling to the aspects of DMN that support reading. For people who generated more off-task thought contents, these regions of visual cortex showed weaker functional coupling to reading-relevant DMN regions. This perceptual decoupling pattern was also seen in our task-based functional connectivity analysis of Experiment 1, since we found that decoupling of a reading-related DMN site to visual cortex was greater during the retrieval of autobiographical memories in the absence of sentences and when there was better focus on memory retrieval in the face of distracting semantic inputs. These converging lines of evidence demonstrate the importance of perceptual decoupling for mind-wandering during reading, which consequently disrupts the pattern of perceptual coupling that supports reading comprehension (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib44">Smallwood, 2011</xref>).</p><p>Our analyses have important implications for psychological theories regarding self-generated states such as mind-wandering, as well as for our understanding of the involvement of the DMN in human cognition. Psychologically, our study suggests that simply asking individuals to retrieve autobiographical information creates a perceptually decoupled state that is at odds with the comprehension of information from the external environment. This pattern is consistent with the view that perceptual decoupling is related to the persistence of self-generated mental content in consciousness (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib46">Smallwood, 2013</xref>). In the neural domain, our data suggests that mind-wandering while reading involves a shift in the balance of neural activity within the DMN, away from lateral temporal and prefrontal regions that are closely linked to regions of ventral visual cortex important for reading, and towards regions within the core of this system involved in supporting mental content that is unrelated to the external environment during autobiographical memory retrieval. In this context, it is worth noting that studies that have established the role of the DMN in explicit memory retrieval also show that this pattern is accompanied by the suppression of visual processing (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">Murphy et al., 2019</xref>). Furthermore, individuals with epilepsy who are impaired in the process of pattern separation necessary for accurate episodic memory retrieval show atypical suppression of brain activity in visual cortex during memory retrieval (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Li et al., 2021</xref>). The current data, therefore, provide novel support for the possibility that antagonistic activity patterns in the DMN and in sensory cortices may be important for features of memory retrieval to proceed in an effective manner.</p><p>More generally, our data add to growing evidence for a broad contribution of the DMN to features of human cognition. In particular, our findings are consistent with observations that the broader DMN can support apparently antagonistic states, particularly both perceptually coupled and decoupled modes of cognition. Initial focus on the DMN assumed that this system was primarily important for internally focused states. Recently, however, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib66">Yeshurun et al., 2021</xref> have argued that the DMN plays a key role in the integration of internal and external information in the service of aligning the perspectives of different individuals over time. Our data highlighting the role of the broader DMN in reading for comprehension is consistent with this perspective, as this mode of operation could help to create common ground between different individuals in their understanding of a narrative. However, the involvement of the same broad system in situations such as mind-wandering suggests that it can also lead to a breakdown in the common ground between individuals, in this case by impairing comprehension during reading. Both of these operational modes stem from topographic location of DMN at the end of sensory processing streams, such as the ventral visual stream. This allows this network to provide abstract representations of external information and, at the same time, the DMN’s functional and structural distance to unimodal sensory systems provides the opportunity for decoupled states to emerge, which support mental contents that are unrelated to external input (such as self-generated off-task states; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Margulies et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib49">Smallwood et al., 2021a</xref>).</p><p>Although different aspects of the DMN play distinctive roles in reading comprehension and autobiographical memory retrieval, there are still some neural similarities between these two mental states; since the lateral temporal and frontal regions within dorsomedial DMN activate in response to both tasks (i.e., identified by a formal conjunction across the contrast maps of each task over the letter string baseline; see <xref ref-type="fig" rid="app1fig4">Appendix 1—figure 4</xref>). Previous studies have shown the engagement of lateral temporal and inferior frontal cortex in both reading and memory recall (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Andrews-Hanna et al., 2014a</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Ferstl et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Lambon Ralph et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib55">Summerfield et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib56">Svoboda et al., 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib63">Yang et al., 2019</xref>). Given that both tasks involve semantic cognition (e.g. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Dehaene et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Graham et al., 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib52">Spitsyna et al., 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib56">Svoboda et al., 2006</xref>), this finding is consistent with prior work implicating lateral temporal cortex and inferior frontal gyrus in the representation and retrieval of heteromodal conceptual knowledge (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Badre et al., 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Binder et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Jefferies, 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Lambon Ralph et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">Noonan et al., 2013</xref>). In addition, we found that the regions important for reading comprehension activate not only when visual input is task-relevant (i.e., during reading for comprehension), but also when this input is irrelevant to the ongoing task (i.e., revealed by <italic>autobiographical memory retrieval with conflict &gt; autobiographical memory retrieval with no conflict</italic>; see <xref ref-type="fig" rid="app1fig5">Appendix 1—figure 5</xref>), and irrespective of task focus. In line with our findings, these reading-relevant regions may be more perceptually coupled supporting visual to conceptual knowledge mapping. In this way, they might be sensitive to situations in which meaning emerges in the external environment, even when the focus of attention is elsewhere.</p><p>Although our study provides important insight into how the occurrence of autobiographical mental content can derail our ability to make sense of the external environment, it also leaves open several important questions. First, in both Experiment 1, and in many examples of naturally occurring mind-wandering, the off-task mental contents may have greater relevance to the individual than information in the environment (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib41">Sanders et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib45">Smallwood et al., 2011</xref>), perhaps because these states rely on ventral regions of medial prefrontal cortex (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Konu et al., 2020</xref>) that are important for motivated states (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Kouneiher et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib40">Rushworth et al., 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib54">Stawarczyk and D’Argembeau, 2015</xref>). It is therefore unclear whether reading more engaging text would change the likelihood of off-task thoughts emerging, and the neural systems that are engaged during reading. To address this issue, it would be useful for future studies to explore the neural systems recruited by highly engaging and personally-relevant texts, to establish if these are more similar to those observed when reflecting on autobiographical memories. Second, differing from our current design, one’s naturalistic reading is self-paced and involves longer passages with a complex pattern of attentional focus on the text. People sometimes slow down or speed up their reading, as attention, interest or complexity wax and wane, and often, they re-read earlier parts of text. Although there are important discrepancies between the mind-wandering occurring during naturalistic reading and the design of Experiment 1, our study established important neural similarities between task-induced autobiographical memory (Experiment 1) and naturally occurring mind-wandering (Experiment 2) during reading. These similarities cannot be accounted for by differences between the experimental situations and therefore our study establishes important support for the process-occurrence view of self-generated states (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib46">Smallwood, 2013</xref>). Third, contemporary studies suggest that different types of self-generated thoughts have different neural correlates (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Karapanagiotidis et al., 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Mckeown et al., 2020</xref>). Accordingly, it is possible that certain features of naturally occurring off-task thought patterns could lead to greater or lesser disengagement from external input. This question could be readily addressed by combining multi-dimensional experience sampling (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib48">Smallwood et al., 2016</xref>) with brain activity recorded while individuals read.</p></sec><sec id="s4" sec-type="materials|methods"><title>Materials and methods</title><sec id="s4-1"><title>Participants</title><p>A total of 339 participants were recruited in this study. For Experiment 1, 29 undergraduate students were recruited (age-range 18–23, mean age ± SD = 20.14 ± 1.26, 6 males). For Experiment 2, we used two separate resting-state samples: one sample consisted of 244 participants (age-range 18–31, mean age ± SD = 20.73 ± 2.39, 77 males; three participants overlapped with Experiment 1), which was used to examine the intrinsic connectivity of DMN regions linked to reading and autobiographical memory retrieval. One participant was excluded from this analysis due to excessive head motion (i.e., mean head motion &gt; 0.4 mm). Another published dataset of 69 participants (age range 18–31, mean age ± SD = 19.87 ± 2.33, 26 males; without any participant overlap with the other two samples) was used to characterise the relationship of functional architecture of the DMN regions associated with reading and autobiographical memory retrieval and individual variation in naturally occurring mind-wandering reading, as measured in our prior study (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib67">Zhang et al., 2019</xref>).

These nouns were divided into two lists (i.e., 72 words for each task) that did not differ in terms of frequency (CELEX database; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Baayen et al., 1993</xref>), imageability (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Davis, 2005</xref>), and concreteness (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Brysbaert et al., 2014</xref>; <italic>p</italic> &gt; 0.1). The sentences were constructed by using these key words as a search term in Wikipedia to identify text that described largely unfamiliar facts about each item; in this way, the contents of these sentences were neutral in valence (Sentence Length: Mean ± <italic>SD</italic> = 20.04 ± 0.93 words). For example, “<italic>Posters are also used for reproductions of artwork, particularly famous works, and are low-cost compared to the original artwork”</italic> for the keyword POSTER<italic>, and “All mammals have some hair on their skin, even marine mammals like whales and dolphins, which appear to be hairless”</italic> for the keyword MAMMAL. These sentences and the autobiographical memory cues were then divided into three sets and assigned to different conditions (with this assignment counterbalanced across participants). The sentences were assigned to (1) <italic>Reading</italic> without conflict from memory recall; (2) <italic>Reading</italic> with conflict from memory recall, and (3) <italic>Memory Recall</italic> with conflict from concurrent sentence presentation. Similarly, the autobiographical memory cues were assigned to (1) <italic>Memory Recall</italic> without conflict from sentences and (2) <italic>Memory Recall</italic> with conflict from sentences, as well as (3) <italic>Reading</italic> with conflict from memory recall. In addition, the key words used in these conditions were matched on key psycholinguistic variables: they did not differ in lexical frequency, imageability, or concreteness (all <italic>F</italic> &lt; 1.07). In addition, all the words in the three sets of sentences were comparable across these variables (see <xref ref-type="table" rid="app1table1">Appendix 1—table 1</xref>; all <italic>F</italic> &lt; 1.40). Two additional cue words were created for task practice.</p></sec><sec id="s4-3"><title>Task procedure for reading and autobiographical memory retrieval task in Experiment 1</title><p>Testing occurred across two consecutive days. On Day 1, participants were asked to generate their own personal memories from cue words (e.g., Party) outside the scanner. They were asked to identify specific events that they were personally involved in and to provide as much detail about these events as they could, including when and where the event took place, who was involved in, what happened, and the duration. They were asked to type these details into a spreadsheet, which ensured that comparable information was recorded for different cue words.</p><p>On the following day, participants were asked to read sentences for comprehension, or to recall their generated personal memories inside the scanner. In reading trials, sentences were presented word by word, after either (1) an autobiographical memory cue word (e.g., Party), creating conflict between reading and personal memory retrieval, or (2) a letter string (e.g., XXX) allowing reading to take place in the absence of conflict from autobiographical memory. We controlled the duration of the sentences by presenting the words on 15 successive slides, combining short words on a single slide (e.g., <italic>have been</italic> or <italic>far better</italic>) or presenting articles and conjunctions together with nouns (e.g., <italic>the need; and toys</italic>). In memory recall trials, participants were asked to recall autobiographical memories during the presentation of either (1) an unrelated sentence, creating conflict from task-irrelevant semantic input, or (2) letter strings (e.g., XXX) allowing autobiographical memory to take place without distracting semantic input. As a control condition, meaningless letter strings (e.g., xxxxx) were presented. In order to ensure the participants were maintaining attention to the presented stimuli (even when these were irrelevant and creating competition), they were told to press a button when they noticed the colour of a word or letter string change to red. There were 3 trials out of 24 trials in each condition that involved responding in this way. Behavioural data for the colour change detection task are presented in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="app1fig1">Appendix 1—figure 1</xref>.</p><p>As shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1</xref>, each trial started with a fixation cross (1–3 s) in the centre of the screen. Then either an autobiographical memory cue word or a letter string appeared for 2 s. During the presentation of the cue word, participants were asked to bring to mind their personal memories related to this item. Next, the task instruction (i.e., READING or MEMORY RECALL) was presented for 1 s. Following that, words from sentences or letter strings were presented, with each one lasting 600ms. On memory recall trials, participants were asked to keep thinking about their autobiographical memory, as much detail as possible, until the end of the trial.</p><p>After each trial, participants were asked to rate several dimensions of their experience. In the reading task, they were asked about task focus, their comprehension, and conceptual familiarity. For autobiographical memory retrieval trials, they were asked about task focus, vividness, and how consistent their retrieval was to the memory they specified day before. The three rating questions were sequentially presented after a jittered fixation interval lasting 1–3 s. Participants were required to rate these characteristics on a scale of 1 (not at all) to 7 (very well) within 4 s for each question. There were no ratings for the letter string trials.</p><p>Stimuli were presented in four runs, with each containing 30 trials: six trials in each of the four experimental conditions, and six letter string trials. Each run lasted 12.85 min, and each reading or memory recall trial lasted in the range of 26.2–29.9 s with an average of 28.0 s, while each letter string trial lasted from 13.0 to 15.0 s with an average of 14.0 s. In addition, trials were presented in a pseudorandom order to ensure trials from the same experimental condition were not consecutively presented more than three times.</p><p>Before entering the scanner, participants completed a 6-min task to test their memory of the personal events they generated the day before scanning. They were also asked to review their generated memories and refresh themselves with the ones that were not well remembered. Next, they completed an eight-trial practice block containing all types of conditions to ensure fully understanding of the task requirements.</p></sec><sec id="s4-4"><title>Behavioural assessment of mind-wandering reading in Experiment 2</title><p>This dataset was used in our previous study (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib67">Zhang et al., 2019</xref>). Participants were asked to complete a battery of behavioural assessments examining their reading comprehension and off-task thought, while they read a passage about the topic of geology. During reading, they were required to note down any moments when they noticed they had stopped paying attention to the meaning of the text. After they finished reading, they were asked to answer 17 open-ended questions to assess their comprehension of the text, without being able to refer back to the text. A self-reported measurement, with 22 questions about the content of thoughts (e.g., <italic>I thought about personal worries</italic>), was used to assess off-task behaviour during the reading task (see <xref ref-type="fig" rid="app1fig6">Appendix 1—figure 6</xref>). This analysis revealed that people were thinking about autobiographical memories (past events) alongside future events, other people and emotions, when they reported mind-wandering during reading. In this way, both off-task thoughts (i.e., frequency and the content of these experiences) and reading comprehension were assessed.</p></sec><sec id="s4-5"><title>Neuroimaging data acquisition</title><p>Structural and functional data were acquired using a 3T GE HDx Excite MRI scanner utilizing an eight-channel phased array head coil.

All processing was performed via micapipe, an openly accessible processing pipeline for multimodal MRI data (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://micapipe.readthedocs.io/">https://micapipe.readthedocs.io/</ext-link>). In brief, micapipe combines procedures from several software packages, including tools from AFNI, FSL, FreeSurfer, mrtrix, and ANTs. Cortical surfaces were generated by applying FreeSurfer to T1w scans (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Dale et al., 1999</xref>), images were non-linearly aligned to MNI152 space using ANTs, and tissue types segmented using FSL FAST. The diffusion weighted imaging (DWI) data were pre-processed using MRtrix (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib58">Tournier et al., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib57">Tournier et al., 2012</xref>). DWI data was denoised, underwent b0 intensity normalisation, and were corrected for susceptibility distortion, head motion, and eddy currents using a reverse phase encoding from two b = 0 s/mm2 volumes. Required anatomical features for tractography processing (i.e., FSL-based tissue type segmentations) were co-registered to native DWI space using an affine transformation implemented in ANTs. Diffusion processing and tractography were performed in native DWI space. We performed anatomically-constrained tractography using tissue types (cortical and subcortical grey matter, white matter, cerebrospinal fluid) segmented from each participant’s pre-processed T1w images registered to native DWI space. We estimated multi-shell and multi-tissue response functions and performed constrained spherical-deconvolution and intensity normalisation. To approximate ROI-to-ROI structural connectivity, we applied tckgen with a setting of 100,000 streamlines between the visual network and reading/AM components of the DMN in diffusion space, followed by generation of a tract-weighted image. Tract-weighted images were then mapped to MNI152 space using the existing co-registration/registration functions, and averaged across subjects to approximate consistent tracts across individuals. This analysis revealed that there are structural connectivity pathways from visual areas to DMN regions supporting reading and personal memory retrieval.

Your article has been reviewed by 2 peer reviewers, and the evaluation has been overseen by a Reviewing Editor and Chris Baker as the Senior Editor. The following individual involved in review of your submission has agreed to reveal their identity: Jessica Andrews-Hanna (Reviewer #1).</p><p>The reviewers have discussed their reviews with one another, and the Reviewing Editor has drafted this to help you prepare a revised submission.</p><p>Essential revisions:</p><p>1. The details of the Experiment 1 design are not fully clear when the Experiment 1 results are presented and Figure 1 is introduced. It could increase readability to provide an overview of the task before describing the results. It would also be helpful to include some details of the analysis in the main text, such as whether trials with color changes were included in analyses.</p><p>2. The motion exclusion criteria for Experiment 2 datasets 1 and 2 was &gt;.4mm mean frame-to-frame displacement (I believe after censoring). This is high, as &gt;.2 mm or &gt;.15 mm is more typical. Are results consistent when more stringent motion criteria are applied? Related to this, because motion can be a significant confound in functional connectivity studies, did the individual differences analysis account for differences in head motion between individuals?</p><p>3. Although the whole-brain, data-driven analysis approaches used in both experiments have benefits, they make connections between the studies somewhat challenging to follow. For example, it is not readily apparent how precisely the findings agree across datasets because the regions described in each dataset partially but do not fully overlap, and it's not clear what degree of overlap should be considered a replication or what the likelihood of seeing that degree of overlap by chance would be. It could be a stronger, clearer test of the hypotheses proposed to use the same regions of interest across studies. For example, do the same regions that show greater activity during reading than memory show strong connectivity in Experiment 2 dataset 1 and do those same connections scale with propensity to mind wandering and reading comprehension in Experiment 2 dataset 2?</p><p>4. Related to the point above, Experiment 2 data show strong resting-state functional connectivity between DMN regions linked to reading and visual ROIs, and weaker functional connectivity between DMN regions linked to memory and these visual ROIs. Are these same functional connections modulated by task condition in Experiment 1? It would strengthen the argument that DMN-visual cortex coupling is disrupted by mind wandering during reading to show that the exact same ROIs are more strongly functionally connected during reading than memory retrieval.</p><p>5. The individual differences analysis in Experiment 2 dataset 2 is very interesting but doesn't provide conclusive support for the hypothesis that decoupling between the DMN and visual regions is causally related to mind wandering. Rather, the result suggests that the strength of a functional connection within the DMN scales with self-reported mind wandering. A more direct test of the hypothesis proposed in the introduction would be relating Experiment 2 dataset 2 participants' functional connectivity between DMN and visual ROIs (the same ROIs defined in Experiment 1) to their self-reported mind wandering. The proposed theory should predict a relationship between greater DMN-visual ROI connectivity, less propensity to mind wander, and better reading comprehension. Even in the absence of a more direct test of the hypothesis, it would strengthen the observed result if it were replicated in subsets of the data or a new dataset given the exploratory nature of the analysis.</p><p>6. The results from Experiment 2's analysis of dataset 2 overlap with findings from Zhang et al., (2019, Scientific Reports) using the same dataset. Although the fact that these data were previously analyzed is helpfully noted in the text, it should also be clarified that paper related individual differences in DMN-visual cortex functional connectivity to individual differences in mind wandering during reading. Thus the analysis of this dataset in the current manuscript is very similar to this previously published analysis. The distinction between these analyses should be clarified in the text.</p><p>7. The manuscript would benefit from more discussion of the many discrepancies between mind wandering during naturalistic reading and the authors' current design. Also, in light of these discrepancies, the conclusions (while possibly accurate) do not seem to be directly supported by the data and should be discussed in a more tentative way.</p><p>8. The authors should discuss the null &quot;conflict&quot; findings in the discussion, and also speculate as to why they did not observe positive relationships with task focus in regions related to reading. Additionally, it would be helpful if the authors were to specify which task contrasts were used to create Figure 3C.</p><p>9. The manuscript often describes separate DMN subdivisions that support reading versus autobiographical memory, but glosses over possible similarities between the two tasks. I would like to see the authors raise the issue of possible neural similarities between the two tasks in the discussion, and clarify that when discussing neural differences, such differences emerged from direct contrasts between the two tasks.</p><p>10. I would like to see the authors cite earlier meta-analyses, such as those by Binder et al., 2009 and Yang et al., 2019. In addition, other published work linking reading to the DMN and the dorsal medial subsystem seems important to cite as well, including Andrews-Hanna, Smallwood and Spreng, 2014 who noted a link to reading in their Neurosynth meta-analysis of default mode subsystems, as well as a more recent task-related meta-analysis quantifying the involvement of the dorsal medial subsystem (Yang et al., 2019).</p><p>11. I would like to see more discussion surrounding the resting state individual difference relationships between mind-wandering during reading and connectivity with the dorsal occipital cortex. Since this region was activated in the autobiographical memory task, I suspect the authors hypothesized the opposite relationship as to that which they observed.</p><p>12. Finally, I would like to see more detail presented on the nature of the expository text itself. Perhaps the authors could include a few example stimuli in the manuscript? Are the sentences neutral in valence? Is the text interesting to most participants, or was it meant to be boring? Also, I can't seem to find how long the duration of the memory retrieval and reading components of the trials were, on average. Could the authors add this information into the methods?</p><p>Relevant References:</p><p>Andrews-Hanna, J. R., Smallwood, J., and Spreng, R. N. (2014).

To control the impact of head motion, factors that are identified as potential confounding effects to the estimated BOLD signal are estimated and removed separately for each voxel and for each subject. This means that, except for the removal of participants with excessive head motion, another two confounding effects related to head motion were also included to account for its negative influence: (i) one was estimated subject-motion parameters (Friston et al., 1995) in order to minimize motion related BOLD variability, (ii) another one was identified outlier scans or scrubbing (Power et al., 2014) to remove any influence of these outlier scans on the BOLD signal. These potential confounding effects were included as nuisance parameters into the model in the denoising step. CONN uses the standard CompCor approach (Behzadi, Restom, Liau, and Liu, 2007), removing all of these effects to obtain a clean signal for the following analyses. Global signal regression was not performed because CompCor can effectively account for subject movement effects and other sources of noise in the BOLD signal (Behzadi et al., 2007; Muschelli et al., 2014). In this way, our group-level analysis which was performed based on the pre-processed and denoised signal has accounted for both motion and other sources of noise. We have further clarified these aspects in the Methods.</p><p>In addition, we have re-run all the resting-state functional connectivity analyses in Experiment 2 using a more stringent head motion criterion as you suggested (i.e., mean framewise displacement &gt;.2 mm), leading to the exclusion of 5 participants in Experiment 2 Dataset 1 (N = 239 after removal) and 2 participants in Dataset 2 (N = 67 after removal). The resulting patterns of these two datasets remained the same as when more lenient criteria for head motion were used: In Experiment 2 Dataset 1, the DMN seed linked to reading exhibited stronger functional coupling with ventral visual cortex relative to the DMN seed linked to autobiographical memory retrieval (see Appendix 1-Figure 7 A) and the “task-rest” conjunction also established that the functional connectivity of the seed linked to reading is mirrored by their joint activation during reading (see Appendix 1-Figure 7 B). For the mind-wandering during reading individual difference analysis, for individuals with better reading comprehension and less generated mind-wandering contents, there was also greater functional coupling of the DMN seed linked to reading to the regions of left (corrected cluster-size p-FWE &lt;.001) and right primary visual cortex (corrected cluster-size p-FWE = .002), as well as postcentral gyrus (corrected cluster-size p-FWE = .005; see Appendix 1-Figure 7 C). We have presented the results using these stricter exclusion criteria in the Appendix 1.</p><p>Clarification of the control of head motion in the Methods section on Page 27:</p><p>“Pre-processing steps automatically created three first-level covariates: a realignment covariate containing the six rigid-body parameters characterising the estimated subject motion for each participant, a scrubbing covariate containing the potential outliers scans for each participant (i.e., identified through the artefact detection algorithm included in CONN, with intermediate settings: scans for each participant were flagged as outliers based on scan-by-scan change in global signal above z = 5, subject motion threshold above 0.9 mm, differential motion and composite motion exceeding 97% percentile in the normative sample), and a covariate containing quality assurance (QA) parameters (e.g., the global signal change from one scan to another and the framewise displacement) for each participant.

We have now reported functional connectivity analyses using the same regions of interest across studies to show the extent to which patterns are replicated across datasets. In Experiment 2 Dataset 1, the reading and autobiographical memory DMN peak activation sites from Experiment 1 were used as seeds in an analysis of intrinsic connectivity, since these locations represent the maximal differential activation relating to each specific task state. Using these seeds, we performed a whole-brain seed-to-voxel connectivity analyses plus an ROI-based analysis to examine whether there was difference in the connectivity of these DMN nodes to the visual cluster that was more engaged in the reading task in Experiment 1. In this way, we can maintain the benefits of data-driven analyses while making it easier to relate the findings across datasets. In Experiment 2 Dataset 2, we examined the relationship between the intrinsic connectivity of the same DMN seeds (derived from Experiment 1) with individual variance in naturalistic mind-wandering during reading. This also recovered a cluster in visual cortex. Following your other suggestion below, we then examined functional connectivity in a task context (using data from Experiment 1) to establish whether coupling between the DMN seeds and the mind-wandering visual cluster from Experiment 2 was reduced when participants focussed on autobiographical memory. The results of these new analyses are summarised below.</p><p>For Experiment 2 Dataset 1, we found, as expected, that the DMN peak seed linked to reading showed greater intrinsic connectivity to ventral visual cortex than the DMN seed associated with autobiographical memory retrieval. A follow-up ROI analysis revealed that there was stronger connectivity at rest between Reading DMN-to-Reading visual areas than Autobiographical memory DMN-to-Reading visual areas. In this analysis, we used a Reading visual ROI (i.e., a sphere based on the peak visual activation in the task contrast of Reading &gt; Autobiographical memory retrieval, as shown in Figure 2A; MNI coordinates: -32, -92, -10) and extracted functional connectivity for each participant, for each DMN seed. Paired samples <italic>t</italic>-tests revealed stronger intrinsic connectivity between the Reading DMN and Reading visual cortex than the Autobiographical memory DMN to Reading visual cortex (Reading DMN-to-Reading visual: Mean ± SD = .02 ±.14, Autobiographical memory DMN-to-Reading visual: Mean ± SD = -.01 ±.14; <italic>t</italic>(242) = 2.78, <italic>p</italic> = .006), providing further evidence that the same regions showing stronger activation during reading comprehension than memory retrieval also exhibit stronger intrinsic connectivity at rest.</p><p>For the results of Experiment 2 Dataset 2, we found that individuals with more off-task thought contents and poorer comprehension had weaker connectivity between the DMN seed linked to reading and primary visual cortex. This pattern is informative since it suggests that perceptual decoupling is related to individual variation in mind-wandering during reading; importantly, it generalises our experimental paradigm to an ecologically valid situation. To better understand whether this identified “mind-wandering-related” visual cluster behaves in a similar way during the experimentally-mimicked experiences of mind-wandering reading, we then performed psychophysiological interaction (PPI) analysis (i.e., task-based functional connectivity) using the Reading and Autobiographical memory DMN seeds. For each participant, the functional connectivity of each seed with this “mind-wandering” visual ROI (created based on peak visual activation in Experiment 2 Dataset 2; see Figure 4C) was extracted for each experimental condition, as well as the Task Focus effect of each experimental condition (i.e., the parametric regressors of Task Focus). This analysis revealed that the functional decoupling of Reading DMN to this “mind-wandering-related” visual site was greater (i) during the retrieval of personally-relevant memories in the absence of sentences, and (ii) when the task focus was higher on memory retrieval but when there was conflict from irrelevant semantic inputs. The similar perceptual decoupling pattern in both resting-state and task-state functional connectivity highlights the importance of perceptual decoupling when internal memory retrieval competes with reading comprehension.</p><p>Taken together, this converging lines of evidence from Experiment 2 suggest that (i) the generation of internal thoughts relies on DMN regions that functionally decouple from visual areas important for reading, and (ii) this consequently creates a perceptually-decoupled mental state that disrupts ongoing reading comprehension. We have updated all of these results in this revision. Please see below for details.</p><p>The results of these new analyses in Experiment 2 on Page 11-17:</p><p>“Experiment 2</p><p>Experiment 1 established that our paradigm captured the expected mutual inhibition between reading and autobiographical memory retrieval (Figure 1) and found that both states depend on activity within distinct regions within the DMN (Figure 2 and 3).

Related to the point above, Experiment 2 data show strong resting-state functional connectivity between DMN regions linked to reading and visual ROIs, and weaker functional connectivity between DMN regions linked to memory and these visual ROIs. Are these same functional connections modulated by task condition in Experiment 1? It would strengthen the argument that DMN-visual cortex coupling is disrupted by mind wandering during reading to show that the exact same ROIs are more strongly functionally connected during reading than memory retrieval.</p></disp-quote><p>Thank you for your valuable suggestion. As mentioned above, we have performed PPI analysis to examine whether DMN-to-Visual decoupling is modulated by our task manipulations using the Reading/Autobiographical memory DMN peak seeds. To extract DMN-to-Visual connectivity values, we created the visual ROI based on the peak visual activation identified in Experiment 2 Dataset 2 (as Figure 4C). This visual site is associated with individual differences in naturally-occurring mind-wandering during reading. The exploration of the decoupling from this “mind-wandering” relevant visual site would allow us to examine to what extent this pattern behaves in a similar way in the experiment simulating mind-wandering during reading. The results suggested that there is greater Reading DMN-to-Visual decoupling during the retrieval of autobiographical memories in the absence of semantic inputs and when task focus is greater for internally-generated thoughts instead of irrelevant semantic inputs. These findings support our argument that the functional coupling of reading-related DMN and visual cortex is disrupted by mind-wandering since the retrieval of autobiographical mental content creates a perceptually decoupled state that disrupts ongoing reading comprehension.</p><p>In this analysis, two PPI models were established using the Reading and Autobiographical memory DMN seeds to estimate the task-based functional connectivity of these regions in DMN with visual cortex in each experimental condition. An ROI-based approach was applied to extract the functional connectivity of Reading/Autobiographical memory DMN seeds to the “mind-wandering” visual ROI for each experimental condition (i.e., main effects of task), as well as for the parametric effect of Task Focus in each condition, for each participant. For each seed model, a 2 (Task: Reading vs. Autobiographical memory) by 2 (Conflict: No conflict vs. Conflict) repeated-measures Analysis of Variance (ANOVA) was performed to examine the differences in functional connectivity across conditions.</p><p>For the Reading DMN seed, and examining main effects of condition, the effect of Task approached significance, <italic>F</italic>(1,27) = 3.51, <italic>p</italic> = .072, <italic>η</italic><sub><italic>p</italic></sub><sup><italic>2</italic></sup> = .12.

Simple effects tests revealed a significant main effect of Task in the absence of conflict, suggesting stronger functional coupling of Reading DMN to visual areas during reading comprehension.

Simple effects tests revealed a significant main effect of Task in the conflict condition, suggesting greater reading DMN-to-Visual coupling when participants were more focussed on reading comprehension despite distracting autobiographical memory cues. No effects were found for the Autobiographical memory DMN seed model. All of these additional PPI analyses are described in the Results section of Experiment 2, for the details of updated PPI results please see responses to point 3. We have also added a section to explain how these PPI models were set up in the Methods section.</p><p>The explanation of the setup of PPI models in the Methods section on Page 29:</p><p>“Psychophysiological interaction (PPI) analysis in Experiment 2: In order to understand whether the perceptual decoupling pattern at rest related to individual differences in mind-wandering identified in Experiment 2 also emerges in experimentally-mimicked mind-wandering during reading, we conducted PPI analysis.

The individual differences analysis in Experiment 2 dataset 2 is very interesting but doesn't provide conclusive support for the hypothesis that decoupling between the DMN and visual regions is causally related to mind wandering. Rather, the result suggests that the strength of a functional connection within the DMN scales with self-reported mind wandering. A more direct test of the hypothesis proposed in the introduction would be relating Experiment 2 dataset 2 participants' functional connectivity between DMN and visual ROIs (the same ROIs defined in Experiment 1) to their self-reported mind wandering. The proposed theory should predict a relationship between greater DMN-visual ROI connectivity, less propensity to mind wander, and better reading comprehension. Even in the absence of a more direct test of the hypothesis, it would strengthen the observed result if it were replicated in subsets of the data or a new dataset given the exploratory nature of the analysis.</p></disp-quote><p>Thank you very much for your suggestions. As we mentioned in the responses to point 3, we found that the functional decoupling between DMN linked to reading and primary visual area is associated with individual differences in mind-wandering during reading when using the Reading/Autobiographical memory peak seeds. Particularly, there is greater reading DMN-to-visual coupling for individuals with better reading comprehension and less generated contents of off-task thoughts (i.e., mind-wandering content metric, including autobiographical memory). This finding provides more conclusive support for our argument that mind-wandering elicits a perceptual decoupling state that disrupts ongoing reading comprehension. Importantly, this finding establishes a generalisation of our results from experimentally manipulated experiences of mind-wandering in reading: similar effects occur during a more naturalistic experience in the laboratory, showing our experimental manipulation mimics key processes engaged during mind-wandering in reading.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>6. The results from Experiment 2's analysis of dataset 2 overlap with findings from Zhang et al., (2019, Scientific Reports) using the same dataset. Although the fact that these data were previously analyzed is helpfully noted in the text, it should also be clarified that paper related individual differences in DMN-visual cortex functional connectivity to individual differences in mind wandering during reading. Thus the analysis of this dataset in the current manuscript is very similar to this previously published analysis. The distinction between these analyses should be clarified in the text.</p></disp-quote><p>We have now clarified that we also found a DMN-to-Visual decoupling effect associated with individual differences in mind-wandering experience while reading in our previous study (Zhang et al., 2019). In our current analysis, we performed a similar analysis to this previous study, except that we used the Reading/Autobiographical memory DMN peak sites as seeds to drive these functional connectivity analyses. Though both our current Reading DMN and previous DMN seeds are located in the left lateral temporal DMN regions, they are in different locations. The findings from our current study are also consistent with our previous findings, since we found that there was greater decoupling of reading-related DMN from primary visual cortex for individuals reporting more off-task thought contents and poorer reading comprehension. These converging lines of evidence demonstrate the importance of reductions of reading-related DMN-to-Visual coupling for the occurrence of mind-wandering during reading. We have discussed these points in the Results section in this revised manuscript.</p><p>Revised text on Page 13-14:</p><p><bold>“</bold>Our second analysis examined how the functional architecture of these DMN seeds associated with reading and autobiographical memory retrieval was related to individual variation in naturally occurring mind-wandering during reading as measured in our prior study (Zhang et al., 2019). […] When seeding the reading DMN peak, the contrast of reading comprehension over mind-wandering content revealed regions of left primary visual cortex (corrected cluster-size p-FWE = .004) and right primary visual cortex (corrected cluster-size p-FWE = .004), as well as postcentral gyrus (corrected cluster-size p-FWE = .006), which showed stronger connectivity for individuals with better reading comprehension and less mind-wandering content reported in a questionnaire (see Figure 4C), in line with our previous findings (Zhang et al., 2019).<bold>”</bold></p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>7. The manuscript would benefit from more discussion of the many discrepancies between mind wandering during naturalistic reading and the authors' current design. Also, in light of these discrepancies, the conclusions (while possibly accurate) do not seem to be directly supported by the data and should be discussed in a more tentative way.</p></disp-quote><p>In this revision we have more carefully evaluated the similarities and differences between the results found in naturalistic reading and in our experimental study. Although we found similar connectivity patterns in these contexts, some important differences remain. First, the reading task in our current paradigm was presented in a fixed-paced manner, and participants read short factual-based text. Naturalistic reading involves a self-paced process, longer passages and a much more complex pattern of attentional focus on the text, with the pace sometimes slowing down or speeding up as one's attention, interest, or the complexity of the text waxes and wanes. In addition, people also often go back to earlier parts of text during reading. Moreover, mind-wandering occurs spontaneously in naturalistic reading which is difficult to capture, and for this reason we pitted these two mental states in competition, deliberately probing its occurrence during reading comprehension. We have now discussed these points as limitations in the Discussion section, however, it is important to note that a unique feature of our study is that we were able to generalise from constrained tasks in the scanner, to a more naturalistic situation.</p><p>Revised Discussion on Page 21-22:</p><p>“Second, differing from our current design, one’s naturalistic reading is self-paced and involves longer passages with a complex pattern of attentional focus on the text. People sometimes slow down or speed up their reading, as attention, interest or complexity wax and wane, and often, they re-read earlier parts of text. Though there are important discrepancies between the mind-wandering occurring during naturalistic reading and the design of Experiment 1, our study established important neural similarities between task-induced autobiographical memory (Experiment 1) and naturally occurring mind-wandering (Experiment 2) during reading. These similarities cannot be accounted for by differences between the experimental situations and therefore our study establishes important support for the process-occurrence view of self-generated states (Smallwood, 2013).”</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>8. The authors should discuss the null &quot;conflict&quot; findings in the discussion, and also speculate as to why they did not observe positive relationships with task focus in regions related to reading. Additionally, it would be helpful if the authors were to specify which task contrasts were used to create Figure 3C.</p></disp-quote><p>For the conflict effect, we did not find any conflict effects for reading, also no significant parametric effect of Task Focus in the reading-related DMN regions. The absence of these effects might relate to the specific functional role of these reading-related regions in semantic processing. This is because, for the effect of Conflict in the memory retrieval task (i.e., autobiographical memory retrieval with Conflict &gt; autobiographical memory retrieval with no conflict), we found stronger activation in the regions that were identified as key sites for reading comprehension by the Reading &gt; autobiographical memory retrieval contrast (see Appendix 1-Figure 5). This finding suggests that the lateral temporal DMN, along the ventral visual cortex, are more perceptually coupled, with stronger activation in response to meaningful visual inputs (sentences versus letter strings in autobiographical memory retrieval conditions), regardless of whether the perceptual input is relevant to the ongoing task or not. Consequently, these regions may be able to detect situations in which meaning emerges in the environment, even when the focus of attention is elsewhere. In other words, its responsiveness to external meaningful inputs might be more automatic and effortless, without a demanding control of attentional allocation. Therefore, we did not see any conflict or Task focus effect in these regions. We have further discussed that in this revision.</p><p>In addition, the effects of Task Focus identified in Figure 3C were relative to the implicit baseline (i.e., the first fixation interval across trials). We have also clarified that in the Figure caption now.</p><p>Further Discussion of null conflict effects on Page 21:</p><p>“In addition, we found that the regions important for reading comprehension activate not only when visual input is task-relevant (i.e., during reading for comprehension), but also when this input is irrelevant to the ongoing task (i.e., revealed by autobiographical memory retrieval with Conflict &gt; autobiographical memory retrieval with no conflict; see Appendix 1-Figure 5), and irrespective of task focus. In line with our findings, these reading-relevant regions may be more perceptually-coupled supporting visual to conceptual knowledge mapping. In this way, they might be sensitive to situations in which meaning emerges in the external environment, even when the focus of attention is elsewhere.”</p><p>Clarification of the baseline for Figure 3C in figure caption:</p><p>“(C) Task focus effects in reading (red; negative correlation with task focus) and autobiographical memory recall task (blue; positive correlation with task focus), relative to the implicit baseline (i.e., the first fixation interval).”</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>9. The manuscript often describes separate DMN subdivisions that support reading versus autobiographical memory, but glosses over possible similarities between the two tasks. I would like to see the authors raise the issue of possible neural similarities between the two tasks in the discussion, and clarify that when discussing neural differences, such differences emerged from direct contrasts between the two tasks.</p></disp-quote><p>We did examine the brain regions activated in both reading comprehension and autobiographical memory retrieval tasks. We computed a formal conjunction across the contrast maps of each task over the letter string baseline and established that reading and autobiographical memory retrieval elicited activation in the dorsal medial DMN subsystem, associated with semantic cognition (Badre et al., 2005; Jefferies 2013; Lambon Ralph et al., 2017), as well as in visual regions. Previous studies have shown the engagement of lateral temporal cortex in both reading and memory recall (Svoboda et al., 2006; Ferstl et al., 2008; Summerfield et al., 2009; Andrews-Hanna, Saxe, et al., 2014; Lambon Ralph et al., 2017), since both of these two tasks involve semantic retrieval (e.g., Dehaene, Cohen, Morais, and Kolinsky, 2015; Graham, Lee, Brett, and Patterson, 2003; Spitsyna, Warren, Scott, Turkheimer, and Wise, 2006; Svoboda et al., 2006). The task overlap in these DMN regions was left-lateralised, in line with expectations for a semantic retrieval network (Noonan et al., 2013; Hurley et al., 2015; Rice et al., 2015; Gonzalez Alam et al., 2019; Jackson 2020). We have discussed the commonalities in brain activation between these two tasks in the Discussion section now, and have also clarified that the neural differences emerging from direct contrasts of these tasks. In addition, we have also presented the results of our conjunction analysis of Reading and Autobiographical memory in the Appendix 1.</p><p>Further Discussion of commonalities in brain activation between these two tasks on Page 20-21:</p><p>“Although different aspects of the DMN play distinctive roles in reading comprehension and autobiographical memory retrieval, there are still some neural similarities between these two mental states; since the lateral temporal and frontal regions within dorsomedial DMN activate in response to both tasks (i.e., identified by a formal conjunction across the contrast maps of each task over the letter string baseline; see Appendix 1-Figure 4). Previous studies have shown the engagement of lateral temporal and inferior frontal cortex in both reading and memory recall (Andrews-Hanna, Saxe, and Yarkoni, 2014; Ferstl, Neumann, Bogler, and Von Cramon, 2008; Lambon Ralph et al., 2017; Summerfield, Hassabis, and Maguire, 2009; Svoboda, McKinnon, and Levine, 2006; Yang et al., 2019).

I would like to see the authors cite earlier meta-analyses, such as those by Binder et al., 2009 and Yang et al., 2019. In addition, other published work linking reading to the DMN and the dorsal medial subsystem seems important to cite as well, including Andrews-Hanna, Smallwood and Spreng, 2014 who noted a link to reading in their Neurosynth meta-analysis of default mode subsystems, as well as a more recent task-related meta-analysis quantifying the involvement of the dorsal medial subsystem (Yang et al., 2019).</p></disp-quote><p>Thank you for raising our attention to these very relevant references.

Finally, I would like to see more detail presented on the nature of the expository text itself. Perhaps the authors could include a few example stimuli in the manuscript?

As we discussed, the type of sentence contents might also be a potential factor affecting the likelihood to which the mind-wandering occurs during reading, such as reading factual sentences vs. personally-relevant sentences, which might consequently reveal a neural pattern different from what we found using factual sentences.
