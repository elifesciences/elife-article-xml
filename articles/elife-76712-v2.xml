question is what role axonal compartmentalization plays. Axonal compartmentalization may enable localized, presynaptic plasticity to alter neuronal output in a flexible, experience-dependent manner. Here, we show that olfactory learning generates compartmentalized, bidirectional plasticity of acetylcholine release that varies across the longitudinal compartments of <italic>Drosophila</italic> mushroom body (MB) axons. The directionality of the learning-induced plasticity depends on the valence of the learning event (aversive vs. appetitive), varies linearly across proximal to distal compartments following appetitive conditioning, and correlates with learning-induced changes in downstream mushroom body output neurons (MBONs) that modulate behavioral action selection. Potentiation of acetylcholine release was dependent on the Ca<sub>V</sub>2.1 calcium channel subunit <italic>cacophony</italic>. In addition, contrast between the positive conditioned stimulus and other odors required the inositol triphosphate receptor, which maintained responsivity to odors upon repeated presentations, preventing adaptation. Downstream from the MB, a set of MBONs that receive their input from the Î³3 MB compartment were required for normal appetitive learning, suggesting that they represent a key node through which reward learning influences decision-making. These data demonstrate that learning drives valence-correlated, compartmentalized, bidirectional potentiation, and depression of synaptic neurotransmitter release, which rely on distinct mechanisms and are distributed across axonal compartments in a learning circuit.</p></abstract><kwd-group kwd-group-type="author-keywords"><kwd>synaptic</kwd><kwd>potentiation</kwd><kwd>IP3R</kwd><kwd>habituation</kwd><kwd>depression</kwd><kwd>cav2</kwd></kwd-group><kwd-group kwd-group-type="research-organism"><title>Research organism</title><kwd><italic>D. melanogaster</italic></kwd></kwd-group><funding-group><award-group id="fund1"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000002</institution-id><institution>National Institutes of Health</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>R01NS097237</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Tomchik</surname><given-names>Seth M</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund2"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000002</institution-id><institution>National Institutes of Health</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>R01NS114403</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Tomchik</surname><given-names>Seth M</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund3"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000002</institution-id><institution>National Institutes of Health</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>R00MH092294</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Tomchik</surname><given-names>Seth M</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund4"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100001391</institution-id><institution>Whitehall Foundation</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>2014-12-31</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Tomchik</surname><given-names>Seth M</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund5"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000002</institution-id><institution>National Institutes of Health</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>R35NS097224</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Davis</surname><given-names>Ronald L</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund6"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution>Beijing Municipal Science &amp;

However, anatomical and physiological compartmentalization of axons has been recently documented in neurons from worms through mammals (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Boto et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Cohn et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Hendricks et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib60">Rowan et al., 2016</xref>). How axonal compartmentalization influences information flow across neuronal circuits and modulates behavioral outcomes is not understood. One functional role for axonal compartmentalization may be to enable localized, presynaptic plasticity to alter output from select axon compartments in a flexible, experience-dependent manner. This would vastly enhance the neuronâs flexibility and computational capabilities. A potential function of such compartmentalization would allow independent modulation of axonal segments and/or synaptic release sites by biologically salient events, such as sensory stimuli that drive learning.</p><p>The anatomical organization of the <italic>Drosophila</italic> mushroom body (MB) makes it an exemplary test bed to study how sensory information is processed during learning and rerouted to alter behavioral outcomes. The MB encodes odor in sparse representations across the intrinsic MB neurons, Kenyon cells (KCs), which are arranged in several parallel sets. They project axons in fasciculated bundles into several anatomically distinct, but spatially adjacent lobes (Î±/Î², Î±â²/Î²â², and Î³) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Crittenden et al., 1998</xref>). KC axons are longitudinally subdivided into discrete tiled compartments (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Aso et al., 2014a</xref>). Each compartment receives afferent neuromodulatory input from unique dopaminergic neurons (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Aso et al., 2014a</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib47">Mao and Davis, 2009</xref>), and innervates unique efferent mushroom body output neurons (MBONs) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Aso et al., 2014a</xref>). Each set of dopaminergic neurons plays an individual role in learning, with some modulating aversive learning (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib47">Mao and Davis, 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib64">Schroll et al., 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib65">Schwaerzel et al., 2003</xref>), others modulating reward learning (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib44">Liu et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib79">Yamagata et al., 2015</xref>), and a third class modulating memory strength without driving behavioral valence (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Boto et al., 2019</xref>). Similarly, each MBON has a unique effect on behavioral approach and avoidance, with some biasing the animal to approach, others biasing the animal to avoidance, and some having no known effect (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Aso et al., 2014b</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib55">Perisse et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib58">PlaÃ§ais et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib66">SÃ©journÃ© et al., 2011</xref>).</p><p>A major question in learning and memory is how presynaptic plasticity contributes to reweighting the flow of sensory signals across each of the downstream âapproachâ or âavoidanceâ circuits, altering action selection and memory retrieval. In naÃ¯ve conditions, <italic>Drosophila</italic> dopaminergic circuits modulate cAMP in a compartmentalized fashion along the MB axons (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Boto et al., 2014</xref>). This compartmentalized dopaminergic signaling can independently modulate Ca<sup>2+</sup> responses in each compartment, as well as the responses of the downstream valence-coding MBONs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Cohn et al., 2015</xref>). Presynaptic plasticity within each KC compartment likely contributes to the changes in downstream MBON activity that guide learned behavioral responses (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib85">Zhang et al., 2019</xref>). However, manipulation of the âaversiveâ protocerebral posterior lateral 1 (PPL1) dopaminergic neurons does not detectably alter Ca<sup>2+</sup> signals in KCs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Boto et al., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Hige et al., 2015a</xref>). Furthermore, Ca<sup>2+</sup> responses in KCs are uniformly potentiated across compartments with appetitive classical conditioning protocols and unaltered in KCs following aversive protocols (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib45">Louis et al., 2018</xref>). This raises the question of how local, compartmentalized synaptic plasticity in KCs drives coherent changes across the array of downstream MBONs to modulate action selection during memory retrieval. Learning/dopamine-induced plasticity has been demonstrated in the MBONs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Berry et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Hige et al., 2015a</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Hige et al., 2015b</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib54">Owald et al., 2015</xref>), with dopamine also acting directly on them (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib69">Takemura et al., 2017</xref>) (in addition to KCs). Feedforward inhibition among MBONs that drive opposing behavioral outcomes provides a mechanism explaining how bidirectional valence coding in MBONs could be generated, with or without bidirectional presynaptic plasticity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib55">Perisse et al., 2016</xref>). The compartmentalized, dopamine-dependent plasticity in KCs and the necessity for dopamine receptors and downstream signaling molecules in the intrinsic KCs points to a potential presynaptic contribution (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">Kim et al., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib49">McGuire et al., 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib83">Zars et al., 2000</xref>). Thus, compartmentalized presynaptic plasticity could contribute to reweighting the flow of olfactory information to downstream circuits.</p><p>Here, we describe how learning alters the flow of information through the MB via alteration of synaptic release of the KC neurotransmitter acetylcholine (ACh) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Barnstedt et al., 2016</xref>), using a genetically encoded indicator of ACh neurotransmission. The data reveal that appetitive and aversive learning alter compartmentalized acetylcholine release in distinct spatial patterns, with differing molecular mechanisms, coherently reweighting the flow of olfactory information across the ensemble of downstream neurons that mediate action selection.</p></sec><sec id="s2" sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><sec id="s2-1"><title>Associative learning modulates neurotransmitter release in a spatially distinct manner across longitudinal axonal compartments</title><p>Synapses within each MB compartment transmit olfactory information from KCs to compartment-specific MBONs (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1</xref>, Figure 5 A, Figure 5-figuresupplement 1A ; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Aso et al., 2014a</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib70">Tanaka et al., 2008</xref>). The MBONs exert distinct and often-opposing effects on behavior, with some innately promoting approach and others promoting avoidance (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Aso et al., 2014b</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Berry et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Ichinose et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib54">Owald et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib55">Perisse et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib58">PlaÃ§ais et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib61">Sayin et al., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib66">SÃ©journÃ© et al., 2011</xref>). Synaptic depression has been observed (postsynaptically) at KC-MBON synapses following pairing of odor with stimulation of PPL1 neurons that are critical for aversive learning (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Hige et al., 2015a</xref>), suggesting that depression could be the primary learning rule implemented at these synapses. While some MBONs exhibit bidirectional responses to conditioning, the major described mechanism involves a sign change that occurs postsynaptic to the KCs (polysynaptic feedforward inhibition) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib54">Owald et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib55">Perisse et al., 2016</xref>) and the presynaptic contributions remain unknown. To test for the presence, directionality, and variation of presynaptic plasticity across MB axonal compartments, we expressed a synaptic ACh sensor to monitor neurotransmitter release from KCs in vivo (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib85">Zhang et al., 2019</xref>). The genetically encoded ACh reporter, GPCR-ActivationâBased-ACh sensor (GRAB-ACh) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1A</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">Jing et al., 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">Jing et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib85">Zhang et al., 2019</xref>), was expressed in KCs using the broad KC driver 238Y-Gal4. Appetitive conditioning was carried out, monitoring ACh release from the Î³ lobe compartments evoked by the olfactory conditioned stimuli (CS+ and CS-) before and after pairing the CS+ with a sucrose unconditioned stimulus (US) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1âfigure supplement 1</xref>). Responses were compared to those in odor-only control cohorts to determine whether any learning-induced changes resulted from potentiation or depression.

This was collapsed to a single value, the within-treatment Î(post/pre), for comparison across conditions. The Î(post/pre) of the CS+ and CS- was compared to determine how each changed relative to the other, and then each was compared to its respective odor-only control to quantify whether it was potentiated or depressed, accounting for any non-associative olfactory adaptation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1G-K</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s2">Figure 1âfigure supplement 2</xref>).</p><fig-group><fig id="fig1" position="float"><label>Figure 1.</label><caption><title>Compartment-specific alterations of acetylcholine (ACh) release in the mushroom body (MB) following appetitive conditioning.</title><p>(<bold>A</bold>) Diagram of the GRAB-ACh reporter expressed in presynaptic terminals of a Kenyon cell (KC), viewed from a frontal plane. nAChR: nicotinic ACh receptor; dors: dorsal; lat: lateral, post: posterior; MBON: mushroom body output neuron.

Conditioning significantly increased CS+ responses relative to the CS- responses in the three most proximal Î³ lobe compartments: Î³1, Î³2, and Î³3 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1C, Dâ</xref>; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s2">Figure 1âfigure supplement 2</xref>). In each of these compartments, this was due to different underlying dynamics. In the Î³1 compartment, the CS+response was potentiated: following appetitive conditioning, the Î(post/pre) CS+ response was significantly larger than the respective odor-only control (ethyl butyrate: EB), while the CS- did not differ from its odor-only control (isoamyl acetate: IA) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1G</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s2">Figure 1âfigure supplement 2</xref>). In Î³1, the CS+ response significantly increased following conditioning (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1D</xref>). While the CS- response decreased following conditioning (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1D</xref>), this decrease was indistinguishable from the rate of adaptation among odor-only controls in that compartment (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1G</xref>). This suggests that the main effect in the Î³1 compartment was potentiation of the CS+ response, and highlights the value of normalizing for non-associative olfactory adaptation. In the Î³2 compartment, both the CS+ was potentiated and the CS- depressed relative to the odor-only controls (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1H</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s2">Figure 1âfigure supplement 2</xref>). In the Î³3 compartment, while the CS+ and CS- differed, neither was significantly altered relative to odor-only controls. However, there was a trend toward depression in the CS- group (<italic>P</italic> = 0.099) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1I</xref>), as well as a significant decrease in the post-conditioning CS- response (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s2">Figure 1âfigure supplement 2</xref>). Overall, these data reveal a spatial gradient of relative CS+ enhancement in the proximal Î³ compartments, shifting from CS+ potentiation in Î³1 toward CS- depression in Î³3, with the spatially intermediate Î³2 exhibiting both (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1L</xref>). This gradient of CS+:CS- plasticity suggests that both the CS+ and CS- contribute to learning by modulating compartmentalized KC (and downstream MBON) output, with different forms of plasticity in each compartment.</p><p>Moving further down the distal length of the KC axons, the plasticity produced by appetitive conditioning shifted from relative CS+ potentiation (âCS+:CS-) to depression. In the most distal Î³5 compartment, the CS+ response was reduced relative to the CS- following appetitive conditioning (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1E, F, K</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s2">Figure 1âfigure supplement 2</xref>). The effect could not be unambiguously assigned to CS+ depression, though there was no evidence of CS- potentiation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1K</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s2">Figure 1âfigure supplement 2</xref>). In addition, control flies for RNAi experiments (discussed further below) exhibited a trend toward a reduction in the CS+:CS- response in the Î³5 compartment following appetitive conditioning (Figure 3), accompanied by a significant decrease in CS+ response (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s1">Figure 3âfigure supplement 1D</xref>). These lines of evidence point to a depression in CS+ evoked ACh release from the distal Î³5 compartment. Overall, appetitive conditioning increased relative CS+responsivity in Î³1âÎ³3 compartments, which was derived from a proximal-to-distal gradient of CS+ potentiation to CS- depression, and reduction of relative CS+ responsivity in the Î³5 compartment (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1L</xref>). Thus, the plasticity was bidirectional between the proximal and distal axonal compartments. This likely contributes to approach behavior by simultaneously enhancing the conditioned odor-evoked activation of downstream âapproachâ circuits and inhibiting âavoidanceâ MBON circuits.</p></sec><sec id="s2-2"><title>Aversive conditioning drives ACh release in the opposite direction across MB compartments</title><p>The above data suggested that appetitive conditioning potentiated ACh synaptic release from the proximal Î³ lobe compartments. Yet synaptic depression is the main described plasticity mechanism at the KC-MBON synapses following olfactory conditioning (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Barnstedt et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib50">Modi et al., 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib54">Owald et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib55">Perisse et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib66">SÃ©journÃ© et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib84">Zhang and Roman, 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib85">Zhang et al., 2019</xref>). In the Î³1 compartment, where it has been examined in detail with electrophysiology, aversive reinforcement via dopaminergic neuron stimulation produces synaptic depression (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Hige et al., 2015a</xref>). Since many of the prior studies involved aversive reinforcement, we reasoned that appetitive and aversive conditioning may produce bidirectional plasticity of ACh release within each compartment, with the sign/directionality matching the postsynaptic MBON valence. To test this, we examined whether aversive conditioning produced the opposite effect in the same compartments as appetitive conditioning did. ACh release from KCs was imaged with GRAB-ACh and flies were trained with an aversive odor-shock conditioning protocol (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2A and B</xref>). In these experiments, we focused on the Î³2âÎ³5 compartments, as the fly was mounted at a higher angle, making the GRAB-ACh signal difficult to simultaneously visualize from Î³1 along with that of the other compartments. Following aversive conditioning, there was a reduction in the CS+ response relative to the CS- in the Î³2 and Î³3 compartments (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2C-H</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s1">Figure 2âfigure supplement 1</xref>). This was due to depression in the CS+ response, as the Î(post/pre) of the CS+ was significantly lower than the odor-only controls in each compartment (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2G and H</xref>). The Î³4 and Î³5 compartments exhibited no significant change in ACh release (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2I, J</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s1">Figure 2âfigure supplement 1</xref>).

Thus, appetitive and aversive conditioning produced bidirectional plasticity within multiple compartments, which likely represents a presynaptic contribution to learning-induced changes in odor responsivity among postsynaptic MBONs following conditioning (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Berry et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Hige et al., 2015a</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib54">Owald et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib85">Zhang et al., 2019</xref>).</p><fig-group><fig id="fig2" position="float"><label>Figure 2.</label><caption><title>Compartment-specific alterations of acetylcholine (ACh) release in the mushroom body (MB) following aversive conditioning.</title><p>(<bold>A</bold>) Diagram of the aversive conditioning apparatus.

This suggests that while presynaptic potentiation requires Cac across the MB compartments, depression may not. To directly test whether depression of the CS+ was affected, we turned to aversive conditioning, which generates robust CS+ depression in the proximal Î³ compartments (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2</xref>). Cac was knocked down using the same conditional RNAi strategy as above.

This represents a potential physiological mechanism underlying reward learning. To test whether reduction in Cac levels impaired reward learning, we carried out behavioral olfactory appetitive conditioning experiments. Cac was knocked down in KCs using the same conditional expression strategy as above, reducing Cac level ~29% (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s1">Figure 3âfigure supplement 1</xref>). Flies were trained with a conditioning paradigm in which a CS+ (EB or IA) was paired with sucrose, the other odor was presented as the CS-, and the flies were allowed to choose between the two odors in a T-maze. Conditional Cac knockdown impaired behavioral performance (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3H</xref>), reminiscent of its previously reported role in aversive conditioning (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Hidalgo et al., 2021</xref>). Odor avoidance was unaffected by Cac knockdown (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s1">Figure 3âfigure supplement 1A</xref>,B), demonstrating that the effect was not due to loss of olfactory acuity.

Therefore, we reasoned that inositol triphosphate receptor (IP<sub>3</sub>R) mediated Ca<sup>2+</sup> release may contribute to presynaptic plasticity across MB compartments. To test this, we conditionally knocked down the IP<sub>3</sub>R in the adult MB with RNAi. GRAB-ACh was expressed in the MB (as above), while conditionally knocking down IP<sub>3</sub>R (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s1">Figure 4âfigure supplement 1</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s2">Figure 4âfigure supplement 2</xref>). For these experiments, flies were aversively conditioned (IP<sub>3</sub>R knockdown impairs feeding under the microscope, precluding appetitive conditioning). Knockdown of IP<sub>3</sub>R eliminated the post-conditioning contrast between the CS+ and CS- (i.e. the difference between the CS+ and CS-) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4G-I</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s1">Figure 4âfigure supplement 1</xref>). However, this was not due to a loss of depression in the CS+ groups, rather it was due to the appearance of olfactory adaptation in the other groups. This was seen as a decrease in the post-treatment odor responses in the CS- and odor-only controls (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4G</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s1">Figure 4âfigure supplement 1C</xref>), with concomitant Î(post/pre) values &lt; 1 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4H</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s1">Figure 4âfigure supplement 1D</xref>). As there was no US presented in the odor-only control groups, this reduction in olfactory response represents adaptation, rather than a conditioned, associative change. Therefore, in normal conditions, release of Ca<sup>2+</sup> from the ER via IP<sub>3</sub>R is necessary to maintain odor responsivity upon repeated odor presentations. Loss of IP<sub>3</sub>R renders the KCs more susceptible to adaptation at this time point (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1âfigure supplement 1</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4H</xref>), reducing the contrast between the CS+ (which exhibits depression following aversive learning) and the other odor(s).</p></sec><sec id="s2-6"><title>IP<sub>3</sub>R maintains neurotransmitter release during repeated odor exposure</title><p>To directly test how adaptation to odors was impacted by the loss of IP<sub>3</sub>R, as suggested by analysis of pre/post odor responses in the conditioning experiments above, we carried out an olfactory adaptation assay. Flies were presented an odor 10 times over the course of 10 min while imaging the GRAB-ACh responses. To test for olfactory adaptation at each time point, the ÎF/F was compared to the initial naÃ¯ve odor presentation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4J</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s1">Figure 4âfigure supplement 1</xref>).

In contrast, knocking down IP<sub>3</sub>R in KCs produced significant olfactory adaptation in the Î³2 and Î³3 compartments (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4L</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s1">Figure 4âfigure supplement 1</xref>). In Î³2, following the fourth-odor presentation, there was a significant depression in odor-evoked ACh release at all-time points save one (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4L</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s1">Figure 4âfigure supplement 1</xref>). A similar effect was observed in the Î³3, where following the third-odor presentation, a significant depression in release occurred (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s2">Figure 4âfigure supplement 2</xref>). The Î³1 compartment showed no evidence of adaptation, suggesting that IP<sub>3</sub>R may support plasticity in this compartment via another mechanism (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s2">Figure 4âfigure supplement 2</xref>). The Î³4 and Î³5 compartments exhibited no significant adaptation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s2">Figure 4âfigure supplement 2</xref>). Overall, these data suggest that IP<sub>3</sub>R-dependent Ca<sup>2+</sup> release from the ER may contribute to maintenance of synaptic strength, preventing adaptation during repeated stimuli. Further, loss of IP<sub>3</sub>R leads to alterations in neurotransmitter release that particularly impact compartments dominated by CS+depression.</p><p>To confirm the site of ACh release, we blocked neurotransmitter release from KCs by expressing the temperature-sensitive dynamin mutant <italic>Shibire</italic><sup>ts</sup> with R13F02-Gal4 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib40">Kitamoto, 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib48">McGuire et al., 2001</xref>). Odor-evoked GRAB-ACh transients were imaged across MB compartments, as above, before, and after shifting flies from the permissive (20Â°C) to the restrictive (30Â°C) temperature. Blocking synaptic transmission from KCs inhibited the GRAB-ACh responses across compartments (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s3">Figure 4âfigure supplement 3</xref>). There was some residual response at the restrictive temperature (particularly in Î³1), which we reasoned may emanate from KCs that were not labeled by the R13F02-Gal4 driver. To quantify the coverage of this driver, we counted GRAB-ACh labeled neurons (immunostained with an anti-GFP antibody), finding that R13F02-Gal4 labeled 745 Â± 47 neurons (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s3">Figure 4âfigure supplement 3</xref>) out of ~2000 total KCs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Aso et al., 2009</xref>). Inhibiting this relatively small subset of KCs significantly reduced the GRAB-ACh response from the MB compartments, demonstrating that KCs are the major ACh source, though cholinergic MBONs could also contribute to the signal (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib63">Scheffer et al., 2020</xref>).</p></sec><sec id="s2-7"><title>Compartmentalized plasticity propagates into downstream mushroom body output neurons</title><p>Since ACh release from each compartment provides input to unique postsynaptic MBONs, the presynaptic plasticity observed in each compartment should be mirrored in the respective postsynaptic MBON(s) innervating that compartment. To test this, we imaged Ca<sup>2+</sup> responses in MBONs with GCaMP and examined the effect of appetitive conditioning. Four sets of MBONs were tested, each innervating and receiving cholinergic input from a distinct MB Î³ lobe compartment: Î³1pedc&gt;Î±/Î², Î³2Î±â²1, Î³3/Î³3Î²â²1, and Î³5Î²â²2a (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5A</xref>). Within the Î³ lobe, these neurons innervate the Î³1, Î³2, Î³3, and Î³5 compartments, respectively (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5BâF</xref>). We focused our analysis on the Î³2Î±â²1 and Î³3/Î³3Î²â²1 MBONs, which have not been studied intensively in the context of appetitive conditioning. The Î³2Î±â²1 MBON exhibited an increase in the relative CS+ responses following conditioning (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5D</xref>). The plasticity could not be unambiguously attributed to purely CS+ potentiation or CS- depression. The Î³3/Î³3Î²â²1 MBONs exhibited an increase in the relative CS+ responses (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5F</xref>). In this case, it was due to potentiation of the CS+ response (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5F</xref>). Note that this pair of MBONs is not parsed with available drivers and they were imaged together. One of them (Î³3Î²â²1) receives major input from the Î²â²1 lobe/compartment in addition to Î³3. Presynaptically, the Î³3 compartment exhibited a depression in the CS- response, suggesting that the potentiation in the Î³3/Î³3Î²â²1 CS+ response may emanate from potentiated Î²â²1 inputs. The Î³1pedc&gt;Î±/Î² and Î³5Î²â²2 a MBONs have been reported to exhibit bidirectional plasticity following aversive and appetitive conditioning (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib54">Owald et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib55">Perisse et al., 2016</xref>); we examined the plasticity in these MBONs (and others) using the same odors/conditions that were used to probe presynaptic plasticity in KCs. Following appetitive conditioning, the Î³1pedc&gt;Î±/Î² MBON exhibited a significant elevation of the CS+ response relative to the CS- (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5s1">Figure 5âfigure supplement 1</xref>). This was due to a potentiation of the CS+ response, as the post-conditioning CS+ response was significantly larger than the corresponding odor-only control. Finally, appetitive conditioning produced plasticity in the opposite direction in the Î³5Î²â²2 a MBON; this neuron exhibited a decrease in the CS+ response relative to the CS- (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5s1">Figure 5âfigure supplement 1</xref>). Overall, the directionality of the plasticity in MBONs matched that observed in ACh responses in the presynaptic compartment.

In particular, the involvement of these MBONs in appetitive memory is unclear.

Blocking the Î³2Î±â²1 MBON did not significantly impair performance in appetitive conditioning (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5B</xref>). Therefore, while activation of the Î³2Î±â²1 MBON drives approach behavior (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Aso et al., 2014b</xref>) and the neuron is necessary for aversive memory (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Berry et al., 2018</xref>), it is not crucial for appetitive short-term memory in the otherwise intact nervous system. In contrast, blocking synaptic transmission from the Î³3/Î³3Î²â²1 MBONs significantly impaired appetitive conditioning performance (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5B</xref>). This demonstrates that the output of the Î³3/Î³3Î²â²1 MBONs is not only sufficient for protein synthesis-dependent appetitive long-term memory (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib77">Wu et al., 2017</xref>) but also serves a key role for normal appetitive short-term memory. These neurons convey the output of the MB Î³3 compartment to the crepine and superior medial protocerebrum (where they innervate interneurons that project to the fan-shaped body and lateral accessory lobe further downstream), as well as provide direct contralateral MB feedback and form polysynaptic feedback loops via MB-innervating PAM dopaminergic neurons and other MBONs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib62">Scaplen et al., 2021</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib78">Xu et al., 2020</xref>). The Î³3 PAM dopaminergic neuron is also bidirectionally modulated through sucrose-activated allatostatin A neurons (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib80">Yamagata et al., 2016</xref>). These multi-layered connections provide several routes through which they could modulate behavioral output following learning. Overall, the present data suggest that the Î³3/Î³3Î²â²1 MBONs receive input from an MB compartment with unique physiology and represent a key node through which discriminative effects influence sucrose-activated appetitive memory and decision-making.</p></sec></sec><sec id="s3" sec-type="discussion"><title>Discussion</title><p>Compartmentalized plasticity in neurotransmitter release expands the potential computational capacity of learning circuits. It allows a set of odor-coding MB neurons to bifurcate their output to different downstream approach- and avoidance-driving downstream output neurons, independently modulating the synaptic connections to alter action selection based on the conditioned value of olfactory stimuli. The KCs modify the encoded value of olfactory stimuli through bidirectional plasticity in odor responses, which vary in a compartment-specific manner along the length of the axons. These changes were observed following pairing an olfactory CS with gustatory/somatosensory US (sucrose feeding or electric shock) in vivo. The CS+ and CS- drive unique patterns of plasticity in each compartment, demonstrating that olfactory stimuli are reweighted differently across compartments following learning, depending on the temporal associations of the stimuli. Different molecular mechanisms govern the potentiation of trained odor responses (Ca<sub>V</sub>2/Cac) and maintenance of responsivity over time (IP<sub>3</sub>R). Finally, one set of Î³ output neurons, Î³3/Î³3Î²â²1, is important for appetitive short-term memory.</p><p>Learning-induced plasticity of ACh release in the MB was bidirectional within the compartment, depending on the valence of the US, and was coherent with the valence of the MBON downstream of the compartment. Notably, the Î³2 and Î³3 MB compartments, which relay information to approach-promoting MBONs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Aso et al., 2014b</xref>), exhibited plasticity that was coherent with promoting behavioral approach following appetitive conditioning and avoidance after aversive conditioning. There was an increase in the relative CS+:CS- ACh responses after appetitive conditioning, and conversely reduced CS+:CS- ACh responses following aversive conditioning. For this study, we focused on the time point 5 min following conditioning, which is consistent with behavioral short-term memory. Aversive conditioning was previously reported to decrease neurotransmitter release from KCs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib84">Zhang and Roman, 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib85">Zhang et al., 2019</xref>). Indirect evidence, via Ca<sup>2+</sup> imaging in presynaptic KCs, suggested that increases in presynaptic neurotransmission could also be associated with learning. Pairing odor with stimulation of appetitive PAM dopaminergic neurons potentiates odor-evoked cytosolic Ca<sup>2+</sup> transients across the KC compartments (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Boto et al., 2014</xref>). Appetitive conditioning increases odor-evoked Ca<sup>2+</sup> transients across KC compartments (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib45">Louis et al., 2018</xref>). Stimulation of dopaminergic circuits associated with reward learning potentiate MB Î³4 connections with the respective Î³4 MBON (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Handler et al., 2019</xref>). We did not detect a statistically significant effect in Î³4 with appetitive or aversive classical conditioning, though the CS+ and CS- trended in the same direction as the adjacent Î³5 compartment following conditioning. Overall, the present data demonstrate that there are bidirectional changes in neurotransmitter (ACh) release from MB compartments following appetitive vs aversive learning and provide a window into the spatial patterns of plasticity across compartments following associative learning.</p><p>Behavioral alterations following conditioning involve changes in responses among the MBONs. As the KCs provide presynaptic olfactory input to the MBONs, it was a logical a priori assumption that presynaptic plasticity in the KCs could be altered in a compartmental manner and contribute to the changes in MBON responses after conditioning. Yet data from previous Ca<sup>2+</sup> imaging experiments have not completely supported this model. Compartmentalized effects have been observed in KCs with non-associative learning protocols (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Cohn et al., 2015</xref>) and within the Î³4 compartment following associative learning (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Handler et al., 2019</xref>). In contrast, classical conditioning produces no compartmentalized differences in odor-evoked Ca<sup>2+</sup> responses. Appetitive conditioning with odor + sucrose pairing increases odor-evoked cytosolic Ca<sup>2+</sup> transients in KCs across the Î³ lobe compartments (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib45">Louis et al., 2018</xref>). Aversive conditioning produces no net change across the compartments (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib45">Louis et al., 2018</xref>), but alters synapse-specific Ca<sup>2+</sup> responses at the individual bouton level (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Bilz et al., 2020</xref>). If the compartmental effects of conditioning (observed with Ca<sup>2+</sup> imaging) in KCs drove a proportional change in neurotransmitter release, both the approach- and avoidance-promoting MBONs would be simultaneously potentiated. Extracellular influx of Ca<sup>2+</sup> through voltage-gated calcium channels is a primary driver of neurotransmitter release; however, there are multiple sources of Ca<sup>2+</sup> in the cytosol that could contribute to the GCaMP signals (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Grienberger and Konnerth, 2012</xref>). A major conclusion of the present study is that learning drives compartmentalized plasticity in neurotransmitter release that is coherent with the behavioral valence of the corresponding MBON.</p><p>At least two major molecular mechanisms govern the spatial patterns of plasticity across the MB compartments: a Cac-dependent CS+ potentiation and an IP<sub>3</sub>R-dependent maintenance of sensory responses over trials/time. This suggests that different sources of Ca<sup>2+</sup> play different roles in regulating KC synaptic responses. Cac is the pore-forming subunit of the voltage-sensitive, presynaptic Ca<sub>V</sub>2 Ca<sup>2+</sup> channel in <italic>Drosophila</italic>. Ca<sub>V</sub>2 channels regulate several forms of synaptic plasticity, including paired-pulse facilitation, homeostatic plasticity, and long-term potentiation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Frank et al., 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Inchauspe et al., 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib52">Nanou et al., 2016</xref>). Our data suggest that these channels regulate the spatial patterns of learning-induced plasticity in the MB unidirectionally (from baseline), with Cac underlying potentiation but not depression. Ca<sub>V</sub>2 channel activity is modulated by presynaptic calcium and G protein-coupled receptor activity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib82">Zamponi and Currie, 2013</xref>), and channel localization in the active zone dynamically regulates synaptic strength (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Gratz et al., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib46">LÃ¼bbert et al., 2019</xref>). Thus, Cac insertion into, or increased clustering within, the active zones may underlie learning-induced potentiation (e.g. in the Î³1-Î³2 compartments following appetitive conditioning). Conditional knockdown of Cac, which reduced Cac levels by ~29%, impaired this potentiation, likely by decreasing the number of available channels for modulation. Baseline stimulus-evoked neurotransmitter release was maintained during Cac knockdown, mediated either by the significant residual Cac expression or compensation by other intracellular Ca<sup>2+</sup> channels/sources. In contrast to the Cac effect on potentiation, IP<sub>3</sub>R was necessary to maintain normal odor responsivity when odors were presented repeatedly across multiple trials (whether those were pre/post trials in the conditioning protocol or 10Ã odor presentations in the adaptation protocol). This is broadly consistent with the temporal role of IP<sub>3</sub>R in maintenance of presynaptic homeostatic potentiation at the neuromuscular junction (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">James et al., 2019</xref>). In addition, dopaminergic circuits associated with reward learning drive release of Ca<sup>2+</sup> from the endoplasmic reticulum when activated with KCs in a backward pairing paradigm ex vivo, potentiating MB Î³4 connections with the respective Î³4 MBON (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Handler et al., 2019</xref>). This is consistent with a role for ER calcium in positively regulating synaptic strength.</p><p>We observed potentiation and depression of ACh release across multiple MB compartments following conditioning, providing a presynaptic mechanism that potentially contributes to shaping conditioned MBON responses. Importantly, by comparing the CS+ and CS- responses to those of untrained odors, we ascribed plasticity to potentiation or depression (accounting for any non-associative olfactory adaptation) within each compartment. This is relevant for modeling efforts, where it has been unclear whether to include potentiation (along with depression) in the learning rule(s) at KC-MBON synapses (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Abdelrahman et al., 2021</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Bennett et al., 2021</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">Jiang and Litwin-Kumar, 2021</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib68">Springer and Nawrot, 2021</xref>). In addition, the experiments revealed an additional layer of spatial regulation in the Î³1âÎ³3 compartments: a gradient of CS+ potentiation to CS- depression following appetitive conditioning. Specifically, the CS+/CS- relationship changed in a linear gradient down the Î³1âÎ³3 compartments following appetitive conditioning. Appetitive conditioning increased CS+ responses in the Î³1 compartment, while decreasing the CS- responses in the Î³3 compartment. The Î³2 compartment yielded a mix of these responses. These patterns of plasticity have the net effect of increasing the relative response to the CS+ odor (âCS+:CS-). Since the MBONs postsynaptic to these compartments drive behavioral approach (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Aso et al., 2014b</xref>), this would bias the animal to approach the CS+ if it encountered both odors simultaneously. Such a situation occurs at the choice point of a T-maze during retrieval in a classical conditioning assay. The CS+ and CS- produce different patterns of plasticity at different loci (e.g. Î³1 vs Î³3), which presumably coordinate to regulate behavior via temporal integration of the odor and US cues (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Berry et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Handler et al., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">Jacob and Waddell, 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib41">KÃ¶nig et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib71">Tanimoto et al., 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib74">Tully and Quinn, 1985</xref>). The CS+ is temporally contiguous with the US, while the CS- is nonoverlapping. Therefore, the timing of CS/US pairing drives plasticity differently in each compartment. These patterns of plasticity presumably coordinate to regulate memory formation and action selection during retrieval. For instance, while the Î³1âÎ³3 compartments exhibited âCS+:CS- following appetitive conditioning, the Î³5 compartment exhibited plasticity in the opposite direction: decreasing the relative response to the CS+ odor (âCS+:CS-). As the Î³5 compartment is presynaptic to an avoidance-promoting MBON, this plasticity pattern would coherently contribute to biasing the animal toward CS+ approach (reducing CS+ avoidance). Thus, it would work in concert with the plasticity in Î³1âÎ³3 to bias the animal toward behavioral approach. Overall, plasticity is regulated in each MB compartment individually by the timing of events and the valence of the US, with the changes coordinated across multiple compartments to coherently drive behavior.</p><p>Behaviorally, MBONs innervating the Î³ lobe variably drive behavioral approach or avoidance when stimulated (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Aso et al., 2014b</xref>). Despite the approach-promoting valence of the Î³2Î±â²one and Î³3/Î³3Î²â²1 MBONs, among them, only the Î³3/Î³3Î²â²1 MBONs produced a loss-of-function phenotype in behavioral appetitive conditioning. This suggests that redundancy and/or different weighting across approach promoting MBONs renders the system resilient to silencing some of them. A previous study found effects of blocking the Î³2Î±â²1 MBONs, though not Î³3/Î³3Î²â²1 MBONs, when blocking individual steps of memory processing (acquisition, retention, and/or retrieval) with a 1 hr appetitive memory protocol (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Ichinose et al., 2021</xref>). This suggests that the different MBONs have differing roles across time, with some redundancy in appetitive processing. Blocking synaptic output of Î³3/Î³3Î²â²1 MBONs reduced appetitive conditioning performance in our experiments immediately following conditioning, suggesting that these neurons play a specific role in appetitive short-term memory.</p><p>The present and previous studies suggest that alterations of MBON activity following learning are the product of both presynaptic and postsynaptic plasticity at the KC-MBON synapses, as well as feedforward inhibition (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Hige et al., 2015a</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib55">Perisse et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib59">Pribbenow et al., 2021</xref>). Blocking synaptic output from KCs impairs the acquisition of appetitive memories (30â60 min after conditioning), suggesting a role for postsynaptic plasticity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib59">Pribbenow et al., 2021</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib65">Schwaerzel et al., 2003</xref>). However, this does not rule out presynaptic plasticity, as blocking KC output (with R13F02) leaves signaling from reinforcing dopaminergic neurons partially intact (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Cervantes-Sandoval et al., 2017</xref>), which likely shapes the presynaptic KC responses via heterosynaptic plasticity. At the circuit level, polysynaptic inhibition can convert depression from select MB compartments into potentiation in MBONs following learning; in one established example, reduction of odor-evoked responses in the GABAergic Î³1pedc MBON following aversive conditioning disinhibits the downstream Î³5Î²â²2 a MBON (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib54">Owald et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib55">Perisse et al., 2016</xref>).</p><p>KC-MBON synapses represent one node of learning-related plasticity, which is distributed across multiple sites during learning. Short-term memory-related plasticity has been observed in multiple olfactory neurons, such as the antennal lobes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib81">Yu et al., 2004</xref>) and KCs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib45">Louis et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib75">Wang et al., 2008</xref>). In addition, connectomics studies have revealed complex connectivity within and beyond the MB, which is a multi-layered network including circuit motifs that influence the propagation of information and generation of plasticity during learning. Such connections include recurrent feedback (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Aso et al., 2014a</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Ichinose et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib42">Li et al., 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib53">Otto et al., 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib62">Scaplen et al., 2021</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib69">Takemura et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib86">Zhao et al., 2018</xref>). Some of these recurrent connections are from cholinergic MBONs that synapse within the MB, which could have contributed to the ACh signals we observed in this study. For instance, the Î³2Î±â²1 MBON is a cholinergic MBON that sends ~6% of its output back to the Î³ lobe (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib63">Scheffer et al., 2020</xref>). Some of the recurrent connections are formed by dopaminergic neurons, such as the PAM Î³4&lt;Î³1/y2 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Aso et al., 2014a</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib42">Li et al., 2020</xref>). In addition, reciprocal connections between KCs and dopaminergic neurons in the vertical lobes are necessary for memory retrieval (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Cervantes-Sandoval et al., 2017</xref>). This adds another layer of recurrent circuitry that may participate in reinforcement during associative learning (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Aso et al., 2014b</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Ichinose et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Ichinose et al., 2021</xref>). Across these circuits, some neurons corelease several neurotransmitters and act on an array of postsynaptic receptors, which contribute to plasticity distributed across multiple sites (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Aso et al., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Barnstedt et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Berry et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Bielopolski et al., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Cohn et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Handler et al., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Haynes et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">Keene et al., 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">Kim et al., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib43">Liu and Davis, 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib59">Pribbenow et al., 2021</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib64">Schroll et al., 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib66">SÃ©journÃ© et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib67">Silva et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib76">Wu et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib87">Zhou et al., 2019</xref>).</p><p>Overall, plasticity between KCs and MBONs may guide behavior through biasing network activation to alter action selection in a probabilistic manner. Appetitive conditioning drives compartmentalized, presynaptic plasticity in KCs that correlates with postsynaptic changes in MBONs that guide learned behaviors. Prior studies documented only depression at these synapses at short time points following conditioning (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Hige et al., 2015a</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib84">Zhang and Roman, 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib85">Zhang et al., 2019</xref>). Here, we observed both potentiation and depression in ACh release in the MB, suggesting that bidirectional presynaptic plasticity modulates learned behaviors. These bidirectional changes likely integrate with plasticity at downstream circuit nodes that also undergo learning-induced plasticity to produce network-level alterations in odor responses across the olfactory pathway following salient events. Thus, plasticity in ACh release from KCs functions to modulate responsivity to olfactory stimuli features across graded plasticity maps down the MB axons.</p></sec><sec id="s4" sec-type="materials|methods"><title>Materials and methods</title><sec id="s4-1"><title>Fly strains</title><p>Flies were fed and maintained on a standard cornmeal agar food mixture on a 12:12 light:dark cycle.

Although we believe that these issues can be addressed experimentally and through text changes, we do not think that this substantial amount of work can be carried out within 2 months, the time <italic>eLife</italic> allows for revisions. As you will see, the reviewers were generally supportive of publication, but identified several key points such as (1) lack of behavioral experiments for the Cac knock-down experiments, (2) specific controls for some of the imaging experiments, (3) consideration of the role of dopaminergic neurons and (4) a lack of acknowledgment of the complexity of the mushroom body circuit and the literature that has addressed this previously. If the authors decide to address these issues, we are willing to consider a future manuscript, but it would be considered as a new submission.</p><p><italic>Reviewer #1:</italic></p><p>The paper aims to understand if and how axonal compartmentalization functions in the MB Î³ lobe in the context of olfactory learning. Further the authors focus on these process and find distinct molecular mechanisms underlying appetitive and aversive learning (cac and IP3). Lastly the authors focus on how this compartmentalization influences the downstream MBON function.</p><p>The paper is written well and straightforward in its approach and implications. The neuroanatomy, experimental details are clearly presented and I would rate this paper very high on a readability scale. The imaging and behavioral approaches are appropriate for the research question and address the limitations from a technical perspective. Results are presented well, but authors don't dwell on the results much before transitioning into another part of the question they seek to ask. This undermines the complexity of the MB circuits and an effort should be made to address dynamics of other lobes that underlie these behaviors. One issue is that even though the experiments work well together in supporting the results they fail to incorporate more complex dynamics of other lobes or consider the EM connectivity which might complicate the simplistic interpretations. The role of dopamine in this compartmental logic has not been directly addressed which potentially plays into this circuit.</p><p>This is impactful work as it addresses the pre-synaptic dynamics of MB with a focus on ACh release across compartments and how they differ between two forms of learning. The use of Grab Ach is a big highlight of the paper as this question could not have been asked without this tool. The authors also address the regulation of Ca<sup>2+</sup> responses in the compartments that result in altered responses in valence-coding MBONs. Its also interesting to see the switch in Î³2 and Î³3 dynamics between appetitive and aversive learning. Lastly the match of Ca<sup>2+</sup> responses in MBONs with the Ach compartmentalization highlights the behavioral relevance of axonal compartmentalization.</p><p>I like this paper as the experiments, results are clear and authors are very careful about interpreting the results. On a few occasions I feel that interpretations are over simplified and a focus on elaborating the complexities will be more helpful for the field.</p><p>Below are a few suggestions:</p><p>1) The use of Gal4 lines seems to be inconsistent between figures. The rationale for choosing a specific targeting tool should be made explicit.</p><p>2) The olfactory learning literature has many odor pairs and the one used here (ethyl butyrate and IAA) is not the most common pair. Do learning scores, neuroanatomy involved differ based on chosen odor pairs. Are learning rules generalizable across odor pairs.</p><p>3) Figure 1: Having some images from the rig set up would help in seeing how authors chose ROI's for the different compartments. The schematics are great but dont give a good sense for the real imaging resolution.</p><p>4) Figure 3: A schematic here like figure 1K would be great to align the reader. Also the n's here are half of figure 1. Is there a specific reason for that? How was power determined for these experiments.</p><p>5) Figure 4: It is not clear why Î³2 is the only compartment shown here.</p><p>6) The compartmentalized pre-synaptic plasticity mapping/mirroring the MBON Ca++ response is a great result but without knocking down Ach receptor in these MBONs I am not sure a direct link between Ach release and MBON Ca<sup>2+</sup> response cannot be made.</p><p>7) The above concern is somewhat addressed for Î³3 as they mediate timing and MBON from Î³3 are required for appetitive learning but is not addressed for other compartments and MBONs.</p><p>8) While, PAM and PPL1 neurons have been briefly discussed their role in modulating KC and MBON plasticity is not addressed experimentally which goes against what is know about this circuit. A more elaborate discussion would be beneficial. How do dopaminergic circuits associated with Î³4 interact with this circuit?</p><p>Overall I find that Ach compartmentalization is well justified but the downstream circuit connectivity and plasticity seems unclear. Without addressing the role of Ach receptors it is difficult to see the causal relationship between KC Ach release and MBON activity.</p><p><italic>Reviewer #2:</italic></p><p>Stahl et al. investigate presynaptic Kenyon cell plasticity in the context of appetitive and aversive memories, using a genetically-encoded acetylcholine receptor-based sensor as primary read-out (instead of calcium indicators used in several previous studies). Therefore, the authors investigate one step downstream of the classically conducted calcium (or cAMP, etc.) imaging experiments â the level of neurotransmitter release. Likewise, this is one step upstream of the other widely-used readout of the postsynaptic MBON activity (or dopaminergic neurons). The authors investigate contributions of CS+ and/or CS- plasticity throughout the compartments of the Î³ lobe. All in all, this manuscript confirms several previous studies that investigated individual compartment plasticity (often plasticity is measured at the level of the MBONs and therefore in single compartments), and taken together with other recent publications, this study can be seen as a valuable compendium (as it addresses appetitive and aversive short-term memory protocols in the context of several compartments). As the authors address an important step between presynaptic and postsynaptic calcium transients, their work actually confirms that conclusions deduced from changed calcium transients correlate to neurotransmitter release, as expected. This study also addresses differential effects on the CS+ and the CS-, which is important, as previous studies often concentrated (partially for technical reasons) on either the CS+ specifically, or the relative changes of CS+ to CS- only. The authors further investigate the role of the active zone-localized voltage gated calcium channel cacophony in memory-related plasticity â this part needs to be strengthened by additional controls.</p><p>1. As it stands, I am not sure what to read from the Cac knock-down experiments for several reasons. First, it is entirely unclear how efficient the knock-down works. Would the amount of Cac molecules be reduced from e.g., 20 to 15 per active zone, or less, or more (the authors should quantify cacophony following knock-down)? Second, if baseline transmission is not affected (which is remarkable to a certain degree â the authors do mention potential 'residual' Cac expression in the discussion), what about e.g., high frequency odor puff protocols (again the authors mention plasticity protocols in the discussion that may help tying the observed effects to Cac). Can the authors perform additional manipulations that should phenocopy the reduction of Cac (e.g., reduction of Brp via RNAi)? Can the phenotype be modulated by titrating extracellular calcium concentrations? Would basal neurotransmission be affected when extending the time at 32{degree sign}C (the range of 4-10 days could also be quite large, depending on the turnover time for cacophony). Third, can the authors exclude that the observed effects were due to dendritic functions of Cac?</p><p>The authors need to perform additional experiments in order to manifest this important claim.</p><p>2. What is the behavioral consequence of Cac or IP3R knock-down in Kenyon cells? Is memory impaired?</p><p>3. The authors actually do not demonstrate that the acetylcholine measured is released from MB neurons (Kenyon cells) and do not exclude the possibility that the measured acetylcholine could derive from an unknown other source. The authors could address this issue by Kenyon cell-specific knock-down of VAChT or ChaT. Alternatively, acute or chronic block of KCs, while measuring sensor activation, could be an option. I am puzzled by the wording in line 80: is 'putative' meant as 'generally accepted' or 'likely'? I would strongly recommend using a less ambiguous word in this context. If not generally accepted (if so, please do explain to the reader why), this would somewhat compromise the basis of this study.</p><p>4. Figure 1 and others: Why are only the means compared statistically? The pre to post in C and E should be analysed using paired statistics â as in Figure 3E/F or S4 for example. In Figure 1: are any changes detected within flies? Figure S1 suggest that this is not the case â the change would only become apparent between conditions? Although the authors have already done a good job in illustrating their protocols, data display should be more uniform potential discrepancies should be spelt out, and claims should be adjusted accordingly (e.g., summary in K).</p><p>5. Line 189: why a trend towards decrease? Figure S4 suggests a statistically significant change.</p><p>6. Absolute conditioning protocols: Is the comparison of the 'no CS-' and 'no CS+' really suited to claim that 'no CS-' leads to decreased acetylcholine release? It appears that this would only be consistent if the 'no CS-' group was significantly different from the 'no US' group. Please clarify putative discrepancies. In this context, please also discuss the results in S5 in more detail.</p><p>7. Figure S4 shows</p><p>a. gamma1: CS+ potentiation (not seen in Figure S1?), not apparent in Cac RNAi</p><p>b. gamma2: no potentiation for the CS+ (unlike what is reported in Figure 1), yet, consistently a depression for the CS-</p><p>c. gamma3: no potentiation of CS+, yet a depression of CS-, both inconsistent with Figure 1</p><p>d. Several forms of plasticity, also to the non-trained odor in controls and Cac RNAi</p><p>Please clarify and discuss the individual findings.</p><p>8. Line 467: It is first stated that odor was presented continuously for 30s. In the next sentence the authors write that six 1-s odor pulses with a 5s inter-pulse interval were given. Please clarify. Also, the odor responses appear to typically last for about 5-6s. Obviously, this is in parts based on the kinetics of the reporter. However, would the authors not expect that continuous odor application will lead to desensitization at the level of the olfactory receptor neurons?</p><p>9. Apart from showing that postsynaptic calcium signals are altered in MBONs the authors should consider showing whether the observed effects seen with the acetylcholine indicator can also be seen when expressed in MBONs or DANs (and exclude the possibility that the potentiation/depression could be specific to KC-DAN or KC-KC synapses).</p><p><italic>Reviewer #3:</italic></p><p>This study shows learning-induced compartmentalized plasticity in Kenyon cells (KCs) of the mushroom body Î³ lobe using a genetically encoded acetylcholine sensor. The authors made several major discoveries that the plasticity is bidirectional and depends on memory valence. Interestingly, the compartments along the axon terminals of the KCs undergo spatial 'gradient' of plasticity. Knock-down of the genes that differentially regulate intracellular calcium induced distinct effects on learning-induced plasticity. These results explain, at least partly, that learning-induced plasticity at KC-MBON synapses takes place on the presynaptic side. The experiments and analysis are overall thorough, and conclusions are generally supported by the results. In the following, I list some flaws to be addressed that concern necessary controls, more careful interpretation of the statistics and results, and the choice of the cac RNAi strain.</p><p>- Odor-only control is imperfect to formally distinguish if the plasticity arises from CS+ and/or CS- changes. The effect of sugar or shock presentation per se must be measured to make this distinction. Alternatively, the authors can examine how much of the 'plasticity' is explained by unpaired presentations of CS and US.</p><p>- Conditioning effects at some compartments are on the edge of statistical significance and look inconsistent among different experimental series (e.g. Figure 1F-J vs. Figure 3F). The authors need to be cautious to interpret these statistical results. For example, knock-down of cac impaired CS- depression in y2 and y3 as well (cf. Figure 1G, H, and K), and this is contradictory to their conclusion that cac is required only for potentiation. Similarly, itpr seem to globally affect presynaptic activities.</p><p>- Some of the major findings here have been consistent with previous papers with different measurements (e.g. Bilz et al. 2020 for Figure 2). On the other hand, this study presents results not coherent with existing studies. For example, previous papers of the authors found rather homogeneous calcium increase (Boto 2014, Louis 2018), while plasticity in this study is graded along the y lobe axons and opposite in appetitive and aversive conditioning (Figure 1, 2). MBON-y3 has been reported to be dispensable (Aso 2014 and Ichinose 2021) unlike the results in Figure 6E. The authors need to provide discussion that explain the coherence/apparent inconsistencies.</p><p>- The choice of this particular cac RNAi strain is not clear, besides no control experiment for off-target effects. This is technically important, since voltage-gated calcium channels must be required more than learning-dependent potentiation. Therefore, it is blunt to conclude:</p><p>&quot;synaptic exocytosis remained intact (L191)&quot; upon cac knock-down;</p><p>&quot;presynaptic potentiation, but not depression, requires the voltage-sensitive CaV2 Ca<sup>2+</sup> channel cacophony across the MB compartments (L198)&quot;;</p><p>&quot;Overall, these data demonstrate that Cac is not required for learning-induced depression of ACh release (L207)&quot;.</p><p>These conclusions need to be moderated.</p><p>Also in this context, mentioning a recent paper by Hidalgo et al. (Neurobiology of Disease, 2021) that analyzed the effect of cac-KD in KCs on aversive learning would be complementary to the physiological finding of this study.</p><p>- Compartmentalized and bidirectional plasticity in the MBONs has been repeatedly reported (e.g. Cohn, 2015; Owald, 2015). What is the intention to revisit this (Figure 5)? Also, this is essentially a detour from their main argument about the presynaptic mechanism. Consider revising the Figure or moving it to the figure supplement for readability. Similarly, it's not clear to me what Figure 6 adds to the overall conclusion.</p><p>- (Figure 6E) Did the authors examine MBON blocking in discriminative training? This needs to be clearly described. If the authors claim that the y3 compartment is important in discriminative training, they would need to show no defects in single-odor conditioning as in Figure 6A.</p><p>- Selection of ROIs for different MBONs in Figure 5 need stronger rationale. Why do the authors choose neurites for some compartments and not for others? I guess there is transformation of calcium signals in different parts of MBONs.</p><p>- Describe how the authors defined compartments in the g-KCs?</p><p>- I'm not totally sure how the results in Figure 6 support &quot;temporal comparison (L275)&quot;. Either elaborate this conclusion more or provide an alternative interpretation.</p><p>- The quantified compartment for Figure 4A-D should be clearly stated in the text and legend, instead of simply showing y2 in 4E and let us guess.</p><p>- Is &quot;post-conditioning odor contrast&quot; appropriate for explaining itpr effects given the CS+ depression is seemingly exaggerated (Figure 4)?</p><p>- L256 Sentence and/or figure citation are somewhat inconsistent.</p><p>[Editorsâ note: further revisions were suggested prior to acceptance, as described below.]</p><p>Thank you for resubmitting your work entitled &quot;Associative learning drives longitudinally-graded presynaptic plasticity of neurotransmitter release along axonal compartments&quot; for further consideration by <italic>eLife</italic>. Your revised article has been evaluated by Gary Westbrook (Senior Editor) and a Reviewing Editor. The manuscript has been improved but there are some remaining issues that need to be addressed, as outlined below:</p><p>The reviewers were overall happy with the revisions, but both raised a few points that need to be addressed before a final decision can be reached. Please pay attention in particular to the points 1. and 2. raised by reviewer 2. We believe these can be addressed by editing the text and toning down relevant statements.</p><p><italic>Reviewer #1:</italic></p><p>The authors have done a good job with this revised manuscript. They have addressed my previous concerns either by adding new experiments or clarifying passages in the text. Especially the role of Cac in appetitive learning and the more clear description of their analysis pipeline are convincing. Some experiments suggested, were technical not achievable with the presented techniques, and pursuing alternate methods would exceed the scope of this study.</p><p><italic>Reviewer #2:</italic></p><p>I've read the revised manuscript, and found it much improved. However, some of my concerns were not addressed. The authors need to clarify the following points before publication.</p><p>1. The odor-only control accounts for the effect of non-associative olfactory adaptation. But only that. The authors should be aware that other types of non-associative plasticity taking place during learning; e.g. reduced odor acuity by the previous exposure to electric shock (Preat, J Neurosci, 1998). Thus, inclusion of the US-only and/or unpaired training controls is mandatory to formally determine the absolute plasticity effect (e.g. potentiation of CS+ or depression CS- are indistinguishable; Figures 1L and 2K). Otherwise, they should moderate these claims, and focus only on the relative effects (i.e. &quot;CS+:CS-&quot; in the same figures)..</p><p>2. As demonstrated by the authors, Cac-KD reduces only ~29% of total Cac RNA level, suggesting that large body of Cac expression is unaffected. It is quite questionable that Cac is not required for learning-induced depression of Ach release (P10, L234) based on this partial down-regulation.</p><p>3. Somehow related to the previous point. Is it reasonable to conclude that Cac is required for learning-dependent potentiation? There is potentiation of CS- odor response in the Î³ 5 compartment after appetitive learning (Figure 3- sup1E)?</p></body></sub-article><sub-article article-type="reply" id="sa2"><front-stub><article-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.76712.sa2</article-id><title-group><article-title>Author response</article-title></title-group></front-stub><body><p>[Editorsâ note: the authors resubmitted a revised version of the paper for consideration.

As suggested, in the present version, we have further elaborated on the complexities of these circuits to provide the readers with a more comprehensive picture. This is woven throughout the manuscript, particularly the discussion (e.g., pages 22â23).</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Below are a few suggestions:</p><p>1) The use of Gal4 lines seems to be inconsistent between figures. The rationale for choosing a specific targeting tool should be made explicit.</p></disp-quote><p>It has now been made explicit in the manuscript text (in the Methods, page 24, and main text, pages 5,9). We used two Gal4 lines that express in KCs (including Î³ KCs): R13F02 and 238Y. Initial ACh imaging experiments were carried out using 238Y to drive GRABâACh expression; this provides maximal KC coverage, labeling 1898/~2000 KCs (Aso et al., 2009, J Neurogenet 23:156â72). However, 238Y also labels a relatively large number of other cell types outside the MB (ibid). We often observe lethality when driving various RNAi lines with this driver, likely due to the nonâKC expression in the driver. In addition, the driver produces developmental defects when expressing various RNAi lines throughout development, reinforcing the wellâknown potential for such issues when expression is not restricted to adulthood. Therefore, to mitigate these risks the molecular experiments, we switched to a more KCâselective driver, R13F02âGal4, and restricted the expression of the RNAi (and GRABâACh) to adulthood via Gal80<sup>ts</sup>. The number of KCs labeled by R13F02âGal4 had not been documented (to our knowledge). As this is a relevant parameter for the comparison of results across drivers, we labeled and counted them, finding that the driver labels 745 Â± 47 KCs; this is now included in the manuscript. Overall, the use of these two drivers/strategies provides complementary data sets, with 238Y providing insight into the plasticity across KCs and compartments, with the broadest possible KC coverage, and R13F02 providing more selective KC manipulations in the molecular experiments.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>2) The olfactory learning literature has many odor pairs and the one used here (ethyl butyrate and IAA) is not the most common pair. Do learning scores, neuroanatomy involved differ based on chosen odor pairs.

We have previously used EB and IA as an odor pair for behavior olfactory associative conditioning (Boto et al., 2019 Cell Rep 27: 2014â2021) and for olfactory stimuli in imaging experiments (Boto et al., 2014 24: 822â831; Louis et al., 2018 PNAS 115: E448âE457). Performance indexes in behavioral conditioning experiments are equivalent to another odor pair (Mch vs. Oct) (Boto et al., 2019), and we see no substantive difference in odorâevoked responses across KCs. Learning rules generalize across odors. Thus, by all available evidence, this odor pair is equally representative of odor space to any other.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>3) Figure 1: Having some images from the rig set up would help in seeing how authors chose ROI's for the different compartments.

Comparing Cac and IP3 RNAi, showing pre/post quantifications for CS+, CSâ, EB, and IA and box plots for one compartment introduces a relatively large number of conditions for the reader to track. Multiplying this five times over made for an unwieldy figure (we tried in earlier draft versions). For that level of detail, we direct the readers to Figure 4 â Supplement 1, which includes all compartments (stretching to 30 panels). Supplemental Figures appear sideâbyâside with a single click to toggle the view on the <italic>eLife</italic> web site upon publication, so the readers will be able to readily view all of the data. Nonetheless, to add spatial detail to the main Figure 4, we have now included a diagram of the plasticity effects across compartments (Figure 4, panels C,F,I).</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>6) The compartmentalized pre-synaptic plasticity mapping/mirroring the MBON Ca++ response is a great result but without knocking down Ach receptor in these MBONs I am not sure a direct link between Ach release and MBON Ca<sup>2+</sup> response cannot be made.</p></disp-quote><p>These experiments verify that plasticity drives responses in MBONs in the same direction as the KCs. Plasticity in MBONs likely reflects both preâ and postâsynaptic processes (e.g., Pribbenow et al., 2021, bioRxiv doi: 10.1101/2021.07.01.450776) (we now discuss this aspect further in the manuscript). Knockdown of the postsynaptic ACh receptors in this context would remove the input to MBONs but not isolate the effects of ACh release. The best way to do so is to monitor ACh release and manipulate presynaptic processes (e.g., presynaptic Cac Cav2 channels), which is the approach we selected. We have now further enhance the rigor of these experiments by blocking synaptic release from the KCs with <italic>Shibire</italic><sup>ts</sup> (Figure 4 â Supplement 3), which significantly inhibited the odorâevoked ACh signal.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>7) The above concern is somewhat addressed for Î³3 as they mediate timing and MBON from Î³3 are required for appetitive learning but is not addressed for other compartments and MBONs.</p></disp-quote><p>We focused on the Î³3 MBONs due to their novelty in terms of [presynaptic] CSâ effects and the relative paucity of studies examining their roles in behavioral conditioning.

The goal was to knock down Cac enough to test its role in plasticity, but not completely disrupt synaptic transmission. This is similar in approach to experiments previously carried out at the neuromuscular junction (Frank et al., 2006, Neuron 52:663â77; Muller et al., 2012, Curr Biol 22:1102â8). We chose an RNAi line that drives moderate knockdown (Brusich et al., 2015, Front. Cell. Neurosci 9:107) and expressed it conditionally under Gal80<sup>ts</sup> control. These details are now discussed more clearly in the manuscript. In addition, as requested, we quantified efficiency of the knockdown with quantitative PCR, expressing the RNAi panâneuronally and using the same Gal80ts/induction protocol. This revealed a ~29% reduction in Cac mRNA levels. Further details about the strategy and new experiment have been added to the manuscript in the main text and Methods.</p><p>Overall, the data demonstrate that Cac is necessary for the potentiation in proximal Î³ lobe compartments, identifying a key mechanism of learningâinduced presynaptic plasticity in the KCs. This is consistent with the role that Cac plays at the neuromuscular junction, where Cac levels are positively correlated with synaptic potentiation (Gratz et al., 2019; J Neurosci). Furthermore, presynaptic homeostatic potentiation at the neuromuscular junction is dependent on Cac and Ca<sup>2+</sup> levels (Frank et al., 2006, Neuron 52:663â77; Muller et al., 2012, Curr Biol 22:1102â8). Finally, Ca<sub>V</sub>2.1 levels at the active zone are dynamically regulated and positively drive synaptic strength in mammals as well (Lubbert et al., 2018, Neuron 101:260â273).</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Can the authors perform additional manipulations that should phenocopy the reduction of Cac (e.g., reduction of Brp via RNAi)?</p></disp-quote><p>We have not attempted Brp knockdown in this study, as it would likely impair synaptic transmission across multiple compartments in a nonâvalenceâspecific manner.

Overall, these experiments succeeded in allowing us to pinpoint Cac as a molecule that is important for regulating presynaptic plasticity and provided a molecular mechanism to manipulate/differentiate the plasticity occurring across the spatial compartments. The data demonstrated that Cac is necessary for the potentiation in proximal Î³ lobe compartments, identifying a key mechanism of learningâinduced presynaptic plasticity in the mushroom body. This is consistent with the role that Cac plays at the neuromuscular junction, where Cac levels are positively correlated with synaptic potentiation (Gratz et al., 2019; J Neurosci). Furthermore, presynaptic homeostatic potentiation at the neuromuscular junction is dependent on Cac and Ca<sup>2+</sup> levels (Frank et al., 2006, Neuron 52:663â77; Muller et al., 2012, Curr Biol 22:1102â8).

What is the behavioral consequence of Cac or IP3R knock-down in Kenyon cells? Is memory impaired?</p></disp-quote><p>To test this, we knocked down Cac and carried out appetitive conditioning, finding that shortâterm memory was indeed impaired (Figure 3H).</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>3. The authors actually do not demonstrate that the acetylcholine measured is released from MB neurons (Kenyon cells) and do not exclude the possibility that the measured acetylcholine could derive from an unknown other source. The authors could address this issue by Kenyon cell-specific knock-down of VAChT or ChaT. Alternatively, acute or chronic block of KCs, while measuring sensor activation, could be an option.</p></disp-quote><p>We have now addressed this with the latter experiment that the reviewer suggested â blocking KC output while monitoring ACh release with GRABâACh. The ACh signal was inhibited (Figure 4 â Supplement 3). Some signal was still observed, which likely emanates from the KCs that are not labeled by the driver and continue to respond to odors and release ACh (R13F02 labels ~746/2000 KCs). While the ACh signal imaged in the MB is clearly dominated by KCs, we do not exclude that there could be some contribution from nonâKCs, and added that caveat to the discussion.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>I am puzzled by the wording in line 80: is 'putative' meant as 'generally accepted' or 'likely'? I would strongly recommend using a less ambiguous word in this context. If not generally accepted (if so, please do explain to the reader why), this would somewhat compromise the basis of this study.</p></disp-quote><p>Agreed â ACh is the described neurotransmitter from KCs. We were trying to convey that, without ruling out that some hypothetical future study could report cotransmission of some other neurotransmitter(s) (as has occurred in some other cell types), but the language was inaccurate on its face. This has been clarified. The sentence now reads ââ¦synaptic release of the KC neurotransmitterâ¦â.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>4. Figure 1 and others: Why are only the means compared statistically? The pre to post in C and E should be analysed using paired statistics â as in Figure 3E/F or S4 for example. In Figure 1: are any changes detected within flies? Figure S1 suggest that this is not the case â the change would only become apparent between conditions? Although the authors have already done a good job in illustrating their protocols, data display should be more uniform potential discrepancies should be spelt out, and claims should be adjusted accordingly (e.g., summary in K).</p></disp-quote><p>We run all these comparisons on all data sets (Figure 1 â Supplement 1 and others). The key metric to detect potential/depression is the comparison of the Î(post/pre) between each experimental group and its respective odorâonly control group (e.g., CS+ vs. EB). This is because olfactory conditioning generates some alteration/adaptation of the olfactory responses simply as a function of exposing the animal to the odor. The post vs. pre comparison sometimes accurately reveals such differences, particularly if they are large (e.g., in Ca<sup>2+</sup> imaging experiments at the wholeâcell level, and, as the reviewer notes, in our subcellular data as well, in places). However, considering only the post vs. pre comparison would produce false negatives in some compartments that potentiate, as well as false positives in some compartments that do not. Therefore, we rely on the comparison of Î(post/pre) between each experimental group and its respective odorâonly control as the primary metric. As noted above, we also ran the post vs. pre comparisons and report significant differences where they were found (and trends where they are important and informative).</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>5. Line 189: why a trend towards decrease? Figure S4 suggests a statistically significant change.</p></disp-quote><p>Following the rationale above, we only counted a change as significant if it differed from the odor-only control in terms of Î(post/pre). The reviewer is correct â it is conservative here. This is often the case, as it requires that there be both a difference in Î(post/pre) and that the difference be larger than any Î(post/pre) in the odorâonly control.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>6. Absolute conditioning protocols: Is the comparison of the 'no CS-' and 'no CS+' really suited to claim that 'no CS-' leads to decreased acetylcholine release? It appears that this would only be consistent if the 'no CS-' group was significantly different from the 'no US' group. Please clarify putative discrepancies. In this context, please also discuss the results in S5 in more detail.</p></disp-quote><p>Upon consideration of the reviewersâ comments and the overall theme/flow of the manuscript, we have removed this experiment from the manuscript. We intend to follow up on this result more thoroughly in a future study.

In the next sentence the authors write that six 1-s odor pulses with a 5s inter-pulse interval were given. Please clarify. Also, the odor responses appear to typically last for about 5-6s. Obviously, this is in parts based on the kinetics of the reporter. However, would the authors not expect that continuous odor application will lead to desensitization at the level of the olfactory receptor neurons?</p></disp-quote><p>This was an error in the protocol description that has been corrected. For ACh imaging experiments, short odor pulses were used to avoid desensitization of the GRABâACh sensor. The reviewer is correct, the responses last longer than the odor pulse, likely due to the kinetics of the reporter. Continuous odor application was used only in behavioral experiments, where this is a standard approach (calibration of the odor concentrations in the Tâmaze to balance the naÃ¯ve distribution accounts for any imbalance in desensitization between odors).</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>9. Apart from showing that postsynaptic calcium signals are altered in MBONs the authors should consider showing whether the observed effects seen with the acetylcholine indicator can also be seen when expressed in MBONs or DANs (and exclude the possibility that the potentiation/depression could be specific to KC-DAN or KC-KC synapses).</p></disp-quote><p>Expression levels of the GRABâACh reporter are too low when expressed postsynaptically in the MBONs that we have tested so far.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Reviewer #3:</p><p>This study shows learning-induced compartmentalized plasticity in Kenyon cells (KCs) of the mushroom body Î³ lobe using a genetically encoded acetylcholine sensor. The authors made several major discoveries that the plasticity is bidirectional and depends on memory valence. Interestingly, the compartments along the axon terminals of the KCs undergo spatial 'gradient' of plasticity. Knock-down of the genes that differentially regulate intracellular calcium induced distinct effects on learning-induced plasticity. These results explain, at least partly, that learning-induced plasticity at KC-MBON synapses takes place on the presynaptic side. The experiments and analysis are overall thorough, and conclusions are generally supported by the results. In the following, I list some flaws to be addressed that concern necessary controls, more careful interpretation of the statistics and results, and the choice of the cac RNAi strain.</p><p>- Odor-only control is imperfect to formally distinguish if the plasticity arises from CS+ and/or CS- changes. The effect of sugar or shock presentation per se must be measured to make this distinction. Alternatively, the authors can examine how much of the 'plasticity' is explained by unpaired presentations of CS and US.</p></disp-quote><p>The odorâonly control accounts for the effect of nonâassociative olfactory adaptation. Comparison of the CS+ and CSâ in experimental groups reveal the associative changes in ACh release.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>- Conditioning effects at some compartments are on the edge of statistical significance and look inconsistent among different experimental series (e.g. Figure 1F-J vs. Figure 3F). The authors need to be cautious to interpret these statistical results. For example, knock-down of cac impaired CS- depression in y2 and y3 as well (cf. Figure 1G, H, and K), and this is contradictory to their conclusion that cac is required only for potentiation. Similarly, itpr seem to globally affect presynaptic activities.</p></disp-quote><p>Cac knockdown did not affect CSâ depression: CSâ depression was not observed in controls for this experiment. There are several differences between the control genotypes in these experiments: (1) Gal4 driver (238Y vs. [sparser] R13F02), (2) inclusion of Gal80<sup>ts</sup>, (3) temperature shifts for Gal80<sup>ts</sup> induction. One or more of these differences may have slightly altered the plasticity effects in controls, though the overall conclusions are consistent: appetitive conditioning potentiated the relative CS+/CSâ responses in the proximal Î³ compartments, while generating a trend toward decreasing responses in the distal compartments.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>- Some of the major findings here have been consistent with previous papers with different measurements (e.g. Bilz et al. 2020 for Figure 2). On the other hand, this study presents results not coherent with existing studies. For example, previous papers of the authors found rather homogeneous calcium increase (Boto 2014, Louis 2018), while plasticity in this study is graded along the y lobe axons and opposite in appetitive and aversive conditioning (Figure 1, 2).</p></disp-quote><p>Indeed, this is an important finding here â Ca<sup>2+</sup> in the presynaptic terminal is often, but not always, correlated with the directionality and magnitude of plasticity in ACh release across compartments. One inspiration for the present study was the independent lines of evidence suggesting presynaptic localization of plasticity associated with aversive learning (e.g., requirement for cAMP signaling molecules in KCs [e.g., Zars et al., 2000]) combined with our previous studies suggesting no net changes in odorâevoked Ca<sup>2+</sup> responses across MB Î³ compartments following aversive conditioning (at shortâterm time points). This is discussed in the Introduction (lines 63â67). These observations are not discrepancies, but rather reflect the different approaches used across the prior studies; the present data represent a step toward resolving these apparent discrepancies.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>MBON-y3 has been reported to be dispensable (Aso 2014 and Ichinose 2021) unlike the results in Figure 6E.

Among the candidate GABAergic MBONs listed in the figure legend, they only tested the Î³1pedc MBON in this particular assay. Ichinose et al. 2021 blocked MBONs in individual phases and tested at 1 hr, while we blocked across all phases and examined immediate memory. One of the major conclusions of their study was that multiple MBONs are involved in modulating reward memory. Given the differences in the approaches between the studies, we do not interpret the present results as necessarily inconsistent. Nonetheless, the paragraph describing the Î³3 MBON behavioral data in the discussion has been edited to discuss these points.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>- The choice of this particular cac RNAi strain is not clear, besides no control experiment for off-target effects.

Without these data, readers would be left to integrate conclusions across studies, assume that conditions were similar enough to compare across studies/labs, and extrapolate across multiple MBONs.

The most important data are the ÎF/F values, not the mean time series traces. The main effect is the presence of adaptation in the CSâ group and the odorâonly groups when knocking down IP<sub>3</sub>R/itpr.

To explicitly test whether IP<sub>3</sub>R knockdown increased the rate of olfactory adaptation, we tested a second protocol: presenting and imaging the odorâevoked ACh release from KCs in response to a 1âs odor pulse, delivered once per minute for 10 minutes. This protocol revealed increased adaptation in the IP<sub>3</sub>R knockdown group relative to (uninduced) controls (Figure 4 K,L, Figure 4 â Supplement 2), demonstrating that IP<sub>3</sub>R is required for maintenance of olfactory responses over time.</p><p>- L256 Sentence and/or figure citation are somewhat inconsistent.</p><p>The reviewer is correct (the figure was cited erroneously).

However, some of my concerns were not addressed. The authors need to clarify the following points before publication.</p><p>1. The odor-only control accounts for the effect of non-associative olfactory adaptation. But only that. The authors should be aware that other types of non-associative plasticity taking place during learning; e.g. reduced odor acuity by the previous exposure to electric shock (Preat, J Neurosci, 1998). Thus, inclusion of the US-only and/or unpaired training controls is mandatory to formally determine the absolute plasticity effect (e.g. potentiation of CS+ or depression CS- are indistinguishable; Figures 1L and 2K). Otherwise, they should moderate these claims, and focus only on the relative effects (i.e. &quot;CS+:CS-&quot; in the same figures)..</p></disp-quote><p>We have clarified and moderated the interpretation of the findings, noting that the comparison normalizes for nonâassociative olfactory adaptation, as the reviewer notes. This is done in multiple places, such as on page 5, which now reads: âThe Î(post/pre) of the CS+ and CSâ was compared to determine how each changed relative to the other, and then each was compared to its respective odorâonly control to quantify whether it was potentiated or depressed, accounting for any nonassociative olfactory adaptation (Figure 1 GâK, Figure 1 â Supplement 2).â</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>2. As demonstrated by the authors, Cac-KD reduces only ~29% of total Cac RNA level, suggesting that large body of Cac expression is unaffected. It is quite questionable that Cac is not required for learning-induced depression of Ach release (P10, L234) based on this partial down-regulation.</p></disp-quote><p>This is a valid point; we adjusted the language accordingly. It now reads: âOverall, these data suggest that moderate knockdown of Cac does not affect learningâinduced depression of ACh release (in contrast to potentiation).â</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>3. Somehow related to the previous point. Is it reasonable to conclude that Cac is required for learning-dependent potentiation? There is potentiation of CS- odor response in the Î³ 5 compartment after appetitive learning (Figure 3- sup1E)?</p></disp-quote><p>There is no statistically significant difference between the CSâ and the odorâonly control. Therefore, while we are intrigued by the quantitative increase in the CSâ response in this group (as the reviewer is), we are unable to ascribe it to an associative effect of conditioning.</p></body></sub-article></article>
