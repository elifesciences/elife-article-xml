sec-type="intro"><title>Introduction</title><p>Class-B1 G-protein-coupled receptors (GPCRs) represent an important sub-group of peptide-sensing GPCRs, that are the focus of intense and rapidly expanding drug development efforts (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Hauser et al., 2017</xref>), driven by extremely successful examples of peptide agonists used in the clinical treatment of metabolic human diseases, such as type-2 diabetes and obesity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib50">Wang et al., 2022b</xref>). One such peptide–GPCR system that has shown growing potential for targetability in the treatment of human disorders is the Pituitary Adenylate Cyclase Activating Peptide (ADCYAP1 or PACAP) and its receptors. PACAP is an endogenous 38-amino acid peptide that is among the most phylogenetically conserved peptides (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Johnson et al., 2020</xref>). Its shorter C-terminally truncated form (i.e., PACAP<sub>1-27</sub>) has 68% homology with the vasoactive intestinal peptide (VIP) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Dickson and Finlayson, 2009</xref>). In fact, VIP and PACAP share a subfamily of class-B1 GPCRs, of which the two receptors VPAC1 and VPAC2 can both be equipotently activated by VIP and PACAP (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Dickson and Finlayson, 2009</xref>). The third receptor in this subfamily, that is the PAC1 receptor (PAC1R, also known as ADCYAP1R1), however, has a reported affinity for PACAP that is 100- to 1000-fold higher than its affinity to VIP (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Dickson and Finlayson, 2009</xref>). The tissue distribution of PACAP and its receptors is widespread and they can be found throughout the central and peripheral nervous system, the immune system, in endocrine glands as well as in other organ systems and in many cancerous tissues (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Dickson and Finlayson, 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Hashimoto et al., 1996</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Condro et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">PACAP, 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Blechman and Levkowitz, 2013</xref>). A large body of evidence has linked the PACAP/PAC1R system to protective functions in the nervous and immune systems, as well as to stress- and anxiety-related behaviors (in particular post-traumatic stress disorder), migraine, nociception, thermoregulation, sleep/wake cycles, and reproductive functions (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Dickson and Finlayson, 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">PACAP, 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Biran et al., 2020</xref>), making it a peptide signaling system of high clinical relevance.</p><p>Recently, genetically encoded GPCR-based sensors have been developed that enable the direct optical detection of GPCR activation by agonist ligands with high sensitivity and spatiotemporal resolution (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">Patriarchi et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib41">Patriarchi et al., 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib40">Patriarchi et al., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib47">Sun et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib42">Peng et al., 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">Oe et al., 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Duffet et al., 2022</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Duffet et al., 2023</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Kagiampaki et al., 2023</xref>). While these tools hold great potential for drug development, pharmacology, and neuroscience applications, only a few of them are built from class-B1 peptide-sensing GPCRs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Duffet et al., 2023</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib49">Wang et al., 2022a</xref>). Thus, the development of new biosensors based on peptide-sensing GPCRs would greatly benefit the community and serve as a powerful resource for drug screening and life sciences.</p><p>In this work, we engineered PAClight1<sub>P78A</sub>, an ultrasensitive indicator based on the human PAC1 receptor (hmPAC1R). To establish this as a tool for peptide drug screening, we thoroughly characterized its dynamic range, as well as its optical, kinetic, signaling, and pharmacological properties in vitro. We further generated stable cell lines and compared them to transfected cells for ligand-induced fluorescence responses using flow cytometry. Additionally, we tested the potential of PAClight1<sub>P78A</sub> as a tool to study ligand binding and diffusion in animal models. To this end, we examined the sensitivity and specificity of PAClight1<sub>P78A</sub> in acute mouse brain slices in response to application of PACAP<sub>1-38</sub>. Moreover, we verified ligand detection in vivo using fiber photometry recording and intracerebral microinfusions in behaving mice.</p><p>Finally, we demonstrate that the sensor expresses well and produces a large fluorescent response to PACAP<sub>1-38</sub> following microinjection in the brain of living zebrafish larvae, opening new opportunities for the development and testing of drugs targeting this receptor in the central nervous system.</p><p>Overall, our new sensor expands the class of genetically encoded optical tools that can be used for GPCR-targeted HTS assays, reducing the demands on time and costly reagents, and provides new opportunities for functionally testing drugs that target the PAC1R pathway directly in living animals.</p></sec><sec id="s2" sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><sec id="s2-1"><title>Development of an ultrasensitive PAC1R-based sensor</title><p>To develop a highly sensitive indicator of hmPAC1R activation, we followed a protein engineering approach that we and others recently established (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">Patriarchi et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib47">Sun et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Duffet et al., 2022</xref>). We used the human PAC1Rnull splice isoform as a protein scaffold (hmPAC1R) and constructed an initial sensor prototype in which we replaced the entire third intracellular loop (ICL3, residues Q336–G342) with a module containing circularly permuted green fluorescent protein (cpGFP) from dLight1.3b (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">Patriarchi et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1a</xref>). This initial prototype construct, named PAClight0.1, was expressed on the surface of HEK293T cells, but showed clear intracellular retention and a very weak average fluorescent response to bath application of PACAP<sub>1-38</sub> (Δ<italic>F</italic>/<italic>F</italic><sub>0</sub> = 43.4%, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1b</xref>). Using this sensor as template, we conducted a small-scale screen to identify the optimal insertion site by reintroducing amino acids from the original ICL3 of hmPAC1R on both sides of the cpGFP module. This led us to the identification of a second mutant, in which Q336 was reintroduced before the cpGFP module, that showed improved average fluorescent response to the ligand (Δ<italic>F</italic>/<italic>F</italic><sub>0</sub> = 343%, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1c</xref>). To improve membrane expression of the PAClight mutants, we next investigated the effect of point mutations on their C-terminus, via site-directed mutagenesis. Mutation into alanine of residue T468, a reported post-translational modification site (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://www.phosphosite.org">https://www.phosphosite.org</ext-link>) on the C-terminus of the receptor (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Hornbeck et al., 2004</xref>), improved the overall surface expression of the sensor in HEK293T cells and further increased the observed average fluorescent response (Δ<italic>F</italic>/<italic>F</italic><sub>0</sub> = 516%, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1d–g</xref>). To further improve the fluorescent response of PAClight, we screened a subsequent library of sensor variants with mutations targeted to the second intracellular loop (ICL2). A similar approach was previously shown to boost the fluorescent response of other GPCR-based sensors, for example dLight1.3b or OxLight1 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">Patriarchi et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Duffet et al., 2022</xref>). Our functional screen of a library of ICL2 mutants led to the identification of one variant comprising three point mutations (F259K/F260K/P261K) that displayed a largely improved fluorescent response to PACAP<sub>1-38</sub> (Δ<italic>F</italic>/<italic>F</italic><sub>0</sub> = 942%, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1d–g</xref>). Upon introduction of the C-term T468A mutation on the ICL2 F259K/F260K/P261K background, we obtained an improved version of the sensor, named PAClight1, with excellent surface expression and fluorescent response (Δ<italic>F</italic>/<italic>F</italic><sub>0</sub> = 1037%, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1g</xref>). Given the high degree of sequence and structural similarity, as well as the broad activation of endogenous VPAC(VIP and PACAP receptors) receptors by VIP and PACAP (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Kobayashi et al., 2020</xref>), we next asked whether the hmPAC1R-based sensor would also respond to VIP. Indeed, application of a high concentration of VIP onto sensor-expressing cells caused a large fluorescent response, corresponding to more than half of the response to PACAP<sub>1-38</sub> (Δ<italic>F</italic>/<italic>F</italic><sub>0</sub> = 654%, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s2">Figure 1—figure supplement 2a, b</xref>). In an effort to eliminate the response to VIP and obtain a PACAP-specific sensor, we screened a small library of sensors containing single-point mutations into alanine that were inspired by simulations on the binding free energy of PACAP and VIP on the PAC1R (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Liao et al., 2021</xref>). Furthermore, at this stage we included the naturally occurring splice mutant PAC1R ‘short’ (reported to have lower affinity toward VIP; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Blechman and Levkowitz, 2013</xref>) into the extracellular ligand-binding domain (ECD) of the sensor, as well as two structure-guided point mutants. Through this screening, we identified a single mutation (P78A) that abolished the sensor response to VIP while leaving unaltered the response to PACAP<sub>1-38</sub> (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s2">Figure 1—figure supplement 2c, d</xref>). The final sensor construct, named PAClight1<sub>P78A</sub> (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1a, b</xref>, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="supp1">Supplementary file 1</xref>), includes all the above-mentioned mutations and combines a very large dynamic range with excellent PACAP selectivity and good membrane expression, and was thus selected for further in vitro characterization.</p><fig-group><fig id="fig1" position="float"><label>Figure 1.</label><caption><title>Design and in vitro optical properties of PAClight1<sub>P78A</sub>.</title><p>(<bold>a</bold>) Protein structure of PAClight1<sub>P78A</sub> as predicted by AlphaFold2 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Jumper et al., 2021</xref>).

Given that all class-B1 GPCRs share a similar ECD high-affinity ligand-binding mechanism, we performed similar experiments to determine whether PAClight1<sub>P78A</sub> could also be used in a similar manner.

Within 45–50 frames after application of the PAC1R antagonist, the signal intensity steadily decreased and started to plateau slightly above baseline levels.

Therefore, the response of PAClight1<sub>P78A</sub> to VIP in this specificity screen was also not significantly above baseline (57% Δ<italic>F</italic>/<italic>F</italic><sub>0</sub>, <italic>t</italic><sub>(2)</sub> = 11.09, 95% CI [0.35, 0.79], p = 0.12). Other peptides tested in this screen included other class-B1 GPCR ligands (corticotropin-releasing factor (CRF), parathyroid hormone (PTH), and glucagon-like peptide 1 (GLP-1)), as well as some peptidergic class-A GPCR ligands (oxytocin (OXY), orexin-A and -B (OXA–OXB), melanin-concentrating hormone (MCH), dynorphin (DYN), enkephalin (ENK), nociception (N-OFQ), neuropeptide FF (NPFF), neuropeptide S (NPS), neurotensin (NT), and neuromedin B (NB)). None of these neuropeptides activated the PAClight1<sub>P78A</sub> sensor above baseline level (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2b</xref>). Taken together, these results highlight the broad potential applicability of the PAClight1<sub>P78A</sub> sensor for use in model systems across the phylogenetic tree, as well as its high selectivity for PACAP ligands over VIP and other peptide GPCR ligands.</p><p>In order not to induce artificial PACAP signaling and potentially interfere with downstream readouts when using PAClight1<sub>P78A</sub>, it is important to verify that the sensor does not recruit G proteins and/or β-arrestin. To monitor the capacity of PACLight1<sub>P78A</sub> to engage these intracellular signaling partners, we performed split NanoLuc complementation assays as in our previous work (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Duffet et al., 2022</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Kagiampaki et al., 2023</xref>), using either PAClight1<sub>P78A</sub>-SmBiT or, as a positive control, PAC1R-SmBiT fusion constructs, together with LgBiT-miniGs (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s1">Figure 2—figure supplement 1a</xref>), LgBiT-miniGsq (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s1">Figure 2—figure supplement 1b</xref>), or LgBiT-β-arrestin2 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s1">Figure 2—figure supplement 1c</xref>). As expected, we observed significant miniGs, miniGsq, and β-arrestin2 recruitment to the wild-type PAC1R upon activation with 1 μM of PACAP<sub>1-38</sub>. Yet, we did not detect recruitment of either miniGs, miniGsq, or β-arrestin2 in PAClight1<sub>P78A</sub>-expressing cells upon stimulation with PACAP<sub>1-38</sub>. These results indicate that expression of PAClight1<sub>P78A</sub> does not artificially induce PACAP-mediated intracellular signaling and is not likely to interfere with endogenous signaling pathways.</p></sec><sec id="s2-3"><title>Development of non-responsive PAClight1 control sensors</title><p>When employing GPCR sensors in intact living tissue (e.g., when used in animal models) it is often desirable to make use of an appropriate control sensor, in which ligand binding is abolished by virtue of one or more point mutations in the GPCR-binding pocket. To engineer such control sensors for our PAClight1<sub>P78A</sub> and PAClight1 sensors, we targeted key residues in the hmPAC1R that interact with residue D3 in PACAP. The carboxylic group of D3 was shown to be crucial for binding affinity and biological activity of PACAP to all three receptor types (i.e., PAC1, VPAC1, and VPAC2) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Doan et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Bourgault et al., 2009</xref>). Furthermore, the cryo-EM structure of the hmPAC1R in interaction with PACAP identified residues Y161 and R199 of the hmPAC1R to interact with residue D3 of PACAP (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Kobayashi et al., 2020</xref>). Residue Y161 forms a hydrogen bond with D3, while R199 forms an electrostatic interaction with D3 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s2">Figure 2—figure supplement 2a, b</xref>). To abolish these interactions, we first mutated R199 into alanine (R199A) on the backbone of PAClight1. This single-point mutant showed drastically reduced average fluorescent response (PAClight1: 1075% Δ<italic>F</italic>/<italic>F</italic><sub>0</sub>, PAClight1_R199A: 41.9% Δ<italic>F</italic>/<italic>F</italic><sub>0</sub>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s2">Figure 2—figure supplement 2c</xref>) to 10 μM PACAP<sub>1-38</sub>. To further abolish the remaining response, we additionally mutated Y161 into alanine (Y161A) on the previous backbone (i.e., PAClight1_R199A_Y161A) and named the construct ‘PAClight1-ctrl’. This completely reduced the fluorescent response to PACAP<sub>1-38</sub> to baseline levels (PAClight1-ctrl: 2.87% Δ<italic>F</italic>/<italic>F</italic><sub>0</sub>). Next, we cloned these two point mutations into the backbone of PAClight1<sub>P78A</sub> and observed an equally abolished fluorescent response to PACAP<sub>1-38</sub> (PAClight1<sub>P78A</sub>: 1034% Δ<italic>F</italic>/<italic>F</italic><sub>0</sub>, PAClight1<sub>P78A</sub>-ctrl: 10.44% Δ<italic>F</italic>/<italic>F</italic><sub>0</sub>, <italic>t</italic><sub>(4.03)</sub> = 37.89, p &lt; 0.0001, 95% CI [1098.63, 949.02], two-sided two-sample Welch’s <italic>t</italic> test, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s2">Figure 2—figure supplement 2d</xref>) in transfected HEK293T cells, as well as in virally transduced rat primary neuron cultures (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s2">Figure 2—figure supplement 2e</xref>).

To obtain a quantitative comparison, we decided to produce a stable T-Rex HEK293 cell line for inducible expression of PAClight1 (mutant missing P78A ECD mutation). We then used flow cytometry to record multiple replicates of 100,000 cells, and compared their fluorescence intensity to that of a similarly generated cell line expressing the indicator dLight1.3b, which we previously described (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Klein Herenbrink et al., 2022</xref>; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2c, d</xref>).

To verify that this is indeed the case, we analyzed PACLight1<sub>P78A</sub>-expressing stable cells and compared them to transfected cells using flow cytometry. While a large proportion of cells from the transfected condition expressed the sensor at very low levels or not at all (i.e., were left shifted in the density plot), we also observed a significant proportion of very bright and strongly expressing cells from within the same condition. In fact, there is higher abundance of very bright and strongly expressing cells in the transfected condition than in the induced stable cell line condition (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3a</xref>). The combination of the higher abundance of very low expression levels and very high expression levels within the transfected condition leads to a significantly increased variability of observed expression levels compared to the induced stable cell line condition. The median of the standard deviation in the FITC-A channel across the titration series was 62.6% smaller in the stable PAClight1<sub>P78A</sub> relative to the transfected PAClight1<sub>P78A</sub> condition (p = 0.0142, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3b</xref>).

Two of the sensors that we developed (PAClight1 and PAClight1<sub>P78A</sub>) exhibit a very high dynamic range (above 1000% Δ<italic>F</italic>/<italic>F</italic><sub>0</sub>), excellent expression at the cell surface, high basal brightness, and retain the pharmacological profile and ligand-binding profile of the parent receptor, with the exception of PAClight1<sub>P78A</sub> whose response to VIP is intentionally abolished via a single-point mutation. Given the very high sensitivity of these tools, future work could explore whether a grafting-based approach, similar to the one we recently described for class-A GPCR-based sensors (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Kagiampaki et al., 2023</xref>), could lead to the direct generation of multiple class-B1 sensors based on the optimized fluorescent protein module from PAClight.</p><p>As part of this sensor family, we also introduced a control sensor harboring the two-point mutations R199A and Y161A, in which the response to PACAP<sub>1-38</sub> is abolished. Given the higher PACAP selectivity of PAClight1<sub>P78A</sub>, this sensor variant is intended to be employed when there is an experimental need to ensure maximal selectivity of the response for the endogenous ligand PACAP<sub>1-38</sub> (e.g., if the sensor is to be used for attempting the detection of endogenous PACAP<sub>1-38</sub> release). For all other experimental scenarios, PAClight1 can be a better choice, as it retains the original wild-type sequence in its ECD and thus most closely represents the natural ligand-binding profile of the human PAC1 receptor.</p><p>Importantly, we demonstrate successful expression and functionality of PAClight1<sub>P78A</sub> and PAClight1<sub>P78A</sub>-ctrl in the mouse brain by injecting AAVs encoding the sensor stereotactically. Additionally, our experiments in zebrafishes and mice revealed intriguing inter- and intraindividual differences in maximal sensor response to ICV and intracranial injections of the peptide ligand. These differences could potentially stem from variances in the expression density of PAClight1<sub>P78A</sub> within single cells. An intriguing alternative explanation, supported by the observation of continuously increasing Δ<italic>F</italic>/<italic>F</italic><sub>0</sub> levels (at least within the first 15 min), is that variations in diffusion rates and spatial diffusion patterns of PACAP<sub>1-38</sub> within the brain parenchyma and cortical tissue may contribute to these differences. Furthermore, the distance between PAClight1<sub>P78A</sub> -expressing cells and the site of injection might influence the extent of fluorescent response. Under more controlled experimental conditions, PAClight1/PAClight1<sub>P78A</sub> -expressing zebrafishes and mice could therefore potentially be used to investigate and validate diffusion properties of PAC1R ligands in live organisms at a relatively high throughput or to screen for novel small-molecule or peptide PAC1R agonists and antagonists with improved penetration properties across the ventricular wall.</p><p>Consistent with our findings in zebrafish, PACAP<sub>1-38</sub> microinjections into the mouse cortex revealed slow increases in Δ<italic>F</italic>/<italic>F</italic><sub>0</sub> levels even when PACAP<sub>1-38</sub> was injected only 100 s of µm away from the recording site, substantiating the hypothesis of slow diffusion of PACAP<sub>1-38</sub> through brain tissue. Furthermore, our results show a sustained activity with a slow decay of PAClight<sub>P78A</sub> fluorescence, especially at high concentrations. We hypothesize that this delayed decay may result from the slow clearance of peptides from extracellular space, putatively due to saturation of the enzymatic degradation system. An alternative explanation could be a long-lasting activation of PAC1 after binding of PACAP<sub>1-38</sub>. This explanation is substantiated by slow decay in our slice experiments and by previous findings that PACAP<sub>1-38</sub> effects on downstream PKA signaling is longer lasting than effects of two other tested peptides (VIP and CRH) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Hu et al., 2011</xref>).</p><p>Notably, in this work, we did not demonstrate the use of any of our PAClight sensors for the detection of endogenous PACAP release in tissues or animal models, as our focus was deliberately set on the characterization and validation of the tools for applications to drug screening and/or development across species. Future work could focus on employing these tools to test whether or not they could be suitable for detecting endogenous PACAP dynamics with high spatiotemporal resolution in tissues or awake behaving animals. Based on our observations from mouse slice and in vivo recordings, bulk or epifluorescent imaging is unlikely to reveal endogenous release of PACAP, given that measured peptide concentrations typically occur in the femtomolar to nanomolar range (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">Palkovits et al., 1995</xref>). However, further optimization of the sensor to increase sensitivity and brightness coupled with the use of two-photon imaging that allows to focus on PAClight-expressing cell membranes nearby PACAP release sites, holds promise for future application of this sensor for in vivo detection of endogenously released PACAP. Considering the slow diffusion of PACAP<sub>1-38</sub> observed in our in vivo experiments, it will be quintessential to record PACAP release close to the main sites of action to capture physiologically relevant temporal dynamics. This could be achieved for example also by expressing the sensor exclusively in cells that express PACAP-sensitive receptors (PAC1, VPAC1, and VPAC2) and then trigger PACAP release via optogenetic stimulation or behavioral paradigms.</p><p>Our results show that the new tools introduced in this study can be valuable assets to investigate real-time dynamics of PAC1 receptor activation in response to the application of specific PAC1 receptor agents, both at a cellular level and in vivo in zebrafish and in the mammalian brain. The in vivo validation of our sensor demonstrates its ability to reveal diffusion dynamics of applied drugs and peptides within brain tissue. We therefore suggest that this tool can be employed in applications such as studying the diffusion of novel PAC1-targeting drugs and peptides, thereby offering mechanistic insights into the localization of drug actions in the brain.</p></sec><sec id="s4" sec-type="methods"><title>Methods</title><table-wrap id="keyresource" position="anchor"><label>Key resources table</label><table frame="hsides" rules="groups"><thead><tr><th align="left" valign="bottom">Reagent type (species) or resource</th><th align="left" valign="bottom">Designation</th><th align="left" valign="bottom">Source or reference</th><th align="left" valign="bottom">Identifiers</th><th align="left" valign="bottom">Additional information</th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td align="left" valign="bottom">Strain, strain background (<italic>Escherichia coli</italic>)</td><td align="left" valign="bottom">NEB 10 Beta</td><td align="left" valign="bottom">New England Biolabs</td><td align="left" valign="bottom">C3019H</td><td align="left" valign="bottom">N/A</td></tr><tr><td align="left" valign="bottom">Cell line (<italic>Homo sapiens</italic>)</td><td align="left" valign="bottom">HEK293T</td><td align="left" valign="bottom">ATCC</td><td align="left" valign="bottom">CRL-3216</td><td align="left" valign="bottom">N/A</td></tr><tr><td align="left" valign="bottom">Cell line (<italic>Homo sapiens</italic>)</td><td align="left" valign="bottom">Flp-In T-REx 293 cells</td><td align="left" valign="bottom">Thermo Fisher</td><td align="left" valign="bottom">R78007</td><td align="left" valign="bottom">N/A</td></tr><tr><td align="left" valign="bottom">Commercial assay or kit</td><td align="left" valign="bottom">Nano-Glo Live Cell Reagent</td><td align="left" valign="bottom">Promega</td><td align="left" valign="bottom">N2011</td><td align="left" valign="bottom">N/A</td></tr><tr><td align="left" valign="bottom">Commercial assay or kit</td><td align="left" valign="bottom">Lipofectamine 2000</td><td align="left" valign="bottom">Thermo Fisher</td><td align="left" valign="bottom">11668019</td><td align="left" valign="bottom">N/A</td></tr><tr><td align="left" valign="bottom">Commercial assay or kit</td><td align="left" valign="bottom">Effectene</td><td align="left" valign="bottom">QIAGEN</td><td align="left" valign="bottom">301425</td><td align="left" valign="bottom">N/A</td></tr><tr><td align="left" valign="bottom">Chemical compound, drug</td><td align="left" valign="bottom">PACAP<sub>1-38</sub></td><td align="left" valign="bottom">Sigma-Aldrich</td><td align="left" valign="bottom">A1439</td><td align="left" valign="bottom">N/A</td></tr><tr><td align="left" valign="bottom">Software, algorithm</td><td align="left" valign="bottom">Fiji</td><td align="left" valign="bottom">ImageJ</td><td align="left" valign="bottom">2.15.1</td><td align="left" valign="bottom"><ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://imagej.net/software/fiji/">https://imagej.net/software/fiji/</ext-link></td></tr><tr><td align="left" valign="bottom">Software, algorithm</td><td align="left" valign="bottom">R studio</td><td align="left" valign="bottom">Posit</td><td align="left" valign="bottom">2023.09.1</td><td align="left" valign="bottom"><ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://posit.co/downloads/">https://posit.co/downloads/</ext-link></td></tr></tbody></table></table-wrap><sec id="s4-1"><title>Molecular cloning</title><p>A synthetic DNA geneblock for the human PAC1R-null receptor sequence (PAC1R) was designed and ordered (Life Technologies) based on the NCBI protein data bank entry ‘NP_001109.2’.

A hemagglutinin signal peptide (MKTIIALSYIFCLVFA) was introduced 5′ to the PAC1R-coding sequence. Circular Polymerase Extension Cloning was used to replace the intracellular loop 3 (Q336–G342) of PAC1R with a cpGFP module from dLight1 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">Patriarchi et al., 2018</xref>). For sensor optimization, libraries of sensor variants were created through site-directed mutagenesis. For signaling assays, a linker + SmBit sequence (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Laschet et al., 2019</xref>) (GNSGSSGGGGSGGGGSSGG + VTGWRLCERILA) was cloned at the 3′end of both the PAClight1<sub>P78A</sub> and the PAC1R sequence. The XhoI cleavage site from within the SmBit linker sequence and the first four residues of the SmBit linker (GNSG) were first cloned into the 3′end of the PAClight1<sub>P78A</sub> and PAC1R sequences using PCR. Subsequently, a restriction digest using XhoI and XbaI restriction enzymes was performed on the SmBit containing plasmid (B2AR-SmBit) as well as on the pCMV_PAClight1<sub>P78A</sub> and pCMV_PAC1R plasmids. Ligation of the linker + SmBit insert into the linearized backbones was performed after gel extraction and purification of the insert. For generation of stably expressing and inducible Flp-In T-REx 293 cells, the PAClight1<sub>P78A</sub> and PAClight1 sequences were cloned into the pcDNA5/FRT/TO backbone, respectively, using restriction digest with BamHI and NotI restriction enzymes. PCR reactions were performed using a Pfu-Ultra II Fusion High Fidelity DNA Polymerase (Agilent), whereas Gibson Assembly was performed using NEBuilder HiFi DNA Assembly Master Mix (New England Biolabs).

Cells were transfected at 50–60% confluency in glass-bottomed dishes using the Effectene transfection kit (QIAGEN) according to the manufacturer’s instructions, and imaged 24–48 hr after transfection, as previously described (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Duffet et al., 2022</xref>). Primary cultured hippocampal neurons were prepared and transduced as previously described (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Kagiampaki et al., 2023</xref>). Before imaging, all cells were rinsed with 1 ml of Hank’s Balanced Salt Solution (Life Technologies) supplemented with Ca<sup>2+</sup> (2 mM) and Mg<sup>2+</sup> (1 mM). Time-lapse imaging was performed at room temperature (22°C) on an inverted Zeiss LSM 800 confocal microscope using either a ×40 oil-based or a ×20 air objective. Longer-term imaging for determination of internalization/stability as well as reversibility was performed using a ×10 air objective, with 1 frame (1024 × 1024 pixels) acquired every minute (2× pixel averaging). Imaging was performed using a 488-nm laser as excitation light source for PAClight1 sensors. During imaging, ligands were added in bolus on the cells using a micropipette to reach the final specified concentrations of ligands on the cells. For quantification of recordings in single dishes, an average intensity projection across the whole temporal stack was first generated. Pixel-intensity-based thresholding in Fiji was then performed manually on the average intensity projection to segment the plasma membrane as accurately as possible. Using the magic wand tool from Fiji, connected patches of segmented plasma membranes (sampled from multiple cells) were selected as ROIs. The ROIs were then projected onto the temporal stack to make sure the plasma membrane did not drift out of the ROI during the time lapse recording.

To obtain a cell line with stably integrated PAClight1<sub>P78A</sub> or PAClight1 expression cassettes, cells were grown in T150 flasks (Corning) until 70% confluency, were then transfected with 0.6 µg of pcDNA5/FRT/TO-PAClight1<sub>P78A</sub> DNA vector and 5.4 µg pOG44 vector using Effectene transfection kit (QIAGEN).

Stable HEK293_PAClight1<sub>P78A</sub>/PAClight1 cells were induced with 1 µg/ml doxycycline (Sigma) at 50–60% confluency.

Palleted cells were then resuspended in ice-cold FACS buffer containing 1× PBS, 1 mM EDTA, 25 mM HEPES (pH 7.0), 1% FBS and diluted to 4–4.8 × 10<sup>6</sup> cells/ml. A dilution series of PACAP<sub>1-8</sub> and VIP was prepared in FACS buffer. 125 µl of peptide solution was pipetted into a 96-well format and another 125 µl of cell suspension was added to each well. The 96-well U-bottom plate was then loaded into a BD FACS Canto II cytometer equipped with a high-throughput sampler for 96-well format sampling. Voltage for the photomultiplier tubes was set to 200 V for the forward scatter detector, to 400 V for the side scatter detector, and to 350 V for the FITC channel fluorescence detector. Excitation was performed at 488 nm, while emission was directed through a 502LP mirror and a 530/30 band pass filter. Sampling from 96-well format wells was performed with an initial mixing step (3 × 100 µl mixes at 150 µl/s) followed by sample acquisition of 200 µl at a flow rate of 1–3 µl/s. Sampling was performed until 100 K events were recorded per well. After sample acquisition of each well, a 800-µl wash step of the sampling line was performed. Sample acquisition within a dilution series replicate was performed from low-to-high concentrations to minimize potential peptide carry-over into the neighboring wells. Furthermore, a minimum of six wells without PACAP or VIP present were sampled between each replicate of the same construct. Raw data were exported in FCS3.1 format and further processed for analysis within R. The following R packages were used for the analysis and visualization of the flow cytometry experiments: flowCore, flowAI, ggcyto, dplyr, tidyr, forcats, purrr, stringr, openCyto, openxlsx, svglite, ggprism, ggnewscale, and glue. After import of the raw datasets, a rectangular gate (Cells) was defined on a FSC-A vs. SSC-A scatter plot with the limits being set to 25K- and 15K-infinity, respectively. Next, a ‘Singlet’ gate within the parent gate ‘Cells’ was created automatically using the openCyto::singletGate function based on the FSC-A vs. FSC-H scatter plot. MFIs of the FITC-A channel for all recorded events within the ‘Singlet’ gate were calculated for each well.

Lidocaine (3.5 mg/kg; Gebro Pharma, #100562 1404) and Carprofen (4 mg/kg; Zoetis, #256684) were administered subcutaneously for local anesthesia and general analgesia. A small craniotomy was made bilaterally, targeting the temporal neocortex (Injection site at −4.1 mm posterior to bregma, as lateral as possible and 1.2 mm ventral to the pial surface). A glass micropipette was used for virus delivery and inserted slowly into the brain. Before and after virus delivery, the micropipette was kept in place for a waiting time of 8 min. 100–200 nl of AAV9.hSyn.PAClight1<sub>P78A</sub> or AAV9.hSyn.PAClight1<sub>P78A</sub>-ctrl were injected, with an injection rate of 40 nl/min using a microsyringe pump (KD Scientific; #788110). The pipette was withdrawn slowly and the skin of the skull was sutured. The mice were allowed to recover for 4 weeks before being used for the experiments, with Carprofen (4 mg/kg) being administered on the 2 consecutive days after the surgery.</p></sec><sec id="s4-12"><title>Slice imaging</title><p>The mice were deeply anesthetized with isoflurane before being sacrificed by a transcardial perfusion with 30 ml cooled sucrose solution (212 mM sucrose, 3 mM KCl, 1.25 mM Na<sub>2</sub>H<sub>2</sub>PO<sub>4</sub>, 26 mM NaHCO<sub>3</sub>, 1 mM MgCl<sub>2</sub>, 0.2 mM CaCl<sub>2</sub>, 10 mM glucose) oxygenated with carbogen gas. The mice were decapitated and the brain was dissected out. 300 µM coronal slices were prepared using a Leica VT1200 vibratome in cold oxygenated sucrose solution (0.12 mm/s, 0.8 mm amplitude). The slices were incubated in oxygenated Ringer’s solution (125 mM NaCl, 25 mM NaHCO<sub>3</sub>, 1.25 mM NaH<sub>2</sub>PO<sub>4</sub>, 2.5 mM KCl, 2 mM CaCl<sub>2</sub>, 1 mM MgCl<sub>2</sub>, 25 mM glucose) at 37°C for 10 min and afterwards kept at room temperature. The slices were imaged using an Olympus BX51WI microscope with an ORCA-Fusion Digital CMOS camera (Hamamatsu, #C14440-20UP) and a ×10 objective (UMPLFLN10XW objective, Olympus). An EGFP(green fluorescent protein) filterset was used to control emission and excitation spectra (470/40, 525/50; AFH #F46-002). Micromanager software (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Edelstein et al., 2014</xref>) was used to synchronize the excitation LED with the camera shutter. Videos were taken at 4 Hz framerate using 100ms exposure time per frame. Cortical areas with clearly visible baseline fluorescence were selected for imaging. Baseline recordings of 10–20 min were performed prior to data acquisition to allow the slices to accustom to the conditions. Bath temperature was set to ~31 °C. The experimental recording was 20 min long, with the respective peptide being infused from 3 to 5 min. The following peptides were used: PACAP<sub>1-38</sub> (30–3000 nM; Phoenix Pharmaceuticals; #052-05), VIP (3000 nM; Phoenix Pharmaceuticals; #064-16), CRF (3000 nM; Phoenix Pharmaceuticals; #019-06), and Met-Enkephalin (3000 nM; Phoenix Pharmaceuticals; #024-35). Of note, since our preliminary data suggested a decrease in PAClight1<sub>P78A</sub> fluorescence in response to 3 µM CRF, we enriched the Ringer’s solution with synaptic transmission and neuronal activity blockers (NBQX, CPP, CGP 55845, Gabazine, and TTX) to prevent recruitment of neuronal circuits that could lead to endogenous PACAP<sub>1-38</sub> release (Tocris, biotechne; #Tocris 1262/50, #Tocris 0373/50, #Tocris0247/50, #Tocris 1248/50, #Tocris 1069/1).</p><p>Data analysis was performed using a custom-written Matlab script.

Indeed, in many cases initial versions of genetically encoded sensors undergo substantial development post-publication, as exemplified by the evolution of GCaMP. However, the situation with the PAClight sensor reported here requires a different approach. Unlike GCaMP, which was one of the first genetically encoded calcium indicators, PAClight is another variant in a series of GPCR-fluorophore conjugates, following methodologies similar to those developed in the Lin Tian lab and the multiple GRAB-based sensors from Yulong Li's lab.

This clarification will ensure that the manuscript accurately reflects the sensor's current capabilities and scope of use.</p></body></sub-article><sub-article article-type="author-comment"

the authors’ response to the original reviews.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p><bold>Public Reviews:</bold></p><p><bold>Reviewer #1 (Public Review):</bold></p><p>Summary:</p><p>The manuscript &quot;Engineering of PAClight1P78A: A High-Performance Class-B1 GPCR-Based Sensor for PACAP1-38&quot; by Cola et al. presents the development of a novel genetically encoded sensor, PAClight1P78A, based on the human PAC1 receptor. The authors provide a thorough in vitro and in vivo characterization of this sensor, demonstrating its potential utility across various applications in life sciences, including drug development and basic research.</p><p>The diverse methods to validate PAClight1P78A demonstrate a comprehensive approach to sensor engineering by combining biochemical characterization with in vivo studies in rodent brains and zebrafish. This establishes the sensor's biophysical properties (e.g., sensitivity, specificity, kinetics, and spectral properties) and demonstrates its functionality in physiologically relevant settings. Importantly, the inclusion of control sensors and the testing of potential intracellular downstream effects such as G-protein activation underscore a careful consideration of specificity and biological impact.</p><p>Strengths:</p><p>The fundamental development of PAClight1P78A addresses a significant gap in sensors for Class-B1 GPCRs. The iterative design process -starting from PAClight0.1 to the final PAClight1P78A variant - demonstrates compelling optimization. The innovative engineering results in a sensor with a high apparent dynamic range and excellent ligand selectivity, representing a significant advancement in the field. The rigorous in vitro characterization, including dynamic range, ligand specificity, and activation kinetics, provides a critical understanding of the sensor's utility. Including in vivo experiments in mice and zebrafish larvae demonstrates the sensor's applicability in complex biological systems.</p><p>Weaknesses:</p><p>The manuscript shows that the sensor fundamentally works in vivo, albeit in a limited capacity. The titration curves show sensitivity in the nmol range at which endogenous detection might be possible. However, perhaps the sensor is not sensitive enough or there are not any known robust paradigms for PACAP release. A more detailed discussion of the sensors's limitations, particularly regarding in vivo applications and the potential for detecting endogenous PACAP release, would be helpful.</p></disp-quote><p>We thank the reviewer for carefully analyzing our in vivo data and highlighting the limitation of our results regarding the sensor’s applicability in detecting endogenous PACAP. We added several sections conversing future possibilities for optimization in the discussion (see paragraphs 2-4). We agree that a more specific discussion of the limitations of our study is an important addition to help design future experiments.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>There are several experiments with an n=1 and other low single-digit numbers. I assume that refers to biological replicates such as mice or culture wells, but it is not well defined. n=1 in experimental contexts, particularly in Figure 1, raises significant concerns about the exact dynamic range of the sensor, data reproducibility, and the robustness of conclusions drawn from these experiments. Also, ROI for cell cultures, like in Figure 1, is not well defined. The methods mentioned ROIs were manually selected, which appears very selective, and the values in Figure 1c become unnecessarily questionable. The lack of definition for &quot;ROI&quot; is confusing. Do ROIs refer to cells, specific locations on the cell membrane, or groups of cells? It would be best if the authors could use unbiased methods for image analysis that include the majority of responsive areas or an explanation of why certain ROIs are included or excluded.</p></disp-quote><p>We thank the reviewer for the helpful suggestions. We have increased the number of replicates to n=3 for both HEK293T and neuron data depicted in Fig.1c. Furthermore, we have added Fig.1c’ containing the quantification of the maximum responses obtained in the dataset shown in Fig.1c also depicting the single values for each replicate. To clarify the definition of an ROI in our manuscript, we have detailed the process of ROI selection in the Methods section “Cell culture, imaging and quantification section”. Additionally, we also increased mouse numbers for in vivo PACAP infusions in mice (see Figure 4g).</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p><bold>Reviewer #2 (Public Review):</bold></p><p>Summary:</p><p>The PAClight1 sensor was developed using an approach successful for the development of other fluorescence-based GPCR sensors, which is the complete replacement of the third intracellular loop of the receptor with a circularly-permuted green fluorescent protein. When expressed in HEK cells, this sensor showed good expression and a weak but measurable response to the extracellular presence of PACAP1-38 a</p><p>F/Fo of 43%. Additional mutation near the site of insertion of the linearized GPF, at the C-terminus of the receptor, and within the second intracellular loop produced a final optimized sensor with F/Fo of &gt;1000%. Finally, screening of mutational libraries that also included alterations in the extracellular ligand-binding domain of the receptor yielded a molecule, PAClight1P78A, that exhibited a high ligand-dependent fluorescence response combined with a high differential sensitivity to PACAP (EC50 30 nM based on cytometric sorting of stably transfected HEK293 cells) compared to its congener VIP, (with which PACAP shares two highly related receptors, VPAC1 and VPAC2) as well as several unrelated neuropeptides, and significantly slowed activation kinetics by PACAP in the presence of a 10-fold molar excess of the PAC1 antagonist PACAP6-38. A structurally highly similar control construct, PAClight1P78Actl, showed correspondingly similar basal expression in HEK293 cells, but no PACAP-dependent enhancement in fluorescent properties.</p><p>PAClight1P78A was expressed in neurons of the mouse cortex via AAV9.hSyn-mediated gene transduction. Slices taken from PAClight1P78A-transfected cortex, but not slices taken from PAClight1P78Actl-transfected cortex exhibited prompt and persistent elevation of F/Fo after 2 minutes of perfusion with PACAP1-38 which persisted for up to 14 minutes and was statistically significant after perfusion with 3000, but not 300 or 30 nM, of peptide. Likewise, microinfusion of 200 nL of 300 uM PACAP1-38 into the cortex of optical fiber-implanted freely moving mice elicited a F/Fo (%) of greater than 15, and significantly higher than that elicited by application of similar concentrations of VIP, CRF, or enkephalin, or vehicle alone. In vivo experiments were carried out in zebrafish larvae by the introduction of PAClight1P78A into single-cell stage <italic>Danio rerio</italic> embryos using a Tol2 transposase-based plasmid with a UAS promoter via injection (of plasmid and transposase mRNA), and sorting of post-fertilization embryos using a marker for transgenesis carried in the UAS :</p><p>PAClight1P78A construct. Expression of PAClight1P78A was directed to cells in the olfactory bulb which express the fish paralog of the human PAC1 receptor by using the Tg(GnRH3:gal4ff) line, and fluorescent signals were elicited by intracerebroventricular administration of PACAP1-38 at a single concentration (1 mM), which were specific to PACAP and to the presence of PAClight1P78A per se, as controlled by parallel experiments in which PAClight1P78Actl instead of PAClight1P78A was contained in the transgenic plasmid.</p><p>Major strengths and weaknesses of the methods and results</p><p>The report represents a rigorous demonstration of the elicitation of fluorescent signals upon pharmacological exposure to PACAP in nervous system tissue expressing PAClight1P78A in both mammals (mice) and fish (zebrafish larvae). Figure 4d shows a change in GFP fluorescence activation by PACAP occurring several seconds after the cessation of PACAP perfusion over a two-minute period, and its persistence for several minutes following. One wonders if one is apprehending the graphical presentation of the data incorrectly, or if the activation of fluorescence efficiency by ligand presentation is irreversible in this context, in which case the utility of the probe as a real-time indicator, in vivo, of released peptide might be diminished.</p></disp-quote><p>We thank the reviewer for their careful consideration of our manuscript and agree that the activation of PAClight persisting for several minutes at micromolar concentrations could be a potential limitation for in vivo applications. We added a possible explanation for the persisting sensor activation in response to artificial application of PACAP38 in paragraph 3 of the discussion. We agree that this addition eases the interpretation of PAClight signals detected in vivo.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Appraisal of achievement of aims, and data support of conclusions:</p><p>Small cavils with controls are omitted for clarity; the larger issue of appraisal of results based on the scope of the designed experiments is discussed in the section below. An interesting question related to the time dependence of the PACAP-elicited activation of PAClight1P87A is its onset and reversibility, and additional data related to this would be welcome.</p></disp-quote><p>We agree that the reversibility of the sensor’s fluorescence is indeed an important feature especially for detecting endogenous PACAP release. Our data indicate that the sensor’s fluorescence is reversible when detecting small to medium doses of PACAP38 (see Figure 4d – Application of 30-300nM) that are presumably closer to physiological concentrations than the non-reversible concentration of 3000nM. Please, see also our new discussion on peptide concentrations in paragraph 4 of our discussion. For future experiments, it is indeed advisable to adjust the interval of repeated applications to the decay of the response at the respective concentration. Considering, the long-lasting downstream effects of endogenous signaling, longer intervals between ligand applications are generally preferred to match more closely the physiological range in which endogenous PAC1 is most likely affective.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Discussion of the impact of the work, and utility of the methods and data:</p><p>Increasingly, neurotransmitter function may be observed in vivo, rather than by inferring in vivo function from in vitro, in cellular, or ex vivo experimentation. This very valuable report discloses the invention of a genetically encoded sensor for the class B1 GPCR PAC1. PAC1 is the major receptor for the neuropeptide PACAP, which in turn is a major neurotransmitter involved in brain response to psychogenic stress, or threat, in vertebrates as diverse as mammals and fishes. If this sensor possesses the sensitivity to detect endogenously released PACAP in vivo it will indeed be an impactful tool for understanding PACAP neurotransmission (and indeed PACAP action in general, in immune and endocrine compartments as well) in future experiments.</p><p>However, the sensor has not yet been used to detect endogenously released PACAP. Until this has been done, one cannot answer the question as to whether the levels of exogenously perfused/administered PACAP used here merely to calibrate the sensor's sensitivity are indeed unphysiologically high. If endogenous PACAP levels don't get that high, then the sensor will not be useful for its intended purpose. The authors should address this issue and allude to what kind of experiments would need to be done in order to detect endogenous PACAP release in living tissue in intact animals. The authors could comment upon the success of other GPCR sensors that have been used to observe endogenous ligand release, and where along the pathway to becoming a truly useful reagent this particular sensor is.</p></disp-quote><p>We thank the reviewer for highlighting the lack in clarity that the scope of this paper was not intended to cover the detection of endogenous PACAP release. We therefore expanded our discussion to encompass the intended purpose of detecting artificially infused or applied PAC1 agonists, such as conducting fundamental tests of drug specificity and developing new pharmacological ligands to selectively target PAC1. This includes a more detailed discussion of our in vivo findings and a clearer phrasing that stresses the potential application for applied drugs and not endogenous PACAP (see last paragraph in the discussion).</p><p>We also agree that little is known about endogenous concentrations of PACAP in the brain. However, we have supplemented our discussion with several references estimating lower concentrations of PACAP and other peptides in vivo, suggesting average PACAP levels below the detection threshold of the sensor. Importantly, within certain brain regions and in closer proximity to release sites, significantly higher concentrations might be reached. Additionally, our data indicate that the concentrations observed under our current conditions do not saturate the sensor in vivo.</p><p>We therefore acknowledge the reviewer’s comment on the sensor’s potential limitations under our current experimental conditions. Hence, we expanded our discussion and suggest the use of higher resolution imaging to potentially reveal loci of high PACAP concentrations, which should be validated by future studies (see also our added discussion in paragraph 4).</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p><bold>Reviewer #3 (Public Review):</bold></p><p>Summary:</p><p>The manuscript introduces PAClight1P78A, a novel genetically encoded sensor designed to facilitate the study of class-B1 G protein-coupled receptors (GPCRs), focusing on the human PAC1 receptor. Addressing the significant challenge of investigating these clinically relevant drug targets, the sensor demonstrates a high dynamic range, excellent ligand selectivity, and rapid activation kinetics. It is validated across a variety of experimental contexts including in vitro, ex vivo, and in vivo models in mice and zebrafish, showcasing its utility for high-throughput screening, basic research, and drug development efforts related to GPCR dynamics and pharmacology.</p><p>Strengths:</p><p>The innovative design of PAClight1P78A successfully bridges a crucial gap in GPCR research by enabling realtime monitoring of receptor activation with high specificity and sensitivity. The extensive validation across multiple models emphasizes the sensor's reliability and versatility, promising significant contributions to both the scientific understanding of GPCR mechanisms and the development of novel therapeutics. Furthermore, by providing the research community with detailed methodologies and access to the necessary viral vectors and plasmids, the authors ensure the sensor's broad applicability and ease of adoption for a wide range of studies focused on GPCR biology and drug targeting.</p><p>Weaknesses</p><p>To further strengthen the manuscript and validate the efficacy of PAClight1P78A as a selective PACAP sensor, it is crucial to demonstrate the sensor's ability to detect endogenous PACAP release in vivo under physiological conditions. While the current data from artificial PACAP application in mouse brain slices and microinfusion in behaving mice provide foundational insights into the sensor's functionality, these approaches predominantly simulate conditions with potentially higher concentrations of PACAP than naturally occurring levels.</p></disp-quote><p>We thank the reviewer for their valuable comments and agree that the use of PAClight for detecting endogenous PACAP will be of big interest for the scientific community and should be a goal for future research. Considering the time, equipment and additional animal licenses necessary, we are convinced that these questions would go beyond the scope of the current paper and might rather be addressed in a follow-up publication. We therefore rephrased the discussion and added more details to clarify further the intended purpose of the current study. Additionally, we added a paragraph in the discussion suggesting experiments needed to validate PAClight for putative future in vivo applications.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Although the sensor's specificity for the PAC1 receptor and its primary ligand is a pivotal achievement, exploring its potential application to other GPCRs within the class-B1 family or broader categories could enhance the manuscript's impact, suggesting ways to adapt this technology for a wider array of receptor studies. Additionally, while the sensor's performance is convincingly demonstrated in short-term experiments, insights into its long-term stability and reusability in more prolonged or repeated measures scenarios would be valuable for researchers interested in chronic studies or longitudinal behavioral analyses. Addressing these aspects could broaden the understanding of the sensor's practical utility over extended research timelines.</p></disp-quote><p>We extend our gratitude to the reviewer for diligently assessing our results.</p><p>Indeed, the very high level of sensitivity that we could achieve in PAClight leads us to think that potentially a grafting-based approach, such as the one we’ve recently described for class-A GPCR-based sensors (PMID: 37474807) could also work for the direct generation of multiple class-B1 sensors based on the optimized fluorescent protein module present in PAClight. Unfortunately, considering the amount of work that testing this hypothesis would entail, we are not able to perform these experiments in the context of this revision, and would rather pursue them as a future project. Nevertheless, we have expanded the discussion of the manuscript with a paragraph with these considerations.</p><p>While we lack comprehensive data on the long-term stability of the sensor, our preliminary findings from photometry recordings optimization indicate consistent baseline expression of PAClight and PACLight ctrl over several weeks. Conducting experiments to systematically assess stability would require several months, which is currently impractical due to limitations in tools and licenses for repeated in vivo infusions. Hence, we intend to include these experiments in potential follow-up studies.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Furthermore, the current in vivo experiments involving microinfusion of PACAP near sensor-expressing areas in behaving mice are based on a relatively small sample size (n=2), which might limit the generalizability of the findings. Increasing the number of subjects in these experimental groups would enhance the statistical power of the results and provide a more robust assessment of the sensor's in vivo functionality. Expanding the sample size will not only validate the findings but also address potential variability within the population, thereby reinforcing the conclusions drawn from these crucial experiments.</p></disp-quote><p>We agree with the reviewer that a sample size of N=2 is not sufficient for in vivo recordings. We therefore increased the sample size and now present recordings with 5 PAClight1P78A and 4 PACLight-control mice. Of note, the new data validate our previous findings and conclusions and give a better idea of the variability in vivo that we now discuss in much more detail in the discussion (see paragraph 2).</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p><bold>Recommendations for the Authors:</bold></p><p><bold>Reviewer #1 (Recommendations For The Authors):</bold></p><p>The lower potency of maxadilan activation might reflect broader implications for ligand-receptor dynamics. Perhaps the authors could discuss the maxadilan binding from a structural perspective, including AlphaFold models. Also, discussing how these findings might influence sensor application in diverse biological contexts would be insightful. Clear definitions and consistent use of these terms are crucial for ensuring that readers understand the methods and results.</p></disp-quote><p>We would like to thank the reviewer for the comments. As part of this work, we did not obtain a dose-response curve for maxadilan peptide, and only reported the maximal response of the sensor to a high concentration of the peptide (10 µM). Thus, our findings would rather inform us on the maximal efficacy of the peptide, as opposed to its potency towards the PAC1R. Furthermore, we would like to point out that due to the lack of structural details for any GPCR-based sensor published to date, we cannot make any molecularly accurate conclusion regarding the precise reasons why a different ligand (in this case the sandfly maxadilan) induces a lower maximal efficacy of the response compared to the endogenous cognate ligand of the receptor. We do not believe that AlphaFold models can accurately replace structural information in this regard, especially given the consideration that the aminoacid linker regions between the GPCR and the fluorescent protein, which are a critical determinant of allosteric chromophore modulation by ligand-induced conformational changes, typically obtain the lowest confidence score in all AlphaFold predicted structural models of GPCR-based sensors. Finally, we would like to refer the reviewer to a very nice recent publication (PMID: 32047270) which resolved the structures of each of these peptides bound to the PAC1 receptor-Gs protein complex, which provides accurate molecular details on the different modalities of receptor binding and activation by PACAP138 versus maxadilan.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p><bold>Reviewer #2 (Recommendations For The Authors):</bold></p><p>The authors are congratulated on the meticulous achievement of their aim, i.e. a fluorescence-based sensor for the detection of PACAP with in vivo utility. Whether or not this sensor will have the requisite sensitivity to detect the release of endogenous PACAP within various regions of the nervous system, in response to specific environmental stimuli or changes in brain or physiological state, remains to be determined.</p></disp-quote><p>We thank the reviewer for the very positive evaluation of our manuscript and for the suggested additions that will improve the strength of our arguments.</p><p>We agree that the in vivo detection of endogenous PACAP will be an important objective for future studies. Due to time, resource and animal license constraints, we are not able to address this objective in our current study, but we now detail possible future experiments in the discussion section. Please see also our answer to the suggested discussion points previously.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p><bold>Reviewer #3 (Recommendations For The Authors):</bold></p><p>To comprehensively assess the sensor's sensitivity and specificity to endogenous PACAP, I recommend conducting additional in vivo experiments where PAClight1P78A is expressed in neurons that endogenously express the Pac1r receptor (using Adcyap1r1-Cre mouse line). These experiments should involve applying sensory or emotional stimuli known to evoke PACAP release or activating upstream PACAP-expressing neurons. Such studies would offer valuable data on the sensor's performance under natural physiological conditions and its potential utility for exploring PACAP's roles in vivo.</p></disp-quote><p>We express our gratitude to the reviewer for providing detailed methodological approaches to examine endogenous PACAP release. These suggestions will prove invaluable for future investigations and are important additions to a follow-up publication. As mentioned earlier, we have incorporated some of these approaches into our discussion. Additionally, we have underscored the existing limitations in detecting endogenous PACAP in vivo and emphasized the relevance of PAClight for drug development purposes.</p></body></sub-article></article>
