DNA and proteins. Here, we report that the RecA recombinase is itself oxidized by ROS. Genetic and biochemical analyses revealed that oxidation of RecA altered its DNA repair and DNA recombination activities. Mass spectrometry analysis showed that exposure to ROS converted four out of nine Met residues of RecA to methionine sulfoxide. Mimicking oxidation of Met35 by changing it for Gln caused complete loss of function, whereas mimicking oxidation of Met164 resulted in constitutive SOS activation and loss of recombination activity. Yet, all ROS-induced alterations of RecA activity were suppressed by methionine sulfoxide reductases MsrA and MsrB. These findings indicate that under oxidative stress MsrA/B is needed for RecA homeostasis control. The implication is that, besides damaging DNA structure directly, ROS prevent repair of DNA damage by hampering RecA activity.</p></abstract><kwd-group kwd-group-type="author-keywords"><kwd>oxidative damage</kwd><kwd>methionine sulfoxide</kwd><kwd>RecA</kwd><kwd>redox</kwd></kwd-group><kwd-group kwd-group-type="research-organism"><title>Research organism</title><kwd><italic>E. coli</italic></kwd></kwd-group><funding-group><award-group id="fund1"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100001665</institution-id><institution>Agence Nationale de la Recherche</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>ANR-METOXIC</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Ezraty</surname><given-names>Benjamin</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund2"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100004794</institution-id><institution>Centre National de la Recherche Scientifique</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>PICS-PROTOX</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Ezraty</surname><given-names>Benjamin</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund3"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100001665</institution-id><institution>Agence Nationale de la Recherche</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>ANR-10-LABX-62-IBEID</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Barras</surname><given-names>Frédéric</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund4"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100002915</institution-id><institution>Fondation pour la Recherche Médicale</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>FRM - FDT20150532554</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Henry</surname><given-names>Camille</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund5"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100007586</institution-id><institution>Aix-Marseille Université</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>AMidex</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Henry</surname><given-names>Camille</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund6"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000057</institution-id><institution>National Institute of General Medical Sciences</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>GM32335</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Cox</surname><given-names>Michael M</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><funding-statement>The funders had no role in study design, data collection and interpretation, or the decision to submit the work for publication.</funding-statement></funding-group><custom-meta-group><custom-meta specific-use="meta-only"><meta-name>Author impact statement</meta-name><meta-value>RecA is inactivated by oxidative stress and repaired by the MsrA/B anti-ROS defense system.</meta-value></custom-meta></custom-meta-group></article-meta></front><body><sec id="s1" sec-type="intro"><title>Introduction</title><p>Aerobic metabolism produces reactive oxygen species (ROS) such as superoxide (O<sub>2</sub>°<sup>-</sup>), hydroxyl radicals (HO°), and the non-radical molecule hydrogen peroxide (H<sub>2</sub>O<sub>2</sub>). Besides the endogenous production, ROS arises from various external sources such as metal, UV radiation, or pathogen defenses (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Imlay, 2019</xref>). ROS are extremely harmful for the cell, leading to nucleic acid damages, protein oxidation, and lipid peroxidation. Exposure to ROS creates enough damage to impair cellular homeostasis in all living systems (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Imlay, 2015</xref>). Within proteins, sulfur-containing cysteinyl and methionyl residues can be oxidized to sulfenic acid adducts and methionine sulfoxide, respectively (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Ezraty et al., 2017</xref>). These post-translational oxidations can be reversed by dedicated protein repair pathways present in all domains of life. Thioredoxin/glutaredoxin reductases can reduce oxidized cysteinyl while methionine sulfoxide reductase (Msr) reduces methionine sulfoxide residues (Met-O).</p><p>In prokaryotes, MsrA and MsrB are mostly present in the cytoplasm (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Ezraty et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Dos et al., 2018</xref>). MsrA and MsrB have a strict stereospecificity for their substrates, with MsrA reducing only Met-<italic>S</italic>-SO and MsrB reducing only Met-<italic>R</italic>-SO diastereoisomers. Consequently, full repair of a given cytosolic oxidized protein requires the action of both MsrA and MsrB (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib46">Tsvetkov et al., 2005</xref>). Lack of functional MsrA/B yielded to pleiotropic phenotypes related to bacterial virulence or aging. Global proteomic or dedicated studies identified substrates, like the ubiquitous protein SRP54 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Ezraty et al., 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Gennaris et al., 2015</xref>) and several other proteins listed in the database MetOSite (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://metosite.uma.es">https://metosite.uma.es</ext-link>) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib47">Valverde et al., 2019</xref>). However, a molecular understanding of the contribution of Msr as an anti-ROS defense needs the actual identification of proteins, whose activities are hampered by oxidation and can be rescued by Msr’s repairing activity.</p><p>In this study, we identified the ubiquitous recombinase RecA as a substrate of MsrA/B. RecA promotes DNA recombination and coordinates stress response by inducing the expression of the SOS regulatory system. We report that RecA is targeted by ROS and this abrogates both RecA recombination and SOS induction capacities. We show that MsrA/B are able to rescue oxidized RecA activities. Furthermore, an in-depth analysis allowed us to show that Met residues are not all oxidized at the same rate, and that functional consequences of oxidation depend upon which Met residue is being hit. Overall we discuss a model that predicts how under oxidative stress both protein repair and <italic>de novo</italic> synthesis are used by <italic>Escherichia coli</italic> to replenish the pool of functional RecA above a threshold value.</p></sec><sec id="s2" sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><sec id="s2-1"><title>MsrA/B are required for RecA-dependent viability under stress conditions</title><p>An <italic>E. coli</italic> strain derivative lacking all peroxide-scavenging activities (catalases KatE and KatG, and peroxidase AhpC), referred to as Hpx<sup>-</sup>, accumulates micromolar amounts of H<sub>2</sub>O<sub>2</sub> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib43">Seaver and Imlay, 2001</xref>). We found the Hpx<sup>-</sup> <italic>msrA msrB</italic> strain to have significantly reduced viability upon UV stress compared to the Hpx<sup>-</sup> parental strain with around 1.4 log difference at 50 and 60 J/m<sup>2</sup> (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1A</xref>). UV defect is a hallmark of DNA recombination and/or repair defect. <italic>E. coli</italic> fights UV-induced DNA damages by both a RecA-dependent homologous recombination (HR) pathway and a RecA-independent UvrABCD-dependent nucleotide excision repair (NER) pathway. Therefore, we deleted either the <italic>recA</italic> or the <italic>uvrA</italic> gene in the Hpx<sup>-</sup> background. In fact, the <italic>recA</italic> mutation proved to be lethal in the Hpx<sup>-</sup> background in aerobic conditions as previously reported (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">Park et al., 2005</xref>). In contrast, the Hpx<sup>-</sup> <italic>uvrA</italic> strain exhibited no phenotype, presumably because the HR pathway was sufficient to afford UV resistance. We then used Hpx<sup>-</sup> <italic>uvrA</italic> strain to delete both <italic>msrA</italic> and <italic>msrB</italic> genes. The resulting Hpx<sup>-</sup> <italic>msrA msrB uvrA</italic> strain showed hypersensitivity to O<sub>2</sub>, similar to the Hpx<sup>-</sup> <italic>recA</italic> strain (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1B</xref>). Altogether, these observations suggested that in the presence of a higher-than-normal level of H<sub>2</sub>O<sub>2</sub> RecA protein might be damaged by oxidation. MsrA/B thus could be essential for maintaining a level of functional reduced RecA above a threshold value. Consistently, we observed that high <italic>recA</italic> gene dosage suppressed UV sensitivity of the Hpx <italic>msrA msrB</italic> mutant (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1C</xref>) and the O<sub>2</sub> sensitivity of the Hpx<sup>-</sup> <italic>msrA msrB uvrA</italic> (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1D</xref>).</p><fig id="fig1" position="float"><label>Figure 1.</label><caption><title>MsrA/B essential for maintaining RecA functional.</title><p>(<bold>A</bold>) UV sensitivity of wild-type (WT) and mutant strains (BE152 [<italic>ΔmsrA ΔmsrB</italic>]; BE007 [Hpx<sup>-</sup>]; BE080 [Hpx<sup>-</sup><italic>ΔmsrA ΔmsrB</italic>]) was tested by monitoring colony-forming units at different UV doses.

We used P1 phage-mediated transduction (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">Miller, 1972</xref>) to assess RecA-dependent HR efficiency under oxidative stress. When using the Hpx<sup>-</sup> <italic>msrA msrB</italic> strain as a recipient, the transductant frequency dropped tenfold compared with the parental MsrA/B-proficient strain (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2A</xref>). Transductant frequency was restored to the parental strain level by bringing in either plasmid-borne <italic>msrA</italic> or <italic>msrB</italic> genes (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2A</xref>). Next, we investigated the influence of MsrA/B on the RecA-dependent SOS response. We used a <italic>recA-gfp</italic> gene fusion to monitor the SOS response. The Hpx<sup>-</sup> strain exhibited enhanced SOS induction compared with the wild-type (WT) strain (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2B</xref>). This was consistent with a previous work reporting increased DNA damage level in the Hpx<sup>-</sup> background (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Courcelle et al., 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">Mancini and Imlay, 2015</xref>). When <italic>msrA msrB</italic> deletions were introduced into the Hpx<sup>-</sup> background, the level of SOS induction decreased and was similar to that observed in the WT strain (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2B</xref>).

The Hpx<sup>-</sup> strain exhibited an enhanced level of <italic>recA-gfp</italic> expression compared with the WT (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2B</xref>). In contrast, deleting <italic>msrA msrB</italic> genes in the Hpx<sup>-</sup> strain impaired MMC induction of <italic>recA-gfp</italic> (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2B</xref>). Altogether, these observations showed that under oxidative stress MsrA/B maintains a level of reduced functional RecA necessary to carry out both efficient recombination and SOS regulation.</p><fig id="fig2" position="float"><label>Figure 2.</label><caption><title>Physiological importance of RecA repair by MsrA and MsrB.</title><p>(<bold>A</bold>) Transductant frequency of a <italic>lacZ-cat</italic> marker in different genetics backgrounds.

First, purified RecA protein was treated with hydrogen peroxide (H<sub>2</sub>O<sub>2</sub>) (50 mM) for 2 hr and analyzed by mass spectrometry. On the nine Met residues present in RecA, four could be identified within peptides detectable by mass spectrometry after peptidase digestion. In contrast, peptides containing Met28 and Met197 were too small to be detected. Likewise, Met35, Met58, Met164, and Met202 were found to have around 20% of oxidation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3A</xref>). This basal level of oxidation could be explained by the use of in-gel digestion, a technique known to cause Met oxidation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Klont et al., 2018</xref>), prior to mass spectrometry analysis. After H<sub>2</sub>O<sub>2</sub> treatment, the level of oxidation increased to approximately 90% at Met164- and Met202-containing positions (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3A</xref>). Met35 and Met58, being part of the same peptide, we were unable to differentiate the oxidation level of each residue separately. Importantly, no Cys residue was found to be modified. Second, the RecA oxidized above, referred to as RecAox, was treated with MsrA/B enzymes in the presence of 1,4-dithiothreitol (DTT) to yield to RecArep. Mass spectrometry analysis of RecArep revealed a drastic decrease in its content of Met-O residues (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3A</xref>). As explained above, gel electrophoresis per se might have induced oxidation of Met residues, and therefore, one must be cautious when considering the quantitation of Met-O as their source might be multiple. However, besides allowing us to identify those Met residues that are sensitive to oxidation and eventually can be reduced by the MsrA/B enzymes, these <italic>in vitro</italic> characterizations allowed us to guide our <italic>in vivo</italic> studies presented later in this article. Third, we used a gel shift assay that detects Met-O residues in a polypeptide as Met-O-containing polypeptides run slower than their reduced counterpart on SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis (SDS-PAGE) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Gennaris et al., 2015</xref>). By western blot, we observed that RecA produced in a <italic>msrA msrB</italic> mutant exposed to HOCl treatment run slower than RecA produced in a WT strain or in a <italic>msrA msrB</italic> mutant that has not been exposed to HOCl (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3B</xref>). These results showed that RecA is subject to oxidation both <italic>in vitro</italic> and <italic>in vivo</italic>, and that in both contexts MsrA/B allows reduction of Met-O residues present in RecAox.</p><fig-group><fig id="fig3" position="float"><label>Figure 3.</label><caption><title>Reversible inactivation of RecA by MsrA and MsrB.</title><p>(<bold>A</bold>) RecA was treated with H<sub>2</sub>O<sub>2</sub> to induce Met-O formation.

The same is very much likely to hold in more complex organisms such as humans as RecA is highly conserved and consequences of human RecA oxidation in DNA damage-associated pathologies are to be expected as well.</p><p>In this study, we collected multiple evidences showing that RecA is targeted by ROS and that MsrA/B maintains a level of reduced functional RecA necessary to carry out both efficient recombination and SOS regulation. Importantly, we cannot rule out the possibility that other recombination/DNA repair-associated proteins, like RecBCD and LexA of <italic>E. coli,</italic> could be also targeted by ROS. As a matter of fact, a few previous studies had pointed out a link between oxidative stress and activity of proteins involved in genome integrity.

RPA protein pondered its potential consequences for skin cancer risk due to a defect in nucleotide excision repair (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Guven et al., 2015</xref>). However, in all the cases cited above, oxidation was irreversible. In contrast, here we show that oxidation of RecA can be reversed by the action of methionine sulfoxide reductases MsrA/B. This provides a very different view of oxidation as reversibility afforded by MsrA/B opens the possibility to exploit redox changes to regulate RecA protein activities. A similar situation arises with HypT, a transcriptional regulator relying on Met residues to sense HOCl-mediated oxidation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Drazic et al., 2013</xref>). Conceptually, the same reversibility phenomenon arises with Cys positions whose oxido-reduction can be controlled by thioredoxin/glutaredoxin systems. Altogether, these different cases recall that oxidation is not only a damaging event but also a signal the cells can exploit to set up adaptative responses.</p><p>Genetic and biochemical analyses as well as use of Gln as a proxy for Met oxidation led us to observe a variety of functional consequences of oxidation on RecA activity. Exposure of RecA to H<sub>2</sub>O<sub>2</sub> or HOCl led to oxidation of Met35, 58, 164, and 202, and loss of all biochemical activities. Moreover, dose–response analysis revealed that Met residues responded with a different sensitivity to ROS as some Met residues did not undergo oxidation while others did. This illustrated how oxidation of a protein covers a complex and heterogenous situation. Hence, the present study demonstrates that in order to appreciate and predict the effects of Met oxidation of a given protein activity, the following information will be needed: (i) functional consequences of oxidation of each Met, (ii) proportion of Met-O-containing polypeptides within the whole oxidized population, (iii) efficiency of Msr repair acting at each Met position, and (iv) threshold value of activity of the targeted protein for a WT phenotype be maintained.</p><p>Oxidation of two Met residues, Met35 and Met164, and its associated functional consequences was particularly studied. Mimicking oxidation of Met35 alone also led to total loss of function. This endows Met35 with a key role in RecA activity, somehow at odds with the fact that it is not conserved throughout the RecA/Rad51 family (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="app1fig1">Appendix 1—figure 1</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">Lusetti and Cox, 2002</xref>). Oxidation of Met164 led to loss of recombination capacity as indicated by sensitivity to MMC treatment, decreased fitness, and an incapacity to promote DNA strand exchange <italic>in vitro</italic>. Also, Met164 oxidation caused constitutive activation of SOS response <italic>in vivo</italic>. However, growth characteristic revealed that this was of no advantage for <italic>E. coli,</italic> and reciprocally, a mutation that prevented oxidation at that position provided a better fitness over the WT. Interestingly, Met164 is conserved in the human and <italic>Saccharomyces cerevisiae</italic> Rad51 proteins (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="app1fig1">Appendix 1—figure 1</xref>). Hence, the overall picture that emerged is that oxidation of RecA per se is deleterious for the cell and the MsrA/B repair system helps to mitigate this effect.</p><p>Analysis of oxidation of Met35 and Met164 and of its functional consequences provides us with a model on the pathway followed by RecA during oxidation and how cell can replenish the intracellular pool of functional RecA under oxidative stress (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig9">Figure 9</xref>). One mode is to exploit the MsrA/B system to repair existing and oxidized RecA. This is the situation that will prevail when MsrA/B acts at the Met35 position. Another mode is to start off synthesis of fresh RecA protein by activation of the SOS regulon, which includes the <italic>recA</italic> gene. This is the possibility afforded by the oxidation of Met164 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig9">Figure 9</xref>). A mechanistic question still remaining is how oxidation of Met164 facilitates SOS activation in the absence of free 3′ DNA ends. Our observation that RecA<sup>M164Q</sup> does not seem to require the help of SSB for nucleofilament formation and ATP hydrolysis opens the possibility that, like RecA730 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">Long et al., 2008</xref>), the RecA<sup>M164Q</sup> variant might be activated by single-stranded DNA produced upon replication. Another possibility is that homologous recombination deficiency of the RecA<sup>M164Q</sup> variant activates constitutively the SOS because of accumulation of DNA damages.</p><fig id="fig9" position="float"><label>Figure 9.</label><caption><title>A model of homeostasis control of RecA under oxidative stress.</title><p>RecA structural model is shown with the two Met residues (Met35 and Met164) analyzed in the present work. The RecA partially oxidized form contains a Met164-oxidized residue while the RecA-oxidized inactive form contains both Met35- and Met164-oxidized residues. The MsrA/B repair pathway allows to maintain the pool of functional RecA by repair, and the SOS induction pathway allows to replenish the pool of functional RecA by <italic>de novo</italic> synthesis.</p></caption><graphic mime-subtype="tiff" mimetype="image" xlink:href="elife-63747-fig9-v3.tif"/></fig><p>To conclude, this study identified RecA as a target of oxidative stress. RecA-associated recombination/repair and SOS-inducing properties are potentially canceled following exposure to oxidative stress and cells make use of MsrA/B as a protecting/repairing system, which suppresses most oxidative-mediated defects. Thus, RecA stands as a new bona fide substrate of the MsrA/B anti-ROS defense system.</p></sec><sec id="s4" sec-type="materials|methods"><title>Materials and methods</title><table-wrap

Peptides were dissolved in solvent A (0.1% TFA in 2% ACN), directly loaded onto reversed-phase pre-column (Acclaim PepMap 100, Thermo Scientific), and eluted in backflush mode. Peptide separation was performed using a reversed-phase analytical column (Acclaim PepMap RSLC, 0.075 × 250 mm, Thermo Scientific) with a linear gradient of 4–36% solvent B (0.1% FA in 98% ACN) for 36 min, 40–99% solvent B for 10 min, and holding at 99% for the last 5 min at a constant flow rate of 300 nL/min on an EASY-nLC 1000 UPLC system.

The peptides were subjected to NSI source followed by tandem mass spectrometry (MS/MS) in Fusion Lumos coupled online to the UPLC. Intact peptides were detected in the Orbitrap at a resolution of 120,000. Peptides were selected for MS/MS using HCD setting at 30; ion fragments were detected in the Orbitrap at a resolution of 30,000.

ATP (3 mM) with or without 2 µM SSB protein was added, and the reaction was incubated for an additional 10 min after which ATPγS was added to 3 mM to stabilize the filaments and further incubated for an additional 3 min. In EM experiments involving linear dsDNA (lds), the experiment procedures were done without SSB proteins. In order to make sure that the filaments observed were not formed by RecA joining on its own, the control experiment was done without DNA, and no RecA filament was observed (data not shown).</p><p>The reaction mixture was diluted to a final DNA concentration of 0.4 ng/µL in 10 mM HEPES, 200 mM ammonium acetate, 10% glycerol (pH adjusted to 7.5), and adsorbed on alcian grid for 3 min. The grid was then touched to a drop of the above buffer followed by floating on a drop of the same buffer for 1 min. The sample was then stained by touching to a drop of 5% uranyl acetate followed by floating on a fresh drop of the same solution for 30 s. Finally, the grid was washed by touching to a drop of double-distilled water followed by immersion in two 10-mL beakers of double-distilled water. After the sample was dried, it was rotary-shadowed with platinum. This protocol is designed for visualization of complete reaction mixtures, and no attempt was made to remove unreacted material. Although this approach should yield results that give a true insight into reaction components, it does lead to samples with a high background of unreacted proteins.

Your article has been reviewed by three peer reviewers, and the evaluation has been overseen by a Reviewing Editor and a Senior Editor. The reviewers have opted to remain anonymous.</p><p>Our decision has been reached after consultation between the reviewers. Based on these discussions and the individual reviews below, we regret to inform you that your work will not be considered further for publication in <italic>eLife</italic>.</p><p>This is an interesting paper but it has some holes, especially regarding the <italic>in vivo</italic> significance.

Two new experiments were carried out that relate to these questions and modified our view and conclusion.</p><p>First, we performed a mass-spec analysis of RecA subjected to increasing concentration of HOCl in order to have a dose/response sensitivity of Met residues to oxidation. We observed that M164 is more prone to oxidation than Met35. This result is now included in the new modified version (Figure 7D). Clearly this “enhanced” sensitivity to M164 is consistent with the hypothesis we developed in the previous version, according to which some molecules of RecA could be oxidized solely on Met164 and fires on the SOS response to permit a anticipatory strategy. Second, we did experiments aimed at assessing the physiological advantage that the presence of an oxidizable Met at position 164 could provide. A strain producing RecA-M164Q which mimics a RecA molecule locked in a oxidized state at position 164 showed a very slow growth and filamentous phenotype. Moreover, we run a competition assay between the wild type and the strain synthesizing the RecA-M164L protein. Surprisingly, the RecA-M164L synthesizing strain showed enhanced fitness and this enhanced fitness was dependent upon aerobic conditions.</p><p>Thus these new results do show that Met residues exhibit diverse sensitivity towards oxidation and M164 is the most sensitive, as we speculated it could be in our first version. However, growth experiments showed that, M164 oxidation is deleterious for bacterial fitness. All of the data of the fitness experiments are presented in the text and Figure 6. Therefore, we do no longer present the speculative view of an anticipatory effect of oxidation at position 164 and rather conclude that ROS can inactivate RecA, the level of which can be replenished by <italic>E. coli</italic> in multiple ways as depicted in Figure 8.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Reviewer #2:</p><p>The paper describes experiments that attempt to correlate the oxidation of specific Met residues in the RecA protein with its in vivo functions in SOS induction, DNA repair and recombination and its activities to bind ssDNA, ATPase activity and in vitro recombination.

However, the only way to get this piece of information (i.e. that Met residues are oxidized in vivo) would be by using mass spectrometry analysis and this proved to be non-reliable (see answer to reviewer 3 below). The only answer we can give is that we obtained additional confidence in the oxidation of RecA in vivo by applying gel shift approach. This approach is based on the fact that proteins oxidized on their Met residues show a slower migration profile than the reduced one. This was used in several previous studies in the field including in our previous work on MsrP (Gennaris et al., 2015). These data are crucial to our study and they have now been included in the modified new version (Figure 3B). Also we were able to show that indeed in vivo after an HOCl stress, RecA is more oxidized in a <italic>msrAB</italic> mutant as compared to the wt. The fact that the absence of MsrAB does show a consequence on RecA migration does support the notion that Met residues were oxidized in the first place. And we might remind that in vitro even we used non-physiological large amounts of H2O2, we had no evidences for oxidation of residues other than Met. Taken together, it seems to us that these series of converging data do indicate that RecA Met residues are oxidized upon exposure to oxidative stress.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>2) The phenotypes that the authors show deficiency in recombination, cell growth etc under the oxidized conditions could be due to the oxidation of many different proteins.

We attempted to test whether overproduction of some of them such as RecR or UvrB, could act as multicopy suppressors. This would have been an indication ROS would have reduce their functional concentration. Unfortunately, overexpression of RecR and UvrB turned out to be toxic for Hpx <italic>E. coli</italic> and we could not get reliable data. Thus, although we cannot rule out the possibility that multiple proteins might be damaged and as a whole contribute to the observed phenotype, we feel we provide sufficient evidence, both genetic and biochemical, to support the idea that at least RecA is one of them and that its oxidation contributes significantly to the UV sensitivity of the Hpx <italic>msrAB uvr</italic>A strain. However, we thank the reviewer for pointing out the possibility of other hits and we introduced a sentence explicating this fact.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>3) Another concern with the in vivo results is the &quot;complementation&quot; data with the RecA mutants on plasmids.

Indeed, in vivo the M164L encoding strain exhibits wild-type like MMC resistance and SOS induction levels but we didn’t perform any biochemical characterization of this variant. The supplementary results (Figure 5) shows biochemical characterization of the M35L variant, which is affected in all activities and in vivo lead to an inactive RecA (MMC sensitive and non-inducible SOS) (Figure 4). We hope the changes introduced (Figure 4 C, D, E, F and Figure 5) clarified this point.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>5) In the MsrAB rescue in vitro experiments, why does the RecA ATPase not come back to full activity?

None of the RecA activities are full restored (ATPase, nucleoprotein filaments formation and strand exchange) following MsrAB repair. Mass-spec analysis revealed no other modification (i.e. Cys modification, R-K-P-T carbonylation ). One possibility is that full recovery requires a chaperon.

We have now completed the oxidation experiments by submitting RecA to µM concentration of HOCl as Met residues are known to be highly sensitivity to HOCl.</p><p>We set up different protocols of purification of RecA (aerobic or anaerobic) and produce it in different strains (wt, msrAB, Hpx, Hpx msrAB) which were exposed or not to HOCl. Eventually mass spec analysis was carried out to characterize oxidation state of the resulting purified and treated RecA samples mass-spec analysis. Unfortunately, and as anticipated by this reviewers 3, results from several different experiments lack reproducibility. In particular we noticed that the level of spontaneous oxidation, even in sample prepared anaerobically, was very high (approx. 20%) and also we noticed that depending upon the background used, RecA formed high aggregates. Although these aggregates could be sign of misfolding due to various level of oxidation, this essentially introduced great variability in the purification protocol, which eventually could have misled us. Therefore, we are sorry and very frustrated about this given the amount of efforts we put in this approach, but we cannot but give up use of mass spec analysis to characterize the oxidation status of RecA in vivo.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>It is surprising that paper talking about oxidative damage has not employed a single acute oxidative treatment (like superoxide, or hydrogen peroxide or, perhaps the most relevant for protein oxidation, hypochlorous acid).</p></disp-quote><p>We thank the reviewer for this excellent idea and we followed his suggestion.

It would require three predictions. (i) LexA is oxidized on its Met residues, which is entirely possible, (ii) oxidation of LexA made it more resistant to RecA mediated cleavage and (iii) overexpression of RecA would overcome the intrinsic resistance of oxidized LexA. All of these situations are indeed possible, yet they seem to require much more speculative assumptions than the more economic scenario we propose here. In fact LexA was indeed pointed out as a target of ROS in the literature. However, the outcome was opposite to what is predicted in the model above as oxidized LexA was no longer able to repress SOS system, resulting in full expression of SOS (Schook et al., 2011). This is cited in our version. Furthermore we have never been able to observe a difference on LexA motility by using gel-shift assay with antiLexA antibodies. Yet, in agreement with reviewer 2 comment #2, we made explicit the fact that we cannot exclude that other DNA repair/recombination proteins were also hit by oxidative stress.</p><p>[Editors’ note: what follows is the authors’ response to the second round of review.]</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Revisions:</p><p>This manuscript should be accepted, but needs an important major revision.

We wish to make clear however that all the samples (native RecA, RecAox and RecArep) have been run and digested at the same time and in the same way. So the difference in MetO content observed between the different forms is likely to reflect intrinsic features of each of them.

Therefore, we underlined it in the new version of the manuscript wherein the possibility of artefact Met oxidation during in-gel digestion is made explicit along with the reference to the Klont et al., 2018 paper. As suggested, we warn the reader of these potential pitfalls, yet we explain how these in vitro results were helpful in guiding us for in vivo studies and helping us to choose which Met residues should be further studied, i.e.</p><p>M35 and M164.</p><p>These modifications have now been included in the modified new version.</p><p>Moreover, as suggested by reviewer #2, we refer to the Metosite database, which provides data of sulfoxidation sites in proteins.</p></body></sub-article></article>
