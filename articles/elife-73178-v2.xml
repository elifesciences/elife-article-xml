Peptidoglycan is dynamic and requires regulated synthesis of new material, remodeling, and turnover – or autolysis – of old material. Despite exploitation of peptidoglycan synthesis as an antibiotic target, we lack a fundamental understanding of how peptidoglycan synthesis and autolysis intersect to maintain the cell wall. Here, we uncover a critical physiological role for a widely misunderstood class of autolytic enzymes, lytic transglycosylases (LTGs). We demonstrate that LTG activity is essential to survival by contributing to periplasmic processes upstream and independent of peptidoglycan recycling. Defects accumulate in <italic>Vibrio cholerae</italic> LTG mutants due to generally inadequate LTG activity, rather than absence of specific enzymes, and essential LTG activities are likely independent of protein-protein interactions, as heterologous expression of a non-native LTG rescues growth of a conditional LTG-null mutant. Lastly, we demonstrate that soluble, uncrosslinked, endopeptidase-dependent peptidoglycan chains, also detected in the wild-type, are enriched in LTG mutants, and that LTG mutants are hypersusceptible to the production of diverse periplasmic polymers. Collectively, our results suggest that LTGs prevent toxic crowding of the periplasm with synthesis-derived peptidoglycan polymers and, contrary to prevailing models, that this autolytic function can be temporally separate from peptidoglycan synthesis.</p></abstract><kwd-group kwd-group-type="author-keywords"><kwd>peptidoglycan</kwd><kwd>lytic transglycosylase</kwd><kwd><italic>Vibrio cholerae</italic></kwd><kwd>periplasm</kwd></kwd-group><kwd-group kwd-group-type="research-organism"><title>Research organism</title><kwd>Other</kwd></kwd-group><funding-group><award-group id="fund1"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000002</institution-id><institution>National Institutes of Health</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>R01-GM130971</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Dörr</surname><given-names>Tobias</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund2"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution>Molecular Infection Medicine Sweden</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>MIMS2012</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Cava</surname><given-names>Felipe</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund3"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100004063</institution-id><institution>Knut och Alice Wallenbergs Stiftelse</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>KAW2012.0184</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Cava</surname><given-names>Felipe</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund4"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution>Swedish Research Council</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>VR2018-02823</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Cava</surname><given-names>Felipe</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund5"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100016756</institution-id><institution>Kempe Foundation</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>SMK2062</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Cava</surname><given-names>Felipe</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund6"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000002</institution-id><institution>National Institutes of Health</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>R01-GM113172</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>van Nieuwenhze</surname><given-names>Michael S</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund7"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000002</institution-id><institution>National Institutes of Health</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>R35-GM136365</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>van Nieuwenhze</surname><given-names>Michael S</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><funding-statement>The funders had no role in study design, data collection and interpretation, or the decision to submit the work for publication.</funding-statement></funding-group><custom-meta-group><custom-meta specific-use="meta-only"><meta-name>Author impact statement</meta-name><meta-value>A critical role for bacterial lytic transglycosylases in the clearance of novel, toxic cell wall turnover products that accumulate during vegetative growth is identified through genetic approaches and compositional analysis of solubilized peptidoglycan released from the bacterial cell wall.</meta-value></custom-meta></custom-meta-group></article-meta></front><body><sec id="s1" sec-type="intro"><title>Introduction</title><p>The bacterial cell wall is a nearly universal feature of the bacterial cell envelope. Made primarily of the strong and elastic polymer peptidoglycan (PG), the cell wall preserves bacterial shape while protecting the cell from its high internal turgor pressure and external environmental challenges (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib46">Osawa and Erickson, 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Cabeen and Jacobs-Wagner, 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Egan et al., 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib70">Zhao et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib54">Sochacki et al., 2011</xref>). PG synthesis begins in the cytoplasm with the generation of lipid II, consisting of a disaccharide (N-acetylmuramic acid [MurNAc]-N-acetylglucosamine [GlcNAc]) that is modified with a pentapeptide side stem and attached to the lipid carrier undecaprenol. Lipid II is flipped across the cytoplasmic membrane where the cell wall is assembled in two reactions: first, lipid II is polymerized into longer glycan strands by glycosyltransferases (GTases) followed by crosslinking of the elongating PG strands via their peptide side stems by transpeptidases (TPases) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Egan et al., 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib70">Zhao et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Cho et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">Leclercq et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib57">Taguchi et al., 2019</xref>). Ultimately, the combined result of GTase and TPase activities is a covalently closed mesh-like macromolecular network called the PG sacculus.</p><p>The strength of the PG sacculus is a double-edged sword. On the one hand, the covalent network provides a mechanical structure strong enough to withstand the high cellular turgor pressure and stresses of a changing environment. On the other hand, it acts as a macromolecular cage that might inhibit cellular expansion and division as well as the insertion of crucial trans-envelope machinery (i.e., flagella and pili) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib44">Nambu et al., 1999</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib50">Santin and Cascales, 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Höltje, 1998</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Atassi, 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib63">Viollier and Shapiro, 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib61">Uehara and Park, 2008</xref>). Bacteria therefore need to couple new PG synthesis with degradation of bonds within the PG network to simultaneously maintain the integrity of the sacculus while also making space for the insertion of new PG (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Höltje, 1998</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib45">Nguyen et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">Lee and Huang, 2013</xref>).</p><p>PG degradation is accomplished by several divergent enzyme classes that are often subsumed under the term ‘autolysins,’ that is, enzymes that cleave various bonds within PG. Endopeptidases (EPs), for example, cleave the peptide crosslinks and are particularly integral to the ‘space-making’ autolytic function that permits sacculus expansion during cell elongation; without EP activity, PG synthesis results in a thicker cell wall or integrity failure and lysis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib43">Murphy et al., 2021</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib53">Singh et al., 2012</xref>). Another major class of autolysins, the lytic transglycosylases (LTGs), cleave the glycosidic linkages between disaccharide subunits within PG strands. Their biochemistry has been exquisitely well-studied and the diversity of their structures and mechanisms of action well-characterized (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Byun et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Dik et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">Lee et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib62">Vijayaraghavan et al., 2018</xref>). Unlike the other autolysins, the primary cleavage mechanism of LTGs is non-hydrolytic. Rather, LTGs perform an intramolecular cyclization of MurNAc residues to generate a unique and readily identifiable signature of their activity, anhydro-MurNAc (anhMurNAc) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Dik et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Höltje et al., 1975</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib67">Williams et al., 2018</xref>). Early characterization of PG in the bacterial sacculus suggested that every PG strand terminates in an anhMurNAc cap, implicating LTGs as potential ‘terminases’ of GTase glycan elongation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Höltje et al., 1975</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">Kraft et al., 1998</xref>). This was recently confirmed empirically with the novel discovery and characterization of MltG and its functional analogs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Bohrhunter et al., 2021</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib69">Yunck et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib51">Sassine et al., 2021</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib60">Tsui et al., 2016</xref>). <italic>Escherichia coli</italic> MltG associates with active PG synthetic complexes to release new strands from the cytoplasmic membrane (to which they are initially tethered via undecaprenyl pyrophosphate), presumably as they emerge from GTase activity; consequently, MltG is a strong determinant of PG strand length (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Bohrhunter et al., 2021</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib69">Yunck et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib51">Sassine et al., 2021</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib60">Tsui et al., 2016</xref>). Whether association with active GTases is a conserved characteristic of MltG functional analogues (including some hydrolytic glycosidases; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib58">Taguchi et al., 2021</xref>) has not been established, so these enzymes may be more broadly referred to as ‘PG release factors’ since their cleavage of membrane-bound PG may not directly influence PG elongation. Other physiological roles assigned to LTGs include local PG editing for insertion of PG-spanning protein complexes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib50">Santin and Cascales, 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Atassi, 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">Koraimann, 2003</xref>) and PG recycling. PG recycling, the reincorporation of PG breakdown products into the biosynthesis cycle, starts with the uptake of PG turnover products by the importer AmpG (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Jacobs et al., 1994</xref>). AmpG specifically imports LTG breakdown products (anhMurNAc-containing fragments), and this process can theoretically be supported by any active LTG that produces monomeric anhydromuropeptides. Despite being well-conserved across many bacterial phyla (and some chloroplasts), PG recycling is not an essential process under standard growth conditions (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Dik et al., 2018</xref>). Another underappreciated function of LTGs has emerged through the work of our group and others wherein certain individual or combinatorial LTG mutations, including septal LTG RlpA, result in a daughter cell separation defect (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Heidrich et al., 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Jorgenson et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib66">Weaver et al., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib48">Priyadarshini et al., 2006</xref>). Intriguingly, the roles of LTGs in all these functions – PG release from the membrane, PG recycling, insertion of PG-spanning complexes, and daughter cell separation – do not appear to be essential to bacterial growth in the contexts studied to date.</p><p>The apparent nonessentiality of LTG activity would seem contradictory to this enzyme class’s broad conservation, as well as the genetic and functional redundancy within many individual species – a trait indicative of an important, conserved function (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib69">Yunck et al., 2016</xref>). Yet answering the most general physiological questions about LTGs has been severely encumbered by LTG redundancy, as rarely does a single LTG mutation yield a significant, readily investigable phenotype. We recently showed that collectively, LTG activity indeed seems to be essential for growth and division (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib66">Weaver et al., 2019</xref>). The actual physiological function for the majority of LTGs, however, and the reason for their collective essentiality, has remained elusive. Here, we sought to comprehensively illuminate physiological roles for LTGs by extensively characterizing mutants of the Gram-negative pathogen <italic>Vibrio cholerae</italic> that are defective for most or all of the species’ eight currently annotated LTGs. We find that the vast majority of LTGs are dispensable for growth in laboratory media. Minimal LTG strains are defective for growth in low-salt media and hypersensitive to accumulation of periplasmic sugar polymers. Through analysis of PG turnover products, we show that soluble PG strands accumulate in the wild-type and that this is exacerbated in ∆LTG mutants and alleviated by inactivating a major PG EP. Taken together, our data suggest that LTG activity downstream of PG synthesis mitigates toxic periplasmic accumulation of uncrosslinked, polymeric PG turnover products released by EPs.</p></sec><sec id="s2" sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><sec id="s2-1"><title>A single LTG is necessary and sufficient for <italic>V. cholerae</italic> growth</title><p>We recently reported that a ∆6 LTG mutant (<italic>rlpA</italic><sup>+</sup> <italic>mltG</italic><sup>+</sup> ∆<italic>mltA ∆mltB ∆mltC ∆mltD ∆mltF</italic> ∆<italic>slt70</italic>) was viable under standard laboratory conditions and exhibited only slight morphological defects, including an increase in cell length (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib66">Weaver et al., 2019</xref>). Depletion of RlpA from this background resulted in a lethal chaining defect, suggesting that collectively, some degree of LTG activity is essential for <italic>V. cholerae</italic> growth. Since we were previously unable to delete MltG or observe its depletion from a ∆6 LTG background, we asked whether MltG exhibited a synthetic-lethal relationship with the other LTGs using a quantitative insertion/disruption assay. Briefly, we conjugated a suicide vector targeting <italic>mltG</italic> (or positive or negative control loci) into WT and ∆6 LTG and quantified viable recombinants. Surprisingly, the WT and ∆6 LTG strains both tolerated inactivation of <italic>mltG</italic> by the suicide vector so long as essential DNA synthesis genes downstream of <italic>mltG</italic> were expressed in <italic>trans</italic> to ameliorate polar effects of <italic>mltG</italic> disruption (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1A</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1A and B</xref>). The resulting ∆6 LTG <italic>mltG::kan</italic> mutant was viable in LB but failed to grow in low-salt LB (LB without added NaCl, hereafter designated LB0N) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1C</xref>), which could explain why previous attempts to inactivate <italic>mltG</italic> in this background using SacB-based allelic exchange (requiring selection on LB0N + sucrose) were unsuccessful (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib66">Weaver et al., 2019</xref>). Consistent with these data, we were then able to generate a clean, viable ∆7 LTG mutant (<italic>rlpA</italic><sup>+</sup> <italic>mltG::stop</italic> ∆<italic>mltABCDF</italic> ∆<italic>slt70</italic>) using an MqsR toxin-based allelic exchange system (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">Lazarus et al., 2019</xref>).

Additionally, by placing the native copy of <italic>rlpA</italic> under an arabinose-inducible promoter, we were able to conditionally deplete RlpA by growing these strains in the absence of arabinose to observe the effects of LTG insufficiency (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1B</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s2">Figure 1—figure supplement 2</xref>). Compared to ∆6 LTG (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib66">Weaver et al., 2019</xref>), RlpA depletion was more severe in the ∆7 background, both by morphology and plating efficiency, consistent with ∆7 exhibiting more limited LTG activity than ∆6.</p><fig-group><fig id="fig1" position="float"><label>Figure 1.</label><caption><title>A single lytic transglycosylase (LTG) is necessary and sufficient for <italic>V.</italic> <italic>cholerae</italic> growth and envelope homeostasis.</title><p>(<bold>A</bold>) <italic>Trans</italic> expression of DNA synthesis genes <italic>vc2016-2014</italic> permitted pAM299 disruption of native <italic>mltG</italic> locus. <italic>lacZ</italic> and <italic>rpoB</italic> were targeted as positive and negative controls for disruption, respectively.

These observations suggest that LTGs perform at least two separable essential functions for viability, where MltG can perform one function but requires MltA, MltB, or MltC to perform another, and vice versa, as none of these LTGs are independently capable of supporting growth.

While the ∆6 and ∆7 mutants grew at wild-type growth rates in LB medium when cultures were started from a 100-fold dilution of saturated overnight cultures, we noticed a dilution-dependent exacerbation of growth and morphology defects (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s1">Figure 2—figure supplement 1</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s2">Figure 2—figure supplement 2</xref>).

To dissect potential roles for LTGs in cell envelope integrity maintenance, we subjected the ∆6 and ∆7 mutants to growth in low osmolarity medium. Similar to the morphology and growth defects in LB, both mutants were sensitive to low-salt conditions in a dilution-dependent manner (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3A</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s1">Figure 3—figure supplement 1</xref>). Interestingly, the ∆7 LTG mutant grew at wild-type rate during the initial growth period before a rapid decrease in OD<sub>600</sub> (indicative of lysis), suggesting that it is not the initial shock of changing osmotic conditions that kills this mutant, but rather some cumulative damage during growth in low-salt conditions (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3A</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s1">Figure 3—figure supplement 1A</xref>). Importantly, this rules out a simple cell envelope defect as a cause of LTG-deficient mutant osmosensitivity. We then sought to dissect the contributions of individual LTGs to salt sensitivity.

Several LTGs (MltA, MltB, Slt70, and EcMltE) were able to rescue ∆6 LTG growth in LB0N at higher dilutions (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s2">Figure 3—figure supplement 2</xref>), but none could rescue ∆7 growth in LB0N except MltG, which only partially restored growth to ∆6 mutant levels (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s2">Figure 3—figure supplement 2</xref>).

In contrast, inactivation of <italic>opgH</italic> was only able to restore growth yield of the ∆7 LTG mutant in LB0N from a 10<sup>–2</sup> inoculum (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3D</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s1">Figure 3—figure supplement 1E</xref>), but not from greater dilutions, nor from a 10<sup>–5</sup> inoculum in LB (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s1">Figure 3—figure supplement 1C and D</xref>), indicating that the ∆7 LTG mutant has additional exponential growth-dependent defects unique from the ∆6 LTG mutant. Interestingly, OpgH orthologues in <italic>E. coli</italic> and <italic>Yersinia pseudotuberculosis</italic> have also been ascribed a moonlighting function, tying carbon availability with cell length by inhibiting FtsZ filamentation when UDP-glucose levels are high in the cell (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Hill et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib49">Quintard et al., 2015</xref>).

Additionally, alignment of <italic>V. cholerae</italic> OpgH with <italic>E. coli</italic> and <italic>Y. pseudotuberculosis</italic> suggests that it lacks much of the N-terminal domain that was shown to interact with FtsZ in <italic>E. coli</italic> (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s3">Figure 3—figure supplement 3</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Hill et al., 2013</xref>).</p><p>We consequently considered a model where accumulation of periplasmic glucans is detrimental to ∆LTG mutants, for example, via periplasmic crowding or an increase in periplasmic osmolarity.

The <italic>Bacillus subtilis sacB</italic> gene product, which is secreted and functions extracellularly (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib47">Pereira et al., 2001</xref>), isomerizes and polymerizes sucrose monomers into levan molecules up to several kD (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib59">Tanaka et al., 1980</xref>), molecules much too large to escape the Gram-negative periplasm through outer membrane porins. This is often exploited in allelic exchange methods for mutant generation as a means of counterselection (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib55">Steinmetz et al., 1983</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Gay et al., 1983</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Blomfield et al., 1991</xref>), where, for example, WT <italic>V. cholerae</italic> is sensitive to <italic>sacB</italic> expression in LB0N + sucrose. We hypothesized that the ∆LTG mutants might be hypersensitive to periplasmic levan synthesis even in standard LB salt conditions (1% W/V). To test this, we engineered strains overexpressing <italic>sacB</italic>. Consistent with the use of <italic>sacB</italic> as a counterselection method under low-salt conditions, the wild-type is sensitive to <italic>sacB</italic> induction on LB0N (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s4">Figure 3—figure supplement 4</xref>), but not LB.

Collectively, our data suggest that ∆LTG mutants suffer from either hyperosmotic stress or excessive molecular crowding in the periplasm, which can be exacerbated through the induction of long-chain polysaccharides.</p></sec><sec id="s2-6"><title>PG transglycosylase activity causes ∆6 LTG mutant periplasmic stress</title><p>Based on our model that accumulation of polysaccharides in the periplasm is toxic, we predicted that accumulation of uncrosslinked PG strands caused by uninterrupted GT activity during TP inhibition, for example, by β-lactams (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Cho et al., 2014</xref>) (a process termed ‘futile cycling’ when coupled with LTG-mediated degradation), should exacerbate LTG-deficient mutant sickness, and this has indeed been shown with Slt70 in <italic>E. coli</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Cho et al., 2014</xref>). To test this hypothesis, we assessed susceptibility of ∆LTG mutants to cell wall-acting antibiotics with varying ability to induce futile cycling. In a disk diffusion assay, the ∆6 and ∆7 LTG mutants were hypersensitive to inducers of futile cycling, that is, general PBP inhibition by Penicillin G (PenG) as well as to inhibition of specific PBPs including PBP3 (aztreonam), PBP2 (mecillinam), and PBP1b (cefsulodin) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4A</xref>). Conversely, both ∆6 and ∆7 mutants exhibited wild-type sensitivity to moenomycin and fosfomycin, both of which inhibit cell wall synthesis without inducing futile cycling. Thus, β-lactam sensitivity of LTG-deficient mutants is not necessarily tied to simple inhibition of cell wall synthesis, but potentially also to periplasmic crowding due to the accumulation of uncrosslinked PG strands. Curiously, the ∆7 LTG mutant was hypersensitive to MreB inhibition by MP265. This suggests that in the absence of other LTGs MltG contributes to survival upon Rod system insufficiency through an unknown mechanism.</p><fig-group><fig id="fig4" position="float"><label>Figure 4.</label><caption><title>Lytic transglycosylase (LTG) mutants are hypersensitive to antibiotics promoting periplasmic peptidoglycan (PG) accumulation.</title><p>(<bold>A</bold>) Sensitivity to Penicillin G (PenG), aztreonam (AZTM), mecillinam (Mec), cefsulodin (Cef), moenomycin (Moeno), MP265, and fosfomycin (Fos) measured as zone of inhibition (ZOI) in a disk diffusion assay.

After up to 3 hr of treatment with PenG (100 μg/mL, 20× MIC) and continued incubation with BADA, the ∆6 and ∆7 LTG mutant spheroplasts accumulated strong periplasmic BADA signal compared to the wild-type spheroplasts in which cell wall material is presumably completely degraded and removed from the periplasm (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4B</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s1">Figure 4—figure supplement 1</xref>). Meanwhile, in the ∆6 and ∆7 LTG mutants, uncrosslinked PG likely accumulates due to aberrant GT activity.

However, inhibition of cell wall synthesis upstream of GT activity using fosfomycin (500 μg/mL) (which is expected to result in sacculus degradation without induction of futile cycling) did not result in pronounced BADA accumulation in the periplasm, suggesting that the increasing BADA signal observed during penicillin treatment does not solely reflect retention of labeled debris from the degraded sacculus, but indeed is the result of ongoing cell wall synthesis (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4B</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s2">Figure 4—figure supplement 2</xref>). The diffuse nature of the BADA signal additionally suggests that the PG in the ∆6 and ∆7 spheroplasts is solubilized debris trapped in the periplasm, as opposed to a thin, intact layer of peripheral PG.

Accumulating PG debris released during PG synthesis could, in principle, increase periplasmic osmolarity and/or crowding, explaining defects associated with low-salt conditions and periplasmic polysaccharide accumulation. We therefore sought to quantify soluble, periplasmic PG debris within crude cell lysates (excluding PG released into the growth medium). Canonical PG architecture analysis relies on SDS-boiled sacculi isolated by ultra-centrifugation, which permits sacculus characterization (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1D</xref>, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="supp1">Supplementary file 1</xref>), but ignores solubilized, uncrosslinked (freely diffusing) PG fragments associated with PG turnover processes such as those potentially mediated by LTGs. We thus analyzed fragments that remained soluble after sedimentation of purified sacculi, that is, PG material that freely accumulates within the periplasm (or inside the cell) but is not attached to the cell wall. Since entire periplasmic PG strands cannot be easily resolved using subsequent LC-MS analysis, we also digested the soluble PG fraction with muramidase (to generate smaller monomers suitable for LC-MS detection) and then compared muramidase-treated vs. untreated traces to determine soluble PG architecture (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5A</xref>).

By comparing the muramidase-treated vs. untreated samples, we can infer the native state of these M4 and M4N (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5A, B, and D</xref>), that is, determine whether these species occur predominantly as monomers or as parts of PG polymers in vivo. Both species were significantly depleted in the muramidase-untreated samples, suggesting that in vivo they are part of polymeric, uncrosslinked PG strands. It is important to note that M4 monomers are not intermediates of cell wall synthesis (which proceeds from a tripeptide directly to pentapeptide due to addition of preformed D-Ala-D-Ala dipeptide) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Barreteau et al., 2008</xref>). This, in conjunction with a strong muramidase-treatment-dependence of the abundance of M4, excludes a cytoplasmic origin of this species. It is also interesting to note that, unlike the WT, <italic>mltG::kan</italic>, and even ∆6 LTG mutant, the ∆7 LTG appears to have a disproportionately large pool of polymeric M4 species (muramidase-dependent) compared to M4N species, suggesting that either the soluble PG strands in the ∆7 LTG mutant are extremely long or perhaps do not ubiquitously terminate in anhMurNAc residues. The abundance of soluble PG strands decreased in stationary phase (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5CE</xref>, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="supp2">Supplementary file 2</xref>), which suggests that in the LTG-deficient mutants these strands are somehow cleared by either RlpA, an unrecognized LTG, or a cryptic PG hydrolase. Reduction of these uncrosslinked strands in stationary phase is consistent with the alleviation of morphology defects observed as cells exit exponential growth (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s3">Figure 2—figure supplement 3</xref>).</p><p>We next asked how these polymeric, uncrosslinked PG strands might be generated. Since EPs have been suggested to be essential for sacculus expansion during cell elongation, we hypothesized that these soluble strands may reflect EP activity, which would imply that EPs do not simply relax PG crosslinking (as commonly assumed), but also might excise entire strands that accumulate – at least transiently – in the periplasm. To test this hypothesis, we depleted the major housekeeping EP ShyA (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Dörr et al., 2013</xref>) from a ∆6 LTG mutant and found that the most abundant monomer species, M4, was reduced in a ShyA-dependent manner in both WT and ∆6 LTG mutants (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5F</xref>, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="supp3">Supplementary file 3</xref>). This strongly suggests that ShyA produces the majority of the uncrosslinked strands in the periplasm. Curiously, depletion of ShyA in the ∆6 LTG background resulted in large, irregular cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5s1">Figure 5—figure supplement 1</xref>), suggesting a cell envelope defect upon EP insufficiency. Additionally, ShyA was required for ∆6 LTG mutant colony formation on LB plates, but ∆6 LTG liquid cultures depleted for ShyA remained viable and could be rescued on plates restoring <italic>shyA</italic> expression (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5s1">Figure 5—figure supplement 1</xref>). Altogether, the data suggest that EPs excise entire PG strands that accumulate in the periplasm until they are later cleared by LTGs.</p></sec></sec><sec id="s3" sec-type="discussion"><title>Discussion</title><p>Despite decades of work and a renewed research focus in the last few years, we still lack a fundamental understanding of how bacteria harness both PG synthesis and constant degradation to build and maintain an essential and dynamic wall structure that is able to withstand a high internal turgor pressure. Even the basic physiological function of many cell wall cleavage enzymes (‘autolysins’) remains unknown. The exact contributions of LTGs to cell growth, for example, have remained elusive, mainly due to the high level of apparent redundancy of these enzymes, which hampered classical genotype-phenotype association analyses. While circumstantial evidence abounds, no collective physiological characterization of essential LTG function has been conducted in any organism, and even cases of demonstrated synthetic lethal relationships are rare and rely on indirect evidence (inability to delete LTG genes) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Heidrich et al., 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Chaput et al., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib52">Scheurwater and Clarke, 2008</xref>).

Members of LTG families 1A (Slt70), 1D (MltD), and 6A (RlpA) can support growth independent of all other natively encoded LTGs from families 1B, 1E, 2A, 3A, and 5A. Certain <italic>V. cholerae</italic> LTGs additionally exhibit complementary genetic relationships in the absence of all other LTGs, implying there are at least two essential roles for LTGs. For example, while neither MltG, MltA, MltB, nor MltC can support growth on their own, strains expressing the MltG/ MltA, MltG/MltB, or MltG/MltC pairs are each viable. Surprisingly, and importantly, essential LTG activities may not require conserved protein-protein interactions as suggested by the viability of a <italic>V. cholerae</italic> mutant expressing non-native <italic>E. coli</italic> MltE as its sole LTG. Scheurwater and Clarke unsuccessfully but informatively attempted to inactivate <italic>mltF</italic> in an <italic>E. coli</italic> ∆6 LTG (∆<italic>mltABCDE</italic> ∆<italic>slt70</italic>), suggesting that the essentiality of LTG activity is conserved between <italic>E. coli</italic> and <italic>V. cholerae,</italic> and that MltF and MltG may not be functionally redundant in <italic>E. coli</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib52">Scheurwater and Clarke, 2008</xref>). In contrast, <italic>mltF</italic> inactivation is not synthetically lethal with ∆<italic>mltABCD</italic> ∆<italic>slt70</italic> in <italic>V. cholerae</italic>. In fact, restoring MltF expression in the ∆6 and ∆7 LTG background is toxic, indicating that <italic>V. cholerae</italic> and <italic>E. coli</italic> exhibit different genetic relationships between homologs of the same LTGs. This is perhaps most strongly exemplified by the conservation of RlpA in both species, where <italic>E. coli</italic> RlpA has no detectable LTG activity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Jorgenson et al., 2014</xref>), yet <italic>V. cholerae</italic> RlpA can perform essential functions as the sole LTG. Recently, the hydrolytic enzyme DigH in <italic>E. coli</italic> was shown to be functionally similar to LTGs by contributing to the resolution of septal PG during daughter cell separation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib68">Yakhnina and Bernhardt, 2020</xref>). The activity of DigH (of which <italic>V. cholerae</italic> does not possess a strong homolog) may explain why <italic>E. coli</italic> does not appear to require RlpA LTG activity; this LTG-like physiological role for a hydrolytic enzyme also suggests that we may need to look beyond LTGs to fully address the roles for glycosidic bond cleavage within PG. Another recent example of glycosidases serving as functional analogues includes MpgA from <italic>Staphylococcus aureus,</italic> which shares enough homology with MltG to be identified bioinformatically as a YceG-family LTG but harbors a single active site mutation to impart a muramidase mechanism of PG cleavage (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib58">Taguchi et al., 2021</xref>).</p><p>The functional redundancy of LTGs is also likely the root of an apparent paradox. Release of new PG strands from undecaprenyl pyrophosphate should be an essential function as anchoring of PG to the inner membrane is toxic (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib56">Suzuki et al., 2002</xref>) and PG release is likely necessary for lipid carrier recycling. Yet MltG, the highly conserved ‘PG terminase,’ or more generally, ‘PG release factor,’ which associates with PG synthetic complexes to release new strands, is not essential. MltG can be inactivated in wild-type <italic>V. cholerae</italic> (and <italic>E. coli</italic>) without significant consequence, but our ∆7 LTG (<italic>mltG</italic>-null) mutant lost viability upon sustained growth in exponential phase in LB. It is therefore likely that other LTGs can partially complement for PG release activity. The dilution-dependent ∆7 LTG growth defect further suggests that either RlpA has at least partial PG release activity and/or that during brief growth in exponential phase PG release activity is nonessential. MltG essentiality (or near-essentiality) can thus perhaps only be appreciated in a multiple LTG background under conditions where PG release activity is expected to be most important. This is also evidenced by the increased sensitivity of the ∆7 LTG mutant to hypo-osmotic conditions that cannot be rescued via the same mechanisms that rescue the ∆6 LTG mutant, that is, inactivation of OPG synthesis, as well as hypersensitivity to MreB inhibitor MP265. All of these defects point to a unique, MltG-dependent, conditionally essential LTG function. While this study has focused on clearance of soluble PG debris, an activity that would perhaps only be critical in organisms with a membrane-confined periplasmic space, PG release factors analogous in function to MltG are broadly conserved even in Gram-positive organisms, additionally demonstrating a necessity for further investigation into the role of PG release in bacterial cell wall homeostasis.</p></sec><sec id="s3-2"><title>LTGs manage the periplasmic environment</title><p>By analyses of soluble PG, we discovered that even wild-type <italic>V. cholerae</italic> accumulates loose strands of uncrosslinked PG of periplasmic origin (detected as muramidase-dependent, soluble M4 products) and that production of these strands is dependent on the EP ShyA. PG strands appear to accumulate to detrimental levels in the ∆6 and ∆7 mutants, and we thus propose that processing soluble PG is a major collective function of LTGs. PG strand accumulation induces hypersensitivity to other polymeric sugars in the periplasm, such as OPGs, SacB-generated levans, and β-lactam-induced futile cycling products. Since these hypersensitivities are not shared by a ∆<italic>ampG</italic> mutant, previously demonstrated to accumulate small PG monomers, this polysaccharide toxicity may arise from the fact that these large polymers (PG, OPGs, or levans) cannot diffuse out through OM porins, accumulating in a growth and/or substrate-dependent manner. This would inappropriately increase the osmolarity and/or cause excessive crowding (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib54">Sochacki et al., 2011</xref>) of the periplasm to interfere with normal growth-related processes, as exemplified by the mild division defect of the <italic>V. cholerae</italic> LTG-deficient mutants.</p><p>While periplasmic crowding can clearly occur in Gram-negative bacteria due to their diffusion-limiting OM, it is intriguing to consider implications for Gram-positives, where LTGs are likewise conserved, and the cell wall may not provide a meaningful diffusion barrier to long PG strands. We propose three possible (and testable) scenarios for the role of LTGs in Gram-positive bacteria. For example, only PG release activity might be essential in Gram-positives. It is also conceivable that LTGs are nonessential in Gram-positive bacteria. Lastly, ‘periplasmic’ crowding may in fact be detrimental in Gram-positive bacteria: <italic>B. subtilis</italic> PG, for example, is very long chained, and it is conceivable that PG may constitute a reasonable diffusion barrier against such long strands.</p></sec><sec id="s3-3"><title>Broader implications for LTGs in PG dynamics</title><p>Our data suggest that the most important roles for LTGs may not include ‘making space’ for new PG insertion, as has been assumed for fundamental models of PG synthesis. More likely, LTGs clear the periplasm of most PG debris generated by EPs during normal growth by facilitating either recycling or release of small fragments into the environment (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6</xref>). As such, this collectively essential function of LTGs may not be tied to a direct influence on PG synthesis. Importantly, uncrosslinked strands are not a deviant feature unique to the LTG-deficient mutants nor β-lactam treatment (though they become more apparent under these conditions) as they were also detectable in the wild-type during normal growth. Detection of EP-dependent, uncrosslinked PG strands suggests that EP activity might be temporally separated from LTG-mediated turnover of those PG strands. This is seemingly contrary to pervasive models proposing a synchronized synthetic/autolytic complex that digests old PG while simultaneously building new PG. If such a complex exists, we propose that LTGs collectively maintain an important role complementary to it, but not inevitably as part it.</p><fig id="fig6" position="float"><label>Figure 6.</label><caption><title>Model for lytic transglycosylase (LTG)-mediated removal of toxic peptidoglycan (PG) debris.</title><p>(<bold>A</bold>) Endopeptidases (EPs, yellow) excise PG strands (red) from the sacculus (blue), permitting sacculus expansion.

Inactivation of <italic>sltY</italic> in <italic>E. coli,</italic> for example, can promote β-lactam resistance by upregulating L,D-crosslinking activity of L,D-transpeptidase LdtD (YcbB), presumably due to the increased presence of uncrosslinked glycan strands under these conditions (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib64">Voedts et al., 2021</xref>). It is possible that one function of L,D-TPs is to patch holes in the sacculus via readily available soluble PG strands, constituting an innate ‘bike tire repair kit’ for the bacterial cell wall. Future studies of this LTG-mediated turnover of uncrosslinked PG could be critical for understanding PG repair mechanisms, as well as general periplasmic homeostasis, both of which have been historically elusive topics.</p></sec></sec><sec id="s4" sec-type="materials|methods"><title>Materials and methods</title><table-wrap id="keyresource" position="anchor"><label>Key resources

Transformation efficiency was calculated as a ratio of kanR CFU to all strepR CFU.</p></sec><sec id="s4-4"><title>Western blot analysis</title><p>Expression of translational mCherry fusions was induced in WT <italic>V. cholerae</italic> with 1 mM IPTG in LB and grown to OD<sub>600</sub> ~ 0.6. Cells were harvested by centrifugation (9500 × <italic>g</italic>, 15 min) at room temperature and resuspended in 1% SDS + 10 mM dithiothreitol (DTT) lysis buffer. Resuspended cells were incubated at 95°C for 3 min, then sonicated 4 × 5 s at 20% amplitude. Standard Western blots against mCherry were performed using polyclonal mCherry antibody (GeneTex #GTX59788) and detection by IRDye 800CW secondary antibody (LI-COR #926-32211). After imaging for mCherry, the same blots were then reincubated with monoclonal RpoA antibody (BioLegend #663104) detected by IRDye 800CW secondary antibody on an Odyssey CLx imaging device (LI-COR).</p></sec><sec id="s4-5"><title>Growth rate experiments</title><p>Saturated overnight cultures used for growth curve experiments were washed once and resuspended in final growth media, normalizing to OD<sub>600</sub> 2.0. Normalized cell suspensions were serially diluted into 200 μL growth media and incubated in a Bioscreen growth plate reader (Growth Curves America) at 37°C with random shaking at maximum amplitude, and OD<sub>600</sub> recorded at 5 min intervals. Calculations of doublings per hour (DPH) were performed in R as previously described (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib42">Mueller et al., 2019</xref>). Briefly, logarithmic regressions were fitted to sections of growth curves with &gt;5 consecutive values corresponding to OD<sub>600</sub> 0.03–0.1 (for 10<sup>–2</sup> diluted inocula) or OD<sub>600</sub> 0.01–0.1 (for &lt;10<sup>–3</sup> diluted inocula). Logarithmic regressions of ≥3 replicates with fit value r<sup>2</sup> &gt;0.95 were used to estimate mean DPH for each strain in each growth condition. Growth rates were not calculated for samples that did not reach OD<sub>600</sub> 0.1 either through absence of detectable growth or lysis prior to reaching OD<sub>600</sub> 0.1. Growth rates were also not calculated for replicates that were subsequently determined to be suppressors or grew due to irreproducible adaptation. Means within strains between dilution factors and between strains within dilution factors were compared using a two-way ANOVA and Tukey HSD post-hoc test.</p></sec><sec id="s4-6"><title>Morphology analysis by microscopy</title><p>Strains were grown as described in the figure legends and imaged without fixation on LB 0.8% agarose using a Leica DMi8 inverted microscope. Phase-contrast images were analyzed using MicrobeJ. Default parameter settings were applied, and features (septa) were defined as 25% constriction of cell width. Cell outlines were manually edited as needed.</p></sec><sec id="s4-7"><title>Sacculus composition analysis</title><p>PG composition from insoluble sacculi samples was analyzed as described previously with some modifications (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Hong, 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Desmarais et al., 2013</xref>). Briefly, cells were harvested and resuspended in boiled 5% SDS for 1 hr. Sacculi were repeatedly washed by ultracentrifugation (110,000 rpm, 10 min, 20°C) with MilliQ water until SDS was totally removed. Samples were treated with 20 μg Proteinase K (1 hr, 37°C) for removal of Braun’s lipoprotein, and finally treated with muramidase (100 μg/mL) for 16 hr at 37°C. Muramidase digestion was stopped by boiling, and coagulated proteins were removed by centrifugation (14,000 rpm, 15 min). For sample reduction, the pH of the supernatants was adjusted to pH 8.5–9.0 with sodium borate buffer and sodium borohydride was added to a final concentration of 10 mg/mL. After incubating for 30 min at room temperature, the sample’s pH was adjusted to pH 3.5 with orthophosphoric acid.</p><p>UPLC analyses of muropeptides were performed on a Waters UPLC system (Waters Corporation, USA) equipped with an ACQUITY UPLC BEH C18 Column, 130 Å, 1.7 μm, 2.1 mm × 150 mm (Waters, USA) and a dual-wavelength absorbance detector. Elution of muropeptides was detected at 204 nm. Muropeptides were separated at 45°C using a linear gradient from buffer A (formic acid 0.1% in water) to buffer B (formic acid 0.1% in acetonitrile) in an 18 min run, with a 0.25 mL/min flow.</p><p>Relative total PG amount was calculated by comparison of the total intensities of the chromatograms (total area) from three biological replicas normalized to the same OD<sub>600</sub> and extracted with the same volumes. Muropeptide identity was confirmed by MS/MS analysis using a Xevo G2-XS QTof system (Waters Corporation) (see next section for details). Quantification of muropeptides was based on their relative abundances (relative area of the corresponding peak) normalized to their molar ratio. Analyses were performed in biological triplicates, and means were compared with unpaired <italic>t</italic>-tests.</p></sec><sec id="s4-8"><title>Soluble peptidoglycan analysis</title><p>Sample preparation of soluble PG samples was performed as follows. Bacteria cultures were harvested by centrifugation (4000 rpm, 20 min, 4°C). Cell pellets were gently resuspended and washed twice with ice-cold 0.9% NaCl solution. After pelleting the cells again by centrifugation, they were resuspended in 1 mL water and boiled for 30 min. Samples were centrifuged again to remove cell debris at 14,000 rpm for 15 min, and soluble fractions were transferred to new tubes. Next, samples were filtered using 0.2 μm pore size filters. Half of the sample was treated with muramidase (100 μg/mL) for 16 hr at 37°C. Muramidase digestion was stopped by boiling, and coagulated proteins were removed by centrifugation (14,000 rpm, 15 min). Finally, sample pH was adjusted to pH 3.5 with orthophosphoric acid. When needed, samples were diluted or concentrated by speed vacuum.</p><p>Soluble muropeptides were detected and characterized by MS/MS analysis using a Xevo G2-XS QTof system (Waters Corporation) equipped with an ACQUITY UPLC BEH C18 Column (130 Å, 1.7 µm, 2.1 mm × 150 mm; Waters). Muropeptides were separated at 45°C using a linear gradient from buffer A (formic acid 0.1% in water) to buffer B (formic acid 0.1% in acetonitrile) in an 18 min run, with a 0.25 mL/min flow. The QTOF-MS instrument was operated in positive ionization mode. Detection of muropeptides was performed by MS<sup>E</sup> to allow for the acquisition of precursor and product ion data simultaneously using the following parameters: capillary voltage at 3.0 kV, source temperature to 120°C, desolvation temperature to 350°C, sample cone voltage to 40 V, cone gas flow 100 L/hr, desolvation gas flow 500 L/hr, and collision energy (CE): low CE: 6 eV and high CE ramp: 15–40 eV. Mass spectra were acquired at a speed of 0.25 s/scan. The scan was in a range of 100–2000 <italic>m/z</italic>. Data acquisition and processing was performed using UNIFI software package (Waters Corporation).</p><p>An in-house compound library built in UNIFI was used for detection and identification of muropeptides. Subsequent identification and confirmation of each muropeptide were performed by comparison of the retention times and mass spectrometric data to known samples. Quantification was performed by integrating peak areas from extracted ion chromatograms of the corresponding <italic>m/z</italic> value of each muropeptide and normalized to their molar ratio. Soluble muropeptide analyses were performed in biological triplicates, and means were compared with unpaired <italic>t</italic>-tests.</p></sec><sec id="s4-9"><title>Antibiotic sensitivity</title><p>For zone of inhibition assays, a lawn of saturated overnight culture was spread on an LB plate and allowed to dry for 15 min.

It had been previously assumed these enzymes cut glycan strands to make room for the insertion of new glycans. However, results presented in this manuscript demonstrate these enzymes have a very different, yet essential role in degrading uncrosslinked glycan strands in the periplasm. The authors further demonstrate that in the absence of lytic transglycosylases cells undergo periplasmic stress due a toxic accumulation of these ‘free strands’ in the periplasm.

Your article has been reviewed by 3 peer reviewers, and the evaluation has been overseen by a Reviewing Editor and Gisela Storz as the Senior Editor. The following individual involved in review of your submission has agreed to reveal their identity: Ethan Garner (Reviewer #2).</p><p>The reviewers have discussed their reviews with one another, and the Reviewing Editor has drafted this to help you prepare a revised submission.</p><p>Essential revisions:</p><p>1. Whilst the study is well executed, direct evidence that indeed soluble macromolecular peptidoglycan is being accumulated in the periplasm is missing. Figure 5 presents indirect and qualitative data only. The fluorescent data with BADA labelling could be used to quantify the levels of accumulation in the periplasm. This can be easily done using the existing images by quantifying the fluorescence per cell in each condition/mutant. However, this is still indirect as there is no proof that the BADA accumulation occurs due to incorporation and retention in soluble macromolecular peptidoglycan. If the authors can provide further evidence, this will strengthen their case. Alternatively, if possible, the authors can perform radiolabeling of the peptidoglycan and show that there is more of soluble radiolabeled peptidoglycan per cell in the mutants. If such experiments are not possible, fluorescence microscopy will be acceptable.</p><p>2. The authors show a catalytic mutant of RlpA is unable to sustain growth as the only LTG in the cell. However, their wording around RlpA in general is confusing. In the text they note that their δ_7 mutant, which encodes RlpA, 'has no highly active LTGs' (lines 130-131). Does that imply that RlpA is not an LTG? In the discussion they note that <italic>E. coli</italic> RlpA has no LTG activity. Is this enzyme known to have LTG activity in <italic>V. cholerae</italic>? One important control would be to show that the catalytically inactive protein is stable (i.e. that the defect is not due to protein misfolding). This could be supported by looking at protein stability via Western or even quantifying the fluorescence data in Figure S3b</p><p>Other points that must be addressed:</p><p>1. Figure 5. The authors only present the data for M4N and M4. Does that mean that the soluble peptidoglycan is exclusively composed of polymerized M4? Aren't there any other structures such M5 or M3 or dimers?</p><p>2. It would have been also important to show that the accumulation occurs under the other conditions tested such as during β-lactam treatment (Figure 4) but not with moenomycin or Fosfomycin, and that the threshold is reduced when sacB is expressed in the presence of sucrose. Can the authors generate such data?</p><p>3. Given that the LTGs are conserved in both gram-negative and positive bacteria, the proposed function of the LTGs becomes a bit confusing, as uncrosslinked strands made by gram-positive bacteria should really diffuse out of the periplasmic space. Thus, it would be beneficial if the authors discuss the implications of these findings (and their model) in light of gram-positives and the conservation of LTGs</p><p>4. Figure S2 shows that, even in WT cells, the induction of RPLA seems to give an advantage under spot dilutions, a point not noted in the text. Can the authors explain this, or at least give their hypothesis why this occurs?</p><p>5. It would help to define in the figure legend of 3a that this is low salt media (most readers will not notice or understand &quot;LB0N&quot;).</p><p>6. S3b-d could be better explained in the text – The localization studies with this mutant are stated in a very summarized way; by reading the text, it just appears to be based on previous studies. Thus 1-2 sentences referring to the localization studies would be helpful.</p><p>7. In figure 4, MP265 is labeled a GT inhibitor. This is not technically correct and should be corrected. Maybe &quot;rod complex inhibitor?&quot;</p><p>8. Figures 4b and 4c should be better explained. Currently, it is stated that &quot;we visualized the fate of PG during antibiotic treatment using the cell wall label BADA.&quot; While that statement would make sense, the figure shows spheroplasts, which is not made clear in the figure legend of this figure or the supplementary figures. Adding in a small amount of experimental detail would help the reader understand the experiment (that spheroplast allows discrimination of where the FDAAs are, in the cell wall vs. the periplasm).</p><p>9. In general, the manuscript may benefit from some textual changes. Several experiments, or the rationale behind experiments could be explained further. As examples:</p><p>In the introduction, the authors do not provide enough background to understand the system. How many LTG are in <italic>V. cholerae</italic>? What is the prevailing model about LTGs? Are these enzymes &quot;misunderstood&quot; or not well understood? Without this context it is hard to understand the nature of the authors' contributions.</p><p>Line 165: the authors test if other enzymes can function instead of RlpA in δ_6/7, rather than trying to complement a phenotype of δ_6/7?</p><p>Line 120: this assay needs more explanation.</p><p>Lines 360-370: the rationale behind this experiment needs more explanation.</p><p>10. BADA staining experiments could be more clearly explained. Do the authors stain the cells, treat, and then visualize? Are they then studying the fate of old PG? How does BADA get incorporated into PG in <italic>V. cholerae</italic>? Is it through LDT activity or some other way? Without more explanation, it is hard to interpret the results</p><p>11. The authors do a series of experiments showing that delta7 is more susceptible to SacB. What are the data that show sacB produces large polysaccharides molecules in the periplasm rather than (or in addition to) the cytoplasm? This would be important to show as these data are the main test of the model.</p><p>12. The authors have other data that all argue for their model that LTG deficient strains have an excess of periplasmic crowding. The suppressor of δ_opgH is intriguing, but does not restore the morphological defects in δ_7, suggesting that the increase in length during prolonged growth may not be caused by periplasmic crowding, or at least is not alleviated by deletion of OpgH. What then does the deletion of OpgH suppress? The low salt experiments do not necessary provide further clarity. The authors indicate that the cells lyse (line 222) but this is not shown anywhere. Growing the cells continually in low salt may not be the hypoosmotic challenge the authors presume. A challenge typically implies an acute change in osmolarity, rather than a prolonged exposure, which may allow cells to adapt. Can the authors provide an explanation?</p><p><italic>Reviewer #1 (Recommendations for the authors):</italic></p><p>This work is well done.</p><p>I'm only missing a direct evidence that indeed the amounts of soluble macromolecular peptidoglycan is being accumulated in the periplasm.

While BADA staining is not typically a quantitative assay, the trends support our observations that PenG treatment, not Fosfomycin treatment, is associated with PG accumulation in the LTG-deficient mutants. We would like to point out, however, that our soluble PG analysis in Figure 5 does represent direct evidence of soluble strand accumulation. We directly quantify soluble PG material extracted from cells; the muramidase digest is simply a diagnostic necessity as longer PG strands are not well resolved by standard PG methods and UPLC columns. In this regard, the only possible explanation for the detection of M4 species in soluble PG and whose presence depends on muramidase treatment is that these are not free monomeric muropeptides that belong to uncrosslinked PG strands.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>2. The authors show a catalytic mutant of RlpA is unable to sustain growth as the only LTG in the cell. However, their wording around RlpA in general is confusing.

This, as well as the inability of a VcRlpA<sup>D145A</sup> mutant (based on the alignment with catalytically inactive EcRlpA) to rescue native RlpA depletion from the ∆LTG mutants suggests that VcRlpA is an active LTG and that this activity is required in the absence of all other annotated <italic>V. cholerae</italic> LTGs. We agree that “no highly active LTGs” is confusing and we have changed the text to simply describe the ∆7 LTG mutant as being significantly depleted in LTG activity as measured by anhMurNAc abundance in the sacculus. Lastly, we have conducted Western Blots demonstrating in the revised manuscript that our catalytic site mutant is indeed produced and stable (Figure S3).</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Other points that must be addressed:</p><p>1. Figure 5. The authors only present the data for M4N and M4. Does that mean that the soluble peptidoglycan is exclusively composed of polymerized M4?

In tables S3-S8, you will find the complete profile of detected soluble muropeptides, including M5 and M3 species. In an effort not to overwhelm the reader, we have demonstrated the soluble strand phenomenon using the most abundant species, M4 and M4N. There is evidence of a muramidase-dependent enrichment of soluble M3 in the ∆6 and ∆7 mutants as well. Reduced dimers were not detected, and anhDimers were in very low abundance, which further suggests that soluble, uncrosslinked single strands accumulate rather than solubilized crosslinked clusters of strands.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>2. It would have been also important to show that the accumulation occurs under the other conditions tested such as during β-lactam treatment (Figure 4) but not with moenomycin or Fosfomycin, and that the threshold is reduced when sacB is expressed in the presence of sucrose. Can the authors generate such data?</p></disp-quote><p>This is an excellent suggestion and we have indeed started such experiments. However, these analyses are very involved and part of a separate ongoing inquiry into the mechanism of action of β lactam antibiotics and we prefer not to disclose our preliminary data here. We do not believe that these are important experiments to support our conclusions, since in this study we focus on PG homeostasis under physiological conditions (Figure 5), rather than conditions of antibiotic-mediated cell wall stress. We have used cell wall synthesis inhibitors (Figure 4) solely as a tool, i.e. a condition known to exacerbate periplasmic strand accumulation.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>3.

Thus, it would be beneficial if the authors discuss the implications of these findings (and their model) in light of gram-positives and the conservation of LTGs</p></disp-quote><p>We propose that LTGs and/or closely related hydrolases have at least two separable essential functions: As PG release factors (as described previously), and, newly described here, as mitigators of periplasmic crowding. There are at least three possible scenarios for the involvement of LTGs in Gram-positive bacteria: (1) Only PG release activity is essential in Gram-positives, (2) LTGs are non-essential in Gram-positive bacteria, (3) “periplasmic” crowding actually does happen in Gram-positive bacteria <italic>B. subtilis</italic> PG, for example, is very long-chained and it is conceivable that PG actually constitutes a reasonable diffusion barrier against such long strands. We have discussed these ideas in the revised manuscript.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>4.

Can the authors explain this, or at least give their hypothesis why this occurs?</p></disp-quote><p>This might be a misunderstanding: RlpA overexpression does not induce a growth advantage in the WT. Perhaps the reviewer is referring to the fact that the experiment in Figure S2 represents a growth experiment, where the wt simply proliferates between 0 and 3 hours? This has also been clarified in the text.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>5.

Our main point is that LTGs are both poorly-understood (no essential physiological function had been assigned prior to this study) and also misunderstood (as in the PG field they are often lumped in with endopeptidases as “space-making” enzymes that promote PG synthesis). In this study, we outline for the first time a reason for why LTG activity is collectively essential.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Line 165: the authors test if other enzymes can function instead of RlpA in δ_6/7, rather than trying to complement a phenotype of δ_6/7?</p></disp-quote><p>We would argue that this is essentially what we do with our complementation experiments depicted in Figure 1C.

We think that what we visualize is not the fate of old PG (otherwise we would see similar strong stains with Fosfomycin, which inhibits cell wall synthesis upstream of PG strand generation by PBPs/SEDS), but rather visualizes the generation of long, uncrosslinked PG strands due to the inhibition of PBP transpeptidase activity. We have added more explanations of this assay to the revised manuscript.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>11.

The authors have other data that all argue for their model that LTG deficient strains have an excess of periplasmic crowding.

Since MltG seems to be the main PG release factor (at least based on <italic>E. coli</italic>), which can be partially supplanted by collective action of other LTGs, the ∆7 suffers from both PG release defects and periplasmic crowding defects, perhaps more so in an osmotically challenging low salt medium. The evidence for lysis is that at high inoculum (10<sup>-2</sup>) the ∆7 LTG mutant does grow for a short time, but then we observe a drop in OD<sub>600</sub>, indicative of lysis. According to our model, ∆6, on the other hand, which still has MltG, likely suffers only (or mostly) from a periplasmic crowding defect. Deleting periplasmic glucans only mitigates periplasmic crowding (and probably only partially), which does not help the more defective ∆7, which additionally suffers from lack of the postulated second activity.</p><p>The reviewers raise an interesting point regarding the word “challenge”. We indeed specifically make the point that this is not an acute challenge, but rather accumulating damage during prolonged growth, even in salt-free LB. We have thus removed the word “challenge” from the revised manuscript. Importantly, we only use the ∆opgH suppression phenotype as one of many puzzle pieces for our conclusion. The key assay is the direct demonstration of periplasmic soluble PG strands accumulating in both WT and, to a higher degree, the ∆6 LTG mutant (Figure 6).</p></body></sub-article></article>
