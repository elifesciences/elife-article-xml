Elastin and elastin-like peptides are hydrophobic, disordered, and undergo liquid-liquid phase separation upon self-assembly. Despite extensive study, the structure of elastin remains controversial. We use molecular dynamics simulations on a massive scale to elucidate the structural ensemble of aggregated elastin-like peptides. Consistent with the entropic nature of elastic recoil, the aggregated state is stabilized by the hydrophobic effect. However, self-assembly does not entail formation of a hydrophobic core. The polypeptide backbone forms transient, sparse hydrogen-bonded turns and remains significantly hydrated even as self-assembly triples the extent of non-polar side chain contacts. Individual chains in the assembly approach a maximally-disordered, melt-like state which may be called the liquid state of proteins. These findings resolve long-standing controversies regarding elastin structure and function and afford insight into the phase separation of disordered proteins.</p></abstract><kwd-group kwd-group-type="author-keywords"><kwd>molecular dynamics</kwd><kwd>intrinsically-disordered protein</kwd><kwd>self-assembled elastomer</kwd><kwd>phase separation</kwd><kwd>protein aggregation</kwd></kwd-group><kwd-group kwd-group-type="research-organism"><title>Research organism</title><kwd>None</kwd></kwd-group><funding-group><award-group id="fund1"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100000024</institution-id><institution>Canadian Institutes of Health Research</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>MOP84496</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Pomès</surname><given-names>Régis</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund2"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100000038</institution-id><institution>Natural Sciences and Engineering Research Council of Canada</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Rauscher</surname><given-names>Sarah</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund3"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100006126</institution-id><institution>Hospital for Sick Children</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Rauscher</surname><given-names>Sarah</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><funding-statement>The funders had no role in study design, data collection and interpretation, or the decision to submit the work for publication.</funding-statement></funding-group><custom-meta-group><custom-meta specific-use="meta-only"><meta-name>Author impact statement</meta-name><meta-value>Molecular simulations show how hydrophobicity and conformational disorder underlie the phase separation of elastin-like peptides and the elasticity of human tissues.</meta-value></custom-meta></custom-meta-group></article-meta></front><body><sec id="s1" sec-type="intro"><title>Introduction</title><p>The elasticity of skin, lungs, major arteries, and other vertebrate tissues is imparted by the fibrous structural protein, elastin. Networks of elastic fibres are formed in the extracellular matrix from the monomeric precursor, tropoelastin. Elastic fibres are subject to minimal turnover during a lifetime and are highly durable under repetitive physiological strain (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib79">Shapiro et al., 1991</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Davis, 1993</xref>). For example, elastic fibres in the arterial wall enable the tissue to undergo over two billion cycles of extension and relaxation to smooth the flow of blood down the arterial tree, largely without mechanical failure. The remarkable durability and functional resilience of elastic fibres arise from intrinsic features of the monomer. Tropoelastin is a 60 kDa modular protein composed of alternating hydrophobic and cross-linking domains (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib53">Muiznieks et al., 2010</xref>). Although both types of domains contribute to the proper supramolecular assembly and the mechanical properties of the polymeric elastin network, the cross-linking domains are understood to bestow cohesiveness and durability to the material, whereas the hydrophobic domains confer the propensities for self-assembly and elastic recoil (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib71">Rauscher and Pomès, 2012</xref>). Solutions of tropoelastin and elastin-like peptides (ELPs) self-aggregate via liquid-liquid phase separation upon increasing temperature, a process known as coacervation. This process has been shown to be primarily driven by the self-association of hydrophobic domains (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib53">Muiznieks et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib91">Urry et al., 1974</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Bellingham et al., 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib88">Toonkool et al., 2001</xref>). The capacity for temperature-controlled self-assembly make elastin-like peptides well-suited for biomaterials applications (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Almine et al., 2010</xref>) and drug delivery (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib80">Shi et al., 2013</xref>).</p><p>Despite the biological importance of elastin and eighty years of study using a myriad of biophysical techniques (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib47">Meyer and Ferri, 1937</xref>), neither the molecular basis of self-assembly nor the structure of the self-assembled state are known. Numerous structural models of elastin have been proposed, which span a range from highly-ordered (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib93">Venkatachalam and Urry, 1981</xref>) to maximally-disordered (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Hoeve and Flory, 1958</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">Flory, 1974</xref>) and emphasize either the hydrophobic effect (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib93">Venkatachalam and Urry, 1981</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib95">Weis-Fogh and Anderson, 1970</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Gray et al., 1973</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib41">Li et al., 2001a</xref>) or conformational entropy (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Hoeve and Flory, 1958</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">Flory, 1974</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Dorrington et al., 1975</xref>) as the dominant contribution to the elastic recoil force.</p><p>High conformational entropy is the key feature of the earliest model proposed for elastin’s structure: the random network model (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Hoeve and Flory, 1958</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">Flory, 1974</xref>). Based on thermoelasticity measurements indicating that elastin’s recoil force is almost entirely entropic, Hoeve and Flory postulated that elastin’s structure is an isotropic, rubber-like polymer network consisting of cross-linked, random chains (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Hoeve and Flory, 1958</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">Flory, 1974</xref>). However, thermoelasticity measurements on elastin samples were carried out using alcohol diluents (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Hoeve and Flory, 1958</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">Flory, 1974</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Dorrington and McCrum, 1977</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Andrady and Mark, 1980</xref>) and therefore rely on the assumption that alcohols do not significantly perturb the structure of elastin. The validity of this assumption has been questioned (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib95">Weis-Fogh and Anderson, 1970</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Ellis and Packer, 1976</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Gosline, 1978</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Chalmers et al., 1999</xref>) because the sequence composition of elastin is unusually enriched in hydrophobic residues, which likely interact with alcohols. Other types of mechanical studies have been carried out in a wide variety of solvents (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib95">Weis-Fogh and Anderson, 1970</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib44">Lillie and Gosline, 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib81">Silverstein et al., 2015</xref>). Whether or not the idealized random network model applies to the functional state of elastin is not known and remains controversial.</p><p>In contrast to the random network model, specific secondary structure preferences and significant burial of non-polar groups are common features of several other structural models of elastin (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib93">Venkatachalam and Urry, 1981</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib95">Weis-Fogh and Anderson, 1970</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Gray et al., 1973</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib41">Li et al., 2001a</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Gosline, 1978</xref>). Elastin’s highly hydrophobic sequence led several groups to propose that the hydrophobic effect, rather than conformational entropy, is the major driving force of elastic recoil (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib95">Weis-Fogh and Anderson, 1970</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Gray et al., 1973</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib41">Li et al., 2001a</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Gosline, 1978</xref>). Several models were proposed in which non-polar side chains are arranged to exclude water molecules; the most ordered of these models is the β-spiral, which consists of repeated β-turns (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib93">Venkatachalam and Urry, 1981</xref>). While the β-spiral model has been shown to be unstable (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib41">Li et al., 2001a</xref>) spectroscopic data are consistent with the presence of β-turns (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib53">Muiznieks et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib85">Tamburro et al., 2003</xref>).</p><p>To go beyond these largely qualitative and seemingly contradictory models, high-resolution structural information is required. The conformational heterogeneity and self-association of elastin have impeded crystallographic and spectroscopic investigations and present a significant sampling challenge to molecular simulations (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib69">Rauscher and Pomès, 2010a</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib68">Rauscher et al., 2009</xref>). Accordingly, most previous computational studies of elastin-like peptides have been limited to molecular dynamics (MD) simulations of peptide monomers, starting with simulations of ~100 ps in vacuo (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Chang and Urry, 1988</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib94">Wasserman and Salemme, 1990</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib40">Lelj et al., 1992</xref>) and moving on to simulations of ~10–100 ns in explicit water (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib41">Li et al., 2001a</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib81">Silverstein et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib68">Rauscher et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib42">Li et al., 2001b</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib78">Schreiner et al., 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib66">Rauscher et al., 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">Krukau et al., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Glaves et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib43">Li et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Condon et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib74">Reppert et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib86">Tang et al., 2016</xref>). Although some of these studies examined assemblies comprising between 2 and 6 peptides (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib66">Rauscher et al., 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib43">Li et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Condon et al., 2017</xref>), to our knowledge simulations of larger aggregates of elastin-like (or, indeed, other intrinsically-disordered) peptides have never been reported. Moreover, we have shown that attaining statistically-converged sampling of disordered elastin-like peptides necessitates simulation times in the microsecond time-range (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib68">Rauscher et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib70">Rauscher and Pomès, 2010b</xref>).</p><p>To examine the structural and physico-chemical basis for the self-assembly of elastin, we use MD simulations on a massive scale. For the sake of computational feasibility, we neglect cross-linking domains and consider a repetitive sequence, (GVPGV)<sub>7</sub>, modeled on hydrophobic domains of elastin. Although cross-linking domains are required to form elastomeric materials, they do not undergo coacervation on their own and are not required for coacervation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib91">Urry et al., 1974</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Bellingham et al., 2001</xref>). Peptides based on GVPGV and other repetitive motifs from the hydrophobic domains of tropoelastin have been shown to coacervate in the absence of cross-linking domains (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib91">Urry et al., 1974</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib48">Miao et al., 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib52">Muiznieks et al., 2014</xref>). As such, our model system is not designed to capture all the properties of elastin. Instead, we focus on the phase separation of hydrophobic elastin-like domains, which also provides insight into the structural basis of elasticity. All-atom MD simulations of a monomer and an aggregate of 27 peptides, with a combined sampling time exceeding 200 µs, are used to provide the first atomistic description of the conformational ensemble of an elastin-like peptide successively in solution and in aggregated form.</p></sec><sec id="s2" sec-type="results|discussion"><title>Results and discussion</title><sec id="s2-1"><title>Peptide chain dimensions before and after self-assembly</title><p>We first compare the ensembles of the elastin-like peptide in solution (single chain, SC) and as an aggregate (multi-chain, MC) with respect to chain dimensions (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1</xref>).

Instead, water molecules remain within the aggregate (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3a,d,e</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4</xref>) in order to satisfy the hydrogen bonding requirements of backbone groups.

The high degree of hydration of the aggregate (40.0 ± 0.2% water content by mass, based on the number of water molecules hydrogen-bonded to the peptide) is consistent with experimental measurements of water content between 40% and 60% for elastin derived from various species (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Chalmers et al., 1999</xref>).

The fact that this value is nearly identical in the monomer and in the aggregate suggests that internal hydration is independent of size and would also be observed in larger and smaller aggregates.

To understand why aggregation induces peptide expansion (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1a</xref>), we examine our results in terms of solvent quality. In a poor solvent, solute-solute interactions are energetically more favorable than solvent-solute interactions, leading to a collapse of the polymer chain. Inversely, solvent-solute interactions are preferred in a good solvent, leading to chain expansion. In the ideal limit between the two (the so-called ‘θ-solvent’), there is no preference for one type of interaction over the other. In this minimally-constrained state, the polymer becomes maximally disordered. The Flory theorem states that in the liquid, phase-separated state, the ‘polymer melt’, the polymer chains make extensive interactions with one another and become their own θ-solvent, since intramolecular and intermolecular interactions are chemically indistinguishable; as a result of which the chains reach a state of maximal disorder. (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Flory, 1953</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Flory, 1969</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Flory, 1949</xref>) Although disordered protein aggregates have been hypothesized to resemble polymer melts, (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Fields et al., 1992</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib56">Pappu et al., 2008</xref>) whether or not they satisfy the Flory theorem is unknown.</p><p>The aggregated ELP chains are extensively solvated by one another (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2c,f</xref>), suggesting that they may approach the ideal, θ-solvent limit. To quantify the extent to which the chains approach this ideal limit, we compared the intrachain distance scaling of the conformational ensembles in the simulations to the scaling expected for the ideal, θ-solvent limit (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5</xref>). As a model for this ideal state, we use the residue-specific model for a random-coil polypeptide developed by Flory and co-workers (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Flory, 1969</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib49">Miller et al., 1967</xref>). In their model, rotation about the backbone dihedral angles, φ and ψ, is treated as independent of the conformation of neighboring residues in the chain. We update their method to include residue-specific transformation matrices derived directly from the simulation data (see the detailed description of the method in <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="supp1">Supplementary file 1</xref>). The internal distance scaling profile for the Flory model of the ideal state is fit by a power law with exponent α = 0.54, which is very similar to the expected dimensions of an ideal Flory random coil homopolymer, for which α = 0.5 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Flory, 1969</xref>). Similarly, the dimensions of the chains in the aggregate, with an exponent α = 0.46, closely approach the ideal limit as well. In contrast, the dimensions of the ensemble in solution, with an exponent of α = 0.28, are consistent with those of a polymer in a poor solvent, for which α = 1/3. This result is expected, given the highly hydrophobic composition of the ELP sequence, and the fact that water is a poor solvent for hydrophobic residues. The internal distance scaling profile of the chain in solution exhibits a slight upturn at large sequence separations. This deviation from the behavior expected for a perfectly collapsed, globular homopolymer likely arises from the fact that the conformational landscape of the ELP in solution is more complex than that of a simple homopolymer in a poor solvent due to the presence of specific, highly-populated turns (<xref ref-type="table" rid="table1">Table 1</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2b</xref>).</p><fig-group><fig id="fig5" position="float"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.26526.015</object-id><label>Figure 5.</label><caption><title>Intrachain distance scaling and comparison to the ideal, random-coil state.</title><p>Root-mean-square distance, &lt;<italic>r<sub>ij</sub></italic><sup>2</sup>&gt;<sup>1/2</sup>, between residues <italic>i</italic> and <italic>j</italic> as a function of sequence separation, |<italic>i-j</italic>|, for SC (blue) and MC (red), and for the ideal, random coil state modeled using the SC simulations according to the method of Flory <italic>et al.</italic> (black) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Flory, 1969</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib49">Miller et al., 1967</xref>) described in detail in <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="supp1">Supplementary file 1</xref>.

Consistent with this hypothesis, Ramos <italic>et al.</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib65">Ramos et al., 2016</xref>) found no crossover for the shortest chain length of hydrogenated polybutadiene that they studied (36 monomers compared to 35 residues in the chain studied here). The absence of crossover may also be due to insufficient simulation length, or to the fact that the chains remain highly hydrated in the aggregate and are not characteristic of a solvent-excluding melt.</p></sec><sec id="s2-6"><title>Relevance to elastin-like peptides with cross-linking domains</title><p>Despite the moderate size of our aggregate, its melt-like properties suggest that the present study captures the fundamental basis for ELP phase separation. As such, the molecular basis for phase separation uncovered in this study is likely to be relevant to longer ELPs and full-length tropoelastin. In support of this point, our results are in excellent agreement with a recent NMR study of block peptides with alternating cross-linking domains and hydrophobic (GVPGV)<sub>7</sub> domains, successively in solution, in the coacervate, and in materials produced by cross-linking (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib73">Reichheld et al., 2017</xref>). The conformational ensemble of the hydrophobic domain presented in this study is consistent with the NMR results both qualitatively and quantitatively: (i) the peptides are disordered both before and after phase separation; (ii) the secondary structure in the hydrophobic domains consists primarily of sparse and transient β-turns in the VPGV and GVGV repeats, whose population was estimated to be in the range 20–40%, compared to our estimate of 16–20%; (iii) this secondary structure does not change significantly upon phase separation; (iv) phase separation entails formation of non-specific, intermolecular hydrophobic contacts; and (v) the protein-rich liquid phase is significantly hydrated. This broad agreement does not mean that the conformational ensembles of the hydrophobic domains are identical in the two model peptides (if only because of the different length of the polypeptide chains), but it indicates that the structural and physical basis for the self-assembly of the hydrophobic domains is not fundamentally affected by the presence of cross-linking domains.</p></sec><sec id="s2-7"><title>Disordered aggregates: structure and function of self-assembled elastomeric proteins</title><p>The unusual properties of elastin and ELPs set them apart both from more common types of intrinsically disordered proteins (IDPs) that do not self-aggregate, and from proteins that form amyloid upon aggregation. On the one hand, the majority of IDPs have a high charge content and low sequence hydrophobicity, which allows them to avoid self-aggregation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib92">Uversky et al., 2000</xref>), whereas elastin, because of its high content of hydrophobic residues, undergoes self-aggregation. Several computational studies have described structural ensembles of the more common type of IDPs. Among them, the RS peptide, which has a high net charge, was studied in detail using both simulations and experiments (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib67">Rauscher et al., 2015</xref>). Extensive computational studies of IDPs with varying fraction of charged residues have been carried out (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Das and Pappu, 2013</xref>).</p><p>On the other hand, unfolded or misfolded proteins are prone to form ordered amyloid aggregates, but the amino acid composition of elastin precludes both folding and amyloid formation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib66">Rauscher et al., 2006</xref>). While maintaining both disorder and hydration upon aggregation is crucial for elastic recoil, it is equally important that elastin and other self-assembled elastomeric proteins avoid the formation of the cross-β-structure characteristic of amyloid fibrils (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib66">Rauscher et al., 2006</xref>), which are postulated to be a thermodynamically stable state for any polypeptide chain under appropriate solution conditions (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Dobson, 2003</xref>). Like the native state of globular proteins, the structure of amyloids is characterized by a water-excluding core and extensive backbone self-interactions. The liquid-like structure of elastin is incompatible with both protein folding and the formation of amyloid, and it is achieved through a high combined proportion of proline and glycine residues (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib66">Rauscher et al., 2006</xref>). Both proline, with its fixed φ dihedral angle and absence of amide hydrogen, and glycine, with its high entropic penalty for conformational confinement, inhibit the formation of α-helix and β-sheet structure, and serve to maintain a high degree of hydration and structural disorder by preventing the formation of a compact, water-excluding core. The essential role of proline and glycine in governing disorder, hydration, and elasticity was shown to extend to many other self-assembled elastomeric proteins (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib66">Rauscher et al., 2006</xref>), a finding corroborated by a recent study of an array of proline- and glycine-rich disordered proteins (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib64">Quiroz and Chilkoti, 2015</xref>) as well as by studies of various classes of spider silks (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib76">Savage and Gosline, 2008a</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib77">Savage and Gosline, 2008b</xref>). These results point to a fundamental relationship between sequence composition, conformational disorder, and elastomeric properties of self-assembled elastomeric proteins, including elastin, spider silk, and resilin.</p><p>Taken together, these considerations support a model of elastin aggregation and entropic elasticity as shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7</xref>. This model highlights the contributions of the hydrophobic effect and conformational entropy to protein folding, aggregation, and elastic recoil. Although individual chains approach a state of maximal conformational disorder upon aggregation, excluded volume effects are expected to limit the overall conformational entropy of the aggregate because the conformations are dependent upon those of their neighbors in the protein-dense phase. As such, the present study cannot conclude on whether or not conformational entropy contributes to self-assembly. However, our results are qualitatively consistent with rubber-like elasticity, since the extension of disordered, cross-linked hydrophobic chains should lead to a decrease of conformational entropy of the polymerized material as well as of the individual chains. Thus, both the hydrophobic effect and conformational entropy are expected to contribute to elastic recoil, reconciling the random coil and liquid drop models of elasticity.</p><fig id="fig7" position="float"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.26526.022</object-id><label>Figure 7.</label><caption><title>Structural basis of entropic elasticity in self-assembled elastomeric proteins.</title><p>Schematic description of polypeptide main chains (black), non-polar side chains (yellow), solvating water molecules (blue), and peptide-peptide hydrogen bonds (red) in monomeric (SC, top row) and aggregated (MC, bottom row) states.

The model of elastin-like aggregates derived here represents the first detailed model of a protein coacervate. In spite of its moderate size, this molecular system emulates a biphasic liquid. Peptide aggregation is driven at least in part by the hydrophobic effect, which results in a three-fold increase in burial of non-polar groups for each polypeptide chain compared to the monomeric form. In the aggregate, the individual polypeptide chains approach a state of maximal conformational disorder as predicted by the Flory theorem. As such, the above results show how a classic concept of polymer theory, the polymer melt, is realized in an important but poorly-understood structural protein, and demonstrate the relevance of this concept to the self-assembly (coacervation) and mechanical properties of elastin.</p><p>Our results support a unified model of elastin structure and function that recapitulates experimental data and reconciles key aspects of previous qualitative models. The biological function of elastin is incompatible with a unique, ordered structure. In the functional state, its hydrophobic domains form a water-swollen, disordered aggregate characterized by an ensemble of many degenerate conformations with significant backbone hydration and fluctuating local secondary structure. The combination of two entropic forces, the hydrophobic effect and polypeptide chain entropy, governs the elastic recoil central to elastin’s function. These effects are intimately linked. Not only does the replacement of intramolecular contacts between non-polar side chains by intermolecular ones drive elastin self-assembly, it also helps the polypeptide chains of hydrophobic domains approach a state of maximal conformational disorder.</p><p>Remarkably, our findings defy conventional wisdom about protein folding, aggregation, and disorder: (1) although the structure of the aggregated peptide chains is nearly maximally disordered, it is not random but instead contains well-defined and significantly-populated secondary structure elements in the form of hydrogen-bonded turns; (2) however, because these turns are local, sparse, and transient, the polypeptide backbone remains highly hydrated on average; as a result, (3) the hydrophobic side chains cannot form a compact, water-excluding core even though they are significantly buried.</p><p>The detailed model of the liquid phase of proteins obtained here for elastin is of direct relevance to the self-assembly and mechanical properties of other self-assembled elastomeric proteins, with which elastin shares a high content in proline and glycine (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib66">Rauscher et al., 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib64">Quiroz and Chilkoti, 2015</xref>). In addition, by uncovering the structural and physico-chemical basis for the phase separation of elastin, this study also provides a frame of reference for understanding the phase separation of other functional disordered proteins, including the FG-nucleoporins that compose the selectivity barrier of the nuclear pore complex (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib58">Patel et al., 2007</xref>) and low-complexity protein assemblies implicated in the intracellular phase separation of membraneless organelles (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib89">Toretsky and Wright, 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib54">Nott et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Elbaum-Garfinkle et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib51">Molliex et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Feric et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Brangwynne et al., 2015</xref>).

This sequence, derived from a hydrophobic domain of chicken elastin, is the most extensively studied elastin repeat motif (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib53">Muiznieks et al., 2010</xref>). An accumulated simulation time of over 200 µs was required to reach statistical convergence. A description of simulation methods and structural analysis follows.

This combination of force fields was shown to produce conformational ensembles of an intrinsically disordered protein consistent with both SAXS and NMR measurements in an extensive force field comparison (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib67">Rauscher et al., 2015</xref>). This force field combination was also used in a landmark MD simulation study in which proteins of multiple structural classes were folded (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib45">Lindorff-Larsen et al., 2011</xref>).

Detailed structural properties of the peptide such as hydrogen bonding, non-polar contacts, and hydration propensities differ quantitatively between the ensembles obtained with different force fields; in particular, both SC and MC conformational ensembles obtained using OPLS-AA/L are significantly more collapsed than their counterparts obtained using CHARMM 22*. Nevertheless, it should be noted that all of the qualitative conclusions of the present work regarding the structural and physico-chemical basis of elastin self-aggregation are robust to the differences between these force fields.</p><p>To further examine the dependence of our results, particularly as regards the compactness of the isolated peptide in water, on the choice of force field, we repeated some of the simulations with a different force field combination. Specifically, we performed 18 repeats of a 0.5-μs MD trajectory using CHARMM22* with TIP4P-D, a modified water force field proposed by Piana <italic>et al.</italic> to improve the hydration of disordered protein ensembles (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib61">Piana et al., 2015</xref>). This new set of simulations leads to a less-collapsed (GVPGV)<sub>7</sub> monomer (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s2">Figure 1—figure supplement 2</xref>) with size-scaling exponent 0.40, compared to the value of 0.28 obtained with the TIP3P water model (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5s3">Figure 5—figure supplement 3</xref>). We note that the TIP4P-D force field was observed to destabilize the native state of two folded proteins (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib61">Piana et al., 2015</xref>). As such, TIP4P-D may underestimate hydrophobic interactions in the hydrophobic IDP studied here. Nevertheless, the fact that the scaling exponent of our monomeric ELP obtained with TIP4P-D is still less than the ideal limit is consistent with hydrophobic collapse and the overall conclusions of the paper. Consistent with the analysis of hydrogen bonding and non-polar contacts with charmm-modified TIP3P (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2</xref>), GVGV and VPGV β-turns are still the most populated structures in the ensemble obtained using TIP4P-D (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s4">Figure 2—figure supplement 4</xref>). The main difference between the ensembles is a significant reduction in non-polar, non-local contacts in the TIP4P-D ensemble.

Only the ensemble of conformations at 298 K was used for subsequent analysis. In addition to the replica exchange simulation, twenty 1 µs long simulations were carried out in the NPT ensemble at 298 K in order to carry out the analysis of chain dynamics and lifetimes of hydrogen-bonded turns. As described above, eighteen 0.5 µs simulations were carried out using the TIP4P-D water model (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib61">Piana et al., 2015</xref>) to further assess the dependence of the results on force field choice.

We find that the equilibration period represents a significant fraction of the simulation (50%, 2.5 µs). This long equilibration period is due to the slow process of the chains expanding within the aggregate, as well as finding optimal packing. While the chains readily form aggregates (nanosecond timescale), chain expansion (approaching the ideal, unperturbed state) occurs on the microsecond timescale in these simulations (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5s1">Figure 5—figure supplement 1</xref>).

Your article has been reviewed by three peer reviewers, and the evaluation has been overseen by a Reviewing Editor and Arup Chakraborty as the Senior Editor. The following individual involved in review of your submission has agreed to reveal his identity: Robert Best (Reviewer #1).</p><p>The reviewers have discussed the reviews with one another and the Reviewing Editor has drafted this decision to help you prepare a revised submission.</p><p>Summary:</p><p>The paper uses molecular simulations to study the properties of elastin. In extensive simulations of elastin fragments with a simple repeat sequence, the authors find that the peptides are disordered and self-associate to form a dense protein-rich phase. This appears to be the first study that uses all-atom simulations to tackle the formation of liquid-like protein aggregates. The results support many of the features of elastin determined experimentally such as formation of local turn structure, but do not support an overall ordered aggregate which had been proposed in the past. Instead, individual peptides are still able to diffuse, albeit slowly.</p><p>In their reports, the three reviewers raise a number of serious concerns. The main criticisms are that (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib79">1</xref>) the simulation systems are highly simplified and may not adequately capture all relevant properties of real elastin, (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">2</xref>) the significance of the results is not clear because important negative controls and reference simulations are missing, (3) possible force field issues are not assessed, and (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib71">4</xref>) the comparison to experiment is weak. A detailed list of the criticisms follows below. These points would have to be addressed in a revision.</p><p>Essential revisions:</p><p>1) The simulation systems are highly simplified and may not adequately capture all relevant properties of real elastin. Peptides with a simple repeat sequence (VPGVG)<sub>7</sub> are studied. Whereas the pentapeptide and related polypentapeptides have been accepted as suitable mimics for the extensive hydrophobic regions of elastin, it is important to discuss the advantages and possible drawbacks and limitations stemming from the choice of sequence. Of particular concern is the fact that the native protein is largely characterized by alternating hydrophobic and crosslinking domains. Although the hydrophobic domains have sequences similar to the model of this study, they are usually flanked by crosslinking domains that have at least partial α-helical character. As such, it would appear rather unlikely that 27 hydrophobic domains in the native protein would form an aggregate like the one used here.</p><p>2) The significance of the results is not clear because important negative controls are missing. Wouldn't any concentrated solution of peptides with a roughly similar sequence composition behave in the same way, i.e., form a solvated blob? It would help to contrast the elastin results to simulations of IDP peptide fragments that do not aggregate and of IDPs that form &quot;solid&quot; aggregates in simulations using a similar protocol. In particular, is the extent of hydration in the core of the elastin bundle significantly higher than for other aggregating peptides? The authors mention silk and amyloid as two extremes of hydrated and solid aggregates. There are even reports in the literature that show a tendency to fibrillize (Fred W. Keeley, Catherine M. Bellingham and Kimberley A. Woodhouse, Philosophical Transactions: Biological Sciences, Vol. 357, No. 1418, Elastomeric Proteins: Structures, Biomechanical Properties and Biological Roles (Feb. 28, 2002), pp. 185- 189).</p><p>3) The choice of force field seems problematic, because it has been reported to favor overly compact structures in other systems. See e.g. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1</xref> in Piana et al., Curr. Opin. Struct. Biol. v24, p98, 2014, where the scaling of Rg with number of residues comes close to the one-third power, whereas most protein chains in water are closer to ideal chain scaling. Now elastin is quite hydrophobic, so it is possible that all is fine and it should be collapsed anyway, but it would be good to have some discussion of this issue and maybe a comparison with experiments which show that the elastin monomer behavior is reasonable.</p><p>4) The comparison to experiment is rather weak and qualitative at best, and therefore should be strengthened. For instance, can the simulations be related quantitatively to the neutron scattering experiments in Perticaroli et al., 2015? In light of the considerable force field issues in IDP simulations (well documented by work also of the authors!), it is very important to have experimental support. Comparisons to specific experiments should be performed in a way that could, at least in principle rule out, this and/or other models.</p></body></sub-article><sub-article article-type="reply" id="SA2"><front-stub><article-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.26526.028</article-id><title-group><article-title>Author response</article-title></title-group></front-stub><body><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Essential revisions:</p><p>1) The simulation systems are highly simplified and may not adequately capture all relevant properties of real elastin.

Instead, we examine the structural and physical basis for the phase separation of hydrophobic elastin-like domains, which also provides insight into the structural basis of elasticity. Although cross-linking domains are required to form elastomeric materials, to which they confer integrity and durability, they do not undergo phase separation on their own and are not required for phase separation. Numerous studies from the labs of Tony Weiss, Fred Keeley, and Tony Tamburro over the past couple of decades have established that hydrophobic domains drive the phase separation of full-length tropoelastin. Accordingly, elastin-like peptides modeled on hydrophobic domains of tropoelastin but lacking cross-linking domains coacervate on their own. In addition, the hydrophobic domains are also thought to confer elastic recoil to elastin. Together with computational feasibility, these are the reasons why we chose to model hydrophobic domains. <bold>–</bold> See revised text in the first paragraph of the Introduction.</p><p>Inasmuch as hydrophobic domains drive the phase separation of full-length tropoelastin and the elasticity of polymerized elastin, it is likely that the molecular basis for phase separation and elastic recoil uncovered in this study is relevant to full-length tropoelastin. This point is corroborated by a recent NMR study of the self-assembly and polymerization of elastin-like block-copolymer peptides consisting of alternating cross-linking and (GVPGV)<sub>7</sub> domains (Reichheld et al., PNAS May 2017). The structure of our isolated (GVPGV)<sub>7</sub> domains is essentially preserved in the block copolymers: they are disordered, hydrated, and retain the same local secondary structure, which consists of transient β-turns, in soluble and phase-separated forms; and they form extensive, non-specific hydrophobic contacts upon phase separation.</p><p>This broad agreement does not mean that the conformational ensembles of the hydrophobic domains are identical in the two model peptides (if only because of the different length of the peptides), but it indicates that the essential properties of the hydrophobic domains are not fundamentally affected by the presence of cross-linking domains. Moreover, despite the small size of our aggregate, its liquid or melt-like behavior suggests that the present study captures the fundamental basis for ELP phase separation. See the new Results section titled “Relevance to elastin-like peptides with cross-linking domains” and our response to point 4 below.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>2) The significance of the results is not clear because important negative controls are missing.

Several computational studies have described structural ensembles of the more common type of IDPs. Among them, the RS peptide, which has a high net charge, was studied in detail using both simulations and experiments (Rauscher et al., JCTC 2015). Extensive computational studies of IDPs with varying fraction of charged residues have been carried out (Das and Pappu, 2013).</p><p>b) Unfolded or misfolded proteins are prone to form ordered amyloid aggregates, but, as we showed a decade ago, the amino acid composition of elastin is designed to avoid the amyloid fate (Rauscher et al., JCTC 2006). In that joint computational and experimental study with the Keeley lab, we showed that contrary to amyloidogenic peptides, self-assembled elastomeric proteins, including elastin and spider silks, remain hydrated and disordered even in the aggregated state. These properties are manifested in an apparent threshold in combined glycine and proline composition above which amyloid formation is impeded and elastomeric properties become apparent. High P and G content prevents the polypeptide backbone of self-assembled elastomeric proteins from adopting regular secondary structure required to form the water-excluding hydrophobic cores (in which the core is essentially completely dehydrated) found in globular proteins and in the core structure of amyloid fibrils—ensuring instead that the backbone is hydrated and disordered.</p><p>To clarify these points and provide more context on elastin as an aggregating/phase separating IDP, we have added a new section titled “Disordered aggregates: Structure and function of self-assembled elastomeric proteins” to the Results and Discussion, together with a new figure emphasizing the role of the hydrophobic effect and conformational disorder in protein folding, assembly, and elastic recoil (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7</xref>). In addition, we added analysis of the density profile of peptide and water in our system (subsection “Hydration and disorder of the polypeptide backbone”, last paragraph, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4</xref>), which shows that the peptides retain over 20% internal hydration in both monomeric and aggregated states.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>3) The choice of force field seems problematic, because it has been reported to favor overly compact structures in other systems. See e.g. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1</xref> in Piana et al., Curr. Opin. Struct. Biol. v24, p98, 2014, where the scaling of Rg with number of residues comes close to the one-third power, whereas most protein chains in water are closer to ideal chain scaling. Now elastin is quite hydrophobic, so it is possible that all is fine and it should be collapsed anyway, but it would be good to have some discussion of this issue and maybe a comparison with experiments which show that the elastin monomer behavior is reasonable.</p></disp-quote><p>We have modified the text to address and clarify the force field issue as explained below:</p><p>a) We cannot compare our results to experimental measurements performed on the same peptide, because to our knowledge such data are lacking for the (GVPGV)<sub>7</sub> monomer. However, our results are supported by NMR measurements performed on an elastin-like peptide containing hydrophobic domains with the same sequence. See our response to points (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib79">1</xref>) and (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib71">4</xref>) and revised text in the Results section titled “Relevance to elastin-like peptides with cross-linking domains”.</p><p>b) Our choice of the CHARMM22* and CHARMM-refined TIP3P force fields is directly motivated by Rauscher et al. (JCTC 2015), which shows that out of 8 combinations of protein and water force fields tested, this particular combination best reproduced experimental data on an intrinsically disordered peptide. See the first paragraph of the Materials and methods section titled “Choice of Force Field”.</p><p>c) We initially performed this study several years ago using a different force field combination (OPLS/AA with TIP3P) (Sarah Rauscher’s PhD thesis, 2012). This previous study led to significantly more compact estimates of the radius of gyration of the peptide monomer. As is now well appreciated, OPLS tends to overestimate the degree of collapse or compaction of unfolded or disordered states of proteins. Nevertheless, these results were qualitatively similar to those of the present study: disordered and hydrated peptides characterized by transient β-turns approached a melt-like state upon self-assembly. See the revised text in the last paragraph of the Materials and methods section titled “Choice of Force Field”.</p><p>d) In addition, to fully address the request to examine the dependence of our results, particularly as regards the size of the peptide monomer in water, on the choice of force field, we have repeated some of the simulations with a different force field combination. Specifically, we have performed 18 repeats of a 0.5-µs MD trajectory using CHARMM22* with TIP4P-D, a modified water force field with increased solvent-solute dispersion interactions recently proposed by Piana et al. (J. Phys. Chem. B, 2015) to improve the hydration of disordered protein ensembles. This new set of simulations leads to a less-collapsed (GVPGV)<sub>7</sub> monomer with size-scaling exponent 0.40, compared to the value of 0.28 obtained with the TIP3P model. We note that the TIP4P-D force field was observed to destabilize the native state of two folded proteins (Piana et al., 2015). As such, TIP4P-D may underestimate hydrophobic interactions in the hydrophobic IDP studied here. Nevertheless, the fact that the scaling exponent of our monomeric ELP obtained with TIP4P-D is still less than the ideal limit is consistent with hydrophobic collapse and the overall conclusions of the paper. The analysis of these new simulations is shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s2">Figure 1—figure supplement 2</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s4">Figure 2—figure supplement 4</xref>, and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5s3">Figure 5—figure supplement 3</xref>, and further discussion of force field dependence was added to the Materials and methods section (“Choice of force field”, last paragraph).</p><p>Together, points (c) and (d) indicate that our conclusions regarding the structural and physical basis for phase separation of hydrophobic elastin-like peptides are robust to the choice of force field, whether or not the compactness of the aqueous monomer is over- or underestimated.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>4) The comparison to experiment is rather weak and qualitative at best, and therefore should be strengthened. For instance, can the simulations be related quantitatively to the neutron scattering experiments in Perticaroli et al., 2015?

However, the results presented in this manuscript are in excellent agreement with an NMR study by Reichheld et al. (2017), which was published after this manuscript was submitted. The NMR study describes the structure and dynamics of block peptides with alternating cross-linking domains and hydrophobic domains with the same sequence as in the present study, successively in solution, in the coacervate, and in materials produced by cross-linking. The conformational ensemble of the hydrophobic domain presented in this study is consistent with the NMR results, both qualitatively and quantitatively. In particular, (i) the peptides are disordered both before and after phase separation; (ii) the secondary structure in the hydrophobic domains consists primarily of sparse and transient β turns in the VPGV and GVGV repeats, whose population was estimated to be in the range 20-40%, compared to our estimate of 16-20%; (iii) this secondary structure does not change significantly upon phase separation; (iv) phase separation entails formation of non-specific, intermolecular hydrophobic contacts; and (v) the protein-rich liquid phase is significantly hydrated.</p><p>This agreement corroborates the present results and indicates that the structural and physical basis for the self-assembly of hydrophobic domains is not fundamentally affected by the presence of cross-linking domains. We have added this experimental corroboration to the revised text (section “Relevance to elastin-like peptides with cross-linking domains”).</p></body></sub-article></article>
