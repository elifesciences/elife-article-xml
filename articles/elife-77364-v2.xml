Understanding the precise cellular connections through which this circuit is organised is, therefore, vital for understanding these same processes. Overturning earlier findings, a recent study described a novel excitatory projection from anterior cingulate area to dorsal hippocampus. We sought to validate this unexpected finding using multiple, complementary methods: anterograde and retrograde anatomical tracing, using anterograde and retrograde adeno-associated viral vectors, monosynaptic rabies tracing, and the Fast Blue classical tracer. Additionally, an extensive data search of the Allen Projection Brain Atlas database was conducted to find the stated projection within any of the deposited anatomical studies as an independent verification of our own results. However, we failed to find any evidence of a direct, monosynaptic glutamatergic projection from mouse anterior cingulate cortex to the hippocampus proper.</p></abstract><kwd-group kwd-group-type="author-keywords"><kwd>hippocampus</kwd><kwd>prefrontal cortex</kwd><kwd>anterior cingulate</kwd><kwd>neuroanatomy</kwd><kwd>viral tracing</kwd></kwd-group><kwd-group kwd-group-type="research-organism"><title>Research organism</title><kwd>Mouse</kwd></kwd-group><funding-group><award-group id="fund1"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100000268</institution-id><institution>Biotechnology and Biological Sciences Research Council</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>BB/P001475/1</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Craig</surname><given-names>Michael T</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund2"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100000265</institution-id><institution>Medical Research Council</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>MR/N0137941/1</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Margetts-Smith</surname><given-names>Gabriella</given-names></name><name><surname>Brady</surname><given-names>Erica S</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund3"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100004440</institution-id><institution>Wellcome Trust</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>108891/B/15/Z</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Yanakieva</surname><given-names>Steliana</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><funding-statement>The funders had no role in study design, data collection and interpretation, or the decision to submit the work for publication.

The subiculum and CA1 give rise to direct efferents that terminate in the prelimbic, infralimbic, and medial orbital cortices (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Cenquizca and Swanson, 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Groenewegen et al., 1987</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Jay and Witter, 1991</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">Swanson, 1981</xref>), as well as light projections to the anterior cingulate area (ACA; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Cenquizca and Swanson, 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Jay and Witter, 1991</xref>). In contrast, direct projections from the prefrontal cortex (including prelimbic and anterior cingulate cortices) have been extensively studied and prefrontal efferents to the Cornu Ammonis (CA) fields or the subiculum using classical tracers are not observed in rat (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Heidbreder and Groenewegen, 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Jones and Witter, 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Segal and Landis, 1974</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Sesack et al., 1989</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">Vertes, 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">Vogt and Miller, 1983</xref>). Meanwhile, only a very sparse projection from infralimbic cortex to CA1 has been described (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Hurley et al., 1991</xref>), Indeed, a comprehensive connectome was generated using an extensive, curated dataset from published anatomical literature in the rat and reported no evidence of an efferent projection from ACA or prelimbic cortex (PL) to the hippocampal CA subfields (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Bota et al., 2015</xref>). Similarly, no projection from any prefrontal region to hippocampus (HPC) is observed in marmosets (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Roberts et al., 2007</xref>). Relatively fewer studies using classical tracers to study efferent connections from mouse prefrontal cortex (PFC) have been carried out. However, it seems that mouse ACA projections correspond well with those seen in rat, with no prefrontal efferents being located in hippocampus proper (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Fillinger et al., 2018</xref>). For this reason, models of prefrontal regulatory action upon the hippocampus have emphasised the importance of indirect routes. These routes include relays via parahippocampal cortices and via subcortical sites, such as nucleus reuniens and the anterior thalamic nuclei (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Eichenbaum, 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Furtak et al., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Jones and Witter, 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Prasad and Chudasama, 2013</xref>).</p><p>This relationship was transformed by the description of light, direct projections from the dorsal ACA to the CA1 and CA3 fields in mice (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Rajasethupathy et al., 2015</xref>) using anterograde adeno-associated viral vector (AAV) and retrograde monosynaptic rabies approaches. Despite their sparsity, optogenetic manipulation of these same projections was sufficient to elicit contextual memory retrieval, and optogenetic stimulation of these axons evoked robust excitatory postsynaptic currents in pyramidal cells in both CA3 and CA1 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Rajasethupathy et al., 2015</xref>). These findings are striking, not least because by revealing a previously unknown connection in the rodent brain, they suggest that there are potentially many such functional connections still waiting to be uncovered. A second study, using retrograde AAVs, reported an incredibly sparse population of ACA neurons (1â3 neurons per section) that projected monosynaptically to both dorsal and ventral CA1 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Bian et al., 2019</xref>). However, other mouse studies using anterograde AAVs to map efferents from ACA report no projection to hippocampus (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Glat et al., 2022</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Shi et al., 2022</xref>). While not reported explicitly, representative images from another study mapping outputs of ACA revealed no labelling in hippocampus (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib44">Zhang et al., 2016</xref>). An inhibitory projection from prelimbic and infralimbic regions to hippocampus was recently described (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Malik et al., 2022</xref>); this projection was reported to selectively target inhibitory interneurons in hippocampus whilst avoiding pyramidal cells, which contrasts with excitatory ACA projection to hippocampal pyramidal cells that was reported in the first study (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Rajasethupathy et al., 2015</xref>).</p><p>Given the impact of their functional findings on anterior cingulate efferents (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Rajasethupathy et al., 2015</xref>), the present study re-examined the status of the projections from the ACA to the hippocampal formation (dentate gyrus [DG], CA fields, and subiculum [SUB]) in mice. Anterograde tracing using AAVs found no evidence of the anterior cingulate to hippocampus projection in mice, nor did rabies virus-assisted monosynaptic retrograde tracing from hippocampal pyramidal cells. Similarly, classical retrograde tracing using Fast Blue failed to reveal evidence of a direct projection from ACA to hippocampus. Furthermore, a thorough data mining analysis of Allen Expression data also revealed no evidence of an anterior cingulate to HPC projection in mice.</p></sec><sec id="s2" sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><sec id="s2-1"><title>Anterograde virus-assisted tracing</title><p>We carried out stereotaxic injections of AAV vectors to allow expression of GFP or mCherry in ACA neurons to allow us to map their projections (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1</xref>). We targeted our injections into ACA/PFC at two different AP levels: 1.0 mm rostral to Bregma (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1A</xref>) and 1.75 mm rostral to Bregma (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1B</xref>).

We then targeted the site deeper and slightly more lateral within a more rostral point in the rostrocaudal axis, which led to somatic labelling restricted entirely within the subdivisions of the prefrontal cortex (the green depictions of the viral spread in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1A</xref>). We further optimised the coordinates as described in the âMaterials and methodsâ section, and the resulting viral spread can be seen in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1B</xref>, showing more subregions of the prefrontal cortex, including infralimbic (IL), prelimic (PL), and anterior cingulate (ACC) cortices, have been successfully targeted with minimal spill into the neighbouring regions.

Importantly, however, we found no evidence of monosynaptic projections from ACA or any other prefrontal region to either dCA1 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2C, D and F</xref>) or vCA1 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2J, K, and M</xref>).

In the WT group, the median signal density in the ipsilateral CB was 0.031 and 0.0014 in the contralateral CB 0.014 (see <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3Ei</xref> for ranges). Similarly, the transgenic group with right-hemisphere injections had a median signal density in the ipsilateral CB of 0.0043 and 0.0002 in the contralateral CB (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3Ei</xref>). The presence of CB fibre label helps to confirm the effective transport of the tracer from the injection site. Lastly, there was no evidence of a projection from the ACA to the subiculum in any group as the median signal density observed for the ipsilateral and contralateral subiculum was a maximum of 0.0001 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3Eii</xref>).</p><p>The median density signal in the 16 transgenic cases with injection volumes of over 90% within the ACA was consistent with the data from the other 28 transgenic cases (see <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="fig1sdata1">Figure 1âsource data 1</xref>). The median group signal in both CA1 and CA3 was zero, with 10 cases having potential evidence of a signal (max = 0.0007) in CA1 and/or CA3. Again, Wilcoxon signed-rank tests revealed no evidence of a statistical difference in the signal between the ipsilateral or contralateral DG and CA3 or CA2 and CA3 (<italic>all z</italic> &lt; â1.63, <italic>all</italic> p<sub>s</sub> &gt; 0.102) nor between the ipsilateral and contralateral CA2 and CA1 (<italic>all z</italic> &lt; â1.34, <italic>all</italic> p<sub>s</sub> &gt; 0.180).

Further inspection of individual cases showed that one case (ID: 125801033) had noticeably higher signal density in the ipsilateral DG (0.0108) and SUB (0.0039). A second case (ID: 585911240) had the highest signal density in the ipsilateral CA3 (0.0007). However, in both cases 5% of the injection had leaked into adjacent fibre tracts.</p><p>Of concern was whether the adjacent cortical field M2 might project to the hippocampal formation and, thereby, be a potential confound for tracer injections that extended into this area.

Any case in which the tracer extended into the ACAs was excluded. The search returned only one such case (ID: 585025284), which showed no evidence of a projection to CA1, CA2, or subiculum (all signal density counts zero). There was a very low signal count within the ipsilateral CA3 and DG (&lt;0.0002). In an additional case (ID: 141602484), the viral injection involved both the primary motor cortex (46%) and area M2 (54%). The only hippocampal signal was in the ipsilateral CA3 (&lt;0.0002). Both cases had appreciably more signal in the ipsilateral than contralateral cingulum bundle, consistent with viable transport.</p></sec><sec id="s2-4"><title>Retrograde tracing using a single virus strategy</title><p>Thus far, we have failed to detect evidence of a direct projection from the cingulate area to hippocampus. The question remains of why there is a discrepancy between our data and that reported previously (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Rajasethupathy et al., 2015</xref>). In our rabies-virus assisted retrograde tracing experiment, we used a pseudotyped glycoprotein-deleted rabies virus that could only transduce neurons expressing the avian receptor protein, TVA, and could only spread transynaptically from glutamatergic neurons that also expressed the rabies glycoprotein, delivered via a secondary helper virus, as described elsewhere (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Sun et al., 2014</xref>). In contrast, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Rajasethupathy et al., 2015</xref> used a non-pseudotyped glycoprotein-deleted rabies virus which acts as a first-order tracer from the injection site (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib41">Wickersham et al., 2007</xref>). To test whether this strategy could provide off-target retrograde labelling, we made stereotaxic injections of a retrograde AAV vector (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">Tervo et al., 2016</xref>) into dorsal CA1 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4A</xref>). Using this approach, in addition to dense neuronal labelling of CA1 pyramidal cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4B</xref>), we saw labelling in the entorhinal cortex (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4I</xref>), as would be expected. However, similar to the extended Figure 1 of <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Rajasethupathy et al., 2015</xref>, we saw labelling of neurons directly above the injection site, and throughout both superficial and deep cortical layers in much of the brain (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4B</xref>; see also Extended Data Figure 1a of <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Rajasethupathy et al., 2015</xref>). Additionally, we observed dense labelling of neurons in the anterior thalamic nuclei (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4D</xref>), which do not project to hippocampus proper (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Mathiasen et al., 2020</xref>) and, importantly, we saw bilateral labelling in multiple subdivisions of prefrontal cortex, including the ACA (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4E, H and G</xref>); it was most dense in the ipsilateral hemisphere (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4E</xref>). We also observed fluorescent labelling in the claustrum (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4F</xref>), which should only project to cortical areas. Without the selectivity of the pseudotyped rabies-tracing approach from specific neuronal populations, we believe that the off-target retrograde labelling in this region was due to uptake of virus in axons passing through the cingulum and/or corpus callosum as well as along the path of the injection needle.</p><fig id="fig4" position="float"><label>Figure 4.</label><caption><title>Retrograde tracing from dCA1 shows non-specific expression in multiple brain area, including both ipsi- and contralateral anterior cingulate and prelimbic areas.</title><p>(<bold>A</bold>) Outline of experimental method.

In the total of 11 injections with 3% dilution of the dye, 4 brains displayed substantial uptake by neurons in the hippocampus while only limited spillage of the dye into the overlaying cortex was observed. These brains were added to the experimental total. One mouse was excluded as few fluorescent cells were present in the injection site, most likely due to partial blockage of the Hamilton needle during the injection. Several mice showed the spread of the injection site beyond the hippocampus into surrounding areas, including the dorsal subiculum and somatosensory cortex; in these animals, we saw a high prevalence of fluorescent cells across throughout the cortex, in different subregions of the prefrontal cortices, from infralimbic to anterior cingulate cortices, as well as thalamic nuclei. The example of such spread can be found in supplementary material (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5s1">Figure 5âfigure supplement 1</xref>). In the four good injections, where the dye was restricted primarily to the dorsal CA1 region of the hippocampus (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5B</xref>) and only some cells were labelled along the travel path of the needle, there were no labelled cells present in the prefrontal cortices, including ACC, PL, and IL subregions regions (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5C and D</xref>). However, other regions, known to project to dorsal CA1, such as medial septum, dorsal subiculum, and entorhinal cortex all showed dye-filled cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5F, G and E</xref>, respectively).

Importantly, both our retrograde and anterograde-tracing experiments revealed the existence of expected efferent projections from ACA and afferent inputs to hippocampus. For example, our anterograde AAV tracing from ACA revealed projections to midline thalamic regions, retrosplenial cortex, claustrum, and striatum, in agreement with classical tracing experiments from rat (summarised by <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Bota et al., 2015</xref>), mouse (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Fillinger et al., 2018</xref>), and primate (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Roberts et al., 2007</xref>). Similarly, our monosynaptic rabies-tracing experiments found inputs to hippocampus from regions such as medial septum and entorhinal cortex, in agreement with a broad wealth of literature (reviewed by, e.g. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib42">Witter et al., 1989</xref>). We have presented wide-field images from all of our tracing experiments to confirm the specificity of the projections being described. In cases where experiments do not work as planned due to a lack of specificity of the tracer, the presentation of wide-field images makes this immediately apparent and urges caution when interpreting the results. We would recommend that, when describing a novel neural projection, authors also include control data to reassure readers that known projections are also present but without widespread non-specific labelling.</p><sec id="s3-1"><title>Retrograde tracing from hippocampus</title><p>We employed an intersectional approach with rabies viruses using an EnvA-pseudotyped rabies virus combined with TVA expression restricted to hippocampal pyramidal cells via the <italic>Emx1</italic> promoter. As a result, this reduced our density of starter cells, so the possibility remains that some sparse projections would be missed, or those that specifically target inhibitory interneurons such as the inhibitory prefrontal projection reported by <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Malik et al., 2022</xref>. However, we complemented our dataset with the classical tracer, Fast Blue, the results of which supported our viral tracing findings. It should be noted that the Fast Blue experiments did not retrogradely label any neurons in PL or IL. The postsynaptic targets of the reported inhibitory projection neurons in PFC primarily target deeper layers within CA1 and, as can be seen from <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5A</xref>, our Fast Blue injections primarily hit <italic>stratum oriens</italic> and <italic>stratum pyramidale</italic>, potentially explaining why we did not observe an inhibitory projection.</p><p>Despite these caveats associated with our present study, we believe that this approach substantially reduces the risk of observing false positives. In contrast, the study using an un-pseudotyped rabies virus (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Rajasethupathy et al., 2015</xref>) displayed examples of what appears to be off-target expression in a number of brain regions, such as in the secondary motor cortex, retrosplenial cortex, and possibly somatosensory cortex. Notably, specific transduction of corpus callosum oligodendrocyte precursor cells with rabies virus reveals that these cells receive widespread presynaptic input from PFC, motor cortex, and somatosensory cortex (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Mount et al., 2019</xref>). Indeed, the distribution of presynaptic somata shown in figures 1 and 2 of the Mount study bears a striking resemblance to that shown in <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Rajasethupathy et al., 2015</xref>. By using a rabies virus able to transduce any neural cell, the possibility exists that at least some of the retrogradely labelled neurons were due to off-target transduction of oligodendrocyte precursor cells overlying the hippocampal injection site.</p><p>The retrograde tracing from the Bian (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Bian et al., 2019</xref>) produced far more sparse labelling than that reported by <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Rajasethupathy et al., 2015</xref>. This later study used a retrograde AAV strategy that, from the figures shown, produced a sparse labelling of neurons in ACA and secondary motor cortex, with only two or three somata present per brain region. The titre of retroAAV used in the study was not stated but the injection volume was 400 nl in ACA and 600 nl in hippocampus; the low density of neurons transduced in the injection sites (e.g. figure 5A) is surprising (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Bian et al., 2019</xref>). This study also failed to detect the vHPC to ACA projection that has been described in classical tracer studies (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Cenquizca and Swanson, 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Hoover and Vertes, 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Jay and Witter, 1991</xref>). It should be noted that at least one study of ventral hippocampal projections to PFC found preferential targeting of prelimbic and infralimbic regions over ACA (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">Spellman et al., 2015</xref>), although this later study was carried out in rostral PFC, and the hippocampal axon termination patterns shown correspond to those with classical tracer studies (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Cenquizca and Swanson, 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Hoover and Vertes, 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Jay and Witter, 1991</xref>).

In contrast to the data reported by <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Rajasethupathy et al., 2015</xref>, we did not observe any ACA axons in HPC, which is in agreement with other subsequent anterograde-tracing studies using the same approach (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Fillinger et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib40">Wang and Ikemoto, 2016</xref>). A more recent study employed the fMOST technique to map the whole-brain projectome of individual neurons from different prefrontal areas, mapping the complete axonal arborisation of 6357 glutamatergic neurons in PFC, and clustering these into 64 specific subtypes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Gao et al., 2022</xref>). The dataset from this study is available online (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://mouse.braindatacenter.cn/">https://mouse.braindatacenter.cn/</ext-link>), and we searched the dataset for PFC neurons with at least two axon termination points in CA hippocampal subfields; criteria recommended by the authors. Of the 6357 neurons, we found only four PFC neurons that had terminations in the hippocampus, and only three of which had terminations in dHPC (see <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s1">Figure 3âfigure supplement 1</xref>). It should be noted that none of these prefrontal HPC-projecting neurons were located in ACA, with somata located in lateral orbitofrontal cortex (layer 2/3; two neurons), anterior secondary motor cortex (layer 5; one neuron), and ventral agranular insular cortex (one neuron; layer 2/3) with most terminations near the hippocampus located just dorsal of the CA subfields. Despite tracing the complete projectome of over 6000 PFC neurons, the study by <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Gao et al., 2022</xref> did not provide any evidence to support the existence of a direct ACA to HPC glutamatergic projection.</p><p>We are unable to provide an explanation for the discrepancy between the findings of <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Rajasethupathy et al., 2015</xref> and those from our and other research groups. The injection spread of their anterograde-tracing experiment, shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1b</xref> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Rajasethupathy et al., 2015</xref>) clearly includes the cingulate area, but also the M2 part of motor cortex is transduced by the virus; it is also possible that the transitional midcingulate area 24â (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">Vogt and Paxinos, 2014</xref>) has been targeted. Indeed, when using the reported coordinates, we again found significant spread of the virus in M2. Furthermore, looking at the projection pattern of the anterograde fibres in <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Rajasethupathy et al., 2015</xref>, it can be noticed that both hippocampi show fluorescent fibres, with the fibres in the contralateral hippocampus (right; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1b</xref> in their study) being brighter than in the ipsilateral hippocampus; the pattern, opposite to that in the case of the thalamus. Having used 250 nl of virus, compared with 500 nl from <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Rajasethupathy et al., 2015</xref> we still observe the spillover into neighbouring brain areas with these coordinates. Whilst the spillover of the virus itself cannot account for the apparent presence of axons from the cingulate area to CA1, nor the optogenetic activation of these afferents in that study, one potential explanation of a false positive could be that the relatively large volume of virus with a high titre injected close to the midline led to the leakage of virus beyond the intended injection site, resulting virus being taken up via axons traversing the cingulum bundle.</p><p>Should there exist a direct projection from ACA to HPC that our group and others have failed to detect, one possible explanation could be a difference in the tropism of viral vectors used to transduce neurons, with the ACA to HPC-projecting neurons uniquely resistant to transduction by vectors that are able to target other neurons within the same brain region. Another explanation could be the incubation time for viral expression from the time of injection to perfusing the animals, with our study using (at least) 3 wk, compared to the 30-day (anatomical tracing) or 6â8-week (optogenetics) incubation used by <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Rajasethupathy et al., 2015</xref>. However, strong AAV-driven gene expression in vivo is typically seen after 2â3 wk (e.g. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Aschauer et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">Stoica et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib43">Xu et al., 2001</xref>), and the fMOST PFC projectome study used 4-week incubation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Gao et al., 2022</xref>). Intuitively, it seems unlikely that the fMOST study would reveal PFC axonal projections that are distributed across the entire brain after 4 wk, while selectively sparing the labelling of axons that enter HPC. And these viral tropism/incubation hypotheses cannot account for why any ACA to PFC projection had remained undetected using classical tracer methods.</p></sec><sec id="s3-3"><title>Concluding remarks</title><p>Here we report that we have been unable to find evidence of a monosynaptic glutamatergic projection from ACA to hippocampus proper in the mouse, replicating findings reported over decades of rodent neuroanatomical literature but in stark contrast to two recent reports (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Bian et al., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Rajasethupathy et al., 2015</xref>).

The hippocampalâprefrontal system is perhaps one of the most widely studied long-range circuits in cognitive neuroscience; that controversies still exist on the precise cellular connections between these two areas serves to highlight both the excitement and challenges that arise as modern genetic tools provide us with opportunities to study neural circuitry in detail that was unimaginable just 20 years ago.</p></sec></sec><sec id="s4" sec-type="materials|methods"><title>Materials and methods</title><p>All UK-based research was carried out in accordance with the UK Animals (Scientific Procedures) Act 1986 and was subject to local ethical review by the Animal Welfare and Ethical Review Board at the University of Exeter or University of Glasgow. All animals were maintained on a 12 hr constant light/dark cycle and had access to food and water ad libitum. We used standard enrichment that included cardboard tubes, wooden chew blocks and nesting material.</p><sec id="s4-1"><title>Stereotaxic coordinates and the borders of anterior cingulate area</title><p>Prefrontal cortex has been extensively studied in multiple model organisms, from mice and rats to humans and nonhuman primates. However, despite a large amount of homology across species, the shape of the prefrontal areas in the brains of different species is quite varied. These variations in shape, together with distinctions in the cytoarchitecture of the subdivisions of the prefrontal cortex, have led to a lack of agreed nomenclature and clear boundaries of specific prefrontal regions (see <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Laubach et al., 2018</xref> for a comprehensive analysis of discrepancies between authors). In this article, we use the nomenclature and delineation from <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">Vogt and Paxinos, 2014</xref> and the human homologies (Brodmannâs areas). A very helpful online unified anatomical atlas, combining the Franklin-Paxinos and the common coordinate framework from the Allen Institute of Brain Science, was also used cross-check the anatomical borders of the prefrontal areas (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Chon et al., 2019</xref>).</p></sec><sec id="s4-2"><title>AAV anterograde and retrograde tracing</title><p>This tracing study used adult C57BL/6 (Envigo, UK) or <italic>Sst-cre</italic> (Jackson Laboratories, USA; stock number 018973) mice of both sexes aged 2â5 mo, ranging from 22.2 g to 31.3 g (mean age 3 mo, mean weight 25 g). To target the ACA, we made stereotaxic injections of 250 nl of AAV5-CamKII-GFP 5.3 Ã 10<sup>12</sup> vg/ml (Viral Vector Facility, Neuroscience Centre Zurich, Switzerland) or AAV5/2-hSyn1-ChR2_mCherry 7.1 Ã 10<sup>12</sup> vg/ml (Viral Vector Facility, Neuroscience Centre Zurich). Briefly, mice were anaesthetised with 5% isoflurane, were placed on a heated pad for the duration of the surgery, and maintained at 1.5â2.5% isoflurane (with a flow rate of ~2 l min<sup>â1</sup> O<sub>2</sub>). Mice were given 0.1 mg/kg of buprenorphine (buprenorphine hydrochloride, Henry Schein) subcutaneously at the start of surgery as an adjunct analgesic, and carprofen (Rimadyl, Henry Schein) was given at a dose of 5 mg/kg subcutaneously at the end of surgery and on subsequent days, as required. An incision was made down the midline, and a craniotomy was performed to allow injection of virus (250 nl). For anterograde tracing, we first used the coordinates reported by <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Rajasethupathy et al., 2015</xref>: A/P +1.0 mm (relative to Bregma), M/L â0.35 mm, and D/V-1.2 mm (from pia). Additionally, to minimise spread of virus into M2 cortical area, we also injected at A/P +1 mm (relative to Bregma), M/L â0.2 mm, and D/V-1.3 mm (from pia) on the same rostrocaudal plane, and targeted ACA at a more rostral site A/P +1.75 mm (relative to Bregma), M/L â0.2 mm, and D/V â1.5 mm (from pia). For retrograde tracing with AAVs, we used rAAV-retro, developed at HHMI Janelia Campus (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">Tervo et al., 2016</xref>), and injected rAAV-retro/2-CAG-EGFP_Cre-WPRE-SV40p(A) 5.9 Ã 10<sup>12</sup> vg/ml (Viral Vector Facility, Neuroscience Centre Zurich) into hippocampal region CA1 using the following co-ordinates: A/P â2 mm (relative to Bregma), M/L â1.5 mm, and D/V â1.35 mm (from pia). After surgical repair of the wound, mice were given 5 mg/kg carprofen (Rimadyl, Henry Schein) subcutaneously immediately after surgery and again the following day. Further analgesia was provided as required. The mice were maintained for at least 3 wk to provide sufficient time for expression of virally delivered transgenes and were killed by transcardial perfusion/fixation with 4% paraformaldehyde (Sigma-Aldrich, UK) in 0.1 M phosphate buffer.</p><p>Perfused brains were cryoprotected with 30% sucrose solution (Fisher Scientific, UK) and sliced at 30 Âµm using a SM2010R freezing microtome (Leica, UK). The slices were stained with DAPI (HelloBio, UK), and images were taken on SLM710 confocal microscope (Zeiss). For anterograde tracing experiments, 32 mice were injected (two were excluded due to failed injections as no fluorescence was observed) and 10 mice were injected with a retrograde virus (two mice were excluded due to failed injections). Viral expression patterns of anterograde viral vectors in individual mice at the injection sites of both sets of coordinates were overlaid (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1A and B</xref>) to show the variation in the injections and typical spread of the virus in the injection areas.

Adult <italic>Emx1-cre</italic> mice (Jackson Laboratories; stock number 005628) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Guo et al., 2000</xref>) were crossed with floxed TVA mice (kindly provided by Prof Dieter Saur, Technical University of Munich) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Seidler et al., 2008</xref>) to allow specific targeting of pyramidal cells; <italic>Emx1-cre</italic> mice alone were used as controls to ensure the rabies viruses did not transduce neurons in the absence of TVA gene. We used mice of both sexes aged 3â7 mo, ranging from 21.7 g to 40.6 g (mean age 4.5 mo, mean weight 27.2 g). To target the efferent projections to dCA1, we made stereotaxic injections of AAV8-FLEX-H2B-GFP-2A-oG, titre 3.93 Ã 10<sup>12</sup> vg/ml (Salk Institute Viral Vector Core) followed by injection EnvA G-deleted Rabies-mCherry 6.13 Ã 10<sup>8</sup> vg/ml (Salk Institute Viral Vector Core or CharitÃ©-UniversitÃ¤tsmedizin Berlin Viral Vector Core) 2 wk after the initial viral injection. Briefly, mice were anaesthetised with 5% isoflurane, were placed on a heated pad for the duration of the surgery, and maintained at 1.5â2.5% isoflurane (with a flow rate of ~2 l min<sup>â1</sup> O<sub>2</sub>).

An incision was made down the midline and a craniotomy performed to allow injection of virus (250 nl). We targeted hippocampal region CA1 at dorsal and ventral points using the following coordinates: A/P â2 mm (relative to Bregma), M/L â1.5 mm, and D/V â1.35 mm (from pia) and A/P â2.8 mm (relative to Bregma), M/L â2.4 mm, and D/V â4.2 mm (from pia) for dorsal and ventral CA1 regions, respectively. After surgical repair of the wound, mice were given 5 mg/kg carprofen (Rimadyl, Henry Schein) subcutaneously immediately after surgery and again the following day. Further analgesia was provided as required. The mice were maintained for 2 wk to provide optimal time for expression and were killed by transcardial perfusion/fixation with 4% paraformaldehyde (Cat# P6148, Sigma-Aldrich, UK) in 0.1 M phosphate buffer.</p><p>Perfused brains were cryoprotected with 30% sucrose solution (Fisher Scientific) and sliced at 50 Âµm using a SM2010R freezing microtome (Leica). The slices were mounted using HardSet Mounting Medium with DAPI (Vector Labs) and images were taken on SLM710 confocal microscope (Zeiss). A total of 18 mice including four controls were injected (two were excluded due to failed injections as no fluorescence from both viral constructs was observed). Representative images of the spread of the viruses can be found in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2</xref>. A semi-quantitative assessment of the projection patterns was performed by recording the number of slices with the cells expressing the virus in each region of interest present and the summary of this data is shown (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2P</xref>). Estimated number of starter cells per mouse was calculated by extrapolating the number of starter cells per section onto estimated viral spread (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s1">Figure 2âfigure supplement 1</xref>). These monosynaptic rabies tracing data were generated in the same experiment that we have reported elsewhere, focusing on connections between nucleus reuniens and CA1 pyramidal cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Andrianova et al., 2021</xref>).</p></sec><sec id="s4-4"><title>Fast Blue dye retrograde tracing</title><p>For classical retrograde tracing, we used Fast Blue dye (3 or 0.6% dilution), as described previously (Yanakieva 2022). Mice of both sexes aged between 4 and 9 months old, ranged from 23.8 g to 36.8 g (mean age 6.2 mo and mean weight 30.4 g). We used coordinates described above to target dCA1. Fast Blue dye (Polysciences, CAS# 73819-41-7) was diluted to 3 or 0.6% working solution using sterile saline and 300 nl were injected into dCA1. Stereotaxic surgery was done as above, and mice were allowed to recover for 7 d before a transcardial perfusion was performed as described above. Cryoprotected brains were sliced at 50-micron thickness on the freezing microtome and visualised using the LSM710 confocal microscope (Zeiss). A total of 15 mice were used and 3 were excluded due to failed injection and a further 5 were excluded due to spill over of dye into overlaying structures.

To create the atlas, each mouse brain is injected with enhanced green fluorescent protein (EGFP) expressing AAV as an anterograde tracer into a <italic>source</italic> brain region (for further details, see <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://connectivty.brain-mpa.org">http://connectivty.brain-mpa.org</ext-link>). Then, the axonal projections are systematically imaged using a TisseCyte 1000 serial two-photon tomography system. The data in the atlas were collected from adult mice on postnatal day P56 Â± 2 (for details, see <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Oh et al., 2014</xref>). Each case in the atlas contains high-resolution images and quantified projection information based on the optical density of label. Detailed histograms of the signal in each structure are presented giving the projection volume (mm<sup>3</sup>) and projection density (the fraction of area occupied by a fluorescent signal from the viral construct used relative to the whole structure). Details of the algorithms used are provided (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Kuan et al., 2015</xref>). The sensitivity of this viral tracer has been compared with biotinylated dextran amine (BDA). These comparisons revealed that the AAV was at least as efficient as and more specific than BDA (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://connectivty.brain-mpa.org">http://connectivty.brain-mpa.org</ext-link>).</p><p>To establish whether there are direct projections from the ACA (dorsal ACA and ventral ACA) to the hippocampal formation (CA 1â3, DG, and SUB), a comprehensive systematic search was completed. In addition, the density of fibre label in the cingulum bundle (CB) was taken from the Allen Atlas. The dorsal and ventral ACA were entered as a <italic>source structure</italic> and the CA1-3, DG, SUB, and cingulum bundle as target structures. The search was further filtered for (1) reporter type: EGFP; (2) hemisphere: either; (3) minimum target injection volume: 0.0001 mm<sup>3</sup>. A total of 99 cases were returned. Then, 63 cases with injection volumes of 0.02â0.3 mm<sup>3</sup> in the ACA were selected for further processing, of which 47 had a minimum of 90% of the injected virus (mean = 0.108 mm<sup>3</sup>; SD = 0.059 mm<sup>3</sup>) within the dorsal and ventral ACAs. <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="fig3sdata1">Figure 3âsource data 1</xref> lists all 47 cases and provides further information about the transgenic lines and the individual injections. The large majority (n = 44) of the injections were made in the right hemisphere, the remaining three in the left. In the few cases where some signal was reported in areas CA1 and CA3, we used the Wilcoxon signed-rank test to compare that signal with the corresponding signal in the ipsilateral DG and CA2 to help test for background variation. (The DG and CA2 were selected as there are no reports of ACA inputs to these subareas.)</p><p>There were three cases of wild-type mice (C57BL/6J) with 100% of the injection volume within ACA. Of the 44 transgenic mice, 28 had 100% of the tracer within the ACA, making a total of 31 such cases. The other 16 cases had a minimum of 90% of the tracer in the ACA and the remainder in adjacent areas, including the secondary motor area, the prelimbic cortex, and adjacent fibre tracts in various proportions. These 16 cases were, therefore, not considered in the initial analyses. In the WT group all mice were male, whilst in the transgenic group of 28 cases with 100% of the injection in the ACA, 12 were female. In the same transgenic group, 27 of the 28 injections were in the right hemisphere (see <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="fig3sdata1">Figure 3âsource data 1</xref> for a list of included studies).</p></sec></sec></body><back><sec sec-type="additional-information" id="s5"><title>Additional information</title><fn-group content-type="competing-interest"><title>Competing interests</title><fn fn-type="COI-statement" id="conf1"><p>No competing interests declared</p></fn></fn-group><fn-group content-type="author-contribution"><title>Author contributions</title><fn fn-type="con" id="con1"><p>Formal analysis, Investigation, Visualization, Methodology, Writing â original draft, Project administration, Writing â review and editing</p></fn><fn fn-type="con" id="con2"><p>Formal analysis, Funding acquisition, Investigation, Visualization, Methodology, Writing â original draft, Writing â review and editing</p></fn><fn fn-type="con" id="con3"><p>Funding acquisition, Investigation, Writing â review and editing</p></fn><fn fn-type="con" id="con4"><p>Investigation, Writing â review and editing</p></fn><fn fn-type="con" id="con5"><p>Funding acquisition, Investigation, Writing â review and editing</p></fn><fn fn-type="con" id="con6"><p>Conceptualization, Supervision, Funding acquisition, Writing â original draft, Writing â review and editing</p></fn><fn fn-type="con" id="con7"><p>Conceptualization, Data curation, Formal analysis, Supervision, Funding acquisition, Investigation, Methodology, Writing â original draft, Project administration, Writing â review and editing</p></fn></fn-group><fn-group content-type="ethics-information"><title>Ethics</title><fn fn-type="other"><p>All UK-based research was carried out in accordance with the UK Animals (Scientific Procedures) Act 1986, and was subject to local ethical review by the Animal Welfare and Ethical Review Board at the University of Exeter or University of Glasgow.

Your article has been reviewed by 3 peer reviewers, including Mathieu Wolff as Reviewing Editor and Reviewer #1, and the evaluation has been overseen by Laura Colgin as the Senior Editor. The following individual involved in review of your submission has agreed to reveal their identity: Thomas Van Groen (Reviewer #3).</p><p>The reviewers have discussed their reviews with one another, and the Reviewing Editor has drafted this to help you prepare a revised submission.</p><p>Essential revisions:</p><p>1) There is a need to consolidate the retrograde tracing approach. Only a few starter cells were reported with the pseudo-rabies approach while the retrograde AAV used was found to produce off-target labeling, so there is a risk that the entire retrograde approach is not fully compelling. Further analyses (e.g. some quantitative analysis of the number of starter cells) and comments are needed. Relying on more classic retrograde tracers is also an option.</p><p>2) Given the nature of the work, all figures must be considerably improved. Higher magnification is needed in many cases and figure captions need to be more comprehensive (see reviewers 1 and 2 for details). Perhaps more illustrations are needed to build stronger cases since that is the only material for the reader to appreciate the current work.</p><p>3) The text needs to be more comprehensively expanded. The Results section in particular needs a serious overhaul, to provide much more information on the anatomical data and to compare that with those already reported in the literature (see ref 2 in particular). As a result it is expected that the discussion would also be more thorough, to discuss with greater detail the neuroanatomy and better take into account the limits of the current study (partially depending on how point 1/ is handled). Overall all referee agreed this is an important paper but to have the right impact it needs to be much better presented.</p><p>Please refer to individual reviews below for more details.</p><p><italic>Reviewer #1 (Recommendations for the authors):</italic></p><p>I would also suggest to enhance the quality of the figures if possible. These are the only material to consider here and I often found it hard to see the actual labeling, perhaps a higher magnification could help in some cases (Figures 2C/2J) for starter cells; in general, all figures supposed to show labelled cells bodies for retrograde approaches. The meaning of green versus red labeling in figure 2 needs to be explained so that a non-specialist can understand it. Drawing of thalamic nuclei in figure 1D seem a bit arbitrary (Figure 1F seems much more accurate).</p><p><italic>Reviewer #2 (Recommendations for the authors):</italic></p><p>The authors examined the connections of the anterior cingulate cortex (ACA) with the dorsal and ventral hippocampus (CA fields and subiculum) using viral vector techniques in mice and further analyzed data from the Allen Brain Atlas examining these connections. The main intent of the manuscript was to determine the presence or absence of direct ACA-hippocampal projections in light of a previous influential report (Rajasethupath et al., 2015) showing such projections.</p><p>1. There has been a growing body of evidence/support for the notion that the hippocampus (HP) projects directly to the medial prefrontal cortex (mPFC), but there are no &quot;direct&quot; return from the mPFC to the HP, and thus mPFC actions on the HP are mediated by intervening structures, mainly by the nucleus reuniens. In possible contrast to this, a recent report by Rajasethupath et al. (2015) described direct projections from the ACA to CA1/CA3 of the HP in mice â with important functional implications. As the authors rightfully point out, if this direct connection was accepted, it could possibly initiate the search for other (misleading) cortical connections to the HP (among other things). Accordingly, the present manuscript serves the very valuable function of disputing a direct ACA input to the hippocampus.</p><p>2. A major issue, however, is that this is &quot;all&quot; the manuscript does; that is, it does not provide any additional (or new) information on the projections of the ACA or inputs to the hippocampus â which presumably it could have. In addition, they should have built a stronger case from the existing literature showing a lack of projections from all areas of the mPFC, including ACA, to the hippocampus (see, Heidbreder and Groenewegen, 2003; Vertes, 2004). Although some of this was done in the Discussion, they should expand on this, possibly incorporating it into the Introduction.</p><p>3. The figures are generally poor â could be much improved. See below. In the first instance, the labeling (abbreviations) on the figures (and subpanels) is much too small to discern at print size. They need to be enlarged.</p><p>Figure 1. Fig, 1A,B: are the graded blue and green scales (lower) meant to show separate injections, this can't be seen on the cortical sections (A and B)? The actual injection shown in Figure 1A (to the right) is quite large and encompasses a significant part of M2 at this level. They should include a sample injection restricted to ACA. There are no micrographs in Figure 1 showing the ventral hippocampus; this should be included. The thalamic labeling with the ACA injections (Figure 1 D,F) is not typical of ACA-thalamic projections. And what are the thalamic nuclei that were labeled with the ACA injections (Figure 1 D,E); this needs to be described in the figure legend and text of the Results. Figure 1H needs to be improved; it is not clear what is being shown -- diagonal band or lateral septal labeling?</p><p>Figure 2. It was indicated that the counts of the retrogradely labeled cells were done semi-quantitatively, this needs to be described in greater detail. The started cells (with arrows) of the dorsal and ventral HP need to be shown at higher magnification â even higher than shown in Figure 2J. And very importantly, it seems that the technique only labeled a small percentage of CA1 neurons (judging by the arrows) and if so, this could account relative paucity of retrogradely labeled cells in the structures afferent to the hippocampus, such as the medial septum (Figure 2N). The medial septum should be filled with cells. But this could also account for the lack of labeled cells in ACA (few started cells in CA1), or at least this needs to be addressed. Perhaps the nucleus reuniens should be included as a major afferent to HP. Finally, it is critical to show retrogradely labeled cells at higher magnification, at present all that can be seen are red areas, no individual cells can be distinguished. Lastly, is the PFC in Figure 2P meant to represent the entire prefrontal cortex or the ACA?</p><p>Figure 3. When they indicate that the ACA injections from the Allen atlas where 100% or 90% contained within ACA, was this their estimate and if so how was this done. I assume that the density values are from the atlas, but how do they interpret the very low densities (i.e., in CA1, Sub or DG) when they are not zero? Although possibly for present purposes the Allen atlas may be sufficient, it is not comprehensive â as can be judged by the subcortical labeling profiles shown in Figure 3A-C. And the statement that the viral tracing of the Allen atlas is comparable to the transport properties of BDA is not reassuring in that BDA is a poor anterograde tracer.</p><p>Figure 4. Very poor, can't see the retrograde cell labeling in cortical or subcortical structures. Like Figure 2 labeled cells need to be shown at high magnification.</p><p>4. The description (text) of their anterograde and retrograde tracing experiments in the Results needs to be expanded, only two relatively short paragraphs are devoted to each (anterograde and retrograde experiments) â and much less than the two and half pages devoted to the findings with Allen atlas. For instance, for the anterograde tracing only one sentence was devoted to describing their results (p. 9), essentially only stating that they observed ACA projections to the &quot;retrosplenial cortex and several thalamic nuclei&quot; but no labeling in the hippocampus. The text of the Results should describe the data of Figure 1, panel by panel. The same for the retrograde experiment.</p><p>5. The Discussion was rather incomplete. They should provide a more thorough summary of their findings at the outset of the Discussion. While, as they indicate, the Rajasethupath et al. (2015) study is very influential and hence the need to devote considerable attention to it, the Bian et al. (2019) study probably deserves to be discussed in greater detail. For instance, it was only described in the Discussion and not throughout the manuscript; perhaps it should be mentioned in the Introduction. Additionally, it was not well described in the Discussion. The section entitled &quot;Stereotaxic coordinates and the borders of the anterior cingulate cortex&quot; is out of place and not relevant to the Discussion. Some of this could be included in the Introduction or Methods, that is, ACA nomenclature and coordinates. The Discussion should put a greater emphasis on their overall findings â not just the lack of ACA connections with the hippocampus but importantly their verification of other (typical) ACA outputs or HP inputs. Seemingly, this was not done in the Rajasethupath et al. or Bian et al. studies and should have been.</p></body></sub-article><sub-article article-type="reply" id="sa2"><front-stub><article-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.77364.sa2</article-id><title-group><article-title>Author response</article-title></title-group></front-stub><body><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Essential revisions:</p><p>1) There is a need to consolidate the retrograde tracing approach.

Overall all referee agreed this is an important paper but to have the right impact it needs to be much better presented.</p></disp-quote><p>We have vastly expanded the descriptive portion of our Results sections to relate our findings to those already known in the literature.</p><p>We have also thoroughly expanded the discussion to consider both retrograde and anterograde tracing in wider detail, discuss limitations of our own study and to more thoroughly discuss surrounding literature and potential caveats of viral tracing.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Please refer to individual reviews below for more details.</p><p>Reviewer #1 (Recommendations for the authors):</p><p>I would also suggest to enhance the quality of the figures if possible. These are the only material to consider here and I often found it hard to see the actual labeling, perhaps a higher magnification could help in some cases (Figures 2C/2J) for starter cells; in general, all figures supposed to show labelled cells bodies for retrograde approaches. The meaning of green versus red labeling in figure 2 needs to be explained so that a non-specialist can understand it.

The main intent of the manuscript was to determine the presence or absence of direct ACA-hippocampal projections in light of a previous influential report (Rajasethupath et al., 2015) showing such projections.</p><p>Comments (in no particular order).</p><p>3. The figures are generally poor â could be much improved. See below. In the first instance, the labeling (abbreviations) on the figures (and subpanels) is much too small to discern at print size. They need to be enlarged.</p><p>Figure 1. Fig, 1A,B: are the graded blue and green scales (lower) meant to show separate injections, this can't be seen on the cortical sections (A and B)? The actual injection shown in Figure 1A (to the right) is quite large and encompasses a significant part of M2 at this level. They should include a sample injection restricted to ACA. There are no micrographs in Figure 1 showing the ventral hippocampus; this should be included. The thalamic labeling with the ACA injections (Figure 1 D,F) is not typical of ACA-thalamic projections. And what are the thalamic nuclei that were labeled with the ACA injections (Figure 1 D,E); this needs to be described in the figure legend and text of the Results. Figure 1H needs to be improved; it is not clear what is being shown -- diagonal band or lateral septal labeling?</p></disp-quote><p>Figure 1A and 1B show cartoon overlays of blue and green injection spreads, with increasing âstrengthâ of colour indicating the number of animals that had fluorophore expression in a particular region. This allows us to present a summary of injection sites across a larger number of animals than can be shown. We have described this more explicitly in the text to aid the reader. Whereas the representative examples show only one injection spread, as they are images of brain tissue.</p><p>Figure 1A shows injection sites that spread into M2 as these correspond to the injections made by the paper that we were trying to replicate, thus it was essential to include in the manuscript. Figure 1B, by contrast, presents more optimised injections that were restricted to prefrontal areas. The most important point is that, even when virus spreads beyond ACA to regions such as M2, we still see no efferent axons in hippocampus (HPC).</p><p>We have made sure that all of the abbreviations are now included in the figure legend.</p><p>We have not included images of ventral hippocampus (vHPC) as no claims were made about ACA to vHPC in the original paper that we tried to replicate and, while our rabies tracing shows no input from vHPC from ACA, we have omitted showing the vHPC images in this figure to aid clarity and prevent the figure becoming too crowded.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Figure 2. It was indicated that the counts of the retrogradely labeled cells were done semi-quantitatively, this needs to be described in greater detail. The started cells (with arrows) of the dorsal and ventral HP need to be shown at higher magnification â even higher than shown in Figure 2J. And very importantly, it seems that the technique only labeled a small percentage of CA1 neurons (judging by the arrows) and if so, this could account relative paucity of retrogradely labeled cells in the structures afferent to the hippocampus, such as the medial septum (Figure 2N). The medial septum should be filled with cells. But this could also account for the lack of labeled cells in ACA (few started cells in CA1), or at least this needs to be addressed. Perhaps the nucleus reuniens should be included as a major afferent to HP. Finally, it is critical to show retrogradely labeled cells at higher magnification, at present all that can be seen are red areas, no individual cells can be distinguished. Lastly, is the PFC in Figure 2P meant to represent the entire prefrontal cortex or the ACA?</p></disp-quote><p>We have added a supplementary figure with additional examples of injection site, made with a confocal microscope as well as quantification of the number of starter cells per image as well as estimate of the total number of starter cells present in the brain parenchyma. The starter cells are now easier to see with the updated images. We have included more higher magnification images of the retrogradely-labelled neurons now. The starter cells density could be considered a little on the low side, but we have added quantitative data, classical retrograde tracing, and more discussion of starter cell density as a potential caveat.</p><p>NRe is not included in the images as we believe that it only targets inhibitory interneurons in hippocampus proper, but does target pyramidal cells in prosubiculum and subiculum (as well as EC and PFC). Please refer to our preprint for more information â doi.org/10.1101/2021.09.30.462517. This finding was originally contentious (and the submission was rejected by <italic>eLife</italic>) but as can be seen from the studies that cite our preprint, evidence is growing in the literature that NRe projections to CA1 primarily or exclusively targets interneurons.</p><p>In figure 2P PFC includes the following sub-regions of the prefrontal cortices, including ACC, PL, IL.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Figure 3. When they indicate that the ACA injections from the Allen atlas where 100% or 90% contained within ACA, was this their estimate and if so how was this done. I assume that the density values are from the atlas, but how do they interpret the very low densities (i.e., in CA1, Sub or DG) when they are not zero? Although possibly for present purposes the Allen atlas may be sufficient, it is not comprehensive â as can be judged by the subcortical labeling profiles shown in Figure 3A-C. And the statement that the viral tracing of the Allen atlas is comparable to the transport properties of BDA is not reassuring in that BDA is a poor anterograde tracer.</p></disp-quote><p>In figure 3 the 90-100% of the virus refers to the proportion of volume of virus that is restricted to the ACC area specifically. This is the Allen Atlas estimate, not ours, based on optical analyses. The very low counts reflect the almost inevitable background that will be present. This is the reason why we used counts from areas known NOT to receive ACA inputs to give a background control level. These same background measures helped to verify the lack of any transport to the target hippocampal regions.</p><p>We have modified the statement regarding the viral tracing method and BDA, reflecting the exact statements in the Allen atlas. Those statements confirm that AAV was at least as efficient as, and more specific than, the classic anterograde tracer biotinylated dextran amine. In other words, the viral tracer is superior to BDA, while the comparison helped to confirm that it does not create false positive.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Figure 4. Very poor, can't see the retrograde cell labeling in cortical or subcortical structures. Like Figure 2 labeled cells need to be shown at high magnification.</p></disp-quote><p>We have taken all of the representative images using a confocal microscope, thus drastically improving the quality of the images, so individual cells can now be seen.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>4. The description (text) of their anterograde and retrograde tracing experiments in the Results needs to be expanded, only two relatively short paragraphs are devoted to each (anterograde and retrograde experiments) â and much less than the two and half pages devoted to the findings with Allen atlas. For instance, for the anterograde tracing only one sentence was devoted to describing their results (p. 9), essentially only stating that they observed ACA projections to the &quot;retrosplenial cortex and several thalamic nuclei&quot; but no labeling in the hippocampus. The text of the Results should describe the data of Figure 1, panel by panel. The same for the retrograde experiment.</p></disp-quote><p>We have added a thorough description of the data presented on figure 1 and figure 4 with the retrograde labelling.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>5. The Discussion was rather incomplete. They should provide a more thorough summary of their findings at the outset of the Discussion. While, as they indicate, the Rajasethupath et al. (2015) study is very influential and hence the need to devote considerable attention to it, the Bian et al. (2019) study probably deserves to be discussed in greater detail. For instance, it was only described in the Discussion and not throughout the manuscript; perhaps it should be mentioned in the Introduction. Additionally, it was not well described in the Discussion. The section entitled &quot;Stereotaxic coordinates and the borders of the anterior cingulate cortex&quot; is out of place and not relevant to the Discussion. Some of this could be included in the Introduction or Methods, that is, ACA nomenclature and coordinates. The Discussion should put a greater emphasis on their overall findings â not just the lack of ACA connections with the hippocampus but importantly their verification of other (typical) ACA outputs or HP inputs. Seemingly, this was not done in the Rajasethupath et al. or Bian et al. studies and should have been.</p></disp-quote><p>We have now substantially expanded and re-written the Discussion section to discuss the positive controls (known projections that we found from ACA), considered Bian in greater detail, and to more fully discuss different studies looking at anterograde and retrograde tracing from ACA and HPC, respectively. We have also incorporated some whole brain single cell PFC projectome data from a recent publication (Gao et al., 2022, https://www.nature.com/articles/s41593-022-01041-5) which further supported our findings.</p><p>The discussion of ACA borders has been edited and moved to the methods section.</p></body></sub-article></article>
