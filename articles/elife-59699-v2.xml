release of small-molecule neurotransmitters packaged into synaptic vesicles (SVs). Although many molecules have been identified as neurotransmitters, technical limitations have precluded a full metabolomic analysis of SV content. Here, we present a workflow to rapidly isolate SVs and to interrogate their metabolic contents at high-resolution using mass spectrometry. We validated the enrichment of glutamate in SVs of primary cortical neurons using targeted polar metabolomics. Unbiased and extensive global profiling of SVs isolated from these neurons revealed that the only detectable polar metabolites they contain are the established neurotransmitters glutamate and GABA. In addition, we adapted the approach to enable quick capture of SVs directly from brain tissue and determined the neurotransmitter profiles of diverse brain regions in a cell-type-specific manner. The speed, robustness, and precision of this method to interrogate SV contents will facilitate novel insights into the chemical basis of neurotransmission.</p></abstract><kwd-group

neurotransmitters, a diverse class of small molecules that act as chemical messengers between neurons. Neurotransmitters are stored in synaptic vesicles (SVs), membrane-bound organelles located within presynaptic axon terminals and whose activity-dependent release is essential for proper transmission of information within the brain (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib40">Jahn and Südhof, 1994</xref>). Upon electrical excitation of a neuron via action potentials, SVs rapidly fuse with the membrane to release their neurotransmitters, which are detected by transmembrane receptors on a postsynaptic neuron (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib80">Südhof, 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib85">Traynelis et al., 2014</xref>). This binding event can trigger diverse consequences to the postsynaptic neuron, depending on the identity of the neurotransmitter and the receptors to which it binds. Whereas some neurotransmitters cause acute electrical activation or inhibition of a neuron by opening ion channels, others result in longer-term modulation of its signaling network by activating G-protein coupled receptors (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib56">Nicoll et al., 1990</xref>). Thus, the functional contribution of a neuron to a circuit is defined by the neurotransmitters it releases and the postsynaptic cells that it contacts.</p><p>Although neurotransmitters were discovered more than a century ago, our understanding of what molecules are used as neurotransmitters and how they change during life is likely incomplete. Neurons were classically believed to release only one fast-acting neurotransmitter, whose identity was fixed throughout the lifetime of the neuron (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib79">Strata and Harvey, 1999</xref>). However, neurons in many brain regions have recently been discovered to release multiple neurotransmitters (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Hnasko and Edwards, 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib41">Jonas et al., 1998</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib69">Root et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib74">Shabel et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib86">Tritsch et al., 2012</xref>). Further increasing the complexity, these neurotransmitters may be packaged within the same or different SV pools or released from distinct axon terminals (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Hnasko and Edwards, 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib70">Saunders et al., 2015</xref>). Each possibility has unique effects on functionality and plasticity within circuits. In addition, neurons in the developing and mature brain have been found to lose, add, or switch the neurotransmitters they release in an activity-dependent manner (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Dulcis et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib77">Spitzer, 2012</xref>). Finally, synapses exist in which the neurotransmitters released remain unknown. Although many neurons have been found to contain the machinery to synthesize and potentially release neurotransmitters, it remains to be established if this release occurs and whether it has functional consequences (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib54">Mickelsen et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib84">Trapp and Cork, 2015</xref>). Altogether, these discoveries greatly expand how neurotransmitters control brain circuitry and reveal the complexities that remain to be deduced.</p><p>Current techniques to infer the neurotransmitter identity of neurons rely on detecting the molecular machinery involved in synthesizing, packaging, or binding to neurotransmitters; however, these methods have several caveats which limit their applicability. Low mRNA and protein expression levels coupled with poor reagents for detection lead to false negatives and inaccurate conclusions (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Hnasko and Edwards, 2012</xref>). Moreover, these approaches do not account for neurons that use unknown neurotransmitters or non-canonical pathways for neurotransmitter synthesis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib44">Kim et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib86">Tritsch et al., 2012</xref>). In addition, the substrate specificities for many neurotransmitter receptors and vesicular transporters remain unclear (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib94">Yelin and Schuldiner, 1995</xref>). Alternatively, neurotransmitter identity is often inferred by pharmacological analysis of the receptors that mediate postsynaptic effects; for instance, a synaptic current is assumed to be induced by GABA release if it is blocked by an antagonist of ionotropic GABA receptors. However, many neurotransmitter receptors can be activated or allosterically modulated by diverse sets of small molecules that are found within cells, making this pharmacological approach difficult to interpret (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib51">Macdonald and Olsen, 1994</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib61">Patneau and Mayer, 1990</xref>).</p><p>Many of these concerns can be addressed by direct profiling of SV contents using mass spectrometry (MS), a powerful tool that identifies diverse metabolites in a systematic, sensitive and robust manner (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib62">Patti et al., 2012</xref>). Indeed, MS has greatly expanded our understanding of organellar biology by providing insight into their rich and dynamic metabolomes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Abu-Remaileh et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Chen et al., 2016</xref>). To accurately profile the metabolic contents of SVs, quick and specific purification methods for SVs are required. However, current protocols are optimized for proteomic characterizations of SVs and require several hours to days to complete, during which the activity of transporters and biosynthetic enzymes may alter the contents of purified SVs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Ahmed et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Chen et al., 2016</xref>). More importantly, these protocols are difficult to apply to specific neuronal populations in complex tissue.</p><p>To overcome these caveats, we developed a method to rapidly immunopurify SVs from both cultured mouse neurons and intact mouse brains within half an hour. In combination, we employed MS to directly and comprehensively interrogate the metabolic contents of SVs. With this workflow, we characterized the neurotransmitter profiles for diverse brain regions in a cell-type- specific manner. This method will serve as a foundation to discover and understand the diverse ways that neurons communicate with one another to control brain function.</p></sec><sec id="s2" sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><sec id="s2-1"><title>A method for rapid and specific capture of SVs from cultured neurons</title><p>In developing a method to dramatically reduce SV purification times while maintaining purity, we were inspired by immunoprecipitation (IP)-based workflows for organellar isolation which are highly specific and do not require time-consuming differential centrifugation techniques classically used to isolate organelles (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Abu-Remaileh et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Chen et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib66">Ray et al., 2020</xref>). We developed SV-tag, a construct in which a hemagglutinin (HA) tag is fused to the C-terminus of synaptophysin, an SV-specific, integral membrane protein and an ideal candidate to tag due to its ubiquitous presence and high abundance on SVs (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1A</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib82">Takamori et al., 2006</xref>). In addition, we appended a tdTomato sequence followed by a self-cleaving T2A sequence to allow quick identification of infected cells via florescence. This strategy has several advantages compared to using an antibody against endogenous synaptophysin to isolate SVs. First, the SV-tag construct can be easily modified to express in genetically-defined subpopulations, which is crucial given the heterogeneity of neurons and brain tissue. Furthermore, the HA antibody is highly specific, sensitive, and well-characterized. Finally, the SV-tag strategy enables this method to be generalizable as the HA-tag is easily appended to other proteins and is compatible with many other applications, including metabolic and proteomic studies (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Chen et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">Huttlin et al., 2015</xref>).</p><fig-group><fig id="fig1" position="float"><label>Figure 1.</label><caption><title>A method for rapid and specific isolation of synaptic vesicles (SVs) from mouse primary cortical cultures.</title><p>(<bold>A</bold>) Construct design for tagging SVs and schematic of the workflow used to isolate SVs.

In cultured mouse cortical neurons, the expression of SV-tag did not alter glutamate release from these cells, as determined by recording spontaneous miniature excitatory post-synaptic currents (mEPSCs) at a holding potential of −70 mV in the presence of TTX and gabazine (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1B–C</xref>). To assess the localization of SV-tag, we compared its distribution to that of synapsin-1 and bassoon, both markers of presynaptic boutons (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">De Camilli et al., 1983</xref>; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1D and E</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1A</xref>). Although SV-tag colocalizes with synapsin and bassoon, a fraction of it is also detected in the soma in apparently synapsin-free areas (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1E</xref>). In contrast, endogenous synaptophysin completely colocalizes with synapsin, with a small fraction of the signal in the perinuclear area (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1D</xref>). We therefore pursued multiple optimization routes to improve the targeting of SV-tag. We moved the HA-tag to the N-terminus, lowered expression levels, tagged endogenous synaptophysin using CRISPR, tested other epitope tags (FLAG, GFP), and tagged other SV resident proteins (SV2A, VAMP2, synaptotagmin) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1B</xref>). Surprisingly, for all of these approaches the epitope tagged protein exhibited somatic localization comparable to that of SV-tag (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1B</xref>). This suggests that for recombinant SV proteins, it is difficult to achieve the correct level of expression to ensure that they are trafficked from the soma to the boutons. Alternatively, it could indicate that a population of endogenous synaptophysin is somatically localized but not accessible by the synaptophysin antibody. This latter hypothesis is supported by the appearance of a somatic pool of synaptophysin when an HA-tag was introduced into the endogenous gene (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1B</xref>, top row). Therefore, we decided to use our original synaptophysin-based SV-tag construct, due to the advantages of synaptophysin being a protein that is easy to express, abundant, and ubiquitously present on SVs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib82">Takamori et al., 2006</xref>).</p><p>Based on a series of classical SV purification methods (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">De Camilli et al., 1983</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Craige et al., 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">Huttner et al., 1983</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib55">Nagy et al., 1976</xref>), we developed a workflow to immunoisolate SVs from cultured cortical neurons within 30 min, a substantial reduction in time compared to the multiple hours to days needed for classical methods (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1A</xref>). First, we formed synaptosomes, which are isolated synaptic terminals (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1C</xref>). Unlike direct cell lysis to release SVs, this process affords us a key advantage of separating and discarding the soma, along with its mislocalized SV-tag. We isolated synaptosomes within just seven minutes by optimizing the homogenization steps needed to generate synaptosomes and the speed and duration of spins that are necessary to separate unlysed cells from synaptosomes. ATP was added throughout the purification to maintain vATPase function, which establishes the proton gradient across the SV membrane that is necessary for the import of neurotransmitters and the maintenance of their levels within SVs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Burger et al., 1989</xref>). Following hypotonic lysis of the synaptosomes to release SVs, we immunoprecipitated SVs using HA antibodies conjugated to solid magnetic beads. The reduced porosity and magnetic properties of these beads enable cleaner, quicker capture compared to standard agarose beads, which can trap metabolite contaminants within their porous bead matrix (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Chen et al., 2016</xref>). A series of high-salt washes post-immunoprecipitation disrupted non-specific protein and metabolite interactions and further reduced contaminants. During our initial attempts to IP SVs, we used a triple HA-tag. Although this was sufficient to capture SVs as assessed by immunoblotting, the yield was low (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1D</xref>). We reasoned that additional repeats of the HA epitope would increase capture efficiency by enhancing the probability that the tag will encounter an antibody during the IP period. Indeed, an extended tag of nine tandem HA sequences increased the yield of SVs despite expressing at a lower level than the triple HA-tag (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1D</xref>).</p><p>To assess the quality and integrity of SVs isolated by this rapid procedure, we characterized the isolate remaining at the end of the purification for multiple features of SVs. Using immunoblotting, we confirmed the enrichment of SV protein markers such as synaptotagmin and SV2A and the concomitant depletion of markers for other subcellular organelles, compartments, and membranes (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1F</xref>). One exception was the slight enrichment of dendritic endosomal membranes, as marked by the presence of transferrin receptor in our isolates. Improvements in the localization of SV-tag may help to alleviate this non-specific capture. We also used mass spectrometry to profile the proteome of isolated SVs in depth and found that the most significantly enriched proteins were SV resident proteins, including glutamate transporters, synaptobrevin, and vATPase subunits (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="supp1">Supplementary file 1</xref>; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1E</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Grønborg et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib82">Takamori et al., 2006</xref>). Furthermore, transmission electron microscopy revealed that the majority of particles isolated from our workflow are spheres of ~40–70 nm in diameter (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Eshkind and Leube, 1995</xref>), as expected for SVs (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1G</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1F</xref>). In addition, we observed particles less than 40 nm, which may be membrane fragments resulting from high-salt washes performed at the end of the isolation to reduce contaminants. A minority of larger particles (<underline>&gt;</underline>100 nm) are also present, which may be large dense-core vesicles (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Gondré-lewis et al., 2012</xref>) or contaminating organelles and cellular debris. Finally, SVs isolated with SV-tag are comparable to those purified via lengthier, traditional differential centrifugation protocols, as assessed by immunoblot (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1H</xref>) and electron microscopy (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1I</xref>), albeit with a reduction in yield that comes as a tradeoff for the speed of isolation. To quantify yield of our workflow, we calculated how much of the SV material present in the input was captured in the immunoprecipitate. Based on three SV markers, our yields were ~1.5% (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1G</xref>), which is consistent with previous rapid organellar isolations (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Chen et al., 2017</xref>). Furthermore, we performed quantitative immunoblotting to determine that our preps were 10-fold enriched in SVs, as based on synaptobrevin (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1H</xref>). This is lower than the 20X enrichment reported for previous isolation methods (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Ahmed et al., 2013</xref>).</p><p>Although these analyses indicate we were able to enrich for SVs, they do not provide evidence that the SVs are intact, which is crucial for subsequent metabolite analysis. If the integrity of isolated SVs is not compromised, they should contain glutamate, the principal neurotransmitter of cultured cortical neurons (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Beaudoin et al., 2012</xref>). Using a luminescence-based assay to detect glutamate, we observed an enrichment of glutamate in isolated SVs compared to the material obtained when the same protocol was applied to uninfected neurons (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1J</xref>). Importantly, glutamate was depleted upon treatment of neurons with BafilomycinA (BafA), a vATPase inhibitor that dissipates the proton gradient of SVs that is essential for the import of glutamate into SVs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Bowman et al., 1988</xref>). In our isolation, it was not necessary to supplement ATP with magnesium (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1K</xref>), likely due to the rapidity of the method and/or sufficient levels of magnesium released during cell lysis to maintain vATPase function. Taken together, multiple lines of evidence demonstrate that our SV-tag workflow enables rapid and specific high-affinity capture of intact SVs.</p></sec><sec id="s2-2"><title>Targeted and global metabolite profile of SVs from cultured neurons</title><p>To interrogate the metabolite contents of SVs in a precise and robust manner, we initially used targeted gas chromatography-mass spectrometry (GC/MS), a method with high sensitivity for many analytes, low cost and ease of operation, all of which are important considerations for optimization studies (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Beale et al., 2018</xref>). We selected a panel of amino acids to profile, which included bona fide neurotransmitters (glutamate and glycine) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">Gundersen et al., 2005</xref>), a putative neurotransmitter (aspartate) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Fleck and Palmerv, 1993</xref>), and non-neurotransmitter amino acids to assess the cleanliness of our preps. To identify metabolites that are enriched in SVs, we compared the signal of metabolites present in HA immunoprecipitates from SV-tag infected neurons vs. the signal from immunoprecipitates of uninfected neurons, which served as a control for metabolites that non-specifically adhere to HA beads (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Chen et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="supp3">Supplementary file 3</xref>).

Importantly, non-neurotransmitter amino acids were not enriched, demonstrating that our SV preparations are of high purity as they lack contaminating metabolites.

Unlike cortical cultures, these neurons are GABAergic, as evidenced by their expression of VGAT, a GABA transporter (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib93">Wojcik et al., 2006</xref>), and their lack of VGLUT1 protein, a glutamate transporter (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib64">Pines et al., 1992</xref>; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s1">Figure 2—figure supplement 1B</xref>). Reflecting the differences in the neurotransmitter identities of cortical and MGE-derived neurons, GC/MS analysis revealed that SVs isolated from MGE cells are enriched for GABA but not glutamate, whereas the converse is observed for cortical cultures (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s1">Figure 2—figure supplement 1C</xref>). Highlighting the specificity of our method, MGE SVs were not significantly enriched for any other amino acids profiled. Thus, by combining the SV-tag isolation workflow with GC/MS, we can successfully obtain neurotransmitter profiles of diverse neuron subtypes.</p><p>Although GC/MS provides a strong starting point for analysis, it is limited in its capacity to detect a wide range of polar metabolites, due to the need for polar metabolite volatilization and separation on a GC column (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib47">Lei et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib76">Sobolevsky et al., 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib78">Stenerson, 2011</xref>). Therefore, we transitioned to metabolomic analysis by liquid chromatography – high-resolution mass spectrometry (LC/MS), which can detect a much broader range of metabolites with nanomolar sensitivity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib47">Lei et al., 2011</xref>). We quantified the relative abundance of 153 polar compounds, which included neurotransmitters such as acetylcholine, serotonin, and epinephrine, as well as key molecules in metabolic pathways and subcellular compartments (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="supp2">Supplementary file 2</xref>). Corroborating our earlier findings with GC/MS, glutamate was the sole detected metabolite that is significantly enriched within SV-tag isolated SVs (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2C</xref>) and depleted upon BafA treatment (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2D</xref>; <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="supp5">Supplementary file 5</xref>). All other metabolites were either undetected or detected at statistically insignificant levels. Reflecting the specificity of our workflow for isolating SVs, markers for other subcellular compartments were not enriched, including cystine, which is characteristic of lysosomes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib65">Pisoni and Thoene, 1991</xref>), and aspartate and phosphocholine, which are the most enriched metabolites in mitochondria (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Chen et al., 2016</xref>).</p><p>Because vATPase resides in other organelles (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Futai et al., 2000</xref>), the observation that its inhibition depletes glutamate is not sufficient to provide certainty that the glutamate detected is within SVs. To address this concern, we took advantage of the fact that glutamate is imported into SVs via glutamate transporters VGLUT1 and VGLUT2 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib81">Takamori et al., 2001</xref>), which, unlike vATPase, are SV-specific proteins (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Fremeau et al., 2001</xref>).

Taken together, these results demonstrate that our purification workflow isolates SVs of high purity and integrity which are compatible for robust and sensitive profiling with multiple MS methods.</p><p>Previous work has proposed that other polar molecules may function as neurotransmitters, including taurine, gamma-hydroxybutyrate, ß-alanine, and agmatine (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Cash, 1994</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Davison and Kaczmarek, 1971</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib43">Kilb and Fukuda, 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib67">Reis and Regunathan, 2000</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib83">Tiedje et al., 2010</xref>). To gain a more comprehensive and unbiased view of the SV metabolome, we performed a global metabolomics screen for polar metabolites (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3A–B</xref>). The LC/MS runs were optimized for detection of a broad range of polar retentivities using a HILIC stationary phase and fast polarity- switching MS method to capture analytes which ionize exclusively in positive or negative mode.

To assign the peak identity of this small subset of features, we used a variety of manual approaches including spectral library search, accurate mass formula search, and isotope fine structure. To our surprise, only three metabolites satisfied these criteria – glutamate, GABA, and potassium (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3C</xref>, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="supp4">Supplementary file 4</xref>). In these samples, GABA likely originates from a minority population of interneurons in cultured cortical neurons, consistent with the low expression level of VGAT, the GABA transporter, observed in these cultures (Figure S2B). The variability of the number of GABAergic interneurons across different cortical culture preps likely contributes to the variation in the GABA levels detected across MS runs. In addition to GABA, we identified a peak that is associated with potassium, which arises from the putative pairing of this ion with carbonate ions in the LC buffers used in the IP/MS workflow. However, potassium is a ubiquitous component of multiple reagents and sample-to-sample fluctuations in their levels can contribute to altered potassium content. Follow-up studies using atomic absorption spectroscopy or inductively coupled plasma mass spectrometry (ICP-MS) will be necessary to establish how much potassium these SVs quantitatively contain, whether these weakly enriched potassium peaks are indeed internalized within SVs, and if they contribute to SV function.</p></sec><sec id="s2-3"><title>Adaptation of the method for SV isolation and profiling from brain tissue</title><p>Given their relative homogeneity of neuron types and ease of preparation, cultured cortical neurons provide an ideal setting to optimize and test purification protocols. However, in the brain, molecularly and functionally distinct neurons are intermingled in an intricate and heterogeneous environment, and they rely on the uptake of extracellular metabolites found in this environment for neurotransmitter synthesis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Elsworth and Roth, 1997</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib53">Mathews and Diamond, 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib72">Schousboe et al., 2013</xref>). To gain a more complete understanding of neurotransmission and potentially identify unknown endogenous neurotransmitters, it is necessary to profile SVs isolated from their native environment. We therefore adapted the method for use in brain tissue (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4A</xref>). First, we expressed SV-tag in the brain by transducing desired brain regions of mice via stereotaxic injections of adeno-associated viruses (AAV) encoding Cre-independent SV-tag. To ensure neuron-specific expression, the expression of SV-tag was driven by the synapsin promoter (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib45">Kügler et al., 2003</xref>). SV-tag readily expresses in diverse areas, as evidenced by the abundance of tdTomato positive neurons in targeted regions (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4B</xref>). To ensure that SV-tag does not impair neurotransmission in vivo, we examined synaptic transmission at well-characterized Schaffer collateral synapses between hippocampal CA3 and CA1 pyramidal cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s1">Figure 4—figure supplement 1A</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">Jackman et al., 2014</xref>).

This is not surprising given the complex structure and composition of brain tissue compared to cultured neurons, which grow as a homogeneous monolayer. To resolve these issues, we compared several lysis protocols for their efficiency in releasing SVs from neurons. Compared to forming and lysing synaptosomes, homogenizing the whole brain to immediately free SVs greatly improved yields (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s1">Figure 4—figure supplement 1D</xref>). Importantly, a motorized homogenizer was necessary for effective and rapid lysis. The addition of a final five-minute high-salt incubation after the IP further reduced background contamination. In combination, these changes enabled SV isolation in under 30 min from diverse brain regions, including hippocampus, cortex, and striatum (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4C</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s1">Figure 4—figure supplement 1E</xref>). Moreover, SVs had minimal contamination of other subcellular organelles as demonstrated by immunoblot and electron microscope analyses (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4C</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s1">Figure 4—figure supplement 1E, F</xref>).</p><p>Utilizing the LC/MS workflow, we determined if our method is capable of distinguishing the content of SVs isolated from brain regions with different neurotransmitter profiles. We profiled SVs from the hippocampus, which is composed of roughly 90% glutamatergic pyramidal neurons and 10% GABAergic interneurons (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib58">Olbrich and Braak, 1985</xref>), and the striatum, which is comprised primarily of GABAergic cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib95">Yoshida and Precht, 1971</xref>). The metabolite profiles of hippocampal SVs are expected, with glutamate and GABA detected and glutamate being the more abundant neurotransmitter (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4D</xref>). Similar to cortical culture SVs, no other metabolites other than these two known neurotransmitters were significantly present.</p><p>In contrast, striatal SVs were contaminated by a significant amount of glutamate. Because SV-tag was expressed in a Cre-independent manner in wild-type mice, this could result from isolation of SVs from glutamatergic cortical neurons that lie above striatum and became infected with SV-tag due to pipette withdrawal and viral leak or via retrograde transduction due to axonal-uptake of AAV. Alternatively, it could be due to contamination by cortical and thalamic glutamatergic terminals that heavily innervate the striatum. To distinguish between these possibilities, we generated a Cre-dependent construct of SV-tag to enable cell-type-specific expression of this IP handle (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4F</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Atasoy et al., 2008</xref>). Striatal SVs from <italic>Slc32a1<sup>IRES-Cre</sup></italic> mice, where SV-tag expression is restricted to GABAergic neurons (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib91">Vong et al., 2011</xref>) and SVs from <italic>Adora2a<sup>Cre</sup></italic> mice, which restrict expression further to a subpopulation of GABAergic striatal neurons (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Durieux et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s1">Figure 4—figure supplement 1G</xref>), reveal the enrichment of GABA and the concomitant depletion of glutamate (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4G</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s1">Figure 4—figure supplement 1H</xref>). Altogether, these results indicate that cell-type specific expression of SV-tag permits analysis of SV content on material isolated directly from complex brain tissue.</p><p>Thus far we focused on the detection of neurotransmitters whose polar and stable nature is compatible for sensitive detection by LC/MS. However, some neurotransmitters are less stable, such as the rapidly oxidizable dopamine, a crucial neurotransmitter whose loss underlies debilitating motor ailments such as Parkinson’s disease (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Damier et al., 1999</xref>). To test if, despite its labile nature, our rapid SV isolation workflow enables detection of dopamine, we expressed SV-tag in midbrain substantia nigra neurons of <italic>Slc6a3<sup>IRES-Cre</sup></italic> mice where Cre recombinase is restricted to cells expressing DAT, the plasma membrane dopamine transporter. As has been previously demonstrated in the injection target, Cre-expressing cells in this mouse line match well with the population of neurons that express VMAT2, the vesicular dopamine transporter (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Edwards, 1992</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib46">Lammel et al., 2015</xref>). We validated specificity of expression by immunohistochemical analysis, which indicated selective expression of SV-tag in dopaminergic cells as seen by colocalization with tyrosine hydroxylase, a dopamine synthetic enzyme (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Daubner et al., 2011</xref>) both in the soma and in axonal projections to striatum (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4H</xref>). In a cohort of mice expressing SV-tag, we administered tetrabenazine, a reversible inhibitor of VMAT2 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Erickson et al., 1996</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib71">Scherman et al., 1983</xref>), at a concentration validated to deplete dopamine from SVs in acute striatal slices (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s1">Figure 4—figure supplement 1I–J</xref>). Using a modified LC/MS method for the detection of dopamine, we find that substantia nigra SVs are enriched for dopamine and these stores are depleted by VMAT2 inhibition (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4I</xref>). Taken together, we developed a workflow to enable rapid and specific purification of SVs directly from the brain, and to obtain the neurotransmitter profiles of a wide range of neurons in a cell-type-specific manner.</p></sec></sec><sec id="s3" sec-type="discussion"><title>Discussion</title><p>Neurons use a broad array of small molecules for fast chemical neurotransmission. The ability for different neuron classes to release different transmitters, along with the diversity of neurotransmitter-specific postsynaptic receptors, enables complex and intermingled excitatory, inhibitory, and neuromodulatory trans-synaptic signaling in dense brain tissue. Furthermore, individual neurons are able to release multiple transmitters, sometimes releasing different neurotransmitters to different postsynaptic targets, as well as switch neurotransmitter identity in a developmental and activity dependent manner. This richness of neurotransmitter usage in the brain highlights the need for new methods to deduce neurotransmitter identity in an accurate and cell-type-specific manner. To address these needs, we developed a workflow that combines high-affinity capture of epitope tagged SVs with MS-based metabolomics to comprehensively profile SV contents. We adapted our method to isolate SVs with speed and ease from both primary cultured neurons and genetically-defined neurons in brain tissue, which will allow complementary in vitro and in vivo studies in the future. Our study confirms the utility of combining IP- and MS-based methods to characterize organelles such as SVs, and underscores the importance of performing global analyses to draw unbiased conclusions of the metabolic contents of organelles.</p><p>Our analyses of polar metabolites in SVs profiled in this study reveal that these organelles have a minimal metabolic content and contain only previously recognized <italic>bona fide</italic> neurotransmitters, which is consistent with their primary role in neurotransmitter storage and release. We find that glutamatergic vesicles, isolated from either cultured neurons or directly from the brain, contain only glutamate and lack detectable amounts of other proposed neurotransmitters (such as aspartate). Indeed, untargeted analysis of polar metabolites failed to detect any additional molecule that was enriched within these vesicles. It is possible that non-polar molecules and ions could also be imported into SVs. Indeed, zinc has been proposed to function as a neurotransmitter at excitatory synapses (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib89">Vergnano et al., 2014</xref>). In future studies, it will be beneficial to modify our workflow to be compatible with MS methods for atomic ion and non-polar metabolite detection. In addition, further optimization of the immunocapture procedure to increase SV yields is necessary to utilize MS methods for atomic ion detection, which require high amounts of starting material. Finally, further enhancements in the sensitivity of MS detection of metabolites coupled with more extensive profiling of other neuronal cell types in vivo may uncover putative neurotransmitters.</p><p>Although our method is rapid and specific, improvements to increase its sensitivity for neurotransmitter detection, particularly from SVs isolated from the brain, would be beneficial, even for the detection of polar metabolites. We were able to identify dopamine in SVs from substantia nigra neurons, but not GABA and glutamate (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib87">Tritsch et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib96">Zhang et al., 2015</xref>), which are known to be released by these cells. In addition, we observed a robust GABA signal in SVs from striatal cells but did not detect acetylcholine, which is released by a small population of interneurons that reside in this region (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Cox and Witten, 2019</xref>). As cholinergic neurons represent about 2% of striatal neurons (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib97">Zhou et al., 2002</xref>), this suggests a lower limit for the ability of our current protocol to detect minor neurotransmitters. The yield of SVs captured by our method and thus the detection limit would likely be increased by the use of a mouse line in which synaptophysin is endogenously tagged with HA in a conditional manner. This would permit more uniform and complete expression of SV-tag in desired cells without ectopic overexpression, and thus increase SV yields and the consistency between preps. Furthermore, it would eliminate the need for tedious injections and facilitate greater turnaround time of experiments.</p><p>With a method to identify molecules that are enriched in SVs, we can pursue many intriguing questions and avenues. To determine whether specific molecules function as neurotransmitters, candidates can be easily profiled for their presence inside SVs using our workflow. For instance, in the context of cultured neurons and the brain regions profiled in this study, neither aspartate nor taurine - molecules long debated to be neurotransmitters - were enriched within SVs, thus bringing into doubt their potential synaptic functions. Analysis in the hippocampus also failed to find evidence in support of aspartate being a neurotransmitter (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">Herring et al., 2015</xref>). Another important avenue of research is elucidating the function of transporter-like SV proteins such as SV2A and defining the substrate specificities of promiscuous vesicular transporters, including VMAT2 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib50">Lynch et al., 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib94">Yelin and Schuldiner, 1995</xref>). Loss of function experiments combined with global MS profiling will provide a powerful strategy to interrogate how these proteins affect SV function. Finally, this method can be easily adapted to other applications to resolve long-standing questions about SVs. For instance, the release properties of SVs have long been known to be heterogeneous, and only a fraction of SVs known as the rapidly releasable pool fuse upon electrical excitation of a neuron (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib68">Rizzoli and Betz, 2005</xref>). Proteomic profiling of these different SV populations following immunoisolation could reveal the molecular basis for these differences, which has long eluded researchers. Finally, this method can facilitate the identification of neurons which corelease multiple transmitters and follow-up studies with higher resolution methods such as EM or array tomography can address the basis of this corelease and if it occurs from the same or different vesicle. In combination, these possibilities highlight the potential of SV immunoisolation and metabolomics to address a wide range of biological questions.</p><p>In conclusion, the robustness and ease of our SV isolation and profiling methodology will serve as a platform upon which we can gain a deeper understanding of the diverse ways that these organelles control neurotransmission.</p></sec><sec id="s4" sec-type="materials|methods"><title>Materials and methods</title><table-wrap id="keyresource" position="anchor"><label>Key resources table</label><table frame="hsides" rules="groups"><thead><tr><th valign="top">Reagent type <break/>(species) or resource</th><th valign="top">Designation</th><th valign="top">Source or reference</th><th valign="top">Identifiers</th><th valign="top">Additional information</th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td valign="top">Strain, strain background (<italic>M. musculus</italic>)</td><td valign="top">Wild-type</td><td valign="top">Jackson Labs</td><td valign="top">C57BL6/J, RRID:<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://scicrunch.org/resolver/MGI:5650797">MGI:5650797</ext-link></td><td valign="top">Stock #00644</td></tr><tr><td valign="top">Strain, strain background (<italic>M. musculus</italic>)</td><td valign="top">Albino Swiss mice</td><td valign="top">Charles River</td><td valign="top">CD-1 IGS, RRID:<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://scicrunch.org/resolver/MGI:5653285">MGI:5653285</ext-link></td><td valign="top">Stock #022</td></tr><tr><td valign="top">Strain, strain background (<italic>M. musculus</italic>)</td><td valign="top">Vgat<sup>ires-cre</sup></td><td valign="top">Jackson Labs</td><td valign="top"><italic>Slc32a1</italic><sup>IRES-Cre</sup>, RRID:<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://scicrunch.org/resolver/IMSR_NM-KI-200081">IMSR_NM-KI-200081</ext-link></td><td valign="top">Stock #016962</td></tr><tr><td valign="top">Strain, strain background (<italic>M. musculus</italic>)</td><td valign="top">Dat<sup>ires-cre</sup></td><td valign="top">Jackson Labs</td><td valign="top"><italic>Slc6a3</italic><sup>IRES-Cre,</sup>RRID:<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://scicrunch.org/resolver/IMSR_NM-KI-200092">IMSR_NM-KI-200092</ext-link></td><td valign="top">Stock #006660</td></tr><tr><td valign="top">Strain, strain background (<italic>M. musculus</italic>)</td><td valign="top"><italic>Adora2a</italic><sup>Cre</sup></td><td valign="top">GENSAT</td><td valign="top">RRID:<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://scicrunch.org/resolver/MMRRC_034744-UCD">MMRRC_034744-UCD</ext-link></td><td valign="top">founder line KG139</td></tr><tr><td valign="top">Strain, strain background (AAV)</td><td valign="top">AAV2/9 hSynapsin SV-tag WPRE</td><td valign="top">BCH Viral Core</td><td valign="top">NA</td><td valign="top">Titer: 1.6 × 1014 gc/ml</td></tr><tr><td valign="top">Strain, strain background (AAV)</td><td valign="top">AAV2/9 Cre floxed SV-tag WPRE</td><td valign="top">BCH Viral Core</td><td valign="top">NA</td><td valign="top">Titer: 1.7 × 1014 gc/ml</td></tr><tr><td valign="top">Antibody</td><td valign="top">Guinea pig polyclonal synaptophysin</td><td valign="top">Synaptic Systems</td><td valign="top">101004, RRID:<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://scicrunch.org/resolver/AB_1210382">AB_1210382</ext-link></td><td valign="top">(1:100) dilution</td></tr><tr><td valign="top">Antibody</td><td valign="top">Rabbit polyclonal synaptophysin</td><td valign="top">Synaptic Systems</td><td valign="top">101002, RRID:<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://scicrunch.org/resolver/AB_887905">AB_887905</ext-link></td><td valign="top">(1:1000) dilution</td></tr><tr><td valign="top">Antibody</td><td valign="top">Rabbit monoclonal synapsin</td><td valign="top">Cell Signaling Technology</td><td valign="top">5297S, RRID:<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://scicrunch.org/resolver/AB_261578">AB_261578</ext-link></td><td valign="top">(1:500) dilution</td></tr><tr><td valign="top">Antibody</td><td valign="top">Rabbit monoclonal HA-Tag</td><td valign="top">Cell Signaling Technology</td><td valign="top">3724S, RRID:<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://scicrunch.org/resolver/AB_1549585">AB_1549585</ext-link></td><td valign="top">(1:1000) dilution</td></tr><tr><td valign="top">Antibody</td><td valign="top">Mouse monoclonal synaptotagmin</td><td valign="top">Synaptic Systems</td><td valign="top">105011, RRID:<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://scicrunch.org/resolver/AB_887832">AB_887832</ext-link></td><td valign="top">(1:1500) dilution</td></tr><tr><td valign="top">Antibody</td><td valign="top">Mouse monoclonal synaptobrevin</td><td valign="top">Synaptic Systems</td><td valign="top">104211.

The centroided data were searched using an in-house python script Mighty_skeleton version 0.0.2 and peak heights were extracted from the mzXML files based on a previously established library of metabolite retention times and accurate masses adapted from the Whitehead Institute (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Chen et al., 2016</xref>), and verified with authentic standards and/or high-resolution MS/MS spectral manually curated against the NIST14MS/MS (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib90">Voge et al., 2016</xref>) and METLIN (2017) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib75">Smith et al., 2005</xref>) tandem mass spectral libraries. Metabolite peaks were extracted based on the theoretical <italic>m</italic>/<italic>z</italic> of the expected ion type for example [M+H]<sup>+</sup>, with a ± 5 part-per-million (ppm) tolerance, and a ± 7.5 s peak apex retention time tolerance within an initial retention time search window of ±0.5 min across the study samples.</p></sec><sec id="s4-21-2"><title>Detection of untargeted features</title><p>The MS1 level data in both positive and negative mode were searched for representative features across all study files using an in-house python script called Ungrid (version 0.5). The algorithm reduces all detected MS1 peak data into representative features by sorting intensity from high to low (across all samples) and then applying an array bisection algorithm (python v3.0.1) on the m/z and retention time values with custom tolerances (25 ppm m/z tolerance for peak discrimination, 0.5 min RT delta for chromatographic discrimination, 1e5 minimum intensity, 10X signal to noise (within spectrum)). The output is a list of representative high intensity features of a defined m/z and retention time. These feature intensities were then extracted across all samples using Mighty_skeleton (above) to give the peak intensities for each feature in each sample.</p></sec><sec id="s4-21-3"><title>Metabolomics informatics</title><p>The resulting data matrices of metabolite intensities for all samples and blank controls (either retention time library data or untargeted data) was processed with an in-house statistical pipeline Metabolyze version 1.0 and final peak detection was calculated based on a signal to noise ratio (S/N) of 3X compared to blank controls, with a floor of 10,000 (arbitrary units). For samples where the peak intensity was lower than the blank threshold, metabolites were annotated as not detected, and the threshold value was imputed for any statistical comparisons to enable an estimate of the fold change as applicable. The resulting blank corrected data matrix was then used for all group-wise comparisons, and t-tests were performed with the Python SciPy (1.1.0) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib42">Jones et al., 2020</xref>) library to test for differences and generate statistics for downstream analyses. Any metabolite with p-value&lt;0.05 was considered significantly regulated (up or down). Any outliers were omitted with the Grubb’s outlier test. Values are reported as log<sub>2</sub> fold changes ± standard error of the mean. In order to adjust for significant covariate effects (as applicable) in the experimental design the R package, DESeq2 (1.24.0) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib49">Love et al., 2014</xref>) was used to test for significant differences. Data processing for this correction required the blank corrected matrix to be imputed with zeroes for non-detected values instead of the blank threshold to avoid false positives. This corrected matrix was then analyzed utilizing DESeq2 to calculate the adjusted p-value in the covariate model.</p></sec></sec><sec id="s4-22"><title>Targeted LC/MS for absolute quantification of dopamine</title><p>Metabolite profiling was conducted on a QExactive bench top orbitrap mass spectrometer equipped with an Ion Max source and a HESI II probe, which was coupled to a Dionex UltiMate 3000 HPLC system (Thermo Fisher Scientific, San Jose, CA). External mass calibration was performed using the standard calibration mixture every 7 days. 5 µl were injected onto a SeQuant ZIC-pHILIC 150 × 2.1 mm analytical column equipped with a 2.1 × 20 mm guard column (both 5 mm particle size; EMD Millipore). The following method was adapted from <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib88">Tufi et al., 2015</xref>: Buffer A was 10 mM ammonium formate with 0.2% formic acid in 90% acetonitrile; Buffer B was water with 0.2% formic acid. The column oven and autosampler tray were held at 25°C and 4°C, respectively. The chromatographic gradient was run at a flow rate of 0.300 ml/min as follows: 0–2 min: hold at 0% B; 2.5–15 min.: linear gradient form 0–40% B; 15.5–16 min.: linear gradient from 40–0% B; 16–21 min.: hold at 0% B. The mass spectrometer was operated in full-scan, polarity-switching mode, with the spray voltage set to 3.0 kV, the heated capillary held at 275°C, and the HESI probe held at 350°C. The sheath gas flow was set to 40 units, the auxiliary gas flow was set to 15 units, and the sweep gas flow was set to one unit. MS data acquisition was performed in a range of <italic>m/z</italic> = 70–1000, with the resolution set at 70,000, the AGC targeted at 1 × 10<sup>6</sup>, and the maximum injection time was 20 msec. In addition, timed targeted selected ion monitoring (tSIM) scans were included in positive mode to enhance detection of Dopamine (<italic>m/z</italic> 154.08626). MS settings were as described above, with the AGC target set at 1 × 10<sup>5</sup>, the maximum injection time was 200 ms, and the isolation window was 1.0 <italic>m/z</italic>. Raw peak areas were normalized to phenylalanine-13C9-15N as an internal standard.</p></sec></sec></body><back><ack id="ack"><title>Acknowledgements</title><p>We thank all members of the Sabatini lab for helpful suggestions and advice, in particular T Consedine and G Radeljic for technical assistance and K Mastro, S Melzer, and A Girasole for manuscript input.

from Chantranupong et al. reports a new method for the immune-isolation of SVs based on the expression of a synaptophysin variant containing a HA-tag. This method allows for rapid isolation of SVs with high purity from both neuronal culture and mouse brain. The authors then carried out metabolomics profiling using LC/MS, allowing for detection, among many other metabolites, of neurotransmitters. This study addresses the classical question of SV content that has only become more important in recent years, due in particular to the accumulating evidence for co-release of classical neurotransmitters.</p><p><bold>Decision letter after peer review:</bold></p><p>Thank you for submitting your article &quot;Rapid purification and metabolomic profiling of SVs from mammalian brain&quot; for consideration by <italic>eLife</italic>.

The following individual involved in review of your submission has agreed to reveal their identity: Reinhard Jahn (Reviewer #3). The reviewers have discussed the reviews with one another and the Reviewing Editor has drafted this decision to help you prepare a revised submission.</p><p>We would like to draw your attention to changes in our revision policy that we have made in response to COVID-19 (https://elifesciences.org/articles/57162). Specifically, when editors judge that a submitted work as a whole belongs in <italic>eLife</italic> but that some conclusions require a modest amount of additional new data, as they do with your paper, we are asking that the manuscript be revised to either limit claims to those supported by data in hand, or to explicitly state that the relevant conclusions require additional supporting data. Our expectation is that the authors will eventually carry out the additional experiments and report on how they affect the relevant conclusions either in a preprint on bioRxiv or medRxiv, or if appropriate, as a Research Advance in <italic>eLife</italic>, either of which would be linked to the original paper.</p><p>Summary:</p><p>The manuscript from Chantranupong et al. reports a new method for the immune-isolation of SVs based on the expression of a synaptophysin variant containing a HA-tag. This method allows for rapid isolation of SVs with high purity from both neuronal culture and mouse brain. The authors then carried out metabolomics profiling using LC/MS, allowing for detection, among many other metabolites, of neurotransmitters. This study addresses the classical question of SV content that has only become more important in recent years, due in particular to the accumulating evidence for corelease of classical neurotransmitters. The authors demonstrate dependence of the SV contents on the H<sup>+</sup> pump, and sensitivity to inactivation of the vesicular glutamate or monoamine transporters. The Materials and methods also contain explicit information that will enable others to perform these experiments.</p><p>Essential revisions:</p><p>1) The authors use complementary mass spectrometry strategies to identify the expected glutamate and GABA in, respectively, excitatory and inhibitory neuron SVs, with no evidence for additional candidate transmitter. This is interesting although not necessarily definitive. Please comment.</p><p>2) With regard to specificity, the authors demonstrate that immunoisolation depends on expression of epitope-tagged synaptophysin, and excludes other organelles such as ER and mitochondria. However, many of these membranes are very different from SVs and it would be particularly helpful to know whether the method excludes endosomes, either axonal (such as GLUT4+) or dendritic (transferrin receptor+), which are more closely related to SVs.</p><p>3) Related to the previous point, it is difficult to assess the purity of the final SV fraction. Judged by the immunoblots, the only criterium is the loss of some proteins specific for other membranes. Moreover, the EM image shows the presence of larger membrane vesicles, but none of this is quantified. Some suggestions: Quantitative histograms of vesicle sizes in the EM pictures in order to assess the degree of contamination by large vesicles, adding more markers to the WB analysis, in particular for plasma membrane (e.g. Na, Ca-channels) and myelin), immunolabeling of the isolated vesicles for vesicle markers in order to confirm that at least the majority of the vesicles are indeed SVs.</p><p>4) One question not addressed specifically concerns yield. The authors do not indicate the yield from immunoisolation, and this will in the end limit their ability to identify novel SV contents, which presumably requires large amounts of material. Thus, it is important to know how much of the tagged protein is not immunoisolated using this more rapid approach. Along the same line, it is surprising that many of the westerns do not show enrichment of SV proteins. Since the HA antibody is apparently cross-linked to the beads, it should be possible to elute the material and at least indicate how much is loaded on the gel relative to the original homogenate, which would provide evidence for enrichment – the legend and Materials and methods do not appear to contain any information about the amount of material loaded (proportion vs. protein).</p><p>5) The value of this study depends on the evidence of improvement over previous methods. Since these were less well documented, it is difficult to know how much of an improvement is achieved by the introduction of an exogenous epitope tag over the use of an endogenous SV protein, but previous work was still able to detect accumulation of glutamate. In light of this question, it is important to document the yield as well as the specificity of the new approach.</p><p>6) Based on the microscopic images (Figure 1D and E and Figure 1—figure supplement 1), synapsin seems differently distributed (especially in the cell body) after expression of the HA-tagged synaptophysin. Did the authors check if the expression levels and/or distribution of other SV proteins were affected?</p><p>7) As with all tagging strategies, the localization of their tagged protein may not be not identical to the endogenous protein. In particular, this applies to the situation where localization in subcellular compartments is beyond standard light microscopy resolution. This could pose a limitation if one is trying to dissect whether there are two types of vesicles that release different neurotransmitters or if two types of neurotransmitter molecules are packaged into one SV, for example. Please comment.</p><p>8) Neuronal culture isolations may introduce contamination since it is difficult not also lyse the soma, potentially resulting in Golgi contamination. Please comment.</p><p>9) The high-salt washes may disrupt membranes. Were such washes applied prior to cryo-TEM imaging (e.g., Figure 1G)? The small densities may be fragments of SVs. Of course, for metabolomics studies, this would not be so important.</p></body></sub-article><sub-article article-type="reply" id="sa2"><front-stub><article-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.59699.sa2</article-id><title-group><article-title>Author response</article-title></title-group></front-stub><body><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Essential revisions:</p><p>1) The authors use complementary mass spectrometry strategies to identify the expected glutamate and GABA in, respectively, excitatory and inhibitory neuron SVs, with no evidence for additional candidate transmitter.

In this work, we only investigated the presence of polar metabolites, and we did not assess whether other metabolite classes such as ions and non-polar compounds are specifically enriched within SVs. For instance, zinc has been proposed to be a neurotransmitter at excitatory synapses but was not detectable by the mass spectrometry methods used in this study. Furthermore, if these candidate neurotransmitters are of low abundance, they may not be detected as our workflow has limitations which stem from both the sensitivity of mass spectrometry combined with the low yields of SVs captured. Finally, in this work we only surveyed a limited subset of neurons in culture and in vivo, and more extensive profiling of other brain regions may reveal the presence of putative neurotransmitters.</p><p>The results presented here provide a groundwork for further studies to adapt the method for compatibility with other MS detection methods and to further improve yields, both of which may lead to the identification of novel neurotransmitters. We have included a statement on this subject in the second paragraph of the Discussion.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>2) With regard to specificity, the authors demonstrate that immunoisolation depends on expression of epitope-tagged synaptophysin, and excludes other organelles such as ER and mitochondria.

We did observe an enrichment of transferrin receptor positive membranes but not GLUT4 positive membranes in our preparations, suggesting that there are dendritic endosomes present. However, the degree of enrichment of these dendritic membranes is much less than for SV membrane markers, as assessed by synaptophysin, synaptotagmin, synaptobrevin, VGLUT1, and SV2A. We have incorporated this finding within the revised text. Improvement in the localization of SV-tag, which, as presented in our manuscript, is mistargeted to the soma and dendrites, may help to alleviate this issue.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>3) Related to the previous point, it is difficult to assess the purity of the final SV fraction.

The analysis is shown in Figure 1—figure supplement 1F. We find that a large fraction of the particles (62%) are in the 40-60 nm range, which is within range of previously reported values for SVs. Approximately 13% of the particles are those larger than 70 nm in diameter, which may be consistent with large dense-core vesicles or unknown contaminating organelles. In addition, there are particles smaller than 40 nm which may represent membrane fragments resulting from high-salt washes performed at the end of the immunoisolation to increase the purity of our SV preps, as noted by reviewer comment #9. We have modified our original discussion of the EM results in the Results section to incorporate these considerations.</p><p>Although immunolabeling and EM imaging would be ideal to confirm the identity of these particles SVs, we are unable to perform these experiments due to the method we use to free the SVs from the HA beads. Because of the use of an HA-tag containing 9 tandem repeats, the affinity of the tag for the HA antibody is too strong to be competed with HA peptide. To free captured SVs from the beads while preserving their structural integrity for EM imaging, we used a cysteine protease (ficin) which cleaves the immunoglobulin chain of the HA antibody under gentle conditions (37°C incubation in a Tris-based buffer) to release SVs. However, ficin also non-specifically cleaves proteins found on the surface of SVs, as determined by immunoblotting, making us unable to immunolabel the particles for EM imaging. This also points to another caveat of this process – cleaving these SV proteins may alter SV morphology and contribute to the variation in particle sizes observed in the EM images.</p><p>To address the specificity of our SV preps, we performed immunoblotting for an expanded set of organellar markers (Figure 1F). We probed for transferrin receptor and GLUT4 to determine if there were dendritic and axonal endosomal membranes present, respectively. We did find a minor degree of dendritic endosome contamination, which we have now noted in the Results. In addition, we profiled for myelin basic protein, Na<sup>+</sup> K<sup>+</sup> ATPase, and CaV2.1 calcium channel but did not find any enrichment of these glial and plasma membranes.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>4) One question not addressed specifically concerns yield.

First, we have indicated the proportion of input (0.4%) and immunoprecipitate (5%) loaded in the SDS-PAGE gel (Figure 1F legend). These proportions were optimized to result in comparable immunoblot signals in the input and immunoprecipitate, as the input has significantly more protein than the immunoprecipitate.</p><p>We also quantified the yield (Figure 1—figure supplement 1G) by calculating how much of the SV material present in the input was captured in the final immunoprecipitate. For these yield calculations, we did not use SV-tag because a large portion of it is mislocalized in the soma and dendrites, and this would lead to an underestimate of yield. Based on three SV proteins – VGLUT1, SV2A, and synaptobrevin – our yields are ~2%, which is consistent with previously developed methods for rapid organellar isolation (Chen et al., 2016). Because our method is focused on speed of isolation to maintain the metabolite content of SVs, we sacrifice yield.</p><p>Another metric to enable comparison of our method to previous ones is the degree of enrichment of SV proteins. Thus, we performed quantitative immunoblotting to assess this and included the results in a new panel (Figure 1H). Our enrichment based on synaptobrevin is 10 fold, which is lower than the 20-23 fold value reported in previous SV isolation methods (Ahmed et al., 2013). Further improvements in the method, such as the use of an endogenous tag to more completely tag SV pools, will be implemented in future studies to improve enrichment.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>5) The value of this study depends on the evidence of improvement over previous methods. Since these were less well documented, it is difficult to know how much of an improvement is achieved by the introduction of an exogenous epitope tag over the use of an endogenous SV protein, but previous work was still able to detect accumulation of glutamate. In light of this question, it is important to document the yield as well as the specificity of the new approach.</p></disp-quote><p>The key advantage of using an exogenous epitope tag vs. an endogenous SV protein is that it can be expressed in genetically defined subpopulations. This enables SV capture from specific cell types from heterogeneous brain tissue and the accurate interrogation of the neurotransmitter profiles of these neurons. We demonstrate this when we express SV-tag in vivo and can determine the neurotransmitter released by cortical, striatal, and dopaminergic neurons. We highlight these advantages in the fourth paragraph of the Introduction and in the first paragraph of the Results.</p><p>To address the issues of specificity, we performed an expanded immunoblot analysis and probed for the presence of axonal and dendritic endosomes, glial membranes, and plasma membranes, in addition to previously profiled cellular compartments (Golgi, ER, cytosol, post-synaptic membrane, lysosome). With the exception of a small degree of contamination with dendritic endosomal membrane as indicated by transferrin receptor, our preps are highly specific for SV proteins (Figure 1F). We also documented yield (Figure 1—figure supplement 1G) by calculating the percent of SV protein input that was present in the final isolate. It is low, in the 2% range, which is expected given that our method is optimized for much more rapid capture compared to previous ones. This tradeoff is necessary as our main goal is to preserve the integrity of the metabolite contents of SVs.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>6) Based on the microscopic images (Figure 1D and E and Figure 1—figure supplement 1), synapsin seems differently distributed (especially in the cell body) after expression of the HA-tagged synaptophysin. Did the authors check if the expression levels and/or distribution of other SV proteins were affected?</p></disp-quote><p>We have included a more representative image of synapsin in uninfected cortical neurons (Figure 1D and E) which indicates that the expression levels and distribution are comparable in infected and uninfected neurons. Furthermore, we have included an additional stain for bassoon, another presynaptic bouton marker (Figure 1—figure supplement 1A) to demonstrate that its localization is also comparable in both uninfected and SV-tag infected neurons.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>7) As with all tagging strategies, the localization of their tagged protein may not be not identical to the endogenous protein.

Please comment.</p></disp-quote><p>Due to the use of an ectopic overexpressed tag, our method is unable to distinguish between these possibilities of corelease. We can only capture the entire SV pool within neurons rather than subclasses. Our method will enable an investigator to establish whether neurons of interest coexpress multiple neurotransmitters. Follow up studies with higher resolution techniques will be necessary to address the nature of this corelease, such as array tomography or immunolabelling with EM imaging. We have included this statement in the fourth paragraph of the Discussion.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>8) Neuronal culture isolations may introduce contamination since it is difficult not also lyse the soma, potentially resulting in Golgi contamination. Please comment.</p></disp-quote><p>We stained for Golgin-97, a protein marker for golgi membranes, and did not observe enrichment of this protein in our final SV preps (Figure 1F).

We have mentioned this caveat in the fourth paragraph of the Results. In future studies, we will pursue alternative methods to increase the specificity of our capture and minimize the need for these washes. This includes improving the localization of SV-tag, as mistargeting leads to increased non-specific capture and the requirement for harsh washes.</p></body></sub-article></article>
