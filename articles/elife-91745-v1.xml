While coronaviruses are especially prone to induce pandemics, we know little about their evolutionary history, host-to-host transmissions, and biogeography. One of the difficulties lies in dating the origination of the family, a particularly challenging task for RNA viruses in general. Previous cophylogenetic tests of virus-host associations, including in the Coronaviridae family, have suggested a virus-host codiversification history stretching many millions of years. Here, we establish a framework for robustly testing scenarios of ancient origination and codiversification <italic>versus</italic> recent origination and diversification by host switches. Applied to coronaviruses and their mammalian hosts, our results support a scenario of recent origination of coronaviruses in bats and diversification by host switches, with preferential host switches within mammalian orders. Hotspots of coronavirus diversity, concentrated in East Asia and Europe, are consistent with this scenario of relatively recent origination and localized host switches. Spillovers from bats to other species are rare, but have the highest probability to be towards humans than to any other mammal species, implicating humans as the evolutionary intermediate host. The high host-switching rates within orders, as well as between humans, domesticated mammals, and non-flying wild mammals, indicates the potential for rapid additional spreading of coronaviruses across the world. Our results suggest that the evolutionary history of extant mammalian coronaviruses is recent, and that cases of long-term virus–host codiversification have been largely over-estimated.</p></abstract><abstract abstract-type="plain-language-summary"><title>eLife digest</title><p>The SARS-CoV-2 virus, which caused the recent global coronavirus pandemic, is the latest in a string of coronaviruses that have caused serious outbreaks. This group of coronaviruses can also infect other mammals and likely jumped between species – including from non-humans to humans – over the course of evolution.</p><p>Determining when and how viruses evolved to infect humans can help scientists predict and prevent outbreaks. However, tracking the evolutionary trajectory of coronaviruses is challenging, and there are conflicting views on how often coronaviruses crossed between species and when these transitions likely occurred. Some studies suggest that coronaviruses originated early on in evolution and evolved together with their mammalian hosts, only occasionally jumping to and from different species. While others suggest they appeared more recently, and rapidly diversified by regularly transferring between species.</p><p>To determine which is the most likely scenario, Maestri, Perez-Lamarque et al. developed a computational approach using already available data on the genetics and evolutionary history of mammals and coronaviruses. This revealed that coronaviruses originated recently in bats from East Asia and Europe, and primarily evolved by rapidly transferring between different mammalian species. This has led to geographical hotspots of diverse coronaviruses in East Asia and Europe.</p><p>Maestri, Perez-Lamarque et al. found that it was rare for coronaviruses to spill over from bats to other types of mammals. Most of these spillovers resulted from coronaviruses jumping from bats to humans or domesticated animals. Humans appeared to be the main intermediary host that coronaviruses temporarily infected as they transferred from bats to other mammals.</p><p>These findings – that coronaviruses emerged recently in evolution, jumped relatively frequently between species, and are geographically restricted – suggest that future transmissions are likely. Gathering more coronavirus samples from across the world and using even more powerful analysis tools could help scientists understand more about how these viruses recently evolved. These insights may lead to strategies for preventing new coronaviruses from emerging and spreading among humans.</p></abstract><kwd-group kwd-group-type="author-keywords"><kwd>coronavirus evolution</kwd><kwd>diversity of coronaviruses</kwd><kwd>preferential host switching</kwd><kwd>parasite diversification</kwd><kwd>codiversification</kwd><kwd>coevolution</kwd></kwd-group><kwd-group kwd-group-type="research-organism"><title>Research organism</title><kwd>Human</kwd><kwd>Other</kwd><kwd>Virus</kwd></kwd-group><funding-group><award-group id="fund1"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution>GENCI-IDRIS</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>2021-A0100312405</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Perez-Lamarque</surname><given-names>Benoît</given-names></name><name><surname>Morlon</surname><given-names>Hélène</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund2"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution>GENCI-IDRIS</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>2022-AD010313735</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Perez-Lamarque</surname><given-names>Benoît</given-names></name><name><surname>Morlon</surname><given-names>Hélène</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund3"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution>One Health/Make Our Planet Great Again Program</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>3--5017338047</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Maestri</surname><given-names>Renan</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><funding-statement>The funders had no role in study design, data collection and interpretation, or the decision to submit the work for publication.</funding-statement></funding-group><custom-meta-group><custom-meta specific-use="meta-only"><meta-name>Author impact statement</meta-name><meta-value>The common ancestor of extant mammalian coronaviruses originated recently in a bat species and their diversification occurred via preferential host switches rather than through codiversification with mammals.</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta specific-use="meta-only"><meta-name>publishing-route</meta-name><meta-value>prc</meta-value></custom-meta></custom-meta-group></article-meta></front><body><sec id="s1" sec-type="intro"><title>Introduction</title><p>Coronaviruses are RNA-viruses of the family Coronaviridae, comprising positive-sense and single-stranded viruses that have the largest genomes among nidoviruses (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Alekseev et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">De Groot, 2022</xref>).

The latter is at the origin of the recent COVID-19 pandemic that infected more than 775 million people and caused the death of more than seven million (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib69">Ritchie, 2024</xref>). Coronaviruses’ high frequency of recombination (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib88">Woo et al., 2010</xref>), broad host range, and high mutation rates (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Becker et al., 2022</xref>) make them especially prone to causing yet future diseases. Nevertheless, their evolutionary history and biogeography are very poorly understood. Resolving the evolutionary origins of Coronaviridae, understanding how they diversified, and characterizing their geographic diversity patterns would facilitate attempts to predict future zoonoses (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Becker et al., 2022</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Anthony et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib52">Munoz, 2022</xref>).</p><p>Coronaviruses infect mammals, birds, and fishes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">De Groot, 2022</xref>), although they predominate in mammalian species (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">Guan et al., 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Chinese SARS Molecular Epidemiology Consortium, 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">Graham and Baric, 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">de Groot et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Corman et al., 2018</xref>). A consensus exists on the taxonomic segregation of four genera within Coronaviridae: Orthocoronavirinae, namely Alpha-, Beta-, Gamma- and Deltacoronavirus (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">De Groot, 2022</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib49">Mavrodiev et al., 2020</xref>). Alpha- and betacoronaviruses are found exclusively in mammals, while delta- and gammacoronaviruses infect mostly birds but also mammals to a lesser extent (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Corman et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib87">Woo et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib89">Woo et al., 2012</xref>). Coronaviruses are most numerous and genetically diversified in mammals (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">De Groot, 2022</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib89">Woo et al., 2012</xref>), in particular bats, suggesting a mammalian origin in bats (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">De Groot, 2022</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Corman et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib89">Woo et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib81">Vijaykrishna et al., 2007</xref>), although this remains to be tested.</p><p>The timing of origination of the Coronaviridae family is debated, with results that vary by several orders of magnitude. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib89">Woo et al., 2012</xref> found a recent origin, around 10 thousand years ago. This dating was obtained by sequencing the well-conserved RNA-dependent RNA-polymerase (RdRp) genome region of representatives of all four coronavirus genera, and fitting to these sequences a neutral nucleotide-based substitution model with an uncorrelated log-normal relaxed clock (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Drummond et al., 2006</xref>) calibrated with serial samples. This calibration provided a mean substitution rate estimate of 1.3x10–4 substitutions per site per year. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib86">Wertheim et al., 2013</xref> used this estimate and the same genome region (RdRp), but with a codon-based substitution model accounting for the effect of selection. Indeed, purifying selection can lead to an underestimation of viral origins when not accounted for (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib86">Wertheim et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib85">Wertheim and Kosakovsky Pond, 2011</xref>). They found an ancient origin, around 293 (95% confidence interval, 190–489) million years ago (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib86">Wertheim et al., 2013</xref>). More recently, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">Hayman and Knox, 2021</xref> obtained similar results, but using the splitting times of hosts as constraints, therefore assuming a priori that coronaviruses codiversified with their hosts.</p><p>More generally, dating the phylogenies of RNA virus families is a difficult task (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Duchêne et al., 2014</xref>). While for some of them dated calibration points can be used, based on orthologous copies of endogenous virus elements (EVEs) present in the genomes of related mammalian species with known times of divergence (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">Katzourakis and Gifford, 2010</xref>), in many others, including in the Coronaviridae, such elements have not been found (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib71">Shi et al., 2018</xref>). Despite the difficulty in dating viral families, it has been proposed, from cophylogenetic analyses investigating the congruence of the host and viral phylogenetic trees (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Conow et al., 2010</xref>), that vertebrate-associated RNA viruses have codiversified with their hosts over hundreds of millions of years (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib71">Shi et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib91">Zhang et al., 2018</xref>; but see <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Geoghegan et al., 2017</xref>; see <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="supp1">Supplementary file 1a</xref> for a clarification of out terminology). Indeed, RNA virus phylogenies tend to mirror that of their hosts; for example, closely-related coronaviruses infect closely-related mammals (e.g. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">Hayman and Knox, 2021</xref>). However, a major caveat is that such cophylogenetic signals can emerge when viruses diversify by host switches preferentially occurring among closely-related hosts, in the absence of any cospeciation event (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">de Vienne et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib62">Perez-Lamarque and Morlon, 2024</xref>).</p><p>Event-based cophylogenetic methods can in principle identify cospeciation and host switches events (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Conow et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">de Vienne et al., 2013</xref>), but their behavior in the presence of diversification by preferential host switches is not well understood. Under a perfect codiversification scenario, host and symbiont phylogenies would be identical. Events of host switches, duplications and losses induce mismatches, and cophylogenetic methods aim to identify parsimonious sets of events that allow ‘reconciling’ the two phylogenies (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">de Vienne et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib60">Perez-Lamarque and Morlon, 2022</xref>). However, most of these methods rely entirely on tree topology (and not branching times), such that time-inconsistent host switches between non-contemporary host lineages are allowed during the reconciliation. In the presence of preferential host switches, these methods may thus favor biologically unrealistic reconciliations that involve cospeciation events and ‘back-in-time’ host switches to reconciliations that involve more frequent contemporary host switches. This would have remained unnoticed, unless users of the methods specifically looked at the time consistency of the inferred host switches, which is usually not done.</p><p>Here, we establish a framework for testing scenarios of ancient origination and codiversification versus recent origination and diversification by host switches that combines probabilistic cophylogenetic models and biogeographic analyses (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1</xref>). We then apply this framework to the Coronaviridae-mammals association. We assemble a dataset of all mammalian hosts of coronaviruses and a complete association matrix between host species and species-like Operational Taxonomic Units (sOTUs) of coronaviruses, as well as geographic repartition of Coronaviridae and their mammalian hosts. We construct a new Coronaviridae tree based on a recent proposition for the use of a well-conserved region of their RNA genome (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Edgar et al., 2022</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Babaian and Edgar, 2022</xref>). Under the ancient origination scenario (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1A</xref>), long-term vertical transmission of Coronaviridae within mammalian lineages could lead to events of mammal-coronavirus cospeciations. Coronaviruses’ diversification would then be modulated by both cospeciations and horizontal host switches from one mammalian lineage to another (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib86">Wertheim et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib71">Shi et al., 2018</xref>). The most recent common ancestor of coronaviruses could even have infected the most recent common ancestor of mammals and birds (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib86">Wertheim et al., 2013</xref>). Under the recent origination scenario (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1B</xref>), codiversification with hosts is virtually impossible, and coronaviruses’ diversification would then be largely dominated by recent host switches. Expectations for the output of reconciliation and biogeographic analyses under these different scenarios, as well as a scenario of random associations, are explained in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1</xref>. We identify the likely origination of coronaviruses in the mammalian tree, quantify the frequency of cospeciation and host-switching events, and locate these host switches, therefore identifying ‘reservoirs’ of Coronaviridae and potential transmission routes across mammals.</p><fig id="fig1" position="float"><label>Figure 1.</label><caption><title>A framework for testing scenarios of virus-host evolution, illustrated with the example of Coronaviridae and their mammalian hosts.</title><p>In (<bold>A</bold>), a scenario of ancient origination and codiversification; in (<bold>B</bold>) a scenario of recent origination and diversification by preferential host switches; and in (<bold>C</bold>) a scenario of independent evolution. For each scenario, we indicate the associated predictions in the grey boxes. Contrary to scenario C, both scenarios A and B are expected to generate a cophylogenetic signal, <italic>i.e</italic>. closely-related coronaviruses tend to infect closely-related mammals, resulting in significant reconciliations when using topology-based probabilistic cophylogenetic methods, such as the undated version of ALE, Jane, or eMPRess. However, we expect scenario B to be distinguishable from scenario A in terms of the time consistency of host-switching events. Under scenario B, cophylogenetic methods wrongly estimate a combination of cospeciations and ‘back-in-time’ host switches (see Materials and methods and Results). We also expect different biogeographic patterns under the different scenarios, as illustrated by the maps, where the color gradient represents diversity levels (red: high diversity, grey: low diversity).</p></caption><graphic mimetype="image" mime-subtype="tiff" xlink:href="elife-91745-fig1-v1.tif"/></fig></sec><sec id="s2" sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><sec id="s2-1"><title>Mammal-coronavirus associations</title><p>By screening the 46 sOTUs of Coronaviridae identified by <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Edgar et al., 2022</xref> in public databases, we found 35 that were associated with mammalian hosts.

Most mammalian hosts are bats (Chiroptera - 55 species), followed by rodents (Rodentia - 22 species), artiodactyls (Artiodactyla - 15 species), carnivores (Carnivora - 11 species), and primates (Primates - 5 species).

To the contrary, we found a significant phylogenetic signal for the overall association between coronaviruses and mammals (Mantel test: <italic>r</italic>=0.38; p=0.0001) and vice-versa (<italic>r</italic>=0.29; p=0.0001), after accounting for the confounding phylogenetic signal in the number of partners (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib59">Perez-Lamarque et al., 2022b</xref>).

The main version of ALE we used is an ‘undated’ version that accounts for topology but not branch lengths, as the dated version did not perform well on our data (see Materials and methods). Time-inconsistent host switches are thus allowed during the reconciliation. If the scenario of ancient diversification holds, we expect to find reconciliations requiring more cospeciations and fewer host switches than expected under a scenario of independent evolution (hereafter referred to as ‘significant reconciliation’), and few time-inconsistent switches (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1A</xref>). Under the alternative scenario of recent origination and diversification by preferential host switches, we also expect to infer a significant reconciliation, but with many time-inconsistent switches, as the algorithm tends to explain the cophylogenetic signal in the interactions by cospeciation events (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1B</xref>). We indeed found a significant reconciliation between the Coronaviridae and the mammalian trees, confirming the non-independence of their evolution, which we evaluated by randomly shuffling mammal species across the full tree or within biogeographic regions (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s1">Figure 4—figure supplement 1</xref>). ALE reconciliations inferred average numbers of 145 cospeciations, 65 losses, 0 duplication, and 92 host switches. Without investigating the time-consistency of the host switches, we would conclude that there are almost 1.5 more diversification events of Coronaviridae that are related to ancient codiversification rather than host switches. However, on average 20% of the inferred host switches are time-inconsistent, including ‘back-in-time’ host switches of &gt;50 Myr (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s2">Figure 4—figure supplement 2</xref>). Similar results were observed when accounting for the uncertainty in the branching time estimates (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s2">Figure 4—figure supplement 2</xref>), which suggests instead that extant Coronaviridae originated recently and diversified by frequent preferential host switches.</p><p>The majority (64%) of the reconciliations found an origination of coronaviruses within bats, in particular within the Pteropodidae family (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4A–C</xref>).

We checked the interpretation of our results by simulating the two scenarios of (i) ancient origination in the ancestors of bats followed by codiversification and (ii) recent origination in an extant bat species and a subsequent diversification by preferential host switches. On the first set of simulations, ALE correctly inferred an origination in bats and very few time-inconsistent switches (2% +/- 2%), which seems to be the basal expected proportion of time-inconsistent switches under a scenario of codiversification (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s5">Figure 4—figure supplement 5</xref>). On the second set, ALE correctly inferred an origination in bats, although with lower confidence, and a large fraction (~20%) of time-inconsistent host switches, similar to what we observed for Coronaviridae. These results therefore indicate a scenario of recent origination of coronaviruses in bats followed by diversification by preferential host switches.</p><fig-group><fig id="fig4" position="float"><label>Figure 4.</label><caption><title>The origination of coronaviruses in mammals is estimated among bats, which tend to form a closed reservoir.</title><p>(<bold>A</bold>) Phylogenetic tree of the mammals with branches colored as the percentage of ALE reconciliations which inferred this branch or its ancestral lineages as the origination of coronaviruses in mammals.

We thus carried out our follow-up analyses with a mammals’ tree transformation (star phylogeny) that assumes an origination in an extant mammalian lineage, such that coronavirus diversification is explained entirely by host switches between extant mammalian species. Simulations validated this approach in terms of properly inferring originations and identifying preferential host switches (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s6">Figure 4—figure supplement 6</xref>). Applied to the data, the approach inferred a high probability of origination in bats (56%, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4B-C</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s4">Figure 4—figure supplement 4</xref>), far more likely than in other mammalian orders (artiodactyls: 18%, rodents: 7%, carnivores: 5%).

We also inferred more-than-expected host switches between closely related mammal orders (e.g. between Artiodactyla and Perissodactyla) and between the order containing humans (Primates) and those of their domesticated animals, such as Artiodactyla and Carnivora (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s8">Figure 4—figure supplement 8</xref>, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="supp1">Supplementary file 1c</xref>). In contrast, host switches were five times less numerous than expected by chance between bats and other orders (10.7%, against 50.2% on average if host switches were randomly distributed, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4D</xref>), in particular Artiodactyla and Rodentia (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s9">Figure 4—figure supplement 9</xref>, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="supp1">Supplementary file 1c</xref>). When occurring, host switches from bats often occurred toward humans (1.9 host switches per reconciliation on average) or toward urban-living and/or domesticated animals, such as rats, camels, or pigs (&gt;1 host switch on average; <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="supp1">Supplementary file 1d</xref>). Host switches to humans occurred mostly from domesticated mammals (camels, pigs, dogs), the house shrew and the house mouse, then followed by Asian palm civets, and lastly by bats and other rodents (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="supp1">Supplementary file 1e</xref>). Finally, we found that some sOTUs, in particular from betacoronaviruses (e.g. u24667 and u175, both with humans among their hosts), have experienced frequent host switches, whereas others have not (e.g. u165, which is restricted to pigs). In particular, u944 (SARS-Cov-2) has experienced an intermediate number of host switches compared to other coronaviruses (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s10">Figure 4—figure supplement 10</xref>).</p><p>We also separately investigated the diversification dynamics of the two main clades of coronaviruses: the alpha- and betacoronaviruses. The undated version of ALE inferred, in alphacoronaviruses, 64 cospeciations, 0 duplication, 35 host switches, and 25 losses, as well as a recent origination in bats (69% of the reconciliations) and frequent intra-order host switches (80%). In contrast, in betacoronaviruses, a majority of the reconciliations (76%) had an origination in mammalian orders other than bats, including rodents (25%), Artiodactyla (18%), or Carnivora (13%), and involved inter-order host switches (61%). These results suggest that the ancestral coronavirus originated in bats, gave rise to alphacoronaviruses in bats, and switched to a different non-bat host where it evolved into betacoronaviruses. With 80 cospeciations, 0 duplication, 50 switches, and 36 losses, the fraction of host switches relative to cospeciation events is higher in betacoranaviruses (0.63) than in alphacoronaviruses (0.54). In both clades, host switches from bats still occurred preferentially toward humans or domesticated mammals, and &gt;15% of the switches were time inconsistent. The dated version of ALE that forces host switches to be time-consistent failed to output a reconciliation for betacoronaviruses; in alphacoronaviruses, we obtained significant reconciliations with more ‘mismatch’ events (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib67">R Development Core Team, 2018</xref>, including 38 host switches and 29 losses) than cospeciation events (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Bouckaert et al., 2014</xref>), suggesting cophylogenetic signal without phylogenetic congruence (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="supp1">Supplementary file 1a</xref>; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib62">Perez-Lamarque and Morlon, 2024</xref>).

We also obtained consistent results using a reconciliation method based on maximum parsimony (eMPRess) instead of maximum likelihood (ALE). Whatever the costs that we set for the different reconciliation events, eMPRess estimated significant reconciliations (p&lt;0.01). For instance, when favoring host switches, we inferred a recent origination in bats in 54% of the reconciliations and observed on average 32 cospeciations (s.d. +/-3), 2 losses (s.d. +/-1), 0.1 duplication (s.d. +/-0.3), and 140 host switches (s.d. +/-3) including several ‘back-in-time’ host switches of &gt;30 Myr. eMPRess therefore also supports a scenario of recent origination in bats and diversification by preferential host switches (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1B</xref>).

When randomly subsampling only three Genbank accession codes per host species, we still found frequent originations in bats (59%+/-s.d. 5%), preferential host switches (48%+/-s.d. 5%), and frequent transfers from bats to humans (in 90% of the subsampled dataset) or domesticated animals (e.g. <italic>Sus scrofa</italic> and <italic>Camelus dromedarius</italic> in 100% and 52% of the subsampled dataset, respectively). Second, we tested the effect of unequal sampling effort across the mammal tree of life. When randomly subsampling up to 10 species per mammalian order, we observed an average decrease in the probability of origination in bats (from 56% in the original dataset to 37%+/-s.d. 10%), yet this scenario remained much more likely than an origination in other mammalian orders, such as artiodactyls (14%+/-s.d. 4%), rodents (11%+/-s.d. 3%), or carnivores (10%+/-s.d. 2%). Transfers from bats still occurred more frequently toward humans or domesticated mammals (<italic>Camelus dromedarius</italic>, <italic>Rattus norvegicus</italic>, or <italic>Sus scrofa</italic>): along with <italic>Sorex araneus</italic>, these species were in the top 5 of the species receiving a coronavirus from bats<italic>ffing. Overall, these sensitivity analyses</italic> indicate that the likely origination in bats and the frequent transfers from bats to humans or domesticated animals is not artifactually driven by the high number of bats species in the dataset nor the enhanced monitoring of coronaviruses in humans or domesticated animals.</p></sec><sec id="s2-5"><title>Geographical distribution of coronaviruses</title><p>An additional piece of evidence for a recent origination scenario comes from the geographical distribution of coronaviruses, with a hotspot of diversity in Eurasia that has not colonized the whole world (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5A</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1B</xref>).

Although we cannot unequivocally date the timing of origination of coronaviruses in mammals, we demonstrate that Coronaviridae is a highly dynamic clade in which diversification operates through host switches at a much faster pace than that of their hosts. sOTUs are rapidly replaced by newly generated ones, with little role for codiversification with the hosts. The high diversity and endemicity of coronaviruses among bats have led others to anticipate that bats might be implicated in the origin of coronaviruses (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">De Groot, 2022</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Corman et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib89">Woo et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib81">Vijaykrishna et al., 2007</xref>), although definitive proof was lacking. We provided evidence for that hypothesis using a probabilistic cophylogenetic model and accounting for the entire known diversity of coronaviruses across mammals. Independent evidence for coronavirus recent host switches among different species exists in the literature (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Dudas et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib84">Wei et al., 2021</xref>). The envisioned scenario suggests a timing of origination for extant Coronaviridae that is much more recent than the hundreds of millions of years ago suggested by <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib86">Wertheim et al., 2013</xref>. This is not surprising given the difficulties in estimating divergence times and inferring branch lengths for viral phylogenies (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib86">Wertheim et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib85">Wertheim and Kosakovsky Pond, 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Duchêne et al., 2014</xref>), and provided that the dating of <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib86">Wertheim et al., 2013</xref> relied on a substitution rate estimated from data with limited temporal signal (~50 serially sampled contemporary sequences of a short gene fragment, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib89">Woo et al., 2012</xref>).</p><p>Our results contradict previous suggestions that codiversification with vertebrate hosts played an important role in Coronaviridae diversification (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib86">Wertheim et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">Hayman and Knox, 2021</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib71">Shi et al., 2018</xref>). They also suggest that previously reported cases of long-term codiversification in vertebrate RNA viruses have been largely over-estimated, as many of them may instead be cases of diversification by host switches occurring preferentially among closely related hosts (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Geoghegan et al., 2017</xref>). Indeed, these two scenarios both generate cophylogenetic signal in host-symbionts associations, such that cophylogenetic signal alone is not evidence for long-term codiversification (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">de Vienne et al., 2013</xref>). In addition, under a scenario of recent origination and preferential host switches, event-based cophylogenetic methods tend to artifactually favor biologically unrealistic scenarios with codiversification and back-in-time host switches, as we have shown here. As the time-consistency of host switches is typically not investigated, this has remained unnoticed, and evidence for codiversification has been taken for real. Ideally, cophylogenetic reconciliation methods would not allow such time-inconsistent host switches. However, imposing time constraints in methods based on parsimony is NP-hard (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib70">Santichaivekin et al., 2021</xref>), and the ‘dated’ version of ALE is not well adapted when recent host switch events dominate evolutionary history. We have found two ways to get around the problem, by interpreting time-inconsistent host switches as evidence for recent preferential host switches, and by gradually transforming the host tree to avoid large back-in-time switches, however future efforts should focus on developing time-consistent cophylogenetic methods. This would allow more robust and precise inferences of host-virus (and more generally host-symbiont) evolutionary history. We have shown by simulation that contrasting scenarios, such as codiversification, or diversification by preferential host switching after originating within or outside bats, leave distinct signatures in the data. This suggests that deep neural networks trained on simulated data, which have already shown their performance in phylodynamics (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib41">Lajaaiti et al., 2023</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib76">Thompson et al., 2023</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib82">Voznica et al., 2022</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib42">Lambert et al., 2023</xref>), could also be useful for the analysis of cophylogenetic data.</p></sec><sec id="s3-2"><title>Host switching dynamics in coronaviridae</title><p>During their evolution, coronavirus’ host switches occurred more frequently within than between mammalian orders. This suggests that mammalian characteristics shared between relatives (e.g. genetic, behavioral, ecological), and the frequency of encounters among hosts play important roles in determining coronavirus’ host switches. Additionally, between-order host switches occurred more frequently among non-flying mammals and among orders containing humans and urban and domesticated mammals, suggesting that contact frequency alone is likely a key characteristic in host switches. Accordingly, amongst the most-likely host switches towards humans were those coming from mammals suspected to be involved in the transfer of specific coronavirus sOTUs likely through contact, for instance, camels in the case of MERS-CoV (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Dudas et al., 2018</xref>), Asian palm civets with SARS-CoV (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">Guan et al., 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Chinese SARS Molecular Epidemiology Consortium, 2004</xref>) and the house mouse with SARS-CoV-2 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib84">Wei et al., 2021</xref>). Importantly, we found that host switches from bats to other mammalian species were rare during the evolutionary history of Coronaviridae, even though coronaviruses originated and are more diverse within bats. These pieces of evidences suggest that bats are a closed reservoir of the Coronaviridae diversity, as also suggested by their relative isolation in the mammal-coronaviruses interaction network (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3</xref>).</p><p>Spillovers from bats to non-bat species, when they occurred, were found more likely to be towards humans than to any other mammalian species, suggesting humans may have acted as evolutionary intermediate hosts amongst mammals, in line with their centrality in the mammal-coronaviruses interaction network (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3</xref>). From an ecological perspective, the large abundance and widespread geographic distribution of humans, together with our habits of forcing contact with other species, including bats, make it unsurprising that humans, among all mammal species, have acted as intermediate hosts of ancestral forms of coronaviruses. Interestingly, for some individual species of coronaviruses, such as the SARS-CoV2 and other SARS-like coronaviruses, the dominant hypothesized scenario is that precursor forms spread from a bat to another intermediate mammalian host before infecting humans (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Corman et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib75">Tan et al., 2022</xref>). Our molecular marker lacks the intra-I resolution necessary to make species-level predictions, but our results suggest that more ancient coronaviruses host switches may have occurred in the other direction: from bats to humans to non-bat mammals. The large spillover of SARS-CoV2 from humans to wild mammalian lineages has now been well documented (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib75">Tan et al., 2022</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Goldberg, 2023</xref>) and tend to confirm our results of humans as the intermediate host. Many human activities lend credit to the human-as-evolutionarily-intermediate-host-hypothesis, including human excursions to bat caves (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Furey and Racey, 2016</xref>), hunting (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib50">Mildenstein et al., 2016</xref>), and habitat destruction and modification (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib72">Smith and Wang, 2013</xref>), all of which increase the contact between bats and humans and their domesticated animals (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib72">Smith and Wang, 2013</xref>). Conservation of bats’ natural habitats, away from human contact, could help avoiding further spreads of coronaviruses among humans.</p><p>In agreement with previous studies <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">De Groot, 2022</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib49">Mavrodiev et al., 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib87">Woo et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib89">Woo et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib81">Vijaykrishna et al., 2007</xref>,), we found noticeable differences between Alpha- and Betacoronaviruses. While Alphacoronaviruses likely originated in bats and mostly diversified by switching between bat lineages, betacoronaviruses most likely originated in a non-bat lineage and experienced a majority of their host switches between non-bat mammals. In addition, our findings suggest that host switching rates are higher in betacoronaviruses than in alphacoronaviruses. These different host switching dynamics are consistent with biogeographical differences: betacoronaviruses tend to be more geographically spread than alphacoronaviruses, which are more restricted to Eurasia. Some of the trends we observed (e.g. the higher host switching rates in betacoronaviruses) are not consistent with previous findings (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Caraballo, 2022</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib44">Latinne et al., 2020</xref>, however these results are not directly comparable, as studies were conducted at very different scales (across the Americas <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Caraballo, 2022</xref>, across China <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib44">Latinne et al., 2020</xref>, and here at the global scale).</p><p>Insights of past and future host switches are gained from coronavirus geographic distribution. Coronaviruses are found worldwide and their hotspots of diversity are concentrated in East Asia and Southern Europe, where they likely originated. Previous assessments of the diversity of bat hosts of betacoronaviruses suggested similar hotspots but with a distribution of coronaviruses more concentrated in the hotspots (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Becker et al., 2022</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Anthony et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib52">Munoz, 2022</xref>) than the more pervasive pattern we found using all mammalian hosts. Moreover, the distribution of coronaviruses is less concentrated in the hotspots when phylogenetic metrics of diversity are included, suggesting that species richness alone is masking the global evolutionary potential of these viruses (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib46">Leopardi et al., 2018</xref>). Coronaviruses’ likely recent origination in bats, high within-order transmission rates, and their capacity to switch between mammal orders in some cases suggest the potential for future fast spreading and increase in the number of species across most world regions. Among alphacoronaviruses, the spread is more likely to remain concentrated within bats, while betacoronaviruses have a higher potential for among-orders spreading and infection of new mammalian hosts. The betacoronaviruses lineages already detected in humans are host generalists with high transmission rates, suggesting that continued monitoring may be wise in mitigating potential future pandemics.</p></sec><sec id="s3-3"><title>Limitations and perspectives</title><p>A few important limitations of our analyses deserve to be mentioned. First, we used a short marker gene to reconstruct the Coronaviridae phylogeny. However, the RdRp palmprint marker we used is very conserved and therefore routinely used for delimiting operational taxonomic units in RNA viruses and reconstructing their evolutionary history (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Edgar et al., 2022</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Babaian and Edgar, 2022</xref>). Our tree has an identical genus-level topology compared with trees constructed using other genome regions, such as the nucleocapsid portion of the coronavirus genome (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib89">Woo et al., 2012</xref>), and very close topologies were also observed using other genome regions such as the spike, envelope, and membrane regions (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib89">Woo et al., 2012</xref>), as well as the entire RdRp region (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">De Groot, 2022</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib93">Zmasek et al., 2022</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib89">Woo et al., 2012</xref>): it differs only on the placement of Gammacoronavirus and Deltacoronavirus in relation to the others, but it is consistent in the monophyly of both Alphacoronavirus and Betacoronavirus and recovers the sister-clade relationship between Gamma and Delta. In addition, because the palmprint region is a conserved region, we could not reconstruct the recent evolutionary history of coronaviruses (i.e. the within sOTU transmission dynamic). Combining the palmprint region with a fast-evolving region(s) would enable more precise estimates of the recent routes of coronaviruses’ transmission, including that of SARS-CoV-2. More generally, characterizing multiple genetic regions with different evolutionary rates across Coronaviridae would allow us to more precisely elucidate the timescale of the evolutionary history of coronaviruses alongside their hosts.</p><p>Second, recombination is an important mechanism of viral evolution (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib63">Pérez-Losada et al., 2015</xref>), and approaches more adequately designed to investigate the role of recombination are needed. The fact that different subparts of the palmprint region lead to similar results indicates that recombination acting on the palmprint region is unlikely to bias our conclusions. However, looking at other genomic regions would allow gaining a more complete understanding of the role of recombination in coronavirus evolution.</p><p>Third, the record of associations between coronaviruses and mammals is necessarily incomplete (not all mammal species have been screened for coronaviruses) and likely biased towards bats and mammals that are in contacts with humans. This a common bias when studying mammal-virus associations that may cause various issues (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib64">Poisot et al., 2023</xref>). However, our sub-sampling analyses suggest that our main results (recent origination in bats and frequent transfer from human-associated mammals to humans) are not artifactually driven by sampling biases. ALE explicitly accounts for undersampling by assuming that host switches involve unsampled intermediate hosts, which may explain the robustness of our findings to sampling biases.</p></sec><sec id="s3-4"><title>Concluding remarks</title><p>Understanding the evolutionary origins and diversification of viruses is useful for predicting new transmission routes, yet the relative frequencies of virus–host cospeciation versus cross-species transmission in the evolution of vertebrate RNA viruses remains uncertain (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib71">Shi et al., 2018</xref>). We found that coronaviruses originated in bats where they are more diverse nowadays, and later diversified in other mammal orders through preferential host switches. Spillovers from bats were rare but likely human-induced, suggesting humans are the intermediate evolutionary bridge that facilitated the spread of coronaviruses across mammals. Host switches between primates and artiodactyls, perissodactyls, and carnivorans occur frequently. This suggests a potential for the spread of coronaviruses to new mammalian hosts beyond their current prevalence in East Asia and Europe, and raises concerns about the possibility of future pandemics related to coronaviruses. Our results indicate that reducing human-bat contact, for instance through the conservation of bat habitats, could potentially serve as a mitigation strategy. They also suggest that cases of long-term virus–host codiversification, reported on the basis of cophylogenetic tests, have been largely over-estimated.</p></sec></sec><sec id="s4" sec-type="materials|methods"><title>Materials and methods</title><sec id="s4-1"><title>Operational taxonomic units for coronaviridae</title><p>Viral species delimitation is difficult (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">Gorbalenya et al., 2020</xref>), and the number of proposed and/or estimated species or strains of Coronaviridae in the literature have varied (e.g. 100 proposed - 3204 estimated <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Anthony et al., 2017</xref>; 88 proposed - 204 estimated <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib83">Wardeh et al., 2021</xref>).

We downloaded the node-dated tree for 4098 mammals, constructed based on a 31-gene supermatrix, from the VertLife website (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://vertlife.org/data/mammals/">http://vertlife.org/data/mammals/</ext-link>). We used a pruned version of the tree with the 116 mammalian hosts of Coronaviridae in all analyses in this paper. We kept for each node the 95% credible interval of its age estimate.</p></sec><sec id="s4-5"><title>Phylogenetic signal in the association between coronaviruses and mammals</title><p>To assess whether closely related coronaviruses interact with similar mammals, and vice-versa, i.e. presence of phylogenetic signal in the association, we used Mantel tests following <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib59">Perez-Lamarque et al., 2022b</xref>. Mantel tests were constructed by taking the Pearson correlation between phylogenetic distances and ecological distances. Phylogenetic distances of coronaviruses were computed on the BEAST2 MCC phylogeny. Ecological distances were calculated based on the interaction network matrix containing the association between coronavirus’ sOTUs and mammals, accounting for the evolutionary relationships among interaction partners using UniFrac distances (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Chen et al., 2012</xref>). Firstly, we conducted Mantel tests permuting the identity of species but keeping the number of partners per species constant; this allows for assessing the effect of species identity while controlling for the confounding effect of the number of partners. Then, we evaluated the phylogenetic signal in the number of partners alone. Lastly, we calculated clade-specific Mantel tests for sub-networks containing at least 10 species (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib59">Perez-Lamarque et al., 2022b</xref>) to evaluate whether phylogenetic signal was stronger for specific subclades of mammals or coronaviruses. Ten thousand permutations were used in each analysis to assess significance. Analyses were conducted using the phylosignal_network and phylosignal_sub_network functions in the R package RPANDA (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib51">Morlon et al., 2016</xref>).</p></sec><sec id="s4-6"><title>Coronaviridae origination and host switches</title><p>We used the amalgamated likelihood estimation–(ALE – <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib73">Szöllõsi et al., 2013</xref>) to reconcile the mammal and coronaviruses evolutionary history using events of cospeciations, host switches, duplications, and losses. Originally designed in the context of gene tree – species tree reconciliations (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib73">Szöllõsi et al., 2013</xref>), ALE has also been particularly useful in the context of host-symbiont cophylogenetic analyses as it considers both phylogenetic uncertainty of the symbiont evolutionary history and undersampling of host species (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib60">Perez-Lamarque and Morlon, 2022</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Groussin et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Bailly-Bechet et al., 2017</xref>). ALE indeed assumes that host switches may imply an unsampled or extinct intermediate host lineage (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib74">Szöllosi et al., 2013</xref>). ALE therefore intrinsically accounts for the incompleteness of our dataset, <italic>i.e</italic>. the fact that we only observe a subsample of mammalian species for which coronaviruses have been detected among all the infected species.</p><p>We ran ALE with the posterior distribution of phylogenetic trees of coronaviruses generated with PhyloBayes to estimate the maximum likelihood rates of host switches, duplications, and losses of the coronaviruses. We first tried running the ‘dated’ version of ALE, which accounts for the order of branching events in the host phylogeny, therefore only allowing for time-consistent host switches (i.e. host switches that happen between two contemporary host lineages). However, this led to unrealistic parameter estimates (such as very high loss rates) and ALE was not able to output possible reconciliations, suggesting that the mammalian and Coronaviridae trees are too incongruent to be reconciled with only time-consistent host switches, that is the scenario of codiversification is likely unrealistic. We therefore used the ‘undated’ version of ALE that only exploits the topology of both the host and the symbiont tree and thus does not constrain the host switches to be time-consistent. ALE generated a total of 5000 reconciliations, from which we extracted the mean number of cospeciations, host switches, duplications, and losses. We also reported the likely origination of coronaviruses in mammals (i.e. the branch in the mammal phylogeny that was first infected by coronaviruses) by computing, for each branch of the mammalian tree, the frequency of reconciliations (among the 5000) that supported an origination in that branch. If a reconciliation requires more cospeciation events and fewer host switch events, than expected under a null scenario of independent evolution, this indicates that the evolution of the symbiont was not independent of that of the host, and in this case, we talk about a ‘significant reconciliation’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Dorrell et al., 2021</xref>).</p><p>We evaluated the significance of the reconciliation by comparing the estimated number of cospeciation and host switch events to null expectations obtained with ALE by shuffling the mammal host species across the mammal tree, both randomly or within major biogeographic regions according to the proposal of regions by <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Barry Cox, 2001</xref> for mammals (six biogeographic regions: North American, South American, African, Eurasian, Oriental, and Australian). We considered a reconciliation to be significant if the observed number of cospeciations was higher than 95% of the null expectations and if the number of host switches was lower than 95% of the null expectations (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib60">Perez-Lamarque and Morlon, 2022</xref>). The likeliness of a host switch between two mammal lineages is measured as the frequency of the reconciliations in which it occurs. Finally, we reported the ratio of time-inconsistent host switches by focusing on ‘back-in-time’ switches, from a donor mammal lineage to an older receiver mammal lineage that never coexisted. We identified time-inconsistent host switches directly on the consensus mammalian phylogeny, or considering the 95% credible interval around each age node estimate to avoid counting time-inconsistent host switches that may arise from incorrect estimates of divergence times.</p><p>Because ALE estimated a large proportion of time-inconsistent host switches (see Results), we first tested the scenario of a more recent origination by collapsing all mammalian nodes anterior to X Myr into a polytomy at the root of the phylogeny (with X varying from 55 Myr to 5 Myr), such that the coronavirus origination and host switches inferred by ALE could not involve mammal lineages older than X Myr. Second, we investigated the scenario of diversification by pure preferential host switches of the coronaviruses among extant mammals. To do so, we ran ALE on a star mammalian phylogenetic tree. In this context, ALE could no longer infer cospeciations, and only fit events of host switches, duplications, or losses. When inferring a likely host switch between two specific mammalian lineages on a star phylogeny, there are often as many reconciliations suggesting one directionality of the host switch (i.e. from one of the lineages to the other) as the other. We then only kept host switches present in at least 10% of the reconciliations and looked at the ratio between the number of host switches that were estimated within versus between mammal orders. We compared this ratio to a null expectation obtained by randomly shuffling the host mammal species.</p><p>We conducted the same set of analyses on the sub-datasets formed by alpha- and betacoronaviruses separately. The dated version of ALE was able to output reconciliations for the alphacoronaviruses dataset, but not for the betacoronaviruses.</p><p>Recombination is frequent in viruses and the palmprint region may be recombined, such that different fragments of the palmprint region may have different evolutionary histories, potentially biasing our inference. We carried several recombination tests (OpenRDP - <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib48">Martin et al., 2021</xref>), our own custom code, and Gubbins, 78 that were inconclusive, suggesting that the palmprint region is too short to infer anything about recombination. We therefore instead tested whether the results we obtained on the whole 150-amino acid palmprint region could be impacted by recombination by replicating the ALE analyses on two sub-regions: the first part (positions 1–75) and the last part (positions 76–150).</p><p>We also repeated our cophylogenetic analyses using eMPRess (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib70">Santichaivekin et al., 2021</xref>), another event-based cophylogenetic approach that reconciles host-symbiont evolutionary histories using maximum parsimony. eMPRess is a recent improved version of the popular Jane approach <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Conow et al., 2010</xref>; it differs from Jane especially by not relying only on a heuristic and therefore guarantying that the solution truly corresponds to the maximum parsimony reconciliation(s) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib70">Santichaivekin et al., 2021</xref>). However, contrary to Jane, eMPRess does not offer the possibility to constrain host switches to occur only among lineages from pre-specified time periods. eMPRess requires specifying cost values for the events of host switches (t), duplications (d), and losses (l). We tested two sets of cost values: (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Alekseev et al., 2008</xref>) cost values that disadvantage host switches (d=6, t=6, l=1) and (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">De Groot, 2022</xref>) uniform cost values that favor host switches (d=1, t=1, l=1). As with ALE, we evaluated the significance of the reconciliations using permutations. We ran eMPRess analyses on a set of 50 trees randomly sampled from the posterior distribution of PhyloBayes.</p></sec><sec id="s4-7"><title>Sampling biases</title><p>More effort has been put on the characterization of coronaviruses associated with humans, domesticated animals, and bats (bats represent 47% of the mammalian species in our dataset, in part because many bat species have been intensively screened for viruses). This can lead to two main sampling biases that could potentially impact our conclusions: (i) unequal sampling effort across mammalian species that have been screened, and (ii) unequal screening of mammalian species across the mammal tree of life. To assert whether such sampling biases could generate spurious results we designed two subsampling strategies and re-run the PhyloBayes and ALE analyses on each subsampled dataset. First, For the unequal sampling effort across mammalian species, we randomly subsampled only three Genbank accession codes per host species (and removed species described by less than three accessions). We replicated the subsampling 50 times and ran ALE on each subsampled dataset. The resulting dataset contained a total of 46 host species. Second, for the unequal screening of mammalian species across the mammal tree of life, we subsampled the dataset at the level of mammalian orders. Thus, we randomly subsampled up to 10 species per mammalian order. Only four mammalian orders (Chiroptera, Rodentia, Artiodactyla, and Carnivora) had at least 10 species, the other orders were kept unmodified. We replicated the subsampling 50 times and ran ALE on each subsampled dataset. The resulting dataset contained a total of 53 mammalian species.</p></sec><sec id="s4-8"><title>Simulation analyses</title><p>By running the undated version of ALE either on the mammal phylogeny or a star phylogeny, we proposed a framework to evaluate whether the cophylogenetic pattern is due to a history of ancient codiversification (i.e. a mix of cospeciations, host switches, duplications, and losses; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1A</xref>) or to a scenario where the coronaviruses diversify more recently by preferential host switches (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">de Vienne et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1B</xref>). To validate the interpretation of our ALE results, we performed simulations under the two alternative scenarios of codiversification and diversification by preferential host switches.</p><p>For the scenario of codiversification, we assumed that coronaviruses originated in the ancestors of bats and that they subsequently codiversified with the mammals by experiencing events of cospeciations, host switches, duplications, and losses. We used the function <italic>sim_microbiota</italic> in the R-package HOME to obtain the corresponding coronavirus sequences and coronavirus-mammals associations (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib57">Perez-Lamarque and Morlon, 2019</xref>). We sampled a number of host switches uniformly between 100 and 150, used a duplication rate of 0.001, and simulated losses by host switching replacement. Given the simulated coronaviruses phylogenies, we simulated on it the evolution of a 450 bp nucleotide sequence using a K80 model with a substitution rate of 0.5 and an expected proportion of variable sites of 50% (see <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib60">Perez-Lamarque and Morlon, 2022</xref>, for further details on the model).</p><p>For the scenario of coronaviruses diversification by preferential host switches, we used a birth-death model (pbtree function in the R-package phytools) to simulate a phylogenetic tree of the coronaviruses: in our model, each coronavirus lineage is associated with a single host species, a birth event corresponds to a host switch (at rate 50), while a death event corresponds to a loss of a coronavirus in a host lineage (at rate 5). We started the diversification by assuming a single coronavirus infection in <italic>Eidolon helvum</italic> (a bat host of external lineages within betacoroviruses, u25738 and u27845). Then, following <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">de Vienne et al., 2007</xref> and <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib58">Perez-Lamarque et al., 2022a</xref>, we modeled preferential host switches by assuming that for a host switch from a given donor mammal species, each potential receiver species has a probability proportional to exp(–0.035*<italic>d</italic>) where <italic>d</italic> is the phylogenetic distance between the donor and receiver species. Finally, we simulated RNA sequences of the coronavirus sequences using the function <italic>simulate_alignment</italic> in HOME. For each type of simulation, we generated 50 simulated datasets of mammal-coronavirus associations. For each dataset, we ran PhyloBayes and ALE on both the mammalian phylogeny and the star phylogeny.</p><p>In addition, we used simulations to test for a scenario where coronaviruses originated outside of bats but diversify faster within-bats than within other mammalian lineages, as previously suggested given the efficient immune systems of bats (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Banerjee et al., 2020</xref>). We simulated originations in rodents followed by diversification by preferential host switches (as above) with a host switch rate twice more important in bats (rate 80) than in other mammals (rate 40). For each simulated dataset, we ran PhyloBayes and ALE on the star phylogeny and reported the percentage of originations incorrectly inferred in bats. Parameters of the simulations were chosen to mimick the diversity of the original mammal-coronavirus associations.</p></sec><sec id="s4-9"><title>Geographic distribution of coronaviridae</title><p>We downloaded geographic range maps for each mammalian host species, with the exception of <italic>Homo sapiens</italic>, from the Map of Life website (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://mol.org/species/">https://mol.org/species/</ext-link>; see <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib47">Marsh et al., 2022</xref>).

The study focuses on unraveling the evolutionary trajectory of these viruses, which have shown a high propensity for causing pandemics, as evidenced by the SARS-CoV2 outbreak.</p><p>The research addresses a significant gap in our understanding of the evolutionary dynamics of coronaviruses, particularly their history, patterns of host-to-host transmission, and geographical spread. These aspects are important for predicting and managing future pandemic scenarios.</p><p>Historically, studies have employed cophylogenetic tests to explore virus-host relationships within the Coronaviridae family, often suggesting a long history of virus-host codiversification spanning millions of years. However, the team led by Perez-Lamarque proposes a novel phylogenetic framework that contrasts this traditional view. Their approach, which involves adapting gene tree-species tree reconciliation, is designed to robustly test the validity of two competing scenarios: an ancient origination and codiversification versus a more recent emergence and diversification through host switching.</p><p>Upon applying this innovative framework to the study of coronaviruses and their mammalian hosts, the authors' findings challenge the prevailing notion of a deep evolutionary history. Instead, their results strongly support a scenario where coronaviruses have a more recent origin, likely in bat populations, followed by diversification predominantly through host-switching events. This diversification, interestingly, seems to occur preferentially within mammalian orders.</p><p>A critical aspect of their findings is the identification of hotspots of coronavirus diversity, particularly in East Asia and Europe. These regions align with the proposed scenario of a relatively recent origin and subsequent localized host-switching events. The study also highlights the rarity of spillovers from bats to other species, yet underscores the relatively higher likelihood of such spillovers occurring towards humans, suggesting a significant role for humans as an intermediate host in the evolutionary journey of these viruses.</p><p>The research also points out the high rates of host-switching within mammalian orders, including between humans, domesticated animals, and non-flying wild mammals.</p><p>In conclusion, the study by Perez-Lamarque and colleagues presents an important quantitative advance in our understanding of the evolutionary history of mammalian coronaviruses. It suggests that the long-held belief in extensive virus-host codiversification may have been substantially overestimated, paving the way for a reevaluation of how we understand, predict, and potentially control the spread of these viruses.</p><p>Strengths:</p><p>The study is conceptually robust, and its conclusions are convincing.</p><p>Weaknesses:</p><p>The authors could only use the &quot;undated&quot; model in ALE, with the dated method (which only allows time-consistent transfers) failing on their dataset. The authors did attempt to address this issue in the revision, albeit with limited success.</p></body></sub-article><sub-article article-type="author-comment" id="sa3"><front-stub><article-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.91745.3.sa3</article-id><title-group><article-title>Author response</article-title></title-group><contrib-group><contrib contrib-type="author"><name><surname>Maestri</surname><given-names>Renan</given-names></name><role specific-use="author">Author</role><aff><institution>Universidade Federal do Rio Grande do Sul</institution><addr-line><named-content content-type="city">Porto Alegre</named-content></addr-line><country>Brazil</country></aff></contrib><contrib contrib-type="author"><name><surname>Perez-Lamarque</surname><given-names>Benoît</given-names></name><role specific-use="author">Author</role><aff><institution>Institut de Biologie de l'École Normale Supérieure</institution><addr-line><named-content content-type="city">Paris</named-content></addr-line><country>France</country></aff></contrib><contrib contrib-type="author"><name><surname>Zhukova</surname><given-names>Anna</given-names></name><role specific-use="author">Author</role><aff><institution>Institut Pasteur</institution><addr-line><named-content content-type="city">Paris</named-content></addr-line><country>France</country></aff></contrib><contrib contrib-type="author"><name><surname>Morlon</surname><given-names>Hélène</given-names></name><role specific-use="author">Author</role><aff><institution>Institut de Biologie de l'École Normale Supérieure</institution><addr-line><named-content content-type="city">Paris</named-content></addr-line><country>France</country></aff></contrib></contrib-group></front-stub><body><p>The following is the authors’ response to the original reviews.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p><bold>Public Reviews:</bold></p><p><bold>Reviewer #1 (Public Review)</bold>:</p><p>Summary:</p><p>In this study, Maestri et al. use an integrative framework to study the evolutionary history of coronaviruses.

However, this marker is the one that is currently used for routinely delimiting operational taxonomic units in RNA viruses and reconstructing their evolutionary history (Edgar et al. 2022, see also the Serratus project; <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://serratus.io/">https://serratus.io/</ext-link>); therefore, we took the conscious decision early on to rely on this expertise. Unfortunately, this marker cannot provide robust timescale reconstructions for coronavirus evolution (previous estimates of coronavirus origin range from around 10 thousand years ago to 293 million years ago depending on modeling assumptions). Only future genomic work across Coronaviridae that will characterize multiple genetic regions with different evolutionary rates will allow us to precisely elucidate the timescale of the evolutionary history of coronaviruses alongside their hosts. In the meantime, we show here that, while the RdRp palmprint region cannot by itself resolve the precise timescale of coronavirus evolution, it strongly suggests, when used along with cophylogenetic approaches, a recent evolutionary origin in bats.</p><p>We now further discuss these issues and the perspectives offered by future genomic work on lines 462-485.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p><bold>Reviewer #2 (Public Review):</bold></p><p>Summary:</p><p>In their study titled &quot;Recent evolutionary origin and localized diversity hotspots of mammalian coronaviruses,&quot; authors Benoît Perez-Lamarque, Renan Maestri, Anna Zhukova, and Hélène Morlon investigate the complex evolutionary history of coronaviruses, particularly those affecting mammals, including humans. The study focuses on unraveling the evolutionary trajectory of these viruses, which have shown a high propensity for causing pandemics, as evidenced by the SARS-CoV2 outbreak.</p><p>The research addresses a significant gap in our understanding of the evolutionary dynamics of coronaviruses, particularly their history, patterns of host-to-host transmission, and geographical spread. These aspects are important for predicting and managing future pandemic scenarios.</p><p>Historically, studies have employed cophylogenetic tests to explore virus-host relationships within the Coronaviridae family, often suggesting a long history of virus-host codiversification spanning millions of years. However, the team led by Perez-Lamarque proposes a novel phylogenetic framework that contrasts this traditional view. Their approach, which involves adapting gene tree-species tree reconciliation, is designed to robustly test the validity of two competing scenarios: an ancient origination and codiversification versus a more recent emergence and diversification through host switching.</p><p>Upon applying this innovative framework to the study of coronaviruses and their mammalian hosts, the authors' findings challenge the prevailing notion of a deep evolutionary history. Instead, their results strongly support a scenario where coronaviruses have a more recent origin, likely in bat populations, followed by diversification predominantly through hostswitching events. This diversification, interestingly, seems to occur preferentially within mammalian orders.</p><p>A critical aspect of their findings is the identification of hotspots of coronavirus diversity, particularly in East Asia and Europe. These regions align with the proposed scenario of a relatively recent origin and subsequent localized host-switching events. The study also highlights the rarity of spillovers from bats to other species, yet underscores the relatively higher likelihood of such spillovers occurring towards humans, suggesting a significant role for humans as an intermediate host in the evolutionary journey of these viruses.</p><p>The research also points out the high rates of host-switching within mammalian orders, including between humans, domesticated animals, and non-flying wild mammals.</p><p>In conclusion, the study by Perez-Lamarque and colleagues presents an important quantitative advance in our understanding of the evolutionary history of mammalian coronaviruses. It suggests that the long-held belief in extensive virus-host codiversification may have been substantially overestimated, paving the way for a reevaluation of how we understand, predict, and potentially control the spread of these viruses.</p><p>Strengths:</p><p>The study is conceptually robust, and its conclusions are convincing.</p><p>Weaknesses:</p><p>Despite the availability of a dated host tree the authors were only able to use the &quot;undated&quot; model in ALE, with the dated method (which only allows time-consistent transfers) failing on their dataset (possibly due to dataset size?). Further exploration of the question would be potentially valuable.</p></disp-quote><p>Our intuition is that ALE in its “dated” version does not necessarily fail on our dataset due to its size: ALE runs, but it provides unrealistic parameter estimates and is not able to output possible reconciliations, as mentioned in our Material and Methods section. We think this issue is mostly due to the fact that there is no pattern of codiversification: the coronavirus and mammal trees are so distinct that finding a reconciliation scenario between these trees with time-consistent switches is very difficult and ALE fails at estimating an amalgamated likelihood for such an unlikely scenario. We now ran the dated version of ALE independently on the smaller alpha and betacoronaviruses datasets. It still fails on the betacoronaviruses dataset. On the alphacoronaviruses dataset, it does output significant reconciliations, however these reconciliations have a majority of events of transfers and losses, confirming that codiversification is unlikely in this clade.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p><bold>Reviewer #3 (Public Review):</bold></p><p>Summary:</p><p>This work uses tools and concepts from co-phylogenetic analyses to reconstruct the evolutionary and diversification history of coronaviruses in mammals. It concludes that crossspecies transmissions from bats to humans are a relatively common event (compared to bats to other species). Across all mammals, the diversification history of coronaviruses suggests that there is potential for further evolutionary diversification.</p><p>Strengths:</p><p>The article uses an interesting approach based on jointly looking at the extant network of coronaviruses-mammals interactions, and the phylogenetic history of both these organisms. The authors do an impressive job of explaining the challenges of reconstructing evolutionary dynamics for RNA viruses, and this helps readers appraise the relevance of their approach.</p><p>Weaknesses:</p><p>I remain unconvinced by the argument that sampling does not introduce substantial biases in the analyses. As the authors highlight, incomplete knowledge of the extant interactions would lead to a biased reconstruction of the diversification history. In a recent paper (Poisot et al. 2023, Patterns), we look at sampling biases in the virome of mammals and suggest that is a fairly prominent issue, that is furthermore structured by taxonomy, space, and phylogenetic position. Case in point, even for betacoronaviruses, there have been many newly confirmed hosts in recent years. For organisms that have received less intense scrutiny, I think a thorough discussion of potential gaps in data would be required (see for example Cohen et al. 2022, Nat. Comms).</p><p>I was also surprised to see little discussion of the differences between alpha and beta coronaviruses - there is evidence that they may differ in their cross-species transmission (see Caraballo et al. 2022 Micr. Spectr.), which could call into question the relevance of treating all coronaviruses as a single, homogeneous group.</p><p>Some of the discussions in this paper also echo previous work by e.g. Geoghegan et al. (see 2017, PLOS Pathogens), which I was surprised to not see discussed, as it is a much earlier investigation of the relative frequencies of co-divergence and host switches for different viral families, with a deep discussion of how this may structure future evolutionary dynamics.</p></disp-quote><p>We totally agree that sampling biases in the virome of mammals is a prominent issue, which is why we conducted a series of sensitivity analyses to test their effect on our main conclusions. We thoroughly tested the effect of (i) the unequal sampling effort across mammalian species that have been screened and (ii) the unequal screening of mammalian species across the mammalian tree of life by subsampling the data to correct for the unequal sampling effort (see Supporting Information Text). In both cases, we still reported low support for a scenario of codiversification, the origin in bats in East Asia, the preferential host switches within mammalian orders, and the rare spillovers from bats to humans. The robustness of our findings to sampling biases may be explained by the fact that the cophylogenetic approach we used (ALE) explicitly accounts for undersampling by assuming that all host switches involve unsampled intermediate hosts. To address the reviewer's comment, we now better underline the importance of sampling biases in our main text (see Discussion, lines 487-494) with supporting references (note that we did not find the Cohen et al. Nature Comm reference). We also better highlight our sensitivity analyses by moving them from the Supporting Information Text to the main text.</p><p>We agree that distinguishing between alpha and beta coronaviruses provides useful additional insights. We have run separate cophylogenetic analyses for these two sub-clades and now report the results of these additional analyses in the revised manuscript, and put them in context with the existing literature about the two sub-clades.</p><p>We were not aware of the work of Geoghegan et al.

We have now run BEAST2 with the LG model (thanks to the BEAST_CLASSIC package) and we obtained very similar results (see Figure below showing the BEAST consensus trees obtained with the WAG or LG models – they only slightly differ by the branching of the u7351 OTU).

These tests were however inconclusive, indicating either the absence or presence of recombination, thus suggesting that the palmprint region is too short to infer anything about recombination. We thus do not exclude the possibility that recombination occurred, and test the robustness of our results to recombination by running our analyses on different sub-parts of the palmprint region.
