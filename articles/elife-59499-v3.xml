Blood flow is a fundamental determinant of tissue CO<sub>2</sub>/H<sup>+</sup>, yet little is known regarding how regulation of vascular tone in chemoreceptor regions contributes to respiratory behavior. Previously, we showed in rat that CO<sub>2</sub>/H<sup>+</sup>-vasoconstriction in the retrotrapezoid nucleus (RTN) supports chemoreception by a purinergic-dependent mechanism (Hawkins et al., 2017). Here, we show in mice that CO<sub>2</sub>/H<sup>+</sup> dilates arterioles in other chemoreceptor regions, thus demonstrating CO<sub>2</sub>/H<sup>+</sup> vascular reactivity in the RTN is unique. We also identify P2Y<sub>2</sub> receptors in RTN smooth muscle cells as the substrate responsible for this response. Specifically, pharmacological blockade or genetic deletion of P2Y<sub>2</sub> from smooth muscle cells blunted the ventilatory response to CO<sub>2</sub>, and re-expression of P2Y<sub>2</sub> receptors only in RTN smooth muscle cells fully rescued the CO<sub>2</sub>/H<sup>+</sup> chemoreflex. These results identify P2Y<sub>2</sub> receptors in RTN smooth muscle cells as requisite determinants of respiratory chemoreception.</p></abstract><kwd-group

Typically, an increase in neural activity triggers vasodilation to increase delivery of nutrients and clear metabolic waste (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Chow et al., 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Ladecola, 2017</xref>). Blood flow may also directly regulate neural activity and contribute to behavior; perhaps, the most compelling evidence supporting this involves vasoregulation by CO<sub>2</sub>/H<sup>+</sup>. In most cases, CO<sub>2</sub>/H<sup>+</sup> function as potent vasodilators to provide support for metabolic activity and to maintain brain pH within the narrow range that is conducive to life (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Ainslie and Duffin, 2009</xref>). However, CO<sub>2</sub>/H<sup>+</sup> has the opposite effect on vascular tone in a brainstem region known as the retrotrapezoid nucleus (RTN) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Hawkins et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib40">Wenzel et al., 2020</xref>), where CO<sub>2</sub>/H<sup>+</sup> is not just metabolic waste to be removed but also functions as a primary stimulus for breathing (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Guyenet et al., 2019</xref>). Neurons (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Guyenet et al., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Kumar et al., 2015</xref>) and astrocytes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Gourine et al., 2010</xref>) in this region are specialized to regulate breathing in response to changes in tissue CO<sub>2</sub>/H<sup>+</sup> (i.e. function as respiratory chemoreceptors) and so vasoconstriction may augment this function by preventing CO<sub>2</sub>/H<sup>+</sup> washout and maintaining the stimulus to respiratory chemoreceptors. However, it is not known whether CO<sub>2</sub>/H<sup>+</sup> induced vasoconstriction is unique to the RTN or also contributes to chemotransduction in other chemosensitive brain regions. Also, mechanisms underlying this specialized CO<sub>2</sub>/H<sup>+</sup> regulation of vascular tone in the RTN are largely unknown. Previous work showed that RTN chemoreception involves CO<sub>2</sub>/H<sup>+</sup>-evoked ATP-purinergic signaling most likely from astrocytes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Gourine et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">Wenker et al., 2012</xref>); however, downstream cellular and molecular targets of this signal are not known.</p><p>Here, we show that CO<sub>2</sub>/H<sup>+</sup> vascular reactivity in the RTN is unique compared to other chemoreceptor regions. Our evidence also suggests that CO<sub>2</sub>/H<sup>+</sup> constriction in the RTN enhances chemoreceptor activity and respiratory output, while simultaneous dilation in other chemoreceptor regions may serve to limit chemoreceptor activity and stabilize breathing. We also show that endothelial cells and vascular smooth muscle cells in the RTN have a unique purinergic (P2) receptor expression profile compared to other levels of the respiratory circuit that is consistent with P2Y<sub>2</sub>-dependent vasoconstriction. Further, at the functional level, we show pharmacologically and genetically using P2Y<sub>2</sub> conditional knockout (P2Y<sub>2</sub> cKO) mice and RTN smooth muscle-specific P2Y<sub>2</sub> re-expression that P2Y<sub>2</sub> receptors on vascular smooth muscle cells in the RTN are required for CO<sub>2</sub>/H<sup>+</sup>-dependent modulation of breathing.</p></sec><sec id="s2" sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><sec id="s2-1"><title>P2Y<sub>2</sub> receptors are differentially expressed by vascular smooth muscle cells in the RTN</title><p>Purinergic signaling is required for CO<sub>2</sub>/H<sup>+</sup>-induced constriction of RTN arterioles (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Hawkins et al., 2017</xref>). Therefore, as a first step toward identifying the cellular and molecular basis of this response, we determined the repertoire of P2 receptors expressed by endothelial and smooth muscle cells associated with arterioles in the RTN. We also characterize the P2 receptor expression profile of vascular cells in the caudal aspect of the nucleus of the solitary tract (cNTS) and raphe obscurus (ROb), two putative chemoreceptor regions where P2 receptor signaling does not contribute to respiratory output (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">Sobrinho et al., 2014</xref>). For this experiment, we used Cre-dependent smooth muscle (<italic>Myh11</italic><sup>Cre/eGFP</sup>) and endothelial cell (<italic>Tek</italic><sup>Cre</sup>::TdTomato) reporter lines and performed fluorescence activated cell sorting to obtain enriched populations of endothelial or smooth muscle cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1</xref>). Control tissue was obtained at the same level of brainstem but outside the region of interest. Each population of cells was pooled from three to eight adult mice per region for subsequent quantitative RT-PCR for each of the fourteen murine P2 receptor subtypes. The type and relative abundance of P2 receptor transcript expressed by each cell type was similar to the cortex (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">Vanlandewijck et al., 2018</xref>) and relatively consistent between brainstem regions. For example, endothelial cells from each region express ionotropic <italic>P2rx4 </italic>and <italic>P2rx7 </italic>and metabotropic <italic>P2ry1,2,6,12-14</italic> receptor transcript, albeit at varying levels relative to control (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1A</xref>). Also, <italic>P2rx1,4 </italic>and <italic>P2ry2,6,14</italic> receptor transcript were detected in smooth muscle cells from each region and most were under-expressed relative to control (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1B</xref>). The P2 transcript profile of vascular cells in the RTN was fairly similar to the ROb (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1A–B</xref>) but differed from the cNTS in several ways including lower expression of <italic>P2ry6</italic> in endothelial cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1A</xref>) and higher expression of <italic>P2rx1</italic>, <italic>P2rx4</italic>, and <italic>P2ry14</italic> in smooth muscle cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1B</xref>). However, only <italic>P2ry2</italic> in the RTN showed a distinct expression profile that was consistent across cell types with a role in vasoconstriction; <italic>P2ry2</italic> transcript was detected at lower (−9.2 ± 0.3 log<sub>2</sub> fold change, p=0.0013) and higher (6.8 ± 1.5 log<sub>2</sub> fold change, p=0.0462) levels compared to control in RTN endothelial and vascular smooth muscle cells, respectively (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1A–B</xref>). This is interesting because in other brain regions activation of endothelial P2Y<sub>2</sub> receptors favors nitric-oxide-induced vasodilation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Marrelli, 2001</xref>), whereas activation of this same receptor in vascular smooth muscle cells mediates vasoconstriction (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Brayden et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Lewis et al., 2000</xref>). These results identify P2Y<sub>2</sub> receptors in vascular smooth muscle cells as potential substrates for CO<sub>2</sub>/H<sup>+</sup>-induced ATP-dependent vasoconstriction in the RTN.</p><fig-group><fig id="fig1" position="float"><label>Figure 1.</label><caption><title>CO<sub>2</sub>/H<sup>+</sup> differentially regulates arteriole tone in the RTN by a P2Y<sub>2</sub> receptor dependent mechanism.</title><p>(<bold>A-B</bold>) Tissue sections containing the cNTS, ROb, and RTN were prepared from an endothelial cell (<italic>Tek</italic><sup>Cre</sup>::TdTomato) and smooth muscle cell reporter mice (<italic>Myh11</italic><sup>Cre/eGFP</sup>).

To test this, we disrupted CO<sub>2</sub>/H<sup>+</sup> dilation by injecting the vasoconstrictor U46619 (a thromboxane A2 receptor agonist) into the cNTS and ROb while measuring cardiorespiratory activity in anesthetized mice breathing a level of CO<sub>2</sub> required to maintain respiratory activity (2–3% CO<sub>2</sub>). We found that injections of U46619 (1 μM) into the cNTS alone caused an increase in breathing frequency but together with the ROb resulted in unstable breathing as evidenced by frequent bouts of hyperventilation followed by apnea (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3A</xref>) (1.2 ± 0.6, vs. saline: 0.4 ± 0.2 apneas/min; p&lt;0.001) and increased breath to breath variability (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3C–E</xref>).

To determine whether P2Y<sub>2</sub> cKO mice exhibit respiratory problems, we used whole-body plethysmography to measure baseline breathing and the ventilatory response to CO<sub>2</sub> in conscious unrestrained adult mice (mixed sex). Consistent with the possibly that smooth muscle P2Y<sub>2</sub> receptor-mediated vasoconstriction in the RTN augments the ventilatory response to CO<sub>2</sub>, we found that P2Y<sub>2</sub> cKO mice exhibit normal respiratory activity under room air conditions (<xref ref-type="table" rid="table1">Table 1</xref>) but pronounced hypoventilation during exposure to graded increases in CO<sub>2</sub> (balance O<sub>2</sub> to minimize input from peripheral chemoreceptors).

Two weeks after virus injection into the RTN region, we confirmed that ~80% of smooth muscle α2 actin (Acta2)-immunoreactive cells in the RTN are also GFP<sup>+</sup> (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s5">Figure 4—figure supplement 5</xref>). Some background eGFP labeling was observed, but not associated with DAPI labeling (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s5">Figure 4—figure supplement 5</xref>).

We show that CO<sub>2</sub>/H<sup>+</sup> constriction by activation of smooth muscle P2Y<sub>2</sub> receptors is unique to the RTN and is required for the normal ventilatory response to CO<sub>2</sub>, whereas simultaneous CO<sub>2</sub>/H<sup>+</sup> vasodilation in other chemoreceptor regions like the cNTS and ROb may serve to stabilizes breathing. Considering these regions sense changes in CO<sub>2</sub>/H<sup>+</sup> to regulate breathing, and since vasoconstriction and dilation are expected to increase and decrease tissue CO<sub>2</sub>/H<sup>+</sup> levels respectively, we speculate that differential CO<sub>2</sub>/H<sup>+</sup> vascular reactivity across multiple chemoreceptor regions serves to fine tune respiratory drive and stability during exposure to high CO<sub>2</sub>. Understanding this novel mechanism may lead to new treatment options for breathing problems, particularly those associated with cardiovascular disease.</p><sec id="s3-1"><title>Experimental limitations</title><p>There are several limitations of this work that should be recognized. First, our in vitro experiments utilized the slice preparation because it allows for easy visualization of vessels in each region of interest and pharmacological manipulation of candidate mechanisms independent of potential confounding effects of blood pressure on myogenic tone. However, because blood vessels in brain slice have limited myogenic tone these experiments were performed in the presence of U-46619 to pre-constrict vessels ~ 30% (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Blanco et al., 2008</xref>). We also used a large stimulus (15% CO<sub>2</sub>) to characterize CO<sub>2</sub>/H<sup>+</sup> vascular reactivity in vitro. For these reasons, we also confirmed in vivo in the absence of U-46619 that more physiological levels of CO<sub>2 </sub>(9–10%) constricted arterioles in the RTN by a P2Y<sub>2</sub>-dependent mechanism. Second, we and others (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib41">Yalcin and Savci, 2004</xref>) showed that administration of U46619 into the NTS increased blood pressure. Although baroreceptor activation has a fairly mild effect on respiratory activity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">McMullan et al., 2009</xref>), it remains possible that the baroreflex contributed to respiratory instability observed during this experimental manipulation. Furthermore, neurons and astrocytes may express thromboxane A2 receptors (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Gao et al., 1997</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Nakahata et al., 1992</xref>) so it is possible respiratory instability caused by injections of U46619 into the cNTS and ROb may involve direct neural or astrocyte activation. Third, CO<sub>2</sub>/H<sup>+</sup> typically increases minute ventilation by increasing both rate and depth of breathing (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">Souza et al., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">Takakura et al., 2014</xref>), yet ventral surface application of drugs to manipulate P2Y<sub>2</sub> receptors only affected tidal volume (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2E–J</xref>). Therefore, it is possible other nearby respiratory centers were affected in this experiment. However, this issue is mitigated by more targeted genetic approaches showing that deletion of P2Y<sub>2</sub> from smooth muscle cells blunted the rate and depth of respiratory responses to CO<sub>2</sub>, and re-expression of P2Y<sub>2</sub> receptors only in RTN smooth muscle cells fully rescued the CO<sub>2</sub>/H<sup>+</sup> chemoreflex.</p></sec><sec id="s3-2"><title>Mechanisms contributing to vascular control of breathing</title><p>Blood flow in the brain is controlled by several mechanisms including neural activity, which leads to vasodilation and increased blood flow by a process termed neurovascular coupling (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Ladecola, 2017</xref>). Autoregulation is a mechanism that maintains cerebral blood flow in response to changes in perfusion pressure (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">Paulson et al., 1990</xref>). For example, myogenic tone increases with increased perfusion pressure and relaxes with decreased pressure. CO<sub>2</sub>/H<sup>+</sup> also functions as a potent vasodilator in most brain regions (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Hoiland et al., 2019</xref>) and is perhaps the most potent regulator of cerebrovascular tone since high CO<sub>2</sub>/H<sup>+</sup> can impair both autoregulation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Ogoh and Ainslie, 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Perry et al., 2014</xref>) and neurovascular coupling (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Maggio et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Maggio et al., 2014</xref>). Since CO<sub>2</sub>/H<sup>+</sup> is a waste product of metabolism, CO<sub>2</sub>/H<sup>+</sup> vascular reactivity provides a means of matching local blood flow with tissue metabolic needs. However, at the level of the RTN this need appears secondary to chemoreceptor regulation of respiratory activity. For example, we (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Hawkins et al., 2017</xref>) and others (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib40">Wenzel et al., 2020</xref>) showed that exposure to high CO<sub>2</sub>/H<sup>+</sup> constricted RTN arterioles, and disruption of this response blunted the ventilatory response to CO<sub>2</sub>.</p><p>The cellular and transmitter basis for CO<sub>2</sub>/H<sup>+</sup>-induced constriction of RTN arterioles appears to involve CO<sub>2</sub>/H<sup>+</sup>-evoked ATP release from local astrocytes. For example, previous work showed that (i) CO<sub>2</sub>/H<sup>+</sup> caused discrete release of ATP near the RTN region (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Gourine et al., 2005</xref>); (ii) astrocytes in the RTN show Ca<sup>2+</sup> responses to mild acidification (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Gourine et al., 2010</xref>); and (iii) activation of astrocytes with tACPD, an mGluR agonist widely used to elicit Ca<sup>2+</sup> elevations in astrocytes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Howarth et al., 2017</xref>), constricted RTN arterioles by a purinergic-dependent mechanism (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Hawkins et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2B</xref>), whereas application of an ATP receptor blocker to the ventral surface blunted CO<sub>2</sub>/H<sup>+</sup>-induced vasoconstriction and the ventilatory response to CO<sub>2</sub> (18). Here, we extend this work by showing that CO<sub>2</sub>/H<sup>+</sup> vascular responses in the RTN are opposite to other chemoreceptor regions, and we identify P2Y<sub>2</sub> receptors in vascular smooth muscle cells as requisite determinants of RTN CO<sub>2</sub>/H<sup>+</sup> vascular reactivity and chemoreception. For example, P2Y<sub>2</sub> is a metabotropic receptor that couples with Gq, Go and G12 proteins (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Erb and Weisman, 2012</xref>; activation of this receptor in smooth muscle is associated with vasoconstriction; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Brayden et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Lewis et al., 2000</xref>), whereas its activation in endothelial cells favors nitric oxide-mediated vasodilation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Marrelli, 2001</xref>). Consistent with a role in vasoconstriction, we found that P2Y<sub>2</sub> transcript was expressed at higher than control levels in RTN smooth muscle cells and at lower than control levels in RTN endothelial cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1A–B</xref>). Furthermore, pharmacological experiments show in vitro (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1C–E</xref>) and in anesthetized mice (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2A–B</xref>) that CO<sub>2</sub>/H<sup>+</sup>-induced constriction of RTN arterioles was eliminated by blocking P2Y<sub>2</sub> receptors with AR-C118925 and mimicked by a selective P2Y<sub>2</sub> receptor agonist (PSB 1114). We also show in awake mice that genetic deletion of P2Y<sub>2</sub> from smooth muscle cells blunted the ventilatory response to CO<sub>2</sub>, and re-expression of P2Y<sub>2</sub> receptors only in RTN smooth muscle cells fully rescued the CO<sub>2</sub>/H<sup>+</sup> chemoreflex (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4A–F</xref>). These results establish P2Y<sub>2</sub> receptors in RTN smooth muscle cells as requisite determinants of respiratory chemoreception.</p><p>It should be noted that other cell types and signaling pathways may also contribute to RTN vascular reactivity. For example, endothelial cells including those in the RTN, express H<sup>+</sup> activated GPR4 receptors that when activated facilitates release of vasoactive effectors including thromboxane to mediate vasoconstriction (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib40">Wenzel et al., 2020</xref>). Consistent with this, disruption of GPR4 signaling blunted CO<sub>2</sub>/H<sup>+</sup> vascular reactivity in the RTN and the ventilatory response to CO<sub>2</sub> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib40">Wenzel et al., 2020</xref>). Although untested, it is also possible RTN endothelial cells release other vasoactive signals including ATP, and so may contribute to CO<sub>2</sub>/H<sup>+</sup>-evoked purinergic-dependent constriction of arterioles in this region. Prostaglandin E<sub>2</sub> (PGE<sub>2</sub>) is also thought to contribute to CO<sub>2</sub>/H<sup>+</sup> vascular reactivity. For example, in the cortex CO<sub>2</sub>/H<sup>+</sup> facilitates Ca<sup>2+</sup> oscillations in astrocytes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Gourine et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Howarth et al., 2017</xref>) leading to enhanced arachidonic acid metabolism and release of PGE<sub>2</sub>, which triggered arteriole dilation by activation of prostaglandin (EP<sub>1</sub>) receptors (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Howarth et al., 2017</xref>). In the RTN, CO<sub>2</sub>/H<sup>+</sup> also causes PGE<sub>2</sub> release most likely from astrocytes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Forsberg et al., 2017</xref>) and contributes to RTN chemoreception by a mechanism involving EP3 receptors (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Forsberg et al., 2016</xref>). However, selective blockade of EP<sub>3</sub> receptors minimally affected CO<sub>2</sub>/H<sup>+</sup> constriction of RTN arterioles (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s2">Figure 1—figure supplement 2</xref>), suggesting PGE<sub>2</sub>/EP<sub>3</sub> signaling contributes to RTN chemoreception by directly targeting CO<sub>2</sub>/H<sup>+</sup>-sensitive neurons or astrocytes.</p><p>In contrast to the RTN, we also found that CO<sub>2</sub>/H<sup>+</sup> (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1C</xref>) and astrocyte activation by bath application of t-ACPD (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1F</xref>) dilatated arterioles in other chemoreceptor regions including the cNTS and ROb. This suggests that CO<sub>2</sub>/H<sup>+</sup>-dependent regulation of vascular tone and roles of astrocytes in this process are fundamentally different in the RTN compared to other chemoreceptor regions. Considering vasoconstriction and dilation are expected to increase and decrease tissue CO<sub>2</sub>/H<sup>+</sup> levels respectively, we propose that CO<sub>2</sub>/H<sup>+</sup> constriction in the RTN supports the drive to breathe by ensuring tissue acidification is maintained to stimulate chemoreceptors in this region, whereas CO<sub>2</sub>/H<sup>+</sup> dilation in the cNTS and ROb provides a means of buffering tissue H<sup>+</sup> and chemoreceptor activity to maintain respiratory stability. Conversely, if CO<sub>2</sub>/H<sup>+</sup> were to cause vasoconstriction across multiple chemoreceptor regions simultaneously, this may exaggerate the ventilatory response to CO<sub>2</sub> to the point of causing unstable periodic breathing (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Cherniack and Longobardo, 2006</xref>). Indeed, this is thought to be the cause of unstable breathing in patients with global deficits in CO<sub>2</sub>/H<sup>+</sup> vascular reactivity due to congestive heart failure or cerebrovascular disease (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Cherniack et al., 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Cherniack and Longobardo, 2006</xref>). Consistent with this, we show that disruption of CO<sub>2</sub>/H<sup>+</sup> dilatation in the cNTS and ROb by application of the vasoconstrictor U46619 while leaving RTN CO<sub>2</sub>/H<sup>+</sup> constriction unperturbed, increased chemoreceptor drive as evidenced by a decrease in the CO<sub>2</sub>/H<sup>+</sup> apneic threshold and caused unstable periodic breathing during exposure to higher levels of CO<sub>2</sub>/H<sup>+</sup> (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3</xref>). However, further work is needed to understand whether and how differential CO<sub>2</sub>/H<sup>+</sup> vascular reactivity in these chemoreceptor regions contributes to breathing problems in disease states.</p></sec></sec><sec id="s4" sec-type="materials|methods"><title>Materials and methods</title><table-wrap id="keyresource" position="anchor"><label>Key resources table</label><table

All arterioles selected for experimentation had a luminal diameter between 8–50 µm. It should be noted that most, if not all, of the cNTS arterioles were small (average diameter was 9 µm) and ROb vasculature did not vary more than 10 µm from the midline of the slice.

Shortly thereafter, slices were transferred to a glass Petri dish on ice. Using a plastic transfer pipette and a 15-blade scalpel, each region of interest was microdissected out of the slices and manually separated into sterile microcentrifuge tubes.

Once microdissection is completed, the tissue chunks were warmed to 34°C for 10 min before trituration. A single-cell suspension was achieved by trituration using a 25G and 30G needle sequentially, attached to a 3 mL syringe. Samples were triturated for an average of 5 min.

Finally, cells were gated either to TdTomato or GFP fluorescence and sorted by four-way purity into a sterile 96-well plate containing 5 µL of sterile PBS per sample. Between 100 and 500 cells were sorted per sample in any experiment and were processed immediately following FACS.

A total of 26 adult male C57BL6 (25–28 g) were used for in vivo experiments. General anesthesia was induced with 5% isoflurane in 100% O2. A tracheostomy was made, and the isoflurane concentration was reduced to 1.4–1.5% until the end of surgery. The carotid artery was cannulated (polyethylene tubing, 0.6 mm o.d., 0.3 mm i.d., Scientific Commodities) for measurement of arterial pressure (AP). The jugular vein was cannulated for administration of fluids and drugs. Rats were placed supine onto a stereotaxic apparatus (Type 1760; Harvard Apparatus) on a heating pad and core body temperature was maintained at a minimum of 36.5°C via a thermocouple. The trachea was cannulated. Respiratory flow was monitored via a flow head connected to a transducer (GM Instruments) and CO<sub>2</sub> via a capnograph (CWE, Inc,) connected to the tracheal tube. Paired EMG wire electrodes (AM-System) were inserted into the external intercostal muscle to record respiratory-related activity. After the anterior neck muscles were removed, a basio-occipital craniotomy exposed the ventral medullary surface, and the dura was resected. After bilateral vagotomy, the exposed tissue around the neck and the mylohyoid muscle was covered with mineral oil to prevent drying. Baseline parameters were allowed to stabilize for 30 min prior to recording.</p><sec id="s4-4-1"><title>In vivo recordings of physiological variables</title><p>Mean arterial pressure (MAP), external intercostal muscle activity (IntEMG) and end-expiratory CO<sub>2</sub> (etCO<sub>2</sub>) were digitized with a micro1401 (Cambridge Electronic Design), stored on a computer, and processed off-line with version 7 of Spike two software (Cambridge Electronic Design). Integrated intercostal activity (∫Int<sub>EMG</sub>) was collected after rectifying and smoothing (τ = 0.03) the original signal, which was acquired with a 300–3000 Hz bandpass filter. Noise was subtracted from the recordings prior to performing any calculations of evoked changes in EMG. A direct physiological comparison of the absolute level of EMG activity across nerves is not possible because of non-physiological factors (e.g. muscle electrode contact, size of muscle bundle) and the ambiguity in interpreting how a given increase in voltage in one EMG relates to an increase in voltage in another EMG. Thus, muscle activity was defined according to its baseline physiological state, just prior to their activation. The baseline activity was normalized to 100%, and the percent change was used to compare the magnitude of increases or decreases across muscle from those physiological baselines.</p></sec><sec id="s4-4-2"><title>In vivo experimental protocol</title><p>Each in vivo experiment began by testing responses to hypercapnia by adding CO<sub>2</sub> to the breathing air supplied by artificial ventilation. The addition of CO<sub>2</sub> was monitored to reach a maximum end-expiratory CO<sub>2</sub> between 9% and 10%, which corresponds with an estimated arterial pH of 7.2 based on the following equation: pHa = 7.955–0.7215 × log10 (EtCO<sub>2</sub>). This maximum end-expiratory CO<sub>2</sub> was maintained for 5 min and then replaced by 100% O<sub>2</sub>.</p><p>To determine whether local regulation of vascular tone in the region of the RTN contributes to the CO<sub>2</sub>/H<sup>+</sup>-dependent drive to breathe, we made injections of saline, PSB1114 (100 µM), AR-C118925 (1 mM) or U46619 (1 µM) while monitoring IntEMG amplitude and frequency. These drugs were diluted with sterile saline (pH 7.4) and applied using single-barrel glass pipettes (tip diameter of 25 µm) connected to a pressure injector (Picospritzer III, Parker Hannifin Corp, Cleveland, OH). For each injection, we delivered a volume of 30 nL over a period of 5 s. Injections in the VMS region were placed 1.9 mm lateral from the basilar artery, 0.9 mm rostral from the most rostral hypoglossal nerve rootlet, and at the VMS. The second injection was made 1–2 min later at the same level on the contralateral side. For injections located at the cNTS or ROb, we used the following coordinates: (a) cNTS: 0.2–0.3 mm rostral to the <italic>calamus scriptorius</italic>, 0.3 mm lateral to midline, and 0.3 mm below the dorsal surface of the brainstem and ROb: 1.2–1.3 mm caudal to the parietal-occipital suture, in the midline, and 5–5.3 mm below the cerebelar surface.</p><p>A cranial optical window was prepared using standard protocols. For the VMS, the anterior neck muscles were removed, a basio-occipital craniotomy exposed the ventral medullary surface, and the dura was resected. Pial vessels in the VMS were located 1.9 mm lateral from the basilar artery and 0.9 mm rostral to the most rostral portion of the hypoglossal nerve rootlet. The surface of the VMS was cleaned with buffer containing (in mmol/L) the following: 135 NaCl, 5.4 KCl, 1 MgCl<sub>2</sub>, 1.8 CaCl<sub>2</sub>, and 5 HEPES, pH 7.3., and a chamber (home-made 1.1-cm-diameter plastic ring was glued with dental acrylic cement attached to a baseplate). The chamber was sealed with a circular glass coverslip (#1943–00005, Bellco). The baseplate was affixed to the Digital Camera (Sony, DCR-DVD3-5) and a light microscope was used for vessel imaging (x40 magnification).</p></sec></sec><sec id="s4-5"><title>In vivo pial vessel imaging</title><sec id="s4-5-1"><title>Animal preparation</title><p>Mixed sex adult mice (&gt;6 weeks of age) were briefly anesthetized with isoflurane (1–3%) followed with an IP injection of 300–500 mg urethane to ensure a deep anesthetic state. The animal was then fixed to stereotaxic ear bars with the ventral side of the animal facing up. The trachea of the animal was then cannulated with a 18G needle to provide 1.5 mL ventilations at a rate of 150 breaths per minute of 5% CO<sub>2</sub>-21% O<sub>2</sub> (balance N<sub>2</sub>) via artificial ventilator (Kent Scientific). After cannulation, deep neck muscles were resected, and the cranial-pharyngeal canal and dura mater of the animal was removed. A digital camera was placed over the ventral surface and focused on the pial vasculature. Animals that did not have well-perfused pial vessels were not included in experimentation. Animals that were excessively bleeding from the surgical site were sacrificed and not included in any analyses.</p></sec><sec id="s4-5-2"><title>In vivo image analysis</title><p>Three linear ROIs were drawn over the pial vasculature we recognize as supplying blood flow to the RTN, similar to the in vitro methods described above. Bright field imaging was analyzed using a macro in ImageJ. Briefly, the macro measured the drop and rise of the local maxima and minima, correlating to vessel boundaries. These boundaries were then used to make a linear measurement between the two points which was vessel diameter.</p></sec></sec><sec id="s4-6"><title>RTN viral injections</title><p>Adult mice (&gt;20 grams) were anesthetized with 3% isoflurane. The right cheek of the animal was shaved, and an incision was made to expose the right marginal mandibular branch of the facial nerve. The animals were then placed in a stereotaxic frame and a bipolar stimulating electrode was placed directly adjacent to the nerve. Animals were maintained on 1.5% isoflurane for the remainder of the surgery. An incision was made to expose the skull and two 1.5 mm holes were drilled left and right of the posterior fontanelle, caudal of the lambdoidal suture. The facial nerve was stimulated using a bipolar stimulating electrode to evoke antidromic field potentials within the facial motor nucleus. In this way, the facial nucleus on the right side of the animal was mapped in the X, Y, and Z direction using a quartz recording electrode.</p><p>The viral vector was loaded into a 1.2 mm internal diameter borosilicate glass pipette on a Nanoject III system (Drummond Scientific). Virus was injected at least −0.02 mm ventral to the Z coordinates of the facial nucleus, to ensure injection into the RTN. These same coordinates were used for the left side of the animal. In all mice, incisions were closed with nylon sutures and surgical cyanoacrylate adhesive. Mice were placed on a heated pad until consciousness was regained. Meloxicam was administered 24 and 48 hr postoperatively.</p></sec><sec id="s4-7"><title>Telemetry transmitter placement</title><p>Adult mice (&gt;30 grams) were anesthetized with an induction dose of 3% isoflurane and placed into a sterile field. HD-X11 transmitters (Data Sciences International; DSI) were placed and fixed intraperitoneally with non-absorbable nylon sutures, followed by ECG lead placement on the left and right pectoralis on top of the rib cage. Finally, a pressure catheter was placed into the left carotid artery and threaded through to the aortic arch for continuous blood pressure measurements. Animals were closed with nylon sutures and placed on a heated pad u conscious. Mice were continuously watched for the next three days for any post-operative pain complications while meloxicam was administered 24 and 48 hr postoperatively. Mice were not used for any experimentation until post-operative day 7.</p></sec><sec id="s4-8"><title>Unrestrained whole-body plethysmography</title><p>Respiratory activity was measured using a whole-body plethysmograph system (Data Scientific International; DSI), utilizing animal chamber maintained at room temperature and ventilated with air (1.3 L/min) using a small animal bias flow generator. Mice were individually placed into a chamber and allowed 1 hr to acclimate prior to the start of an experiment. Respiratory activity was recorded using Ponemah 5.32 software (DSI) for a period of 15 min in room air followed by exposure to graded increases in CO<sub>2</sub> from 0% to 7% CO<sub>2</sub> (balance O<sub>2</sub>). In separate experiments, we characterized the ventilatory response to 10% O<sub>2</sub> (balance N<sub>2</sub>). Parameters of interests include respiratory frequency (F<sub>R</sub>, breaths per minute), tidal volume (V<sub>T</sub>, measured in mL; normalized to body weight and corrected to account for chamber and animal temperature, humidity, and atmospheric pressure), and minute ventilation (V<sub>E</sub>, mL/min/g). A 20 s period of relative quiescence after 5 min of exposure to each condition was selected for analysis. All experiments were performed between 9 a.m. and 6 p.m. to minimize potential circadian effects.</p></sec><sec id="s4-9"><title>Comprehensive lab animal monitoring (CLAMS)</title><p>Metabolic monitoring (VCO<sub>2</sub>, VO<sub>2</sub>) was performed using comprehensive lab animal monitoring systems (CLAMS, Columbus Instruments). In short, mice were individually housed on a 12:12 light dark cycle in plastic cages with a running wheel, regular bedding, and regular chow for 1 week before experimentation. Three days before the metabolic experiment, each animal was placed in the CLAMS housing cage with metered water and waste collection. Mice had 2 days to acclimate to the metabolic chamber; on the third day, all results were recorded for a continuous 24 hr period. After data collection, all raw results were exported and averaged out per hour. Then, light and dark periods were determined and averaged per animal for statistical analysis. Both sexes were equally represented in the data set.</p></sec><sec id="s4-10"><title>Blood gas analysis</title><p>Arterial blood gasses were collected from adult mice 6 weeks of age and older (&gt;30 grams). A RAPIDLab 348 blood gas analyzer (Siemens) was used for all blood gas analysis; all calibrations, QC, and use were performed as indicated by the manufacturer. Animals were anesthetized with an induction dose of 3% isoflurane and then quickly switched to 1% isoflurane for the remainder of arterial blood collection. This level of isoflurane minimally affects blood gases (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Constantinides et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Loeven et al., 2018</xref>). The left carotid artery was exposed and quickly cannulated to allow for arterial blood to be collected and analyzed by the blood gas analyzer; no more than 5 s was spent between blood collection and analysis on the blood gas analyzer.</p></sec><sec id="s4-11"><title>Immunohistochemistry</title><p>Adult mice were transcardially perfused with 20 mL of room temperature phosphate buffered saline (PBS, pH 7.4) followed by 20 mL of chilled 4% paraformaldehyde (pH 7.4). The brainstem was then removed from the animal and 150 um slices were made using a Zeiss VT100S vibratome. Slices were then incubated in a 0.5% Triton-X/PBS solution for 45 min to permeabilize the tissue. The slices remained in a 0.1% Triton-X/10% Fetal Bovine Serum (FBS, ThermoFisher)/PBS solution for a 12 hr primary antibody incubation of anti-mouse alpha smooth muscle actin (Sigma). The tissue was then washed three times in 0.1% Triton-X/10% FBS/PBS solution; the secondary antibody was incubated with the tissue after the third wash for 2 hr (donkey anti-mouse Alexa Fluor 647, ThermoFisher). The tissue was then washed three times in PBS before mounting on precleaned cover slides with Prolong Diamond with DAPI (ThermoFisher). Imaging of brain slices was achieved with a Leica SP8 confocal microscope.</p></sec><sec id="s4-12"><title>Statistics</title><p>Data are reported as mean ± SE.

consideration by <italic>eLife</italic>. Your article has been reviewed by three peer reviewers, including Jeffrey C Smith as the Reviewing Editor and Reviewer #3, and the evaluation has been overseen by Huda Zoghbi as the Senior Editor. The following individual involved in review of your submission has agreed to reveal their identity: Adrianne G Huxtable (Reviewer #1).</p><p>The reviewers have discussed the reviews with one another and the Reviewing Editor has drafted this decision to help you prepare a revised submission.</p><p>As the editors have judged that your manuscript is of interest, but as described below that additional data are required before it is published, we would like to draw your attention to changes in our revision policy that we have made in response to COVID-19 (https://elifesciences.org/articles/57162). First, because many researchers have temporarily lost access to the labs, we will give authors as much time as they need to submit revised manuscripts. We are also offering, if you choose, to post the manuscript to bioRxiv (if it is not already there) along with this decision letter and a formal designation that the manuscript is &quot;in revision at <italic>eLife</italic>&quot;. Please let us know if you would like to pursue this option. (If your work is more suitable for medRxiv, you will need to post the preprint yourself, as the mechanisms for us to do so are still in development.)</p><p>Summary:</p><p>This paper is an important extension of the authors' previous publication in <italic>eLife</italic> (Hawkins et al., 2017) that presented novel data suggesting that CO<sub>2</sub>/H<sup>+</sup>-mediated vasoconstriction in the brainstem retrotrapezoid nucleus (RTN) supports chemoreception by a purinergic-dependent mechanism. Here the investigators provide new data indicating that CO<sub>2</sub>/H<sup>+</sup> dilates arterioles in other chemoreceptor regions (cNTS, raphe obscurus- ROb), thus suggesting that the CO<sub>2</sub>/H<sup>+</sup> vascular reactivity in the RTN is unique compared to some other brain regions. The investigators significantly advance their previous work by applying a number of new experimental approaches to provide evidence that P2Y<sub>2</sub> receptors in RTN vascular smooth muscle cells are responsible for the purinergic mechanism mediating the vascular reactivity and specifically contribute to RTN chemosensitivity. Importantly, pharmacological blockade or genetic deletion of P2Y<sub>2</sub> from smooth muscle cells blunted the in vivo ventilatory response to CO<sub>2</sub>, and virally-driven re-expression of P2Y<sub>2</sub> receptors in RTN smooth muscle cells rescued the ventilatory response to CO<sub>2</sub>, suggesting that these receptors are required for the normal ventilatory response to CO<sub>2</sub>. New pharmacological evidence is also presented that activation of RTN astrocytes is involved in purinergic signaling driving the RTN vasomotor responses. Overall these results advance the concept that specialized vasoreactivity to CO<sub>2</sub>/H<sup>+</sup> in the RTN contributes to respiratory chemoreception.</p><p>Essential revisions:</p><p>1) Although authors are given leeway in the format of a Research Advance, this paper would benefit from more structure including delineation of Introduction, Results, and Discussion sections. The manuscript would be substantially improved in particular by including a more thorough, dedicated Discussion section with explicit elaboration on limitations of their experimental methods and conclusions, and including discussion of how the important P2Y<sub>2</sub> receptor knockout and re-expression experiments represent a fundamental advance considering that the authors had already implicated (although not completely established) these receptors in their previous publication.</p><p>2) Presentation of the RT-PCR data of purinergic receptor expression profiles can be improved, particularly by providing a more convincing validation of this data such as giving supplementary data of raw numbers for GAPDH levels across areas to prove that GAPDH actually is a valid reference. The authors could also use 3-4 such genes as many investigators do for expression profile calibration. The reviewers note that for the argument it is not necessarily that important how the levels of receptors look in relation to a house keeping gene, but whether P2Y<sub>2</sub> is the only receptor which is relatively highly expressed in RTN smooth muscle cells compared to other regions. Looking at Figure 1B, it seems that relative to the two other areas, P2X1, P2X4 and P2Y14 are also much higher in RTN smooth muscle cells compared to NTS. The reviewers agree that an important aspect is the remarkably low expression of P2Y<sub>2</sub> in endothelium which in theory should oppose constriction by possibly releasing NO.</p><p>3) Additional information on measurements of vascular diameters would be useful. Have the authors obtained measurements from multiple vessels at each time point in the chosen field(s) of view for individual experiments? If so, how do such measurements compare to the representative single vessel measurements for a given experiment presented in the figures? How many vessels per experiment are included in the group summary data? Please explain more completely why it was necessary to induce a 20-30% vasoconstriction by the thromboxane A2 receptor agonist before the measurements.</p><p>4) Some additional validation of the specificity of the AAV2 used for the P2Y<sub>2</sub> re-expression experiments would be helpful since this is not a well characterized virus and may lead to receptor overexpression. Additional nice clear images with proper co-localization would be good to see and additional details about non-smooth muscle cell expression should be provided.</p><p>5) The experiments showing unstable breathing in vivo produced by injecting a thromboxane A2 receptor agonist vasoconstrictor (U46119) into the cNTS and ROb under conditions of mild hypercapnia (2-3% inspired CO<sub>2</sub>) are intriguing, but these experiments lack the proper control of U46119 injections into the cNTS and ROb under normocapnic conditions to determine if this alters blood pressure and produces breathing instabilities independent of any &quot;gain-up&quot; of RTN activity. It would also be of interest to know whether the authors have tested if larger instabilities occur with cNTS/ROb vasoconstriction at higher levels of hypercapnia.</p></body></sub-article><sub-article article-type="reply" id="sa2"><front-stub><article-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.59499.sa2</article-id><title-group><article-title>Author response</article-title></title-group></front-stub><body><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Essential revisions:</p><p>1) Although authors are given leeway in the format of a Research Advance, this paper would benefit from more structure including delineation of Introduction, Results, and Discussion sections.

We also make clear how this work extends our previous findings. Specifically, our previous work showed in vitro that a non-specific blocker of P2Y<sub>2</sub> and P2Y6 blunted RTN CO<sub>2</sub>/H<sup>+</sup> vascular reactivity. We also showed in anesthetized rats that blocking all P2 receptors disrupted CO<sub>2</sub>/H<sup>+</sup> vascular reactivity and the ventilatory response to CO<sub>2</sub>. The current study builds on this work by showing i) CO<sub>2</sub>/H<sup>+</sup> vascular responses in the RTN are opposite to other chemoreceptor regions; ii) vascular endothelial cells and smooth muscle cells in the RTN exhibit a P2 receptor profile that differs from other chemoreceptor regions and favors constriction via P2Y<sub>2</sub>; iii) specific pharmacological manipulations of P2Y<sub>2</sub> mimic and block CO<sub>2</sub>/H<sup>+</sup> vascular reactivity in vitro and in anesthetized mice; and iv) conditional ablation of P2Y<sub>2</sub> from smooth muscle cells blunted the ventilatory response to CO<sub>2</sub> in awake mice, and re-expression of P2Y<sub>2</sub> only in RTN smooth muscle cells rescued the ventilatory response to CO<sub>2</sub>. These results definitively establish P2Y<sub>2</sub> receptors in RTN smooth muscle cells as important determinants of the drive to breathe.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>2) Presentation of the RT-PCR data of purinergic receptor expression profiles can be improved, particularly by providing a more convincing validation of this data such as giving supplementary data of raw numbers for GAPDH levels across areas to prove that GAPDH actually is a valid reference.

The presence/absence of cell type specific genes was used to confirm that we obtained enriched populations of endothelial cells (Figure 1A) or smooth muscle cells (Figures 1B and 4A). Gapdh showed fairly consistent and repeatable Ct values across all regions of interest, and so was used an internal control for results shown in Figures 1A-B and 4A.</p><p>The first section of the Results has been updated to include a comparison of P2 transcript levels between the regions of interest while continuing to highlight the unusual expression profile of <italic>P2ry2</italic> in the RTN.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>3) Additional information on measurements of vascular diameters would be useful.

For an experiment, we monitored vessel diameter over time at three locations along the vessel within the region of interest, and the average of those measurements was used to assess individual vascular responses.</p><p>In any case, we agree that it would be very interesting to understanding how CO<sub>2</sub>/H<sup>+</sup> affects the larger vascular network within and near each chemoreceptor region. This is a direction we plan to pursue in the future.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>How many vessels per experiment are included in the group summary data?</p></disp-quote><p>This information has been added to the text.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Please explain more completely why it was necessary to induce a 20-30% vasoconstriction by the thromboxane A2 receptor agonist before the measurements.</p></disp-quote><p>In intact tissue, blood flow subjects’ vascular smooth muscle to a degree of stretching that results in an autoregulatory increase in myogenic tone. The absence of blood flow in brain slices results in a loss of myogenic tone. In an effort to see vascular responses in either direction (dilation or constriction) we pre-constrict vessels ~30% from maximum dilation using a thromboxane A2 agonist U-46619. This approach is commonly used to study vascular regulation in the brain slice preparation (PMID: <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/18456724">18456724</ext-link>). It is important to note that RTN vascular responses to CO<sub>2</sub>/H<sup>+</sup> and P2Y<sub>2</sub> agonist/antagonist observed in vitro were also confirmed in vivo in the absence of U-46691. We have included this point in the limitations section of the Discussion.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>4) Some additional validation of the specificity of the AAV2 used for the P2Y<sub>2</sub> re-expression experiments would be helpful since this is not a well characterized virus and may lead to receptor overexpression.</p></disp-quote><p>Good suggestion. We characterized P2Y<sub>2</sub> transcript in RTN, brainstem and cortical smooth muscle cells isolated from control mice (<italic>Tagln</italic><sup>Cre</sup>::TdTomato), P2Y<sub>2</sub> cKO mice (<italic>Tagln</italic><sup>Cre</sup>::<italic>P2ry2</italic><sup>f/f</sup>::TdTomato), and P2Y<sub>2</sub> rescue mice (P2Y<sub>2</sub> cKO animals that received bilateral RTN injections of AAV2-<italic>Myh11</italic>p-eGFP-2A-m<italic>P2ry2</italic>). P2Y<sub>2</sub> transcript was not detected in smooth muscle cells from P2Y<sub>2</sub> cKO mice. P2Y<sub>2</sub> was also not detected in cortical smooth muscle cells from either genotype. Conversely, RTN and brainstem but not cortical smooth muscle cells from P2Y<sub>2</sub> rescue mice show P2Y<sub>2</sub> transcript levels in similar to control. These results have been added to Figure 4A.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Additional nice clear images with proper co-localization would be good to see and additional details about non-smooth muscle cell expression should be provided.</p></disp-quote><p>We have added a new supplementary figure (Figure 4—figure supplement 4) that provides several examples of viral transduced smooth muscle cells (eGFP+ and Acta2+). This figure also shows an example of small eGFP puncta in an Acta2-negative cell (Figure 4—figure supplement 4Aii) and examples of eGFP puncta not co-localized with DAPI. Because off-target eGFP labeling was relatively weak we did not attempt to identify non-smooth muscle cell types infected by this virus. Quantification of these results are shown in Figure 4B.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>5) The experiments showing unstable breathing in vivo produced by injecting a thromboxane A2 receptor agonist vasoconstrictor (U46119) into the cNTS and ROb under conditions of mild hypercapnia (2-3% inspired CO<sub>2</sub>) are intriguing, but these experiments lack the proper control of U46119 injections into the cNTS and ROb under normocapnic conditions to determine if this alters blood pressure and produces breathing instabilities independent of any &quot;gain-up&quot; of RTN activity. It would also be of interest to know whether the authors have tested if larger instabilities occur with cNTS/ROb vasoconstriction at higher levels of hypercapnia.</p></disp-quote><p>It is important to note that this work was performed using isoflurane-anesthetized mice which require 2-3% CO<sub>2</sub> in order to maintain respiratory activity (this level of CO<sub>2</sub> is defined as the apneic threshold). Therefore, for this experiment we consider 2-3% CO<sub>2</sub> optimum for detecting changes in respiratory activity in either direction. However, as suggested by the reviewer we did revisit these data to determine if injections of U46619 into the cNTS and ROb affected the CO<sub>2</sub> apneic threshold. Consistent with the possibility that vasoconstriction increases tissue CO<sub>2</sub>/H<sup>+</sup> levels and chemoreceptor drive, we found that in injections of U46619 into the cNTS and ROb lowered the CO<sub>2</sub>/H<sup>+</sup> apneic threshold. These new results have been added as a new Figure 3F.</p><p>We have not tested whether this experimental manipulation results in larger instabilities at higher levels of CO<sub>2</sub>. This is something we plan to explore in the future in control and P2Y<sub>2</sub> cKO mice.</p></body></sub-article></article>
