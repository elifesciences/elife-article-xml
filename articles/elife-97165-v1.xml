MicroRNA-26b (<italic>Mir26b</italic>) might play a role in several MASH-related pathways. Therefore, we aimed to determine the role of <italic>Mir26b</italic> in MASH and its therapeutic potential using <italic>Mir26b</italic> mimic-loaded lipid nanoparticles (LNPs). <italic>Apoe<sup>-/-</sup>Mir26b<sup>-/-</sup></italic>, <italic>Apoe<sup>-/-</sup>Lyz2<sup>cre</sup>Mir26b<sup>fl/fl</sup></italic> mice, and respective controls were fed a Western-type diet to induce MASH. Plasma and liver samples were characterized regarding lipid metabolism, hepatic inflammation, and fibrosis. Additionally, <italic>Mir26b</italic> mimic-loaded LNPs were injected in <italic>Apoe<sup>-/-</sup>Mir26b<sup>-/-</sup></italic> mice to rescue the phenotype and key results were validated in human precision-cut liver slices. Finally, kinase profiling was used to elucidate underlying mechanisms. <italic>Apoe<sup>-/-</sup>Mir26b<sup>-/-</sup></italic> mice showed increased hepatic lipid levels, coinciding with increased expression of scavenger receptor a and platelet glycoprotein 4. Similar effects were found in mice lacking myeloid-specific <italic>Mir26b</italic>. Additionally, hepatic TNF and IL-6 levels and amount of infiltrated macrophages were increased in <italic>Apoe<sup>-/-</sup>Mir26b<sup>-/-</sup></italic> mice. Moreover, <italic>Tgfb</italic> expression was increased by the <italic>Mir26b</italic> deficiency, leading to more hepatic fibrosis. A murine treatment model with <italic>Mir26b</italic> mimic-loaded LNPs reduced hepatic lipids, rescuing the observed phenotype. Kinase profiling identified increased inflammatory signaling upon <italic>Mir26b</italic> deficiency, which was rescued by LNP treatment. Finally, <italic>Mir26b</italic> mimic-loaded LNPs also reduced inflammation in human precision-cut liver slices. Overall, our study demonstrates that the detrimental effects of <italic>Mir26b</italic> deficiency in MASH can be rescued by LNP treatment. This novel discovery leads to more insight into MASH development, opening doors to potential new treatment options using LNP technology.</p></abstract><abstract abstract-type="plain-language-summary"><title>eLife digest</title><p>Fatty liver disease is a condition characterized by the abnormal accumulation of fat in the liver. In certain cases, the fatty build-up can lead to inflammation and, in time, scarring. This advanced stage is known as MASH (short for metabolic dysfunction-associated steatohepatitis), and it can increase the risk of liver failure, cancer, and other complications. Yet the underlying mechanisms that initiate inflammation and thereby drive the disease are still poorly understood. Identifying the molecular factors contributing to this transition could aid in discovering new treatment targets.</p><p>To explore this question, Peters et al. focus on microRNA-26b, a small molecule involved in many heart and metabolic diseases that helps regulate gene expression. They aimed to clarify the role of microRNA-26b in MASH using mice genetically manipulated to lack this regulatory molecule. The experiments revealed that the animals had larger amounts of fat in their livers, with the organs also showing clear signs of scarring and increased inflammation – including high levels of inflammatory signalling molecules and the presence of immune cells known as macrophages.</p><p>Peters et al. then treated the animals with specially designed compounds that can act as microRNA-26b. The molecules were safely delivered to the liver within tiny fat-based spheres known as lipid nanoparticles. Following such treatment, the mice showed decreased levels of liver fat and inflammation. The anti-inflammatory effect of the microRNA-26b ‘mimics’ was also confirmed in human liver samples.</p><p>Together, these results show that microRNA-26b plays a protective role in the development of MASH. Future research should focus on confirming whether these molecules could represent a viable therapeutic treatment, in particular when delivered within lipid-based nanoparticles.</p></abstract><kwd-group kwd-group-type="author-keywords"><kwd>metabolic dysfunction-associated steatohepatitis</kwd><kwd>hepatic inflammation</kwd><kwd>microRNAs</kwd><kwd>lipid

sec-type="intro"><title>Introduction</title><p>‘Metabolic dysfunction-associated steatotic liver disease’ (MASLD), formerly known as non-alcohol fatty liver disease (NAFLD; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Eslam et al., 2020</xref>), is the most common form of fatty liver disease. It accounts for roughly 25% of liver disease cases globally and is defined by fat accumulation in the liver in the absence of heavy alcohol consumption (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Eslam et al., 2020</xref>). MASLD refers to a group of disorders that include simple metabolic dysfunction-associated steatotic liver (MASL) and metabolic dysfunction-associated steatohepatitis (MASH; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Eslam et al., 2020</xref>). An estimated 20–25% of MASL patients will acquire MASH, and both MASL and MASH prevalence are predicted to rise even higher over the next decade due to increased frequency of risk factors such as obesity and insulin resistance (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Peng et al., 2020</xref>). While MASL is still considered reversible and generally benign, its progression into MASH is thought to be harmful in most cases since it precedes the development of liver fibrosis, cirrhosis, and cancer (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Peng et al., 2020</xref>). Moreover, the underlying mechanisms that initiate inflammation and cause MASL to progress into MASH are still poorly understood, restricting the range of available treatments.</p><p>One of the main players that may be involved in these processes is microRNAs. MicroRNAs are short non-coding RNAs that regulate gene expression post-transcriptionally by limiting mRNA translation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Gjorgjieva et al., 2019</xref>). Because microRNAs control numerous genes and processes, multiple microRNAs have been demonstrated to play a role in fundamental aspects of MASH, including lipid metabolism, hepatic inflammation, and fibrosis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Gjorgjieva et al., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">López-Sánchez et al., 2021</xref>).</p><p>Although many microRNAs have been examined in MASLD, the possible pathogenic involvement of numerous others, remains unknown. One of the microRNAs that has been researched in a number of pathologies, including cancer, cardiovascular illnesses, and neurological disorders, is <italic>Mir26b</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">van der Vorst et al., 2021</xref>). However, very little is known about the function of <italic>Mir26b</italic> in the liver and MASH. Nonetheless, some studies have already revealed that <italic>Mir26b</italic> may play a role in several MASH-related pathways. For example, <italic>Mir26b</italic> appears to suppress the nuclear factor-kappa B (NF-κB) pathway in human hepatocellular carcinoma cell lines by inhibiting the expression of TGF-activated kinase-1 (TAK1) and TAK1-binding protein-3, both of which are positive regulators of the NF-κB system (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Zhao et al., 2014</xref>). Furthermore, <italic>Mir26b</italic> has been shown to downregulate the gene expression of platelet-derived growth factor receptor-beta (PDGFR-β), hence reducing hepatic fibrogenesis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Yang et al., 2019</xref>).</p><p>The findings above show that <italic>Mir26b</italic> may play a role in the pathogenesis of MASH, although no study has determined its exact causal involvement in MASH development. In this investigation, we used previously described <italic>Mir26b</italic> knockout mice (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">van der Vorst et al., 2021</xref>) and myeloid cell-specific <italic>Mir26b</italic> knockout mice to clarify the role of <italic>Mir26b</italic> in hepatic lipid metabolism, inflammation, and fibrogenesis. Furthermore, lipid nanoparticles (LNPs), which act as clinically and therapeutically relevant vehicles (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Jeong et al., 2023</xref>), loaded with <italic>Mir26b</italic> mimics were used to restore <italic>Mir26b</italic> levels in mice as well as in human precision-cut liver slices to investigate its therapeutic potential.</p></sec><sec id="s2" sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><sec id="s2-1"><title>Mice deficient in <italic>Mir26b</italic> show increased hepatic lipid levels and an increased expression of hepatic lipid uptake receptors</title><p>To determine the role of <italic>Mir26b</italic> in hepatic lipid metabolism and MASH development, hepatic cholesterol and triglyceride levels were measured in <italic>Apoe<sup>-/-</sup></italic> and <italic>Apoe<sup>-/-</sup>Mir26b<sup>-/-</sup></italic> mice that were fed a 4-week WTD (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1A</xref>).

To identify whether the increase of Mac-1-positive cells is due to macrophage or neutrophil infiltration we also determined the number of Ly6G-positive cells, which remained unchanged, suggesting that the increased number of Mac-1-positive cells was likely the result of an increase in the number of infiltrating macrophages rather than neutrophils (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3F</xref>). Furthermore, the whole-body knockout of <italic>Mir26b</italic> only affected the number of infiltrating macrophages and not Kupffer cells, which are recognized as CD68-positive cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3G</xref>). Furthermore, the number of CD3-positive cells did not differ between <italic>Apoe<sup>-/-</sup>Mir26b<sup>-/-</sup></italic> mice and controls (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3H</xref>), suggesting that <italic>Mir26b</italic> does not affect T-cell counts in the liver.</p><p>Collectively, these results indicate that <italic>Mir26b</italic> plays a protective role in hepatic inflammation by influencing TNF and IL-6 levels and macrophage infiltration in the liver.</p></sec><sec id="s2-3"><title>A knockout of <italic>Mir26b</italic> in mice results in increased hepatic fibrosis, which coincides with an increased expression of <italic>Tgfb</italic></title><p>Continued hepatic inflammation can cause fibrotic changes in the liver, which is another characteristic of MASH (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Peng et al., 2020</xref>). As such, we also investigated the influence of <italic>Mir26b</italic> on hepatic fibrosis in mice. Collagen deposition in liver sections was determined by a Sirius-red staining, which showed that a knockout of <italic>Mir26b</italic> significantly exacerbated hepatic fibrosis (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4A–B</xref>).

This was also further corroborated by pathway analysis (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5D–E</xref>), showing enrichment in pathways related to inflammation (e.g. MAP kinase activation, TLR signaling) and angiogenesis (e.g. VEGF signaling).

While the role of <italic>Mir26b</italic> has already been investigated in various cardio-metabolic diseases (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">van der Vorst et al., 2021</xref>), its role in MASH remained unknown so far. Therefore, this study focused on the role of <italic>Mir26b</italic> in MASH showing that mice deficient in <italic>Mir26b</italic> presented with a higher hepatic lipid content, higher levels of pro-inflammatory cytokines, and an increased number of infiltrated macrophages in the liver and exacerbated hepatic fibrosis. This coincided with an increased activity of kinases that are involved in inflammatory pathways. Finally, when attempting to rescue this phenotype by injecting LNPs loaded with <italic>Mir26b</italic> mimics, we managed to decrease hepatic cholesterol, overall hepatic lipid levels, gene expression of <italic>Msr1</italic>, and the activity of inflammatory kinases. These anti-inflammatory effects of <italic>Mir26b</italic> loaded LNPs were also confirmed in human precision-cut liver slices. Taken together, these results suggest that <italic>Mir26b</italic> plays a protective role in MASH development and shows the therapeutic potential of <italic>Mir26b</italic> loaded LNPs.</p><p>In this study, <italic>Apoe<sup>-/-</sup>Mir26b<sup>-/-</sup></italic> mice showed elevated hepatic cholesterol and triglyceride levels, which coincided with increased expression of <italic>Msr1</italic> and <italic>Cd36</italic>. Generally, MSR1 and CD36 play a critical role in lipid metabolism, as 75–90% of oxidized low-density lipoprotein (ox-LDL) is taken up by macrophages via these receptors (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Kunjathoor et al., 2002</xref>). In line with our observations, previous studies already highlighted that CD36 and MSR1 play a key role in MASH development. For example, a hematopoietic deficiency of these receptors resulted in reduced hepatic inflammation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Bieghs et al., 2010</xref>). Furthermore, a recent study demonstrated that mice lacking MSR1 show decreased hepatic lipid levels and inflammation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Govaere et al., 2022</xref>). Interestingly, they also demonstrated that MSR1 induced JNK signaling (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Govaere et al., 2022</xref>), which is also in line with our kinase activity results. Moreover, it could be demonstrated that <italic>CD36</italic> expression is upregulated in the livers of MASLD patients, leading to hepatic triglyceride accumulation and consequently an exacerbation of hepatic steatosis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Pei et al., 2020</xref>). Overall, this strongly indicates that an increased hepatic expression of <italic>Cd36</italic> and <italic>Msr1</italic> in both mice and humans causes hepatic cholesterol and triglyceride accumulation as well as inflammation, adding fuel to the notion of CD36 and MSR1 as a possible underlying mechanism through which <italic>Mir26b</italic> exerts its effects on MASH development.</p><p>Elevated hepatic lipid levels lead to the release of pro-inflammatory cytokines, consequently mediating liver injury and inflammation in MASH (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Bocsan et al., 2017</xref>), which could also be observed in our study. The elevated levels of pro-inflammatory cytokines in the liver led to the increased number of Mac-1-positive cells, representing infiltrated macrophages. The production of IL-6 and TNF by macrophages in turn led to further local inflammation, also highlighted by the increased inflammatory kinase activity in the liver, thereby causing a vicious cycle of cytokine release and myeloid cell infiltration (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Arrese et al., 2016</xref>). Interestingly, TNF has been shown to promote steatosis by altering lipid metabolism and inducing fatty acid uptake in the liver (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Endo et al., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Kim et al., 2007</xref>), further showing the critical link between inflammation and hyperlipidemia. Additionally, infiltrated macrophages usually form clusters, especially in areas of macrovesicular steatosis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Daemen et al., 2021</xref>), which was in line with our current study. Overall, these findings indicate a crosstalk between hepatic lipid levels, inflammation, and macrophage infiltration and show that <italic>Mir26b</italic> might play a protective role in these processes.</p><p>The third characteristic of MASH that was investigated during this study was hepatic fibrogenesis. Hepatic fibrosis is mainly caused by the activation of the fibrogenic factor TGF-β (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Katsarou et al., 2020</xref>), which is also confirmed in the current study as <italic>Mir26b</italic> knockout mice displayed a higher amount of Sirius red positive area and an increased expression of <italic>Tgfb</italic>. Additionally, <italic>Mmp13</italic>, a protein responsible for extracellular matrix degradation, was upregulated in <italic>Apoe<sup>-/-</sup>Mir26b<sup>-/-</sup></italic> mice, which is probably a secondary compensatory response to the increase in fibrosis. Besides this, MMP13 has been shown to play a less straightforward role in liver fibrosis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Uchinami et al., 2006</xref>). Uchinami et al. demonstrated that levels of TNF and TGF-β were suppressed in MMP13-deficient mice in an early phase of liver fibrosis, suggesting that MMP13 possibly accelerates hepatic fibrogenesis by mediating inflammation. Overall, this indicates that <italic>Mir26b</italic> plays a protective role in hepatic fibrogenesis, possibly due to modulating TGF-β and MMP13 levels.</p><p>Finally, to study the therapeutic potential of <italic>Mir26b</italic>, we injected whole-body knockout mice with <italic>Mir26b</italic> mimic-loaded LNPs. LNP-based therapies have emerged over the last few years and have been extensively studied and even already used in clinical settings (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Peters et al., 2021</xref>), underlining the translatability and potential of our study. Interestingly, the LNP treatment not only showed significant results on hepatic lipid metabolism but also reversed the effects on inflammatory kinase activity, particularly of pathways mediated by key regulators like JNKs, MAPKs, and ERKs. However, the LNP treatment did not seem to affect the inflammatory cytokine, cellular leukocyte influx or fibrosis in the liver, suggesting that the treatment might be to short to see such functional effects on later disease stages. Nonetheless, a note of caution is the fact that we injected the LNPs simultaneously with the diet, providing a more preventative approach as opposed to a curative therapy. Furthermore, we demonstrated that <italic>Mir26b</italic> loaded LNPs have anti-inflammatory effects on human precision-cut liver slices, which, combined with the suppressed levels of cholesterol and hepatic lipids in our mouse model, underline its potential as an exciting therapeutic option.</p><p>Besides the in vivo studies, we also examined the expression levels of <italic>Mir26b</italic> in the plasma of liver cirrhosis patients. Compared to healthy subjects, both <italic>Mir26b</italic>-3p and -5p were expressed higher in patients with liver cirrhosis. This is in contrast to our mouse model in which higher expression levels led to a more beneficial phenotype. Important to note is that the levels of <italic>Mir26b</italic> in the plasma of these patients do not prove causality. The increase in <italic>Mir26b</italic> expression could be due to a mechanism in which the body attempts to rescue the diseased phenotype. This would make the MicroRNA an interesting target as a biomarker though. However, more research should be conducted as the size of the human study is rather limited and only focuses on one of the last stages of MASLD.</p><p>Collectively, these results show that <italic>Mir26b</italic> plays a protective role in the development of MASH by exerting effects on hepatic lipid metabolism, inflammation, and fibrosis. Future research should focus on the further clinical translation of our results by evaluating the effects of <italic>Mir26b</italic> loaded LNPs on various human tissues. Overall, we show here thought-provoking results on the role of <italic>Mir26b</italic> in MASH development and highlight this MicroRNA as a promising therapeutic target, providing a solid base for exciting future research.</p></sec><sec id="s4" sec-type="materials|methods"><title>Materials and methods</title><table-wrap id="keyresource" position="anchor"><label>Key resources table</label><table frame="hsides" rules="groups"><thead><tr><th align="left" valign="bottom">Reagent type (species) or resource</th><th align="left" valign="bottom">Designation</th><th align="left" valign="bottom">Source or reference</th><th align="left" valign="bottom">Identifiers</th><th align="left" valign="bottom">Additional information</th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td align="left" valign="bottom">Strain, strain background (<italic>Mus musculus</italic>)</td><td align="left" valign="bottom"><italic>Apoe<sup>-/-</sup>Mir26b<sup>-/-</sup></italic></td><td align="left" valign="bottom"><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">van der Vorst et al., 2021</xref></td><td align="left" valign="bottom">-</td><td align="left" valign="bottom">-</td></tr><tr><td align="left" valign="bottom">Strain, strain background (<italic>M. musculus</italic>)</td><td align="left" valign="bottom"><italic>Apoe<sup>-/-</sup></italic></td><td align="left" valign="bottom">Jackson</td><td align="left" valign="bottom">Strain #:002052</td><td align="left" valign="bottom">-</td></tr><tr><td align="left" valign="bottom">Strain, strain background (<italic>M. musculus</italic>)</td><td align="left" valign="bottom"><italic>Apoe<sup>-/-</sup>Mir26b<sup>fl/fl</sup></italic></td><td align="left" valign="bottom">Generated in house</td><td align="left" valign="bottom">-</td><td align="left" valign="bottom">-</td></tr><tr><td align="left" valign="bottom">Strain, strain background (<italic>M. musculus</italic>)</td><td align="left" valign="bottom"><italic>Apoe<sup>-/-</sup>Mir26b<sup>fl/fl</sup></italic><break/><italic>Lyz2<sup>Cre+</sup></italic></td><td align="left" valign="bottom">Generated in house</td><td align="left" valign="bottom">-</td><td align="left" valign="bottom">-</td></tr><tr><td align="left" valign="bottom">Other</td><td align="left" valign="bottom">Western-type diet</td><td align="left" valign="bottom">Sniff</td><td align="left" valign="bottom">TD88137</td><td align="left" valign="bottom">Mouse diet</td></tr></tbody></table></table-wrap><sec id="s4-1"><title>Animals</title><p><italic>Apoe<sup>-/-</sup>Mir26b<sup>-/-</sup></italic> mice were generated as described in <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">van der Vorst et al., 2021</xref>. <italic>Apoe<sup>-/-</sup></italic> mice were used as control and all mice were on C57BL/6 J background for more than 10 generations.

In addition, the authors provide a rescue of the miR-26b using lipid nanoparticles (LNPs), with potential therapeutic implications. In addition, the authors provide useful insights on the role of macrophages and some validation of the effect of miR-26b LNPs on human liver samples.</p><p>Strengths:</p><p>The authors provide a well designed mouse model, that aims to characterize the role of miR-26b in a mouse model of metabolic dysfunction-associated steatohepatitis (MASH) generated by Western-type diet on background of Apoe knock-out. The rescue of the phenotypes associated with the model used using miR-26b using lipid nanoparticles (LNPs) provides an interesting avenue to novel potential therapeutic avenues.</p><p>Weaknesses:</p><p>Although the authors provide a new and interesting avenue to understand the role of miR-26b in MASH, the study needs some additional validations and mechanistic insights in order to strengthen the authors' conclusions.</p><p>(1) Analysis the expression of miRNAs based on miRNA-seq of human samples (see <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://ccb-compute.cs.uni-saarland.de/isomirdb/mirnas">https://ccb-compute.cs.uni-saarland.de/isomirdb/mirnas</ext-link>) suggests that miR-26b-5p is highly abundant both on liver and blood. It seems hard to reconcile that despite miRNA abundance being similar on both tissues, the physiological effects claimed by the authors in Figure 2 come exclusively from the myeloid (macrophages).</p><p>- Thanks for the clarification provided on your revised version of the manuscript</p><p>(2) Similarly, the miRNA-seq expression from isomirdb suggests also that expression of miR-26a-5p is indeed 4-fold higher than miR-26b-5p both in liver and blood. Since both miRNAs share the same seed sequence, and most of the supplemental regions (only 2 nt difference), their endogenous targets must be highly overlapped. It would be interesting to know whether deletion of miR-26b is somehow compensated by increased expression of miR-26a-5p loci. That would suggest that the model is rather a depletion of miR-26.</p><p>UUCAAGUAAUUCAGGAUAGGU mmu-miR-26b-5p mature miRNA</p><p>UUCAAGUAAUCCAGGAUAGGCU mmu-miR-26a-5p mature miRNA</p><p>- Thanks for the clarification provided. Nevertheless, I would note that measurements of the host transcript can be difficult to interpret. The processing of the hairpin by Drosha results in rapid decay of the reaming of the non-hairpin part, usually yielding very low expression levels. The mature levels of miR-26a-5p could be more accurate.</p><p>(3) Similarly, the miRNA-seq expression from isomirdb suggests also that expression of miR-26b-5p is indeed 50-fold higher than miR-26b-3p in liver and blood. This difference in abundance of the two strands are usually regarded as one of them being the guide strand (in this case the 5p) and the other being the passenger (in this case the 3p). In some cases, passenger strands can be a byproduct of miRNA biogenesis, thus the rescue experiments using LNPs with both strands on equimolar amounts would not reflect the physiological abundance miR-26b-3p. The non-physiological over abundance of miR-26b-3p would constitute a source of undesired off-targets.</p><p>- I agree with the authors that the functional data doesn't show evidence of undesired off-targets. Nevertheless, I would consider that for future studies. miRNA-phenotypes can be subtle in normal conditions and become more obvious on stressed conditions, the same might apply to off-target effects.</p><p>(4) It would also be valuable to check the miRNA levels on the liver upon LNP treatment, or at least the signatures of miR-26b-3p and miR-26b-5p activity using RNA-seq on the RNA samples already collected.</p><p>- Thanks for providing the miRNA quantification on the revised version of the manuscript.</p><p>(5) Some of the phenotypes described, such as the increase in cholesterol, overlap with the previous publication van der Vorst et al. BMC Genom Data (2021), despite in this case the authors are doing their model in Apoe knock-out and Western-type diet. I would encourage the authors to investigate more or discuss why the initial phenotypes don't become more obvious despite the stressors added in the current manuscript.</p><p>- Thanks for the clarification provided on your revised version of the manuscript.</p><p>(6) The authors have focused part of their analysis on a few gene markers that show relatively modest changes. Deeper characterization using RNA-seq might reveal other genes that are more profoundly impacted by miR-26 depletion. It would strengthen the conclusions proposed if the authors validated that changes on mRNA abundance (Sra, Cd36) do impact the protein abundance. These relatively small changes or trends in mRNA expression, might not translate into changes in protein abundance.</p><p>- Thanks for addressing this concern raised by R1 and R2.</p><p>(7) In figures 5 and 7, the authors run a phosphorylation array (STK) to analyze the changes in the activity of the kinome. It seems that a relatively big number of signaling pathways are being altered, I think that should be strengthened by further validations by Western blot on the collected tissue samples. For quite a few of the kinases there might be antibodies that recognise phosphorylation. The two figures lack a mechanistic connection to the rest of the manuscript.</p><p>- I appreciate the clarification provided by the authors regarding the difference between the activity assay and a Western blot for phosphorylated proteins. Is there any orthogonal technique to validate the PamGene activity assay available?</p><p>Comments on revised version:</p><p>The authors have addressed most of the changes suggested by R1 and R2.</p></body></sub-article><sub-article article-type="author-comment" id="sa3"><front-stub><article-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.97165.3.sa3</article-id><title-group><article-title>Author

reviews.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p><bold>Public Reviews:</bold></p><p><bold>Reviewer #1 (Public Review):</bold></p><p>Based on previous publications suggesting a potential role for miR-26b in the pathogenesis of metabolic dysfunction-associated steatohepatitis (MASH), the researchers aim to clarify its function in hepatic health and explore the therapeutical potential of lipid nanoparticles (LNPs) to treat this condition. First, they employed both whole-body and myeloid cell-specific miR-26b KO mice and observed elevated hepatic steatosis features in these mice compared to WT controls when subjected to WTD. Moreover, livers from whole-body miR-26b KO mice also displayed increased levels of inflammation and fibrosis markers. Kinase activity profiling analyses revealed distinct alterations, particularly in kinases associated with inflammatory pathways, in these samples. Treatment with LNPs containing miR-26b mimics restored lipid metabolism and kinase activity in these animals. Finally, similar anti-inflammatory effects were observed in the livers of individuals with cirrhosis, whereas elevated miR-26b levels were found in the plasma of these patients in comparison with healthy control. Overall, the authors conclude that miR-26b plays a protective role in MASH and that its delivery via LNPs efficiently mitigates MASH development.</p><p>The study has some strengths, most notably, its employ of a combination of animal models, analyses of potential underlying mechanisms, as well as innovative treatment delivery methods with significant promise. However, it also presents numerous weaknesses that leave the research work somewhat incomplete. The precise role of miR-26b in a human context remains elusive, hindering direct translation to clinical practice. Additionally, the evaluation of the kinase activity, although innovative, does not provide a clear molecular mechanisms-based explanation behind the protective role of this miRNA.</p><p>Therefore, to fortify the solidity of their conclusions, these concerns require careful attention and resolution. Once these issues are comprehensively addressed, the study stands to make a significant impact on the field.</p></disp-quote><p>We would like the reviewer for his/her careful evaluation of our manuscript and appreciate his/her appraisal for the strengths of our study. Regarding the weaknesses, we have addressed these as good as possible during the revision of our manuscript.</p><p>We can already state that miR-26b has clear anti-inflammatory effects on human liver slices, which is in line with our results demonstrating that miR-26b plays a protective role in MASH development in mice. The notion that patients with liver cirrhosis have increasing plasma levels of miR-26b, seems contradictory at first glance. However, we believe that this increased miR-26b expression is a compensatory mechanism to counteract the MASH/cirrhotic effects. However, the exact source of this miR-26b remains to be elucidated in future studies.</p><p>The performed kinase activity analysis revealed that miR-26b affects kinases that particularly play an important role in inflammation and angiogenesis. Strikingly and supporting these data, these effects could be inverted again by LNP treatment. Combined, these results already provide strong mechanistic insights on molecular and intracellular signalling level. Although the exact target of miR-26b remains elusive and its identification is probably beyond the scope of the current manuscript due to its complexity, we believe that the kinase activity results already provide a solid mechanistic basis.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p><bold>Reviewer #1 (Recommendations For The Authors):</bold></p><p>A list of recommendations for the authors is presented below:</p><p>(1) The title should emphasize that the majority of experiments were conducted in mice to accurately reflect the scope of the study.</p></disp-quote><p>As suggested we have updated our title to include the statement that we primarily used a murine model:</p><p>“MicroRNA-26b protects against MASH development in mice and can be efficiently targeted with lipid nanoparticles.”</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>(2) It would be useful to know more about miR-26b function, including its target genes, tissue-specific expression, and tissue vs. circulating levels. Is it expected that the two strains of the miRNA (i.e., -3p and -5p) act this similarly? Also, miR-26b expression in the liver of individuals with cirrhosis should be determined.</p></disp-quote><p>The function of miR-26b is still rather elusive, making functional studies using this miR very interesting. In a previous study, describing our used mouse model (Van der Vorst et al. BMC Genom Data, 2021) we have eluded several functions of miR-26b that are already investigated. This was particularly already described in carcinogenesis and the neurological field.</p><p>Target gene wise, there are already several targets described in miRbase. However, for our experiments we feel that determination of the specific target genes is beyond the scope of the current manuscript and rather a focus of follow-up projects.</p><p>Regarding the expression of miR-26b, the liver and blood have rather high and similar expressions of both miR-26b-3p and miR-26b-5p as shown in Author response image 1.</p><p>Expression of miR-26b-3p and -5p. Expression of miR-26b-3p (left) and miR-26b-5p (right), generated by using the miRNATissueAtlas 2025 (Rishik et al. Nucleic Acids Research, 2024).</p><p>Unfortunately, due to restrictions in tissue availability and the lack of stored RNA samples, we are unable to measure miR-26b expression in the human livers. However, based on the potency of the miR-26b mimic loaded LNPs in the mice (Revised Supplemental Figure 2A-B), we are confident that these LNPs also resulted in a overexpression of miR-26b in the human livers.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>(3) Please explain the rationale behind primarily using whole-body miR-26b KO mice rather than the myeloid cell-specific KO model for the studies.</p></disp-quote><p>The main goal of our study is the elucidation of the general role of miR-26b in MASH formation. Therefore, we decided to primarily focus on the whole-body KO model. While we used the myeloid cell-specific KO model to highlight that myeloid cells play an important role in the observed phenotypes, we believe the whole-body KO model is more appropriate as main focus, particularly also in light of the used LNP targeting that also provides a whole-body approach. Furthermore, this focus on the whole-body model also reflects a more therapeutically relevant approach.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>(4) The authors claim that treatment with LNPs containing miR-26b &quot;replenish the miR-26b level in the whole-body deficient mouse&quot; but the results of this observation are not presented.</p></disp-quote><p>This is indeed a valid point that we have now addressed. We have measured the mir26b-3p and mir26b-5p expression levels in livers from mice after 4-week WTD with simultaneous injection with either empty LNPs as vehicle control (eLNP) or LNPs containing miR-26b mimics (mLNP) every 3 days. As shown in Revised Supplemental Figure 2A-B, mLNP treatment clearly results in an overexpression of the mir26b in the livers of these mice. We have rephrased the text accordingly by stating that mLNP results in an “overexpression” rather than “replenishment”.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>(5) The number of 3 human donors for the precision-cut liver slices is clearly insufficient and clinical parameters need to be shown. Additionally, inconsistencies in individual values in Figures 8B-E need clarification.</p></disp-quote><p>Unfortunately, due to restrictions in tissue availability, we are unable to increase our n-number for these experiments. Clinical parameters are not available, but the liver slices were from healthy tissue.</p><p>We have performed these experiments in duplicates for each individual donor. We have now specified this also in the figure legend to explain the individual values in the graphs:</p><p>“…(3 individual donors, cultured in duplicates).”</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>(6) Figure 2D: Please include representative images.</p></disp-quote><p>As suggested we have included representative images in our revised manuscript.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>(7) Address discrepancies in the findings across different experimental settings. For example, the expression levels of the lipid metabolism-related genes are not significantly modulated in whole-body miR-26b KO mice (except for Sra), but they are in the myeloid cell-specific model (but not Sra), and none of them are restored after LNPs injections.</p></disp-quote><p>Although <italic>Cd36</italic> is not significantly increased in the whole-body miR-26b KO mice, there is a clear tendency towards increased expression, which is now also validated on protein level (Revised Figure 1K-L). In the myeloid cell-specific model we see a similar tendency, although the gene expression difference of <italic>Sra</italic> is not significantly changed. This could be due to the difference in the model, since only myeloid cells are affected, suggesting that the effects on <italic>Sra</italic> are to a large extend driven by non-myeloid cells. This would also fit to the tendency to decreased <italic>Sra</italic> expression in the mimic-LNP treated mice. Due to the larger variation, this difference did not reach significance, which is rather a statistical issue due to relatively small n-numbers. At this moment, we cannot exclude that these receptors are differentially regulated by different cell-types. For this, future studies are needed focussing on cell-specific targeting of miR-26b in somatic cells, like hepatocytes.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>(8) Figure 4A the images are not representative of the quantification.</p></disp-quote><p>We have selected another representative image that is exactly reflecting the average Sirius red positive area, to reflect the quantification appropriately.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>(9) Figures 5 and 7: Are there not significantly decreased/increased kinases? A deeper analysis of these kinase alterations is necessary to understand how miR-26b exerts its role. A comparison analysis of these two datasets might clarify this regard.</p></disp-quote><p>We indeed very often see in these kinome analysis that the general tendency of kinase activity is unidirectional. We believe that this is caused by the highly interconnected nature of kinases. Activation of one signalling cascade will also results in the activation of many other cascades. However, it is interesting to see which pathways are affected in our study and we find it particularly interesting to see that the tendencies is exactly opposite between both comparisons as KO vs. WT shows increase kinase activities, while KO-LNP vs. KO shows a decrease again.

More extensive findings are needed to conclusively demonstrate the effectiveness of this treatment method.

However, it seems that the treatment time was not long enough to see pronounced changes on these later stages of disease development. Interestingly, the expression of <italic>Tgfb</italic> was significantly reduced, suggesting at least that the LNPs on genetic levels have an effect already on fibrotic processes. Thereby, it can be suggested that longer mLNP treatment may result in more effects on protein level as well, which remains to be determined in future studies.</p><p>Unfortunately, due to restrictions in tissue availability, we are unable to increase our n-number or read-outs for these experiments at this moment.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>(11) In Figures 8F-H, the observed increase in circulating miR-26b levels in the plasma of cirrhotic individuals seems contradictory to its proposed protective role.

In addition, the authors provide a rescue of the miR-26b using lipid nanoparticles (LNPs), with potential therapeutic implications. In addition, the authors provide useful insights into the role of macrophages and some validation of the effect of miR-26b LNPs on human liver samples.</p><p>Strengths:</p><p>The authors provide a well-designed mouse model, that aims to characterize the role of miR-26b in a mouse model of metabolic dysfunction-associated steatohepatitis (MASH) generated by a Western-type diet on the background of Apoe knock-out. The rescue of the phenotypes associated with the model used using miR-26b using lipid nanoparticles (LNPs) provides an interesting avenue to novel potential therapeutic avenues.</p><p>Weaknesses:</p><p>Although the authors provide a new and interesting avenue to understand the role of miR-26b in MASH, the study needs some additional validations and mechanistic insights in order to strengthen the author's conclusions.</p><p>(1) Analysis of the expression of miRNAs based on miRNA-seq of human samples (see <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://ccb-compute.cs.uni-saarland.de/isomirdb/mirnas">https://ccb-compute.cs.uni-saarland.de/isomirdb/mirnas</ext-link>) suggests that miR-26b-5p is highly abundant both on liver and blood. It seems hard to reconcile that despite miRNA abundance being similar in both tissues, the physiological effects claimed by the authors in Figure 2 come exclusively from the myeloid (macrophages).</p></disp-quote><p>We agree with the reviewer that the effects observed in the whole-body KO model are most likely a combination of cellular effects, particularly since miR-26b is also highly expressed in the liver. However, with the LysM-model we merely want to demonstrate that the myeloid cells at least play an important, though not exclusive, role in the phenotype. In the discussion, we also further elaborate on the fact that the observed changes in the liver can me mediated by hepatic changes.</p><p>To stress this, we have adjusted the conclusion of Figure 2:</p><p>“Interestingly, mice that have a myeloid-specific lack of miR-26b also show increased hepatic cholesterol levels and lipid accumulation demonstrated by Oil-red-O staining, coinciding with an increased hepatic Cd36 expression (Figure 2), demonstrating that myeloid miR-26b plays a major, but not exclusive, role in the observed steatosis.”</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>(2) Similarly, the miRNA-seq expression from isomirdb suggests also that expression of miR-26a-5p is indeed 4-fold higher than miR-26b-5p both in the liver and blood. Since both miRNAs share the same seed sequence, and most of the supplemental regions (only 2 nt difference), their endogenous targets must be highly overlapped. It would be interesting to know whether deletion of miR-26b is somehow compensated by increased expression of miR-26a-5p loci. That would suggest that the model is rather a depletion of miR-26.</p><p>UUCAAGUAAUUCAGGAUAGGU mmu-miR-26b-5p mature miRNA</p><p>UUCAAGUAAUCCAGGAUAGGCU mmu-miR-26a-5p mature miRNA</p></disp-quote><p>This is a very valid point raised by the reviewer, which we actually already explored in a previous study, describing our used mouse model (Van der Vorst et al. BMC Genom Data, 2021). In this manuscript, we could show that miR-26a is not affected by the deficiency of miR-26b (Figure 1G in: Van der Vorst et al. BMC Genom Data, 2021).</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>(3) Similarly, the miRNA-seq expression from isomirdb suggests also that expression of miR-26b-5p is indeed 50-fold higher than miR-26b-3p in the liver and blood. This difference in abundance of the two strands is usually regarded as one of them being the guide strand (in this case the 5p) and the other being the passenger (in this case the 3p). In some cases, passenger strands can be a byproduct of miRNA biogenesis, thus the rescue experiments using LNPs with both strands in equimolar amounts would not reflect the physiological abundance miR-26b-3p. The non-physiological overabundance of miR-26b-3p would constitute a source of undesired off-targets.</p></disp-quote><p>We agree with the reviewer on this aspect and this is something we had to consider while generating the mimic LNPs. However, we believe that we do not observe and undesired off-target effects, as the effects of the mimic LNPs at least on functional outcomes are relatively mild and only restricted to the expected effects on lipids. Furthermore, the effects on the kinase profile due to the mimic LNP treatment are in line with our expectations. Combined these results suggest at least that potential off-target effects are minor.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>(4) It would also be valuable to check the miRNA levels on the liver upon LNP treatment, or at least the signatures of miR-26b-3p and miR-26b-5p activity using RNA-seq on the RNA samples already collected.</p></disp-quote><p>This is indeed a valid point that we have now addressed. We have measured the mir26b-3p and mir26b-5p expression levels in livers from mice after 4-week WTD with simultaneous injection with either empty LNPs as vehicle control (eLNP) or LNPs containing miR-26b mimics (mLNP) every 3 days. As shown in Supplemental Figure 2A-B, mLNP treatment clearly results in an overexpression of the mir26b in the livers of these mice. We have rephrased the text accordingly by stating that mLNP results in an “overexpression” rather than “replenishment”.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>(5) Some of the phenotypes described, such as the increase in cholesterol, overlap with the previous publication by van der Vorst et al. BMC Genom Data (2021), despite in this case the authors are doing their model in Apoe knock-out and Western-type diet. I would encourage the authors to investigate more or discuss why the initial phenotypes don't become more obvious despite the stressors added in the current manuscript.</p></disp-quote><p>In our previous publication (BMC Genom Data; 2021), we actually did not see any changes in circulating lipid levels. However, in that study we did not evaluate the livers of the mice, so we do not have any information about the hepatic lipid levels.</p><p>As mentioned by the reviewer, we believe that we see much more pronounced phenotypes in the current model because we use the combined stressor of <italic>Apoe-/-</italic> and Western-type diet, which cannot be compared to the wildtype and chow-fed mice used in the BMC Genom Data manuscript.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>(6) The authors have focused part of their analysis on a few gene makers that show relatively modest changes. Deeper characterization using RNA-seq might reveal other genes that are more profoundly impacted by miR-26 depletion. It would strengthen the conclusions proposed if the authors validated that changes in mRNA abundance (Sra, Cd36) do impact the protein abundance. These relatively small changes or trends in mRNA expression, might not translate into changes in protein abundance.</p></disp-quote><p>As suggested by the reviewer we have now also confirmed that the protein expression of CD36 and SRA is significantly increased upon miR-26b depletion, visualized as Figure 1K-L in the revised manuscript. Unfortunately, we do not have enough material left to perform similar analysis for the LysM-model or the LNP-model, although based on the whole-body effects we are confident that at least for CD36/SRA in this case the gene expression matches effects observed on protein level.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>(7) In Figures 5 and 7, the authors run a phosphorylation array (STK) to analyze the changes in the activity of the kinome. It seems that a relatively large number of signaling pathways are being altered, I think that should be strengthened by further validations by Western blot on the collected tissue samples. For quite a few of the kinases, there might be antibodies that recognise phosphorylation. The two figures lack a mechanistic connection to the rest of the manuscript.</p><p>On this point we respectfully have to disagree with the reviewer. We have used a kinase activity profiling approach (PamGene) to analyse the real-time activity of kinases in our lysates. This approach is different than the classical Western blot approach in which only the presence or absence of a specific phosphorylation is detected. Thereby, Western blot analysis does not analyse phosphorylation in real-time, but rather determines whether there has been phosphorylation in the past. Our approach actually determines the real-time, current activity of the kinases, which we believe is a different and perhaps even more reliable read-out measurement. Therefore, validation by Western blot would not strengthen these observations.</p></disp-quote><p>We have particularly tried to connect these observations to the rest of the manuscript by highlighting the observed signalling cascades that are affected, highlighting a role in inflammation and angiogenesis, thereby providing some mechanistic insights.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p><bold>Reviewer #2 (Recommendations For The Authors):</bold></p><p>I would encourage the authors to follow-up on some of the more miRNA focused comments made above, which would strengthen the mechanistic part of the work presented.</p><p>I suggest the authors tone down some of some of the claims made (eg. &quot;clearly increased expression&quot;, &quot;exacerbated hepatic fibrosis&quot;), given that some of it might need further validation.</p></disp-quote><p>Wherever needed we have tuned down the tone of some claims, although we believe that most claims are already written carefully enough and in line with the observed results.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Some of the panels that are supposed to have the same amount of animals have variable N, despite they come from the same exact number of RNA samples or tissue lysates (eg. 1G and 1H, vs 1I and 1J).</p></disp-quote><p>This is indeed correct and caused by the fact that some analysis resulted in statistical outliers as identified using the ROUT = 1 method, as also specified in section 2.15 of the method section.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>It would be nice to have representative images of oil-red-o in all the figures where it is quantified (or at least in the supplementary figures).</p></disp-quote><p>As suggested by the reviewer, we have now included representative images for the LysM-model (Revised Figure 2D) and the LNP-model (Revised Figure 6D) as well.</p></body></sub-article></article>
