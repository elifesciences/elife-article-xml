pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.29292.001</object-id><p>Low-density lipoprotein receptor-related protein 1 (LRP1) is a multifunctional cell surface receptor with diverse physiological roles, ranging from cellular uptake of lipoproteins and other cargo by endocytosis to sensor of the extracellular environment and integrator of a wide range of signaling mechanisms. As a chylomicron remnant receptor, LRP1 controls systemic lipid metabolism in concert with the LDL receptor in the liver, whereas in smooth muscle cells (SMC) LRP1 functions as a co-receptor for TGFβ and PDGFRβ in reverse cholesterol transport and the maintenance of vascular wall integrity. Here we used a knockin mouse model to uncover a novel atheroprotective role for LRP1 in macrophages where tyrosine phosphorylation of an NPxY motif in its intracellular domain initiates a signaling cascade along an LRP1/SHC1/PI3K/AKT/PPARγ/LXR axis to regulate and integrate cellular cholesterol homeostasis through the expression of the major cholesterol exporter ABCA1 with apoptotic cell removal and inflammatory responses.</p></abstract><abstract abstract-type="executive-summary"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.29292.002</object-id><title>eLife digest</title><p>Atherosclerosis is a disease in which “plaques” build up inside the walls of arteries. Plaques consist of a fatty substance called cholesterol, together with immune cells such as macrophages and other material from the blood. Over time, the plaque narrows and hardens the arteries. This restricts the flow of blood to vital parts of the body, which increases the risk of heart attacks, strokes and other severe conditions.</p><p>Macrophages play an important role in atherosclerosis. At the early stage of the disease, macrophages enter the developing plaques to take up the excess cholesterol. Cholesterol taken up by macrophages needs to be exported out of the cell and sent to the liver for removal. Yet, these processes can go awry. Macrophages can fill up with too much cholesterol and become trapped in the arteries. These cholesterol-laden macrophages can also start dying. These problems enable the plaques to grow and worsen the disease.</p><p>LRP1 is an important protein present on the surface of many types of cells. In macrophages, LRP1 helps to export excess cholesterol out of the cell, thus lowering the risk of atherosclerosis. LRP1 also reduces cell death in the plaque, which slows the plaques’ progression. Previous research has shown that the region of LRP1 present inside the cell can be modified by the attachment of a phosphate group – a process termed phosphorylation. Whether phosphorylation of LRP1 plays a role in preventing atherosclerosis is not understood.</p><p>To address this question, Xian, Ding, Dieckmann et al. engineered mice in which LRP1 was unable to get phosphorylated. The results show that phosphorylated LRP1 – but not the non-phosphorylated version – turns on a signaling pathway in macrophages. This pathway increases the expression of a transporter protein that exports cholesterol out of the cell. This reduces the amount of cholesterol that accumulates in macrophages. Lastly, mice with problems with LRP1 phosphorylation developed more severe atherosclerotic plaques with more dying cells present in the affected areas compared to normal mice.</p><p>These findings show how phosphorylation of LRP1 protects against atherosclerosis. Understanding this process in further detail may help scientists to devise new ways to treat this disease.</p></abstract><kwd-group

id="s1" sec-type="intro"><title>Introduction</title><p>Atherosclerosis is a chronic condition characterized by impairments in three major processes: systemic and cellular cholesterol homeostasis, inflammation, and apoptosis/efferocytosis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Libby et al., 2011</xref>). Essential roles for the multifunctional transmembrane protein LDL receptor-related-protein 1 (LRP1) have been reported for each of these three processes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Boucher et al., 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Boucher et al., 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">El Asmar et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Mantuano et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib50">Subramanian et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib67">Zhou et al., 2009a</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib70">Zurhove et al., 2008</xref>). Together with LDLR, LRP1 regulates the clearance of circulating cholesterol-rich remnant proteins by hepatocytes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">Rohlmann et al., 1998</xref>). LRP1 is also a key regulator of intracellular cholesterol accumulation in macrophages and smooth muscle cells (SMCs) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Boucher et al., 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Lillis et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib67">Zhou et al., 2009a</xref>). In SMCs, LRP1 functions as a co-receptor with platelet-derived growth factor receptor (PDGFRβ), which in turn activates inflammatory and pro-thrombotic processes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Boucher et al., 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Loukinova et al., 2002</xref>). LRP1 itself has also been implicated in limiting cellular inflammatory responses (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Mantuano et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib70">Zurhove et al., 2008</xref>), and the dual role of LRP1 in cholesterol homeostasis and inflammation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">El Asmar et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib60">Woldt et al., 2011</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib61">2012</xref>) was recently demonstrated in an adipocyte-specific LRP1-deficient mouse model (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Konaniah et al., 2017</xref>). Finally, LRP1 is necessary for efficient efferocytosis in macrophages and dendritic cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib50">Subramanian et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib63">Yancey et al., 2010</xref>).</p><p>LRP1 is ubiquitously expressed, but how it affects cellular signaling mechanisms can differ substantially in a cell-type dependent manner. In SMCs, LRP1 regulates ERK1/2 activation, which leads to increased cPLA2 phosphorylation and release of arachidonic acid (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Graves et al., 1996</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Lin et al., 1992</xref>), a suppressor of LXR-driven ATP-binding cassette transporter A1 (ABCA1) expression (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">DeBose-Boyd et al., 2001</xref>), thereby increasing SMC intracellular cholesterol accumulation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib67">Zhou et al., 2009a</xref>). ABCA1, however, mediates not just reverse cholesterol export, it also regulates cellular inflammatory responses (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Ito et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib53">Tang et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib69">Zhu et al., 2010</xref>). This suggests the presence of an LRP1/LXR/ABCA1 axis that controls and integrates cellular cholesterol export and inflammatory responses.</p><p>One of the atheroprotective roles of LRP1 in the vascular wall is the regulation of the well-established mitogenic pathway mediated by platelet derived growth factor (PDGF), which promotes atherosclerosis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">Ross, 1993</xref>). Mitogenic signaling is commonly associated with tyrosine phosphorylation, and stimulation of PDGFRβ with PDGF-BB induces tyrosine phosphorylation of LRP1 by Src-family tyrosine kinases at the distal cytoplasmic NPxY motif (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Barnes et al., 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Boucher et al., 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Loukinova et al., 2002</xref>). This phosphorylation event can either promote or inhibit the association of the LRP1-ICD (intracellular domain) with several intracellular adaptor proteins, which in turn modulates down-stream signaling cascades (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Gotthardt et al., 2000</xref>). However, the physiological significance of LRP1 NPxY phosphorylation has remained unclear.</p><p>To investigate this role of LRP1 tyrosine phosphorylation in atherosclerosis, we developed a knock-in mouse model in which the tyrosine in the distal NPxY motif was replaced with phenylalanine (<italic>Lrp1<sup>Y63F</sup></italic>), thereby disabling Lrp1 NPxY phosphorylation while leaving the interaction with phosphotyrosine-independent PTB-domain containing adaptor proteins intact (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Gotthardt et al., 2000</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib56">Trommsdorff et al., 1998</xref>). We found that LRP1 NPxY phosphorylation induces a molecular switch of associated cytoplasmic adaptor proteins away from endocytosis-promoting DAB2 to the well-known signal-transducer SHC1. SHC1 is an evolutionarily conserved adaptor protein that mediates mitogenic signaling (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Dieckmann et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">Pelicci et al., 1992</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib59">van der Geer, 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib57">van der Geer and Pawson, 1995</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib58">van der Geer et al., 1995</xref>) and is required for LRP1-dependent signal transduction in SMC through activation of PI3K and phosphorylation of AKT (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Gu et al., 2000</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">Radhakrishnan et al., 2008</xref>). Surprisingly, lack of LRP1 tyrosine phosphorylation was inconsequential in SMCs.

Whether these mechanisms, which are distinct from the Src kinase family-mediated activation of the LRP1/Shc1 signaling cascade, are themselves also modulated by LRP1 tyrosine phosphorylation remains currently unknown, but can now be tested using the knockin mouse model we have reported here.</p><p>Our results, which show an identical atherogenic lipoprotein profile upon cholesterol-feeding of <italic>Ldlr<sup>−/−</sup></italic> mice transplanted with <italic>Ldlr<sup>−/−</sup></italic> or <italic>Lrp1<sup>Y63F</sup>;Ldlr<sup>−/−</sup></italic> bone marrow, differ on first glance from those of Bi et al. (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Bi et al., 2014</xref>), who showed reduced plasma lipid levels in mice lacking Abca1 completely in their monocytes/macrophages. This effectively negated the proatherogenic effect of <italic>Abca1</italic> deficiency in lesion macrophages. In their model, however, elevated plasma cholesterol levels induced by cholesterol feeding and the resulting cholesterol overload of circulating cells led to the secretion of inflammatory cytokines, which reduced VLDL secretion by the liver and thus resulted in a less atherogenic plasma lipid profile, which subsided on a low cholesterol chow diet. In our case, monocyte/macrophages carrying the Y63F mutation in <italic>Lrp1</italic> retain residual, though substantially lower, Abca1 expression, which would protect the circulating cells from cholesterol overload in a hyperlipidemic, cholesterol-fed state.</p><p>In conclusion, our current studies have revealed a novel mechanism through which macrophage LRP1 not only regulates ABCA1 expression to maintain cholesterol efflux, but also integrates cellular cholesterol homeostasis with inflammation and efferocytosis. In aggregate, these macrophage-specific processes demonstrate the atheroprotective role of LRP1 in mechanisms distinct from those found in SMCs. Together, these results underscore the cell-specific nature of LRP1-mediated signaling and highlight the central role of LRP1 in integrating cellular cholesterol homeostasis with other atheroprotective processes.</p></sec><sec id="s4" sec-type="materials|methods"><title>Materials and methods</title><sec id="s4-1"><title>Materials</title><p>The PPARγ inhibitor T0070907 (cat# T8703), LXR activator T0901317 (cat# T2320), LXR 623 (ApexBio), Rosiglitizone (cat# R2408), LY294002 (cat# L9908), and Akt inhibitor 1,3-dihydro-1-(1-((4-(6-phenyl-1H-imidazo[4,5-g]quinoxalin-7-yl)phenyl)methyl)-4-piperidinyl-2H-bezimidazole-2-one trifluoroacetate salt hydrate (cat# A6730), and In Situ Cell Death Detection Kit, TMR red (cat# 12156792910) were purchased from Sigma-Aldrich (St. Louis, MO).

The first decision letter after peer review is shown below.]</p><p>Thank you for choosing to send your work entitled &quot;Tyrosine phosphorylation of the LRP1 intracellular domain regulates macrophage ABCA1 expression&quot; for consideration at <italic>eLife</italic>. Your full submission has been evaluated by Gary Westbrook (Senior editor) and three peer reviewers, one of whom is a member of our Board of Reviewing Editors, and the decision was reached after discussions between the reviewers. Based on our discussions and the individual reviews below, we regret to inform you that your work will not be considered further for publication in <italic>eLife</italic>.</p><p>The reviewers appreciated the effort involved in the creation of the Lrp-1 mutant knock-in mice, and commented that the work described was of high quality.

Your article has been reviewed by three peer reviewers, and the evaluation has been overseen by a Reviewing Editor and a Senior Editor. The reviewers have opted to remain anonymous. Our decision has been reached after consultation between the reviewers. Based on these discussions and the individual reviews below, we regret to inform you that your work will not be considered further for publication in <italic>eLife</italic>.</p><p>Summary</p><p>The reviewers recognized and applauded the considerable amount of experimental data in this paper, but they were skeptical that the significant decrease in atherosclerosis in the mutant LRP mouse could be explained by changes in ABCA1 expression. Studies by the laboratory of John Parks have suggested that the impact of macrophage ABCA1 deficiency on atherosclerosis are modest. Addressing this issue in a definitive fashion would necessitate breeding double knockout mice. Also, the reviewers thought that it would be important to test whether restoring AKT expression would restore the perturbed expression of ABCA1. In online discussions, the reviewers suggested that the impact of the LRP mutation on efferocytosis was not well developed. Finally, multiple reviewers thought that the paper might be better suited for a specialty journal.</p><p>Reviewer #2:</p><p>The authors describe an elegant approach to analyzing the functions of the NPxY motif in the intracellular domain of LRP1 and uncover a number of interesting findings, including well defined lack of Shc1 binding, alterations in plasma lipoproteins and increases in atherosclerosis when mice are challenged with high fat/cholesterol/bile salt diet. Moreover, the increase in atherosclerosis is also seen in a bone marrow transplantation study. The authors also show that the mutation reduces Abca1 expression and impairs AKT responses to oxidized LDL in peritoneal macrophages. However, the main conclusion as stated in the title of the Abstract is not well supported by the data provided.</p><p>1) There is about a 40% reduction in Abca1 mRNA an protein in LRP mutant macrophages. What is Abca1 expression in plaques? The authors cite Aiello et al. who did an ABCA1 bone marrow transplantation study as evidence that macrophage ABCA1 deficiency is sufficient to explain the atherosclerosis phenotype. However, studies which more specifically examined the impact of myeloid/macrophage deficiency of ABCA1 (as opposed to whole bone marrow deficiency) revealed at best a minimal atherosclerosis phenotype (Bi et al., 2014). Thus it is unlikely that reduced macrophage Abca1 can explain the fairly dramatic atherosclerosis findings in the present study. The authors may wish to consider making a compound mouse with both the LRP1 mutation and ABCA1 deficiency if they wish to examine this issue more critically.</p><p>2) While it seems clear that the LRP1 mutation causes a reduced AKT response to oxLDL it is less clear that this causes the reduction in Abca1. The authors use high concentrations of AKT inhibitors to show reductions in Abca1 and there is concern about cell toxicity. In any event, a more informative experiment would be to restore AKT in LRP1 mutant cells (e.g. using Myr-AKT) to see if that reverses the defect in Abca1.</p><p>3) Information on sex, genetic background and housing of mice (littermates together?) does not seem to be provided. This is especially important for atherosclerosis studies.</p><p>4) Necrotic core area increase is proportional to the overall increase in lesion size. More direct methods to assess efferocytosis in plaques could be used if the authors feel this is an important part of the paper.</p><p>Reviewer #3:</p><p>I read carefully the responses to my original comments and also read the responses to the other reviewers. In general, the authors have tried to be very responsive, especially in regard to providing data to support their points and to address the issues raised. I feel that in the area of efferocytosis, some rigor is still lacking. They note that MerTK expression is lower, and state that the decrease in efferocytosis is likely attributed to Mertk dysfunction. Likely is not a direct link, and even if this were true, the mechanism linking the mutation in Lrp1 to decreased MerTK expression and possible function is not shown.</p><p>Reviewer #4:</p><p>The authors have addressed all of the comments I had raised and have produced a monumentally large revised manuscript that challenges the reader's attention span and is overly rich in figures. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figures 4</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">6</xref> and panel B of <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig13">13</xref> are not essential.</p></body></sub-article><sub-article article-type="reply" id="SA2"><front-stub><article-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.29292.019</article-id><title-group><article-title>Author response</article-title></title-group></front-stub><body><p>[Editors’ note: the author responses to the first round of peer review follow.]</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Reviewer #1:</p><p>In this manuscript, the authors created a knock in mouse model expressing LRP1 lacking tyrosine phosphorylation (Y63F) in its NPxY motif.

Previous studies in SMCs demonstrated that LRP1 was critical for PDGF-induced cell proliferation and migration. We initially hypothesized that this may be dependent upon tyrosine phosphorylation of the LRP1 cytoplasmic domain. Therefore, we used the Transwell Migration assay and BrdU Proliferation Assay to compare the migratory and proliferative response of primary aortic smooth muscle cells explanted from wild type or LRP1<sup>Y63F</sup> mice to PDGFβ or TGFβ.

To understand the source of elevated total cholesterol, we performed FPLC lipoprotein analysis, which showed that elevated plasma cholesterol levels in LRP1<sup>Y63F</sup>;LDLR<sup>-/-</sup> mice fed with HCHF diet were attributed to increased VLDL-cholesterol with slightly reduced LDL- and HDL-cholesterol contents (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="respfig1">Author response image 1A</xref>). Moreover, plasma apoB48 concentrations were markedly increased, with a shift toward larger sizes of VLDL/LDL-containing fractions in LRP1<sup>Y63F</sup>;LDLR<sup>-/-</sup> mice compared to LDLR<sup>-/-</sup> mice on HCHF diet. These results suggested that the LRP1 Y63F mutation resulted in a modest decreased clearance of postprandial lipids.</p><p>To definitively demonstrate that the proatherogenic phenotype is due to macrophage pathology rather than elevated plasma cholesterol levels, we generated a bone marrow transplant model wherein LDLR<sup>-/-</sup> or LRP1<sup>Y63F</sup>;LDLR<sup>-/-</sup> bone-marrow derived mononuclear cells were transplanted into irradiated LDLR<sup>-/-</sup> mice. These mice were then fed a HCHF diet for 16 weeks.</p><p>As shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6A</xref>, HCHF diet resulted in very high plasma cholesterol levels after radiation in all mice. However, there was no difference in plasma lipid and apolipoprotien levels between LDLR<sup>-/</sup>→LDLR<sup>-/-</sup> and LRP1<sup>Y63F</sup>;LDLR<sup>-/-</sup>→LDLR<sup>-/-</sup> mice (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="respfig1">Author response image 1B</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6 B, C, D</xref>).

This suggested that the difference in lipid profiles seen in LDLR<sup>-/-</sup> vs. LRP1<sup>Y63F</sup>;LDLR<sup>-/-</sup> mice is due to the effect of the systemic LRP1<sup>Y63F</sup> mutation in the liver. Since LRP1 is involved in hepatic chylomicron clearance as well as ABCA1 expression, and ABCA1 is substantially reduced in Y63F mutant livers (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7</xref>), we suspect that the modest difference in the lipoprotein profiles is mostly due to these mutation-induced changes of hepatic LPR1 function and the concomitant reduction in ABCA1 expression in the liver, which generates a hypomorphic Tangier phenotype. The molecular mechanism leading to these changes in liver function will require further extensive studies, which will become the focus of one or more independent manuscripts.</p><fig id="respfig1"><label>Author response image 1.</label><graphic mime-subtype="jpeg" mimetype="image" xlink:href="elife-29292-resp-fig1-v1"/></fig><p>As shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8">Figure 8</xref>, despite the dramatically elevated cholesterol levels in both LDLR<sup>-/-</sup>→LDLR<sup>-/-</sup> and LRP1<sup>Y63F</sup>;LDLR<sup>-/-</sup>→LDLR<sup>-/-</sup> mice on HCHF diet, only the LRP1<sup>Y63F</sup>;LDLR<sup>-/-</sup>→LDLR<sup>-/-</sup> on HCHF diet developed severe atherosclerosis (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="respfig2">Author response image 2A and B</xref>).

LRP1 tyrosine phosphorylation is necessary for interaction with Shc1, which in turn activates PI3K/Akt signaling. Phospho-Akt modulates PPARγ/LXR driven Abca1 gene transcription and is necessary for the full effect of ox-LDL and PPARγ/LXR induced expression of ABCA1 to mediate cholesterol efflux. Inhibition of PI3K/Akt (using LY294002 or Akt inhibitor) results in only partial induction of Abca1 in response to ox-LDL and PPARγ/LXR agonists (rosiglitazone, T0901317, LXR623). (B) In the absence of LRP1 tyrosine phosphorylation, as in the case of the LRP1Y63F mutation, Dab2 rather than Shc1 associates with LRP1. Lack of the interaction with Shc1 decreases p-Akt, which in turn decreases Abca1 gene transcription, even in the presence of ox-LDL and PPARγ/LXR agonists, similar to what is observed in LRP1 wild type cells treated with PI3K/Akt inhibitors. Ultimately, decreased ABCA1 expression leads to impaired cholesterol efflux, thus accelerating atherogenesis.</p><p>[Editors' note: the author responses to the re-review follow.]</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Summary</p><p>The reviewers recognized and applauded the considerable amount of experimental data in this paper, but they were skeptical that the significant decrease in atherosclerosis in the mutant LRP mouse could be explained by changes in ABCA1 expression. Studies by the laboratory of John Parks have suggested that the impact of macrophage ABCA1 deficiency on atherosclerosis are modest. Addressing this issue in a definitive fashion would necessitate breeding double knockout mice. Also, the reviewers thought that it would be important to test whether restoring AKT expression would restore the perturbed expression of ABCA1. In online discussions, the reviewers suggested that the impact of the LRP mutation on efferocytosis was not well developed. Finally, multiple reviewers thought that the paper might be better suited for a specialty journal.</p><p>Reviewer #2:</p><p>The authors describe an elegant approach to analyzing the functions of the NPxY motif in the intracellular domain of LRP1 and uncover a number of interesting findings, including well defined lack of Shc1 binding, alterations in plasma lipoproteins and increases in atherosclerosis when mice are challenged with high fat/cholesterol/bile salt diet. Moreover, the increase in atherosclerosis is also seen in a bone marrow transplantation study. The authors also show that the mutation reduces Abca1 expression and impairs AKT responses to oxidized LDL in peritoneal macrophages. However, the main conclusion as stated in the title of the Abstract is not well supported by the data provided.</p><p>1) There is about a 40% reduction in Abca1 mRNA an protein in LRP mutant macrophages. What is Abca1 expression in plaques? The authors cite Aiello et al. who did an ABCA1 bone marrow transplantation study as evidence that macrophage ABCA1 deficiency is sufficient to explain the atherosclerosis phenotype. However, studies which more specifically examined the impact of myeloid/macrophage deficiency of ABCA1 (as opposed to whole bone marrow deficiency) revealed at best a minimal atherosclerosis phenotype (Bi et al., 2014). Thus it is unlikely that reduced macrophage Abca1 can explain the fairly dramatic atherosclerosis findings in the present study. The authors may wish to consider making a compound mouse with both the LRP1 mutation and ABCA1 deficiency if they wish to examine this issue more critically.</p><p>2) While it seems clear that the LRP1 mutation causes a reduced AKT response to oxLDL it is less clear that this causes the reduction in Abca1. The authors use high concentrations of AKT inhibitors to show reductions in Abca1 and there is concern about cell toxicity. In any event, a more informative experiment would be to restore AKT in LRP1 mutant cells (e.g. using Myr-AKT) to see if that reverses the defect in Abca1.</p><p>3) Information on sex, genetic background and housing of mice (littermates together?) does not seem to be provided. This is especially important for atherosclerosis studies.</p><p>4) Necrotic core area increase is proportional to the overall increase in lesion size. More direct methods to assess efferocytosis in plaques could be used if the authors feel this is an important part of the paper.</p><p>Reviewer #3:</p><p>I read carefully the responses to my original comments and also read the responses to the other reviewers. In general, the authors have tried to be very responsive, especially in regard to providing data to support their points and to address the issues raised. I feel that in the area of efferocytosis, some rigor is still lacking. They note that MerTK expression is lower, and state that the decrease in efferocytosis is likely attributed to Mertk dysfunction. Likely is not a direct link, and even if this were true, the mechanism linking the mutation in Lrp1 to decreased MerTK expression and possible function is not shown.</p><p>Reviewer #4:</p><p>The authors have addressed all of the comments I had raised and have produced a monumentally large revised manuscript that challenges the reader's attention span and is overly rich in figures. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figures 4</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">6</xref> and panel B of <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig13">13</xref> are not essential.</p></disp-quote><p>First, I want to thank you for giving us the opportunity to resubmit our manuscript formerly entitled “Phosphorylation of the LRP1 NPxY motif protects against atherosclerosis by regulating macrophage cholesterol export” and now entitled “LRP1 integrates macrophage cholesterol homeostasis and inflammatory responses in atherosclerosis”. Next, I should apologize if you found the tone of my previous letter not appropriate or helpful. It was borne out of the frustrations I and my coauthors felt as we were trying to make sense of the erratic appearance of the reviewers’ criticism, who appeared to question the role of ABCA1 in reverse cholesterol transport and atherosclerosis while every single published paper we were able to find reported the exact opposite, consistent with our own findings. Your editorial summary has now made this a lot clearer and we have revised the manuscript along these lines, after reconfirming and adding additional data to address specific reviewers’ concerns and questions. In addition, and specifically in order to address the misconception that macrophage ABCA1 plays no role in atherosclerosis, I am attaching a clarifying letter by my colleague and coauthor, John Parks, who also is the senior author of the Bi et al. study on which the reviewers had based their assessment. We hope that letter clarifies that our conclusions are in no way in conflict with the Bi et al. study. At this point let me emphasize again: The main thrust of our present manuscript was not to investigate the role of ABCA1 in atherosclerosis, which we had considered a settled issue and for which we have abundantly cited the pertinent literature. The main point of our study was to investigate the consequences of the tyrosine phosphorylation in the cytoplasmic domain of LRP1, which we find protects from atherosclerosis by activating a signaling axis that includes Shc1, PI3K, Akt, and PPARγ and which results in the boosting of the atheroprotective expression of LXR target genes. ABCA1 is a major LXR target and one that has been clearly shown to be atheroprotective by itself in numerous independent studies in the mouse and in humans (including in the Bi et al. study). The major difference between the ABCA1 knockout models, which show reduced VLDL production and thus have a less atherogenic plasma lipoprotein profile, and our LRP1 knockin mouse is that the former are lacking ABCA1 completely in their monocytes/macrophages, while in our model ABCA1 expression is reduced with lower, but clearly present, residual cholesterol export activity. Therefore, circulating monocytes, which do not have to deal with the excessive cholesterol-loading that resident macrophages in atherosclerotic lesions have to cope with, would be less prone to convert to an inflammatory phenotype than monocytes that completely lack ABCA1. In the course of being fed an atherogenic diet high in cholesterol the latter – but not the LRP1 mutant monocyte/macrophages that express ABCA1 merely at a lower level – would be unable to export the excess cholesterol taken up from the circulation through passive or active receptor-mediated mechanisms. This resulted in the increased expression of inflammatory cytokines, which reduced VLDL secretion by the liver through mechanisms that remain incompletely understood. In support of this interpretation of the data, Bi and colleagues found that in the absence of excess cholesterol feeding, inflammatory cytokine expression by genetically ABCA1-deficient monocyte/macrophages subsided, resulting in a normal lipoprotein profile, which now unmasked the previously occluded atheroprotective effect of macrophage ABCA1. The Bi et al. paper clearly states this, as the accompanying letter by Dr. Parks also confirms.</p><p>We hope you and the reviewers will accept this detailed explanation of what the reviewers felt was an apparent conflict with the prior literature. However, there is actually no conflict. While we could put this detailed explanation into the discussion of the manuscript, we feel that this would merely distract from the main topic of the article, which is the tyrosine phosphorylationdependent LRP1 signaling axis, and send the discussion off onto an irrelevant tangent. We have thus addressed this minor issue only briefly by stating “Our results, which show an identical atherogenic lipoprotein profile upon cholesterol-feeding of LDLR<sup>-/-</sup> mice transplanted with LDLR<sup>-/-</sup> or LDLR<sup>-/-</sup>;LRP1<sup>Y63F</sup> bone marrow, differ from those of Bi et al., who showed reduced plasma lipid levels in mice lacking ABCA1 completely in their monocytes/macrophages. In their model, elevated plasma cholesterol levels and the resulting cholesterol overload led to the secretion of inflammatory cytokines, which subsided on a low cholesterol chow diet. In our case, monocyte/macrophages carrying the Y63F mutation in LRP1 retained residual, though substantially lower, ABCA1 expression, which would protect the circulating cells from cholesterol overload in a hyperlipidemic, cholesterol-fed state.”</p><p>In addition to these specific changes, we have substantially rewritten the entire manuscript to emphasize the role of the novel LRP1/Shc/PI3K/Akt/PPARγ/LXR axis in the regulation of atheroprotective gene expression, in complete agreement with the seminal work by Peter Tontonoz and colleagues. We have striven to deemphasize the spotlight which was previous focused perhaps too prominently upon ABCA1 and instead have greatly broadened our discussion and interpretation of our results. In addition, we have discussed the documented roles of LRP1 in the suppression of the inflammatory response and in efferocytosis, as so elegantly described by Ira Tabas and his group. In support of our conclusions, especially the role of ABCA1 for the protection from atherosclerosis, we have also cited the comprehensive work and reviews from Alan Tall and colleagues and from Michael Hayden’s group. A fascinating topic, and one we would love to continue to explore, ideally in collaboration with the Tabas laboratory, is the role of the LRP1 tyrosine phosphorylation in efferocytosis. Given the sheer amount of work we have reported here, however, this is unfortunately far beyond the scope of the present study. However, our new animal model, reported here, will now open the door to explore this avenue.</p></body></sub-article></article>
