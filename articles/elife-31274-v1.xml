Upon ovulation, progesterone and rising cellular cAMP levels activate the transcription factor Forkhead box O1 (FOXO1) in endometrial stromal cells (EnSCs), leading to cell cycle exit and differentiation into decidual cells that control embryo implantation. Here we show that FOXO1 also causes acute senescence of a subpopulation of decidualizing EnSCs in an IL-8 dependent manner. Selective depletion or enrichment of this subpopulation revealed that decidual senescence drives the transient inflammatory response associated with endometrial receptivity. Further, senescent cells prevent differentiation of endometrial mesenchymal stem cells in decidualizing cultures. As the cycle progresses, IL-15 activated uterine natural killer (uNK) cells selectively target and clear senescent decidual cells through granule exocytosis. Our findings reveal that acute decidual senescence governs endometrial rejuvenation and remodeling at embryo implantation, and suggest a critical role for uNK cells in maintaining homeostasis in cycling endometrium.</p></abstract><kwd-group kwd-group-type="author-keywords"><kwd>Endometrium</kwd><kwd>Senescence</kwd><kwd>uterine natural killer cells</kwd><kwd>Immunosurveillance</kwd><kwd>Implantation</kwd><kwd>receptivity</kwd></kwd-group><kwd-group kwd-group-type="research-organism"><title>Research organism</title><kwd>Human</kwd></kwd-group><funding-group><award-group id="fund1"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution>Tommy's National Miscarriage Research Centre</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>RMRRH0035</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Vrljicak</surname><given-names>Pavle</given-names></name><name><surname>Tewary</surname><given-names>Shreeya</given-names></name><name><surname>Lucas</surname><given-names>Emma</given-names></name><name><surname>Quenby</surname><given-names>Siobhan</given-names></name><name><surname>Brosens</surname><given-names>Jan Joris</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund2"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution>BioMedical Research Unit in Reproductive Health, University Hospitals Coventry and Warwickshire</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>RMRRH0019</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Brighton</surname><given-names>Paul J</given-names></name><name><surname>Maruyama</surname><given-names>Yojiro</given-names></name><name><surname>Fishwick</surname><given-names>Katherine</given-names></name><name><surname>Fujihara</surname><given-names>Risa</given-names></name><name><surname>Muter</surname><given-names>Joanne</given-names></name><name><surname>Yamada</surname><given-names>Taihei</given-names></name><name><surname>Lucciola</surname><given-names>Raffaella</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><funding-statement>The funders had no role in study design, data collection and interpretation, or the decision to submit the work for publication.</funding-statement></funding-group><custom-meta-group><custom-meta specific-use="meta-only"><meta-name>Author impact statement</meta-name><meta-value>While acute senescence of decidualizing cells drives the inflammatory response underpinning uterine receptivity, subsequent clearance by activated natural killer cells transiently rejuvenates the cycling endometrium, enabling transition into a gestational tissue upon embryo implantation.</meta-value></custom-meta></custom-meta-group></article-meta></front><body><sec id="s1" sec-type="intro"><title>Introduction</title><p>Different mammalian species employ divergent strategies to ensure successful embryo implantation. In mice, synchronized implantation of multiple embryos (average 6–8) is dependent on a transient rise in circulating estradiol (E2) that not only renders the progesterone-primed endometrium receptive, but also activates dormant blastocysts for implantation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Paria et al., 1998</xref>). Upon breaching of the uterine luminal epithelium, implanting murine embryos trigger extensive remodeling of the endometrial stromal compartment. This process, termed decidualization, is characterized by local edema, influx of uNK cells and differentiation of stromal fibroblasts into specialized decidual cells that coordinate trophoblast invasion and placenta formation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Gellersen and Brosens, 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib50">Zhang et al., 2013</xref>). Likewise, the human endometrium transiently expresses a receptive phenotype, lasting 2–4 days, during the mid-luteal phase of the cycle. However, this implantation window is not controlled by a nidatory E2 surge (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">de Ziegler et al., 1992</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Groll et al., 2009</xref>), perhaps reflecting that synchronized implantation of multiple human embryos is neither required nor desirable. Further, decidualization of the stromal compartment is not dependent on an implanting embryo but initiated during the mid-luteal phase of each cycle in response to elevated circulating progesterone levels and increased intracellular cAMP production (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Gellersen and Brosens, 2014</xref>). In parallel, CD56<sup>bright</sup> CD16<sup>−</sup> uNK cells accumulate in luteal phase endometrium. In pregnancy, uNK cells exert an evolutionarily conserved role in orchestrating vascular adaptation and trophoblast invasion (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Hanna et al., 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib48">Xiong et al., 2013</xref>), but their function in cycling human endometrium is unclear.</p><p>Differentiation of human endometrial stromal cells (EnSCs) into decidual cells is a multistep process (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Gellersen and Brosens, 2014</xref>). Following cell cycle exit at G0/G1, decidualizing EnSCs first mount a transient pro-inflammatory response, characterized by a burst of free radical production and secretion of various chemokines and other inflammatory mediators (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Al-Sabbagh et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Lucas et al., 2016b</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib42">Salker et al., 2012</xref>). Exposure of the mouse uterus to this inflammatory secretome activates multiple receptivity genes, suggesting that the nidatory E2 surge in mice is supplanted by an endogenous inflammatory signal in the human uterus. Feedback loops purportedly limit the inflammatory decidual response to 2–4 days (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib42">Salker et al., 2012</xref>). The next decidual phase coincides with embedding of the implanted embryo into the stroma. At this stage, fully differentiated decidual cells, which are now tightly adherent and possess gap junctions (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Laws et al., 2008</xref>), form an immune privileged matrix around the semi-allogenic conceptus (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Erlebacher, 2013</xref>). In the absence of implantation, falling progesterone levels trigger a second inflammatory decidual response which, upon recruitment and activation of leukocytes, leads to tissue breakdown, focal bleeding and menstrual shedding of the superficial endometrial layer. Scar-free tissue repair involves activation of mesenchymal stem-like cells (MSCs) and epithelial progenitor cells that reside in the basal layer (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Evans et al., 2016</xref>). Following menstruation, rising follicular E2 levels drive rapid tissue growth, which over ~10 days increases the thickness of the endometrium several-fold. Clinically, suboptimal endometrial growth is strongly associated with reproductive failure (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib49">Yuan et al., 2016</xref>); but how MSC activation followed by intense proliferation is linked to the decidual process is unclear.</p><p>FOXO1 is a core decidual transcription factor that controls cell cycle exit of EnSCs in response to differentiation signals and activates expression of decidual marker genes, such as <italic>PRL</italic> and <italic>IGFBP1</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">Park et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib44">Takano et al., 2007</xref>). Here we demonstrate that FOXO1 also induces acute senescence in a subpopulation of EnSCs. We show that the senescence-associated secretory phenotype (SASP) drives the initial auto-inflammatory decidual response linked to endometrial receptivity and provide evidence that uNK cells target and eliminate senescent decidual cells as the cycle progresses. Our findings reveal a hitherto unrecognized role for acute cellular senescence in endometrial remodeling at the time of embryo implantation; and suggest a major role for uNK cells in maintaining tissue homeostasis from cycle to cycle.</p></sec><sec id="s2" sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><sec id="s2-1"><title>Decidualization induces acute senescence in a subpopulation of EnSCs</title><p>To determine if cycling human endometrium harbor dynamic populations of senescent cells, we first stained primary EnSC cultures for senescence-associated β-galactosidase (SAβG) activity. At passage 1 (P1), SAβG<sup>+</sup> cells were detectable in variable numbers in different cultures (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1A</xref>). Strikingly, the number of SAβG<sup>+</sup> cells increased markedly upon decidualization with 8-bromo-cAMP and medroxyprogesterone acetate (MPA, a progestin). Typically, SAβG<sup>+</sup> cells formed islets surrounded by SAβG<sup>-</sup> EnSCs in differentiating cultures (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1A</xref>). Quantitative analysis confirmed a time-dependent increase in SAβG activity upon decidualization (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1B</xref>). The abundance of SAβG<sup>+</sup> cells in undifferentiated cultures declined upon passaging of cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1A</xref>). Initially, this was paralleled by a reduction in SAβG activity, which was reversed at later passages (P6) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1B</xref>), presumably reflecting emerging replicative exhaustion of EnSCs (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1C</xref>). However, even after ~60 days in continuous culture, exposure of EnSCs to a deciduogenic stimulus enhanced SAβG activity and triggered the appearance of SAβG<sup>+</sup> cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1A and B</xref>).</p><fig-group><fig id="fig1" position="float"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.31274.002</object-id><label>Figure 1.</label><caption><title>Decidualization induces acute senescence in a subpopulation of EnSCs.</title><p>(<bold>A</bold>) Representative SAβG staining in undifferentiated EnSCs (Day 0) or cells decidualized for the indicated time points with 8-bromo-cAMP and MPA.

Hence, we examined the expression of other putative senescence markers in undifferentiated and decidualizing EnSCs. Many senescence signals converge onto the tumor suppressor protein p53 (p53) and induce the expression of cyclin-dependent kinase (CDK) inhibitors, leading to proliferative arrest and cell cycle exit (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Muñoz-Espín and Serrano, 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib46">van Deursen, 2014</xref>). We reported previously that downregulation of MDM2 proto-oncogene, an E3 ubiquitin ligase, stabilizes p53 in differentiating EnSCs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Pohnke et al., 2004</xref>). Western blot analysis showed that p53 stabilization upon decidualization is paralleled by upregulation of p16<sup>Ink4a</sup> (p16; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1C</xref>), a CDK inhibitor presumed specific for senescence. Notably, confocal microscopy revealed that induction of p16 upon decidualization is confined to a subpopulation of EnSCs (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1D</xref>). Loss of lamin B1 (LMNB1) and high mobility group box 2 (HMGB2) drives many of the chromatin and epigenetic changes that underpin cellular senescence (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Aird et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">Sadaie et al., 2013</xref>). Decidualization resulted in downregulation of both effector proteins and a reciprocal increase in the histone H2A variant macroH2A (mH2A) and trimethylated lysine 9 on histone H3 (H3K9Me3) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1C</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1D</xref>). This histone variant and modification are involved in senescence-associated heterochromatin formation (SAHF). Unexpectedly, the nucleosome linker histone H1 (H.H1), which purportedly is lost in senescent cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Funayama et al., 2006</xref>), was upregulated upon decidualization (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1C</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1D</xref>). These observations were confirmed by immunofluorescence confocal microscopy (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1E</xref>, left panel), which also revealed that the nuclei of EnSC increase in size (~40%) upon decidualization (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1E</xref>, right panel). Next, we examined if the transient inflammatory decidual response also encompasses secreted factors typical of the canonical senescence associated secretory phenotype (SASP). As shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1F</xref>, secretion of IL-8 (CXCL8), GROα (CXCL1), and IL-6 peaked transiently on day 2 of decidualization and returned to baseline by day 4. By day 8, the level of secretion of GROα and IL-6 was lower than that observed in undifferentiated cultures.</p><p>Taken together, the data reveal striking similarities between cellular senescence and differentiation of EnSCs into decidual cells. However, only a subpopulation of EnSCs became strongly SAβG<sup>+</sup> or expressed p16 upon decidualization. Further, while SASP is often a sustained response, decidual inflammation is temporally restricted to 2–4 days.</p></sec><sec id="s2-2"><title>Temporal regulation of senescent cell populations in cycling endometrium</title><p>To extrapolate these observations to the in vivo situation, protein lysates from whole endometrial biopsies were subjected to Western blot analysis. As the cycle progresses from the proliferative to the secretory phase, the abundance of p53, p16, LMNB1, HMBG2, mH2A and H3K9me3 in the endometrium mimicked the changes observed in decidualizing EnSC cultures (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2A</xref>). Further, analysis of snap-frozen biopsies showed a sharp increase in SAβG activity upon transition from proliferative to early-secretory endometrium with levels peaking in the late-luteal phase (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2B</xref>). Disintegration of the stromal compartment upon cryosectioning of frozen tissue samples precluded a meaningful analysis of SAβG<sup>+</sup> cells. Instead, we used immunohistochemistry to examine the abundance and tissue distribution of p16<sup>+</sup> cells in 308 formalin-fixed endometrial biopsies obtained during the peri-implantation window, i.e. 6 to 12 days after the luteinizing hormone (LH) surge (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2C</xref>). The statistical distribution of p16<sup>+</sup> cells in the glandular epithelium, luminal epithelium and stromal compartment is presented as a centile graph (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2D</xref>). Interestingly, p16<sup>+</sup> cells were most prevalent in both the glandular and luminal epithelium at LH + 10 and +11, which coincides with the onset of the late-luteal phase of the cycle. The relative abundance of p16<sup>+</sup> cells was ~10 fold higher in the luminal compared to the glandular compartment. Typically, stretches of p16<sup>+</sup> cells were interspersed by p16<sup>-</sup> cells in the luminal epithelium (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2C</xref>). By contrast, p16<sup>+</sup> cells gradually increased in the stromal compartment during the mid-luteal phase and this was accelerated in late-luteal endometrium.

The second mechanism involves secretion by activated NK cells of granules containing perforin and granzyme (A, B). Perforin forms pores in the plasma membrane of target cells and triggers apoptosis upon release of granzyme into the cytoplasm (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Chowdhury and Lieberman, 2008</xref>). As shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5D</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5s1">Figure 5—figure supplement 1B</xref>, both the pan-caspase inhibitor Z-VAD-FMK and the granzyme B inhibitor 3,4-Dichloroisocoumarin (3,4-DCI) negated the impact of uNK cells on SAβG activity and cell viability in decidualizing cultures. To explore why uNK cell-mediated clearance of SAβG<sup>+</sup> EnSCs is restricted to decidualizing cultures, we focused on IL-15, a pivotal cytokine that regulates NK cell proliferation and activation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Marçais et al., 2014</xref>). IL-15 secretion was below the level of detection in undifferentiated cells but, after a lag-period of 2 days, rose markedly upon decidualization of EnSCs in a time-dependent manner (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5E</xref>). Notably, pretreatment of cultures with dasatinib or palbociclib had no impact on impact on IL-15 secretion, suggesting that differentiated EnSCs orchestrate the uNK-mediated clearance of their senescent counterparts (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5E</xref>). Incubation of co-cultures with an IL-15 blocking antibody antagonized, at least partly, uNK cell-mediated clearance of senescent decidual cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5F</xref>). Furthermore, a blocking antibody against NKG2D (Natural Killer Group 2D), a receptor expressed by all human NK cells and CD8-positive T cells that binds surface ligands expressed on stressed cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib41">Sagiv et al., 2016</xref>), also attenuated uNK cell-mediated killing of senescent decidual cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5s1">Figure 5—figure supplement 1D</xref>).</p></sec><sec id="s2-6"><title>Tissue homeostasis</title><p>Our findings indicate that endometrial homeostasis during the luteal phase is dependent on balancing induction and clearance of senescent decidual cells.

Typically, acute senescent cells produce a context-specific SASP with defined paracrine functions and self-organize their elimination by various immune cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib46">van Deursen, 2014</xref>). Here we provide evidence that acute decidual senescence is a pivotal process that coordinates acquisition of a receptive phenotype with endometrial remodeling and rejuvenation during the implantation process. We reported previously that decidual transformation of primary EnSCs is a stepwise process that starts with a NOX4-dependent burst of free radicals and release of multiple inflammatory mediators (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Al-Sabbagh et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Lucas et al., 2016b</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib42">Salker et al., 2012</xref>). Exposure of the mouse uterus to this inflammatory secretome induced expression of multiple implantation genes and enabled efficient implantation of in vitro cultured mouse embryos (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib42">Salker et al., 2012</xref>). We now demonstrate that this nidatory decidual signal is driven foremost by acute senescence of a subpopulation of EnSCs. The close correlation between SAβG activity before and after decidualization suggests that polarization of EnSCs upon cell cycle exit into differentiating and senescent cells is not stochastic but determined by the level of replicative stress incurred by individual EnSCs during the preceding proliferative phase (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7</xref>). Acute senescence rejuvenates the receptive endometrium through two distinct mechanisms. First, we demonstrated that blocking of decidual senescence with rapamycin or elimination of senescent cells with dasatinib result in loss of clonal MSCs in differentiating EnSC cultures. By contrast, amplification of senescence in response palbociclib treatment consistently increased the clonal cell population. These observations indicate that the decidual SASP not only ‘locks in’ endometrial MSCs upon decidualization but, dependent on the amplitude of the inflammatory response, also de-differentiates more committed cells into clonal MSCs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">de Keizer, 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">Ritschka et al., 2017</xref>). Arguably, an adequate MSC population may be required for decidual expansion in pregnancy. Second, clearance of senescent decidual cells upon uNK cell activation ensures that the embryo embeds in a preponderance of mature decidual cells. In co-culture, uNK cell mediated clearance of SAβG<sup>+</sup> cells transformed the decidual cell monolayer into a honeycomb pattern. If recapitulated in vivo, this observation suggests a role for uNK cells in creating ingresses in the tightly adherent decidual cell matrix to facilitate trophoblast invasion and anchoring of the conceptus. Compared to undifferentiated EnSCs, decidual cells are highly resistant to various stress signals, convert inactive cortisone into cortisol through the induction of 11β-hydroxysteroid dehydrogenase type 1, and protect the embryo-maternal interface from influx of T-cells by silencing genes coding for key chemokines (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Erlebacher, 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Gellersen and Brosens, 2014</xref>). Taken together, these observations suggest that senescent decidual cells trigger a dynamic tissue reaction that ultimately results in enclosure of the conceptus into an immune-privileged decidual matrix. In pregnancy, uNK cells express senescence markers and are proangiogenic rather than cytotoxic (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">Rajagopalan and Long, 2012</xref>). Whether prior exposure to senescent decidual cells contributes to this gestational phenotype of uNK cells is an intriguing but as yet untested possibility.</p><fig id="fig7" position="float"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.31274.019</object-id><label>Figure 7.</label><caption><title>Schematic summary.</title><p>We propose that rapid endometrial growth during the proliferative phase is important for implantation as it imparts replication stress in a subpopulation of EnSCs. Upon cell cycle exit at G0/G1, this subpopulation of stressed EnSCs do not differentiate into specialist decidual cells but undergo acute cellular senescence and secrete a host of inflammatory mediators (senescence associated secretory phenotype; SASP) involved in endometrial receptivity. In parallel, Il-15 secreted by differentiated decidual cells activates uNK cells, which then target and eliminate senescent cells through granule exocytosis. Systematic clearance of acutely senescent decidual cells by uNK cells not only remodels but also rejuvenates the endometrium at the time of embryo implantation.</p></caption><graphic mime-subtype="x-tiff" mimetype="image" xlink:href="elife-31274-fig7-v1"/></fig><p>Notably, p16<sup>+</sup> epithelial cells were present throughout the peri-implantation window, although relatively much more so in the luminal compared to glandular epithelium. It is conceivable that p16<sup>+</sup> luminal epithelial cells play a role in directing the embryo to preferential sites of implantation. However, the abundance of p16<sup>+</sup> cells in both epithelial compartments peaked on the transition of mid- to late-luteal phase, which in turn points towards a potential role for cellular senescence in rendering the endometrium refractory to further implantation. The mechanism driving senescence of endometrial epithelial cells may differ from that in stromal cells. For example, unlike their stromal counterparts, endometrial epithelial cells express human telomerase reverse transcriptase (hTERT) and exhibit dynamic telomerase activity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Hapangama et al., 2017</xref>). Interestingly, hTERT expression and telomerase activity fall dramatically during the mid-luteal phase in the cycle, i.e. preceding the rise in P16<sup>+</sup> epithelial cells observed in this study. Telomere lengths are also shortest during the mid-secretory phase, which points to an alternative mechanism of triggering cell cycle exit and senescence of epithelial cells.</p><p>Clinically, recurrent pregnancy loss (RPL) is a distressing disorder that often remains unexplained despite extensive investigations (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Lucas et al., 2016a</xref>). Embryonic chromosome instability accounts for a majority of sporadic failures. However, the likelihood of an underlying endometrial defect compromising the development of a euploid embryo increases with each additional failure. Nevertheless, the cumulative live birth rate following multiple miscarriages or IVF failures is high (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Lucas et al., 2016a</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib43">Smith et al., 2015</xref>), which suggests that embryo-endometrial interactions are intrinsically dynamic. Our findings point towards a new paradigm that accounts for the observation that RPL does not preclude a successful pregnancy. If the level of replicative stress during the proliferative phase is efficiently counterbalanced by uNK cell-mediated clearance of senescence decidual cells during the luteal phase, implantation competence of the endometrium is assured and, in the absence of other pathology, reproductive fitness should be maximal. If not, the frequency of aberrant cycles, and thus the likelihood of reproductive failure, is predicted to increase in line with the degree of endometrial dyshomeostasis. For example, the endometrium in RPL patients is characterized by MSC deficiency, heightened cellular senescence and a prolonged and disordered decidual inflammatory response (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Lucas et al., 2016b</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib42">Salker et al., 2012</xref>). Our model predicts that excessive decidual senescence can be counterbalanced by increased uNK cell proliferation and activation, thus tending towards homeostasis and leading to intermittent normal cycles. Importantly, the degree of endometrial MSC deficiency correlates with the number of previous miscarriages and, by extension, the likelihood of further failure (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Lucas et al., 2016b</xref>). This observation provides credence to our assertion that the chance of a successful pregnancy correlates inversely with the severity of endometrial dyshomeostasis. The corollary of an intrinsic ability to balance induction and clearance of senescent cells from cycle to cycle is that the human endometrium seems refractory to ageing and maintains its function throughout the reproductive years (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Hapangama et al., 2017</xref>).</p><p>In summary, acute senescence of a subpopulation of stromal cells upon decidualization triggers a multi-step process that transforms the cycling endometrium into a gestational tissue. Endometrial remodeling at the time of embryo implantation is controlled spatiotemporally by the level of decidual senescence and the efficacy of immune clearance.</p></sec><sec id="s4" sec-type="materials|methods"><title>Materials and methods</title><table-wrap id="keyresource" position="anchor"><label>Key resources table</label><table frame="hsides" rules="groups"><thead><tr><th>Reagent type</th><th>Designation</th><th>Source</th><th>Identifiers</th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td>antibody</td><td>p53</td><td>Dako</td><td>RRID:<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://scicrunch.org/resolver/AB_2206626">AB_2206626</ext-link></td></tr><tr><td>antibody</td><td>P16<sup>INK4a</sup>; p16</td><td>Abcam</td><td>RRID:<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://scicrunch.org/resolver/AB_10858268">AB_10858268</ext-link></td></tr><tr><td>antibody</td><td>Lamin B1; LMN1</td><td>Abcam</td><td>RRID:<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://scicrunch.org/resolver/AB_443298">AB_443298</ext-link></td></tr><tr><td>antibody</td><td>HMBG2</td><td>Abcam</td><td>RRID:<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://scicrunch.org/resolver/AB_1140885">AB_1140885</ext-link></td></tr><tr><td>antibody</td><td>macro.H2A; mH2A</td><td>Abcam</td><td>RRID:<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://scicrunch.org/resolver/AB_2716576">AB_2716576</ext-link></td></tr><tr><td>antibody</td><td>Histone H1; H.H1</td><td>Abcam</td><td>RRID:<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://scicrunch.org/resolver/AB_11000797">AB_11000797</ext-link></td></tr><tr><td valign="bottom">antibody</td><td valign="bottom">H3K9me3</td><td valign="bottom">Abcam</td><td valign="bottom">RRID:<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://scicrunch.org/resolver/AB_306848">AB_306848</ext-link></td></tr><tr><td>antibody</td><td>β-actin</td><td>Sigma-Aldrich</td><td>RRID:<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://scicrunch.org/resolver/AB_476744">AB_476744</ext-link></td></tr><tr><td>antibody</td><td>IL-15</td><td>R and D Systems</td><td>RRID:<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://scicrunch.org/resolver/AB_2124578">AB_2124578</ext-link></td></tr><tr><td>antibody</td><td>NKG2D</td><td>R and D Systems</td><td>RRID:<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://scicrunch.org/resolver/AB_2133263">AB_2133263</ext-link></td></tr><tr><td valign="bottom">antibody</td><td valign="bottom">PE-conjugated anti-CD56</td><td valign="bottom">Biolegend</td><td valign="bottom">RRID:<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://scicrunch.org/resolver/AB_2563924">AB_2563924</ext-link></td></tr></tbody></table></table-wrap><sec id="s4-1"><title>Patient recruitment and sample collection</title><p>Endometrial biopsies were obtained from patients attending the Implantation Clinic, a dedicated research clinic at University Hospitals Coventry and Warwickshire (UHCW) NHS Trust, Coventry, UK.

In transfection experiments, cells were seeded in 24-well plates at a density of 100,000 cells/well and grown for 2 days before transfection. At culture termination, cells were lysed in 120 μl SAβG lysis buffer (with protease inhibitors). For whole tissue analysis, tissue was washed free of excess blood by transfer through ice-cold PBS before lysis in 500 μl SAβG cell lysis buffer (with protease inhibitors) using a hand-held POLYTRON homogeniser (Kinematica, Lucerne, Switzerland). Tissue debris and un-lysed cells were cleared via centrifugation (10,000 × <italic>g</italic>, 2 min, 4°C), and the supernatant quantified for SAβG as described above. The assay was performed in non-treated 96-well plates, where 30 μl cell lysate was incubated with 30 μl reaction mixture [composition: 2 × reaction buffer, 5% (v:v) SAβG substrate and 0.1 nM β-mercaptoethanol] for 1 hr at 37°C in air in a non-humidified incubator. Cell lysis buffer alone was used as control. The assay was terminated by transfer of 50 μl reaction mix to black-walled, black-bottomed 96-well plates and addition of 200 μl stop solution. Fluorescence was determined on a PheraStar fluorescent plate reader (BMG Labtech, Ortenberg, Germany) at 360 nm (excitation) and 465 nm (emission). Fluorescent output was used as a direct measure of SAβG activity. Assays were normalized by consistent cell seeding (EnSCs) or total protein content (whole tissue) as determined by the Bradford method (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Bradford, 1976</xref>).</p></sec><sec id="s4-10"><title>Western blot analysis</title><p>Cells cultured and treated in 6-well plates were washed twice in PBS and lysed by addition of 200 μl ice-cold high-salt lysis buffer (50 mM Tris-HCl, pH 8.0, 500 mM NaCl, 5 mM EDTA, 1% (v:v) NP-40 and cOmplete mini protease inhibitors (Roche, Basel, Switzerland)). Lysate was harvested by scraping and incubated on ice for 10 min. Cell debris was cleared through centrifugation (10,000 × <italic>g</italic>, 2 min, 4°C) and supernatant collected.

Proteins were transferred onto 0.45 μm nitrocellulose (GE Healthcare, Amersham, UK) and blocked in 5% powdered milk (w:v) in TBS-T (50 mM Tris, 150 mM NaCl, 0.5% (v:v) Tween-20, pH 7.4) for 1 hr. Membranes were probed with antibodies targeting Lamin B1 (1:1000; ab16048, Abcam, Cambridge, UK), HMGB2 (1:500; ab67282, Abcam), tumour suppressor genes p16<sup>Ink4a</sup> (1:1500; ab108349, Abcam) and p53 (1:3000; Agilent, Santa Clara, USA: M7001), and the senescence-associated heterochromatin markers Histone H1 (1:2000; Abcam: ab125027), MacroH2A (1:5000; ab183041, Abcam) H3k9me3 (1:1000; ab8898, Abcam), FOXO1 (1:1000; 2880S, Cell Signaling Technologies, Denvers, M.A, USA) and β-actin, (1:100,000; A5441, Sigma-Aldrich). Antibodies were incubated overnight in TBS-T at 4°C. Blots were washed clear of unbound antibody in TBS-T before addition of anti-rabbit-HRP or anti-mouse-HRP conjugated secondary antibody (1:1000 in TBS-T; Agilent) for 1 hr at RT. Unbound antibody was washed in TBS-T and immune-reactive bands visualized with ECL reagent (GE Healthcare, Amersham, UK) and standard auto-radiography techniques. The density of individual bands was determined using Genetools gel analysis software (Syngene, Cambridge, U.K.) and plotted using GraphPad Prism software v6 (GraphPad Software Inc. CA, USA).</p></sec><sec id="s4-11"><title>Immunocytochemistry</title><p>Cytospin preparations from 100,000 isolated uNK cells were prepared using EZ Single Cytofunnels (ThermoFisher Scientific) and Surgipath X-tra Adhesive microslides (Leica Biosystems, Wetzlar, Germany). Cells were fixed in 10% formalin for 10 min, washed in TBS-T and probed with anti-CD56 antibody overnight at 4°C (1:250; clone 123C3, Agilent). CD56<sup>+</sup> cells were identified using the Novolink polymer detection system exactly as per manufacturer’s instructions (Leica Biosystems). Cells were also stained with H&amp;E. Primary antibody negative slides were used as controls. For immunofluorescence analysis, treated EnSCs seeded (100,000 cells per dish) in collagen-coated 35 mm glass-bottomed culture dishes (MatTek Corporation, Ashland, MA, USA) were fixed in 4% paraformaldehyde for 10 min, RT, and permeabilized in 0.5% Triton X-100 for 10 min, RT. Cells were probed with antibodies targeting H3K9me3 (1:500; Abcam), MacroH2A (1:2000; Abcam), Histone H1 (1:500; Abcam) and Lamin B1 (1:500; Abcam) overnight at 4°C followed by TBS-T washes before incubation with Alexa Fluor 488 anti-rabbit secondary antibody for 1 hr at RT (1:1000; Fisher Scientific). Cells were counterstained with DAPI (ProLong Gold Antifade Mountant with DAPI (ThermoFisher Scientific) and washed with TBS-T and imaged on an inverted confocal microscope (Axiovert 200 M) equipped with an LSM 510 META confocal scanner (Carl Zeiss, UK). Confocal images were captured with a 488 nm wavelength scanning laser and emitted light recorded through a band-pass filter (505–530 nm). Confocal settings were matched between samples to permit comparison of relative fluorescence. For quantification of p16<sup>+</sup> cells, EnSCs in 6-well plates were fixed and permeabilized as above, then probed with anti-p16<sup>INK4</sup> overnight at 4°C (1:400; Abcam) followed by TBS-T washes then Alexa Fluor 594 secondary antibodies for 1 hr at RT (1:1000; Fisher Scientific). Cells were DAPI stained and images captured on an EVOS FL Auto fluorescence microscope (Life Technologies, Paisley, UK). The number of fluorescent cells within individual p16<sup>+</sup> and DAPI images were counted using ImageJ image analysis software. p16<sup>+</sup> cells were expressed as a percentage of total (DAPI-stained) cells.</p></sec><sec id="s4-12"><title>Immunohistochemistry</title><p>Endometrial biopsies were fixed overnight in 10% neutral buffered formalin at 4°C and wax embedded in Surgipath Formula ‘R’ paraffin using the Shandon Excelsior ES Tissue processor (ThermoFisher). Tissues were sliced into 3 μM sections on a microtome and adhered to coverslips by overnight incubation at 60°C. Deparaffinization, antigen retrieval (sodium citrate buffer; 10 mM sodium citrate, 0.05% Tween-20, pH 6), antibody staining, hematoxylin counter stain and DAB colour development were fully automated in a Leica BondMax autostainer (Leica BioSystems). Tissue sections were stained for CD56 (a uNK-specific cell surface antigen) using a 1:200 dilution of concentrated CD56 antibody (NCL-L-CD56-504, Novocastra, Leica BioSystems), or p16 using a 1:5 dilution of p16<sup>Ink4a</sup> antibody (CINtec clone E6H4, Roche, Basel, Switzerland) as required. Stained slides were de-hydrated, cleared and cover-slipped in a Tissue-Tek Prisma Automated Slide Stainer, model 6134 (Sakura Flinetek Inc. CA, USA) using DPX coverslip mountant. Bright-field images were obtained on a Mirax Midi slide scanner using a 20x objective lens and opened in Panoramic Viewer v1.15.4 (3DHISTECH Ltd, Budapest, Hungary) for analysis. To avoid inconsistencies that reflect reduced uNK cell densities at greater endometrial depths, CD56 positive cells were quantified in compartments directly underlying the luminal epithelium. Here, three randomly selected areas of interest for each biopsy were identified and captured within Panoramic Viewer before analysis in ImageJ image analysis software (Rasband W.S. ImageJ, National Institutes of Health). Both luminal and glandular epithelial cells were removed manually before color deconvolution into constituent brown (CD56<sup>+</sup> staining) and blue (hematoxylin staining – stromal cells) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">Ruifrok and Johnston, 2001</xref>). The area of positive staining above a manually determined background threshold was used to quantify staining intensity. The uNK percentage from these data were calculated as CD56/stromal cells × 100 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Drury et al., 2013</xref>), and averaged from three images. For uNK: stromal cell correlations, 4 regions of interest strictly within only the stromal cell compartment were selected. To avoid bias regions were selected whilst blinded to the corresponding uNK stains. P16<sup>+</sup> cells were quantified separately in luminal epithelium, glandular epithelium and stromal compartments. Individual compartments were isolated manually and colors deconvolved into constituent brown (p16<sup>+</sup>cells) and blue (hematoxylin staining) and staining quantified as described above. To obtain confidence intervals, p16 or uNK scores at each day of the cycle were fitted into a beta distribution with the fitdistr function from the MASS package version 7.3–45 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib47">Venables and Ripley, 1997</xref>) in R version 3.2.1 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib45">Team, 2015</xref>). The resulting percentile values were smoothed with spline interpolation using the spline function of the basic stats package of R and converted into a heatmap using the Multi Experiment Viewer (MeV) version 4.9.0 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">Saeed et al., 2003</xref>).</p></sec><sec id="s4-13"><title>xCELLigence</title><p>Cell viability was assessed in real-time using an xCELLigence Real Time Cell Analysis (RTCA) DP instrument (ACEA Biosciences Inc, San Diego, CA, USA). EnSCs were seeded in E-16 xCELLigence plates at a density of 20,000 cells/well and cultured for 24 hr before overnight down-regulation in 2% DCC. Cells were decidualized with cAMP or MPA for 8 days as per standard protocols or left undifferentiated (vehicle control/day 0). On the day of assay, uNK cells were collected from suspension culture by centrifugation (1200 rpm, 5 min, RT) and re-suspended in 2% DCC and 10,000 uNK cells/wells were added to EnSCs and incubated for 30 min prior to assay to allow cells to settle. The xCELLigence was referenced to an impedance of 0, and changes measured every 15 min for 24 hr. For experiments requiring inhibitors, cells were treated with 10 μM Z-FAD-FMK, a broad-spectrum caspase inhibitor or 25 μM 3,4-Dichloroisocoumarin (3,4-DCI), a granzyme inhibitor, for 24 hr prior to assay and co-cultured with uNK cells in the continued presence of the inhibitors.</p></sec><sec id="s4-14"><title>Statistical analysis</title><p>GraphPad Prism v6 (GraphPad Software Inc.) was used for statistical analyses.

A lightly edited version of the letter sent to the authors after peer review is shown, indicating the most substantive concerns; minor comments are not usually included.</p></boxed-text><p>Thank you for submitting your article &quot;Clearance of senescent decidual cells by uterine natural killer cells in cycling human endometrium&quot; for consideration by <italic>eLife</italic>. Your article has been reviewed by three peer reviewers, and the evaluation has been overseen by a Reviewing Editor and Mark McCarthy as the Senior Editor. The following individual involved in review of your submission has agreed to reveal his identity: Gunter Wagner (Reviewer #1).</p><p>The reviewers have discussed the reviews with one another and the Reviewing Editor has drafted this decision to help you prepare a revised submission.</p><p>Summary:</p><p>In this study Brosens and collaborators present a novel hypothesis about the role of cell senescence during the implantation phase of pregnancy. The thesis is that a sub-population of endometrial stromal fibroblasts undergo cellular senescence and in the course of that produce a cocktail of inflammatory signals that leads to the inflammatory activation necessary for implantation. Later these cells get removed leading to the remodeling of the extracellular matrix encouraging implantation. This model is supported by experiments with primary endometrial cell culture and a large amount of clinical data.</p><p>Essential revisions:</p><p>1) Co localization of some of the markers such as p16 and SABG should be conducted to ensure this sole population of cells.</p><p>2) When conducting withdrawal of cAMP MPA they see an increase in the senescent markers they should address if this is maintenance of senescence of cell death due to hormonal support.</p><p>3) There are multiple seemingly independent approaches that the authors piece together in the final analysis which would be greatly improved by a schematic diagram of what they think is going on based on the data presented.</p><p>4) Importantly, the clinical data about the human subjects is incomplete. Did the samples come from women with no abnormalities and with proven fertility? Gynecologic disorders? Ovulatory disorders? Endocrine disorders? Recurrent miscarriage? Recurrent implantation failure? Unexplained infertility? How do the authors know whether their observations are unique to women with abnormal reproductive outcomes?</p></body></sub-article><sub-article article-type="reply" id="SA2"><front-stub><article-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.31274.024</article-id><title-group><article-title>Author response</article-title></title-group></front-stub><body><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Essential revisions:</p><p>1) Co localization of some of the markers such as p16 and SABG should be conducted to ensure this sole population of cells.</p></disp-quote><p>This is a very good suggestion; in fact, we did attempt co-localisation studies for p16 and SABG in primary cultures. However, these assays use different, non-compatible fixation methods, which precluded further analysis. Specifically, SABG staining requires glutaraldehyde, methanol and formaldehyde fixation, which does not permit p16 immunocytochemistry (ICC). Conversely, fixation of cells for ICC in 4% paraformaldehyde and 0.2% Triton-X precluded SABG staining. Other fixation methods were equally unsuccessful.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>2) When conducting withdrawal of cAMP MPA they see an increase in the senescent markers they should address if this is maintenance of senescence of cell death due to hormonal support.</p></disp-quote><p>We wish to point out that senescence markers do not rise but remain stable upon withdrawal of 8-br-cAMP and MPA from primary cultures decidualized for 8 days (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3H</xref>). We reported previously a modest increase in cell death (from 3.5% to 7%) in response to withdrawal of 8-br-cAMP and MPA from decidual cultures (Labied et al., 2006). The data infer that withdrawal of deciduogenic signals is insufficient to elicit significant cell death of senescent decidual cells.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>3) There are multiple seemingly independent approaches that the authors piece together in the final analysis which would be greatly improved by a schematic diagram of what they think is going on based on the data presented.</p></disp-quote><p>Thank you for this great suggestion. A schematic diagram is included in the revised manuscript (new <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7</xref>).</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>4) Importantly, the clinical data about the human subjects is incomplete. Did the samples come from women with no abnormalities and with proven fertility? Gynecologic disorders? Ovulatory disorders? Endocrine disorders? Recurrent miscarriage? Recurrent implantation failure? Unexplained infertility? How do the authors know whether their observations are unique to women with abnormal reproductive outcomes?</p></disp-quote><p>In subsection “Patient recruitment and sample collection”, we expanded on the clinical presentation of participating patients as follows: ‘The study cohort consisted of 942 women suffering recurrent miscarriage (defined as 3 or more consecutive miscarriages), 349 patients with recurrent implantation failure (define as 3 or more consecutive IVF failures), 139 women presenting with recurrent miscarriage following IVF treatment, and 681 other subjects, mostly women awaiting IVF treatment for a variety of reproductive disorders’.</p><p>We wish to point out that the aim of the centile graphs is to highlight temporal and inter-patient variation, whereas cycle-to-cycle variation is illustrated in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6s1">Figure 6—figure supplement 1</xref>. Importantly, there are no unequivocal criteria to define ‘normal’ endometrium. As outlined in the Discussion section, implantation failure and miscarriage do not preclude a future successful pregnancy. Indeed, cumulative live birth rates are high for patients suffering recurrent miscarriage or repeated IVF failure. Parous women are often considered ‘normal fertile controls’, although this assumes that a successful pregnancy has no discernible impact on subsequent endometrial responses, which is contentious. Further, a successful pregnancy does not preclude secondary recurrent miscarriage or implantation failure. Our findings do suggest that lack of decidual senescence and/or uNK hyperactivation may contribute to implantation failure whereas excessive decidual senescence and/or uNK deficiency are predicted to predispose for miscarriage. These hypotheses can only be tested rigorously in adequately powered, prospective clinicalstudies that link analysis of timed endometrial biopsies to subsequent pregnancy outcome. Such studies are planned.</p></body></sub-article></article>
