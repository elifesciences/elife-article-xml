therapeutic and diagnostic targets. While parasite effector proteins contribute to host immune evasion and anthelmintics have been shown to modulate secretory behaviors, little is known about the cellular origins of ES products or the tissue distributions of drug targets. We leveraged single-cell approaches in the human parasite <italic>Brugia malayi</italic> to generate an annotated cell expression atlas of microfilariae. We show that prominent antigens are transcriptionally derived from both secretory and non-secretory cell and tissue types, and anthelmintic targets display distinct expression patterns across neuronal, muscular, and other cell types. While the major classes of anthelmintics do not affect the viability of isolated cells at pharmacological concentrations, we observe cell-specific transcriptional shifts in response to ivermectin. Finally, we introduce a microfilariae cell culture model to enable future functional studies of parasitic nematode cells. We expect these methods to be readily adaptable to other parasitic nematode species and stages.</p></abstract><kwd-group kwd-group-type="author-keywords"><kwd>filarial nematodes</kwd><kwd>parasitic nematodes</kwd><kwd>single-cell</kwd><kwd>anthelmintics</kwd><kwd>antigens</kwd><kwd>secretion</kwd></kwd-group><kwd-group kwd-group-type="research-organism"><title>Research organism</title><kwd><italic>C. elegans</italic></kwd></kwd-group><funding-group><award-group id="fund1"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000002</institution-id><institution>National Institutes of Health</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>R01 AI151171</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Zamanian</surname><given-names>Mostafa</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund2"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution>NIH Office of Research Infrastructure Programs</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>P40 OD010440</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Zamanian</surname><given-names>Mostafa</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><funding-statement>The funders had no role in study design, data collection and interpretation, or the decision to submit the work for publication.</funding-statement></funding-group><custom-meta-group><custom-meta specific-use="meta-only"><meta-name>Author impact statement</meta-name><meta-value>A single-cell gene expression atlas in a human parasitic nematode provides new insights into the distribution of anthelmintic targets and the origins of secretory molecules with diagnostic and therapeutic potential at the host–parasite interface.</meta-value></custom-meta></custom-meta-group></article-meta></front><body><sec id="s1" sec-type="intro"><title>Introduction</title><p>Lymphatic filariasis (LF) is a chronic and debilitating neglected tropical disease caused by the filarial nematodes <italic>Wuchereria bancrofti, Brugia malayi,</italic> and <italic>Brugia timori</italic>. Infective-stage larvae are transmitted by mosquitoes to the human definitive host, where they develop and molt to adult stages that persist in the lymphatics and produce blood-circulating pre-larval stage microfilariae (mf) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib83">Roberts et al., 2009</xref>). LF afflicts an estimated 51 million individuals in tropical and subtropical climates around the world and endangers nearly a billion individuals worldwide (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib54">Local Burden of Disease 2019 Neglected Tropical Diseases Collaborators, 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib54">Local Burden of Disease 2019 Neglected Tropical Diseases Collaborators, 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib99">World Health Organization, 2018</xref>). Chronic cases of LF manifest in elephantiasis, an extreme buildup of lymph resulting in stigmatizing disfiguration and additional socioeconomic challenges (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib90">Ton et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib95">Weiss, 2008</xref>). Mass drug administration (MDA) in endemic settings with combinations of ivermectin (IVM), diethylcarbamazine (DEC), and albendazole (ABZ) is used to disrupt parasite transmission, but this approach is only effective with years of repeated treatment. Additionally, contraindications for antifilarial drugs exist in regions co-endemic for other filarial parasites (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Chippaux et al., 1996</xref>). With no cure and the growing threat of resistance to anthelmintics (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Campbell, 1982</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Geary et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Geary et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">Ismail et al., 1999</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib72">Osei-Atweneboana et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib98">Wolstenholme et al., 2015</xref>), there is a clear need to improve our understanding of basic biological processes that underpin the host–parasite interaction.</p><p>The excretory-secretory (ES) products of parasitic nematodes are known to be essential for parasite survival within the host (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Harnett, 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">Hotterbeekx et al., 2021</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib51">Lightowlers and Rickard, 1988</xref>). Despite the general understanding that the ES system is a conduit for the release of immunomodulatory proteins and extracellular vesicles that promote parasite survival, the biology of the ES system has yet to be investigated in medically important parasitic nematodes. Profiling of secretions (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Bennuru et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Harischandra et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Hewitson et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib43">Kaushal et al., 1982</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib62">Moreno and Geary, 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib105">Zamanian et al., 2015</xref>) across the filarial nematode life cycle has helped identify antigens that have been pursued therapeutically and diagnostically (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Harnett, 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib40">Kalyanasundaram et al., 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib56">Maizels et al., 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib65">Morris et al., 2013</xref>), but the origins of these proteins and the tissue systems that underlie their release at the host–parasite interface are unknown. Recent studies have also implicated secretory processes as a target of existing anthelmintics (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib64">Moreno et al., 2021</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib63">Moreno et al., 2010</xref>). IVM causes rapid clearance of mf from host blood at concentrations that do not cause overt fitness effects on cultured parasites. This disconnect is reconciled by a model whereby IVM unmasks mf from the host immune system by inhibiting protein and vesicle secretion (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib77">Rao et al., 1987</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib93">Vatta et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib104">Zahner et al., 1997</xref>). While the ES apparatus is thought to be the primary source of immunogenic proteins in the mf stage, the cells that comprise this structure and control secretion have not been characterized.</p><p>Clear morphological descriptions of the filarial ES system are currently restricted to the mf stage, but microscopy studies confirm that this structure is present in L3 and adult parasites (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Airs et al., 2022</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib49">Landmann et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib67">Mutafchiev et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib91">Tongu, 1974</xref>). Filarial parasites possess tubular ES systems featuring a single large excretory cell connected through a cytoplasmic bridge to an excretory vesicle and pore (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib91">Tongu, 1974</xref>). In the free-living model nematode <italic>Caenorhabditis elegans</italic>, the ES system is a well-studied and critical osmoregulatory and excretory organ made up of a pore cell, duct cell, excretory/canal cell, and canal-associated neurons (CAN) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib86">Sundaram and Buechner, 2016</xref>). However, significant diversification of ES anatomy and function between <italic>C. elegans</italic> and filariae and more generally across nematode clades (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">A. F. Bird, 1991</xref>) demands more species-specific approaches to the study of ES systems.</p><p>Single-cell transcriptomics has facilitated resolution of cellular processes and functions that are masked in tissue level or bulk transcriptomic approaches. Single-cell suspensions generated from tissue dispersions of free-living nematodes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib106">Zhang et al., 2011</xref>) have enabled high-dimensional transcriptomic analysis of cell types across developmental stages (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Ben-David et al., 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Cao et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib73">Packer et al., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib88">Taylor et al., 2021</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib106">Zhang et al., 2011</xref>) and provide a pathway to the characterization of essential cells and tissues in related parasites, including those that control secretory behaviors. However, viable cell suspensions have yet to be leveraged to transcriptomically profile human, animal, or plant parasitic nematodes at single-cell resolution. This goal is complicated in many species by life cycle patterns that can limit tissue availability and anatomical variation that can affect access to rare cell types.</p><p>Here, we applied single-cell approaches to generate and annotate a cell atlas of gene expression in <italic>B. malayi</italic> microfilariae and to map secretory-associated cell types and the distributions of prominent antigens and anthelmintic targets. We evaluated the effects of anthelmintics on parasite cells and the amenability of mf cell suspensions to longer-term culture. These data and methods allowed for novel inferences about the origins of immunogenic molecules, the mechanism of action of existing anthelmintics, and provide an avenue for future functional studies of <italic>B. malayi</italic> cell populations. We expect that many of these tools can be extended to other medically important parasitic nematodes.</p></sec><sec id="s2" sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><sec id="s2-1"><title>Generation of viable single-cell suspensions from <italic>B. malayi</italic> microfilariae</title><p>We focused our efforts on generating single-cell suspensions from the blood-circulating mf stage of the human parasitic nematode <italic>B. malayi</italic>. This pre-larval life stage is small (~177–230 µm in length, ~5–7 µm in diameter) but can be isolated from peritoneal fluid of infected jirds in large quantities (millions), potentially facilitating insight into early parasite development and the capture of rare cell types. Using larval tissue dispersion protocols from <italic>C. elegans</italic> as a scaffold, we developed a single-cell dissociation protocol in <italic>B. malayi</italic> mf that accounts for the unique biology of this parasite stage (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1A</xref>). Microfilariae suspensions recovered from the jird peritoneal cavity are developmentally asynchronous and include an abundance of host cells, tissue debris, embryos, and nonviable mf, all of which contribute to transcriptomic contamination. To reduce contamination and enrich for viable mf, peritoneal lavages were filtered using Sephadex PD-10 desalting columns (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Galal et al., 1989</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib79">Rathaur et al., 1987</xref>).

The recommended tabletop automated cell counting system Countess II (Thermo Fisher, Waltham, MA) was unreliable in confirming total and viable cell counts, likely due to cell sizes below the lower threshold of the instrument and because the cells are in multiple focal planes within the chip. Fluorescent-activated cell sorting (FACS) was also used to estimate cell count and attempt enrichment of viable cells prior to loading the 10x Genomics. The majority of cells did not survive the FACS process and could not be recovered for input into the 10x Genomics Chromium controller.

Chitinase treatment did not cause complete exsheathment, but produced a visible shrinking effect in the tail and head spaces indicating sheath breach (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1C</xref>). SDS-DTT treatment was optimized to weaken protective structures (sheath and cuticle) of chitinase-treated worms while preserving cell health. Incubation in diluted SDS-DTT effectively compromised cuticular structure and inhibited motility without causing parasite death (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1</xref>). Recoverable inhibition of motility, as revealed by subsequent wash steps, served as visual confirmation of the efficient weakening of the cuticle and preservation of the underlying body.</p><p>The generation of single-cell suspensions was completed using pronase enzymatic digestion and mechanical disruption by continuous pipetting. Progression of the pronase digestion was monitored throughout the treatment (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1D</xref>). mf cuticles were visibly compromised after approximately 20 min of digestion, where the midsection of the filarial body plan exhibits protrusions that break and release cells. Progression of the reaction yields a mixed suspension of worm segments, single cells, and intact mf, and an abundance of single cells can be seen by 30 min. Continuous mechanical disruption was essential to encourage the breakage of worms and release of single cells. The majority of undigested worms were removed by centrifugation and filtration, resulting in a highly viable single-cell mf suspension for downstream applications.</p></sec><sec id="s2-2"><title>High-content imaging of cell suspensions confirms capture of rare parasite cell types</title><p>The integrity of cells retrieved from <italic>Brugia</italic> mf dispersions was assessed by imaging flow cytometry. A total of 20,000 objects were assessed and 15,683 were identified as debris, undigested worm segments, or nonviable cells as indicated by negative Calcein-AM staining, a cell-permeable viability dye that remains within healthy cells after acetoxymethyl (AM) cleavage by non-specific esterase activity. The remaining 4317 objects were analyzed using post-acquisition image features to identify 2893 objects as live, single cells that displayed round cellular and nuclear morphology (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1E</xref>). While the majority of recovered cells have a diameter of 5.23 ± 0.77 µm, each mf is known to possess a large and morphologically distinct secretory cell that is critical to parasite survival and immune evasion in the host (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib91">Tongu, 1974</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Hewitson et al., 2008</xref>). The <italic>Brugia</italic> secretory cell is hypothesized to be responsible for the release of prominent antigens, extracellular vesicles, and nucleic acids that operate at the host-parasite interface. Classical descriptions of the mf ES system highlight the secretory cell as a large cell with bipolar canal extensions (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib63">Moreno et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib69">Nelson and Riddle, 1984</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib86">Sundaram and Buechner, 2016</xref>). We mined cells in our dataset that match this description and identified a total of 11 cells with bipolar appendages that are notably the largest identifiable cells (8.46 ± 0.77 µm in diameter) in this life stage (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1E</xref>). Each mf possesses a single secretory cell among hundreds of total cells, and this recovery rate (0.4%) falls within the expected range, providing us confidence that our dispersion protocol captures both common and rare cell types.</p></sec><sec id="s2-3"><title>Single-cell transcriptomic atlas identifies conserved and unique pre-larval cell populations</title><p>To define the transcriptional profiles of <italic>B. malayi</italic> microfilariae cell types, we generated a single-cell RNA-seq (scRNA-seq) library from cell suspensions. Dimensional reduction of 46,621 filtered cells via Uniform Manifold Approximation and Projection (UMAP) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib58">McInnes et al., 2018</xref>) identified 27 transcriptionally distinct clusters. Across all cells in the dataset, a median of 230 genes and 267 reads per cell were achieved (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s1">Figure 2—figure supplement 1</xref>). Transcript abundance of single cells strongly correlated with microfilariae bulk gene expression (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib81">Reaves et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2A</xref>, inset, <italic>r</italic> = 0.85, R<sup>2</sup> = 0.72, p=2.2 × 10<sup>–16</sup>), providing additional evidence that our single-cell pipeline largely recapitulates the cell-type distribution and transcriptional profile of the intact parasite. An analysis of <italic>B. malayi</italic> transcription factors shows both specific and broad-based transcription factor activity that aligns with known <italic>C. elegans</italic> patterns (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s2">Figure 2—figure supplement 2</xref>).

These analyses provide confidence in the biological signal acquired through scRNA-seq. Markers for well-characterized <italic>C. elegans</italic> cell types (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s3">Figure 2—figure supplement 3</xref>) with one-to-one <italic>B. malayi</italic> orthologs were used to annotate 16 UMAP clusters (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2A</xref>), and pseudobulk analysis confirms the robustness of these markers for differentiating cell types (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s4">Figure 2—figure supplement 4</xref>).

Ion channels and structural proteins in the neuromuscular system are the primary targets of nearly all anthelmintics. To identify the distribution of the known and putative targets of existing and emerging anthelmintics within the microfilarial body, we mapped the cell-type locations of β-tubulins, cys-loop ligand gated ion channels (LGICs), and additional ionotropic receptors (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5A</xref>). Benzimidazoles compromise nematode cell structural integrity by acting as microtubule inhibitors, but the specific β-tubulin target(s) are unknown in filariae despite the use of ABZ in MDA programs.

Despite this, our superficial knowledge of the structure and function of the secretory apparatus of human parasitic nematodes has limited our understanding of the molecular events that drive host–parasite interactions. To help address these knowledge gaps, we introduce the first single-cell transcriptomic atlas of a parasitic nematode and leverage this resource to resolve tissue and cell-specific gene expression patterns that allow for inferences about the origins of secretory products and antiparasitic mechanisms of action.</p><p>We developed a single-cell dissociation and RNA-seq protocol to generate a transcriptomic atlas of the blood-circulating microfilariae stage of the human filarial parasite <italic>B. malayi</italic>. Using marker genes specific for terminal and developing cell types, we annotated ~30% of the cells represented in our dataset as muscle and neuronally derived. Ten clusters in the dataset (61.5% of total cell count) remain unannotated. The use of a pre-larval developmental stage containing cells that have yet to terminally differentiate and a developmentally asynchronous mf population likely contributed to difficulties in comprehensive disentanglement and annotation of transcriptionally distinct cell clusters. The potential to annotate cells is further confounded by the unknown biological functions of genes that distinguish different clusters. These limitations can be observed in cluster 1, which represents nearly 27% of cells in the UMAP, and does not provide a distinct gene expression pattern indicative of a particular cell type. While it is possible this cluster is representative of unfiltered, low-quality cells comprised of ambient RNA, it is also plausible these cells represent low-expressing cells on a developmental trajectory or in a suspended state of development until the mf is transmitted to the mosquito host. Many unannotated clusters in the dataset may be resolved by deeper single-cell profiling and validation efforts. For instance, cluster 7 lowly expresses several <italic>C. elegans</italic> genes found in sensory neurons related to cilium assembly and organization (<italic>osm-1, dyf-11, ccep-290, ift-74, dyf-17, che-3, T12B3.1</italic>) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">Inglis et al., 2006</xref>) but lowly expresses only a subset of pan-neuronal markers (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s3">Figure 2—figure supplement 3</xref>).</p><p>Knowledge from <italic>C. elegans</italic> was useful in identifying rare cell populations such as coelomocytes or canal-associated cells, but alternative approaches were necessary for the identification of clade-diverged secretory cells. Pooled RNA-seq of sorted cell populations enriched for the morphological characteristics of the <italic>B. malayi</italic> secretory cell allowed for the annotation of secretory-like cells within the mf cell atlas. Surprisingly, prominent secreted proteins and antigens show different patterns of transcript distribution across cell populations, establishing that immunomodulatory ES products originate from different parasite tissues. For example, the diagnostic marker <italic>BmR1</italic> (<italic>Bm10631</italic>) is exclusively transcribed in the secretory cell while the vaccine immunogens <italic>Bma-val-1</italic> and <italic>Bm97</italic> are restricted to the inner body. It is possible that many of the proteins encoded by these transcripts share a common exit route from the worm through the ES apparatus (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib63">Moreno et al., 2010</xref>) or that many of these proteins are exposed to the host by dead or dying parasites. The latter possibility may warrant greater focus on targets that are actively transcribed in the secretory cell of viable parasites.</p><p>The inner body is a chitinase-enriched (<italic>Bma-cht-1.1, Bma-cht-1.2</italic>) intestinal tract precursor, and its breakdown leads to the release of chitinase and exsheathment within the mosquito (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib100">Wu et al., 2008</xref>). Exposure of mf to IVM prevents later exsheathment in the mosquito (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib78">Rao et al., 1992</xref>), which we speculate is consistent with suppression of ES function leading to the trapping of inner-body enzymes. This view of the mf ES apparatus as a secretory choke point in the parasite life cycle offers a control target relevant to both the arthropod and mammalian hosts. Later developmental stages in the parasite life cycle (L3 and adults) present additional orifices and interfaces for host interaction, necessitating other approaches to parse out the relationship between ES products and the ES apparatus in these stages.</p><p>The putative targets for mainstay anthelmintics are known, but their tissue distributions throughout the filarial worm body are unresolved. Further, the native subunit compositions of the ion channel drug targets of the macrocyclic lactones and nicotinic agonists are unknown. We leveraged these data to map the expression of known and putative antifilarial drug targets across cell types and to predict ion channel subunit associations from single-cell coexpression analysis. These predictions can guide the reconstitution and functional expression of pharmacologically relevant ion channels in heterologous studies of channel function and anthelmintic responses. We directly assessed the effects of anthelmintics on the viability of isolated cells, showing that the major anthelmintic classes do not elicit cell death at pharmacologically relevant concentrations. This suggests that the primary action of these drugs requires cell–cell connectivity. The action of IVM in <italic>C. elegans</italic> is innexin-dependent (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Dent et al., 2000</xref>), underscoring the importance of gap junctions in the signaling cascade that results in the whole-organism drug effect. To capture early transcriptional events that drive IVM action in the mf stage, we identified core genes that are upregulated across isolated cell types in response to acute drug exposure. Future studies that compare the transcriptional trajectories of cells exposed to drug before and after dissociation may help resolve the role of cell–cell communication and various compensatory responses in anthelmintic mechanisms of action.</p><p>Finally, we developed a protocol for culturing cells derived from <italic>B. malayi</italic> microfilariae tissue dispersions.

Mf were resuspended, and the entirety of the suspension was transferred to the equilibrated PD-10 column. RPMI-1640 medium was added to the column in 5 mL increments, and the flowthrough was checked every 5 mL for the presence of mf and host peritoneal cells. Mf were collected when no host peritoneal cells were present in the flowthrough and until mf were no longer being eluted. Recovered mf were washed twice in RPMI-1640 by centrifugation, resuspended in RPMI-1640, and allowed to recover at 37°C for at least 1 hr prior to beginning a single-cell dissociation.</p></sec><sec id="s4-4"><title>Microfilariae single-cell dissociation</title><p>PD-10 column purified mf from the same jird parasite infection cohort were used as input for <italic>Brugia</italic> dispersions at ~1 million mf per reaction.

The supernatant was removed, and the pellet was resuspended in 1 mL fresh L-15 medium. The mf were washed a total of five times or until the smell of SDS-DTT was no longer lingering. The pellet was resuspended in 100 µL pronase from <italic>S. griseus</italic> (VWR, Radnor, PA) at a concentration of 15 mg/mL in L-15 medium (340 mOsm). The reaction was continuously pipetted 100 times every 5 min either manually or by the use of the Repetitive Pipettor robot. The reaction was monitored by eye by checking small aliquots throughout the digestion. The reaction was stopped with ice-cold 1 mL L-15 + 10% FBS when most mf were broken open and single cells were clearly visible in the background (~30 min). The dispersed cells and remaining worms and debris was pelleted by centrifugation at 1000 rcf for 6 min at 4°C. The pellet was resuspended in 1 mL cold L-15 + 10% FBS and centrifuged briefly for 5 s at 1000 rcf to separate remaining large debris and single-cells. The top ~900 µL of cell suspension was drawn up into a 1 mL syringe and pushed through a reusable syringe filter (Millipore, Burlington, MA) containing 7 µm mesh (Component Supply, Sparta, TN). The filtrates were combined and used in downstream applications. A standard hemocytometer was the most cost- and time-effective cell count estimation method with the caveat that differentiating cell versus debris was very difficult.

Drugs were suspended in DMSO (Santa Cruz Biotechnology, Dallas, TX) and added to cell suspensions at 50 nM, 1 µM, 50 µM, and 100 µM for 20 min on ice with a final DMSO concentration of 0.1%. At the completion of incubation, the cell suspensions were centrifuged at 1000 rcf for 6 min and as much supernatant as possible was removed without disrupting the pellet. Cells were resuspended in 300 µL of L-15 + 10% FBS containing DRAQ5 (2.5 µM) and Calcein Violet-AM (0.75 µM) and stored on ice until flow cytometry analysis. Treatment controls included untreated and DMSO only (0.1%) treated cell suspensions. Controls for spectral flow cytometry included L-15 + 10% FBS, unstained cells, and DRAQ5 (2.5 µM) and Calcein Violet-AM (0.75 µM) fluorescence minus one controls. Additional controls of L-15 + 100 µM IVM and unstained cells + 100 µM IVM were necessary to confirm the presence of IVM precipitation at high concentrations picked up by the spectral flow cytometer. Viability curves of single-cell suspensions over time were generated using cells from a <italic>B. malayi</italic> mf dissociation reaction (input of ~1 million mf) and split to create three treatment groups (untreated, 0.1% DMSO, and methanol fixed) with four samples each to cover four timepoints over 8 hr. Samples were stained with DRAQ5 and Calcein Violet-AM 30 min prior to analysis on the flow cytometer. Methanol fixed cell suspensions served as a cell death control and were prepared by adding 300 µL methanol (chilled to –20°C) to 100 µL cell suspension and incubated at 4°C for 30 min prior to staining and analysis. Samples were analyzed on a Cytek Aurora Spectral Cytometer equipped with five lasers (355 nm UV, 405 nm violet, 488 nm blue, 561 nm yellow-green, and 640 nm red). The laser light channels include a forward scatter and side scatter off of both the blue and violet lasers and has 64 fluorescence channel detectors. Selection of single-cell entities was completed using FSC-A vs. FSC-H followed by selection of cells that are DRAQ5(+) and Calcein Violet-AM(+). Gated cells with a Calcein Violet-AM intensity greater than 105 were considered Calcein Violet-AM(+) and viable. Percent viability was calculated by dividing the Calcein Violet-AM(+) population by the total DRAQ5(+) population, and the EC<sub>50</sub> was calculated using the R statistical software with the drc package (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib82">Ritz et al., 2015</xref>).</p></sec><sec id="s4-7"><title>10x Genomics preparation and sequencing</title><p>A <italic>B. malayi</italic> mf single-cell suspension was split into two equal parts and one part was treated with 1 µM IVM in DMSO (1.0% final v/v) for 20 min on ice. At the end of incubation, the cells were centrifuged at 1000 rcf for 6 min at 4°C, the supernatant was removed, and the cells were resuspended in L-15 + 10% FBS. Cells were normalized to 1400 cells/µL as estimated by standard hemocytometer (INCYTO, Cheonan-si, South Korea) to target an input of 12,000 cells for capture on the 10x Genomics Chromium controller. A single technical and biological replicate was completed for each treatment. The 10x Genomics 3′ Single Cell RNA-seq protocol (v3.1 NextGEM User Guide Rev.D) was followed to generate the gel bead-in-emulsions (GEMs) and post cDNA amplification cleanup. The cDNA library was prepared using the Chromium Dual Index TT primers and the Single Cell 3′ v3.1 Reagents and user guide. The library was sequenced on an Illumina NovaSeq6000 to generate ~550M reads across control and drug-treated samples (2 × 50 bp on S1 flow cell).</p></sec><sec id="s4-8"><title>scRNA-seq mapping</title><p>The ivermectin-treated and untreated <italic>B. malayi</italic> mf scRNA-seq data were mapped and processed independently. Single-cell RNA-seq data were mapped to the <italic>B. malayi</italic> reference genome (Wormbase, WS285) using 10x Genomics Cell Ranger 5.0.1 analysis pipeline. The 10x Genomics 3′ Single Cell RNA-seq protocol is strongly biased toward the 3′ regions of mRNA that are not well annotated in <italic>B. malayi,</italic> thus requiring a modified reference genome to improve the mapping rates of the scRNA-seq data. The 3′ UTRs were artificially extended by 50, 100, 150, 200, 250, 300, 400, and 500 bp as previously described with modifications (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib88">Taylor et al., 2021</xref>). Briefly, the scRNA-seq data was mapped using the Cell Ranger pipeline for each iteration, and the total reads for each gene in every iteration were summarized across all of the cells. The gene counts for each extension were normalized to the gene count of the 500 bp extension, and the optimal extension length for each gene was determined by identifying the extension that provided at least a 90% increase in mapping rate. The <italic>B. malayi</italic> scRNA-seq raw data was mapped one final time using the newly generated reference genome containing the optimal 3′ UTR extension length for each gene. The Cell Ranger filtered output drastically underreported the estimated cell count and is not optimized for small, low-expressing cells. Therefore, the raw Cell Ranger output was used for filtration and preprocessing.</p></sec><sec id="s4-9"><title>scRNA-seq bioinformatics analysis</title><p>The raw Cell Ranger barcode matrix output for each scRNA-seq dataset (untreated and +IVM treated) was filtered to remove empty droplets using the cluster-based R package scCB2 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib71">Ni et al., 2020</xref>). Using EmptyDrops (ED) as a scaffold, scCB2 increases the power to distinguish real cells from background empty droplets as well as low-expressing, small cells by pooling low-count barcodes with similar gene expression patterns. The cluster is then compared against the estimated background population to identify irrelevant barcodes. This method of empty droplet filtration allows for the identification of small, low-expressing cells that are prevalent in the <italic>B. malayi</italic> mf single-cell dispersions. To facilitate this testing, scCB2’s CB2FindCell() function was used and droplets with 100 or fewer total counts were used to estimate the background distribution (lower = 100). A false discovery rate (FDR) was set to 0.01. The resulting cell matrix was converted to a Seurat object, and genes detected in less than three cells were omitted. The filtered cell population was then used as input into the R package SoupX (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib102">Young and Behjati, 2020</xref>) to estimate the contribution of cell-free mRNA contamination captured in each droplet. Because SoupX can provide a better estimate of contamination when cluster information is supplied, the scCB2-filtered datasets were taken through the Seurat pipeline (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Hao et al., 2021</xref>) to identify clusters. Briefly, each dataset was log normalized and variable features were selected using the ‘vst’ method and 2000 features. Principal component analysis (PCA) was completed using 50 dimensions, which were used for clustering and dimension reduction via UMAP. The raw and clustered datasets were used as input to SoupX with cells containing 0–25 total UMI counts used to estimate the ‘soup.’ A lower UMI count to estimate the ‘soup’ was used to avoid unintentionally including lower expressing neuronal cells. The estimated contamination fraction for the untreated and treated datasets were calculated to be approximately 0.13 and 0.10, respectively, and the count matrix was adjusted accordingly using the adjustCounts() function. The ambient mRNA contamination was removed and additional filters were applied on the remaining cell population. Cells with high mitochondrial representation (≥10% of all UMIs per cell) were identified using the mitochondrial markers <italic>Bm5157, Bma-nduo-4,</italic> and <italic>Bma-ctc-1</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib76">Qing et al., 2021</xref>). Cells were removed from the population if a single gene represented ≥15% of the total cell transcripts, had &gt;2500 total genes expressed, and &gt;1800 total UMIs. These cutoffs were determined by the distributions and to omit potential doublets. The remaining count matrices for the untreated and treated datasets contained &gt;10,000 genes with 21,131 and 25,490 cells, respectively. Seurat 4.1.1 was used for downstream integration and normalization. First, each matrix was log normalized and the top 2000 variable genes were identified using the FindVariableFeatures() functions using the ‘vst’ selection method. Variable genes were then used to integrate the control and treated datasets using the FindIntegrationAnchors() and IntegrateData() functions with default parameters. PCA (dims = 50) for dimension reduction was completed for clustering and visualization of the combined datasets. Differentially expressed genes between clusters were completed using the FindConservedMarkers() function in Seurat, which uses a Wilcoxon rank-sum test and Bonferroni p-value correction to account for false positives. Genes with an adjusted p-value&gt;0.05 were considered significant. Differentially expressed genes in response to IVM treatment were identified using Seurat’s FindMarkers() function with a logfc.threshold=0.25.

Your article has been reviewed by 3 peer reviewers, one of whom is a member of our Board of Reviewing Editors, and the evaluation has been overseen by Piali Sengupta as the Senior Editor. The following individual involved in review of your submission has agreed to reveal their identity: Michael Povelones (Reviewer #2).</p><p>The reviewers have discussed their reviews with one another, and the Reviewing Editor has drafted this to help you prepare a revised submission.</p><p>Essential revisions:</p><p>1) The authors use single-cell transcriptomics without FACS, which is problematic. The main issue is that single-cell transcriptomic methods are so powerful that even without FACS meaningful biological cell type identities emerge. However, the authors go further to claim that secreted products come from a variety of cell types, and this is something that could come from the lack of FACS and a general background signal. The authors will need to validate the quality of their dataset despite the lack of FACS or provide alternative sources of information, be it a new dataset or other validation experiments. Alternatively, they need to tone down the claims about broad unspecific expression and critically discuss the caveats above. The authors will need to make a better effort in explaining the quality (or lack thereof) of their dataset, for the readers to be able to interpret the data.</p><p>2) If the authors are able to address the concerns about the quality of the dataset or generate new (e.g., FACS sorted) data, they should elaborate on the interpretation of their single cell data explore the new resource in more detail. For example, a more detailed bioinformatics analysis of the secretory products would provide added value to the paper. However, any further interpretations made from their raw data, without assessing or readdressing the quality of the dataset, are not recommended due to concerns regarding the quality of the data.</p><p><italic>Reviewer #1 (Recommendations for the authors):</italic></p><p>&quot;neuromuscular and other cell types&quot; – there are no neuromuscular cell types (only neuromuscular system), would be better to write neuronal and muscular cell types</p><p>The authors &quot;mined the literature for a comprehensive list of major antigens, vaccine targets, diagnostic markers, and other notable secreted proteins&quot;</p><p>It would be useful to provide this list with the references as a source data file</p><p>The authors give an EC50 value of 51 μM for IVM treatment. Given the relatively low number of concentrations tested and replicates, this seems too precise. Either they should also provide the error of the estimate, or only say that at 50 μM approximately half of the cells died.</p><p>Figure 1—figure supplement 2 – check figure, split across two pages, text should go into figure legend</p><p>What is the difference between Figure 4A and Figure 4 —figure supplement 1? &quot;Transcript abundance of anthelmintic targets across cell clusters&quot; it seems to be the same data plotted differently. This should be clearly explained (proportion vs total reads).</p><p>In general, the figure legends for the figure supplements and source data are minimal. These should be expanded to provide more explanation.</p><p><italic>Reviewer #2 (Recommendations for the authors):</italic></p><p>Given the lack of cell lines for detailed functional studies, the ability to culture dissociated cells is exciting. The authors studied the viability in culture of the dissociated cells. Do any of the dissociated cells divide? This can be an important prerequisite for some transformation protocols. Have attempts to transfected them been made? They have been cultured on surface treated with a lectin and standard culture surfaces. Were differences seen between those? Are the secretory cells present in the culture and maintain viability to 42 h? What happens beyond 42 h?</p><p>The fact that immunogenic proteins have a broad cell distribution in the mf is interesting and as noted, raises important questions about how these proteins are exposed to the host. A greater discussion of the immunogenic proteins is warranted. For example, could some immunogenic proteins be exposed to the host by dead or dying worms? Is there an argument to be made for focusing more exclusively on those proteins that are actively transcribed by the secretory cell. Perhaps not, but expanding on this topic would be helpful.</p><p>Despite the impressive effort in generating the data, they are mostly descriptive. Given the novelty and potential value of these data and methods to the community, this is ok, but clearer discussion on the potential for functional studies is needed. In its current form, the functional potential is too vague and in places reads more like an end, rather than a beginning. For example, one of the more exciting findings is the ability to capture the single secretory cell based on size and physical properties. A potential application could be to sequence transcripts this cell to a greater depth or perform proteomics on these cells to provide a more comprehensive repertoire of its secreted products. Or to follow it developmentally? Or to culture it?</p><p>This representation is used in several figures and it is sometimes unclear what is important. Consider adding boxes or some other way to highlight important trends in the dot plots. Also, for each dot plot, please make sure there are column label abbreviation keys in the figure legend.</p><p>In panel 1A, should there be mf in the illustration of the filtration column? The legend for panel 1B indicates that this is the pre and post PD10 filtration. In this case, it is clear there are fewer particles. What are these particles? There is no scale on this. Presumably there should be mf present and they would remain at the same concentration, but they are not visible? Panel 1C needs scale indicated as well even though the mf are clear.</p><p>Panel 2B is largely redundant with 2A. As stated above, I think text and number labels with circles around clusters would improve the clarity of 2A and make 2B unnecessary.</p><p>Legend for Figure 3F should include a legend for the column labels</p><p>Panel 3G could be streamlined. I would consider a more compact simpler representation of the data, in line with how it is discussed in the paper. The larger format as it stands now could be moved into the supplement. The number or specific members of the C2H2 Zn finger family members is not discussed in the text.</p><p>In Panel 5A, are only cells &gt;10^5 in the violet channel considered viable? Either indicate in the text and/or on the graph what the cutoff is since the methanol fixed cells have signal just below 10^5 overlapping where there is a second lower peak in the untreated and DMSO groups.</p><p>I did not see an explicit data availability statement. Where and when will the data be made available to the community?</p><p><italic>Reviewer #3 (Recommendations for the authors):</italic></p><p>The main concern is the quality of the single cell dataset. In particular, how well the method developed by the authors handles cellular debris that is generated in virtually all dissociation protocols. In fact, the authors explain in their methods that they &quot;centrifuged briefly for 5 sec at 1,000 rcf to separate remaining large debris and single-cells&quot; (line 507) but I doubt that this suffices to remove all particles of debris. The authors could show this by presenting cell cytometry plots of the suspension before and after this brief centrifugation to evaluate what fraction (if any) of the cellular debris they are able to eliminate. Ultimately, the authors should present evidence of the quality of their cell suspensions by showing FACS plots before the 10X encapsulation, and, if there is still considerable cell debris left, use FACS to purify whole cells. Furthermore, in a live cell dissociation cells begin to die quickly. These can be removed by FACS similarly, but the authors do no this. Altogether, this puts into question the author's whole experimental pipeline. The predicted effects of a low quality cell dissociation would be to find genes expressed everywhere, which is precisely what the authors claim for ES products.</p><p>Futhermore, the authors should strengthen their analysis to show what parts of it come from real biological signal, and what parts can be explained by the dissociation process. The authors later use SoupX to quantify and remove their ambient RNA content but offer little detail on the process. The major argument to claim for specificity of their data is Figure 3G, where they offer a few markers that are indeed specific of cluster 15. However, this does not suffice to convey the point. Of course, there are some markers that are specific, this is already a given since in fact the clustering algorithm has already singled out these cells as a cluster, based on specific expression. The question is not if there is at least some specific signal, but how good is this signal. The process is not black or white, there are infinite levels of grey in between, where single cells get encapsulated with varying levels of cell debris and/or ambient RNA that provide a general background of general gene expression. It is important to evaluate how good is the cell dissociation, and how much this general background is present.</p><p>Consistent with the idea of a low quality dataset, a number of unannotated clusters are presented. Importantly this includes cluster 1, the one with more cells. The authors should investigate the identity of these clusters. Do they have specific markers? The authors should offer lists of markers for all their clusters, including the unannotated ones. The readers would like to see a gene annotation (name of protein / best blast hit) as well as a feature plot. The most likely explanation of these central cluster 1 unannotated cells is that these arise from cellular debris/ambient RNA. The other clusters (emerging from this central cluster) are then those cell barcodes that received debris/ambient RNA together with a cell. This can be evaluated by looking at the markers, to find out if there are only general markers in the central cluster or a cell type identity emerges.</p><p>Lastly, the dataset has very low UMI and gene counts per cell, again indicating a relative lack of quality of the dataset. The authors should discuss this in the context of other nematode cell atlases.</p></body></sub-article><sub-article article-type="reply" id="sa2"><front-stub><article-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.83100.sa2</article-id><title-group><article-title>Author response</article-title></title-group></front-stub><body><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Essential revisions:</p><p>1) The authors use single-cell transcriptomics without FACS, which is problematic.

We disagree that single-cell transcriptomics without FACS is problematic and that caveats associated with this approach, one that is well-established in the <italic>C. elegans</italic> literature, are not largely addressed through downstream quality control and cautious bioinformatics pipelines. We point to (1) the efforts of our group and others highlighting current difficulties and caveats associated with nematode cell FAC pre-sorting, (2) how our computational pipeline is conservative in its filtering of background signal and poor quality cells, (3) how bulk RNA-seq of a cell population mapped to a defined cell cluster, and (4) how the differential distribution of transcripts associated with secreted products is not at all consistent with a global background signal. We elaborate on several of these points below and provide additional details and analysis in other responses.</p><list list-type="order"><list-item><p>We originally intended to utilize FACS to enrich for viable cells prior to sequencing. However, we observed dramatically low levels of cell viability in the sorted cell populations. This phenomenon has also been observed and reported with <italic>C. elegans</italic> single-cell preps (Preston et al. 2019) resulting in the omission of FACS prior to 10x encapsulation for the majority of available <italic>C. elegans</italic> single-cell transcriptomic atlases. Cuticular and other debris in these <italic>C. elegans</italic> single-cell dissociations was not problematic in downstream analyses. A recent <italic>C. elegans</italic> scRNA-seq study reports successfully using FACS prior to 10x encapsulation to enrich for somatic adult cells but were only able to complete the experiments by methanol-fixing and rehydrating the cells prior to FACS and encapsulation, a method not recommended by 10x Genomics at the time our study was completed. It is also just as reasonable to believe that stressing nematode cells through additional processing steps in the way of sorting and fixation-rehydration can introduce artifactual transcriptional states.</p></list-item><list-item><p>Our tissue dissociation protocol and scRNA-seq computational analysis pipeline are comparable to published <italic>C. elegans</italic> methods and data. Modifications to these established pipelines only increase the stringency of our quality control and caution in our interpretation. We consider cells with a total UMI count between 100-1,800 UMIs despite several <italic>C. elegans</italic> studies having shown that several neurons are omitted by the standard 100 UMI lower threshold, to further limit undesired background signal. An upper threshold of 1,800 UMIs was chosen as a method to thwart doublet inclusion since the doublet rate when loading the 10X chromium chip could not be accurately estimated. Our estimates of background signal and correction using SoupX were comparable to <italic>C. elegans</italic> (4.15-13.56% with a mean of 8.01%) at 10-13%. Lastly, several <italic>C. elegans</italic> datasets omit cells with &gt;20% mitochondrial representation. We chose a conservative approach and omitted cells that had &gt;10% transcripts associated with mitochondrial genes. Together, these approaches give us confidence that the signal we are analyzing is true biological signal as opposed to background noise that arose from a poor tissue dissociation protocol.</p></list-item><list-item><p>We utilized flow cytometry to sort <italic>B. malayi</italic> microfilariae cell populations directly into TRIzol for bulk RNAseq. These populations were defined by cell size and granularity in order to capture the characteristically large secretory cell in microfilariae. The gene transcripts from this pooled cell population mapped primarily to a single cluster in our scRNA-seq atlas indicating specificity of our data.</p></list-item><list-item><p>We are able to clearly and specifically detect marker genes and transcription factors for the subset of known microfilariae cell types in our dataset with minimal or no detectable spillover into other cell types. The majority of unannotated clusters in our data also have distinguished but unannotated marker genes in the <italic>Brugia malayi</italic> genome therefore limiting our annotation capabilities. In direct reference to our conclusions about the broad and cell type specific expression patterns of secreted antigens, our analysis in <italic>B. malayi</italic> is mirrored in <italic>C. elegans</italic> orthologs providing additional support that our conclusions are based on biological signal and not ubiquitous background signal.</p></list-item></list><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>2) If the authors are able to address the concerns about the quality of the dataset or generate new (e.g., FACS sorted) data, they should elaborate on the interpretation of their single cell data explore the new resource in more detail.

We have made revisions to Figure 6 (Figure 7 in the revised version) to address your questions about cell viability and proliferation. We quantified the viability of cells in culture out to 96 hrs and although we observed a reduction in viability, a significant subset of cells remain viable at this timepoint. We have attempted transfecting these cells using electroporation and several lipofection approaches without immediate success but this is ongoing work. Unfortunately, these cells do not appear to be in a proliferative state based on an EdU proliferation assay (Figure 7—figure supplement 1), which helps explain the difficulty of successful transfection and which will necessitate optimization of other approaches. Secretory cells are present in single-cell suspensions and were captured in our imaging flow cytometry data at the earliest time points, however they are rare (1 cell/mf) and difficult to identify in culture by eye. Additional details regarding the cell culture viability and proliferation results have been added to the revised Results section.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>The fact that immunogenic proteins have a broad cell distribution in the mf is interesting and as noted, raises important questions about how these proteins are exposed to the host.

It is likely that some immunogenic proteins are exposed to the host by dead or dying worms, while other proteins encounter the host through secretory/excretory tissues and pathways, as cargo in exosome-like vesicles, or other poorly defined mechanisms. The secretory cell is the most obvious interface for regulated secretion in this particular life stage and our data shows that many immunogenic proteins are in fact expressed in this annotated cell type. In light of underdevelopment of other primary organs, we agree that maybe this is an argument for focusing on actively transcribed secretory-cell associated proteins. We have added a sentence in the discussion to this effect.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Despite the impressive effort in generating the data, they are mostly descriptive. Given the novelty and potential value of these data and methods to the community, this is ok, but clearer discussion on the potential for functional studies is needed. In its current form, the functional potential is too vague and in places reads more like an end, rather than a beginning. For example, one of the more exciting findings is the ability to capture the single secretory cell based on size and physical properties. A potential application could be to sequence transcripts this cell to a greater depth or perform proteomics on these cells to provide a more comprehensive repertoire of its secreted products. Or to follow it developmentally? Or to culture it?</p></disp-quote><p>We were able to successfully image secretory cells by imaging flow cytometry and capture the transcriptional profile using a FACS-RNA-seq approach based on cell size but there are still several barriers to isolating secretory cells in culture for further investigation. Since there is a single secretory cell per mf, enriching these cells in culture or completing transcriptomic and proteomic studies is still a challenge without the use of a transgenic marker or antibody labeling approach to isolate this cell in culture. We certainly have interests in the proteomic profiling and developmental trajectory of the secretory cell and these are active areas of investigation for our lab and hopefully the basis of future findings.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>This representation is used in several figures and it is sometimes unclear what is important. Consider adding boxes or some other way to highlight important trends in the dot plots. Also, for each dot plot, please make sure there are column label abbreviation keys in the figure legend.</p></disp-quote><p>Abbreviation keys have been added to the main and supplemental figure legends for figures that include dot plots. Text within figure legend has been added to direct attention to expression patterns of interest.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>In panel 1A, should there be mf in the illustration of the filtration column? The legend for panel 1B indicates that this is the pre and post PD10 filtration. In this case, it is clear there are fewer particles. What are these particles? There is no scale on this. Presumably there should be mf present and they would remain at the same concentration, but they are not visible? Panel 1C needs scale indicated as well even though the mf are clear.</p></disp-quote><p>Thank you for your comments. The filtration illustration in panel 1A has been modified to more clearly demonstrate the purpose of filtering the mf prior to beginning the dissociation protocol, which is to separate viable microfilariae from dead microfilariae, embryos, and jird cells and tissue in the lavage (noted in the figure legend). The pre- and post PD10 filtration images in panel 1B are binary image representations of filtrate containing cells/embryos/tissue debris strained with a CellTox viability dye. Viable microfilariae do not stain with CellTox and are therefore not observed in the images. This is a well of a 96 well plate and that is now reflected in the figure legend to provide a sense of scale. Panel 1C has been updated to include a scale bar.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Panel 2B is largely redundant with 2A. As stated above, I think text and number labels with circles around clusters would improve the clarity of 2A and make 2B unnecessary.</p></disp-quote><p>Thank you for your feedback. Figure 2 has been updated to improve the clarity of 2A, with cell cluster annotations directly plotted, and to remove the redundancy of 2B.

Additional computational analysis specifically focusing on the secretory cell has been added as an additional figure (Figure 4), which now includes a complete analysis of C2H2 Zn finger transcription factors based on <italic>C. elegans</italic> orthologs.

Where and when will the data be made available to the community?</p></disp-quote><p>A Data and Code Availability section is present in the Methods section which included a GitHub repository and NIH BioProject records to allow people to access the raw data and code used to process the data. Unfortunately the size of the processed data was too large to deposit into the GitHub repository so we have deposited the processed data objects (Seurat and AnnData) into a Zenodo repository for easy download by the community. We understand not everybody has the ability to explore this data in R or by Python packages so we have created a RStudio Shiny application to easily explore the data in various capacities. All of these improvements to data availability are reflected in the updated Data and Code Availability subsection of the Methods section.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Reviewer #3 (Recommendations for the authors):</p><p>The main concern is the quality of the single cell dataset. In particular, how well the method developed by the authors handles cellular debris that is generated in virtually all dissociation protocols. In fact, the authors explain in their methods that they &quot;centrifuged briefly for 5 sec at 1,000 rcf to separate remaining large debris and single-cells&quot; (line 507) but I doubt that this suffices to remove all particles of debris. The authors could show this by presenting cell cytometry plots of the suspension before and after this brief centrifugation to evaluate what fraction (if any) of the cellular debris they are able to eliminate. Ultimately, the authors should present evidence of the quality of their cell suspensions by showing FACS plots before the 10X encapsulation, and, if there is still considerable cell debris left, use FACS to purify whole cells. Furthermore, in a live cell dissociation cells begin to die quickly. These can be removed by FACS similarly, but the authors do no this. Altogether, this puts into question the author's whole experimental pipeline. The predicted effects of a low quality cell dissociation would be to find genes expressed everywhere, which is precisely what the authors claim for ES products.</p><p>Futhermore, the authors should strengthen their analysis to show what parts of it come from real biological signal, and what parts can be explained by the dissociation process. The authors later use SoupX to quantify and remove their ambient RNA content but offer little detail on the process. The major argument to claim for specificity of their data is Figure 3G, where they offer a few markers that are indeed specific of cluster 15. However, this does not suffice to convey the point. Of course, there are some markers that are specific, this is already a given since in fact the clustering algorithm has already singled out these cells as a cluster, based on specific expression. The question is not if there is at least some specific signal, but how good is this signal. The process is not black or white, there are infinite levels of grey in between, where single cells get encapsulated with varying levels of cell debris and/or ambient RNA that provide a general background of general gene expression. It is important to evaluate how good is the cell dissociation, and how much this general background is present.</p><p>Consistent with the idea of a low quality dataset, a number of unannotated clusters are presented. Importantly this includes cluster 1, the one with more cells. The authors should investigate the identity of these clusters. Do they have specific markers? The authors should offer lists of markers for all their clusters, including the unannotated ones. The readers would like to see a gene annotation (name of protein / best blast hit) as well as a feature plot. The most likely explanation of these central cluster 1 unannotated cells is that these arise from cellular debris/ambient RNA. The other clusters (emerging from this central cluster) are then those cell barcodes that received debris/ambient RNA together with a cell. This can be evaluated by looking at the markers, to find out if there are only general markers in the central cluster or a cell type identity emerges.</p></disp-quote><p>We understand Reviewer #3’s concern over the quality of this single-cell dataset and we certainly share their values in publishing quality and accurate data. We believe we’ve made a very strong case through multiple lines of evidence that the data presented in this paper meets or exceeds field standards for model nematode (<italic>C. elegans</italic>) datasets despite the added complication of working with a parasitic species. We have provided more detailed answers to more specific critiques below:</p><p>FACS pre-sorting: We partly addressed the comment about FACS sorting prior to 10x encapsulation earlier in this response. Reviewer #3 is correct that brief centrifugation does not remove all background debris but it does remove large debris like sheath husks and partially digested worm bodies that threaten to clog downstream instrumentation (i.e. flow cytometer, 10X Genomics microfluidic device, etc.). We trialled running cell suspensions through FACS prior to 10X encapsulation to enrich for viable cells, but realized that cells do not survive the FACS process despite using the most gentle instrument settings (see Figure_1—figure supplement 2). This obstacle has also been encountered in the published <italic>C. elegans</italic> single-cell literature, where it is noted that cells struggle to survive the sorting process and viability quickly diminishes in the few cells that do survive the process (Preston et al. 2019). Single-cell transcriptomes from <italic>C. elegans</italic> studies that omit FACS prior to 10x encapsulation are high quality and a significant number of gene expression patterns observed in the scRNA-seq data have been validated in whole-tissue <italic>C. elegans</italic> experiments. We would also argue that omitting FACS prior to encapsulation allowed us to capture the transcriptional state of <italic>B. malayi</italic> mf cells nearer to the time of tissue dissociation. We proceeded without FACS with the understanding that stringent computation filtering and analysis would be required in order to “cut through the noise”, following well-established standards in the field.</p><p>Biological signal: The major nematode cell types are represented and differentiated in our global dataset and enriched for expected genes orthologous to established tissue-specific markers in <italic>C. elegans</italic>. We are confident in our specific annotation of these more obvious cell types in the dataset. The annotation of the secretory cell, which we would not expect to be associated with pan-nematodal markers, required additional experiments. We therefore believe our annotation approach is conservative. We have provided additional details about the use of SoupX to filter ambient transcripts and background noise. Some of the critiques the reviewer has made are generically true of all single-cell datasets in non-model organisms, and these caveats are acknowledged. With more sequencing runs, we will be able to update and refine annotations as needed, which is the standard approach across organisms and tissues. This dataset represents an important starting point towards a comprehensive map.</p><p>We have further evaluated our dataset using orthogonal approaches. First, we applied a pseudobulk method for cell pattern clustering. The primary annotated cell types in our dataset clustered the same way using this alternative algorithm. Second, we analyzed the pattern of transcription factor expression across our cell clusters and we see global and cluster-specific TF expression patterns that correspond to known expression patterns in other organisms. These datasets and their associated figures are now included in the revised manuscript.</p><p>We would like to address the reviewer’s comments about the ‘surprising’ distribution of E/S products across cell types. This does necessarily surprise us. E/S products as sampled by proteomic studies of parasite culture media include mostly proteins without signal peptides and are understood to include proteins from the parasite surface and various orifices. We have mapped a similar thing using replicated spatial transcriptomics approaches in adult stage parasites (Airs et al., PLoS Pathogens 2022). In fact, <italic>C. elegans</italic> orthologs of prominent filarial antigens actually exhibit similar patterns of expression. For example, <italic>far-1</italic> and <italic>unc-15</italic> are sequestered to muscle cell types, <italic>pghm-1</italic> is expressed in neuronal cells, and <italic>mif-1</italic>, <italic>tct-1</italic>, and <italic>tpi-1</italic> are widely expressed across all cell types in both <italic>C. elegans</italic> and <italic>B. malayi</italic>. These mirrored observations in expression patterns across <italic>C. elegans</italic> and <italic>B. malayi</italic> strongly support our capture of real biological signals.</p><p>Unannotated cells: Several clusters remain unannotated in our data. Some display cluster-specific gene expression but we do not have enough information about the microfilariae cell types (or the unique biology of filariae) to confidently assign specific identities. Others likely reflect the biological reality of the microfilariae stage. Microfilariae are a post-embryonic and pre-larval development state containing a mixture of terminal and undifferentiated cell types. Microfilariae lack several prominent structures including a complete alimentary canal. These pre-larvae circulate in a suspended developmental state until they are ingested by a mosquito vector and transition to an invertebrate environment, initiating rapid growth and molting events. We therefore expected a larger mass of likely undifferentiable and potentially dormant cell types (e.g., Cluster 1) in the global map of gene expression. These clusters also have low gene and UMI counts per cell, which is in keeping with undifferentiated cells in some other species (e.g., planarian and schistosome neoblasts). For these reasons, we only assigned annotations for major cell types where clearly supported, understanding that cell-to-cell comparisons of clade III and clade V nematodes are more risky for deeper annotation. A Supplementary file containing differentially expressed genes for each cluster has been added to the manuscript, which could help with future annotations of these more ambiguous clusters.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Lastly, the dataset has very low UMI and gene counts per cell, again indicating a relative lack of quality of the dataset. The authors should discuss this in the context of other nematode cell atlases</p></disp-quote><p>Nematode cells are comparatively much smaller than mammalian cells and will therefore have lower UMI and gene counts compared to the majority of published scRNAseq studies in the literature. In the context of other nematodes, our data is within the range of expression seen in <italic>C. elegans</italic> datasets when we consider the developmental stages of the nematodes (see table below). If we omit the cells in cluster 1 with the assumption that these are undifferentiated cells and therefore low expression, our data has a mean of ~411 UMI/cell and ~319 genes/cell. Additionally, a sizeable portion of the differentiated cells at this development state are neuronal, which are reported to be very low expressing cells in <italic>C. elegans</italic> and are often accidentally omitted from analysis when using standard scRNA-seq UMI/gene expression cutoffs. Lastly, UMI and gene counts per cell are partially dependent on the depth of sequencing, which differs across studies. Our libraries were sequenced to 60-70% saturation and while it’s possible that greater depth would marginally improve these statistics, our dataset aligns with published studies and is adequate to differentiate major cell types.</p><table-wrap id="sa2table1" position="float"><label>Author response table 1.</label><table frame="hsides" rules="groups"><thead><tr><th>Paper</th><th>Stage</th><th>UMIs/cell</th><th>genes/cell</th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td align="left" valign="top">Preston et al., 2019</td><td align="left" valign="top">embryo</td><td align="left" valign="top">156</td><td align="left" valign="top">52</td></tr><tr><td align="left" valign="top">This study</td><td align="left" valign="top">mf</td><td align="left" valign="top">267 (median)</td><td align="left" valign="top">230 (median)</td></tr><tr><td align="left" valign="top">Cao et al., 2017</td><td align="left" valign="top">L2</td><td align="left" valign="top">575 (median)<break/>1,121 (mean)</td><td align="left" valign="top">431 (mean)</td></tr><tr><td align="left" valign="top">Taylor et al., 2021</td><td align="left" valign="top">L4</td><td align="left" valign="top">893 (median)</td><td align="left" valign="top">321 (median)</td></tr><tr><td align="left" valign="top">Roux et al., 2022</td><td align="left" valign="top">Adult</td><td align="left" valign="top">2,175</td><td align="left" valign="top">644</td></tr></tbody></table></table-wrap></body></sub-article></article>
