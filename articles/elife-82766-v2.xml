Most T6SSs mediate antibacterial activities, whereas the potential anti-eukaryotic role of T6SS remains understudied. Here, we found a <italic>Vibrio</italic> T6SS that delivers two novel effectors into mammalian host immune cells. We showed that these effectors induce a pyroptotic cell death in a phagocytosis-dependent manner; we identified the NLRP3 inflammasome as being the underlying mechanism leading to the T6SS-induced pyroptosis. Moreover, we identified a compensatory T6SS-induced pathway that is activated upon inhibition of the canonical pyroptosis pathway. Genetic analyses revealed possible horizontal spread of this T6SS and its anti-eukaryotic effectors into emerging pathogens in the marine environment. Our findings reveal novel T6SS effectors that activate the host inflammasome and possibly contribute to virulence and to the emergence of bacterial pathogens.</p></abstract><kwd-group kwd-group-type="author-keywords"><kwd>T6SS</kwd><kwd>secretion system</kwd><kwd>pyroptosis</kwd><kwd>cell death</kwd><kwd>gasdermin</kwd><kwd>caspase</kwd></kwd-group><kwd-group kwd-group-type="research-organism"><title>Research organism</title><kwd>Mouse</kwd><kwd>Vibrio proteolyticus</kwd></kwd-group><funding-group><award-group id="fund1"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100003977</institution-id><institution>Israel Science Foundation</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>2174/22</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Gerlic</surname><given-names>Motti</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund2"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100003977</institution-id><institution>Israel Science Foundation</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>920/17</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Salomon</surname><given-names>Dor</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund3"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution>Tel Aviv University Recanati</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Salomon</surname><given-names>Dor</given-names></name><name><surname>Gerlic</surname><given-names>Motti</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund4"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution>Clore Israel Foundation</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Fridman</surname><given-names>Chaya Mushka</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund5"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100004375</institution-id><institution>Tel Aviv University</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>Manna Center Program</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Fridman</surname><given-names>Chaya Mushka</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><funding-statement>The funders had no role in study design, data collection and interpretation, or the decision to submit the work for publication.</funding-statement></funding-group><custom-meta-group><custom-meta specific-use="meta-only"><meta-name>Author impact statement</meta-name><meta-value>A horizontally shared type VI secretion system affects the interaction between vibrios and eukaryotic hosts.</meta-value></custom-meta></custom-meta-group></article-meta></front><body><sec id="s1" sec-type="intro"><title>Introduction</title><p>Innate immune responses combat infections but may also drive pathological inflammation. The innate immune system engages an array of pattern-recognition receptors (PRR) that are expressed by cells found at the defensive front line against infections including macrophages, dendritic cells, neutrophils, and others. PRRs can detect a variety of microbial determinants termed pathogen-associated molecular patterns (PAMPs). Moreover, damaged host cells can also trigger PRRs by releasing danger-associated molecular patterns (DAMPs) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib70">Wallach et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib72">Wen et al., 2013</xref>).</p><p>Some PRRs of the innate immune system are assembled into a high-molecular weight complex called âthe inflammasomeâ after sensing DAMPs or PAMPs. Inflammasome complexes are considered central components of innate immunity because of their ability to kill an infected cell (a cell death process that is termed pyroptosis), or by their activation and the subsequent secretion of mature proinflammatory cytokines interleukin 1Î² (IL-1Î²) and IL-18 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">Lamkanfi and Dixit, 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib60">Schroder and Tschopp, 2010</xref>). Inflammasomes can be divided into: (1) a canonical pathway in which Caspase-1 is cleaved into a catalytically active enzyme, and (2) non-canonical pathways in which Caspase-11 is activated (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">Lamkanfi and Dixit, 2014</xref>). The canonical inflammasome comprises one of the nucleotide-binding oligomerization domain (NOD), leucine-rich repeat (LRR)-containing protein (NLR) family members, including NLRP1, NLRP3, NLRC4, or the DNA sensor absent in melanoma 2 (AIM2), all of which contain either a pyrin domain (PYD) or a caspase recruitment domain (CARD) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib60">Schroder and Tschopp, 2010</xref>). These domains interact with apoptosis-associated speck-like protein (ASC), leading to its polymerization into large helical filaments known as ASC specks by facilitating self-interactions of the PYD of ASC (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Franklin et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib49">Proell et al., 2013</xref>). The CARD domain of the ASC specks recruits Caspase-1 via a CARD-CARD interaction, leading to Caspase-1 clustering that permits autocleavage and formation of the active Caspase-1 p10/p20 tetramer (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">Lamkanfi and Dixit, 2014</xref>). Activated Caspase-1 processes pro-IL-1Î² and pro-IL-18 into their mature forms. Simultaneously, activated Caspase-1 cleaves gasdermin D (GSDMD) into a C-terminal fragment (GSDMD-CT) and N-terminal fragment (GSDMD-NT) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">Liu et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib63">Shi et al., 2015</xref>). GSDMD-NT oligomerizes in membranes to form pores which promote IL-1Î² release and pyroptotic cell death (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">Lieberman et al., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">Liu et al., 2016</xref>).</p><p>The type VI secretion system (T6SS) is a widespread macromolecular protein secretion apparatus that translocates proteins into neighboring cells in a contact-dependent manner (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Bingle et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Boyer et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib45">Mougous et al., 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib50">Pukatzki et al., 2006</xref>). Most of the T6SS-secreted proteins are toxic effectors capable of manipulating target cells. Although many T6SS effectors are antibacterial toxins, some T6SSs deliver effectors with anti-eukaryotic activities into host cells, thus promoting virulence or defense against predation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib44">MonjarÃ¡s Feria and Valvano, 2020</xref>). Nevertheless, the anti-eukaryotic potential of T6SSs remains understudied and possibly underappreciated (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Dar et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Hachani et al., 2016</xref>).</p><p>T6SS is common in vibrios (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Dar et al., 2018</xref>), a genus of Gram-negative marine bacteria that includes many established and emerging human pathogens (e.g. <italic>Vibrio cholerae, Vibrio parahaemolyticus,</italic> and <italic>Vibrio vulnificus</italic>), which are a leading cause of gastroenteritis and wound infections (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Baker-Austin et al., 2018</xref>).

Nevertheless, it encodes a secreted pore-forming hemolysin (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Cohen et al., 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib52">Ray et al., 2016</xref>) and three different T6SSs (T6SS1-3) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib52">Ray et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib53">Ray et al., 2017</xref>). T6SS1 mediates both antibacterial and anti-eukaryotic activities, whereas T6SS3 does not play any role in bacterial competition and its hypothesized anti-eukaryotic potential remains to be investigated (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib53">Ray et al., 2017</xref>).</p><p>In a recent study in which we investigated the secreted <italic>V. proteolyticus</italic> cytotoxic hemolysin, VPRH, we observed the existence of another, VPRH-independent cell death that occurred only during infections of primary macrophages, but not in the cultured cell lines HeLa or RAW264.7 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Cohen et al., 2020</xref>). Thus, in this study, we set out to determine whether <italic>V. proteolyticus</italic> T6SSs can lead to cell death in primary macrophages, and if so, to decipher the underlying mechanism. We found that <italic>V. proteolyticus</italic> T6SS3, but not T6SS1, induced a phagocytosis-dependent cell death in bone marrow-derived macrophages (BMDMs). Using chemical and genetics approaches, we identified pyroptosis as the underlying mechanism of T6SS3-induced cell death, and specifically the NLRP3 inflammasome. Moreover, we found that a pathway comprising gasdermin E (GSDME) and caspase-3 compensates for GSDMD absence in response to T6SS3 activity, in a NLRP3-dependent manner. Last, we identified a new T6SS3 activator and two novel T6SS3 anti-eukaryotic effectors that are needed to induce inflammasome-mediated cell death in BMDMs. Overall, our findings shed new light on the interplay between T6SS, phagocytosis and the NLRP3 inflammasome, and underscore the virulence potential of T6SSs.</p></sec><sec id="s2" sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><sec id="s2-1"><title>T6SS3 induces cell death in primary macrophages</title><p>We previously showed that <italic>V. proteolyticus</italic> induces two types of cell death in BMDMs: (1) a rapid cell death that is mediated by the pore-forming hemolysin, VPRH, and (2) a slower cell death that is VPRH-independent (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Cohen et al., 2020</xref>). The underlying mechanism driving the latter remains unknown. <italic>V. proteolyticus</italic> harbors three T6SSs (T6SS1-3). We hypothesized that one or more of these T6SSs are responsible for the observed VPRH-independent cell death. Previously, we showed that T6SS1 mediates interbacterial competition and manipulates the actin cytoskeleton in macrophages (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib53">Ray et al., 2017</xref>). We also proposed that T6SS3 targets eukaryotic cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib53">Ray et al., 2017</xref>). Furthermore, we reported that T6SS1 and T6SS3 are functional under laboratory conditions; however, we did not detect any T6SS2 activating conditions (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib53">Ray et al., 2017</xref>). Therefore, we excluded T6SS2 from subsequent analyses, and we focused on a possible contribution of T6SS1 and T6SS3 to cell death in BMDMs.</p><p>To investigate the role of T6SS1 and T6SS3 in cell death, we first sought to further induce T6SS activity. We reasoned that if a T6SS is responsible for inducing cell death, then hyper-activating it would improve our ability to monitor the cell death phenotype by (1) maximizing its amplitude, (2) shortening the time to onset, and (3) allowing us to lower the multiplicity of infection (MOI). We previously reported that H-NS, the histone-like nucleoid-structuring protein, is a negative regulator of T6SSs in vibrios and that its deletion results in hyper-activation of T6SS (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib57">Salomon et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib58">Salomon et al., 2015</xref>). Thus, we generated a <italic>V. proteolyticus</italic> strain with a deletion in a gene we named <italic>hns1</italic> (<italic>VPR01S_RS04360</italic>); it encodes an H-NS that is very similar to VP1133, the previously studied H-NS protein from <italic>V. parahaemolyticus</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib57">Salomon et al., 2014</xref>). Importantly, the deletion was performed in a Î<italic>vprh</italic> background to allow the subsequent monitoring of VPRH-independent cell death. We then determined the effect of <italic>hns1</italic> deletion on T6SS1 and T6SS3 activity. To this end, we monitored the expression and secretion of VgrG1 and Hcp3, hallmark secreted tail tube components of T6SS1 and T6SS3, respectively. We found that <italic>hns1</italic> deletion resulted in elevated secretion of both VgrG1 and Hcp3, compared to their secretion from the parental Î<italic>vprh</italic> strain (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1a</xref>). Notably, the secretion of VgrG1 and Hcp3 was T6SS1- and T6SS3-dependent, respectively, as evident from their absence in the supernatant fractions of strains deleted for <italic>tssG1</italic> (T6SS1<sup>-</sup>) and <italic>tssL3</italic> (T6SS3<sup>-</sup>), which are core structural genes required for the activity of T6SS1 and T6SS3, respectively. These results indicate that <italic>hns1</italic> deletion derepresses T6SS1 and T6SS3, leading to their constitutive activation and thus elevated secretion.</p><fig id="fig1" position="float"><label>Figure 1.</label><caption><title>T6SS3 induces cell death in primary macrophages.</title><p>(<bold>a</bold>) Expression (cells) and secretion (media) of Hcp3 and VgrG1 from the indicated <italic>V. proteolyticus</italic> strains were detected by immunoblotting using specific antibodies against Hcp3 and VgrG1, respectively.

Unlike the two cell lines, BMDMs contain a functional cell death mechanism known as pyroptosis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Cohen et al., 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib49">Proell et al., 2013</xref>). Pyroptosis is a form of necrotic and inflammatory regulated cell death induced by the inflammasome complex. Assembly of the inflammasome leads the maturation and secretion of pro-inflammatory cytokines, such as IL-1Î² (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib41">Man et al., 2017</xref>). Therefore, we hypothesized that inflammasome activation and pyroptosis are the mechanisms underlying the VPRH-independent, T6SS3-dependent cell death in BMDMs. To test this hypothesis, we monitored the effect of specific inflammasome inhibitors on T6SS3-mediated cell death. Using real-time microscopy, we observed that addition of either inhibitors, MCC950 (blocks ASC oligomerization by inhibiting the canonical and non-canonical NLRP3 inflammasome <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib62">Shao et al., 2015</xref>) or Vx765 (a potent and selective competitive inhibitor of Caspase-1 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Church et al., 2008</xref>) resulted in delayed and reduced cell death during infection with Î<italic>vprh</italic>/Î<italic>hns1</italic> bacteria (~40% reduction as measured by calculating the AUC), compared with a dimethyl sulfoxide (DMSO)-treated control (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2a and b</xref>).

In this work, we describe T6SS3, a functional T6SS in the marine bacterium <italic>V. proteolyticus</italic>, which induces inflammasome-mediated cell death (known as pyroptosis) upon phagocytosis. We show that this T6SS-mediated pyroptotic cell death is dependent on the delivery at least two novel effectors, and that it involves the activation of the NLRP3 inflammasome, leading to the processing and release of Caspase-1, IL-1Î², and GSDMD. Two other T6SS effectors were previously reported to indirectly affect inflammasome activation: EvpP from <italic>Edwardsiella tarda</italic> was shown to inhibit the NLRP3 inflammasome by targeting the MAPK-Jnk pathway (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Chen et al., 2017</xref>), whereas TecA from <italic>Burkholderia cenocepacia</italic> deamidates Rho GTPases, leading to activation of the pyrin-inflammasome (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Aubert et al., 2016</xref>). Here, we describe for the first time, to the best of our knowledge, not one but two T6SS effectors that lead to activation of the NLRP3 inflammasome.</p><p>Remarkably, we found that in the absence of GSDMD, the canonical gasdermin activated during pyroptosis, an alternative NLRP3-dependent inflammasome cell death cascade, which includes Caspase-1, Caspase-3 (but not Caspase-8) and GSDME, can be induced by this T6SS3. Since IL-1Î² release is one of the most ancient and conserved immune mechanism (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Dinarello, 2018</xref>), it is impotent to understand how the mammalian immune system evolved to induce several backup mechanisms to ensure its activation. Even in the case of GSDMD inhibition, which may occur if GSDMD is targeted by the pathogen (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">Luchetti et al., 2021</xref>), a conserved mechanism including the activation of Caspase-3 and GSDME in a NLRP3 inflammasome-dependent manner will result in the secretion of this proinflammatory cytokine. Notably, a recent study independently reported a similar compensation mechanism in the absence of GSDMD via chemical or <italic>Salmonella-</italic>induced NLRP3 inflammasome activation that also included Caspase-8 activation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib74">Zhou and Abbott, 2021</xref>). In contrast, we were unable to detect Caspase-8 activation in our system. Therefore, we propose that the cascade revealed in our work involves direct Caspase-3 activation by Caspase-1, as was previously suggested for AIM2 inflammasome in the absence of Caspase-8 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib55">Sagulenko et al., 2018</xref>).</p><p>In the battle between mammalian cells and pathogens, the immune response mechanism that is activated plays a central role in the hostâs ability to fight-off infections. Inflammasome activation (and pyroptotic cell death), which is an ancient innate immune mechanism, is activated by numerous inputs and cellular stresses (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">Lamkanfi and Dixit, 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib60">Schroder and Tschopp, 2010</xref>). Nevertheless, the immunological consequences of inflammasome activation by pathogens remain enigmatic. Often it is a useful mechanism that enables the host to eliminate infection either by inducing inflammation or by killing infected cells; however, in certain scenarios, inflammasome activation can be exploited by the pathogen, and it provides it with an advantage against the immune system (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib41">Man et al., 2017</xref>). Indeed, we observed a T6SS3-mediated growth advantage to <italic>V. proteolyticus</italic> during BMDMs infection when phagocytosis, which is generally used by the immune cell to eliminate the bacteria, was functional. Future investigations will determine whether T6SS3-induced pyroptosis is beneficial to the bacterium or to the host during in vivo infection.</p><p>Although mammals are probably not the natural target for the <italic>V. proteolyticus</italic> T6SS3, nor are they the evolutionary driving force for the activity of the effectors Tie1 and Tie2, immune responses similar to the ones described here (e.g. cell death mechanisms) are found in marine animals that are in direct contact with pathogenic vibrios (e.g. arthropods and fish). Indeed, <italic>Vibrio coralliilyticus</italic> was recently described to activate Caspase-3, leading to cleavage of GSDME and cell death in corals (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Jiang et al., 2020</xref>), while a Caspase-1 homolog was previously described in <italic>Artemia sinica</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Chu et al., 2014</xref>). Since NLR proteins, such as NLRP3, are less conserved in marine animals, we hypothesize that the target of Tie1 and Tie2 is upstream of NLRP3, and therefore the conservation between mammalian cells and marine animals lies in their ability to sense the effect of Tie1 and Tie2 activity as a danger signal that activates cell death pathways. Moreover, since we find homologous T6SS clusters that carry Tie1 and Tie2 homologs in other bacteria, including human pathogens, this T6SS and these effectors may contribute to the virulence of some bacteria. Finally, the probable horizontal transfer of this anti-eukaryotic T6SS between marine bacteria may also contribute to the emergence of new pathogenic <italic>Vibrio</italic> strains.</p><p>Here, we also shed light on the regulation of T6SS3. We found that similar to T6SS in other bacteria, both T6SS1 and T6SS3 in <italic>V. proteolyticus</italic> are repressed by H-NS. Importantly, we demonstrated that Ats3, which appears to be conserved also in the homologous T6SS clusters found in other bacteria, is an activator of T6SS3 but not of T6SS1. When over-expressed, Ats3 activated T6SS3 even more dramatically than the deletion of <italic>hns1</italic>. Interestingly, the Ats3-induced T6SS3 activated NLRP3 independent cell death in BMDMs, which had different kinetics than the NLRP3-mediated cell death. This result suggests that upon hyper-activation, T6SS3 can induce different cell death mechanisms.</p><p>In conclusion, we describe T6SS3, an anti-eukaryotic T6SS in <italic>V. proteolyticus</italic>, and we identify two novel anti-eukaryotic effectors. We also decipher the mechanism of cell death, which is induced by the two effectors in primary macrophages. Nevertheless, future studies will address the question regarding the activity and target of the two effectors, and they will determine how these effectors activate the inflammasome. Moreover, it remains to be determined whether inflammasome-induced cell death is beneficial to the host or to the bacterium during infection.</p></sec><sec id="s4" sec-type="materials|methods"><title>Materials and methods</title><sec id="s4-1"><title>Reagents</title><p>Unless otherwise stated, all cell culture reagents were purchased from Biological Industries, Beit-Haemek, Israel.

The labelling of the figures is pretty complicated with the long genetic designations. Is it reasonable to for example name the âvprh/âhns1 strain with an abbreviation (such as âVH)? Or instead create a strain name, common used approaches would be HC## (for Hadar Cohen) or TAU# for Tel Aviv University. If you go this route, be sure to update the strain list. The current method can be followed, the figures are just complicated.</p></disp-quote><p>We thank the reviewer for raising this concern. We acknowledge the difficulty in following the many different strains and mutations. Nevertheless, after considering the proposed modifications to the strain names, we believe that they will not add much clarity, and may even cause some confusion. Therefore, we respectfully decided to keep the current nomenclature in place.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Reviewer #2:</p><p>Minor edits</p><p>1. The authors used a hyperactive T6SS (HNS mutant) to investigate its toxicity. Would the authors be able to use a wild type strain to reproduce the function of T6SS?</p></disp-quote><p>We have yet to reveal the external cues that lead to full activation of T6SS3 in vitro. Therefore, in the current study we used genetic tools, such as <italic>hns</italic> deletion or Ats3 over-expression, to monitor the effect of this system on immune cells. We will dissect the activating conditions in future studies, but we believe that the use of genetic tools should not affect the validity of the results in the current study, nor their timely publication.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>2. The authors showed that Tie1 and Tie2 are secreted by T6SS3. It is important to show if they are actually delivered into the host cells during infection. Otherwise it is hard to conclude that they are truly effectors. The primary concern is the lack of in vivo studies to show that Tie1 and Tie2 are actually effectors that play a role in activation of NLRP3 inflammasome.</p></disp-quote><p>We present 3 pieces of evidence that, when taken together, support the conclusion that Tie1 and Tie2 are T6SS3 effectors: (1) the proteins are secreted in a T6SS3-dependent manner; (2) their deletion does not hamper overall T6SS3 activity; and (3) their deletion causes the same loss of NLRP3-mediated inflammasome activation and pyroptosis as does inactivation of T6SS3 by deletion of its structural component, <italic>tssL3</italic>. Although we agree with the reviewer that directly showing delivery of Tie1 and Tie2 into host cells will further strengthen our conclusion, such experiments are quite challenging and difficult to interpret, especially with T6SS effectors that can use diverse mechanisms for secretion through the system. This point was also noted by reviewer #3: ââ¦I believe they were suggesting to demonstrate secretion in host cells. Although this would be nice, it is non-standard and technically not feasible. These types of experiments require genetically fusing the effector with either an enzymatic moiety (e.g. Î lactamase) or fragment of split GFP. Although such approaches have been previously performed, they often result in either blocked or aberrant secretion due to the presence of the added fragment.&quot;</p><p>Regarding the reviewerâs comment on the lack of in vivo studies: we agree that these are extremely important, yet they are beyond the scope of the current work, as concurred by reviewers #1 and #3:</p><p>Reviewer#1 with regard to Reviewer#2: &quot;I don't think mouse (or aquatic animal) studies are essential for this study. The work contributes nicely to our understanding molecular mechanisms of this T6SS system. As noted in my review, there are many additional lines of study that can be pursued from this work, including animal studies, but this should not preclude publication of this work that is itself an intact unit.&quot;</p><p>Reviewer#3 regarding reviewer #1's comment on Reviewer#2: &quot;I don't believe that reviewer #2 was suggesting to perform mouse or aquatic animal studies by suggesting in vivo demonstration of secretionâ¦â</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Reviewer #3:</p><p>Major comments:</p><p>1. If the authors believe that GSDME partially compensates in the absence of GSDMD, have they infected a GSDME/GSDMD double knockouts to see if there is an additive effect?</p></disp-quote><p>Indeed, this is a very interesting and specific question for the cell death field. We do not currently possess such a GSDME/GSDMD double knockout mouse, and generating one will be a long endeavor. Since its absence does not diminish the importance or the conclusions of the current work, we think that it should not warrant a delay in publication. We do plan to address this question in future studies.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>2. It is clear that Ats3 regulates T6SS3, but not the T6SS1; however, there no evidence suggesting that Atg3 does not regulate other gene clusters. For example, have the authors performed RNA seq to compare the transcriptomes of WT and an Ats3 mutant? If not, the authors should refrain using the words &quot;specific activation&quot;.</p></disp-quote><p>We thank the reviewer for this important note. Indeed, we lack additional data indicating that Ats3âs effect is indeed restricted only to T6SS3. Therefore, we modified the text accordingly and removed mentions of specific T6SS3 activation.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>3. In figure 6B, it's unclear why the bacteria infecting cytochalasin D-treated cells grow more than the T6SS3 mutants in the absence of cytochalasin D.</p></disp-quote><p>The difference probably stems from the fact that phagocytosis, the major mechanisms by which BMDMs kill bacteria, is hampered in the presence of cytochalasin D, thus allowing bacteria to grow more than when the BMDMs phagocytose them. The results show that in the absence of cytochalasin D, an active T6SS3 counteracts the killing effect by BMDMs with functional phagocytosis.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Minor comments:</p><p>4. Figure 1A and other secretion assays: The Western blots include loading control (LC) blots. These are non-standard, non-informative, and not required with the inclusion of the western blots on the &quot;cells&quot; fraction. I would suggest removing these as they may confuse the reader.</p></disp-quote><p>We respectfully disagree. Loading controls are standard in bacterial secretion assays, and they are important since they confirm comparable loading and allow proper analysis of the results, especially since we aim to determine whether certain mutations affect the expression of T6SS components. Notably, some groups choose to blot for a cytoplasmic protein (e.g., RpoB in Allsop et al., PNAS, 2017; Liang et al., PLoS Pathogens, 2021) instead of showing overall loaded proteins, as shown in our figures.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>5.

Since <italic>V. proteolyticus</italic> is an aquatic pathogen, have the authors tried to infect corals, fish, and crustaceans (or derived cells) with WT and effector mutants?</p></disp-quote><p>This is an interesting point, and indeed we are setting up such systems and we plan to perform such experiments in the future as part of follow up projects. However, these in vivo studies are beyond the scope of the current manuscript, as also noted by the reviewer in the cross-consultation comments: ââ¦my previous comment on infecting aquatic animals or cells derived from them is non-standard and not necessaryâ¦â</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>7. Are the targeted host proteins in this study (performed with murine BMDM) conserved in the natural hosts for <italic>V. proteolyticus</italic>?</p></disp-quote><p>We hypothesize that the conservation is not in the pathway components that are activated upon infection, but rather in the ability of the host cell to sense danger (i.e., to sense the effect of T6SS3 effectors on the host cell or one of its components), which is the role of the NLRP3 inflammasome in mammalian cells. It is well documented that major differences in immune mechanisms exist between mammals and the potential natural marine hosts of <italic>V. proteolyticus</italic> (e.g., corals, arthropods, and fish); therefore, the conservation at the protein level is low. Nevertheless, basic signaling pathways, such as programed cell death, are conserved between the different phyla. For example, a caspase-1 homolog which was found in arthropods (Chu, B. et al. PLoS One (2014). doi:10.1371/journal.pone.0085343) probably induces an apoptotic-like cell death mechanism, similar to apoptosis in <italic>C. elegans</italic>. We now provide further discussion on this point in the text (lines 648-659).</p></body></sub-article></article>
