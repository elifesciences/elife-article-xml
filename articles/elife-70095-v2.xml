Gas exchange and C<sup>18</sup>O<sup>16</sup>O discrimination measurements revealed that targeted expression of SiPIP2;7 enhanced the conductance to CO<sub>2</sub> diffusion from the intercellular airspace to the mesophyll cytosol.

The significant contribution of aquaporins to increased CO<sub>2</sub> diffusion has been demonstrated in C<sub>3</sub> plants (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Flexas et al., 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Hanba et al., 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib52">Sade et al., 2010</xref>). Aquaporins have key roles in regulating the movement of water and solutes into roots and between tissues, cells and organelles (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib58">Tyerman et al., 2021</xref>). These pore-forming integral membrane proteins can be divided into multiple sub-families depending on their amino acid sequence and subcellular localization. The PIPs (<underline>p</underline>lasma membrane <underline>i</underline>ntrinsic <underline>p</underline>roteins) are the only sub family, to date, known to permeate CO<sub>2</sub> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib62">Uehlein et al., 2017</xref>). The PIPs are subdivided into paralog groups PIP1s and PIP2s, based on sequence homology (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Azad et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Chaumont et al., 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Groszmann et al., 2016</xref>). Typically, PIP2s show higher water permeability when expressed in heterologous systems (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Chaumont et al., 2000</xref>) and PIP1s seemingly require interaction with a PIP2 to correctly traffic to the plasma membrane (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Berny et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib71">Zelazny et al., 2007</xref>). In plants, a number of CO<sub>2</sub> permeable PIPs have been identified including <italic>Arabidopsis thaliana</italic> AtPIP1;2 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Heckwolf et al., 2011</xref>) and AtPIP2;1 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib68">Wang et al., 2016</xref>); <italic>Hordeum vulgare</italic> HvPIP2;1, HvPIP2;2, HvPIP2;3, and HvPIP2;5 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">Mori et al., 2014</xref>); <italic>Nicotiana tabacum</italic> NtPIP1;5 (NtAQP1) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">De Rosa et al., 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib60">Uehlein et al., 2003</xref>) and <italic>Zea mays</italic> ZmPIP1;5 and ZmPIP1;6 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Heinen et al., 2014</xref>).</p><p>The roles of the CO<sub>2</sub> permeable aquaporins have been largely characterized in C<sub>3</sub> photosynthetic plants where aquaporins localized in both the plasma membrane and the chloroplast envelope have been shown to facilitate CO<sub>2</sub> diffusion from the intercellular airspace to the site of Rubisco in chloroplasts (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Kaldenhoff, 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib61">Uehlein et al., 2008</xref>). The capacity for CO<sub>2</sub> diffusion to the initial sites of carboxylation influences the amount of water loss through transpiration (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Cousins et al., 2020</xref>). Therefore, by providing a more efficient pathway for CO<sub>2</sub> diffusion, these membrane pores may contribute to increasing the water-use-efficiency (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Groszmann et al., 2016</xref>). However, little is known about the role of CO<sub>2</sub> permeable aquaporins and their influence on CO<sub>2</sub> diffusion from substomatal cavities to the first site of carboxylation in C<sub>4</sub> photosynthesis. The C<sub>4</sub> photosynthetic pathway is a biochemical CO<sub>2</sub> pump where the initial conversion of CO<sub>2</sub> to bicarbonate (HCO<sub>3</sub><sup>−</sup>) by carbonic anhydrase (CA) and subsequent fixation of phosphoenolpyruvate (PEP) by PEP carboxylase (PEPC) takes place in the cytosol of mesophyll cells. The pathway requires a close collaboration between mesophyll and bundle sheath cells and this constrains leaf anatomy limiting mesophyll surface area that forms a diffusive interface for CO<sub>2</sub> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Evans and Von Caemmerer, 1996</xref>). Mesophyll conductance is defined as the conductance to CO<sub>2</sub> diffusion from the intercellular airspace to the mesophyll cytosol (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Evans and Von Caemmerer, 1996</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib43">Osborn et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib59">Ubierna et al., 2017</xref>). Although the rate of C<sub>4</sub> photosynthesis is almost saturated at ambient <italic>p</italic>CO<sub>2</sub>, current modelling suggests that higher mesophyll conductance can increase assimilation rate and water-use-efficiency at low intercellular CO<sub>2</sub> partial pressures which occur when stomatal conductance is low (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib66">von Caemmerer and Furbank, 2016</xref>).</p><p><italic>Setaria italica</italic> (foxtail millet) and <italic>Setaria viridis</italic> (green foxtail) are C<sub>4</sub> grasses of the Paniceae tribe and Poaceae family, related to important agronomical crops such as <italic>Z. mays</italic> (maize) and <italic>Sorghum bicolor</italic> (sorghum). <italic>S. viridis</italic> is frequently used as a model species for C<sub>4</sub> photosynthesis research as it is diploid with a relatively small genome that is sequenced and can be easily transformed (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Brutnell et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Ermakova et al., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib43">Osborn et al., 2017</xref>).

Overexpression of CO<sub>2</sub> permeable aquaporins with the aim to enhance leaf CO<sub>2</sub> diffusion has been extensively probed in C<sub>3</sub> plants. Many studies have demonstrated that it was an effective strategy to improve <italic>g</italic><sub>m</sub>, leading to increased assimilation rate or grain yield (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Flexas et al., 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Hanba et al., 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib60">Uehlein et al., 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib69">Xu et al., 2019</xref>). However, some published research could not identify a functional link between the CO<sub>2</sub> permeable aquaporins and mesophyll conductance, and possible explanations include functional redundancy between aquaporin isoforms (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">Kromdijk et al., 2020</xref>) and complications of expressing membrane proteins in the chloroplast envelope (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Fernández-San Millán et al., 2018</xref>). In contrast to C<sub>3</sub> plants, where CO<sub>2</sub> needs to cross both plasma membrane and the chloroplast envelope to reach the site of carboxylation, the primary carboxylation step in C<sub>4</sub> plants occurs in the cytosol of mesophyll cells. Due to high photosynthetic rates of C<sub>4</sub> plants, this generates a large CO<sub>2</sub> drawdown between the intercellular airspaces and the cytosol and thus a large mesophyll conductance (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Evans and Von Caemmerer, 1996</xref>). Because only one membrane needs to be traversed by CO<sub>2</sub>, C<sub>4</sub> plants could serve as a simpler model to demonstrate the effect of CO<sub>2</sub> permeable aquaporins on photosynthesis.</p><p>Screening <italic>S. italica</italic> PIPs for CO<sub>2</sub> permeability in a yeast heterologous system resulted in identification of SiPIP2;7 as a CO<sub>2</sub> pore (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1c</xref>).

We confirmed the localization of SiPIP2;7 within the mesophyll plasma membranes (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2c</xref>) and detected the increase in CO<sub>2</sub> diffusion across the mesophyll membranes in transgenic plants by two independent methods.

Since PEPC and CA activities were not altered in plants expressing <italic>SiPIP2;7</italic> (<xref ref-type="table" rid="table1">Table 1</xref>), higher initial slopes of the <italic>AC</italic><sub>i</sub> curves in transgenic lines were attributed to the increased <italic>g</italic><sub>m</sub>.

However, overexpression of aquaporins is likely accompanied by confounding factors which could explain the lack of phenotype observed from the plants with the highest SiPIP2;7 expression level (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s2">Figure 3—figure supplement 2</xref>) and plants of line 52 showing significant increase of only initial slopes (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4</xref>). These factors possibly include the transport of multiple substrate(s) by SiPIP2;7 and different efficiency of SiPIP2;7 targeting to the plasma membrane between the individual lines, plants, leaves, and even between different mesophyll cells.

We also include an acceptance summary that explains what the editors found interesting or important about the work.</p></boxed-text><p><bold>Decision letter after peer review:</bold></p><p>Thank you for submitting your article &quot;Expression of a CO<sub>2</sub>-permeable aquaporin enhances mesophyll conductance in the C<sub>4</sub> species <italic>Setaria viridis</italic>&quot; for consideration by <italic>eLife</italic>. Your article has been reviewed by 3 peer reviewers, one of whom is a member of our Board of Reviewing Editors, and the evaluation has been overseen by Jürgen Kleine-Vehn as the Senior Editor. The following individual involved in review of your submission has agreed to reveal their identity: Berkley Walker (Reviewer #2).</p><p>The reviewers have discussed their reviews with one another, and the Reviewing Editor has drafted this to help you prepare a revised submission.</p><p>All three reviewers found the question to be interesting. The work generated and analysed transformants of Setaria with a putative CO2-permeable aquaporin and found evidence of improved photosynthesis. The whole question of whether modulating aquaporins can overcome non-stomatal conductance is very exciting and important. All reviewers also felt that the text describes some nice physiological measurements on both yeast and plants, and these seem to support the idea.</p><p>However, all three reviews hit on major concerns, which could be addressed in the following ways:</p><p>Essential revisions:</p><p>1. There is a clear need to unambiguously establish the connection between the observed photosynthetic effects and the aquaporin content. This is especially important given that other efforts have run into the problem that the reported increases in photosynthesis could not be unambiguously attributed to the specific manipulations. Hopefully, the team will have saved back lines that could be tested relatively rapidly to address this issue.</p><p>2. The observed increase in photosynthesis at high Ci does not seem to fit into the expected model. If this cannot be explained, it suggests an unexpected, secondary effect. That would be also important, and might turn out to be more interesting in the long run, but would require some changes to the story.</p><p>There were also some interesting discussions covered in the specific reviews, e.g., the applicability of aquaporins to C3 versus C4 plants, which could add to the impact of the work.</p><p><italic>Reviewer #1 (Recommendations for the authors):</italic></p><p>The key issue that must be addressed is #2, above.

I was more challenged by the data shown in Figure 4c where, due to the limited number of data points, it is possible to interpret the data several ways (e.g., line 52 suggests you can get a large shift in assimilation rate without major change in gm.

There is a clear need to unambiguously establish the connection between the observed photosynthetic effects and the aquaporin content. This is especially important given that other efforts have run into the problem that the reported increases in photosynthesis could not be unambiguously attributed to the specific manipulations.

The observed increase in photosynthesis at high Ci does not seem to fit into the expected model. If this cannot be explained, it suggests an unexpected, secondary effect.

We have now added Figure 3—figure supplement 2 to the manuscript where we explored the relationship between the relative abundance of PIP2;7 and the initial slopes/saturating parts of the ACi curves in individual plants of four transgenic lines. Modelling of the initial slope of the ACi curves compared to sample-specific protein accumulation found a significant second order polynomial relationship (R<sup>2</sup> = 0.345, p &lt; 0.05, F = 5.007, df = 2 and 19) which was significantly better than that achieved using a linear model (p &lt; 0.05). No improvement to these models could be achieved by addition of random effects accounting for transgenic event or zygosity of samples.</p><p>Moreover, Figure 3—figure supplement 2c unambiguously demonstrates that PIP2;7 expression does not influence the maximum rates of assimilation (<italic>A</italic><sub>max</sub>), as no significant relationship could be found using linear and mixed effects modelling methods. Dr Andrew Bowerman has performed this statistical analysis in R and joined as a co-author.</p><p>Interestingly, the highest expressing plants did not show a further increase of the initial slope, as a predicted maximum effect was found to be at 1.65 (r.u.) protein content.

This, as Reviewer 2 mentioned, is one of the strengths of our work since we selected the lines based on the expression level and not a photosynthetic phenotype.

Based on previous functional studies, there are now consensus sequence signatures associated with different substrates. In Supplementary File 2 we show that eight SiPIPs, including PIP2;7, match the current consensus sequence for CO<sub>2</sub> transport. Thus, although our work supports the current CO<sub>2</sub> sequence, more large-scale functional studies are required to narrow down the consensus signatures for multiples substrates.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>The proper controls are vital.

Choosing the right controls is complicated and largely depends on the model species and a nature of experiments. Based on our previous experience with <italic>Setaria viridis</italic> transgenics, azygous lines that went through the process of transformation but do not exhibit positional effects of insertions that are possible in the empty vector lines, present a good compromise.
