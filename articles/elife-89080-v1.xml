However, diverse eukaryotes from unicellular organisms, through echinoderms to vertebrates, use the actomyosin network during biomineralization. Specifically, the actomyosin remodeling protein, Rho-associated coiled-coil kinase (ROCK) regulates cell differentiation and gene expression in vertebrates’ biomineralizing cells, yet, little is known on ROCK’s role in invertebrates’ biomineralization. Here, we reveal that ROCK controls the formation, growth, and morphology of the calcite spicules in the sea urchin larva. ROCK expression is elevated in the sea urchin skeletogenic cells downstream of the Vascular Endothelial Growth Factor (VEGF) signaling. ROCK inhibition leads to skeletal loss and disrupts skeletogenic gene expression. ROCK inhibition after spicule formation reduces the spicule elongation rate and induces ectopic spicule branching. Similar skeletogenic phenotypes are observed when ROCK is inhibited in a skeletogenic cell culture, indicating that these phenotypes are due to ROCK activity specifically in the skeletogenic cells. Reduced skeletal growth and enhanced branching are also observed under direct perturbations of the actomyosin network. We propose that ROCK and the actomyosin machinery were employed independently, downstream of distinct GRNs, to regulate biomineral growth and morphology in Eukaryotes.</p></abstract><kwd-group kwd-group-type="author-keywords"><kwd>biomineralization</kwd><kwd>ROCK</kwd><kwd>actomyosin</kwd><kwd>sea urchin</kwd><kwd>skeletogenesis</kwd><kwd>tubulogenesis</kwd></kwd-group><kwd-group kwd-group-type="research-organism"><title>Research organism</title><kwd>Other</kwd></kwd-group><funding-group><award-group id="fund1"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100003977</institution-id><institution>Israel Science Foundation</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>211/20</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Ben-Tabou de-Leon</surname><given-names>Smadar</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund2"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution>ANATOMIX</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>20200811</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Politi</surname><given-names>Yael</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><funding-statement>The funders had no role in study design, data collection and interpretation, or the decision to submit the work for publication.</funding-statement></funding-group><custom-meta-group><custom-meta specific-use="meta-only"><meta-name>Author impact statement</meta-name><meta-value>ROCK and the actomyosin network are essential for multiple aspects of sea urchin skeletogenesis, suggesting an independent deployment of these factors in biomineralization across Eukaryotes.</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta specific-use="meta-only"><meta-name>publishing-route</meta-name><meta-value>prc</meta-value></custom-meta></custom-meta-group></article-meta></front><body><sec id="s1" sec-type="intro"><title>Introduction</title><p>Biomineralization is the process in which organisms from the five kingdoms of life, use minerals to produce shells, skeletons, and teeth that protect and support them (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib71">Weiner and Addadi, 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib47">Murdock and Donoghue, 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Knoll, 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Gilbert et al., 2022</xref>).

This explanation is in line with the dissimilar GRNs and biomineralization proteins that drive biomineralization in different phyla (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Ben-Tabou de-Leon, 2022</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Kawasaki et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib68">Tucker and Sharpe, 2004</xref>).

There is a tight association between actin filaments and the biomineralization compartment in diatoms (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib67">Tesson and Hildebrand, 2010b</xref>) and a highly dynamic actin organization that forms the biomineralization compartment in foraminifera (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib69">Tyszka et al., 2019</xref>). Perturbations of actin polymerization result in severely deformed shells and inhibition of shell shedding in coccolithophores (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">Langer et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Durak et al., 2017</xref>) and diatoms (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib66">Tesson and Hildebrand, 2010a</xref>). In vertebrates, Rho GTPases and ROCK, regulate chondrocytes, osteoblasts, and odontoblasts differentiation and affect gene expression in these biomineralizing cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib62">Strzelecka-Kiliszek et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib53">Qin et al., 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Huang et al., 2018</xref>). However, the roles of actomyosin remodeling in controlling mineral deposition and shaping biomineral morphology, are still unclear.</p><p>Sea urchin larval skeletogenesis provides an attractive model to study the role of the actomyosin network in biomineralization. Sea urchin larval skeletons are made of two frameworks of interconnected calcite rods, termed ‘spicules’ that are generated by the skeletogenic cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib45">Morgulis et al., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib50">Oliveri et al., 2008</xref>). To make the spicules, the skeletogenic cells form a ring with two lateral skeletogenic clusters and fuse through their filopodia forming a pseudopodia cable that links them into a syncytium (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Ettensohn and Dey, 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Gildor et al., 2021</xref>). The mineral is concentrated in the form of amorphous calcium carbonate (ACC) inside intracellular vesicles (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Kahil et al., 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Kahil et al., 2023</xref>). The vesicles are secreted into the biomineralization compartment generated in the skeletogenic cell clusters forming two triradiate spicules (Figure 8A, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Kahil et al., 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib70">Vidavsky et al., 2014</xref>). The tubular biomineralization compartment, also called the spicule cavity, elongates within the pseudopodia cable by localized mineral deposition at the tip of each rod (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib72">Wilt et al., 2008</xref>).</p><p>The GRN that controls sea urchin skeletogenesis is known in great detail and is highly similar to the GRN that controls vertebrates’ vascularization, suggesting a common evolutionary origin of these two tubulogenesis programs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib45">Morgulis et al., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib50">Oliveri et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Adomako-Ankomah and Ettensohn, 2013</xref>). As the spicules elongate, the expression of key regulatory and biomineralization-related genes becomes restricted to the skeletogenic cells proximal to the growing tips, possibly to promote mineral deposition at these sites (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib63">Sun and Ettensohn, 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib64">Tarsis et al., 2022</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib46">Morgulis et al., 2021</xref>). Localized gene expression is regulated by signaling cues such as the VEGF signaling (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Adomako-Ankomah and Ettensohn, 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib63">Sun and Ettensohn, 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib64">Tarsis et al., 2022</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Duloquin et al., 2007</xref>). However, how the skeletogenic GRN drives spicule formation and localized mineral deposition at the tips of the rods is poorly understood.</p><p>Previous works suggest that the actomyosin network is essential for sea urchin skeletal growth. Calcium-bearing vesicles perform an active diffusion motion in the skeletogenic cells with a diffusion length that inversely correlates with the strength and activity of the actomyosin network (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib73">Winter et al., 2021</xref>). Actin filaments are formed around the spicule (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib73">Winter et al., 2021</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib61">Stepicheva et al., 2017</xref>) and F-actin signal is enriched at the tips of the growing skeletal rods in skeletogenic cell culture (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib44">Moreno et al., 2019</xref>). Genetic and pharmacological perturbations of the GTPase, CDC42, prevent the formation of filopodia in the skeletogenic cells and inhibit spicule formation and elongation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib58">Sepúlveda-Ramírez et al., 2018</xref>). Pharmacological perturbations of ROCK prevent spicule formation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Croce et al., 2006</xref>) and genetic perturbations of Rhogap24l/2 result in ectopic spicule splitting (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib45">Morgulis et al., 2019</xref>). Despite these characterizations, little is known about the role of the actomyosin machinery in regulating sea urchin biomineral growth and morphology.</p><p>Here, we study the role of ROCK and the actomyosin network in the sea urchin <italic>Paracentrotus lividus (P. lividus</italic>).

We used a commercial antibody that recognizes human ROCK protein to test ROCK expression in <italic>P. lividus</italic> embryos. We first used western blot to detect ROCK expression in control and under VEGFR inhibition at the time of spicule formation and during skeletal elongation (Axitinib treatment, ~22 hpf, 27hpf, and 33hpf, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s2">Figure 1—figure supplement 2D</xref>). The antibody detected a ~150 kDa protein (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s2">Figure 1—figure supplement 2D</xref>) that is the predicted size for <italic>P. lividus</italic> ROCK protein (153 kDa). VEGFR inhibition marginally increased the overall level of ROCK at 22hpf, but did not affect it at 27hpf and 33hpf (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s2">Figure 1—figure supplement 2E</xref>). Yet, this measurement was done on proteins extracted from whole embryos, of which the skeletogenic cells, where VEGFR is active, are less than 5% of the total cell mass (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">Massri et al., 2021</xref>). We, therefore, wanted to study the spatial expression of ROCK and specifically, its regulation in the skeletogenic cells.</p><p>We studied the spatial distribution of ROCK protein using ROCK antibody and the skeletal cell marker, 6a9, that marks the skeletogenic syncytium membrane, in control and under VEGFR inhibition (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Ettensohn and McClay, 1988</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1</xref>). We quantified ROCK signal in the skeletogenic cells compared to the neighboring ectodermal cells in both conditions, at the three timepoints mentioned above. In the three timepoints, under VEGFR inhibition, the skeletogenic cells do not migrate to their proper positions in the anterolateral and post-oral chains, as previously reported (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib45">Morgulis et al., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Adomako-Ankomah and Ettensohn, 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Duloquin et al., 2007</xref>). At 22hpf, ROCK expression in the skeletogenic cells is mildly enriched compared to the neighboring ectodermal cells, and this enrichment is not observed under VEGFR inhibition (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1A–F</xref>). At 27hpf, ROCK enrichment in the skeletogenic cells increases, but similar enrichment is observed under VEGFR inhibition (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1G–L</xref>). At 33hpf, ROCK enrichment in the skeletogenic cells is most apparent (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1M–O</xref>) and depends on VEGF signaling (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1P-S</xref>). At both 27hpf and 33hpf in control embryos, ROCK seems localized near the skeletogenic cell membranes, which further supports its activation in these cells, since ROCK activation leads to its localization to the cell membranes in other systems (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Chen et al., 2014</xref>). Overall, this data demonstrates that ROCK expression is elevated in the skeletogenic cells and this enrichment strengthens with skeletal elongation and depends on VEGF signaling.</p><fig-group><fig id="fig1" position="float"><label>Figure 1.</label><caption><title>Rho-associated coiled-coil kinase (ROCK) enrichment in the skeletogenic cells increases with time and depends on vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) signaling.</title><p>(<bold>A–R</bold>) ROCK immunostaining at different timepoints in control and under VEGFR inhibition (150 nM Axitinib).

Y27632 binds to the ATP site of ROCK’s kinase domain and prevents its activity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Jacobs et al., 2006</xref>). Y27632 affinity to ROCK is 100 times higher than its affinity to other kinases, such as PKA and PKC (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib49">Narumiya et al., 2000</xref>). The amino-acids to which Y27632 binds, are conserved in the sea urchin ROCK protein, supporting its specific inhibition of this protein (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1C</xref>). Y27632 had been used in cell cultures and live embryos from vertebrates to <italic>Drosophila,</italic> in concentrations between 10–100 µM (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib49">Narumiya et al., 2000</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib57">Segal et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib54">Rousso et al., 2016</xref>). In the sea urchin embryo, a concertation of 75 µM of Y27632 was reported to completely block skeleton formation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Croce et al., 2006</xref>) and a concentration of 100 µM was shown to delay gut invagination (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Beane et al., 2006</xref>). Therefore, we tested the range of 10–80 µM Y27632 applied before or after spicule initiation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s2">Figure 2—figure supplement 2A</xref>).</p><p>Continuous ROCK inhibition beginning at egg fertilization, resulted in significant skeletogenic phenotypes that are dose-dependent (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s2">Figure 2—figure supplement 2</xref>). Continuous ROCK inhibition using 80 µM Y27632, did not affect skeletogenic cell migration but eliminated skeletal formation at 27hpf (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s2">Figure 2—figure supplement 2B, C</xref>). At 2dpf, complete skeletal loss is detected under continuous ROCK inhibition in all concentrations, ranging from 15% of the embryos exposed to 10 µM to 67% of the embryos exposed to 80 µM Y27632 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2G and K</xref>, in agreement with <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Croce et al., 2006</xref>). The rest of the embryos exposed to continuous ROCK inhibition show either spicule initiations or small spicules with enhanced ectopic branching, with the percentage depending on Y27632 concertation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2K</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s2">Figure 2—figure supplement 2K</xref>). Except from the skeletogenic phenotypes, the overall embryonic development of embryos exposed to Y27632 in all concentrations seems normal (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2G and J</xref>). Similar results are observed when adding the inhibitor at 20hpf, with the distribution of phenotypes that depends on the concentration (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s2">Figure 2—figure supplement 2I, K</xref>). Importantly, skeletal loss, spicule initiation, and ectopic branching were not observed under PKC or PKA inhibition, that resulted in much milder skeletogenic phenotypes (PKC) or no skeletogenic phenotype (PKA, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib41">Mitsunaga et al., 1990a</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib42">Mitsunaga et al., 1990b</xref>), supporting the selective inhibition of ROCK by Y27632. Altogether, continuous ROCK inhibition results with severe skeletogenic phenotype ranging from complete skeletal loss to small spicules with ectopic branching, with ratios that depend on the inhibitor concentration.</p><p>The addition of the inhibitor at 25hpf, after spicule initiation, results in a majority of embryos showing ectopic spicule branching (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2H–K</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s2">Figure 2—figure supplement 2F-H, K</xref>). The reduction of skeletal growth rate and ectopic branching can be observed a few hours after the addition of ROCK inhibitor (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s3">Figure 2—figure supplement 3</xref>, 30 µM). Washing the inhibitor at the highest concertation after 25hpf results in partial recovery of skeletogenesis, with normal or mildly delayed skeletons, indicating that ROCK inhibition is reversible (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s2">Figure 2—figure supplement 2E, K</xref>).</p><p>Overall, the genetic and pharmacological perturbations of ROCK result in a sever reduction of skeletal growth and enhanced skeletal branching, but only continuous ROCK inhibition leads to complete skeletal loss (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2G and K</xref>). Immunostaining of fertilized eggs clearly shows that ROCK protein is maternal, in agreement with our RNA-seq data (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s2">Figure 1—figure supplement 2A–C</xref>). The injected MASO’s cannot interfere with the maternal ROCK protein whereas the inhibitor affects the activity of both maternal and zygotic ROCK, which could underlie the absence of skeletal loss in the genetic perturbations. Indeed, the ROCK signal is only moderately reduced in ROCK MASO-injected embryos at 33hpf (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s1">Figure 2—figure supplement 1F, J, N</xref>), demonstrating the partial penetration of the MASO. Thus, our genetic and pharmacological perturbations reconcile, and indicate that ROCK activity is necessary for spicule formation, skeletal elongation, and normal branching pattern.</p><p>To test if ROCK skeletogenic phenotypes are due to its activity specifically in the skeletogenic cells, we inhibited ROCK in a culture of isolated skeletogenic cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2L–P</xref>). The addition of ROCK inhibitor to the skeletogenic cell culture at 16hpf, before the spicules form, completely abolished spicule formation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2M</xref>). The addition of the inhibitor at 48hpf, after spicule formation, resulted in significantly shorter spicules (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2L and N</xref>) and increased branching compared to control spicules (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2O</xref>). The reduction of the spicule length becomes more significant with increasing concentration of the ROCK inhibitor (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2P</xref>). Notably, skeletal loss and ectopic spicule branching were not observed in PKA or PKC inhibition in skeletogenic cell cultures (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib42">Mitsunaga et al., 1990b</xref>), further supporting the selective inhibition of ROCK by Y27632. ROCK skeletogenic phenotypes in the isolated skeletogenic cell culture are similar to its phenotypes in whole embryos, verifying that ROCK activity in the skeletogenic cells is essential for spicule formation, normal elongation, and prevention of branching.</p></sec><sec id="s2-3"><title>ROCK inhibition reduces spicule volume, surface area, and total length, but not thickness (SR-µCT)</title><p>To quantify the effect of ROCK inhibition on mineral deposition and skeletal shape we used synchrotron radiation micro-computed tomography (SR-µCT) that enables three-dimensional visualization and quantification of spicule morphology at 2 and 3dpf (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s1">Figure 3—figure supplement 1</xref>, 40 µM Y27632, see methods for details).

The number of calcein-stained vesicles is, however, decreased under ROCK inhibition, possibly indicating that there are fewer vesicles with larger volume. Addition of ROCK inhibitor at 25hpf affects neither the number of calcein-stained vesicles nor the number of calcein-stained pixels in the skeletogenic cells. Together, these measurements show that ROCK is not required for the uptake of calcium into the cells. Therefore, the skeletal phenotypes occurring under ROCK inhibition are not related to a decrease in calcium uptake or shortage in intracellular calcium, but are due to defects in mineral processing within the cells and in the mineral deposition.</p><p>To monitor the effect of ROCK inhibition on mineral deposition rate and distribution, we applied two pulses of different calcein dyes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Descoteaux et al., 2023</xref>): blue calcein was added at 29hpf and washed after 1 hr, followed by green calcein added at 44hpf and washed after 1 hr. Hence, blue calcein marks the initial triradiate region and green calcein marks the edges of the spicules that were recently deposited blue and green arrows in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3H I</xref>. The dye FM4-64 was used to mark the cell membranes. Under ROCK inhibition, the green labeled region is much closer to the blue labeled region compared to the control, due to the reduction in skeletal elongation rate, in agreement with our SR-µCT measurements. However, while in control embryos each body rod has a single tip stained in green calcein, under ROCK inhibition one of the body rods has two tips and both are stained in green. This indicates that mineral is being deposited in both edges, and the mechanism that prevents the growth of multiple tips in each rod, enabling ‘tip-dominance,’ (in analogy to plant stem apical dominance), is disrupted under ROCK inhibition.</p></sec><sec id="s2-5"><title>The activity of the actomyosin network is essential for normal spicule elongation and inhibition of ectopic branching</title><p>In other systems, the major roles of ROCK are to control F-actin polymerization and MyoII activation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">Liu et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Julian and Olson, 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Lecuit et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Amin et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib52">Pavlov et al., 2007</xref>), hence we wanted to directly test the role of these actomyosin components in sea urchin skeletogenesis.

The majority of the embryos where MyoII activation was inhibited show ectopic branching mostly at the tips of the rods, and a minor delay in skeletal growth (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4B, C and G</xref>). These phenotypes are quite similar to those observed in the addition of 10 µM of ROCK inhibitor at 25hpf (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2H and K</xref>). The majority of the embryos where F-actin formation was inhibited show a significant reduction of skeletal growth and severe ectopic skeletal branching (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4E and F</xref> and similar phenotypes to <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4D</xref>, statistics in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4G</xref>). These phenotypes are quite similar to those observed in 10 µM continuous inhibition of ROCK and the addition of 30 µM of ROCK inhibitor at 20hpf (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2H and K</xref>). In some embryos, additional spicules form (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4F and G</xref>). The co-inhibition of F-actin polymerization and MyoII activity results in skeletogenic phenotypes that resemble, but are slightly stronger, than those of the inhibition of F-actin alone (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4D and G</xref>). Thus, the phenotypes resulting from the inhibition of MyoII activation resemble those of the late inhibition of ROCK at low inhibitor concertation. The phenotypes resulting from the inhibition of actin polymerization resemble those of the continuous inhibition of ROCK in low inhibitor concertation and the late inhibition of ROCK at higher inhibitor concentrations, yet skeletal loss is only observed under ROCK continuous inhibition.</p><p>To test whether actin polymerization and myosin activity specifically in the skeletogenic cells underlies the observed skeletogenic phenotypes, we inhibit both in an isolated skeletogenic cell culture (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4H–K</xref>). We added the inhibitors after the spicule formed (&gt;48 hpf) and observed the phenotypes at 3dpf. Both inhibitors reduced skeletal growth, with Lantruculin-A having a significantly stronger effect than Blebbistatin (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4K</xref>), in agreement with the stronger skeletogenic phenotypes of Lantruculin-A in whole embryos. However, differently than in whole embryos, skeletal branching in both Lantruculin-A and Blebbistatin is not affected and is similar to the observed branching in control cultures. The absence of the branching phenotype in the skeletogenic cell culture could be due to the increased rigidity of the substrate that could compensate for the reduced actomyosin activity. Another option is that the branching phenotype in whole embryos is due to the reduction of the activity of the actomyosin network in non-skeletogenic cells. Nevertheless, these results indicate that normal skeletal growth depends primarily on F-actin polymerization and to a lesser extent, on myosin contractility in the skeletogenic cells.</p></sec><sec id="s2-6"><title>ROCK activity is required for F-actin organization around the forming spicule</title><p>The similarity between the skeletogenic phenotypes under ROCK inhibition and the direct perturbations of the actomyosin network led us to test the effect of ROCK inhibition on F-actin organization and MyoII activity.

Relatedly, a direct perturbation of F-actin polymerization strongly disrupts spicule growth and shape, but not spicule formation, indicating that F-actin is not essential for spicule initiation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4</xref>). We, therefore, propose that ROCK activity is necessary for spicule initiation, but not through its’ direct regulation of the actomyosin network, but though its other targets, yet to be identified (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8">Figure 8C</xref>).</p><p>After the spicule cavity has formed, the spicules elongate inside the pseudopodia chord by mineral deposition at the tips of the spicule rods, which depends on ROCK activity, on F-actin polymerization, and to a lesser extent, on MyoII contractility (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figures 2</xref>—<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">4</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8">8D–F</xref>). F-actin is detected along the spicules and is significantly enriched at the tips of the elongating spicules, independently of ROCK activity (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figures 5</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">6</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8">8D, E</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib40">Miklavc and Frick, 2020</xref>). Under ROCK inhibition and under the inhibition of F-actin polymerization, ectopic branching is observed at the tips and in the back (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2H, J, O</xref>; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3A, I</xref>; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4</xref>; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8">Figure 8E</xref>). MyoII inhibition results in ectopic branching at the tips of the rods (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4</xref>), that is similar to the effect of late ROCK inhibition at low concertation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2H and K</xref>). These correlative similarities between ROCK and the actomyosin perturbations lead us to the following speculations: the low dosage of late ROCK inhibition is perturbing mostly ROCK activation of MyoII contractility while the higher dosage affects factors that control actin polymerization (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8">Figure 8F</xref>). Further studies in higher temporal and spatial resolution of MyoIIP activity and F-actin structures in control and under ROCK inhibition will enable us to test this.</p><p>The participation of ROCK, F-actin, and MyoII in polarized growth and vesicle exocytosis has been observed in both animals and plants (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib40">Miklavc and Frick, 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Bibeau et al., 2018</xref>). F-actin is used for short-range myosin trafficking of vesicles toward the secretion site (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib40">Miklavc and Frick, 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Bond et al., 2011</xref>). Once the secretory vesicle fuses with the membrane, it is coated with F-actin that stabilizes the vesicle and enables MyoII binding and ROCK-regulated contraction, necessary for content secretion (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib57">Segal et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib54">Rousso et al., 2016</xref>). In plant cells, F-actin accumulates at the growing tip of the cell and assists in vesicle exocytosis necessary for polarized tip-growth (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Bibeau et al., 2018</xref>). ROCK, F-actin, and MyoII could be regulating the localized exocytosis of mineral-bearing vesicles during sea urchin skeletogenesis. The reduction of spicule growth rate and the enhanced branching could be due to impaired and misplaced vesicle trafficking and deposition under ROCK and F-actin inhibition. Detailed investigation of the kinetics and deposition of mineral-bearing vesicles and the role of the actomyosin network in these processes will illuminate the regulation of vesicle exocytosis during biomineralization.</p><p>ROCK activity is necessary for correct spatiotemporal expression of regulatory and biomineralization genes (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7</xref>). ROCK inhibition downregulates the expression level of skeletogenic genes (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7A</xref>) and prevents the spatial progression of key skeletogenic genes toward the edges of the skeletal rods (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figures 7</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8">8E</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7s1">Figure 7—figure supplement 1</xref>). This implies that ROCK activity provides regulatory cues to the skeletogenic GRN required for the dynamic progression of gene expression within the skeletogenic lineage. In other systems, ROCK activity was shown to regulate gene expression through various intracellular pathways (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib51">Olson and Nordheim, 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Knipe et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Khatiwala et al., 2009</xref>). Furthermore, ROCK has an important role in the mechano-sensing of matrix rigidity and transducing it into changes in gene expression (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib76">Zhong et al., 2020</xref>). Relatedly, stiff substrate activates ROCK in pre-osteoblastic cells in-vitro, which activates Erk that leads to osteogenic differentiation and upregulation of osteogenic gene expression (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Khatiwala et al., 2009</xref>). Sea urchin ROCK could be a part of the mechano-sensing mechanism that detects the high spicule stiffness and transduces it into gene expression, providing a necessary feedback between spicule elongation and the skeletogenic GRN.</p><p>Overall, our findings together with the role of the actomyosin network in biomineralization, from calcifying and silicifying single cells to vertebrates’ bones and teeth (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">Langer et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Durak et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib69">Tyszka et al., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib66">Tesson and Hildebrand, 2010a</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib67">Tesson and Hildebrand, 2010b</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib62">Strzelecka-Kiliszek et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib53">Qin et al., 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Huang et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Khatiwala et al., 2009</xref>), suggest that this molecular machinery is a part of the common molecular tool-kit of biomineralization. Most likely, the actomyosin network was employed independently, downstream of distinct GRNs across Eukaryotes, to control mineral growth and morphogenesis.</p></sec><sec id="s4" sec-type="methods"><title>Methods</title><table-wrap id="keyresource" position="anchor"><label>Key resources table</label><table frame="hsides" rules="groups"><thead><tr><th align="left" valign="bottom">Reagent type (species) or resource</th><th align="left" valign="bottom">Designation</th><th align="left" valign="bottom">Source or reference</th><th align="left" valign="bottom">Identifiers</th><th align="left" valign="bottom">Additional information</th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td align="left" valign="bottom">Antibody</td><td align="left" valign="bottom">ROCK2 +ROCK1 antibody</td><td align="left" valign="bottom">Abcam</td><td align="left" valign="bottom">AB-ab45171</td><td align="left" valign="bottom">IF (1:70)<break/>WB (1:300)</td></tr><tr><td align="left" valign="bottom">Sequence-based reagent</td><td align="left" valign="bottom">MASO</td><td align="left" valign="bottom">This paper</td><td align="left" valign="bottom">ROCK MASO1</td><td align="left" valign="bottom"><named-content content-type="sequence">AGACATATTTGGAGCCGA</named-content>[CAT]CCTG</td></tr><tr><td align="left" valign="bottom">Sequence-based reagent</td><td align="left" valign="bottom">MASO</td><td align="left" valign="bottom">This paper</td><td align="left" valign="bottom">ROCK MASO2</td><td align="left" valign="bottom"><named-content content-type="sequence">TCTCTTGCGTTATATTCCACTAAGT</named-content></td></tr><tr><td align="left" valign="bottom">Chemical compound, drug</td><td align="left" valign="bottom">Y27632</td><td align="left" valign="bottom">Cayman chemical</td><td align="left" valign="bottom">10005583 CAS Registry No. 129830-38-2</td><td align="left" valign="bottom">10–120 µM</td></tr><tr><td align="left" valign="bottom">Chemical compound, drug</td><td align="left" valign="bottom">Axitinib</td><td align="left" valign="bottom">Selleckchem, Houston, TX, USA</td><td align="left" valign="bottom">AG013736</td><td align="left" valign="bottom">150 nM</td></tr><tr><td align="left" valign="bottom">Chemical compound, drug</td><td align="left" valign="bottom">Latrunculin-A</td><td align="left" valign="bottom">Thermo Fisher Scientific</td><td align="left" valign="bottom">L12370</td><td align="left" valign="bottom">2 nM</td></tr><tr><td align="left" valign="bottom">Chemical compound, drug</td><td align="left" valign="bottom">Blebbistatin</td><td align="left" valign="bottom">Enco</td><td align="left" valign="bottom">13013–5</td><td align="left" valign="bottom">1.5–2 µM</td></tr></tbody></table></table-wrap><sec id="s4-1"><title>Animal and embryos</title><p>Adult <italic>Paracentrotous lividus</italic> were obtained from the Institute of Oceanographic and Limnological Research (IOLR) in Eilat, Israel.

The presence of ROCK in the pluteus stage depends on the activity of VEGF that is responsible for the formation of the tubular syncytial sheath of the calcifying primary mesenchyme cells in which the skeleton forms. The importance of ROCK in skeleton formation was confirmed in cell culture experiments, demonstrating that ROCK inhibition leads to decreased elongation and abnormal branching of spicules. µCT analyses underline this finding demonstrating that the inhibition of ROCK mainly affects elongation of spicules while growth in girth is little affected. F-actin labeling experiments could demonstrate that ROCK inhibition interferes with the organization of the actomyosin network in the early phase of skeleton formation, while f-actin organization in the tips of the elongating spicule is unaffected by the pharmacological inhibition of ROCK. Finally, ROCK inhibition strongly affects the expression of major regulatory and calcification-related genes in the calcifying cells. Based on these findings the authors propose a model for the regulatory interaction between the skeletogenic GRN, ROCK and the f-actin system relevant for skeletogenesis.</p><p>Comments on revised version:</p><p>In their manuscript Hijaze et al. adequately addressed the majority of my previous concerns in a satisfactory manner. In particular, they validated their morpholino knock-down experiments by explaining how they determined the optimal concentrations and provided an immunohistological evidence for the reduction in ROCK protein abundance. The authors also added new antibody stainings providing evidence that ROCK and F-actin do not interact directly but likely through other kinases that modulate f-actin, and that the localization of f-actin at the spicule tips remains unaffected by the knock-down. In addition, the authors revised their discussion to not overstate their observations, and by focusing on the potential mechanisms by which ROCK may affect biomineralization (i.e. mechano sensing and exocytosis of vesicles). Here I would like to add, that f-actin mediated exocytosis does not necessarily target mineral baring vesicles but may also promote the exocytosis of matrix proteins that are essential for the normal formation of the spicules and that are an integral component of other biominerals, as well. I strongly encourage the authors to continue on this exciting research, including the development of methods to analyze the molecular mechanisms that control vesicular trafficking in mineralizing systems.</p></body></sub-article><sub-article article-type="referee-report" id="sa2"><front-stub><article-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.89080.4.sa2</article-id><title-group><article-title>Reviewer #2 (Public Review):</article-title></title-group><contrib-group><contrib contrib-type="author"><anonymous/><role specific-use="referee">Reviewer</role></contrib></contrib-group></front-stub><body><p>This project is on the role of ROCK in skeletogenesis during sea urchin development. That skeleton is produced by a small number of cells in the embryo with signaling inputs from the ectoderm providing patterning cues. The skeleton is built from secretion of CaCO3 by the skeletogenic cells. The authors conclude that ROCK is involved in the regulation of skeletogenesis with a role both in regulating actomyosin in the process, and in the gene regulatory network (GRN) underlying the entire sequence of events.</p><p>The strength of the paper is that they show in detail how perturbations of ROCK results in abnormal actomyosin activity in the skeletogenic cells, and they show alterations both in expression of transcription factors of the GRN, and expression of genes involved in assembly of the skeletal matrix. Two different approaches lead to this conclusion: morpholino perturbations and the actions of a selective inhibitor of the kinase activity. Thus, they achieved their goal which was to test the hypothesis that ROCK is involved in the process of skeletogenesis. Those tests support the hypothesis with data that was quantitatively significant.</p><p>The discussion was transparent regarding where the analysis ended and where the next phase of work should begin. While actomyosin involvement was altered when ROCK was perturbed, it isn't known how direct or indirect the role of ROCK might be. Also, while the regulatory input to spicule initiation and growth is affected when ROCK is inhibited, it isn't clear exactly where ROCK is involved.</p></body></sub-article><sub-article article-type="author-comment" id="sa3"><front-stub><article-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.89080.4.sa3</article-id><title-group><article-title>Author response</article-title></title-group><contrib-group><contrib contrib-type="author"><name><surname>Ben-Tabou de-Leon</surname><given-names>Smadar</given-names></name><role specific-use="author">Author</role><aff><institution>University of Haifa</institution><addr-line><named-content content-type="city">Haifa</named-content></addr-line><country>Israel</country></aff></contrib><contrib contrib-type="author"><name><surname>Hijaze</surname><given-names>Eman</given-names></name><role specific-use="author">Author</role><aff><institution>University of Haifa</institution><addr-line><named-content content-type="city">Haifa</named-content></addr-line><country>Israel</country></aff></contrib><contrib contrib-type="author"><name><surname>Gildor</surname><given-names>Tsvia</given-names></name><role specific-use="author">Author</role><aff><institution>University of Haifa</institution><addr-line><named-content content-type="city">Haifa</named-content></addr-line><country>Israel</country></aff></contrib><contrib contrib-type="author"><name><surname>Seidel</surname><given-names>Ronald</given-names></name><role specific-use="author">Author</role><aff><institution>TU Dresden</institution><addr-line><named-content content-type="city">Dresden</named-content></addr-line><country>Germany</country></aff></contrib><contrib contrib-type="author"><name><surname>Layous</surname><given-names>Majed</given-names></name><role specific-use="author">Author</role><aff><institution>University of Haifa</institution><addr-line><named-content content-type="city">Haifa</named-content></addr-line><country>Israel</country></aff></contrib><contrib contrib-type="author"><name><surname>Winter</surname><given-names>Mark</given-names></name><role specific-use="author">Author</role><aff><institution>University of Haifa</institution><addr-line><named-content content-type="city">Haifa</named-content></addr-line><country>Israel</country></aff></contrib><contrib contrib-type="author"><name><surname>Bertinetti</surname><given-names>Luca</given-names></name><role specific-use="author">Author</role><aff><institution>TU Dresden</institution><addr-line><named-content content-type="city">Dresden</named-content></addr-line><country>Germany</country></aff></contrib><contrib contrib-type="author"><name><surname>Politi</surname><given-names>Yael</given-names></name><role specific-use="author">Author</role><aff><institution>TU Dresden</institution><addr-line><named-content content-type="city">Dresden</named-content></addr-line><country>Germany</country></aff></contrib></contrib-group></front-stub><body><p>The following is the authors’ response to the previous reviews.</p><p>Thank you and the two reviewers for the thorough review of our manuscript. We thank you very much for the positive evaluation of our manuscript and your encouragement to continue in this fascinating topic. In this version we made minor changes in the text to address the comments and suggestion of the second reviewer and increase the clarity of the text.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p><bold>Reviewer #2 Recommendation to the authors</bold></p></disp-quote><p>We thank the reviewer for the sharp comments that help us improve the clarity of the paper. Below we list the changes we made to correct and revise the paper in accordance to the reviewer’s comments.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>(1) Line 90. Isn't the genus Paracentrotus?</p></disp-quote><p>Yet it is, thank you. We corrected the typo.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>(2) Figure 1 and supplementary figure 2. To this reviewer supplementary Figure 2 doesn't really help the story as written in the paragraph from line 96-110. You want to report expression of ROCK in skeletogenic cells. You do that quite well in Figure 1. Since Fig. S2 reports whole embryo expression of ROCK when only 5% of the cells in the embryo are the subject of interest here, and the Axitinib is selective, presumably for skeletogenic cells, the relative lack of effect in Fig. S2 is not surprising and again, doesn't really help the theme you wish to establish by focusing on the role of ROCK in skeletogenic cells over time. If anything, the data reported in Fig. S2 shows that perturbation of VEGF signaling has very little effect embryo-wide, while Fig. 1 shows that perturbation of VEGF signaling has a noticeable effect on ROCK expression in skeletogenic cells. If you choose to keep Fig. S2, I recommend that you indicate that embryo-wide vs skeletogenic cell difference more succinctly than given at present. It will also strengthen your paragraph in lines 110-127.</p></disp-quote><p>The importance of the western blot presented in Fig. S2 is to validate that the antibody recognizes a protein of the expected size. This strengthen the credibility of this commercial antibody to detect the sea urchin ROCK protein. We agree with the reviewer that the fact that the skeletogenic cells are less than 5% of the embryonic cells is important to explain why we didn’t see an affect of VEGFR inhibition in the western blot, and we changed the text to express it (lines 108-111): “Yet, this measurement was done on proteins extracted from whole embryos, of which the skeletogenic cells, where VEGFR is active, are less than 5% of the total cell mass (42). We therefore wanted to study the spatial expression of ROCK and specifically, its regulation in the skeletogenic cells.”</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>(3) Comparison of Fig. 2 and Fig. S3. To me the reader is confused when Fig. S3 is 33hpf as reported in the text (but not in the figure legend), and Fig. 2 shows 2 day old embryos - on the figure and figure legend but not in the text. So, the reader sees the text indicating 33hpf and looks around and the figure 2 says 2dpf. Does that mean 33hpf = 2dpf, the reader is thinking. To clarify, I suggest including the 2dpf in the text or simply drop the time in the text and report it in the two figures. Further, in the middle of the paragraph 130-143 you switch from reporting on Fig.S3 to Fig. 2, yet the reader doesn't know that. The reader is still looking at Fig. S3. The problem here is that at 33hpf the skeleton doesn't yet show the reduction or abnormalities that are shown later at 2dpf in Fig. 2. In clarifying this paragraph both the reduction in ROCK expression and the subsequent alterations in growth and patterning of the skeleton will be clear to the reader.</p></disp-quote><p>Thank you for raising this point. We added in the caption of Fig. S3 that the measurements were done in 33hpf. We also added in the text, that the observations of the skeletogenic phenotypes were done at 2dpf (48hpf). We made a break between the first paragraph discussing Fig. S3 and the paragraph discussing Fig. 2.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>(4) The experiment with Y27632, an inhibitor of ROCK, is significantly improved in this revision. The concern earlier was the possibility that at the concentration used there might be off-target effects since other kinases are affected by higher concentrations of this selective inhibitor. The authors have modified this component of the paper and performed experiments at lower concentrations where other reports indicate the inhibitor is highly selective for ROCK, and they still demonstrate an inhibition of skeletal production. This, plus the added citations greatly increases confidence that this inhibition is selective for ROCK, thus enabling a stronger conclusion that ROCK has a role in skeletal growth and patterning.</p></disp-quote><p>Thank you for asking us to test this lower concentration which improved the credibility of our findings.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Line 239 - should be: indicating instead of indicting We corrected that.</p><p>(5) Line 402-403.&quot;The first step in generating the sea urchin spicules is the construction of the spicule cavity, a membrane filled with calcium carbonate and coated with F-actin (Fig. 8A)&quot;. I suggest more precise language. The way this now reads (above) is that somehow the spicule cavity is a membrane and that membrane is filled with CaCO3. And further the membrane is coated with F-actin. Isn't the spicule cavity what is filled with CaCO3? And isn't that cavity surrounded by a membrane? And the F-actin must be in the cortex of the cell since there is very little cytoplasm associated with the pseudopodial extensions that surround the spicule.</p></disp-quote><p>We change this sentence to: “The first step in generating the sea urchin spicules is the construction of the spicule cavity where the mineral is engulfed in a membrane coated with F-actin” (lines 403-404). Our observations show that F-actin is enriched around the spicule cavity. It could be an extension of the cell cortex, but we did not prove it, so we prefer to simply describe what we saw.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Line 405-408. Thank you for putting in this unknown. It is important to point out that while you've shown that ROCK contributes to regulation of actomyosin, it is not clear whether this is direct or indirect. You have also shown that ROCK somehow contributes to regulation of the GRN that leads to skeletogenesis. Thus, your data are consistent in showing that ROCK perturbation cripples normal skeletogenesis both via morpholino and with a selective inhibitor. Your last part of the discussion then offers speculation as to what might be affected specifically. That discussion sets the stage for digging even deeper to identify specific targets of ROCK activity.</p></disp-quote><p>Thank you, we agree with you that there is an exciting road ahead of us!</p></body></sub-article></article>
