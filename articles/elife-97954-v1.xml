implications for modern clinical practice. The hypnotic and sedative effects of midazolam afford it broad clinical applicability. However, the specific mechanisms underlying the modulation of altered consciousness by midazolam remain elusive. Herein, using pharmacology, optogenetics, chemogenetics, fiber photometry, and gene knockdown, this in vivo research revealed the role of locus coeruleus (LC)-ventrolateral preoptic nucleus noradrenergic neural circuit in regulating midazolam-induced altered consciousness. This effect was mediated by α1 adrenergic receptors. Moreover, gamma-aminobutyric acid receptor type A (GABAA-R) represents a mechanistically crucial binding site in the LC for midazolam. These findings will provide novel insights into the neural circuit mechanisms underlying the recovery of consciousness after midazolam administration and will help guide the timing of clinical dosing and propose effective intervention targets for timely recovery from midazolam-induced loss of consciousness.</p></abstract><kwd-group kwd-group-type="author-keywords"><kwd>C57BL/6J mice female</kwd><kwd>C57BL/6J mice male</kwd><kwd>GABAA-R knockdown C57BL/6J mice</kwd></kwd-group><kwd-group kwd-group-type="research-organism"><title>Research organism</title><kwd>Mouse</kwd></kwd-group><funding-group><award-group id="fund1"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100001809</institution-id><institution>National Natural Science Foundation of China</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>81771403</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Zhang</surname><given-names>HongHai</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund2"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100004731</institution-id><institution>Natural Science Foundation of Zhejiang Province</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>LZ20H090001</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Zhang</surname><given-names>HongHai</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund3"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100004731</institution-id><institution>Natural Science Foundation of Zhejiang Province</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>LHZY24H090003</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Shen</surname><given-names>Yue</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund4"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100001809</institution-id><institution>National Natural Science Foundation of China</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>81974205</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Zhang</surname><given-names>HongHai</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><funding-statement>The funders had no role in study design, data collection and interpretation, or the decision to submit the work for publication.</funding-statement></funding-group><custom-meta-group><custom-meta specific-use="meta-only"><meta-name>Author impact statement</meta-name><meta-value>The results of central nervous regulation in mice provide a new neural circuit and receptor regulatory mechanisms for the recovery of consciousness after midazolam administration.</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta specific-use="meta-only"><meta-name>publishing-route</meta-name><meta-value>prc</meta-value></custom-meta></custom-meta-group></article-meta></front><body><sec id="s1" sec-type="intro"><title>Introduction</title><p>Midazolam has been extensively utilized in clinical practice for nearly half a century. This benzodiazepine exhibits rapid onset and a short duration of action, and causes relatively mild hemodynamic effects (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Mandrioli et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Reves et al., 1985</xref>). It induces anterograde amnesia, thereby averting intraoperative awareness and mitigating the emergence of malignant memories in patients. The above characteristics of midazolam make it an indispensable drug for the treatment of psychiatric patients in the United States, China, Europe, and numerous other countries worldwide (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Conway et al., 2016</xref>).</p><p>Psychiatric disorders globally constitute a significant source of severe, long-term disability and socioeconomic strain. Among these,insomnia stands as a prevalent health issue in the general population and clinical settings (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Perlis et al., 2022</xref>). The World Health Organization reported that about 30% of the adult population worldwide suffer from insomnia, especially alongside other mental and physical health conditions (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib44">Sutton, 2021</xref>). Intractable insomnia frequently co-occurs with severe complications, including cognitive and immune decline, emotional disorders, and suicidal tendencies (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Buysse, 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Gebara et al., 2018</xref>). Oral benzodiazepines, exemplified by midazolam, constitute the foundation of their therapy regimen (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">Riemann et al., 2015</xref>). Furthermore, agitation, a prevalent clinical issue in numerous psychiatric disorders, significantly compounds morbidity during hospitalization (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Citrome, 2021</xref>). The extensively used medication for patients with acute agitation in the emergency department and intensive care unit is midazolam (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Kim et al., 2021</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">Shafer, 1998</xref>). In conclusion, midazolam has emerged as one of the most commonly administered psychotropic drugs in clinical practice, effectively inducing a sedative response with diminished consciousness.</p><p>However, a critical challenge in the clinical application of midazolam pertains to its safety profile. Depending on the dose, it produces effects ranging from anxiolysis to loss of consciousness, leading it to be versatile to have anxiolytic, sedative, and hypnotic effects (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Kanto, 1985</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Olkkola and Ahonen, 2008</xref>). Prolonged or excessive midazolam administration frequently results in increased sedation accumulation and depth, potentially causing delayed recovery, which in turn prolongs hospitalization and precipitates diverse complications (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">Shehabi et al., 2012</xref>). Consequently, it is imperative to investigate the mechanisms underlying midazolam-induced altered consciousness and find promising targets to prevent its complications.</p><p>Midazolam has depressant effects on the central nervous system (CNS). It is believed to act on the brainstem reticular formation and limbic system via gamma-aminobutyric acid receptor type A (GABAA-R), reducing brain excitability and inducing sedation. GABAA-R is the initiating molecular target of midazolam action. However, the specific mechanism governing the regulatory systems downstream of the GABAergic system in midazolam-induced alterations in consciousness remains to be elucidated. Midazolam elicits an electroencephalographic (EEG) pattern resembling normal non-rapid eye movement (NREM) sleep, lacking a sustained long-range-specific activation pattern compared to wakefulness (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Massimini et al., 2012</xref>). Therefore, we postulate that a midazolam-induced loss of consciousness, at least partially, involves the activation of an endogenous sleep-promoting pathway.</p><p>The locus coeruleus (LC) serves as the primary site for norepinephrine (NE) synthesis and release in the brain, exhibiting extensive projections to various other brain regions (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Benarroch, 2018</xref>). The LC<sup>NE</sup> neurons, which have been linked to multiple functions, including sleep and arousal, stress-related behaviors, attention, and pain conduction, are reportedly instrumental in sleep–arousal regulation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">Poe et al., 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib43">Suárez-Pereira et al., 2022</xref>). Optogenetic activation of LC<sup>NE</sup> neurons results in an instantaneous shift from sleep to wakefulness (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Carter et al., 2010</xref>). The ventrolateral preoptic nucleus (VLPO) in the preoptic hypothalamus is recognized as a pivotal ‘sleep center’ in which sleep-activated neurons orchestrate the initiation and promotion of sleep, and these neurons are subject to regulation by the LC<sup>NE</sup> neurons (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Chou et al., 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">Sherin et al., 1996</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib40">Sherin et al., 1998</xref>). Recently, it has been reported that optogenetic activation of the LC-VLPO NEergic neural circuit facilitates arousal from sleep, mediating its effect through distinct adrenergic receptors, indicating the significance of this neural circuit in controlling wakefulness (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Liang et al., 2021</xref>). However, natural sleep is a physiological state, whereas drug-induced loss of consciousness is a pathological state, and the two are quite different from a pathophysiological perspective despite some correlation. Furthermore, dexmedetomidine-induced sedation encompasses the utilization of the endogenous sleep-promoting pathway mediated by the LC-VLPO (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Nelson et al., 2003</xref>). Therefore, these studies offer hints for additional investigation into the role of LC-VLPO NEergic neural circuit in midazolam-induced alterations in consciousness. This will facilitate a more targeted clarification of the neural mechanisms underlying the sedative-hypnotic effects of midazolam, with profound clinical implications.</p><p>In the current study, it was unveiled that midazolam initially functioned by acting on GABAA-R in the LC. Crucially, we found that the LC-VLPO NEergic neural circuit plays an important role in promoting recovery from midazolam and that this effect was primarily mediated by α1 adrenergic receptors (α1-R). We took a cascading approach from peripheral to central to validate our hypothesis. Initially, we used pharmacological methods to investigate the link between the NE system and awakening from midazolam administration. Subsequently, we adopted more precise and targeted approaches, such as optogenetics and chemogenetics, to further substantiate our finding and successfully prove the involvement of the NEergic LC-VLPO neural circuit in facilitating the restoration of consciousness following midazolam administration. In addition, we employed both female and male mice in a series of chemogenetic activation experiments, suggesting that interventions that promoted rebooting from midazolam-induced unconsciousness in male mice were equally effective in female mice. In other words, our findings possess universal applicability and hold significant clinical application value. Based on the above experimental results, we further employed the knockdown technique to specifically manipulate GABAA-R on LC<sup>NE</sup> neurons. We found that knockdown GABAA-R not only reduced recovery time from midazolam but also affected calcium signals in NEergic terminals at VLPO. More importantly, specifically block α1-R at VLPO reversed the effect of shortened recovery time produced by GABAA-R knockdown on LC<sup>NE</sup> neurons.</p><p>These results will significantly enhance our understanding of the neural circuit mechanisms of midazolam-induced altered consciousness and provide a potential target for interventions aimed at addressing delayed recovery caused by midazolam.</p></sec><sec id="s2" sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><sec id="s2-1"><title>The noradrenergic system contributes to recovering from midazolam administration</title><p>Before starting the following experiments, we first determined the optimal intraperitoneal (IP) dose of midazolam-induced sedation (loss of consciousness).

However, we also found that compared with the control group, the NE content in the brainstem was significantly reduced after midazolam administration (p&lt;0.05, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1D</xref>).</p><p>Subsequently, we adopted a pharmacological method of peripheral intervention on NE. We found that IP injection of atomoxetine (20 mg/kg), a central selective NE reuptake inhibitor, increased the number of c-Fos (+)/TH (+) cells in the LC (p&lt;0.01, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1J and L</xref>) and shortened the recovery time from midazolam administration (p&lt;0.05, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1F</xref>). In contrast, IP injection of N-(2-chloroethyl)-N-ethyl-2-bromoben-zylamine hydrochloride (DSP-4) (50 mg/kg), a highly selective NEergic neurotoxin, reduced the number of TH+ cells in the LC, most significantly on day 10 after injection (p&lt;0.0001, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1I and K</xref>) and prolonged the recovery time from midazolam administration (p&lt;0.05, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1G</xref>).

Although the number of clinical studies addressing the effects of midazolam on consciousness as well as behavior is gradually increasing, the specific neural mechanisms by which it alters consciousness remain unclear. To fill this gap, we opted to investigate midazolam, a clinical drug, to study in mice to find a promising target for the development of an effective strategy to provide targeted therapies for the reversal of midazolam-induced delayed recovery.</p><p>In the current study, we employed a cascade approach, initially utilizing pharmacology and enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA), to validate that the central NE system plays an important role in recovery from midazolam sedation. We found that midazolam administration significantly reduced NE content in the brainstem, whereas IP injection of atomoxetine, an NE reuptake inhibitor, could shorten recovery time from midazolam. Conversely, peripheral injection of DSP-4 reverses the pro-recovery effect of atomoxetine. Second, based on calcium signaling, we found a decrease in LC<sup>NE</sup> neuronal activity after midazolam administration. Concordantly, optogenetic and chemogenetic activation of LC<sup>NE</sup> neurons could facilitate recovery from midazolam, whereas elective ablation of LC<sup>NE</sup> neurons by intra-LC microinjection of DSP-4 attenuates recovery. Third, we turned our attention to the downstream pathway of the LC. We found that optogenetic and chemogenetic activation of LC<sup>NE</sup> neurons could influence the activity of VLPO, and ChR2 can be transmitted from the LC to the VLPO across synapses, suggesting that the LC can project to the VLPO. Next, ICV injection of different adrenergic receptor agonists or antagonists suggested the main involvement of α1-R in the regulative effect of recovery from midazolam. Also, we microinjected α1-R antagonist into VLPO and found that the pro-arousal effect induced by activation of LC<sup>NE</sup> neurons was reversed, suggesting that α1-R in the VLPO is more responsive to regulate recovery from midazolam. Then, ICV injection of the GABAA-R antagonist gabazine or microinjection of gabazine into the LC shortened the recovery time from midazolam, and we found that antagonizing GABAA-R could inhibit the activity of LC, suggesting that GABAA-R in the LC may be an initiating target for the action of midazolam. Finally, by using pharmacological method and gene knockdown technique we found that GABAergic and NEergic systems co-regulated recovery from midazolam, and GABAA-R on LC<sup>NE</sup> neurons and NE α1-R on VLPO were the key points. More importantly, in this study, both male and female mice were used in all chemogenetic activation experiments, and we found that sex discrepancies did not affect the results of the experiment, which signified that the intervention that promoted rebooting from midazolam-induced unconsciousness was equally effective in both male and female mice. Our findings have a universal applicability as well as great clinical translational significance. For the dopamine-beta-hydroxylase (Dbh) promotor applied in the optogenetic and chemogenetic studies, as supported by the literature, Dbh, located in the inner membrane of noradrenergic and adrenergic neurons, is an enzyme that catalyzes the conversion of dopamine to NE, and therefore plays an important role in noradrenergic neurotransmission. Dbh is a marker of noradrenergic neurons. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib47">Zhou et al., 2020</xref> clarified the probe specifically labeled noradrenergic neurons by immunolabeling for Dbh. Recently, Dbh promoter has been used in several studies (e.g., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Han et al., 2024</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Lian et al., 2023</xref>). The Dbh-Cre mice are widely used to specifically labeled noradrenergic neurons (e.g., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Li et al., 2023</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Breton-Provencher et al., 2022</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Liu et al., 2024</xref>). It is difficult to distinguish the role of NE or DA neurons when using the Th promoter in VLPO. Therefore, we used Dbh promoter with more specific labeling. LC is the main noradrenergic nucleus of the central nervous system. In our study, we injected rAAV-Dbh-GCaMP6m-WPRE (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figures 2</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8">8</xref>) and rAAV-Dbh-EGFP-S'miR-30a-shRNA GABAA receptor–3’-miR30a-WPRES (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig9">Figure 9</xref>) into the LC. The results showed that Dbh promoter could specifically label noradrenergic neurons in the LC, while nonspecific markers outside the LC were almost absent.</p><p>Altered states of consciousness attributed to the action of sedative drugs on molecular targets in the CNS have been the focus of research over the past decades. GABAA-R is a well-recognized target of different sedative agents. GABAA-R is a ligand-gated Cl- channel that mediates the majority of the fast inhibitory neurotransmission in the CNS and has a crucial role in regulating brain excitability. The GABAA-R family comprises 19 subunit genes, including α1–6, β1–3, γ1–3, δ, ε, θ, π, and ρ1–3, which assemble to form a pentameric structure (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Ghit et al., 2021</xref>). The GABAA-R has a GABA-binding receptor site and some regulatory sites for binding of various substances, and the best characterized regulatory site is the benzodiazepine (BZ) one (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib41">Sigel and Ernst, 2018</xref>). Midazolam is a prevalent psychotropic substance that acts as a positive allosteric modulator of this receptor (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Olsen, 2018</xref>). The drug binds highly specifically to the BZ-binding site on the GABAA-R complex, modulating the affinity of GABA and GABA-binding receptor sites and reducing the excitability of the CNS, thus inducing sedation, hypnosis, and unconsciousness. Receptors containing the α1, 2, 3, 5, and γ2 subunit interface form the BZ-binding site of GABAA-R, suggesting the significance of these subunits in midazolam-mediated effects (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Maramai et al., 2020</xref>). Notably, β3-knockout mice exhibit a shorter duration of LORR in response to midazolam, suggesting a role of β3-containing GABAA-R in mediating midazolam-induced unconsciousness (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">Quinlan et al., 1998</xref>). According to our findings, midazolam modulates downstream neural pathways by initially acting on GABAA-R in the LC. It is future studies of membrane proteins and ion channels in LC or non-LC NEergic neurons that we call for to fully understand the molecular and neural circuit targets of sedative-hypnotics.</p><p>Midazolam elicits a de-consciousness state resembling natural sleep, likely involving endogenous sleep-arousal neural nuclei and circuits to induce hypnosis and loss of consciousness. In conjunction with past studies, midazolam and other sedative drugs act primarily by enhancing GABAergic inhibitory neurotransmission, implying a sleep-like facilitating effect of the GABAergic system. However, the mechanism of neural circuits downstream of GABA that regulate changes in consciousness remains elusive.</p><p>Arousal in the brain depends on many areas that can simultaneously receive diverse signals, with the ascending reticular activating system (ARAS) overseeing arousal and wakefulness maintenance (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Lee and Dan, 2012</xref>). LC<sup>NE</sup> neurons, which are an important component of the ARAS, reportedly play a key role in the maintenance of arousal and alertness (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Berridge et al., 2012</xref>). Specifically, we posit that LC<sup>NE</sup> neurons and their associated circuits are involved in modulating recovery from midazolam. In this study, LC<sup>NE</sup> neurons were activated by photostimulation and chemogenetics to rapidly induce the transition from unconsciousness to awakening. As a pivotal arousal center, the LC receives arousal-related inputs and extensively innervates the cerebral cortex and forebrain structures with NEergic projections (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Hayat et al., 2020</xref>). We initially pharmacologically validated the role of the central NEergic system in modulating midazolam recovery. Subsequently since the LC is the predominant nucleus in the brain for the release of NE, we further demonstrated the role of LC<sup>NE</sup> neurons in midazolam recovery through selective activation and degradation of them. Here, our study elucidates the critical role of NEergic neurons in the LC in midazolam recovery by pharmacology, optogenetics, and chemogenetics.</p><p>Given that the VLPO lies downstream of the LC and plays a crucial role in sleep-related information integration, we spotlighted the LC-VLPO neural circuit. The VLPO harbors diverse neuronal populations, including GABAergic and galaninergic neurons, which are recognized as sleep-active neurons (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Arrigoni and Fuller, 2022</xref>). Intriguingly, there is another cluster of glutamatergic neurons in the VLPO that promote arousal (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Chung et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib46">Vanini et al., 2020</xref>). A recent report showed that LC<sup>NE</sup> neurons synergistically facilitate arousal from sleep by simultaneously activating wake-active neurons and inhibiting sleep-active neurons in the VLPO. This regulation of the two types of neurons in the VLPO is mediated by distinct adrenergic receptors (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Liang et al., 2021</xref>). However, our study differs significantly. First, we demonstrate that LC may play an irreplaceable role in midazolam-induced loss of consciousness because atomoxetine is a reuptake inhibitor of widespread NE in the brain, but our selective disruption of LC rendered its effect lost. Second, our study pinpoints GABAA-R in the LC as a potential key target for midazolam’s effects. Third, we identified this α1 receptor as a necessary target through pharmacology and further validated it with more specific means. Finally, we found that intra-VLPO microinjection of the α1 receptor antagonist prazosin significantly reversed the pro-recovery effect of intra-LC microinjection of GABAA receptor antagonist or activation of LC<sup>NE</sup> neurons. Crucially, atomoxetine, a psychotropic drug for treating attention-deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD), is a promising candidate for translational research to prevent delayed recovery from midazolam abuse in patients with ADHD. Essentially, targeting the central α1-R, particularly in VLPO wake-active neurons, may yield rational therapeutic strategies to prevent delayed recovery. Notably, the VLPO in turn sends GABAergic inhibitory projections to various wake-promoting nuclei throughout the neuroaxis, including the LC (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">Saper et al., 2005</xref>). Studies indicate that the activated VLPO releases GABA to the LC, thus inducing NREM sleep, while NE released from the activated LC inhibits VLPO sleep-active neuron activity and promotes wakefulness (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Brown et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib45">Van Egroo et al., 2022</xref>). As such, a deeper exploration of the interactions between diverse VLPO neuronal populations and their specific connections with the LC is warranted in our study.</p><p>The translational implications of a study are indeed a crucial measure of its significance. Our current study has the potential to translate into guidance for the clinical use of midazolam and allow for reducing unwanted drug side effects. On the one hand, we have selected the clinical drug midazolam for animal experiments, which will help us develop useful drugs to treat midazolam-induced serious complications (e.g., delayed recovery, ventilator-associated pneumonia, and coma) in the future, thus further advancing clinical trials. It provides some hints for managing agitated patients with neuropsychiatric disorders. On the other hand, in addition to intravenous or intramuscular administration, midazolam can also be taken orally to treat insomnia, ameliorate anxiety, and treat seizures and status epilepticus (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Conway et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Nordt and Clark, 1997</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib42">Smith and Brown, 2017</xref>). Oral midazolam affects consciousness to a greater or lesser extent, and some suicidal patients have even suffered immediate death from massive doses of midazolam. Our study thus offers valuable insights for medication guidance in such cases.</p><p>In summary, our study demonstrates that, in mice, the LC-VLPO NEergic neural circuit contributes to the rapid modulation of altered consciousness induced by midazolam (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig10">Figure 10</xref>), which is essential to ameliorate the complications of its abuse. It will pinpoint the relevant regions involved in response to midazolam and provide a perspective to help elucidate the dynamic changes of neural circuits in the brain during altered consciousness. It suggests a promising new avenue of investigation for the targets of timely recovery from midazolam-induced loss of consciousness, thereby minimizing the risk of delayed recovery and associated complications.</p><fig id="fig10" position="float"><label>Figure 10.</label><caption><title>Summary of neural mechanism of rebooting the unconsciousness caused by midazolam.</title><p>By using pharmacology, optogenetics, chemogenetics, fiber photometry, and gene knockdown, we revealed the role of LC-VLPO noradrenergic neural circuit in regulating midazolam-induced altered consciousness.

All experiments were mainly performed between 9:00 and 16:00 (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="supp1">Supplementary file 1</xref>).</p></sec><sec id="s4-2"><title>Establishment of a mice model of midazolam administration</title><p>We randomly divided healthy C57BL/6J mice into four groups (n = 8). These mice were used to determine the IP dose of midazolam that would achieve the optimal depth without inhibiting respiration before starting the formal experiment. Finally, we identified the lowest effective dose that was 100% successful in inducing loss of consciousness in mice, that is, 60 mg/kg midazolam (H-19990027, Jiangsu Nhwa Pharmaceutical Co, Ltd), as the optimal dosage for IP administration in mice and used this dose in subsequent experiments.</p></sec><sec id="s4-3"><title>Evaluation of recovery time</title><p>Before the experiment, the bottom of the open box with no lid and air circulation was covered with cotton pads and an electric blanket was placed on the lower side of the open box, and the temperature in the open box was preheated for 10 min before the experiment to keep the temperature in the open box suitable and constant during the experiment. Eight-week-old C57BL/6J mice were placed in the open box for 30 min, and then placed in the open box again after IP injection of the appropriate dose of midazolam (60 mg/kg) to start the timer. At the same time, the open box was gently rotated every 15 s. When the mice were rotated to the dorsal recumbent position and could not be voluntarily turned over for more than 1 min, it was the LORR, that is, loss of consciousness from midazolam. Subsequently, the mice were placed in the dorsal recumbent position for continuous observation, and when the mice could autonomously return to the normal position from the dorsal recumbent position, they were considered RORR. The time from the onset of LORR to RORR was recorded as the recovery time of midazolam.</p></sec><sec id="s4-4"><title>ELISA</title><p>The tyrosine hydroxylase (TH) content and specific enzyme activity were measured in two groups of C57BL/6J mice (n = 6 per group), one group was given 60 mg/kg midazolam intraperitoneally and the other group was not. The whole brain was removed and sectioned, and then prosencephalon and brainstem tissue samples were collected separately, and TH levels in these tissues were measured using an ELISA kit according to the manufacturer’s instructions (YS-M195, YS-M195-1, ELISA Kit, Yan Sheng Biological Technology Co, Ltd, Shanghai, China). The optical density (OD) was measured at 450 nm and 630 nm using an ELISA microplate reader (SynergyMax M5, iD5, Molecular Devices, San Jose, CA) (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="supp1">Supplementary file 1</xref>).</p></sec><sec id="s4-5"><title>Stereotaxic surgery and virus microinjection surgery</title><p>Eight-week-old C57BL/6J mice were weighed and injected intraperitoneally with 30 mg/kg of pentobarbital and placed in the rearing cage for about 5–10 min. After complete anesthesia, the mice were fixed on a stereotactic apparatus (68018, RWD Life Sciences, Shenzhen, China) and the head hairs of the mice were shaved off with a razor. A heating pad was used to maintain the body temperature of mice at 37°C during the procedure and an ophthalmic ointment was applied to their eyes to avoid dryness. To expose the skull, the scalp was sterilized and a longitudinal incision was made. The periosteum was then removed with 3% hydrogen peroxide and the residue was rinsed with saline. After drilling holes in the skull, the virus was injected into the target site at a flow rate of 40 nL/min via an ultramicro pump (160494 F10E, WPI). We left the needle at the target site for 10 min after injection to allow for diffusion of the virus. To target the LC, the coordinates were AP: −5.41 mm; ML: ±0.9 mm; DV: −3.8 mm. To target the VLPO, the coordinates were AP: −0.01 mm; ML: ±0.65 mm; DV: −5.7 mm. To target the lateral ventricular, the coordinates were AP: −0.47 mm, ML: −1.00 mm, DV: −2.40 mm. According to the experimental needs, optical fibers or catheters were subsequently implanted in the corresponding location and secured with dental cement. After that, the incision was sutured and the mice were placed on a heating blanket to be transferred to a cage when the mice were awake (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="supp1">Supplementary file 1</xref>).</p></sec><sec id="s4-6"><title>Optogenetics</title><p>Three weeks before the experiment began, the LC or VLPO was microinjected with an optogenetic virus of 100 nL of a 1:3 volume mixture of mTh-Cre-AAV/Dbh-Cre and AAV-EF1a-DIO-hChR2(H134R)-eYFP (viral titer: 5.00 × 10<sup>12</sup> vg/mL, Brain VTA Technology Co, Ltd, Wuhan, China). One week before the experiment began, the LC or VLPO was implanted with optical fibers (FOC-W-1.25-200-0.37-3.0, Inper, Hangzhou, China). Th-hChR2 expression in the LC and VLPO was determined by immunohistochemistry after the completion of optogenetic experiments. The mice were intraperitoneally injected with midazolam, and 20 min later, they were given 465 nm blue light to activate neurons in the LC or VLPO. In this study, we used different parameters for optogenetic activation: 20 min/2 mW; 20 min/4 mW; 10 min/4 mW; and 20 min/4 mW. We finally identified 20 min/4 mW as the optimal optogenetic activation parameter and used it in the subsequent experiments.</p></sec><sec id="s4-7"><title>Chemogenetics</title><p>Three weeks before starting the experiment, chemogenetic viruses of 100 nL of a 1:3 volume mixture of mTh-Cre-AAV/Dbh-Cre and pAAV-EF1a-DIO-hM3D-mCherry (viral titer: 5.00 × 10<sup>12</sup> vg/mL, Brain VTA Technology Co, Ltd) were microinjected into the LC or VLPO, and Th-hM3Dq expression in the LC and VLPO was determined by immunohistochemistry after the completion of chemogenetic experiments. Clozapine-N-oxide (CNO) (HY-17366, MedChemExpress) was dissolved in saline, and the mice were intraperitoneally injected with CNO 20 min after intraperitoneally injected with midazolam to activate neurons using the chemogenetics approach. In this study, we tested two concentrations of CNO: 0.1 mg/kg and 0.2 mg/kg. We concluded that 0.2 mg/kg was the optimal concentration and used this concentration for the subsequent IP administration.</p></sec><sec id="s4-8"><title>Fiber photometry</title><p>We microinjected 100 nL of rAAV-DβH-GCaMP6m-WPRE-hGH pA (viral titer: 2.00 × 10<sup>12</sup> vg/mL, Brain VTA Technology Co, Ltd) into the LC or VLPO. Two weeks later, an optical fiber (FOC-W-1.25-200-0.37-3.0, Inper) was implanted in the same area located 0.05 mm above the virus injection point (AP: −5.41 mm; ML: ±0.9 mm; DV: −3.75 mm/AP: −0.01 mm; ML: ±0.65 mm; DV: −5.65 mm) and fixed in place with dental cement. Then, 3 weeks after viral expression and 1 week after fiber optic placement, the calcium activity of the target neurons was monitored. Fluorescence emissions were recorded using a fiber photometry system (Inper, C11946) using a 488 nm diode laser, and the mice were placed in a dark box to avoid the influence of natural light source on calcium signal recording and accessed to the computer recording software to record calcium signals. After the recording was completed, the results recorded by the optical fiber were read into the calcium signaling data analysis software. The calcium signalings were recorded 30 min before LORR when the mice were awake. Then, midazolam was injected intraperitoneally. After the RORR, the experiment was terminated after 10 min of optical fiber recording. In <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2</xref>, the time points for awake, midazolam injection, LORR and RORR in mice were respectively selected as time = 0, while in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4</xref>, RORR in mice was selected as time = 0. The selected traces lasting for 20 s were based on the length of a complete Ca<sup>2+</sup> signal. The calcium signal intensity was calculated as the value of ΔF/F = (F-F0)/F0.</p></sec><sec id="s4-9"><title>GABAA-R knockdown</title><p>We microinjected 80 nL of rAAV-Dbh-EGFP-S'miR-30a-shRNA (GABAA receptor)–3’-miR30a-WPRES (viral titer: 5E+12 vg/mL, Brain VTA Technology Co, Ltd) into the LC.

One hour before IP injection with midazolam, C57BL/6J mice received IP injection of atomoxetine (10 mg/kg or 20 mg/kg) or saline (vehicle). To evaluate the impact of peripheral injection of atomoxetine on the recovery time of midazolam, three trials were done for each group of mice (vehicle, 10 mg/kg, and 20 mg/kg), and the recovery time was recorded.</p><p>To further verify the effect of NE on the recovery time of midazolam, we used DSP-4 (C8417, Sigma-Aldrich), a selective neurotoxin that targets the LC NE system in the rodent brain and is used to disrupt nerve terminals and attenuate NE and NE transporter function in the LC-innervated brain regions. We divided the mice into four groups (vehicle + vehicle, vehicle + atomoxetine, DSP-4 [3 days] + atomoxetine, DSP-4 [10 days] + atomoxetine; n = 6 in each group). The specific experimental method followed was as follows. C57BL/6J mice received IP injection of DSP-4 (50 mg/kg) or saline (vehicle) 3 days before or 10 days before the IP injection of atomoxetine (20 mg/kg) or saline (vehicle).

the authors’ response to the original reviews.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p><bold>Reviewer 1：</bold></p><p>One major issue arises in Figure 4, the recording of VLPO Ca2+ activity. In Lines 211-215, they stated that they injected AAV2/9-DBH-GCaMP6m into the VLPO, while activating LC NE neurons. As they claimed in line 157, DBH is a specific promoter for NE neurons. This implies an attempt to label NE neurons in the VLPO, which is problematic because NE neurons are not present in the VLPO. This raises concerns about their viral infection strategy since Ca activity was observed in their photometry recording. This means that DBH promoter could randomly label some non-NE neurons. Is DBH promoter widely used? The authors should list references. Additionally, they should quantify the labeling efficiency of both DBH and TH-cre throughout the paper.</p></disp-quote><p>In Figure 5, we found that the VLPO received the noradrenergic projection from LC, indicating the recorded Ca2+ activity may come from the axon fibers corresponding to the projection. Similarly, Gunaydin et al. (2014) demonstrated that fiber photometry can be used to selectively record from neuronal projection.</p><p>We appreciate the reviewer's insightful suggestion to elaborate on the DBH promoter, we have now expanded our discussion to address the DBH (pg. 18): “DBH (Dopamine-beta-hydroxylase), located in the inner membrane of noradrenergic and adrenergic neurons, is an enzyme that catalyzes the conversion of dopamine to norepinephrine, and therefore plays an important role in noradrenergic neurotransmission. DBH is a marker of noradrenergic neurons. Zhou et al. (2020) clarified the probe specifically labeled noradrenergic neurons by immunolabeling for DBH. Recently, DBH promoter have been used in several studies (e.g., Han et al., 2024; Lian et al., 2023). The DBH-Cre mice are widely used to specifically labeled noradrenergic neurons (e.g., Li et al., 2023; Breton-Provencher et al., 2022; Liu et al., 2024). It is difficult to distinguish the role of NE or DA neurons when using the TH promoter in VLPO. Therefore, we used DBH promoter with more specific labeling. LC is the main noradrenergic nucleus of the central nervous system. In our study, we injected rAAV-DBH-GCaMP6m-WPRE (Figure 2 and 8) and rAAV-DBH-EGFP-S'miR-30a-shRNA GABAA receptor-3’-miR30a-WPRES (Figure 9) into the LC. The results showed that DBH promoter could specifically label noradrenergic neurons in the LC, while non-specific markers outside the LC were almost absent.”</p><p>As suggested, we have quantified the labeling efficiency of both DBH and TH-cre throughout the revised manuscript (Fig.2D; Fig.3D, N-O; Fig.4E-F, J, L; Fig.5E, L; Fig.6L, S, X; Fig.7G).</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>A similar issue arises with chemogenetic activation in Fig. 5 L-R, the authors used TH-cre and DIO-Gq virus to label VLPO neurons. Were they labelling VLPO NE or DA neurons for recording? The authors have to clarify this.</p></disp-quote><p>As previously addressed in response to Comment #1, we agree that it is difficult to distinguish the role of NE or DA neurons when using the TH promoter in the VLPO. Therefore, we injected the mixture of DBH-Cre-AAV and AAV-EF1a-DIO-hChR2(H134R)-eYFP/AAV-Ef1a-DIO-hM3Dq-mCherry viruses into bilateral LC and AAV-EF1a-DIO-hChR2(H134R)-eYFP/AAV-Ef1a-DIO-hM3Dq-mCherry virus into bilateral VLPO. Moreover, we quantified the labeling efficiency of DBH in the LC to demonstrate that this promoter can specifically label NE neurons (Fig. 5). Importantly, these corrections did not alter the outcomes of our results. Both photogenetic and chemogenetic activation of LC-NE terminals in the VLPO can effectively promote midazolam recovery (Fig. 5G, N).</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Another related question pertains to the specificity of LC NE downstream neurons in the VLPO. For example, do they preferentially modulate GABAergic or glutamatergic neurons?</p></disp-quote><p>Our study primarily aimed to explore the role of the LC-VLPO NEergic neural circuit in modulating midazolam recovery. We acknowledge that our evidence for the role of LC NE downstream neurons in the VLPO, derived from activation of LC-NE terminals and pharmacological intervention in the VLPO (Fig.5, Fig.6, Fig.8, Fig.9) is limited. Accordingly, we now present the VLPO’s role as a promising direction for future research in the limitation section of our revised manuscript: “This study shows that the LC-VLPO NEergic neural circuit plays an important role in modulating midazolam recovery. However, the specificity of LC NE downstream neurons in the VLPO is not explained in this paper, which is our next research direction, VLPO neurons and their downstream regulatory mechanisms may be involved in other nervous systems except the NE nervous system, and the deeper and more complex mechanisms need to be further investigated.”</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>In Figure 1A-D, in the measurement of the dosage-dependent effect of Mida in LORR, were they only performed one batch of testing? If more than one batch of mice were used, error bar should be presented in 1B. Also, the rationale of testing TH expression levels after Mid is not clear. Is TH expression level change related to NE activation specifically? If so, they should cite references.</p></disp-quote><p>As recommended, we have supplemented error bar and modified the graph of LORR’s rate in the revised manuscript. (Fig. 1A-B; Fig. 9G-H).</p><p>We agree that the use of TH as a marker of NE activation is controversial, so in the revised manuscript, we directly determined central norepinephrine content to reflect the change of NE activity after midazolam administration (Fig. 1D).</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Regarding the photometry recording of LC NE neurons during the entire process of midazolam injection in Fig. 2 and Fig. 4, it is unclear what time=0 stands for. If I understand correctly, the authors were comparing spontaneous activity during the four phases. Additionally, they only show traces lasting for 20s in Fig. 2F and Fig. 4L. How did the authors select data for analysis, and what criteria were used? The authors should also quantify the average Ca2+ activity and Ca2+ transient frequency during each stage instead of only quantifying Ca2+ peaks. In line 919, the legend for Figure 2D, they stated that it is the signal at the BLA; were they also recorded from the BLA?</p></disp-quote><p>In this study, we used optical fiber calcium signal recording, which is a fluorescence imaging based on changes in calcium. The fluorescence signal is usually divided into different segments according to the behavior, and the corresponding segments are orderly according to the specific behavior event as the time=0. The mean calcium fluorescence signal in the time window 1.5s or 1s before the event behavior is taken as the baseline fluorescence intensity (F0), and the difference between the fluorescence intensity of the occurrence of the behavior and the baseline fluorescence intensity is divided by the difference between the baseline fluorescence intensity and the offset value. That is, the value ΔF/F0 represents the change of calcium fluorescence intensity when the event occurs. The results of the analysis are commonly represented by two kinds of graphs, namely heat map and event-related peri-event plot (e.g., Cheng et al., 2022; Gan-Or et al., 2023; Wei et al., 2018). In Fig. 2, the time points for awake, midazolam injection, LORR and RORR in mice were respectively selected as time=0, while in Fig. 4, RORR in mice was selected as time=0. The selected traces lasting for 20s was based on the length of a complete Ca2+ signal. We have explained the Ca2+ recording experiment more specifically in the figure legends and methods sections of our revised manuscript.</p><p>To the BLA, we sincerely apologize for our carelessness, the signal we recorded were from the LC rather than the BLA. We have carefully checked and corrected similar problems in the revised manuscript.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p><bold>Reviewer 2：</bold></p><p>In figure legends, abbreviations in figure should be supplemented as much as possible.

The authors did not reveal the full mechanism of this but rather the relative contribution of NE system. Several conclusions in the text should be edited to take into account this starting from the title. I think the following examples are more appropriate: &quot;NE contribution to rebooting unconsciousness caused by midazolam' or 'NE contribution to reverse the sedation induced by midazolam'.</p></disp-quote><p>As suggested, we have moderated the assertions about the mechanism of sedation induced by midazolam in several conclusions starting from the title (Line 1,125,150,169,202,237,482), to present a more measured interpretation in the manuscript.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Line 178-179, the authors state 'these suggest that intranuclear ... suppresses recovery from midazolam administration'.

Current studies suggest that the neural network involved in the recovery of consciousness consists of the prefrontal cortex, basal forebrain, brain stem, hypothalamus and thalamus. The role of these regions in midazolam recovery remains to be further investigated. Therefore, we will apply more specific experimental methods to determine the importance of LC-VLPO NEergic neural circuit and related NE receptors in the midazolam recovery, and conduct further studies on other relevant brain neural regions, hoping to more fully elucidate the mechanism of midazolam recovery in the future”.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Line 274, the authors used 'inhibitory EEG activity'. what does it mean? a description of which rhythm-related power density is affected would be more objective.</p><p>Example of conclusion inflation: in line 477, the word 'contributes' is better than 'mediates' if the specificity issue is taken into account.</p></disp-quote><p>As suggested, we have improved our expression of words in our revised manuscript (pg. 13-14).</p><p>References</p><p>Gunaydin LA, Grosenick L, Finkelstein JC, et al.
