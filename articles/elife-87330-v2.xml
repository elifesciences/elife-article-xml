Nerve cells in <italic>Hydra</italic>, as in many cnidarian polyps, are organized in a nerve net extending throughout the body column. This nerve net is required for control of spontaneous behavior: elimination of nerve cells leads to polyps that do not move and are incapable of capturing and ingesting prey (Campbell, 1976). We have re-examined the structure of the <italic>Hydra</italic> nerve net by immunostaining fixed polyps with a novel antibody that stains all nerve cells in <italic>Hydra</italic>. Confocal imaging shows that there are two distinct nerve nets, one in the ectoderm and one in the endoderm, with the unexpected absence of nerve cells in the endoderm of the tentacles. The nerve nets in the ectoderm and endoderm do not contact each other. High-resolution TEM (transmission electron microscopy) and serial block face SEM (scanning electron microscopy) show that the nerve nets consist of bundles of parallel overlapping neurites. Results from transgenic lines show that neurite bundles include different neural circuits and hence that neurites in bundles require circuit-specific recognition. Nerve cell-specific innexins indicate that gap junctions can provide this specificity. The occurrence of bundles of neurites supports a model for continuous growth and differentiation of the nerve net by lateral addition of new nerve cells to the existing net. This model was confirmed by tracking newly differentiated nerve cells.</p></abstract><kwd-group kwd-group-type="author-keywords"><kwd><italic>Hydra</italic></kwd><kwd>nerve net</kwd><kwd>nerve bundles</kwd><kwd>innexin</kwd><kwd>gap junction</kwd></kwd-group><kwd-group kwd-group-type="research-organism"><title>Research organism</title><kwd>Other</kwd></kwd-group><funding-group><award-group id="fund1"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100010665</institution-id><institution>Marie Skłodowska-Curie Actions</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id award-id-type="doi">10.3030/847681</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Hobmayer</surname><given-names>Bert</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund2"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100001659</institution-id><institution>Deutsche Forschungsgemeinschaft</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>Ho1621/3</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Holstein</surname><given-names>Thomas W</given-names></name><name><surname>Hobmayer</surname><given-names>Bert</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund3"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100001659</institution-id><institution>Deutsche Forschungsgemeinschaft</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>SFB474/B1</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Holstein</surname><given-names>Thomas W</given-names></name><name><surname>Hobmayer</surname><given-names>Bert</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund4"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100001659</institution-id><institution>Deutsche Forschungsgemeinschaft</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>Ho1088/2</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Holstein</surname><given-names>Thomas W</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund5"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100001659</institution-id><institution>Deutsche Forschungsgemeinschaft</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>SFB 269/A5</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Holstein</surname><given-names>Thomas W</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund6"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100001659</institution-id><institution>Deutsche Forschungsgemeinschaft</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>SFB 488/A12</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Holstein</surname><given-names>Thomas W</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund7"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100001659</institution-id><institution>Deutsche Forschungsgemeinschaft</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>SFB 873/A1</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Holstein</surname><given-names>Thomas W</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><funding-statement>The funders had no role in study design, data collection and interpretation, or the decision to submit the work for publication.</funding-statement></funding-group><custom-meta-group><custom-meta specific-use="meta-only"><meta-name>Author impact statement</meta-name><meta-value>A novel pan-neuronal antibody has revealed the organization of the nerve net controlling all behavior in the simple cnidarian <italic>Hydra</italic>.</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta specific-use="meta-only"><meta-name>publishing-route</meta-name><meta-value>prc</meta-value></custom-meta></custom-meta-group></article-meta></front><body><sec id="s1" sec-type="intro"><title>Introduction</title><p>Nerve cells arose early in the evolution of multicellular animals to sense the environment and control the activity of downstream effector cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Anderson, 1990</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib44">Mackie, 1990</xref>). In non-bilaterians (cnidarians and ctenophores) nerve cells are organized in nerve nets, which are often associated with muscle processes and coordinate the behaviors that involve ectodermal and endodermal tissues (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib44">Mackie, 1990</xref>). In bilaterian metazoans, the number of nerve cells is commonly much higher than in cnidarians and ctenophores and – importantly – nerves are organized into a centralized nervous system with large ganglia (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Arendt et al., 2016</xref>). The relatively simple organization of nervous tissue in non-bilaterians offers the possibility of achieving a comprehensive understanding of the relationship between the architecture and activity of the nervous system and animal behavior (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Bosch et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Galliot et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib60">Watanabe et al., 2009</xref>).</p><p>With a nervous system consisting of only 500–2000 nerve cells, depending on animal size (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Bode et al., 1973</xref>), the freshwater cnidarian polyp <italic>Hydra</italic> is a particularly useful model organism for such investigations. Furthermore, there are only two types of nerve cells in <italic>Hydra</italic> based on morphology: ganglion cells and sensory cells, and there are no surrounding support cells, such as glial cells in bilaterians (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">David, 1973</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Epp and Tardent, 1978</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib62">Westfall, 1973</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib65">Westfall and Epp, 1985</xref>). Ganglion cells are bipolar or multipolar, but there is no evidence for a distinction between axons and dendrites. Sensory nerve cells, by comparison, are polarized, with a short neurite and sensory cilium at one pole and a longer neurite at the opposite pole. Sensory cells in the ectoderm extend a cilium to the surface of the epithelium to sense the external environment. Sensory cells in the endoderm extend a cilium into the gastric cavity. Recent scRNAseq results have refined these morphological classes to include three sensory and five ganglion nerve cell populations based on distinct transcriptomes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Cazet et al., 2023</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib53">Siebert et al., 2019</xref>).</p><p>Nerve cells in <italic>Hydra</italic> are organized in a nerve net, as first described in classic studies (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib50">Schneider, 1890</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Hadži, 1909</xref>), in which the nerves were visualized by methylene blue staining and tissue maceration. Although higher concentrations of nerve cells were found in the head and the foot, there was no evidence for ganglia or a ‘brain’. A more detailed description of the organization and formation of distinct subpopulations of nerve cells in the various body parts of <italic>Hydra</italic> polyps was achieved by using monoclonal antibodies that recognized unknown antigens and antibodies that recognized neuropeptides (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Dunne et al., 1985</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Grimmelikhuijzen, 1983</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Grimmelikhuijzen et al., 1996</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">Hobmayer et al., 1990b</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Hobmayer et al., 1990a</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib57">Technau and Holstein, 1996</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib70">Yaross et al., 1986</xref>). More recently, the use of in situ hybridization to detect the expression of neuropeptide genes and transgenic reporter lines using the promoters from neuropeptide genes has provided more understanding of the regionalization of the peptidergic part of <italic>Hydra</italic>’s nervous system (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">Hansen et al., 2000</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Grimmelikhuijzen et al., 1996</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib42">Koizumi et al., 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib47">Noro et al., 2019</xref>). However, all of these results lacked the resolution to describe the entire nerve net in detail and there is presently no clear understanding of the overall organization of cells in the nerve net or how the cells communicate with each other. Likewise, while extensive EM studies have provided high-resolution images of individual nerve cells, neurites, and synapses (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">Kinnamon and Westfall, 1981</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib40">Kinnamon and Westfall, 1982</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib62">Westfall, 1973</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib61">Westfall et al., 1971</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib64">Westfall et al., 1983</xref>), they could not reveal the overall organization of the nerve net.</p><p>The <italic>Hydra</italic> nerve net is unique in that it grows continuously. All <italic>Hydra</italic> tissues, including the nerve net, are newly formed every 2–3 weeks in well-fed animals (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Campbell, 1967</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">David and Campbell, 1972</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">David and Gierer, 1974</xref>). Since cell proliferation occurs exclusively in the body column, there is continuous displacement of cells from the body column toward the head and foot and loss of cells at the extremities. In the course of this growth and displacement, the nerve net expands by the addition of nerve cells, which arise by differentiation from interstitial stem cells in the body column. Head- and foot- specific nerve cells are also continually added to these differentiated tissues. For example, tentacle tissue is completely renewed in 4–5 days by displacement of epithelial tissue from the body column into the tentacles. Ectodermal epithelial cells at the base of a tentacle differentiate into battery cells with the incorporation of nematocytes and newly differentiated sensory nerve cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">Hobmayer et al., 1990b</xref>).</p><p>In the present experiments, we take advantage of a newly developed pan-neuronal antibody (PNab), which stains all nerve cells and nerve processes in fixed <italic>Hydra</italic> polyps. Antibody staining and confocal microscopy show that nerve cells in <italic>Hydra</italic> are organized as two separate nerve nets, one in the ectoderm and one in the endoderm. Transmission electron microscopy (TEM) and block face scanning electron microscopy (SEM) demonstrate that the two nerve nets consist of discrete bundles of overlapping nerve cell processes. The bundles include different nerve cell types and neural circuits. Cell type-specific expression of innexins and formation of gap junctions provides the necessary circuit specificity. Strikingly, these neurite bundles extend past nerve cell bodies and do not appear to terminate on them. These results suggest a novel model for growth of the nerve net based on the lateral addition of new nerve cells to the existing net. We confirmed this model by tracking the addition of newly differentiated nerve cells to the nerve net.</p></sec><sec id="s2" sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><sec id="s2-1"><title>A new peptide antibody stains the entire nerve net in <italic>Hydra</italic></title><p>A rabbit antibody made against the peptide sequence VTRNQQDQQENRFSNQ (see Materials and methods) stains the nerve net in <italic>Hydra</italic> (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1</xref>) and is referred to here as PNab. In order to determine whether PNab recognizes all nerve cells in <italic>Hydra</italic>, two sets of experiments were performed. First, we investigated transgenic strains of <italic>Hydra</italic>, which express NeonGreen or GFP in nerve cells. One transgenic strain uses the promoter of an alpha-tubulin gene driving expression of NeonGreen. This transgene has been demonstrated to be strongly expressed in all differentiated nerve cells in <italic>Hydra</italic>, and correspondingly the entire nervous system is brightly NeonGreen-positive (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib48">Primack et al., 2023</xref>). Fixed polyps of this strain were stained with PNab and transgenic NeonGreen-expressing nerve cells were scored for PNab staining (see Materials and methods).

Tentacle tissue is continuously renewed by differentiation of battery cells at the base of tentacles. Basal disk tissue is similarly renewed. Cells are lost by sloughing from the tips of the tentacles and the center of the basal disk. How new nerve cells are added to the nerve net was not known. The occurrence of bundles, however, suggests a simple way to add nerve cells to the net, by lateral association.

The results reveal two separate nerve nets, a net of interconnected nerve cells spread throughout the ectoderm and a second nerve net in the endoderm. There are no nerve cells in the endoderm of tentacles (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5</xref>) and very few in the endoderm of the basal disk (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6</xref>). No connections between the two nerve nets were found based on PNab staining of ectodermal and endodermal nerve cells in rings cut from the body column of four animals (see Results). This is in agreement with earlier TEM observations (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">Hufnagel and Kass-Simon, 1976</xref>). It also agrees with neural activity measurements showing no cross-correlation between firing patterns of the ectodermal CB and RP1 neural circuits and the endodermal RP2 neural circuit (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Dupre and Yuste, 2017</xref>).</p><p>In the ectoderm, nerve cell bodies and nerve cell processes are closely associated with muscle processes at the base of ectodermal epithelial cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4A and C</xref>). TEM images of cross-sections of the body column confirm the close association of nerve cells with muscle processes in the ectoderm (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig9">Figures 9</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig10">10</xref>). This close association is consistent with direct neural control of body column contractions (see below). The localization of the endodermal nerve net is quite different. Endodermal nerve cells and their processes are located in a diffuse band at some distance from the endodermal muscle processes (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4B, C</xref>; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig9">Figure 9D</xref>). Furthermore, the polygonal pattern of endodermal nerve cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2D</xref>) is completely different from the parallel array of endodermal muscle processes arranged circumferentially around the body column (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4B</xref>). Both results suggest that the endodermal nerve net is not directly involved in controlling the activity of endodermal muscle processes.</p><p>Recently, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Dupre and Yuste, 2017</xref>, described electrical activity in nerve cells in a transgenic strain of <italic>Hydra</italic> that expresses the calcium reporter GCaMP6s in nerve cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Dupre and Yuste, 2017</xref>). They identified three discrete non-overlapping populations of nerve cells based on activity profiles (CB, RP1, RP2). Cells in each population fired together and there was no overlap between the firing patterns. The RP2 population was located in the endoderm, while the RP1 and CB populations were located in the ectoderm. The activity of the CB network was directly correlated with rapid contraction of the body column. The activity of the RP1 and RP2 networks was associated with slower changes in behavior.</p><p>The RP2 population is identical with the endodermal nerve net identified by PNab staining (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2D</xref>; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4B</xref>). Moreover, there are no RP2 nerve cells in the tentacles, in agreement with the absence of endodermal nerve cells in the tentacles as assayed by PNab staining (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5</xref>). The observation that the RP2 nerve net is not associated with rapid changes in behavior is consistent with the limited contact between the endodermal nerve net and endodermal muscle processes (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figures 4B</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig9">9D</xref>). However, endodermal ganglion cells do strongly express several neuropeptides, e.g., GLWa (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Cazet et al., 2023</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib53">Siebert et al., 2019</xref>) and release of such neuropeptides could modulate contractile activity in endodermal muscle processes. In particular <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib55">Takahashi et al., 2003</xref>, have shown that GLWa induces slow contraction of the endoderm and consequently elongation of the body column (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib55">Takahashi et al., 2003</xref>).</p><p>The two ectodermal circuits (RP1 and CB) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Dupre and Yuste, 2017</xref>) correspond to the ectodermal nerve net identified by PNab staining (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figures 2C</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">4A</xref>). Although the nerve net in the ectoderm appears to be homogeneous, the results of scRNAseq experiments indicate that it consists of two populations of ganglion cells, which express distinct neuropeptides (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Cazet et al., 2023</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib53">Siebert et al., 2019</xref>). Ec1 and Ec1/5 express the neuropeptide Hym176 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib47">Noro et al., 2019</xref>) while Ec3 nerve cells express the neuropeptide GLWa.</p><p>To correlate neural activity with muscle activity, transgenic <italic>Hydra</italic> that express distinct calcium reporters in ectodermal and ectodermal epithelial cells were made (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib54">Szymanski and Yuste, 2019</xref>). This enabled detection of muscle activity in each epithelium during fast contraction of the body column initiated by CB nerve cells. The results showed that both ectodermal and endodermal epithelial cells responded simultaneously to activity of the CB circuit. Since there are no nerve cell connections between the ectoderm and the endoderm (see above), they postulated (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib59">Wang et al., 2023</xref>) that the ectodermal epitheliomuscle cells activate endodermal epitheliomuscle cells directly via gap junction connections across the mesoglea (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">Hand and Gobel, 1972</xref>). This conclusion is consistent with our findings. Nerve cells in the ectoderm are closely associated with ectodermal muscle processes (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figures 4A</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig9">9,</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig10">10</xref>) and TEM studies have described both chemical synapses and gap junctions between nerve cells and ectodermal muscle processes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib62">Westfall, 1973</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib61">Westfall et al., 1971</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib63">Westfall et al., 1980</xref>). By comparison, our results indicate that such contacts are rare in the endoderm (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figures 4B</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig9">9D</xref>) and there is no endodermal neural activity associated with the fast contraction of the body column (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Dupre and Yuste, 2017</xref>).</p></sec><sec id="s3-2"><title>The <italic>Hydra</italic> nerve nets consist of bundles of parallel nerve processes linked by circuit-specific gap junctions</title><p>Prior to the present results, it was not clear how the nerve net in <italic>Hydra</italic> is constructed.

The connections between nerve cells along the body column mainly consist of two or more neurites attaching laterally to form bundles in the ectoderm (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig9">Figure 9C</xref>). The EM images in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig9">Figures 9</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig10">10</xref> confirm that neurites in such bundles are closely associated and show in addition that neurites in bundles extend past neighboring nerve cell bodies. Furthermore, the images of the nerve net in transgenic Hym176B polyps (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig11">Figure 11</xref>) demonstrate that neurites in bundles in the ectoderm belong to two different neural circuits CB and RP1. Hence, nerve cell-specific connections are required to carry circuit-specific signals. Circuit-specific gap junctions between neurites in bundles (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig12">Figure 12A, B, and C</xref>) appear to provide the necessary specificity. Furthermore, this result is consistent with the observation of <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Dupre and Yuste, 2017</xref>, that nerve cells in the CB, RP1, and RP2 circuits fire simultaneously indicating that they are linked by gap junctions.</p><p>Earlier TEM studies have identified both chemical synapses and electrical synapses (gap junctions) between nerve cells and between nerve cells and epithelial cells in <italic>Hydra</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">Kinnamon and Westfall, 1981</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib40">Kinnamon and Westfall, 1982</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib61">Westfall et al., 1971</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib63">Westfall et al., 1980</xref>).

They are connected to the ganglion network at their basal ends and could induce signals affecting changes in endodermal muscle processes associated with digestion. Two such events occur following ingestion of prey. First endodermal muscle processes below the tentacle ring contract locally (‘neck formation’) while endodermal muscles in the body column relax (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Blanquet and Lenhoff, 1968</xref>). Together these events create a closed space in the gastric cavity for digestion of prey. After digestion is complete, slow contraction of endodermal muscle processes restores the normal columnar form of the body column.</p><p>Recent experiments of <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Giez et al., 2023a</xref>, have now shown that endodermal ganglion cells are responsible for this regulation. These N4 nerve cells fire in response to swelling of the body column, e.g., when a food pellet is present in the gut. Ablation of N4 nerve cells using the nitroreductase-metronidazole system (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Curado et al., 2007</xref>) prevents mouth opening and ejection of the food pellet, which leads to dramatic bursting of the gut. Expulsion of glass beads used as an artificial food pellet was also significantly delayed in N4 ablated animals. Hence, endodermal ganglion cells are involved in regulating mouth opening and the swelling of the body column. The latter is a slow process, which could be caused by diffuse release of neuronal signaling molecules affecting muscle tension in endodermal muscle cells.</p><p>During digestion, slow waves of radial contraction move along the oral/aboral axis mixing the contents of the gut (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib51">Shimizu et al., 2004</xref>). Both neck formation and radial contractions are absent or strongly reduced in nerve-free animals consistent with a role for the endodermal nerve net in regulating digestion. The complete absence of nerve cells in the endoderm of the tentacles (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5</xref>), which are not involved in digestion, is consistent with this conclusion.</p></sec><sec id="s3-5"><title>A model for continuous expansion of the nerve net in growing <italic>Hydra</italic> polyps</title><p><italic>Hydra</italic> polyps grow continuously, but maintain a nearly constant size.

One consequence of this model is that elongating neurites terminate at apparently unspecific positions along a pre-existing neurite track (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figures 7</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig10">10</xref>). A second consequence is that elongating neurites grow past neighboring nerve cell bodies (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig9">Figures 9A</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig10">10</xref>). Both features are supported by our results and suggest that the existing nerve net acts as a template for the addition of new nerve cells.</p><fig id="fig14" position="float"><label>Figure 14.</label><caption><title>Schematic diagram of nerve net growth by lateral association of newly differentiated nerve cells (blue) with the pre-existing nerve net (green and red).</title><p>Upper images: the base of tentacles; lower images: the middle of the body column.

As discussed above, this ratio can be maintained by continuous addition of new cells to the nerve net during growth. Similarly, in the ectoderm of the gastric region and the peduncle, the nearly constant ratio of nerve cells to epithelial cells can be maintained by addition of new cells to the existing nerve net.</p><p>The tentacles, hypostome, and basal disk, however, all contain increased numbers of nerve cells in the ectoderm (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6</xref>) compared to the body column tissue from which they arise by tissue displacement. This implies new nerve cell differentiation in these tissues. This new differentiation has been well documented in earlier experiments (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">David and Gierer, 1974</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Hager and David, 1997</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Hobmayer et al., 1990a</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">Hobmayer et al., 1990b</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib57">Technau and Holstein, 1996</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib68">Yaross and Bode, 1978a</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib69">Yaross and Bode, 1978b</xref>) and is presumably associated with additional sensory and motor activities in these tissues. Indeed, a fourth GCaMP6s activity pattern was identified in nerve cells at the base of tentacles (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Dupre and Yuste, 2017</xref>), which was associated with movement of the head (nodding). A specific population of sensory nerve cells (Nv1) was identified which are incorporated into the battery cell complex in the ectoderm of tentacles (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Hobmayer et al., 1990a</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">Hobmayer et al., 1990b</xref>). At the opposite end, in the lower peduncle, a population of nerve cells was identified, which express the <italic>innexin2</italic> gene (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib56">Takaku et al., 2014</xref>). Elimination of the activity of these gap junctions disrupted contractile activity of the body column. In all of these examples, it is possible to imagine that the lateral addition of new nerve cells to the existing nerve net (see <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig14">Figure 14</xref>) gives rise to local changes in neural activity.</p><p>Finally, the nerve net is not just modified by addition as described above, but also by deletion of nerve cells. As shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figures 5</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">6</xref>, there are no nerve cells in the endoderm of the tentacles, even though this tissue arises by displacement of body column tissue, which contains nerve cells in the endoderm. This implies that nerve cells in the endoderm are removed when endodermal tissue moves into tentacles. It appears likely that this occurs by apoptosis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Cikala et al., 1999</xref>), although this has not been observed directly. A similar process presumably removes nerve cells from endodermal tissue entering the basal disk. It also indicates a constant turnover of existing neuron-neuron and neuron-epithelial cell interactions. The molecules involved in the underlying feedback communication for these processes are currently unknown.</p></sec></sec><sec id="s4" sec-type="materials|methods"><title>Materials and methods</title><sec id="s4-1"><title>Animals</title><p><italic>Hydra</italic> strains were maintained in laboratory cultures and fed two to three times per week with <italic>Artemia</italic> nauplii. <italic>Hydra</italic> medium (HM) contains 1 mM NaCl, 1 mM CaCl<sub>2</sub>, 0.1 mM KCl, 0.1 mM MgSO<sub>4</sub>, 1 mM Tris (pH 7.6).

Specifically, the authors attempt to improve the resolution, which is lacking in the previous studies, yet to generate a comprehensive overview of the entire nervous system's spatial organization and to infer communication between cells. To this end, Keramidioti et al. use state-of-the-art imaging approaches, such as confocal microscopy combined with the use of transgenic animals, transmission electron microscopy, and block face scanning electron microscopy. The authors present three major observations: (i) A novel PNab antibody may be used to detect the entire nervous system of Hydra; (ii) Nerve cells in the ectoderm and in the endoderm are organized in two separate nerve nets, which do not interact; (iii) Both nerve nets are composed of bundles of overlapping nerve processes.</p><p>The manuscript addresses a long-standing and currently intensively studied question in developmental neurobiology biology - it attempts to reveal structural properties and principles that govern the function of the nervous systems in non-bilaterian animals. Hence, this study contributes to understanding the nervous system evolution trajectories. Therefore, the manuscript may represent interest to researchers interested in evolutionary and developmental neurobiology.</p><p>The manuscript reports a remarkably meticulous study and presents stunning imaging results.</p></body></sub-article><sub-article article-type="referee-report" id="sa2"><front-stub><article-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.87330.3.sa2</article-id><title-group><article-title>Reviewer #3 (Public Review):</article-title></title-group><contrib-group><contrib contrib-type="author"><anonymous/><role specific-use="referee">Reviewer</role></contrib></contrib-group></front-stub><body><p>In this paper by Keramidioti et al, the authors have characterized a polyclonal antibody from rabbit, which was raised against a peptide of the intracellular domain of the Hydra Cadherin. This antibody unexpectedly recognizes presumably all neurons in the Hydra polyp but the specificity of the antibody was not investigated. Regardless, the antibody can be used to visualize and study the nerve net under a variety of conditions. The authors find that the endodermal and ectodermal nerve net do not make any contacts through the mesoglea, in contrast to earlier assumptions and data. They show that ectodermal neurons make close contacts to the myoepithelial muscles, in contrast to the endodermal muscles. Furthermore, they show that tentacle endoderm surprisingly does not have any neurons. Finally, a very nice tool to visualize the connections between the neurons is the staining of mosaic nGreen transgenic lines. This showed that the neurites align in parallel forming bundles of neurites over longer stretches, in particular in the ectoderm, which offers a mechanism how new neurons are added laterally to the existing nerve net. This has important implications about the way the neurons might communicate with each other.</p><p>Taken together, this paper adds to our knowledge of the Hydra nerve net and provides a new experimental tool. Although most of the study is rather descriptive the pictures are of spectacular quality, providing fascinating new insights into the arrangement and topology of the nerve net.</p></body></sub-article><sub-article article-type="author-comment" id="sa3"><front-stub><article-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.87330.3.sa3</article-id><title-group><article-title>Author Response</article-title></title-group><contrib-group><contrib contrib-type="author"><name><surname>David</surname><given-names>Charles N</given-names></name><role specific-use="author">Author</role><aff><institution>Ludwig-Maximilians-Universitat Munchen</institution><addr-line><named-content content-type="city">Munich</named-content></addr-line><country>Germany</country></aff></contrib><contrib contrib-type="author"><name><surname>Keramidioti</surname><given-names>Athina</given-names></name><role specific-use="author">Author</role><aff><institution>Ludwig-Maximilians-Universitat Munchen</institution><addr-line><named-content content-type="city">Munich</named-content></addr-line><country>Germany</country></aff></contrib><contrib contrib-type="author"><name><surname>Schneid</surname><given-names>Sandra</given-names></name><role specific-use="author">Author</role><aff><institution>Ludwig-Maximilians-Universitat Munchen</institution><addr-line><named-content content-type="city">Munich</named-content></addr-line><country>Germany</country></aff></contrib><contrib contrib-type="author"><name><surname>Busse</surname><given-names>Christina</given-names></name><role specific-use="author">Author</role><aff><institution>Ludwig-Maximilians-Universitat Munchen</institution><addr-line><named-content content-type="city">Munich</named-content></addr-line><country>Germany</country></aff></contrib><contrib contrib-type="author"><name><surname>Cramer von Laue</surname><given-names>Christoph</given-names></name><role specific-use="author">Author</role><aff><institution>Heidelberg University</institution><addr-line><named-content content-type="city">Heidelberg</named-content></addr-line><country>Germany</country></aff></contrib><contrib contrib-type="author"><name><surname>Bertulat</surname><given-names>Bianca</given-names></name><role specific-use="author">Author</role><aff><institution>Heidelberg University</institution><addr-line><named-content content-type="city">Heidelberg</named-content></addr-line><country>Germany</country></aff></contrib><contrib contrib-type="author"><name><surname>Salvenmoser</surname><given-names>Willi</given-names></name><role specific-use="author">Author</role><aff><institution>University of Innsbruck</institution><addr-line><named-content content-type="city">Innsbruck</named-content></addr-line><country>Austria</country></aff></contrib><contrib contrib-type="author"><name><surname>Hess</surname><given-names>Martin</given-names></name><role specific-use="author">Author</role><aff><institution>Ludwig-Maximilians-Universitat Munchen</institution><addr-line><named-content content-type="city">Munich</named-content></addr-line><country>Germany</country></aff></contrib><contrib contrib-type="author"><name><surname>Alexandrova</surname><given-names>Olga</given-names></name><role specific-use="author">Author</role><aff><institution>Ludwig-Maximilians-Universitat Munchen</institution><addr-line><named-content content-type="city">Munich</named-content></addr-line><country>Germany</country></aff></contrib><contrib contrib-type="author"><name><surname>Glauber</surname><given-names>Kristine M</given-names></name><role specific-use="author">Author</role><aff><institution>University of California Irvine</institution><addr-line><named-content content-type="city">Irvine</named-content></addr-line><country>United States</country></aff></contrib><contrib contrib-type="author"><name><surname>Steele</surname><given-names>Rob</given-names></name><role specific-use="author">Author</role><aff><institution>University of California, Irvine</institution><addr-line><named-content content-type="city">Irvine</named-content></addr-line><country>United States</country></aff></contrib><contrib contrib-type="author"><name><surname>Hobmayer</surname><given-names>Bert</given-names></name><role specific-use="author">Author</role><aff><institution>University of Innsbruck</institution><addr-line><named-content content-type="city">Innsbruck</named-content></addr-line><country>Austria</country></aff></contrib><contrib contrib-type="author"><name><surname>Holstein</surname><given-names>Thomas W</given-names></name><role specific-use="author">Author</role><aff><institution>University of Heidelberg</institution><addr-line><named-content content-type="city">Heidelberg</named-content></addr-line><country>Germany</country></aff></contrib></contrib-group></front-stub><body><p>The following is the authors’ response to the original reviews.</p><p>Answers to reviewers’ comments</p><p>Peer Reviewers 2 and 3 criticized the name of the antibody – hvCADab - and the lack of proof that it recognized a classic cadherin. These criticisms were justified and in the intervening months the issue has been resolved. hvCADab does not recognize the cadherin protein, although it was made to an 18 amino acid sequence from the intracellular domain of the H. vulgaris cadherin protein. Newly available genome sequences from two other species, Hydra oligactis and Hydra viridissima, now show that the 18 amino acid antigen sequence is not present in these species.</p><p>Nonetheless, the nerve net in both species is strongly stained by the antibody. Hence we have renamed the antibody PNab (pan-neuronal antibody). The antigen is currently not known. Nevertheless the antibody is an excellent reagent for imaging the nerve net in Hydra.</p><p>We have revised the section on antibody preparation in Materials and Methods to state explicitly that PNab does not recognize classic cadherin. To support this conclusion we have added a sequence comparison (Suppl Fig 3) of the intracellular domains of classic cadherins from H. vulgaris, H. oligactis and H. viridissima, which show that the 18aa antigen sequence is only present in the H. vulgaris classic cadherin and not in the cadherin sequences from H. oligactis and H. viridissima. All three sequences have highly conserved p120/delta-catenin and beta-catenin binding domains. The sequence between these domains is highly variable and the 18aa antigen sequence used for antibody production is clearly not present in the H. oligactis and H. viridissima sequences.</p><p>Both reviewers also criticized our evidence for pan-neuronal staining as inadequate. Hence we have now included additional data. We have stained a transgenic strain expressing NeonGreen under the control of a pan-neuronal alpha-tubulin promoter (Primak et al 2023). 684/684 transgenic nerve cells were stained with PNab. We consider this convincing evidence, in addition to the evidence presented previously, that PNab stains all nerve cells in Hydra. The first paragraph of Results has been revised to include these data.</p><p>Reviewer 2 suggested moving gap junction/innexin data (Suppl Fig 3 and 4) from the Discussion to Results. These are indeed new results and we have followed this suggestion. Fig 12 (new) clearly shows gap junctions between neurites in bundles. It also shows that nerve cells in bundles express cell type specific innexins and hence can form cell type specific gap junctions. We have also added new images (Fig 11) of a transgenic Hym176B strain stained with PNab. These show that neurite bundles in the ectoderm contain neurites from different nerve cell types = neural circuits and hence that neurite links must be specific, e.g. gap junctions.</p><p>As suggested by Reviewer 2 we have now provided a 3D interactive version of the block face SEM reconstruction (Suppl Fig 4). This shows that connections between neurites in bundles consist of thin overlapping fingers rather than “conventional” terminal contacts. It also shows that the purple neurite and extends past the green nerve cell body and does not end on it.</p><p>Reviewer 2 suggested deleting discussion of possible functions for the endodermal nerve net (Discussion). We disagree with this suggestion. Our imaging results showed no connections between ectodermal and endodermal nerve nets. We also presented quantitative data for the absence of contact between the nerve nets in the gastric region. Consistent with our observations, Dupre and Yuste (2017) found no functional connection between the ectodermal and endodermal nerve nets based of neural activity measurements. Nevertheless, Giez et al (2023) in a recent preprint have described contact between specific endodermal and ectodermal nerve cells in the hypostome involved in the mouth opening response to glutathione. Both their observation and ours may be correct. The issue is not resolved. Hence we have included a discussion of possible functions for ectodermal and endodermal nerve nets. Importantly, our conclusions incorporate the difference in connectivity between muscle processes and nerve cells in the two nerve nets.</p><p>Specific comments / Recommendations</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p><bold>Reviewer 2</bold></p></disp-quote><p>Novelty: two preprints (Giez et al 2023) became available after the submission of our preprint.

The differentiating nerve cell in Fig 11B is indeed stained by PNab. We have adjusted the intensities of red and green channels to show this more clearly.</p><p>We consider the very clear black space between ectoderm and endoderm e.g. Fig 2B or Fig 4A to be an adequate marker for mesoglea. Use of an anti-mesoglea antibody would reduce the clarity of the image.</p><p>It is always possible to look at more parts of Hydra tissue for possible nerve connections between ectoderm/endoderm. Nevertheless we provide the first quantitative data on the lack of contacts between 133 nerve cells (57 ectodermal and 76 endodermal) in the body column. Such data has not been previously available. And the EM result (Westfall 1973) cited by the reviewer is anecdotal at best. In later serial sectioning results on the hypostome/tentacle region from the Westfall lab no mention is made of nerve connections between the ectoderm and the endoderm. However, based on the results in the cited preprints (Giez et al) a closer examination of the hypostome/tentacle region in particular is warranted.</p><p>To strengthen our conclusion that there are no contacts between the ectodermal and endodermal nerve nets, we now explicitly cite results from Dupre and Yuste (2017) on a calcium reporter strain demonstrating the absence of any crosscorrelation between the firing patterns of ectodermal RP1 network and the endodermal RP2 network. There was also no correlation between the activity of the second ectodermal nerve net CB and the endodermal RP2 network. These results demonstrate the absence of functional contacts between ectodermal and endodermal nerve nets.</p><p>The reviewer criticizes the absence of trans-mesoglea links between ectodermal and endodermal epithelial cells in our EM images, e.g. Fig 9A. We can assure the reviewer that such links are frequently observed, although not in the image we chose for Fig 9A. This image, however, clearly documents two neurite bundles next to ectodermal muscle fibers.</p><p>We agree with the reviewer that neurite bundles are an important discovery. And they raise the question of synaptic connections between neurites in bundles. Unfortunately, it is not possible to scan along the block face reconstruction (Fig 10) and count synapses. The resolution is not sufficient. Although scattered dense core vesicles (DCV) are observed in neurites, clustered DCV described by Westfall et al (1971) as synapses were not observed. We did, however, observe gap junctions between neurites in bundles (noted in Suppl Fig 3). These data have now been moved to the main body of the paper as Fig 12 together with the scRNAseq results on innexin gene expression in nerve cells. These results make it clear that neurites in bundles are connected via gap junctions and that these gap junctions are specific for neural circuits.</p><p>The reviewer suggests that neurite bundles are an artifact of their interaction with muscle processes at the base of epithelial cells. We disagree with this statement. Muscle processes are temporary structures. They are withdrawn and reformed during every epithelial cell division, which occur approximately every three days. Bundles are almost certainly more stable structures. Furthermore, neurite bundles in the endoderm are distant from endodermal muscle fibers (Fig 4B and Fig 9D) and their polygonal pattern (Fig 2D) is completely different from the circumferential bands of endodermal muscle fibers.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p><bold>Reviewer 3</bold></p></disp-quote><p>Specific comments and suggestions have been answered above.
