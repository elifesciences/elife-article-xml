fate during growth. A fascinating exception to this is Basidiomycete fungi, where the two haploid genomes remain separate in a dikaryon, retaining the option to fertilize subsequent monokaryons encountered. How the ensuing nuclear competition influences the balance of selection within and between individuals is largely unexplored. We test the consequences of the dikaryotic life cycle for mating success and mycelium-level fitness components. We assume a trade-off between mating fitness at the level of the haploid nucleus and fitness of the fungal mycelium. We show that the maintenance of fertilization potential by dikaryons leads to a higher proportion of fertilized monokaryons, but that the ensuing intradikaryon selection for increased nuclear mating fitness leads to reduced mycelium fitness relative to a diploid life cycle. However, this fitness reduction is lower compared to a hypothetical life cycle where dikaryons can also exchange nuclei. Prohibition of fusion between dikaryons therefore reduces the level of nuclear parasitism. The number of loci influencing fitness is an important determinant of the degree to which average mycelium-level fitness is reduced. The results of this study crucially hinge upon a trade-off between nucleus and mycelium-level fitness. We discuss the evidence for this assumption and the implications of an alternative that there is a positive relationship between nucleus and mycelium-level fitness.</p></abstract><kwd-group kwd-group-type="author-keywords"><kwd>simulation</kwd><kwd>basidiomycete</kwd><kwd>fungi</kwd></kwd-group><kwd-group kwd-group-type="research-organism"><title>Research organism</title><kwd>None</kwd></kwd-group><funding-group><award-group id="fund1"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100011019</institution-id><institution>National Research Development and Innovation Office</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>K140164</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Czárán</surname><given-names>Tamás L</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund2"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100003246</institution-id><institution>Nederlandse Organisatie voor Wetenschappelijk Onderzoek</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>ALGR.2017.010</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Auxier</surname><given-names>Benjamin</given-names></name><name><surname>Auxier</surname><given-names>Benjamin</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund3"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100003246</institution-id><institution>Nederlandse Organisatie voor Wetenschappelijk Onderzoek</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>NWO86514007</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Aanen</surname><given-names>Duur K</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><funding-statement>The funders had no role in study design, data collection and interpretation, or the decision to submit the work for publication.</funding-statement></funding-group><custom-meta-group><custom-meta specific-use="meta-only"><meta-name>Author impact statement</meta-name><meta-value>Fungi that produce mushrooms have a unique life cycle with two haploid nuclei, instead of a diploid nucleus, this allows additional matings and selection at the level of the nucleus, even with a fitness trade-off.</meta-value></custom-meta></custom-meta-group></article-meta></front><body><sec id="s1" sec-type="intro"><title>Introduction</title><p>Kin-selection theory shows that altruistic interactions between individuals, or between other replicating entities, can evolve between genetically related vehicles (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Hamilton, 1964</xref>). Examples are altruistic interactions between individuals in social insects, cooperation between clonally related mitochondria within eukaryotic cells, and between clonal cells of multicellular individuals (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Bourke, 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib50">Queller, 2000</xref>). In sharp contrast to social altruistic interactions, sexual interactions often are avoided among genetically related and promoted among genetically unrelated individuals, either via behavior in animals or via incompatibility systems in plants and fungi (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">Herron and Freeman, 2014</xref>). This difference in preferred relatedness creates a tension between sexual and social interactions. This is illustrated in parental conflict over resource allocation to offspring. In species where females can carry embryos from multiple males, paternal genomes compete to extract nutrients from a common uterus/ovary (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Haig, 1993</xref>). The competition between genetic elements, in this case paternal alleles from different embryos, inevitably leads to conflict with the mother over resource provisioning. Any paternal competitive trait expressed in the embryo provides the selective ground for modifiers of maternal origin to repress these competitive traits (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib54">Rice and Holland, 1997</xref>). This parent-of-origin conflict over maternal resource provisioning can be suppressed by mechanisms such as genomic imprinting.</p><p>Most sexually reproducing organisms have mechanisms to police competition among the unrelated genetic elements or to re-establish high genetic relatedness upon mating. For example, social insects typically are monogamous, meaning that social interactions occur among full siblings (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Boomsma, 2009</xref>). Clonal relatedness among organelles is maintained by uniparental transmission and a bottleneck during sexual reproduction (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Cosmides and Tooby, 1981</xref>). Also, multicellular organisms typically develop by clonal outgrowth of a fertilized egg, and thus the cells are genetically identical barring de novo mutations (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Buss, 1987</xref>). In diploids tension is reduced between the two gametic genomes that form the zygote, because cell fusion (plasmogamy) is immediately followed by nuclear fusion (karyogamy), aligning the fates of the two genomes until the next meiosis. Tension is reduced between the unrelated haploid genomes because the benefits of a competitive allele from one genome are shared equally with the other genome. However, Basidiomycetes, the fungal clade containing mushrooms, rusts, and smuts, provide an exception to this general principle.</p><p>In these fungi, the fusion of plasma membranes occurs between two multicellular gametes (monokaryons), but nuclear fusion is delayed until immediately prior to meiosis. The mated individual with two separated haploid nuclei, termed a dikaryon, is genetically similar to a diploid by having two copies of the nuclear genome per cell, although gene regulation may differ due to the compartmented genomes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Banuett, 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib58">Schuurs et al., 1998</xref>). The dikaryotic state differs from diploidy as the separate haploid nuclei retain the ability to fertilize further monokaryons (reviewed in <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib52">Raper, 1966</xref>). A consequence of this delayed karyogamy in Basidiomycetes is an increase in mating opportunities (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Anderson and Kohn, 2007</xref>). Since the fertilization of a monokaryon is not associated with resource investment in the resulting new dikaryon, the dikaryotic life cycle corresponds to the retention of the male role (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Aanen et al., 2004</xref>). This unique form of mating between a dikaryon and monokaryon is known as di-mon mating, often called Buller mating (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Buller, 1934</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib51">Quintanilha, 1938</xref>). Di-mon mating, clearly impossible for a diploid organism, has been thought to be the main benefit of the dikaryotic lifestyle (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib52">Raper, 1966</xref> p.264). The exchange of nuclei between dikaryons is thought to be prevented in nature since fusion of two dikaryons triggers nonself recognition followed by apoptosis, quickly killing the fused cell (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Auxier et al., 2021b</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Aylmore and Todd, 1986</xref>). The prolonged mating opportunities of the dikaryon allow a nuclear genotype increased access to resources, as it retains its share of resources in the original dikaryon, and gains access to additional resources of the newly fertilized dikaryon. However, the benefits to a nucleus of this delayed karyogamy may carry a cost due to persistent tension in social interactions between the unrelated nuclei.</p><p>These di-mon matings present a competitive arena for the paired nuclei. Due to the high number of mating types in Basidiomycetes, both nuclei of a dikaryon are generally capable of fertilizing an unrelated monokaryon. This results in competition between the nuclei, the dynamics of which are poorly understood. Initially both nuclei appear to invade hyphae of the monokaryon, but ultimately only one of the two dikaryotic nuclear haplotypes fertilizes the entire monokaryon (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Anderson and Kohn, 2007</xref>). Competitive success within the dikaryon could be based on variation in rates of nuclear division, migration, or percentage of hyphae colonized (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Anderson and Kohn, 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib52">Raper, 1966</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib60">Vreeburg et al., 2016</xref>). Evidence of variation for mating success has been found in natural systems, where replicate di-mon matings consistently result in the same fertilizing nucleus (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Ellingboe and Raper, 1962</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib43">Nieuwenhuis et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib48">Nogami et al., 2002</xref>). In one study, the direct interaction between competing nuclei was found to determine success in a Buller mating, with a hierarchy of mating competitiveness (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib48">Nogami et al., 2002</xref>). However, there is also evidence that the interaction of the different nuclei with the receiving monokaryon determines mating success in a Buller mating (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib43">Nieuwenhuis et al., 2011</xref>). Whether this intraspecific variation in mating success will affect a population depends on the frequency of di-mon matings as well as simultaneous mon-mon matings. However, since mating success is difficult to quantify, the magnitude of this variation remains unknown. Alternatively, variation in nuclear competitiveness could be maintained due to trade-offs with mycelium-level fitness components.</p><p>Two common measures of fungal fitness are somatic (mycelial) growth and spore production (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib49">Pringle and Taylor, 2002</xref>). While these undoubtedly capture only a fraction of actual fitness variation between individuals, fitness components related to aspects like enzymatic variation have not yet been described (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Allison et al., 2018</xref>). For these sessile organisms, vegetative growth is required to explore nearby resources, and spore production is needed for dispersal to new sites. It has been thought that fungal vegetative growth and spore production may be under a life history trade-off (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib57">Schoustra and Punzalan, 2012</xref>; but see <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Anderson et al., 2019</xref>). Such a trade-off assumes that high vegetative growth rate to explore resources comes at the expense of either rapid or abundant spore production (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Gilchrist et al., 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib49">Pringle and Taylor, 2002</xref>).</p><p>Here we explore the consequences of di-mon matings in the dikaryotic life cycle for the proportion of fertilized monokaryons and for mycelium-level fitness components, assuming a three-way trade-off between growth, spore production, and mating success. We simulated the outcome for three life cycles: diploid, standard dikaryon (with di-mon matings) with retention of the male role, and a hypothetical open dikaryon with retention of the male and female role (similar to a life cycle without nonself recognition between dikaryons). While this open dikaryon is not known from nature, we explore potential consequences of such a dikaryon for the balance between selection among nuclei within mycelia and among mycelia. The unique life cycle of the standard dikaryon allows for additional matings through di-mon matings, but may come with the cost of selection at the level of the nucleus (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">James, 2015</xref>). Our results show that the frequency of unmated monokaryons is reduced in the standard dikaryon life cycle, but selection at the level of the nucleus reduces average dikaryon mycelium-level fitness. However, this cost is greatly reduced compared to a hypothetical life cycle where exchange between dikaryons is also allowed. Our simulations also show that these costs are increased if the loci associated with mating fitness are spread throughout the genome.</p></sec><sec id="s2" sec-type="materials|methods"><title>Materials and methods</title><sec id="s2-1"><title>The model</title><sec id="s2-1-1"><title>The arena</title><p>The ‘substrate’ on which the simulated mycelia live is two-dimensional, represented by a square lattice each site supporting a single mycelium, or section thereof.

To this end, we competed mixtures with varying starting proportions of nuclei with and without DMF. We simulated DMF as a dominant, co-dominant (each nucleus acting independently), or recessive trait with the fitness trade-off as either a mono- or polygenic trait. As seen in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4</xref>, in most cases when DMF is allowed, it increases in frequency (rows 1 and 3), but with different outcomes between the two nuclear positions. With a polygenic fitness trade-off, the DMF allele frequency increases, particularly in the male nucleus. When the fitness trade-off is monogenic, the DMF allele still increases in the male nucleus, except when DMF is recessive, but the population size remains large. Interestingly, in this monogenic scenario, the initial increase in population size is delayed due to increasing mating fitness, in the female role to the detriment of reproductive or vegetative fitness components, in effect becoming parasitic nuclei. These nuclei are purged with the first 250 generations regardless of the starting proportion. This purging of high mating fitness genotypes in the female role is less effective in the recessive case, as deleterious alleles are hidden from selection at low frequencies.

Similarly, increasing spore production had a mild affect, with increased proportion of nuclei maximizing mating fitness when linkage was 0.95.</p><p>Increasing the growth rate also decreased the nuclei maximizing mating fitness generally, particularly with values of g greater than 0.5. Particularly with the highest linkage values this decrease was more quantitative, with a similar number of nuclei being selected for mating fitness but instead resulting in less specialization. Increasing the dominance, especially above 0.5, resulted in increasing proportion of mating fitness specialists, particularly with higher linkage. To investigate the role of habitat fragmentation, we also experimented with splitting the grid into square patches of sizes from 2 × 2 up to 5 × 5, separated by strips of uninhabitable area (data not shown). Spores were capable of crossing this uninhabitable area, but mycelia could not grow across. This structured landscape resulted in increased variation between simulations, but we did not find qualitatively different results in the presence of nuclei maximizing mating fitness (data not shown).</p></sec></sec><sec id="s4" sec-type="discussion"><title>Discussion</title><p>The balance of evolutionary forces acting upon this unique dikaryotic life history has been unclear. Here we assess the impact of different levels of selection, nuclear, and mycelial, on the dikaryotic life cycle. The benefits of increased mating opportunities for a nucleus in a dikaryon seem obvious but the potential costs are perhaps less clear. Importantly, the dikaryotic state results in an increased proportion of individuals capable of sexual reproduction, particularly the male role, in the population compared to a diploid, due to the increased mating opportunities. As monokaryons generally have no reproductive output in Basidiomycetes, the resources they control (e.g. a section of a tree stump, or ectomycorrhizal tree roots) represent an opportunity for nuclei from dikaryotic mycelial neighbors. Since the nuclei within a dikaryon have low genetic relatedness, competition between them for these additional mating partners provides a tension, potentially resulting in genomic conflict. Our results show that even in the face of an imposed fitness trade-off at the organismal level, a dikaryotic life cycle will still select for mating success. Our results further show that the environment influences the costs and benefits of this dikaryotic life cycle as the density of individuals influences both the importance of mycelial level fitness and the chances for repeated matings. Our experiments with splitting the grid into patches indicates that our results are robust to some degree of spatial heterogeneity. However, extreme distribution patterns of suitable growth conditions could lead to genetic differentiation between patches, favoring selection between patches for mycelial fitness components.</p><p>A clear result of our simulations is the strong drive for mating fitness in the standard and open dikaryon. Under all tested scenarios and parameters, the selection for mating fitness resulted in most nuclei specializing in mating fitness. Depending on the parameters, this even resulted in population collapse. The selection benefit of di-mon mating was particularly visible when individual nuclei with and without DMF are competed directly. The DMF allele spreads through the population, even though it comes with the trade-off, regardless of the shape. This is because the adjacent monokaryons provide a reliable route for gene copy increase of the genotypes with the DMF allele. The marginal decrease in fitness from vegetative growth/spore production, due to the imposed trade-off, is outweighed by the benefit of additional matings. This drive for mating fitness is even stronger in the open dikaryon, leading to population collapse under a wider range of parameter settings than the standard dikaryon. It is important to note that the diploid scenario also selects for increased mating fitness, although with less strength, as matings between monokaryons can also include multiple partners with differing mating fitness, which has been shown in yeast to strongly select for mating pheromone production (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib55">Rogers and Greig, 2009</xref>). The fitness decrease at the dikaryotic level was dependant on the dominant/recessive nature of fitness components. While we did not test overdominant scenarios, the specialization of genomes leading to vigorous hybrid dikaryons, we do not expect it would qualitatively change the results, but would lead to increased mating fitness as even less residual vegetative or spore production fitness would be required for sustained population growth.</p><p>Our simulations also indicate that the nature of fitness inheritance has a strong effect on any deleterious effects of nuclear selection. When offspring are similar to parents due to linkage of fitness components, intermediate (i.e. nonparental) offspring are restricted to those produced by mutation. The meiotic progeny is differentiated into two types, producing either competitive or noncompetitive gametes. However, when fitness components are unlinked across multiple loci, matings result in gametes with competitive alleles at on average half of the loci segregating between the parents, resulting in very low phenotypic variance among offspring, resulting in uniform specialization for mating fitness. While our simulations used a blending inheritance model, this has been shown not to have a large effect on resulting social interactions when compared to biologically realistic Mendelian particulate inheritance (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Gardner, 2011</xref>). The fact that our simulations compared fitnesses of parents to determine the fitness of offspring, in the absence of a genetic model, makes this work similar to the ‘phenotypic gambit’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Grafen, 1984</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Grafen, 2014</xref>). Although future work would likely benefit from a more explicit genetic determinism, such phenotypic gambits are often useful as a first approximation to clarify future hypotheses (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Grafen, 2014</xref>). Of potential interest, backcrossing of wild isolates has shown that variation in mating success potentially resides near/within the mating-type locus (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib48">Nogami et al., 2002</xref>). In general, Basidiomycete mating-type loci are idiomorphic (highly polymorphic alleles) and have suppressed recombination, spanning from a general 50–150 Kb up to several Mb (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Branco et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Brown and Casselton, 2001</xref>). Future studies should investigate if alleles conferring mating success truly reside inside or near the mating locus, and if so, this is correlated with growth and/or reproduction. If increased mating fitness was negatively correlated with other growth characteristics, similar to the simulations here, such ‘parasitic’ mating-types alleles could be stable in a population since the trade-offs between reduced growth and increased mating success would be linked within a single nonrecombining locus.</p><p>A key assumption in our model is the trade-off between fitness components. While we do not specify the underlying nature of the trade-off, our assumption is consistent with antagonistic pleiotropy of the genes involved (i.e. an allele can be optimized for either fitness component but not all). This may seem a strong assumption. However, even without antagonistic pleiotropy, trade-offs are likely (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Garland, 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib40">Matthewson and Weisberg, 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib59">Stearns, 1989</xref>) particularly if selection occurs at multiple levels (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Booth, 2022</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">Lewontin, 1970</xref>). Increased selection at the level of the nucleus may also allow accumulation of mutations deleterious for dikaryon fitness, resulting in a trade-off. An experimental evolution study attempting to select for competitive nuclei failed to find a trade-off with mycelium-level fitness components (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib46">Nieuwenhuis et al., 2018</xref>). However, in this experiment simultaneous selection for multiple fitness components could not be excluded. Supporting the presence of a cost for nuclear selection, modifying our trade-off with nonlinearity resulted in population decreases proportional to the nonlinearity. This shows that the shape of the fitness trade-off has a quantitative, but not qualitative effect on selection for mating success. Importantly, nuclei capable of DMF are selected for, even when the fitness trade-off is strongly nonlinear, leading to a strong cost of mating fitness. In a population of diploid individuals, an allele conferring DMF has increased fitness despite the associated trade-offs.</p><p>The relationship between the different fitness components of dikaryons requires further study. Our model crucially assumes that the competitive success of nuclei during di-mon matings is the result of competition between the two nuclei in the dikaryon. Alternatively, the interaction between a nuclear type and the receiving monokaryon may affect the outcome of nuclear competition, effectively a form of female choice by the receiving monokaryon (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">James, 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">Kües, 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib43">Nieuwenhuis et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib44">Nieuwenhuis and Aanen, 2012</xref>). The B locus, one of the two loci determining the mating type of tetrapolar species, encodes both pheromones and pheromone receptors. While a single pheromone-receptor interaction is sufficient for sexual compatibility, typically there is high redundancy in the number of compatible pheromone-receptor interactions, with an excess of compatible pheromones (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">Kües, 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib44">Nieuwenhuis and Aanen, 2012</xref>). It has been argued that this redundancy is a consequence of female choice, and that pheromones may function as an honest signal of nuclear quality (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">James, 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib55">Rogers and Greig, 2009</xref>). If female choice is important, a trade-off between nuclear- and mycelial-level fitness components may not be expected, but instead a positive relationship due to the ‘good genes’ model (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib62">Zahavi, 1975</xref>). Under this model of female choice, nuclear competition could instead have positive effects on mycelial fitness. However, the exact consequences of different assumptions on the relationship between fitness components should be modeled.</p><p>While it is often assumed that in fungi the mycelial individual (whether monokaryon or dikaryon) is the unit of selection, in multinucleate fungi this is not the only level (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Booth, 2022</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">Lewontin, 1970</xref>). Our model shows an example of how selection at the level of the nucleus, from competition between unrelated nuclei for mating, occurs despite being detrimental to the level of the dikaryon. Nuclear selection has been shown to act rapidly in hyphal fungi, where cheater nuclei can be selected in experimental evolution (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Bastiaans et al., 2016</xref>), but also in natural isolates of a dikaryotic ascomycete, <italic>Neurospora tetrasperma</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib41">Meunier et al., 2018</xref>). An important factor in dikaryotic fitness considerations is the level of phenotypic dominance, which can mask deleterious mutations. The prevalence of dominant phenotypes in Basidiomycetes is currently unknown, although recent work has found little support for dominant-recessive relationships (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Clergeot et al., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">Hiscox et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib47">Nobre et al., 2014</xref>).</p><p>The idea of nuclear selection was not initially connected with fitness trade-offs, instead predicting ever increasing sexual fitness as a result of internuclear competition (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib52">Raper, 1966</xref>). A recent reappraisal of internuclear competition phrased it as the ‘selfish nucleus model’, imagining a scenario where mating fitness could select for nuclei detrimental to the dikaryon, similar to our simulation design (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">James et al., 2009</xref>). Our results, with open dikaryons resulting in detrimental levels of nuclear selection, are consistent with the intuition of <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">James et al., 2009</xref>, who postulated the occurrence matings between dikaryons ‘<italic>provided the negative effects of nuclear competition are not also increased</italic>’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">James et al., 2009</xref>). Our simulations show that if such negative effects of nuclear competition exist, then open dikaryons will suffer from reduced fitness. Therefore, it is crucial to establish the relationship between nuclear competitiveness in di-mon interactions, and the fitness of the resulting dikaryon. As mentioned above, an alternative model is that the interaction between fertilizing nuclei and receiving monokaryon determines nuclear competitive success, which would be a form of female choice based on gamete testing.</p><p>Nuclear exchange between dikaryons, di-di matings in our simulations, has been demonstrated in natural settings (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Hansen et al., 1993</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">Johannesson and Stenlid, 2004</xref>). However, we would argue this is not equivalent to an open dikaryon. These examples of nuclear exchange between dikaryons are documented in <italic>Heterobasidion</italic> species<italic>,</italic> a common Basidiomycete study system, but one in which dikaryons develop abundant monokaryotic hyphal sectors (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">Johannesson and Stenlid, 2004</xref>). Presumably the observed nuclear exchange between dikaryons occurs through monokaryotic hyphal intermediates. This inclusion of monokaryotic hyphal intermediates makes this more similar to either di-mon or mon-mon mating, depending on how the monokaryotic sections are fertilized. Crucially, there is a qualitative difference between di-di and di-mon matings through monokaryotic intermediates, as novel dikaryons from the latter will be somatically incompatible with the two established dikaryotic progenitors, having no spatial access to further resources (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">Johannesson and Stenlid, 2004</xref>). Such segregation into monokaryotic hyphae with subsequent mating would be compatible with the model recently suggested as ‘somatic hybridization’ in rust fungi (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">Li et al., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib42">Nelson et al., 1955</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib61">Wu et al., 2019</xref>). These apparent di-di matings may not experience the same evolutionary forces as if true di-di matings were allowed, due to the physical restriction of the novel dikaryons.</p><p>Our simulations aimed to understand the potential consequences of nuclear selection in mushroom-forming Basidiomycetes but may also have relevance for other fungal groups. The widespread plant pathogenic rust fungi also have a dikaryotic stage. Nuclear exchange between these rust dikaryons is also reported, ‘somatic hybridization’, in the production of novel pathogenic rust races (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Burdon et al., 1981</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">Li et al., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib42">Nelson et al., 1955</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib61">Wu et al., 2019</xref>). It is difficult to reconcile the occurrence of somatic hybridization with our results showing that open dikaryons are highly susceptible to nuclear selection. One possibility is that somatic hybridization is exceedingly rare, as a single somatic hybridization event could produce a rust race able to grow on otherwise resistant hosts. Another possibility would be monokaryotic intermediate hyphae, similar to that in <italic>Heterobasidion</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Hansen et al., 1993</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">Johannesson and Stenlid, 2004</xref>). Also, recent evidence indicates that the abundant Arbuscular Mycorrhizal fungi from the phylum Mucoromycota also exist in a dikaryotic state (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib56">Ropars et al., 2016</xref>). While hyphal fusion occurs in this lineage (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Croll et al., 2009</xref>), the potential for di-mon, or even di-di matings, remains unknown.</p><p>The open dikaryon of our model corresponds to the ‘unit mycelium‘ concept formulated to explain observations of cell fusions in cultured fungal material (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Buller, 1934</xref>). This ‘unit mycelium’ concept was the working paradigm over many decades, with its assumption of cooperation between genetically unrelated individuals. However, accumulating evidence from natural isolates, showing that neighboring dikaryotic mycelia were instead distinct, led to the influential synthesis of the ‘individualistic mycelium’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib53">Rayner, 1991</xref>). This model of distinct individuals separated by allorecognition responses was consistent with the observation of somatic incompatibility between dikaryons, with fusions between nonself individuals leading to cell death, not cooperation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Booth, 2022</xref>). The ‘individualistic mycelium’ model is not only consistent with experimental evidence but also compatible with predictions that cooperation between nonrelated dikaryons to be exploited almost immediately (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Czárán et al., 2014</xref>).</p><p>This persistent dikaryotic state has been retained for over 400 million years (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Chang et al., 2015</xref>), yet few extant Basidiomycete species are diploid (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Anderson and Kohn, 2007</xref>). The retention of the dikaryotic state in the vast majority of Basidomycetes leaves open the potential for mycelium-level fitness costs of nuclear selection due to di-mon matings. While there is little data on the prevalence of di-mon matings in the field, they may be more common than is generally assumed (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib45">Nieuwenhuis et al., 2013</xref>). Given the potential for strong selection for mating fitness within a dikaryon, it is crucial to determine the relationship between nuclear competitiveness and mycelium-level fitness.</p><sec id="s4-1"><title>Conclusion</title><p>Potential benefits of a dikaryon stage have been a subject of discussion for some time. The presence of the dikaryotic state emphasizes the level of selection on the individual nuclei, something that is often overlooked in evolutionary discussions of fungi. The persistent association between unrelated haploid nuclei will invariably select for mating success, potentially to the detriment of the individual. Our results show the potential costs of selection at the level of nuclei for mating for mycelium-level fitness components, and how those can be reduced. First, restricting fertilization by dikaryons to monokaryons reduces the level of nuclear mating fitness and maintains a higher mycelium-level fitness, compared to completely free exchange between dikaryons. Second, if the variance in mating fitness and its associated trade-off is restricted to a single locus, the costs to mycelial level fitness are reduced. Most importantly, establishing the relationship between the different fitness components is crucial to understand the potential consequences of nuclear competition in the dikaryotic life cycle. We also hypothesize that recent examples of dikaryon nuclear exchange are due to monokaryotic intermediates or result from extremely rare events. Our results show that the consequences of competition between the unrelated haploid nuclei in a dikaryon can be severe, and there must exist mechanisms to police it.</p></sec><sec id="s4-2"><title>Data availability</title><p>Source to run simulations, as well as scripts to produce figures and analysis are found at <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://github.com/BenAuxier/Basid.Sex.Sim">https://github.com/BenAuxier/Basid.Sex.Sim</ext-link> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Auxier, 2021a</xref>).</p></sec></sec></body><back><sec id="s5" sec-type="additional-information"><title>Additional information</title><fn-group content-type="competing-interest"><title>Competing interests</title><fn fn-type="COI-statement" id="conf1"><p>No competing interests declared</p></fn></fn-group><fn-group content-type="author-contribution"><title>Author contributions</title><fn fn-type="con" id="con1"><p>Data curation, Formal analysis, Investigation, Methodology, Software, Visualization, Writing – original draft, Writing – review and editing</p></fn><fn fn-type="con" id="con2"><p>Conceptualization, Data curation, Formal analysis, Investigation, Methodology, Resources, Software, Writing – review and editing</p></fn><fn fn-type="con" id="con3"><p>Conceptualization, Investigation, Project administration, Supervision, Writing – review and editing</p></fn></fn-group></sec><sec id="s6" sec-type="supplementary-material"><title>Additional files</title><supplementary-material id="mdar"><label>MDAR checklist</label><media mime-subtype="docx" mimetype="application" xlink:href="elife-75917-mdarchecklist1-v2.docx"/></supplementary-material><supplementary-material id="scode1"><label>Source code 1.</label><caption><title>Pseudocode for the simulation algorithm.</title></caption><media mime-subtype="zip" mimetype="application" xlink:href="elife-75917-code1-v2.zip"/></supplementary-material></sec><sec id="s7" sec-type="data-availability"><title>Data availability</title><p>The current manuscript is a computational study, so no data have been generated.

In this paper the authors demonstrated that in fungi, 'stable unions' of two nuclei (dikaryons) are predicted to experience costs to vegetative fitness from investment in such mating opportunities. 'Open unions', in which third parties have access to the resources of established partnerships, are evolutionarily highly unstable. This paper will be of general interest to those who study evolutionary conflicts and to fungal geneticists.</p></body></sub-article><sub-article article-type="decision-letter" id="sa1"><front-stub><article-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.75917.sa1</article-id><title-group><article-title>Decision letter</article-title></title-group><contrib-group content-type="section"><contrib contrib-type="editor"><name><surname>Rokas</surname><given-names>Antonis</given-names></name><role>Reviewing Editor</role><aff><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="ror">https://ror.org/02vm5rt34</institution-id><institution>Vanderbilt University</institution></institution-wrap><country>United States</country></aff></contrib></contrib-group><contrib-group><contrib contrib-type="reviewer"><name><surname>James</surname><given-names>Timothy Y</given-names></name><role>Reviewer</role><aff><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="ror">https://ror.org/00jmfr291</institution-id><institution>University of Michigan</institution></institution-wrap><country>United States</country></aff></contrib><contrib contrib-type="reviewer"><name><surname>Haig</surname><given-names>David</given-names></name><role>Reviewer</role><aff><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="ror">https://ror.org/03vek6s52</institution-id><institution>Harvard University</institution></institution-wrap><country>United States</country></aff></contrib></contrib-group></front-stub><body><boxed-text id="sa2-box1"><p>Our editorial process produces two outputs: i) <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://sciety.org/articles/activity/10.1101/2020.05.28.103697">public reviews</ext-link> designed to be posted alongside <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://www.biorxiv.org/content/10.1101/2020.05.28.103697v2">the preprint</ext-link> for the benefit of readers; ii) feedback on the manuscript for the authors, including requests for revisions, shown below.
