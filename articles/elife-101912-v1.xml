Most human pre-implantation embryos are mosaics of euploid and aneuploid cells, yet those with a low proportion of aneuploid cells can develop to term at rates similar to fully euploid embryos. How embryos manage aneuploidy during early development remains poorly understood – yet this knowledge is crucial for improving fertility outcomes and reducing developmental defects. To investigate these mechanisms, we established a new mouse model of chromosome mosaicism to trace the fate of aneuploid cells during pre-implantation development. We previously used the Mps1 inhibitor reversine to induce aneuploidy. Here, we demonstrate that the more specific Mps1 inhibitor AZ3146 similarly disrupts chromosome segregation but supports higher developmental potential than reversine. AZ3146-treated embryos transiently upregulate hypoxia-inducible factor-1A (HIF1A) without triggering <italic>Trp53</italic> activation. Given that pre-implantation embryos develop in a hypoxic environment in vivo, we further explored the role of oxygen tension. Hypoxia exposure in vitro reduced DNA damage in response to Mps1 inhibition and increased the proportion of euploid cells in mosaic epiblast. Conversely, HIF1A inhibition decreased the proportion of aneuploid cells. Together, these findings uncover a role for hypoxia signaling in modulating the response to chromosomal errors and suggest new strategies to improve the developmental potential of mosaic human embryos.</p></abstract><kwd-group kwd-group-type="author-keywords"><kwd>aneuploidy</kwd><kwd>mosaicism</kwd><kwd>hypoxia</kwd></kwd-group><kwd-group kwd-group-type="research-organism"><title>Research organism</title><kwd>Mouse</kwd></kwd-group><funding-group><award-group id="fund1"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="ror">https://ror.org/01cwqze88</institution-id><institution>National Institutes of Health</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>R01HD101489</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Zernicka-Goetz</surname><given-names>Magdalena</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund2"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="ror">https://ror.org/02xhk2825</institution-id><institution>Pew Charitable Trusts</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>Pew Latin America fellowship</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Sanchez-Vasquez</surname><given-names>Estefania</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><funding-statement>The funders had no role in study design, data collection and interpretation, or the decision to submit the work for publication.</funding-statement></funding-group><custom-meta-group><custom-meta specific-use="meta-only"><meta-name>Author impact statement</meta-name><meta-value>Aneuploid mosaic mouse embryos require hypoxia for survival, and understanding these pathways may inform new strategies to support embryo viability.</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta specific-use="meta-only"><meta-name>publishing-route</meta-name><meta-value>prc</meta-value></custom-meta></custom-meta-group></article-meta></front><body><sec id="s1" sec-type="intro"><title>Introduction</title><p>Humans have relatively low fertility compared to other mammals, with only ~30% of conceptions resulting in live birth (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">Palmerola et al., 2022</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Capalbo et al., 2021</xref>). A striking feature of early human development is the high frequency of chromosome segregation errors during cleavage stage divisions, leading to aneuploidy – the gain or loss of chromosomes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Allais and FitzHarris, 2022</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Currie et al., 2022</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">Pauerova et al., 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib47">Vanneste et al., 2009</xref>). This high incidence of aneuploidy is thought to underlie low human fecundity and many developmental defects (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">Palmerola et al., 2022</xref>). Both in vivo and in vitro fertilization (IVF) frequently result in embryos that are chromosomally mosaic, containing a mixture of diploid and aneuploid cells. It is estimated that ~60% of pre-implantation IVF embryos exhibit this form of mosaicism (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Capalbo et al., 2021</xref>). Despite its prevalence, our understanding of how embryos respond to and cope with aneuploidy during early development remains limited.</p><p>The incidence of aneuploidy declines as development progresses (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib41">Shahbazi et al., 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib50">Yang et al., 2021</xref>), but the mechanism underlying this decline remains unclear. Remarkably, mosaic human embryos can develop to term (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Capalbo et al., 2021</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Greco et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib45">Starostik et al., 2020</xref>). Specifically, embryos classified as low- or medium-grade mosaics – defined by the presence of 20–30% or 30–50% aneuploid cells in the trophectoderm (TE) – have implantation and birth rates comparable to fully euploid embryos (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Capalbo et al., 2021</xref>). These observations raise a fundamental question: How do some mosaic embryos maintain developmental potential despite chromosomal abnormalities? Uncovering the mechanisms that support the viability of mosaic embryos is essential for improving reproductive outcomes and embryo selection strategies.</p><p>Mouse models of chromosome mosaicism provide a powerful system to investigate mechanisms that cannot be ethically studied in human embryos. Importantly, mouse and human pre-implantation development are highly similar: both undertake cleavage divisions, compaction, blastocyst cavity formation, and hatching, albeit with slightly different timings (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">Molè et al., 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib54">Zhu et al., 2021</xref>). During this period, outer cells differentiate into the extra-embryonic TE, whereas inner cells form the inner cell mass (ICM), which further segregates into the embryonic epiblast (EPI) or extra-embryonic primitive endoderm (PE). The TE will form the placenta, the PE will form the yolk sac, and the EPI will form the fetus (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib53">Zhu and Zernicka-Goetz, 2020</xref>).</p><p>Recently, our group developed the first mouse model of chromosome mosaicism by inducing aneuploidy using the small-molecule inhibitor reversine (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Bolton et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib43">Singla et al., 2020</xref>). Reversine is a pan-Aurora kinase inhibitor that also antagonizes the A3 adenosine receptor and inhibits mitotic kinase monopolar spindle 1 (MPS1) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">D’Alise et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib40">Santaguida et al., 2010</xref>). We found that reversine-treated mosaic embryos exhibit widespread aneuploidy and upregulation of p53 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Bolton et al., 2016</xref>). Importantly, aneuploid cells in mosaic embryos are progressively eliminated from the EPI, beginning around the time of implantation. Consistent with findings in human embryos (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Capalbo et al., 2021</xref>), murine mosaic embryos containing at least 50% of euploid cells had a similar developmental potential to fully euploid embryos (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Bolton et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib43">Singla et al., 2020</xref>).</p><p>However, because reversine affects p53 and may compromise cellular fitness (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">D’Alise et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib40">Santaguida et al., 2010</xref>), we sought to establish a complementary model using a more specific Mps1 inhibitor, AZ3146 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Hewitt et al., 2010</xref>). Although both AZ3146 and reversine interfere with the spindle assembly checkpoint, they bind to Mps1 in a different manner (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Lan and Cleveland, 2010</xref>). In mouse embryos, AZ3146 treatment was shown to double the occurrence of micronuclei, indicative of chromosome segregation defects, but without impairing overall cellular fitness (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib49">Vázquez-Diez et al., 2019</xref>). In this study, we use both AZ3146- and reversine-treated embryos to dissect the mechanisms governing aneuploid cell elimination and survival during pre-implantation development.</p></sec><sec id="s2" sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><sec id="s2-1"><title>AZ3146 treatment induces chromosome segregation defects in pre-implantation embryos</title><p>To generate distinct models of aneuploidy, we treated 4- to 8-cell stage mouse embryos with AZ3146 (20 µM) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib49">Vázquez-Diez et al., 2019</xref>), as well as with reversine (0.5 µM) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Bolton et al., 2016</xref>) as a positive control or DMSO (vehicle) as a negative control (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1A</xref>). We evaluated how the different Mps1 inhibitors affect chromosome segregation by detecting nuclei and kinetochores in 8-cell embryos and counting chromosomes in situ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">Pauerova et al., 2020</xref>). Micronuclei were identified as small DAPI-stained chromosomes that were clearly distinct from the nuclei (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1A</xref>). We examined 32 DMSO-treated control embryos and observed only 22 cells with micronuclei out of a total of 256 cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1B</xref>). In contrast, we observed 82 cells with micronuclei in a total of 144 individual cells from 18 reversine-treated embryos, and 182 cells in a total of 304 individual cells from 38 AZ3146-treated embryos (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1A</xref>). After normalization, the average of aneuploidy in DMSO-treated 8-cell embryos was 12.5%, compared to 75% in the reversine-treated embryos and 62.5% in the AZ3146-treated embryos (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1B</xref>). We also detected nondividing nuclei as rounded circles with distinct DAPI intensities in embryos treated with reversine and AZ3146. Specifically, we observed 28 nondividing cells (19%) in reversine-treated embryos and 24 nondividing cells (7.9%) in AZ3146-treated blastomeres, but none in DMSO-treated blastomeres (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1B</xref>). The increased frequencies of micronuclei and non-dividing cells in response to Mps1 inhibition are consistent with elevated aneuploidy and chromosomal instability (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Daughtry and Chavez, 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib48">Vázquez-Diez and FitzHarris, 2018</xref>), as we showed previously for reversine-treated embryos (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Bolton et al., 2016</xref>).</p><fig-group><fig id="fig1" position="float"><label>Figure 1.</label><caption><title>Lineage analysis of aneuploid embryos generated by selective Mps1 inhibitors AZ3146 and reversine.</title><p>(<bold>A</bold>) Graphic representation of 4-cell embryos treated with DMSO (control) or Mps1 inhibitors reversine (0.5 µM) and AZ3146 (20 µM) to inactivate the spindle assembly checkpoint (SAC) and induce chromosome segregation errors.

To this end, we treated embryos with DMSO, reversine, or AZ3146 from the 4- to 8-cell stage, and then washed and cultured them until the late blastocyst stage (E4.5). We assessed lineages by immunofluorescence (IF) to detect the TE marker CDX2, the EPI marker NANOG, and the PE marker SOX17. We found that all lineages segregated normally, and that blastocyst morphology was similar in all three conditions (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1B</xref>). We quantified the number of cells in the blastocysts and found that DMSO-treated controls had a median of 93 cells in total, whereas reversine- and AZ3146-treated embryos had a median of only 79 and 82 cells, respectively (n=28 embryos per treatment collected from three independent experiments; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1C</xref>). DMSO-treated blastocysts contained a median of 15 EPI, 11 PE, and 67 TE cells, whereas reversine-treated blastocysts contained 12 EPI, 8 PE, and 59 TE cells, and AZ3146-treated blastocysts had 11 EPI, 7 PE, and 64 TE cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1C</xref>). These data suggest that reversine treatment compromises the development of all three lineages, as observed previously (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Bolton et al., 2016</xref>), whereas AZ3146 mainly compromises ICM (EPI and PE) development (statistical test: Mann–Whitney U-test).</p><p>To compare the developmental potential of blastocysts that had been treated with AZ3146 or reversine, we transfer ~7 embryos per treatment into opposite uterine horns of the same mouse and counted decidua, which reflect successful implantation, as well as viable embryos at E9.5. Although two (8%) reversine-treated blastocysts developed decidua (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1C</xref>), none gave rise to viable E9.5 embryos. In contrast, seven (30%) AZ3146-treated blastocysts developed decidua (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1C</xref>) and five (21%) generated viable E9.5 embryos (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1D</xref>). Thus, AZ3146-treated embryos appear to have a higher developmental potential than reversine-treated embryos.</p><p>Considering that cellular fitness and aneuploid stress are related to DNA damage and DNA repair, we first sought to understand if these parameters were affected in our drug treatments. We used IF to quantify the levels of the DNA repair marker PARP1 and of the DNA damage marker, phosphorylated H2A.X (γH2A.X) at the 8-cell and morula stages (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1D</xref>). We observed elevated γH2A.X levels in reversine- and AZ3146-treated 8-cell embryos compared to controls (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1E</xref>) (n=~15 embryos per treatment, ~120 cells. Collection was made during three independent experiments. Statistical test: t-test), which eventually returned to normal in AZ3146-treated blastocysts, but not in reversine-treated blastocysts (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s2">Figure 1—figure supplement 2C</xref>).</p><p>PARP1 was specifically enriched in the EPI lineage in normal blastocysts, as assessed by IF (n&gt;21 embryos per treatment collected from three independent experiments.

Statistical test: Mann–Whitney U-test). To evaluate how early generation of aneuploidies in the embryos affects cell competition, we generated DMSO/AZ3146, reversine/DMSO, and reversine/AZ3146 aggregation chimeras at the 2-cell stage and cultured them under normoxia until the blastocyst stage (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s2">Figure 4—figure supplement 2C</xref>). We found that all three 2-cell stage aggregation chimeras developed into blastocysts with proper lineage segregation and the presence of a cavity (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s2">Figure 4—figure supplement 2D</xref>). Interestingly, the reversine-treated cells were extruded from the blastocyst in 54% of the reversine/DMSO chimeras and in 33% of the AZ3146/reversine chimeras, whereas no cell extrusion was observed in the DMSO/AZ3146 chimeras. Quantification of the proportion of AZ3146-treated cells in 2-cell stage-derived chimeras (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s2">Figure 4—figure supplement 2E</xref>) showed similar results as 8-cell stage-derived chimeras (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4F–G</xref>). In DMSO/AZ3146-treated blastocysts, we found that 49.28% of the TE, 39% of the EPI, and 33.33% of the PE originated from AZ3146-treated blastomeres (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s2">Figure 4—figure supplement 2E</xref>). In reversine/AZ3146 chimeras, 68.24% of the TE, 68.83% of the EPI, and 66.67% of the PE originated from AZ3146-treated cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s2">Figure 4—figure supplement 2E</xref>). In DMSO/reversine chimeras, 22.27% of the TE, 26.98% of the PE, and 31.7% of the EPI originated from reversine-treated cells. Overall, these results suggest that aneuploidy generated at different stages similarly affects the proportion of aneuploid cells in the blastocysts.</p></sec><sec id="s2-6"><title>HIF1A inhibition reduces the frequency of aneuploid cells in DMSO/AZ3146 mosaic embryos</title><p>Our data suggest that hypoxia affects aneuploid–euploid cell competition in mosaic embryos (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4</xref>). To further assess the effect of HIF1A, and considering most human embryos are cultured under hypoxic conditions, we decided to evaluate the effect of inhibiting HIF1A in mosaic embryos cultured in hypoxic conditions. We assembled DMSO/AZ3146 and reversine/AZ3146 8-cell stage chimeras, treated them with the HIF1A inhibitor IDF-11774 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5A</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5s1">Figure 5—figure supplement 1A and B</xref>), and then assessed lineage allocation in blastocysts.

Here, we describe complementary strategies for inducing aneuploidy in mouse embryos and reveal how the embryo’s response varies depending on the nature of the insult, cell lineage, and environmental context. Our findings support four key conclusions: (1) The Mps1 inhibitor AZ3146 induces aneuploidy while preserving DNA repair capacity and dampening stress responses, compared to the broader-acting inhibitor reversine. (2) Lineage-specific responses to aneuploidy emerge during blastocyst development, consistent with our earlier findings (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Bolton et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib43">Singla et al., 2020</xref>). (3) HIF1A promotes survival of extra-embryonic lineages (TE and PE) in AZ3146-treated embryos, whereas PARP1 is particularly required in the EPI of both AZ3146- and reversine-treated embryos. (4) Hypoxia enhances DNA repair and influences the competitive dynamics between aneuploid and euploid cells in mosaic embryos.</p><p>Reversine-treated embryos upregulate mRNA levels of senescent markers p53 and p21 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib43">Singla et al., 2020</xref>) and fail to give rise to viable embryos (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Bolton et al., 2016</xref>). Our current results further indicate that reversine downregulates PARP1, consistent with previous findings in glioma cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Hirakata et al., 2021</xref>), thereby exacerbating DNA damage and limiting DNA repair capacity. In contrast, AZ3146-treated embryos maintain PARP1 expression and exhibit increased HIF1A activity, which appears to support the survival of extra-embryonic lineages and improve overall developmental potential.</p><p>These findings intersect with a broader conversation about embryo culture conditions. It has been proposed that standard culture practices shift from normoxia (20% oxygen) to more physiologic hypoxia (5% oxygen) to better recapitulate the in vivo-like oviductal environment (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Alva et al., 2022</xref>). Indeed, hypoxic culture conditions have been shown to improve the quality of mammalian blastocysts (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Ciray et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">Nguyen et al., 2020</xref>), though the underlying mechanisms remain unclear. Studies in somatic cells suggest that hypoxia enhances DNA repair pathways (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Martí et al., 2021</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Nakamura et al., 2022</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">Pietrzak et al., 2018</xref>). In line with this, we observed reduced DNA damage in aneuploid embryos cultured under hypoxic conditions, consistent with prior reports of lower γH2A.X levels in mouse blastocysts recovered from the uterus or cultured in low oxygen (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Houghton, 2021</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Meuter et al., 2014</xref>). Furthermore, recent work in cancer cells indicates that hypoxia may promote HIF1A-PARP1 interactions, enhancing DNA repair (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Martí et al., 2021</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Nakamura et al., 2022</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">Pietrzak et al., 2018</xref>). Together, these findings highlight the interplay between chromosomal stress, lineage context, and the embryonic microenvironment in shaping cell fate during early development. A deeper mechanistic understanding of how DNA repair is regulated at pre-implantation stages will be crucial for elucidating how embryos tolerate or eliminate aneuploid cells – with important implications for improving embryo culture systems and fertility treatments.</p><p>Confined placental mosaicism, in which the placenta is aneuploid while the fetus is euploid, is a common phenomenon in human pregnancies (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">McCoy, 2017</xref>). In previous work, we showed that aneuploid TE cells exhibit prolonged cell cycles and signs of senescence, whereas aneuploid ICM cells have an increased frequency of apoptosis in reversine-treated embryos (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib43">Singla et al., 2020</xref>). These findings suggest that abnormal, yet viable TE cells may contribute to confined placental mosaicism. In the present study, we found that in AZ3146-treated embryos cultured under normoxic conditions, aneuploid cells contributed predominantly to the TE, followed by the EPI, and were especially depleted from the PE. Under hypoxic conditions, however, we observed a shift: aneuploid cells were more frequently eliminated from the EPI and enriched in the PE. These observations suggest that hypoxia modulates lineage-specific cell competition in mosaic embryos, potentially promoting a higher proportion of euploid cells in the EPI relative to the PE and TE. Moreover, we confirmed that the proportions of aneuploid cells in the TE and EPI do not correlate, consistent with the preferential survival of aneuploid cells in the TE and their selective elimination from the ICM. This is in line with clinical data showing low concordance of aneuploidy between TE and ICM in human mosaic embryos (30–40%) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Dahdouh and Garcia-Velasco, 2021</xref>). Lineage-specific elimination of aneuploid cells by apoptosis has been described in an in vitro model of human post-implantation development using reversine (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib50">Yang et al., 2021</xref>). Our findings mirror this distinction and further suggest that mechanisms of DNA repair – possibly involving PARP1 and HIF1A – may underlie the differential survival of aneuploid cells across lineages. Investigating how these pathways operate during post-implantation development will be crucial for understanding the developmental trajectories of mosaic embryos and the basis of placental mosaicism.</p><p>Since low- and medium-grade mosaic human embryos have similar developmental potential to fully euploid embryos (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Capalbo et al., 2021</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Greco et al., 2015</xref>), understanding the molecular pathways that govern the response to aneuploidy holds important translational promise. Given that the extent and proportion of aneuploid cells in mosaic embryos impact embryo viability (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Capalbo et al., 2021</xref>), strategies that reduce the aneuploid cell burden at the blastocyst stage may enhance the likelihood of a successful pregnancy. In this study, we targeted HIF1A as a potential regulator of aneuploid cell persistence and found that treatment with the HIF1A inhibitor IDF-11774 increased the proportion of euploid cells in mosaic embryos. Taken together, our findings reveal that specific environmental and molecular factors can modulate the composition of mosaic embryos, with potential implications for improving embryo quality and reproductive outcomes.</p></sec><sec id="s4" sec-type="materials|methods"><title>Materials and methods</title><sec id="s4-1"><title>Pre-implantation embryo culture</title><p>Mice were maintained according to national and international guidelines.

They found that AZ3146 acts similarly to reversine in inducing aneuploidy in embryos, but interestingly showed that the developmental potential of embryos is higher in AZ3146-treated vs. reversine-treated embryos. This difference was associated with changes in HIF1A, p53 gene regulation, DNA damage, and fate of euploid and aneuploid cells when embryos were cultured in a hypoxic environment.</p><p>Strengths:</p><p>In the current study, the authors investigate the fate of aneuploid cells in the preimplantation murine embryo using a specific aneuploidy-inducing compound to generate embryos that were chimeras of euploid and aneuploid cells. The strength of the work is that they investigate the developmental potential and changes in gene expression profiles under normoxic and hypoxic culture conditions. Further, they also assessed how levels of DNA damage and DNA repair are altered in these culture conditions. They also assessed the allocation of aneuploid cells to the divergent cell lineages of the blastocyst stage embryo.</p></body></sub-article><sub-article article-type="author-comment" id="sa2"><front-stub><article-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.101912.4.sa2</article-id><title-group><article-title>Author response</article-title></title-group><contrib-group><contrib contrib-type="author"><name><surname>Sanchez-Vasquez</surname><given-names>Estefania</given-names></name><role specific-use="author">Author</role><aff><institution>Division of Biology 139-74, California Institute of Technology</institution><addr-line><named-content content-type="city">Santa Cruz</named-content></addr-line><country>United States</country></aff></contrib><contrib contrib-type="author"><name><surname>Bronner</surname><given-names>Marianne E</given-names></name><role specific-use="author">Author</role><aff><institution>California Institute of Technology</institution><addr-line><named-content content-type="city">Pasadena</named-content></addr-line><country>United States</country></aff></contrib><contrib contrib-type="author"><name><surname>Zernicka-Goetz</surname><given-names>Magdalena</given-names></name><role specific-use="author">Author</role><aff><institution>California Institute of Technology</institution><addr-line><named-content content-type="city">Los Angeles</named-content></addr-line><country>United States</country></aff></contrib></contrib-group></front-stub><body><p>The following is the authors’ response to the previous reviews</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p><bold>Reviewer #1(Public review):</bold></p></disp-quote><p>We deeply appreciate the reviewer comments on our manuscript.

This is not the case as the in vivo environment is close to this value. 5% is normoxia. Clinical IVF/embryo culture occurs at 5% O2. Please adjust your narrative around this.</p><p>We define in our manuscript “normoxia” as the standard atmospheric oxygen levels in tissue culture incubators, which range from about 20–21% oxygen. Our definition of hypoxia is 5% concentration of oxygen, taking into consideration the standard levels of oxygen in the IVF clinics. Physiological oxygen in mouse varies from ~1.5% to 8% (Alva et al 2022). Considering that these levels of oxygen are the standard levels in tissue culture practices, a paragraph has been added to the discussion and materials and methods for further clarification</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p><bold>Reviewer #2 (Public review):</bold></p><p>Weakness:</p><p>Given that this is a study on the induction of aneuploidy, it would be meaningful to assess aneuploidy immediately after induction, and then again before implantation. This is also applicable to the competition experiments on page 7/8. What is shown is the competitiveness of treated cells. Because the publication centers around aneuploidy, inclusion of such data in the main figure at all relevant points would strengthen it. There is some evaluation of karyotypes only in the supplemental - why? Would be good not to rely on a single assay that the authors appear to not give much importance.</p></disp-quote><p>This is an excellent point. However, due to the stochasticity of the arising of aneuploidies when embryos are treated with AZ3146 and reversine (Bolton et al 2016), every treatment is likely to generate different levels of aneuploidy. Due to this, and to the technical limitations of generating single-cell genomic DNA sequencing at the blastocyst stage, we were unable to determine the karyotype of all cells after different conditions. Nevertheless, Regin et al 2024 (eLife) showed similar results on the overall transcriptome changes of different dosages of aneuploidy: high dosage embryos overexpress p53, like reversine-treated embryos; meanwhile, low dosage embryos overexpress the hypoxic pathway, including HIF1A, similar to embryos treated with AZ3146.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p><bold>Reviewer #1 (Recommendations for the authors):</bold></p><p>Corrections required before final publishing:</p><p>Please ensure that the number of asterisks is in alignment with standard convention (* &lt;0.05; ** &lt;0.01; *** &lt;0.001; **** &lt;0.0001).

However, at the blastocyst stage, high levels of γH2A.X are maintained in reversine-treated embryos and reduced in AZ3146-treated embryos, suggesting some level of DNA repair between the morula-to-blastocyst stages (Fig. S2A). In contrast, in hypoxia, the levels of γH2A.X are low in the three treatments at the morula stages, suggesting that DNA repair can be enhanced under hypoxic conditions.
