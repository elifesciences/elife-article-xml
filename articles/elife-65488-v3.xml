The understanding of the traditional role of mitochondria as the powerhouses of the cell has evolved as its multiple roles in cellular and physiological homeostasis have been functionally enumerated far beyond its commonly known role in energy production via the electron transport chain (ETC) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib56">Spinelli and Haigis, 2018</xref>). All these functions rely on a coordinated cross-talk between the nuclear genome and its mitochondrial counterpart (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib61">Vafai and Mootha, 2012</xref>). The widespread activity of mitochondria provides ample opportunities for mitochondrial dysfunction to play a role in human disease, but current understanding does not provide specificity in differential biological function or capacity in accurately predicting pathogenic details suitable for therapeutic development.</p><p>Here we focus on Leigh Syndrome, French Canadian Type (LSFC), an autosomal recessive mitochondrial disease with onset in infancy that manifests with diagnostic liver dysfunction (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">Morin et al., 1993</xref>). The most common allelic variant is due to an A354V transition in exon 9 of the leucine-rich pentatricopeptide repeat-containing motif (<italic>LRPPRC</italic>) protein (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">Mootha et al., 2003</xref>). Patients with mutations in the <italic>LRPPRC</italic> gene experience a diverse array of clinical features centered around cytochrome c oxidase (COX) deficiency. These can include early onset of hepatic micro vesicular steatosis and chronic lactic acidosis in neonates. Individuals born with LSFC have an average lifespan of less than 5 years of age with most succumbing to a series of extreme, acute metabolic crises. Patients that make it past the early life crises show a lessened disease state characterized by hypotonia, language and mobility deficits and delays, and muscle weakness (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">Morin et al., 1993</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Debray et al., 2011</xref>).</p><p>LRPPRC belongs to the pentatricopeptide repeat (PPR) containing motif family of proteins. The LRPPRC protein in humans has been reported to have 33 predicted PPR domains and is promiscuous, preferentially binding to different mitochondrial RNAs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib55">Spåhr et al., 2016</xref>). <italic>LRPPRC</italic> plays role in the regulation of both nuclear and mitochondrial RNA expression at the transcriptional and post-transcriptional levels (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Liu and McKeehan, 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">Mili and Piñol-Roma, 2003</xref>). Loss of functional <italic>LRPPRC</italic> in human fibroblasts, <italic>C. elegans,</italic> and mice revealed decreased stability of mitochondrial mRNAs, defects in mitochondrial biogenesis, decreased complex 1 and cytochrome c oxidase activity, and dysregulated mitochondrial translation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Cuillerier et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Gohil et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib67">Xu et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Köhler et al., 2015</xref>). Given that onset of LSFC is marked by the neurological and metabolic crisis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">Morin et al., 1993</xref>) and the liver is the major metabolic factory of the organism, therefore, the role of liver impairment in LSFC represents a unique aspect of mitochondrial disease unseen in traditional Leigh syndrome. Mice harboring liver-specific inactivation of <italic>Lrpprc</italic> mirrored similar clinical manifestations marked by mitochondrial hepatopathy, growth delay, and reduced fatty acid oxidation compared to controls (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Cuillerier et al., 2017</xref>). Recently, a lipidomic profile study on LSFC patients highlighted a novel role of this protein in the peroxisomal lipid metabolism (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib45">Ruiz et al., 2019</xref>). The current diagnosis of LSFC hinges on measuring lactate levels in the blood and brain, COX activity in patient fibroblasts, and sequencing of the <italic>LRPPRC</italic> gene for mutations (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Debray et al., 2011</xref>). The lack of a cure or effective therapies for LSFC patients signifies that current clinicians must shift their focus to relieving and controlling symptoms. Focus on dietary restrictions and lifestyle changes, including exercise and infection risk management, are made to reduce the physiological and metabolic stress on the patient. To build upon a heuristic paradigm for therapeutic interventions for these classes of disorders, we need to establish disease models that serve as a suitable substrate to recapitulate the key functional tissue-specific pathology of the disease.</p><p>Zebrafish have been employed as a powerful potential vertebrate model organism to study human mitochondrial disorders (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Broughton et al., 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib57">Steele et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib46">Sabharwal et al., 2019a</xref>). Previously, we have reported a compendium of approximately 1200 zebrafish transgenic lines created using the gene-breaking transposon approach out of which 204 were clonally validated and molecularly characterized (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Ichino et al., 2020</xref>). The GBT construct is incorporated into the intron of an endogenous gene via Tol2 transposase and uses a splice acceptor site to create a fusion protein between the native transcript and red fluorescent protein (<italic>mRFP</italic>) gene that contains a transcription termination site. When inserted intergenically, this results in the translation of a truncated endogenous gene product fused to <italic>mRFP</italic>. This enables spatiotemporal tracking of the trapped gene’s natural protein expression in real-time. This insertion is reversible due to two <italic>loxP</italic> sites located near each terminal repeat that enables the removal of the GBT cassette using <italic>Cre</italic> recombinase. The revertible nature of this construct allows for the reversion of the mutant back to wild-type alleles to allow for tissue-specific or ubiquitous rescue of the mutated gene (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Ichino et al., 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Clark et al., 2011</xref>). The previous work (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Ichino et al., 2020</xref>) reported over thirty new potential new models of human disease; we report here the characterization and detailed investigation of one, the mitochondrial protein-encoding locus <italic>lrpprc</italic>.</p><p>We describe here the first revertible zebrafish mutant with a single disruptive insertion in the <italic>lrpprc</italic> gene to model LSFC. <italic>lrpprc</italic> homozygous mutants mimic many hallmarks observed in patients such as early lethality, defective muscle development, and decreases in mitochondrial transcript levels. In addition, altered dietary lipid metabolism along with mitochondrial dysmorphology was also observed in these mutants. A key outcome of this study is the reversion of the LSFC-associated phenotype and survival using liver-specific <italic>Cre</italic> recombinase in the homozygous <italic>lrpprc</italic> mutants, demonstrating a critical role of this organ in the pathogenesis of disease in this animal model. These results contribute to a novel paradigm for the identification of therapeutic approaches for LSFC and other related disorders.</p></sec><sec id="s2" sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><sec id="s2-1"><title>Spatiotemporal expression dynamics of GBT0235 tagged by the <italic>in vivo</italic> protein trapping</title><p>Molecular analyses revealed that the <italic>in vivo</italic> protein trap line GBT0235 contained a single RP2.1 integration event within intron 22 of the <italic>lrpprc</italic> gene on chromosome 13 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1A–B</xref>).

To investigate the functional homology for PPR motifs in Lrpprc orthologs from humans and zebrafish, we first wanted to identify and annotate the PPR motifs. Since PPR motifs fold into a distinct structure of antiparallel alpha-helices, we were interested to interrogate the structure of the Lrpprc protein to estimate the occurrence of such helices across its tertiary structure. As no traditional structures for these protein orthologs were available, we derived predicted models using the AI-based protein structure prediction tool, RoseTTAFold. These models were used to identify the PPR motifs throughout the human and zebrafish Lrpprc proteins and to evaluate any structural similarities between the orthologs. Interestingly, many of the resulting derived PPR motifs in human LRPPRC were observed to be shorter than the canonical 35 amino acid PPR consensus motifs (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2</xref>). However, the human and zebrafish Lrpprc protein structures revealed that the signature PPR motif helix-turn-helix repeats were packed in a rigid conformation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2A–B</xref>). We manually annotated the occurrence of the hairpin of α-helices (PPR motifs) throughout the human and zebrafish Lrpprc models and numbered each starting from the <italic>N</italic>-termini of the proteins. Each hairpin of the α-helix is believed to bind to a single nucleotide target. This analysis identified 34 and 31 PPR motifs in the human and zebrafish Lrpprc orthologs, respectively (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s1">Figure 2—figure supplements 1</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s2">2</xref>).</p><fig-group><fig id="fig2" position="float"><label>Figure 2.</label><caption><title>Overall predicted structure of human and zebrafish LRPPRC and its C-terminus comparison with human LRPPRC.</title><p>(<bold>A</bold>) The predicted structure of mature human LRPPRC comprises 34 likely PPR repeats.

Phenotypic assessment of this novel allele demonstrates how zebrafish serve as an excellent model to study LSFC. Zebrafish Lrpprc shares 51% homology with its human ortholog and has 31 predicted similar PPR domains indicating the conserved mitochondrial mRNA binding role of this gene. The spatiotemporal analysis of Lrpprc<italic>-</italic>mRFP shows a co-localization with an established mitochondrial marker in the caudal fin region and myocytes, as the truncated fusion proteins retain the mitochondrial targeting sequence maintaining its predicted subcellular localization. We also observed remarkable ubiquitous expression patterns throughout the organism and hotspots in the liver, skeletal muscle, and eye. In addition, increased expression of the fusion protein in certain tissues such as the liver, skeletal muscle, and eyes is indicative of the observation that mitochondrial density is tied to energy-intensive processes like metabolism, movement, and vision. Differential expression data will nevertheless help in expanding our understanding of the different roles of this gene in tissue-specific niches.</p><p>Sequence analysis of the predicted zebrafish Lrpprc protein revealed the presence of some known homology domains like secretory (SEC)1, RPN7, DUF2517, and EAD11. SEC1 homology domain-containing proteins are known to be involved in vesicular trafficking, synaptic transmission, and general secretion (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Liu and McKeehan, 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Halachmi and Lev, 1996</xref>). In addition, the human LRPPRC protein interacted with various other protein partners like fibronectin through its SEC1 domain (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Liu and McKeehan, 2002</xref>). The effector-associated domains (EADs) are small, non-catalytic domains and are predicted to be involved in protein-protein interactions (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Kaur et al., 2021</xref>). The RPN7 domain is one of the regulatory subunits of the 26 S proteasome and is known to be required for structural integrity in <italic>Saccharomyces cerevisiae</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Isono et al., 2004</xref>). The region of zebrafish Lrpprc from amino acids 966–1012 had homology towards the protein of unknown function (DUF2517) domain, which is common to proteobacteria. The function of the DUF2517 homology domain is still unknown. Our in silico structural studies demonstrated that the C-terminus of human LRPPRC was well aligned with the C-terminus of zebrafish Lrpprc (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s3">Figure 2—figure supplement 3</xref>), strengthening the hypothesis that the zebrafish Lrpprc is playing a critical role in cell metabolism as discussed above. Additionally, the multiple sequence alignment of LRPPRC showed that the C-terminus region of this protein was conserved between several model organisms (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s3">Figure 2—figure supplement 3</xref>). Primary sequence and structural analyses highlighted the loss of domains important for maintaining the stability of mtRNA transcripts such as RPN7, DUF2517, SEC1, and EAD11 present in the C-terminus region of LRPPRC where a protein truncation led to LSFC-associated phenotype in zebrafish.</p><p>To understand the phenotypic and metabolic findings in the Lrpprc-deficient zebrafish model, we also analyzed the potential RNA binding targets of the Lrpprc protein. Lrpprc contains multiple PPR motifs, and these functional domains determine the target RNA-binding sites. We first annotated the PPR motifs for the Lrpprc protein for zebrafish and human orthologs to explore RNA binding sites. Preliminary analysis using the TPRpred server identified 22 PPR motifs for both human and zebrafish Lrpprc proteins (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Hammani et al., 2016</xref>). TPRpred is a profile-based method that uses a <italic>P</italic>-value-dependent score offset and exploits the tendency of repeats to occur in tandem (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Karpenahalli et al., 2007</xref>). This tool not only predicts the Tetratrico Peptide Repeat (TPR) motifs, but also the related PPRs and SEL1-like repeats. However, a study by Spåhr and colleagues had predicted 33 PPR motifs for the human LRPPRC protein (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib55">Spåhr et al., 2016</xref>) which was more than what was predicted by the TPRpred (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Karpenahalli et al., 2007</xref>) server. Additionally, we evaluated the secondary structure containing the Lrpprc proteins by PSIPRED server, we found that both humans and zebrafish are all α-helical and may contain more hairpin of α-helices than what TPRpred predicted. To address this discrepancy and to conduct a meticulous study to systematically identify PPR motifs in human and zebrafish Lrpprc, we employed a deep-learning-based structure modeling tool, RoseTTAFold (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Baek et al., 2021</xref>). Using RoseTTAFold we designed a workflow to predict 31 and 34 PPR motifs for the zebrafish and human orthologs respectively of Lrpprc proteins.</p><p>We investigated the sequences of the identified PPR motifs in each of the orthologs and deciphered the RNA recognition residues, which are typically found at the 5th and 35th positions in each PPR motif. These two amino acids play a major role in specifying the target nucleotide and constitute a code for nucleotide recognition. The potential target recognition codes for human and zebrafish Lrpprc PPR motifs were predicted to exhibit a range of nucleotide targets (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s1">Figure 2—figure supplements 1</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s2">2</xref>). We used the FIMO search algorithm to predict the potential binding sites for human and zebrafish Lrpprc proteins. <italic>In silico</italic> RNA-binding analysis revealed that transcripts coding for proteins involved in the complex IV activity such as <italic>mt-co1</italic> and <italic>mt-co2</italic> were among the hits with a high confidence score. Apart from complex IV genes, transcripts belonging to complex I and complex V were also identified to be recognized by the PPR motifs of the Lrpprc protein. There was a consensus for the majority of the target transcripts for the zebrafish and human orthologs indicating a conserved function of Lrpprc in the maintenance of the mitochondrial genome both in humans and zebrafish. Previously, human LRPPRC was reported to regulate transcripts coding for complex IV of mitochondrial electron transport chain (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib66">Xu et al., 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Barchiesi and Vascotto, 2019</xref>) which was very well aligned with these findings and supports the hypothesis that both human and zebrafish LRPPRC likely have similar mitochondrial targets. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first such analysis that has been performed and validated for PPR-based proteins.</p><p>Previously published reports have highlighted the role of PPR-containing proteins in mediating mRNA stability and translational activation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib42">Prikryl et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">Mesitov et al., 2019</xref>). PPR proteins have been shown to stabilize the RNA structure by blocking the access to exonucleolytic cleavage upstream and downstream of their binding sites in a way acting as protein caps at the 5’ and 3’ ends of the processed transcripts (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib42">Prikryl et al., 2011</xref>). It also confers a site-specific remodeling activity by sequestering the target RNA by preventing it from binding to the translation initiation region (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib42">Prikryl et al., 2011</xref>). Another functionality contributed by this class of proteins is aiding in the inhibition of uridylation of A-tailed transcripts, thereby preventing the degradation of mRNAs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">Mesitov et al., 2019</xref>). These roles highlight the role(s) of PPR motif-containing proteins in the stability of the mitochondrially encoded transcriptome.</p><p>Upon further investigation using independent transcriptomics sequencing and targeted mitochondrial RNA qPCR, it was observed that downregulated mtDNA genes in the <italic>lrpprc</italic> homozygous zebrafish mutants overlapped with those predicted by the above algorithm. These results possibly explain the reduced expression of mitochondrial RNAs in the homozygous mutants, underscoring the role of Lrpprc as loss of this protein impedes the binding of this protein, therefore leading to mRNA instability and degradation.</p><p>As the pathophysiology of LSFC is not well understood, we set out to explore the physiological consequences of <italic>lrpprc</italic> loss-of-function mutation <italic>in vivo</italic> and whether we could mimic the clinical hallmarks seen in LSFC patients. Similar to human patients, <italic>lrpprc<sup>GBT0235/GBT0235</sup></italic> mutants displayed complete larval lethality by 12 dpf. However, factors triggering the crisis and associated death in both patients and animal model was initially unclear. Consistent with previous <italic>in vitro</italic> studies (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Gohil et al., 2010</xref>), expression of mitochondrial protein-coding transcripts was observed to be downregulated in these homozygous mutants and was further investigated using RNASeq, indicating LRPPRC to be a critical post-transcriptional regulator of mitochondrial transcripts. LRPPRC protein in mitochondria forms a complex with SRA stem-loop interacting RNA binding protein (SLIRP) protein in the mitochondrial matrix. The absence of LRPPRC leads to oligoadenylation of the transcripts. LRPPRC-SLIRP is also observed to relax RNA structure, making the 5' end of the mRNA accessible for the mitochondrial ribosome to initiate the translation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Cui et al., 2019</xref>). The mechanistic insights in our zebrafish <italic>in vivo</italic> model from the structure of Lrpprc protein and target sites of the predicted PPR domains as described earlier correlate with observations that have been well established in patient-derived cell culture model displaying the altered signature of mitochondrial transcripts (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Gohil et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib50">Sasarman et al., 2015</xref>).</p><p>Decreased expression of these protein-coding transcripts is crucial for eliciting defects in oxidative phosphorylation and mitochondrial respiratory chain.

We did note an overlap between the set of differentially expressed genes and those in MitoCarta catalogue, suggesting an altered mitochondrial transcriptome signature. Apart from classical respiratory chain subunits, we identified some key genes from this overlapped data to be differentially expressed that were responsible for pathways such as aldehyde metabolism, fatty acid metabolism, and most important, unfolded protein response. Genes belonging to fatty acid metabolism and cytochrome P450 were observed to be downregulated in the null mutants. <italic>lrpprc</italic> homozygous mutants exhibited an upregulation of chaperone proteins, heat shock protein 5 (<italic>hspa5</italic>), and heat shock 60_1 (<italic>hspd1</italic>), possibly eliciting mitochondrial unfolded protein response that forms an integral part of mitochondrial protein homeostasis.</p><p>Another high energy-requisition tissue on the phenotypic spectrum of LSFC that we explored was muscle. LSFC patients display muscle defects such as hypotonia and COX deficiency (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib40">Oláhová et al., 2015</xref>) and therefore, we adopted a birefringence measurement to assess the muscle phenotype in our null mutants. It takes a complex and highly organized structure (like the sarcomeres in skeletal muscle) to rotate the plane-polarized light and enable the visualization of birefringence. The noted decrease in birefringence in <italic>lrpprc</italic> mutants is most likely due to the disorganization of sarcomeres and other structures in skeletal muscle. It has also been noted that LRPPRC deficiency in patient-derived muscle cells resulted in combined complex I and complex IV deficiency (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib50">Sasarman et al., 2015</xref>). These skeletal muscle defects due to impaired <italic>lrpprc</italic> function may reflect the tissue-specific adaptation to mitochondrial bioenergetics response. The structural analysis of identifying PPR motifs in zebrafish Lrpprc does explain some of these observations as it was revealed that the top potential binding sites of this protein were genes related to complex IV. A few of them were <italic>mt-co1</italic>, <italic>mt-co2,</italic> and <italic>mt-co3</italic> which encode subunits of the complex IV of the mitochondrial electron transport chain. Interestingly, muscle phenotypes that were displayed by <italic>lrpprc</italic> homozygous mutants were not mitigated by the liver-specific reversion of the mutagenicity cassette. This not only underscores the specificity of the revertible cassette in a given tissue but also indicates the improved survival and lipid homeostasis observed in rescued animals being at least partially independent of muscle dysfunction. One of the possible explanations for the impaired muscle function not contributing to lethality in rescued animals can be compensatory mitochondrial biogenesis or mitochondrial proliferation in muscle, a tissue with high metabolic demands that are also observed in patients with LSFC (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Cuillerier et al., 2021</xref>). There might be adaptive OXPHOS compensation in these kinds of tissues to adapt to the physiological demands in models with a mutation in genes affecting global mtDNA translation leading to multi-complex deficiency. Further studies will be required to explain any of these possibilities exploring the role of bioenergetic adaptation happening in a specific tissue through unknown metabolite and protein players in the cellular milieu.</p><p>The liver-specific dysfunction coupled with the episodes of acute metabolic crises distinguishes LSFC from classic Leigh Syndrome (LS). A previous study suggested that liver dysfunction may factor into the increased lactic acidosis and metabolic disturbances as the liver play a key role in lactate homeostasis via the Cori cycle (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib59">Sun et al., 2017</xref>). In addition, it is important to note that other basic liver functions that are dependent on mitochondrial activity such as lipid metabolism, serum detoxification, and gluconeogenesis may be key to the development of metabolic crises since they have secondary effects in other organ systems. Mitochondrial morphology is the classical hallmark of underlying mitochondrial dysfunction. Mitochondria can undergo changes in shape accompanied by fusion and fission events which may involve remodeling at cristae junctions that dynamically appose and separate from each other (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Cogliati et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Kondadi et al., 2020</xref>). Under TEM, hepatic mitochondria had an altered morphology in the homozygous mutants, potentially impairing mitochondrial function. From the transcript studies and motif-based target prediction, we did observe a decreased expression of <italic>mt-atp6</italic> and <italic>mt-atp8</italic> transcripts due to Lrpprc deficiency. Proteins coded by these mRNAs constitute the complex V of the electron transport chain. It has been reported that complex V plays an essential role in defining the cristae morphology specifically in the areas of high membrane curvature at cristae ridges (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Cuillerier et al., 2017</xref>).</p><p>It has been observed that mitochondrial disorders increase predisposition to intracellular lipid accumulation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">Morino et al., 2006</xref>). Homozygous <italic>lrpprc</italic> mutants manifested early-onset phenotypes with hepatomegaly and progressive accumulation of dark-colored granules in the liver at 6 dpf. These granules appeared to be lipid droplets, which were validated with both Oil Red O staining and extensive <italic>in vivo</italic> feed/chase (i.e., metabolize) labeling lipid studies. Dietary lipid metabolism studies in the homozygous mutants revealed an accumulation of non-polar lipids such as triglycerides and diglycerides. Accumulation of these lipid species highlights an impaired lipid metabolism in the mutants similar to what is observed in LSFC patients (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib45">Ruiz et al., 2019</xref>). Metabolic diseases such as nonalcoholic fatty liver disease are associated with the accumulation of triglyceride levels and high low-density lipoprotein levels with an underlying mitochondrial dysfunction (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib52">Simões et al., 2018</xref>). Hepatic accumulation of such lipids may induce mitochondria to undergo dynamic changes such as depolarization and loss of ATP content (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Domínguez-Pérez et al., 2019</xref>). Further probing of the transcriptomics study revealed that pathways for fatty acid degradation were depleted in these null mutants. The gene encoding for hepatic lipase_a (<italic>Lipca</italic>), a protein that plays an important role in triglyceride hydrolysis was downregulated by fold change of log<sub>2</sub> ~2. Accumulation of triglyceride levels in homozygous mutants was corroborated with findings from the RNA-Seq study, where genes such as Cytochrome P450 Family 7 Subfamily A or Cholesterol 7 alpha-hydroxylase (<italic>cyp7a1</italic>) and <italic>lipca</italic> were observed to be downregulated. These genes are involved in the Farnesoid X receptor pathway that plays an important role in hepatic triglyceride metabolism (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Jiao et al., 2015</xref>). Interestingly, we observed the targets for the sterol regulatory element-binding proteins (SREBPs) to be differentially expressed. Prominent amongst those were ELOVL fatty acid elongase 2 (<italic>elovl2</italic>), fatty acid desaturase 2 (<italic>fads2),</italic> and <italic>lipca. Elovl2</italic> is essential for lipid homeostasis, wherein it regulates the levels of poly-unsaturated fatty acids preventing liver steatosis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib41">Pauter et al., 2014</xref>). The binding proteins are thought to manage intracellular fatty acids and serve to provide them to specific enzyme pathways in the cytoplasm. Similarly, reduced <italic>lipca</italic> would result in fewer cytoplasmic fatty acids consistent with the less cellular requirement of fatty acid-binding proteins (also observed to be downregulated in our data). Reduced availability of fatty acids would allow fewer substrates for ELOVL2 and FADS2. Another lipid metabolism-associated gene observed to be downregulated was fatty acid-binding protein 10 a (<italic>fabp10a</italic>) by fold change of log<sub>2</sub> ~2.27. Intrigued to explore, if the abolishment of <italic>lrpprc</italic> had an inter-organelle effect, we analyzed the expression of genes that are involved in peroxisome-associated pathways. To summarize, the transcriptomic analysis did reveal that <italic>lrpprc</italic> homozygous mutants displayed altered expression of genes that modify and regulate fatty acids and were consistent with less fatty acid reflux and metabolism observed in <italic>lrpprc</italic> homozygous mutants. Surprisingly, MPV17 mitochondrial inner membrane protein-like 2 (<italic>mpv17l2</italic>), one of the regulator genes for the expression of antioxidant enzymes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Iida et al., 2006</xref>), was upregulated by fold change of log<sub>2</sub> 1.74. Overall, our zebrafish LSFC model exhibited a dysfunctional mitochondrial signature both at the transcriptional and phenotypic level, which was explored to design a genetic model therapy for LSFC-associated phenotypes.</p><p>The key translational and clinical utility of this study is the reversion of the LSFC-associated phenotype and survival using liver-specific Cre recombinase in the homozygous <italic>lrpprc</italic> mutants, demonstrating a critical role of this organ in the pathogenesis of disease in this animal model. Because GBT-RP2 contains two <italic>loxP</italic> sites flanking the protein trap component, we could exploit this utility to rescue the organ-specific function of <italic>lrpprc<sup>GBT0235/GBT0235</sup></italic>. Interestingly, reversion of both lethality and biochemical phenotypes was observed in the rescued mutants, suggesting the liver plays a critical role in the pathology of LSFC. Although the rescue of mortality phenotype in the Cre <italic>lrpprc</italic> homozygous mutants was remarkable, it should be noted that longitudinal studies are needed to follow up on the survival of the rescued larvae. However, there will be a few points such as variables in zebrafish husbandry settings and the expression of the transgenic recombinase in the hepatocytes that will need to be considered while designing such experiments. Further experiments are required to delineate the juvenile or adult-onset mortality in the rescued animals due to the expression of truncated Lrpprc protein in the whole body minus liver or due to constitutive expression of Cre recombinase in the liver.</p><p>Remarkably, these liver-specific rescued larvae exhibited similar levels of non-polar lipids as compared to the wild-type larvae, post-high-fat meal underscoring the lipid homeostasis as a key therapeutic paradigm in the progression of this disease. Mitigation of abnormal mitochondrial structure was also observed in the hepatocytes of the rescued larvae. Although we did observe that rescue was not completely reversible in the liver-specific Cre homozygous mutants. There may be several factors that can contribute to this observation such as incomplete penetrance or rescue of the mutant allele. As cristae are dynamic structures of mitochondria whose morphology is altered under various bioenergetics and physiological conditions (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Cogliati et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Kondadi et al., 2020</xref>), reversion of mutagenicity cassette in the hepatocytes is not sufficient to correct cristae alterations that appeared to be aggravated in the <italic>lrpprc</italic> homozygous mutants. A possible explanation for the restoration in the morphology may be attributed to the restoration of levels of mitochondrial transcripts and thus restoring mitochondrial-mediated liver functions such as beta-oxidation and fatty acid elongation.</p><p>With advances in gene editing alongside developments in both viral and non-viral vector delivery, there is hope for tissue-specific gene therapy as a potential avenue to help mitochondrial disease patients. Our findings highlight the potential therapeutic applications of advances in gene therapy for patients of LSFC by rescuing <italic>lrpprc</italic> expression in the liver. We anticipate that these results, together with those from the conditional knockout experiments will enhance our understanding of the function of the <italic>lrpprc</italic> gene in hepatic lipid homeostasis and shine a light on new therapeutic options.</p></sec><sec id="s4" sec-type="materials|methods"><title>Materials and methods</title><table-wrap id="keyresource"

For Lightsheet microscopy, larval zebrafish were anesthetized with 1 X tricaine in embryo water during the imaging procedure. RFP expression patterns of 6 dpf larval zebrafish were captured using LP 560 nm filter as excitation and LP 585 nm as emission using a Lightsheet 7 microscope (Zeiss, Germany) with 5 X objective. Confocal microscopy was carried out by embedding the 6 dpf larvae in 1% (w/v in E2 medium containing tricaine) low-melting agarose (Fisher Scientific, USA) in a 50 mm glass-bottom dish (MatTek, USA). Once the agarose was set, it was immersed in an E2 medium containing tricaine to prevent drying. Each set of brightfield and RFP images for both heterozygous and homozygous mutants were acquired using Zeiss LSM780 (63XW/1.2 NA) and the images shown are the maximum image projections of the z-stacks obtained from each direction. Laterally oriented Z-stacks of representative images of the caudal fin for GFP and mRFP expressions were captured using the laser with Ex488 and Ex561, respectively under a 63XW/1.2 NA water objective.

Briefly, <italic>lrpprc<sup>+/+</sup></italic>, <italic>lrpprc<sup>GBT0235/GBT0235</sup></italic> and <italic>Tg(fabp10:Cre)lrpprc<sup>GBT0235/GBT0235</sup></italic> larvae were rinsed three times (5 min each) with 1×PBS/0.5% Tween-20 (PBS-T). After removing PBS-T, larvae were stained with a mixture of 300 µL of 0.5% ORO in 100% isopropyl alcohol and 200 µL of distilled water for 15 min. Larvae were then rinsed with 1×PBS-Tween-20 three times, twice in 60% isopropyl alcohol for 5 min each, and then mounted for imaging. Oil Red O images were captured with a color camera in JPEG format. For each batch of images (corresponding to one day of experiments), an image with dark Oil Red O staining and an image with light Oil Red O staining were respectively used to determine the lower and upper threshold values for positive staining. Briefly, the lower edge of the threshold was set as the level that most pixels representing melanocytes were darker than, but almost all dark Oil Red O staining was brighter than. Similarly, the upper edge of the threshold was determined to be at the level where most pixels representing the background outside of the fish were brighter than, but some light Oil Red O staining was darker than. This left a range between upper and lower threshold limits of 40–60 values that encompassed the most Oil Red O staining. To quantify only the Oil Red O staining in the liver, we drew a single region of interest that bordered the liver of the most darkly stained larvae and used this same ROI template between replicates. All outlined regions were saved as regions of interest (ROIs). Within these ROIs, measurements for the area were obtained and plots and statistical analyses were performed. This region of interest (ROI) specifically excluded the area around the swim bladder due to the swim bladder having high amounts of background stain in the majority of images. Within this ROI, the area of pixel values within the threshold in each larva was determined using the ‘limit to threshold’ option in the ‘set measurements’ menu in FIJI and normalized to the average oil red stain area of the wild-type group.</p></sec><sec id="s4-18"><title>Electron microscopy of hepatocyte mitochondria</title><p>Zebrafish larvae were fixed and imaged using transmission electron microscopy as described in the previous study (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib64">Wilson et al., 2020</xref>). Briefly, 8 dpf embryos were fixed for 1–3 hr in a mixture of 3% glutaraldehyde, 1% formaldehyde, and 0.1 M cacodylate. Embryos were embedded in 2% low melt agarose followed by processing as described earlier (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib69">Zeituni et al., 2016</xref>). Following embedding steps, post-fixation for 1 hr with 1% osmium tetroxide and 1.25% potassium ferricyanide in cacodylate solution occurred. Larvae were rinsed twice with water and incubated in 0.05 maleate pH 6.5 before staining overnight at 4 °C in 0.5% uranyl acetate. Following overnight incubation, samples were washed with water and dehydrated using ethanol dilution. Samples were washed with propylene oxide and then incubated with propylene oxide/resin followed by an overnight evaporation period. Finally, larvae were embedded in 100% resin at 55 °C overnight and then 70 °C for three days. Sectioning was performed on Reichert Ultracut-S (Leica Microsystems, Germany), mounted on mesh grids, and stained with lead citrate. Images were taken using a Phillips Technai-12 electron microscope and a 794 Gatan MultiScan CCD camera.

Since larvae can vary greatly in the amount they ingest, non-metabolizable TopFluor Cholesterol (conc, 23-(dipyrrometheneboron difluoride)–24-norcholesterol; Avanti Lipids, USA) was added to the feed solution to serve as a readout of the amount ingested, allowing for normalization of the HPLC output. TopFluor Cholesterol is harder to get into solution compared to BODIPY FL C12: embryo medium and 1% fatty acid-free BSA was prewarmed to 30 °C. After 4 hr of feeding in a light-shielded shaking incubator (30 °C, 30 rpm), larvae were rinsed in fresh embryo media and screened for ingestion (darkened intestines) under a stereomicroscope. Larvae that did not eat were excluded from the study. Larvae that ate were moved to tissue culture plates with fresh embryo media for an overnight chase period of 12.5 hr in a 28.5 °C light-cycling (14 hr on, 10 hr off) incubator. Pools of 8–13 larvae from each group were snap-frozen on dry ice in microcentrifuge tubes and stored dry at –80 °C for lipid extraction.</p></sec><sec id="s4-20"><title>HPLC analyses of long-chain fatty acids</title><p>Frozen samples of pooled larvae were subjected to lipid extraction using a modified Bligh-Dyer procedure. Extractions were dried and resuspended in HPLC-grade isopropanol. Sample components were separated and detected by an HPLC system as described previously (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib43">Quinlivan et al., 2017</xref>). Chromatographic peak baselines were manually delimited and peak areas were automatically measured (Chromeleon 7.2; Thermo Fisher Scientific). Peak areas per larval equivalent were calculated and normalized to the TopFluor Cholesterol peak (non-metabolizable; added to the fluorescent fatty acid feed). To fit a linear model wherein the outcomes may have possible unknown correlations, generalized estimated equations (gee) were performed on the R platform comparing total non polar lipid area as well as individual peaks/groups of peaks. Assessment of normality by visual examination of Q-Q (quantile-quantile) plots confirmed that the standard normal curve is a valid approximation for the distribution of the data. P-values were obtained from the standard normal Z-table.</p></sec><sec id="s4-21"><title>Statistical analyses</title><p>Plots and statistical analyses including the Mann-Whitney test, unpaired t-test, and construction of heat map were performed in GraphPad Prism 8.

The authors further characterized a mutant line initially reported in a previous <italic>eLife</italic> resources paper that describe a collection of mutations that reveal the expression dynamics of mutated gene and can be reverted by Cre. They showed that an insertion of GBT into <italic>Lrpprc</italic> gene, whose human ortholog underlies the more rare form of LSFC, disrupts the gene product, leading to hallmarks of LSFC including fatty liver, skeletal muscle defects, and death by 11 dpf in the homozygotes. This thus represents a zebrafish model of LSFC. As expected, the gene product is localized to mitochondria. Further analyses demonstrated a decrease of mitochondrial transcripts, an increase of non-polar lipids, and altered expression of genes associated with lipid metabolism and peroxisome associated pathways. Taking advantage of the reversibility of the mutation, the authors further show that correction of the mutation only in the liver is sufficient to largely correct the lethality and the lipid profile. Although brain and liver mitochondrial function of <italic>Lrpprc</italic> is known to more severely impacted than other tissues in the patients due to their high metabolic demand, that rescue of <italic>Lrpprc</italic> function in liver can largely reverse the lethality is an interesting and unexpected finding. The studies further demonstrate the advantages of the mutant collection. Although the manuscript is clearly written and data are of good quality, several issues in the current form need to be addressed.</p><p>1) Much of the analysis focuses on known phenotypes in lipid metabolism of <italic>Lrpprc</italic> deficiency in mammals. LSFC patients have defects in many tissues/organs, e.g. neuronal necrosis. These are at least partially independent of liver dysfunction. Does the liver specific <italic>Lrpprc</italic> rescue affect neuronal death?</p><p>2) The product of <italic>Lrpprc</italic> is important for several aspects of mitochondrial biology including biogenesis. The authors did not address mitochondrial copy number. Do mutant cells have fewer mitochondria? This is also important in interpreting the qRT-PCR results (Figure 3B). Is the decreased expression due to a decrease of mitochondrial number, RNA stability, or both?</p><p><italic>Reviewer #3 (Recommendations for the authors):</italic></p><p>In this manuscript, the authors aim to create a zebrafish model for Leigh Syndrome French Canadian Type (LSFC) by knocking out the irpprc gene responsible for the disease. In previous works, the authors collected transgenic fish lines that labelled specific proteins via a protein trap approach and identified the <italic>Lrpprc</italic> knockout fish. The authors analyzed the homozygous mutant phenotypes by RNA-seq, microscopic analyses, electron microscopy, and a fluorescent fatty acid analog. The authors found deficits in liver and muscle development and in liver functions (including lipid metabolism). Further, taking advantage of the feature of the protein trap vector, the orientation of the protein trap vector was reversed and the mutant phenotypes were rescued. Thus, by using a useful model vertebrate zebrafish, the authors successfully established a conditionally controllable LSFC model, which should be useful to understand the function of the <italic>Lrpprc</italic> gene and the mechanism of the disease.</p><p>The major strength of this work is (1) detailed descriptions of the mutant phenotypes (lipid accumulation in the liver, mitochondrial morphology defects, and altered lipid metabolism), and (2) successful demonstration of genetic rescue of the mutant phenotypes.</p><p>The weakness of the work is (1) a mouse model in which the <italic>Lrpprc</italic> gene was knocked out specifically in the hepatocytes has been described previously, (2) overall the manuscript was rather descriptive and poor in mechanistic aspects of the <italic>Lrpprc</italic> function and pathology of LSFC, and (3) it was not clearly shown how this genetic model is useful to study the function of <italic>Lrpprc</italic> and open a way to new therapeutic options as the authors discussed in the Discussion section.</p><p>1) In abstract, the authors say, &quot;created 1200 transgenic zebrafish strains tagging protein-coding genes&quot;. However, in their previous manuscript (Ichino et al. 2020), out of 1200, 204 lines were proved to actually trap proteins. Therefore, this number should be 204.</p><p>2) The mechanistic analysis of muscle defects was lacking.</p><p>3) The mechanism how down-regulated and upregulated genes in the mutants are controlled by <italic>Lrpprc</italic> was not experimentally analyzed and described.</p><p>4) How was the mitochondria morphology altered was not shown.</p><p>5) The mechanism to control lipid metabolism was totally unknown.</p></body></sub-article><sub-article article-type="reply" id="sa2"><front-stub><article-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.65488.sa2</article-id><title-group><article-title>Author response</article-title></title-group></front-stub><body><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Reviewer #1 (Recommendations for the authors):</p><p>The manuscript by Sabharwal et al. describes a zebrafish model of Leigh Syndrome, French Canadian Type (LSFC).

Does the liver specific Lrpprc rescue affect neuronal death?</p></disp-quote><p>Authors appreciate the suggestion provided by the reviewer. Reviewers have brought up an interesting aspect of exploring the rescue of other tissue defects such as brain or muscle upon the reversion of <italic>Lrpprc</italic> expression in the liver. We did experiments to assess the muscle phenotype by birefringence microscopy and neural necrosis by staining the larvae for acridine orange.</p><p>In addition to the above comment, we were intrigued to see whether the muscle phenotype is dependent on the defects in the liver lipid homeostasis. To see the global effect of liver-specific rescue, we investigated the muscle phenotype in the liver rescued <italic>Lrpprc</italic> homozygous larvae, <italic>Tg(fabp10:Cre)/Lrpprc<sup>GBT0235/GBT0235</sup></italic>. We measured muscle birefringence of the mutants at 4-days post-fertilization as an assessment of overall muscle structure. The analysis from the muscle studies on mutants revealed that <italic>Lrpprc</italic> homozygous larvae displayed a lower birefringence signal highlighting a disrupted muscle structure/integrity. A similar phenotype was also observed in liver-rescued homozygous animals, where muscle integrity was not observed to be restored (data provided below). These results possibly highlight that the muscle defects do not contribute to the larval lethality that we see in the loss of function embryos and the liver-specific rescue wasn’t able to restore the muscle phenotype, despite the liver-rescued rescued larvae showing improved survival.</p><p>We have modified the text and included the above findings in the revised manuscript:</p><p>Results (Page 8; lines 194-197): “Assessment for the muscle phenotype in the 4 dpf liver-rescued homozygous mutants displayed a similar decrease in the parameters for muscle integrity such as integrated birefringence density as compared to homozygous mutants (Figure 5—figure supplement 1).”</p><p>Discussion (Page 16; lines 421-425): “Interestingly, muscle phenotypes that were displayed by <italic>Lrpprc</italic> homozygous mutants were not mitigated by the liver-specific reversion of the mutagenicity cassette. This not only underscores the specificity of the revertible cassette in a given tissue but also indicates the improved survival and lipid homeostasis observed in rescued animals being at least partially independent of muscle dysfunction.”</p><p>Materials and methods (Page 32; lines 694-696): “<italic>Tg(fabp10:Cre)/Lrpprc<sup>GBT0235/+</sup></italic> were incrossed to obtain <italic>Tg(fabp10:Cre)/Lrpprc<sup>GBT0235/235</sup></italic>, homozygous mutants only expressing Cre recombinase in the liver.”</p><p>To address the question if the liver specifically affects neuronal death, the authors looked for neuronal death first in the <italic>Lrpprc</italic> homozygous mutants. To observe any incidence of neuronal necrosis, <italic>Lrpprc</italic> homozygous mutants and wild-type embryos were stained with acridine orange.

In previous works, the authors collected transgenic fish lines that labelled specific proteins via a protein trap approach and identified the Lrpprc knockout fish. The authors analyzed the homozygous mutant phenotypes by RNA-seq, microscopic analyses, electron microscopy, and a fluorescent fatty acid analog. The authors found deficits in liver and muscle development and in liver functions (including lipid metabolism). Further, taking advantage of the feature of the protein trap vector, the orientation of the protein trap vector was reversed and the mutant phenotypes were rescued. Thus, by using a useful model vertebrate zebrafish, the authors successfully established a conditionally controllable LSFC model, which should be useful to understand the function of the Lrpprc gene and the mechanism of the disease.</p><p>The major strength of this work is (1) detailed descriptions of the mutant phenotypes (lipid accumulation in the liver, mitochondrial morphology defects, and altered lipid metabolism), and (2) successful demonstration of genetic rescue of the mutant phenotypes.</p><p>The weakness of the work is (1) a mouse model in which the Lrpprc gene was knocked out specifically in the hepatocytes has been described previously, (2) overall the manuscript was rather descriptive and poor in mechanistic aspects of the Lrpprc function and pathology of LSFC, and (3) it was not clearly shown how this genetic model is useful to study the function of Lrpprc and open a way to new therapeutic options as the authors discussed in the Discussion section.</p><p>1) In abstract, the authors say, &quot;created 1200 transgenic zebrafish strains tagging protein-coding genes&quot;.

In the present manuscript, we have described manifestations that are observed in LSFC patients, one of which is found as muscle defects.

Future genetic testing using muscle-specific Cre lines, for example, could be used to separate the potential role of targeting <italic>Lrpprc</italic> in muscle for enhanced therapeutic outcomes. To address this comment and as described in the response to reviewer 1’s comment 1, we were intrigued to see if the muscle phenotype is dependent on the defects in the liver lipid homeostasis.</p><p>To see the global effect of liver-specific rescue, we investigated muscle phenotype in the liver rescued <italic>Lrpprc</italic> homozygous larvae, <italic>Tg(fabp10:Cre)/Lrpprc<sup>GBT0235/GBT0235</sup></italic>. We measured the muscle birefringence of the mutants at 4 days post-fertilization to address the above-mentioned question. The analysis from the muscle studies on mutants revealed that <italic>Lrpprc</italic> homozygous larvae displayed a lower birefringence signal highlighting a disrupted muscle structure/integrity. A similar phenotype was also observed in liver-rescued homozygous animals, where muscle integrity was not observed to be restored (data provided below). These results possibly highlight that the muscle defects do not contribute to the larval lethality that we see in the loss of function embryos and liver rescue wasn’t able to restore the muscle phenotype, despite rescued larvae showing improved survival.</p><p>We have modified the text and discussed the above findings in the revised manuscript:</p><p>Results (Page 8; lines 194-197): “Assessment for the muscle phenotype in the 4 dpf liver-rescued homozygous mutants displayed a similar decrease in the parameters for muscle integrity such as integrated birefringence density as compared to homozygous mutants (Figure 5—figure supplement 1).”</p><p>Discussion (Page 16; lines 421-425): “Interestingly, muscle phenotypes that were displayed by <italic>Lrpprc</italic> homozygous mutants were not mitigated by the liver-specific reversion of the mutagenicity cassette.

Having structural insights into this protein will allow us to investigate the homology of the critical functional domains that have been studied in the human orthologue. Using the AI-based structure prediction tool, RoseTTAFold, we were able to predict the structure of the zebrafish Lrprrc protein for the first time. We did annotate the PPR motifs and our analyses revealed that Zebrafish <italic>Lrpprc</italic> shares 51% homology with its human ortholog and has 31 predicted similar PPR domains as compared to 34 PPR domains to its human counterpart, indicating the conserved mitochondrial mRNA binding role of this gene. Primary sequence analysis and structural analysis highlighted the loss of domains important for maintaining the stability of mtRNA transcripts such as RPN7, DUF2517, SEC1, and EAD11 present in the C-terminus region of <italic>LRPPRC</italic> where a single disruptive insertion led to LSFC-associated phenotype in zebrafish. We identified several mitochondrial encoded genes as targets using the FIMO motif search tool of the MEME Suite and matches with the twenty lowest P-values were shown in supplementary tables 1 and 2. The human and zebrafish ortholog do share an overlapping signature of transcripts having binding sites in the respective PPR motifs. The candidates identified from this list were observed to be downregulated in the RNA sequencing datasets and validated by qPCR. Previously, human <italic>LRPPRC</italic> was reported to regulate transcripts coding for complex IV of mitochondrial electron transport chain which was very well aligned to our findings and established our hypothesis that both human and zebrafish <italic>LRPPRC</italic> might have similar mitochondrial targets.</p><p>We have modified the text and discussed the above findings under the sections mentioned below in the revised manuscript:</p><p>Materials and methods (pages 26-27; lines 535-560): “Structure-based prediction of RNA binding targets for <italic>Lrpprc</italic> protein: To predict the target transcripts of human and zebrafish <italic>Lrpprc</italic>, we first calculated the AI-based models for both human and zebrafish full-length <italic>Lrpprc</italic> proteins using RoseTTAFold. RoseTTAFold is a three-track neural network-based system and has enabled us to predict the structures of the proteins at a high level of accuracy and detail (33). Both the molecular models were computed by using the mforge servers of Mayo Clinic hosted by the University of Illinois Urbana-Champaign (UIUC). The resulting structure files were then rendered with PyMOL (The PyMOL Molecular Graphics System, Version 2.5.2 Schrödinger, LLC). Multiple sequence alignment of different <italic>LRPPRC</italic> sequences from different model organisms was conducted using CLUSTAL Omega v.1.2.4 (52) by taking the default parameters and visualized by using Jalview v.2.11.1.7 (53) software. The homology domain organization was predicted by using the Pfam HMM database search (http://pfam.xfam.org/). PPR motifs were predicted and annotated using the TPRpred (32) server and also by independently assessing the zebrafish and human <italic>Lrpprc</italic> predicted structures.</p><p>We used this structural information and the PPR cipher code to identify consensus binding sequences (Figure 2—figure supplement 1 and figure supplement 2). We determined the putative target nucleotide sequence by using the identities of the amino acids at the 5th and 35th positions of each PPR motif of human and zebrafish <italic>Lrpprc</italic> proteins. We used the IUPAC degenerate nucleotide codes to obtain a consensus nucleotide sequence. These consensus sequences were then used to identify potential binding targets of human and zebrafish <italic>Lrpprc</italic> by deploying the FIMO motif scanning program in the MEME Suite (https://meme-suite.org/meme/tools/fimo). The FIMO program searches for the occurrences of known motifs in the sequence databases. The putative nucleotide sequence was then used to search human and zebrafish <italic>Lrpprc</italic> RNA binding sites against the mitochondrial genomes of humans (NC_012920.1) and zebrafish (NC_002333.2) respectively using the FIMO program. The predicted target sites were ranked by P- values calculated by FIMO (54).”</p><p>Results (pages 5-6; lines 107-145): “Structure-based analysis reveals <italic>Lrpprc</italic> binding sites in the mitochondrial transcriptome: PPR proteins contain tandem arrays of degenerate ~35-amino acids motifs that fold into a hairpin of antiparallel α-helices (19, 20). PPR proteins bind to their target RNAs in a modular and base-specific fashion (19). The 5th and 35th amino acids of each PPR motif determine the target nucleotide, and the ordering of the repeat motif elements in the respective PPR proteins can function as determinants to assign sequence binding specificity (20). To investigate the functional homology for PPR motifs in <italic>Lrpprc</italic> orthologs from humans and zebrafish, we first wanted to identify and annotate the PPR motifs. Since PPR motifs fold into a distinct structure of antiparallel α-helices, we were interested to interrogate the structure of the <italic>Lrpprc</italic> protein to estimate the occurrence of such helices across its tertiary structure. As no traditional structures for these protein orthologs were available, we derived predicted models using the AI-based protein structure prediction tool, RoseTTAFold. These models were used to identify the PPR motifs throughout the human and zebrafish <italic>Lrpprc</italic> proteins and to evaluate any structural similarities between the orthologs. Interestingly, many of the resulting derived PPR motifs in human <italic>LRPPRC</italic> were observed to be shorter than the canonical 35 amino acid PPR consensus motifs (Figure 2). However, the human and zebrafish <italic>Lrpprc</italic> protein structures revealed that the signature PPR motif helix-turn-helix repeats were packed in a rigid conformation (Figure 2A-B). We manually annotated the occurrence of the hairpin of -helices (PPR motifs) throughout the human and zebrafish <italic>Lrpprc</italic> models and numbered each starting from the N-termini of the proteins. Each hairpin of the -helix is believed to bind to a single nucleotide target. This analysis identified 34 and 31 PPR motifs in the human and zebrafish <italic>Lrpprc</italic> orthologs, respectively (Figure 2—figure supplement 1 and 2).</p><p>Analysis of these structures identified a series of standard PPR motifs and their resulting likely RNA-targeting amino acid side chains for sequence-specific interactions. Some PPR motifs of the human and zebrafish <italic>Lrpprc</italic> proteins were also noted to be less regular in form. For example, some motifs did not have obvious typical amino acids at the 5th and 35th positions to confer the nucleotide specificity and were longer or shorter than typical canonical PPR motifs. The resulting inferred consensus sequences (Figure 2—figure supplement 1 and 2) represent candidate RNA binding targets for these proteins.</p><p>To predict the potential transcripts bound by <italic>Lrpprc</italic> proteins, we took advantage of the recent development in executing the FIMO program to search the potential targets for several plant PPR proteins (21, 22). The predicted putative targets for human and zebrafish <italic>Lrpprc</italic> (Figure 2—figure supplement 1 and 2) were used to query the complete human and zebrafish mitochondrial transcriptomes, respectively. We identified several mitochondrial-encoded genes as targets using the FIMO motif search tool of the MEME Suite, and the top twenty hits with high confidence scores are listed in supplementary tables 1 and 2 for humans and zebrafish respectively. In addition, the structure of zebrafish <italic>Lrpprc</italic> protein revealed that the C-terminus half, which was deleted in the zebrafish GBT mutant allele, consisted of multiple PPR motifs for RNA-binding (Figure 2C and Figure 2—figure supplement 2).”</p><p>Discussion (pages 12-14; lines 298-376): “Zebrafish <italic>Lrpprc</italic> shares 51% homology with its human ortholog and has 31 predicted similar PPR domains indicating the conserved mitochondrial mRNA binding role of this gene. The spatiotemporal analysis of <italic>Lrpprc</italic>-mRFP shows a co-localization with an established mitochondrial marker in the caudal fin region and myocytes, as the truncated fusion proteins retain the mitochondrial targeting sequence maintaining its predicted subcellular localization. We also observed remarkable ubiquitous expression patterns throughout the organism and hotspots in the liver, skeletal muscle, and eye. In addition, increased expression of the fusion protein in certain tissues such as the liver, skeletal muscle, and eyes is indicative of the observation that mitochondrial density is tied to energy-intensive processes like metabolism, movement, and vision. Differential expression data will nevertheless help in expanding our understanding of the different roles of this gene in tissue-specific niches.</p><p>Sequence analysis of the predicted zebrafish <italic>Lrpprc</italic> protein revealed the presence of some known homology domains like secretory (SEC)1, RPN7, DUF2517, and EAD11. SEC1 homology domain-containing proteins are known to be involved in vesicular trafficking, synaptic transmission, and general secretion (8, 29). In addition, the human <italic>LRPPRC</italic> protein interacted with various other protein partners like fibronectin through its SEC1 domain (8). The effector-associated domains (EADs) are small, non-catalytic domains and are predicted to be involved in protein-protein interactions (30). The RPN7 domain is one of the regulatory subunits of the 26S proteasome and is known to be required for structural integrity in <italic>Saccharomyces cerevisiae</italic> (31). The region of zebrafish <italic>Lrpprc</italic> from amino acids 966 to 1012 had homology towards the protein of unknown function (DUF2517) domain, which is common to proteobacteria. The function of the DUF2517 homology domain is still unknown. Our in silico structural studies demonstrated that the C-terminus of human <italic>LRPPRC</italic> was well aligned with the C-terminus of zebrafish <italic>Lrpprc</italic> (Figure 2—figure supplement 3), strengthening the hypothesis that the zebrafish <italic>Lrpprc</italic> is playing a critical role in cell metabolism as discussed above. Additionally, the multiple sequence alignment of <italic>LRPPRC</italic> showed that the C-terminus region of this protein was conserved between several model organisms (Figure 2—figure supplement 3). Primary sequence and structural analyses highlighted the loss of domains important for maintaining the stability of mtRNA transcripts such as RPN7, DUF2517, SEC1, and EAD11 present in the C-terminus region of <italic>LRPPRC</italic> where a protein truncation led to LSFC-associated phenotype in zebrafish.</p><p>To understand the phenotypic and metabolic findings in the <italic>Lrpprc</italic>-deficient zebrafish model, we also analyzed the potential RNA binding targets of the <italic>Lrpprc</italic> protein. <italic>Lrpprc</italic> contains multiple PPR motifs, and these functional domains determine the target RNA binding sites. We first annotated the PPR motifs for the <italic>Lrpprc</italic> protein for zebrafish and human orthologs to explore RNA binding sites. Preliminary analysis using the TPRpred server identified 22 PPR motifs for both human and zebrafish <italic>Lrpprc</italic> proteins (22). TPRpred is a profile-based method that uses a P-value-dependent score offset and exploits the tendency of repeats to occur in tandem (32). This tool not only predicts the Tetratrico Peptide Repeat (TPR) motifs, but also the related PPRs and SEL1-like repeats. However, a study by Spåhr and colleagues had predicted 33 PPR motifs for the human <italic>LRPPRC</italic> protein (7) which was more than what was predicted by the TPRpred (32) server. Additionally, we evaluated the secondary structure containing the <italic>Lrpprc</italic> proteins by PSIPRED server, we found that both humans and zebrafish are all α-helical and may contain more hairpin of -helices than what TPRpred predicted. To address this discrepancy and to conduct a meticulous study to systematically identify PPR motifs in human and zebrafish <italic>Lrpprc</italic>, we employed a deep-learning-based structure modeling tool, RoseTTAFold (33). Using RoseTTAFold we designed a workflow to predict 31 and 34 PPR motifs for the zebrafish and human orthologs respectively of <italic>Lrpprc</italic> proteins.</p><p>We investigated the sequences of the identified PPR motifs in each of the orthologs and deciphered the RNA recognition residues, which are typically found at the 5th and 35th positions in each PPR motif. These two amino acids play a major role in specifying the target nucleotide and constitute a code for nucleotide recognition. The potential target recognition codes for human and zebrafish <italic>Lrpprc</italic> PPR motifs were predicted to exhibit a range of nucleotide targets (Figure 2—figure supplement 1 and 2). We used the FIMO search algorithm to predict the potential binding sites for human and zebrafish <italic>Lrpprc</italic> proteins. In silico RNA-binding analysis revealed that transcripts coding for proteins involved in the complex IV activity such as mt-co1 and mt-co2 were among the hits with a high confidence score. Apart from complex IV genes, transcripts belonging to complex I and complex V were also identified to be recognized by the PPR motifs of the <italic>Lrpprc</italic> protein. There was a consensus for the majority of the target transcripts for the zebrafish and human orthologs indicating a conserved function of <italic>Lrpprc</italic> in the maintenance of the mitochondrial genome both in humans and zebrafish. Previously, human <italic>LRPPRC</italic> was reported to regulate transcripts coding for complex IV of mitochondrial electron transport chain (34, 35) which was very well aligned with these findings and supports the hypothesis that both human and zebrafish <italic>LRPPRC</italic> likely have similar mitochondrial targets. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first such analysis that has been performed and validated for PPR-based proteins.</p><p>Previously published reports have highlighted the role of PPR-containing proteins in mediating mRNA stability and translational activation (36, 37). PPR proteins have been shown to stabilize the RNA structure by blocking the access to exonucleolytic cleavage upstream and downstream of their binding sites in a way acting as protein caps at the 5’ and 3’ ends of the processed transcripts (36). It also confers a site-specific remodeling activity by sequestering the target RNA by preventing it from binding to the translation initiation region (36). Another functionality contributed by this class of proteins is aiding in the inhibition of uridylation of A-tailed transcripts, thereby preventing the degradation of mRNAs (37). These roles highlight the role(s) of PPR motif-containing proteins in the stability of the mitochondrially encoded transcriptome.</p><p>Upon further investigation using independent transcriptomics sequencing and targeted mitochondrial RNA qPCR, it was observed that downregulated mtDNA genes in the <italic>Lrpprc</italic> homozygous zebrafish mutants overlapped with those predicted by the above algorithm. These results possibly explain the reduced expression of mitochondrial RNAs in the homozygous mutants, underscoring the role of <italic>Lrpprc</italic> as loss of this protein impedes the binding of this protein, therefore leading to mRNA instability and degradation.”</p><p>Discussion (pages 14-15; lines 384-392): “<italic>LRPPRC</italic> protein in mitochondria forms a complex with SRA stem-loop interacting RNA binding protein (SLIRP) protein in the mitochondrial matrix. The absence of <italic>LRPPRC</italic> leads to oligoadenylation of the transcripts. <italic>LRPPRC</italic>-SLIRP is also observed to relax RNA structure, making the 5' end of the mRNA accessible for the mitochondrial ribosome to initiate the translation (38). The mechanistic insights in our zebrafish <italic>in vivo</italic> model from the structure of <italic>Lrpprc</italic> protein and target sites of the predicted PPR domains as described earlier correlate with observations that have been well established in patient-derived cell culture model displaying the altered signature of mitochondrial transcripts (11, 23).”</p><p>Supplementary table 2 (page 49): “Prediction of Human <italic>LRPPRC</italic> binding sites within the human mitochondrial genome (NC_012920.1).

Mitochondrial morphology is a classical hallmark of underlying mitochondrial dysfunction. Mitochondria can undergo changes in shape accompanied by fusion and fission events which may involve remodeling at cristae junctions that dynamically appose and separate from each other. Under TEM, hepatic mitochondria had altered morphology with observed collapsed cristae in the homozygous mutants, potentially impairing mitochondrial function. From the transcript studies and motif-based target prediction, we did observe a decreased expression of <italic>mt-atp6</italic> and <italic>mt-atp8</italic> transcripts due to <italic>Lrpprc</italic> deficiency. Proteins coded by these mRNAs constitute the complex V of the electron transport chain. It has been reported that complex V plays an essential role in defining the cristae morphology specifically in the areas of high membrane curvature at cristae ridges. Addressing these comments, we have discussed this observation in the revised manuscript wherein we have highlighted how the abolishment of domains critical for mtRNA binding in <italic>Lrpprc</italic> can influence the stability of mitochondrial-encoded transcripts. Though, detailed experiments elucidating the molecular mechanisms of cristae remodeling are required to delve more into these hypotheses.</p><p>We have modified the text and discussed the above findings under the sections mentioned below in the revised manuscript:</p><p>Results (Page 11; lines 280-281): “Liver-specific rescue in the homozygous mutant background mostly reverted the mitochondrial morphology to an extent (Figure 7F).”</p><p>Discussion (Page 16; lines 439-448): “Mitochondrial morphology is the classical hallmark of underlying mitochondrial dysfunction.

Although we did observe that rescue was not completely reversible in the liver-specific Cre homozygous mutants. There may be several factors that can contribute to this observation such as incomplete penetrance or rescue of the mutant allele. As cristae are dynamic structures of mitochondria whose morphology is altered under various bioenergetics and physiological conditions (42, 43), reversion of mutagenicity cassette in the hepatocytes is not sufficient to correct cristae alterations that appeared to be aggravated in the <italic>Lrpprc</italic> homozygous mutants. A possible explanation for the restoration in the morphology may be attributed to the restoration of levels of mitochondrial transcripts and thus restoring mitochondrial-mediated liver functions such as β-oxidation and fatty acid elongation.”</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>5) The mechanism to control lipid metabolism was totally unknown.</p></disp-quote><p>We do appreciate the comment by the reviewer and during the revision of the manuscript, we did try to explore the retention of lipids in the homozygous mutants. As described in the previous version of the manuscript that oil red o staining in the <italic>Lrpprc</italic><sup>GBT0235/GBT0235</sup> mutants revealed an abnormal distribution of lipids with increased lipid accumulation in the livers of these animals, suggesting the observed darkened liver phenotype could be caused by a change in the density of the stored lipids. By coupling the feeding of a fluorescent fatty acid analog with high-performance liquid chromatography methods, triglycerides and diglycerides, the major components of nonpolar lipids along with cholesterol esters were observed to be higher in null mutants, highlighting the defect in fatty acid metabolism underscored by the accumulation of lipids observed by Oil Red O staining. These lipid metabolism defects were restored in liver-rescued zebrafish embryos (Tg(fabp10: Cre)/<italic>Lrpprc</italic><sup>GBT0235/GBT0235</sup>), shedding light on the liver as a major metabolic organ during the pathogenesis of LSFC.</p><p>To explore further explore the retention and sequestration of these synthesized triglycerides in the mutants, we fed them with lipid-rich egg yolk (Otis, J.

This would be intriguing to check for any lipid accumulation in the intestine suggesting non-cell-autonomous rescue. However, we didn’t see any observable difference in the lipid sequestration in the gut and intestine in the <italic>Lrpprc</italic> homozygous siblings as compared to their rescued mutants and wild-type siblings.</p><p>We do acknowledge that there is an interesting aspect of lipid biology that needs to be explored further in <italic>Lrpprc</italic> mutants.

After evaporation, the dry residue was silylated with N,O,-bis-(trimethylsilyl) trifluoroacetamide with 1% trimethylchlorosilane (BSTFA+TMCS). Subsequently, the reaction mixture was analyzed by capillary gas chromatography/mass spectrometry (GC/MS) (GC: Agilent 7890B Gas Chromatograph; mass spectrometer is an Agilent 5977A Mass Spectrometer, EI Source, and ionization) using selected ion monitoring (SIM) with positive electron impact ionization (EI) and stable isotope dilution. Peaks were acquired using Agilent Masshunter GC/MS Acquisition 10.0.368 and the software used for quantitation was Agilent Quantitative Analysis Masshunter Version 10.0.”</p><p>Results (page 8; lines 184-187): “Homozygous mutants were also interrogated to assess the levels of lactate, a clinical mitochondrial marker that is observed to be altered in patients presenting with LSFC symptoms.
