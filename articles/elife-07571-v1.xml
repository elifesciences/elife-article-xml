controlling their gene expression. However, the extent of genetic and associated epigenetic variation in the Treg cell lineage and its possible relation to disease states in humans remain unknown. We explored evolutionary conservation of regulatory elements and natural human inter-individual epigenetic variation in Treg cells to identify the core transcriptional control program of lineage specification. Analysis of single nucleotide polymorphisms in core lineage-specific enhancers revealed disease associations, which were further corroborated by high-resolution genotyping to fine map causal polymorphisms in lineage-specific enhancers. Our findings suggest that a small set of regulatory elements specify the Treg lineage and that genetic variation in Treg cell-specific enhancers may alter Treg cell function contributing to polygenic disease.</p><p><bold>DOI:</bold> <ext-link ext-link-type="doi" xlink:href="10.7554/eLife.07571.001">http://dx.doi.org/10.7554/eLife.07571.001</ext-link></p></abstract><abstract abstract-type="executive-summary"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.07571.002</object-id><title>eLife digest</title><p>The immune system protects the body from infection. Key to this protection is the ability to mount an immune response that is sufficient to deal with the threat, but is not so large that the damage it causes to the body exceeds its immediate benefit. Immune cells called regulatory T cells (or Treg cells for short) help to shut down the immune response after a threat has been successfully destroyed. They also prevent the immune system from attacking the body's own cells, a phenomenon known as autoimmunity.</p><p>All cells in the body carry the same set of genes, but the activity of these genes varies between cell types to enable the cells to perform their different jobs. This is possible because our DNA contains regions called regulatory elements that can control the expression of particular genes. These regions can be activated in specific types of cells, which results in specific chemical modifications to DNA that only affect gene activity in those cells.</p><p>The DNA sequences of these regulatory elements vary between individuals. This ‘genetic variation’ can lead to differences in the chemical modifications that occur to DNA, which is known as epigenetic variation. This means that Treg cells in one person may work in a different way to those in another individual, which could make some individuals more susceptible to autoimmune diseases than others. However, it was not clear how much genetic and epigenetic variation exists in Treg cells.</p><p>Here, Arvey et al. examined Treg and other immune cells from human and mouse donors. The experiments show that some of the epigenetic modifications present in many individuals only in Treg cells, which indicates that they may be important for the activity of the Treg cells. Unexpectedly, most of the epigenetic modifications were specific to either mice or humans, but Arvey et al. identified a core set of genes that had been modified only in Treg cells in both species. In the human cells, Arvey et al. also identified genetic differences in regulatory elements that are associated with autoimmune diseases.</p><p>Arvey et al.'s findings suggest that a small set of regulatory elements are crucial to the role of Treg cells in the immune system. Furthermore, genetic variation in these elements can lead to epigenetic changes in Treg cells that contribute to autoimmune diseases in humans. Further study may lead to the development of new treatments for these diseases.</p><p><bold>DOI:</bold> <ext-link ext-link-type="doi" xlink:href="10.7554/eLife.07571.002">http://dx.doi.org/10.7554/eLife.07571.002</ext-link></p></abstract><kwd-group kwd-group-type="author-keywords"><title>Author keywords</title><kwd>immunogenetics</kwd><kwd>regulatory T cell</kwd><kwd>immune regulation</kwd><kwd>epigenome</kwd><kwd>human</kwd><kwd>mouse</kwd></kwd-group><kwd-group kwd-group-type="research-organism"><title>Research organism</title><kwd>Human</kwd><kwd>Mouse</kwd></kwd-group><funding-group><award-group id="par-1"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000002</institution-id><institution>National Institutes of Health (NIH)</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>5R37AI034206</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Rudensky</surname><given-names>Alexander Y</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="par-2"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000011</institution-id><institution>Howard Hughes Medical Institute (HHMI)</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Rudensky</surname><given-names>Alexander Y</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="par-3"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000884</institution-id><institution>Cancer Research Institute (CRI)</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>Predoctoral Fellowship</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>van der Veeken</surname><given-names>Joris</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="par-4"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000054</institution-id><institution>National Cancer Institute (NCI)</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>P30 CA008748</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Rudensky</surname><given-names>Alexander Y</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="par-5"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000002</institution-id><institution>National Institutes of Health (NIH)</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>U01 HG007893</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Rudensky</surname><given-names>Alexander Y</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><funding-statement>The funders had no role in study design, data collection and interpretation, or the decision to submit the work for publication.</funding-statement></funding-group><custom-meta-group><custom-meta><meta-name>elife-xml-version</meta-name><meta-value>2.3</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta specific-use="meta-only"><meta-name>Author impact statement</meta-name><meta-value>There is limited epigenetic conservation of lineage-specific DNA elements in Treg cells, and genetic variation in Treg cell specific enhancers is associated with autoimmune disease.</meta-value></custom-meta></custom-meta-group></article-meta></front><body><sec id="s1" sec-type="intro"><title>Introduction</title><p>Lineage specification factors promote cellular differentiation by binding DNA regulatory elements to stably alter the local chromatin state and affect gene transcriptional outputs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib60">Visel et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib53">Thurman et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">Nord et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib42">Ostuni et al., 2013</xref>). Since the majority of protein-coding genome sequence is under constraint, due to the cost of deleterious mutational perturbations in protein function, changes in non-coding regulatory portions of the genome are thought to serve as a major source of evolutionary innovation and substrates for selection (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">King and Wilson, 1975</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib49">Schmidt et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Goncalves et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib62">Ward and Kellis, 2012</xref>). Histone modifications and chromatin accessibility, which serve as proxies for epigenetic transcriptional control, can exhibit conservation shared with the underlying genetic elements in a given cell lineage across species and within the genetically diverse human population (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Kasowski et al., 2013a</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Kilpinen et al., 2013a</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Long et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">McVicker et al., 2013a</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib52">Stergachis et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib59">Vierstra et al., 2014</xref>). However, it remains unknown if changes in the chromatin state of regulatory elements associated with cell lineage specification are conserved in their lineage-specificity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">Odom et al., 2007</xref>). That is, it is unknown to what extent regulatory elements are cell lineage-specific across multiple organisms and individuals. Strong conservation would imply that the differentiation process of a specialized cell population is highly constrained at a genomic level, whereas extensive variation would suggest that lineage specification is dependent on only a few immutable genetic regulatory elements.</p><p>We examined conservation of chromatin states and gene expression in human and mouse regulatory T (Treg) cells, a key cell population required for maintenance of tolerance to ‘self’ and restrained inflammatory responses during infection. Treg cell differentiation and function is controlled by a late-acting lineage specification factor Foxp3, which is induced upon signaling through T cell (TCR) and cytokine receptors (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Hill et al., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">Ohkura et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib45">Samstein et al., 2012</xref>). Treg cells generated in the thymus exhibit a ‘naive’ phenotype and display low, if any suppressor activity in contrast to activated Treg cells, which acquire highly potent suppressor function as the result of TCR signaling-dependent activation and division (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Battaglia and Roncarolo, 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Levine et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib57">Vahl et al., 2014</xref>). Genetic Foxp3 deficiency or elimination of Treg cells in mice results in lymphoproliferation and myeloproliferation leading to widespread fatal autoimmune lesions largely driven by activation of ‘self’-, commensal microbiota-, and food-derived antigen-reactive CD4 T cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Brunkow et al., 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Fontenot et al., 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Khattri et al., 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Kim et al., 2007</xref>).

The analysis of orthologous lineage-specific epigenetic features revealed that while the vast majority of regulatory loci were genetically conserved, the lineage-specific epigenome was markedly different in mouse and human, supporting a model whereby few conserved elements contribute to the specification of the Treg cell lineage. A subset of the conserved lineage-specific elements contained nucleotide polymorphisms associated with altered epigenetic activity in human Treg cells isolated from a small cohort of healthy donors. Finally, we analyzed the polymorphic conserved elements using high-resolution epigenetic and genome-wide genetic disease association data and were able to localize disease-risk linked polymorphisms to regulatory loci that are exclusively epigenetically active in Treg cells. Our results support a role for Treg dysfunction in common polygenic diseases.</p></sec><sec id="s2" sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><sec id="s2-1"><title>Genetic and epigenetic conservation of regulatory non-coding DNA elements between human and mouse CD4<sup>+</sup> T-cell lineages</title><p>To characterize the epigenetic state of human Treg and CD4<sup>+</sup> T-cell populations, we isolated CD4<sup>+</sup> T cells from the peripheral blood of individual anonymous human donors using negative selection (see ‘Materials and methods’). Previously characterized subsets of Treg cells and naive and effector CD4<sup>+</sup> T cells were purified using FACS sorting based on expression of CD25 and CD45RO (&gt;97–99% purity) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1A–C</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1A,B</xref>).

We desired to compare aTreg vs Teff in addition to Treg vs Tn cell populations, since they have comparable antigen experience; however, human and mouse T-cell subsets isolated ex vivo may have experienced different in vivo activation conditions. Therefore, we compared activated Treg lineage-specific transcriptional and epigenetic features to those of conventional T effector populations for each organism to account for the species-specific activation associated changes. In total, we analyzed 16 human cell samples (7 donors: 7 aTreg, 4 rTreg, 2 Teff, 2 Tmem, and 1 Tn samples) and 10 murine samples (2 aTreg, 4 rTreg, 2 Teff, and 4 Tn biological replicates independently isolated from different mice).<fig-group><fig id="fig1" position="float"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.07571.003</object-id><label>Figure 1.</label><caption><title>Analysis of genetic and epigenetic conservation in mouse and human Treg and CD4<sup>+</sup> T cell subsets.</title><p>(<bold>A</bold>) Schematic representation of profiled CD4<sup>+</sup> T-cell subsets.

Thus, we examined all regulatory elements associated with a given gene (most proximal gene body) to see if a lineage-specific regulatory element in mouse could ‘re-emerge’ in a different location as a non-homologous lineage-specific regulatory element in human. This definition could be considered ‘functional homology’ in contrast to our previous analyses that have focused on individually conserved regulatory elements. Interestingly, this and other functional definitions of lineage-specific conservation (see ‘Materials and methods’) yielded very few additional genes (statistically non-significant gene counts, see ‘Materials and methods’), nearly all of which had non-conserved gene expression patterns in Treg vs conventional CD4<sup>+</sup> T cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s2">Figure 2—figure supplement 2</xref>).

While early GWA genotyping approaches were too coarse to localize the causative polymorphism, fine mapping by the ImmunoChip across a large case–control T1D cohort demonstrated that the most disease-associated variants, represented by rs2882971, lie within Treg cell-specific enhancers that are epigenetically conserved and lineage-specific in both human and mouse (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5A</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s1">Figure 2—figure supplement 1A</xref>) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib40">Onengut-Gumuscu et al., 2015</xref>).

Pairwise conditioning of rs2882971 and rs3087243 resulted in a non-statistically significant association for both polymorphisms (logistic regression for an additive model yielded SNP coefficient p-values that were greater than 0.05).

To isolate biologically important elements, conservation of genetic DNA sequence and epigenetic activity has been used as a proxy for functional significance (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">Odom et al., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib49">Schmidt et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Long et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib59">Vierstra et al., 2014</xref>). We compared genome-wide features of regulatory elements and their activity in two closely related cell lineages, Treg cells, and effector CD4<sup>+</sup> T cells, which represent alternative cell fate choices during T-cell differentiation and fulfill opposing anti-inflammatory and pro-inflammatory immune functions. In our comparison of Treg and effector T-cell lineages, we found that ∼85% of regulatory elements were genetically conserved and epigenetically active in both human and mouse, ∼1–2% were lineage-specific in human or mouse, and &lt;0.1% were lineage-specific in both human and mouse. This indicates that of those elements that are specific to the Treg lineage, less than 10% were lineage-specific in both mouse and human. Thus, the bulk of lineage-specific epigenetic activity was unique to each organism with only a small set of conserved Treg lineage defining regulatory elements, including enhancers near <italic>FOXP3</italic>, <italic>IL2RA</italic>, <italic>LRRC32</italic>, <italic>IKZF2</italic>, <italic>IL2</italic>, <italic>IL7R</italic>, and <italic>PDE3B</italic>.

These findings suggest that lineage specification programs may be dependent on but a few immutable genetic regulatory elements, while tolerating considerable epigenetic variation at numerous additional organism-specific lineage-specific elements.</p><p>Given previous findings regarding the extensive turnover of DNA elements in genome-wide regulatory networks (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib52">Stergachis et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib59">Vierstra et al., 2014</xref>), it is noteworthy that we found limited turnover of regulatory elements that are lineage-specific in both mouse and human. This confirms the unique importance of these individual regulatory elements. However, our observation that many lineage-specific regulatory elements are lineage-specific in only a single organism highlights the plasticity of genome-wide regulatory networks. Furthermore, we found that the Foxp3-mediated transcriptional control program was subject to forkhead-binding motif ‘turnover’ that was associated with functional consequences. While these organism-specific elements contributed to gene regulation, the regulatory elements with conserved lineage-specific epigenetic activity were associated with far more pronounced regulation of Treg cell lineage-specific gene expression.</p><p>Although our studies support a role for Treg cell dysfunction in disease pathogenesis, other factors are almost certainly required, such as environmental contributors and dysfunction of multiple other cell lineages and physiological processes. For instance, it is reasonable to consider that autoimmune diabetes development is impacted most significantly by HLA risk alleles (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib64">Wong et al., 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib51">Stadinski et al., 2010</xref>), and to a lesser degree by other susceptibility determinants including potentially compromised Treg cells. Though, we observed statistical enrichment of risk alleles near Treg cell enhancers, it is worth noting that the majority of polymorphisms exist as broad haplotype blocks that cannot be perfectly resolved to a single or several lineage-specific enhancers. Although methods for parsing risk alleles into causative and specific cell lineages have been proposed (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">Maurano et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib55">Trynka et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Farh et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib50">Seumois et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib40">Onengut-Gumuscu et al., 2015</xref>), these approaches, similar to our study, rely on aggregate proximity statistics and imperfect modeling of genetic linkage. As whole genome sequencing and mappings of epigenetic activity improve and expand to more cell populations (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Epigenome Roadmap Consortium, 2015</xref>), we expect a significant fraction of loci will have clear epigenetic partitioning in many diseases. We propose that for those risk alleles without clear causative polymorphism due to broad linkage disequilibrium, hypothesis-driven lineage-focused epigenomic QTL studies may be an alternative for gaining increased resolution of disease causing polymorphisms.</p><p>Our study suggests that the vast majority of Treg cell lineage-specific elements are not conserved between mice and humans suggesting that during cellular differentiation, only a handful of epigenetic elements implement the core transcriptional program that underlies establishment of a differentiated Treg cell identity and function. In support of this model, disease-associated polymorphisms clustered at genic loci containing core lineage-specific epigenetic elements. Nevertheless, most Treg lineage-specific regulatory elements were lineage-specific only in human and could harbor extensive natural genetic variation that could influence transcription, alter cellular function, and contribute to polygenic disease. This orthogonal high-resolution epigenetic and genetic analysis enabled characterization of disease-predisposing genetic variation associated with Treg-specific enhancers, and therefore, implicated Treg cells in complex autoimmune disease.</p></sec><sec id="s4" sec-type="materials|methods"><title>Materials and methods</title><sec id="s4-1"><title>Cell isolation</title><p>Buffy coat preparations from normal human peripheral blood donors were obtained from the New York Blood Center (NYBC) on same day as donation.

Conserved epigenetic activity was quantified as follows. After matching human-to-mouse loci, we then mapped all mouse-to-human elements and took the union of all elements in each species, respectively. Raw read counts were mapped to the union set of all genetically conserved regulatory elements and non-genetically conserved loci were set to zero. For analysis of gene-level conservation (e.g., gene expression), human HUGO gene names were mapped to murine gene names by Mouse ENCODE mapping (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib67">Yue et al., 2014</xref>).</p></sec><sec id="s4-5"><title>Quantifying mobility and function of lineage-specific regulatory elements</title><p>To test for mobility (since individual regulatory elements may be active in both mouse and human, but be lineage-specific only in a single organism, we determined if lineage-specific regulatory elements appear as an independent regulatory elements near the same gene) of lineage-specific epigenetic elements within a genic locus (defined as the closest gene transcription start site (TSS) and genes within 100 kbp), we addressed the following questions: (1) Is there mobility of lineage-specific epigenetic elements within a locus? (2) Do lineage-specific epigenetic elements become epigenetically active, but lineage non-specific, conserved genetic elements? (3) Would loosening of cutoffs for lineage-specificity and taking the maximally lineage-specific element across a large locus reveal conservation of the lineage specification program across non-conserved regulatory elements?</p><p>For (1), we identified genic loci that contained movement of lineage-specific epigenetic elements in mouse and human (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s2">Figure 2—figure supplement 2D</xref>, example shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s2">Figure 2—figure supplement 2A</xref>). Gene expression was concordant for 3/45 elements examined (not statistically significant).</p><p>For (2), a handful of lineage-specific elements became epigenetically inactive in the other organism (&lt;15, not statistically significant) and had limited lineage-specific gene expression (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s2">Figure 2—figure supplement 2E</xref>).</p><p>For (3), loosened rank cutoffs identified weakly lineage-specific elements in human (n = 632/496, up/down) and mouse (n = 759/625, up/down) at proximal but not necessarily orthogonal gene loci. Nearby genes were largely unaffected or exhibited discordant lineage-specific gene expression, indicating that this set may have limited functional relevance. Nearby genes with weak levels of differential expression (&gt;0.5-fold or <italic>q</italic> &lt; 0.01, where <italic>q</italic> is false discovery rate (FDR) value) are shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s2">Figure 2—figure supplement 2F</xref> (n = 26 up; n = 22 down), which includes many genes with regulatory elements that are lineage specific in both mouse and human as characterized in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s2">Figure 2—figure supplement 2C</xref>.</p></sec><sec id="s4-6"><title>SNP genotype calling</title><p>Genotype calling was performed according to best practices described by the Broad Institute Genome Analysis Tool Kit v3.1.1 (GATK) documentation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">DePristo et al., 2011</xref>). We used Picard (v0.92) to designate read groups by donor and cell type. Potentially monoclonal reads were removed by selecting a single read at random for each position in the genome with multiple read start sites (custom Python script). This strategy avoids reference alignment bias of other tools (e.g., samtools rmdup) that select reads with maximum alignment score. The standard GATK pipeline was used to perform local realignment around potential indels and recalibrate quality scores across experiments. Final calling and estimation of allelic read depth were performed using the Unified Genotyper algorithm on variants compiled in dbSNP (v138). Variant calling quality was assessed by the Variant Recalibrator algorithm using HapMap 3.3, 1000G Project, and dbSNP v138 as calibrating resources for estimating sensitivity and specificity of calls. Low-quality tranches were discarded and not considered in downstream analyses.</p></sec><sec id="s4-7"><title>Allele-specific chromatin modifications</title><p>Heterozygous SNPs were identified using GATK (see above).

Two-tailed binomial tests for allelic imbalance was used to filter all heterozygous polymorphisms with p-values &gt; 0.2, as these provide little evidence for allele-specific enhancer usage. Remaining polymorphisms were aggregated into H3K27ac regulatory elements and tested for LD <italic>r</italic><sup><italic>2</italic></sup> &gt; 0.99 in the five 1000G populations AFR, EUR, CEU, CHB, and JPT. These polymorphisms were then aggregated for each regulatory element, under the assumption of allelic read depth independence. This statistic was then analyzed for divergence from an empirical null distribution constructed by random uniform p-value aggregation under identical assumptions. This is shown in the QQ-plot of <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s1">Figure 4—figure supplement 1E</xref>.</p><p>Since B lymphoblastoid cell lines (B-LCL) share many regulatory elements with CD4<sup>+</sup> T cells, we performed meta-analysis with the inclusion of the B-LCL data sets (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Kasowski et al., 2013a</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">McVicker et al., 2013a</xref>) to increase confidence in shared allele-specific chromatin expression alleles (e.g., <italic>ENTPD1</italic> as shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4</xref>). Additionally, a small set of loci presented allele-specific modifications in only CD4<sup>+</sup> T cells (e.g., <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s1">Figure 4—figure supplement 1F</xref>); however, our analysis was underpowered to detect such events genome-wide.</p><p>A test of allelic preference across both homozygous and heterozygous individuals was performed on normalized estimates of read count coverage of a given genotype. That is, reads with a given genotype were quantified by RPM. Heterozygous RPM values were doubled to make them comparable to homozygous RPM values. These were then mean-normalized by data set (LCL and primary T cells). Statistical test of allele specificity incorporating homozygous individuals was performed using two approaches: (1) independent test of heterozygous and homozygous individuals and (2) linear regression across all genotypes. For (1), test of heterozygous allele specificity is described above and quantitative differences in H3K27ac across homozygous individuals was estimated by t-test. As homozygous and heterozygous individuals represent independent observations, the product of p-values was used as an estimate of statistical significance of allele specificity. For (2), linear regression of normalized RPM values to major allele counts was modified to include values for the two heterozygous read overlap counts, shifting the regression domain from {0, 1, 2} to {0, 1, 2, 3}, where 0, 3 are homozygous and 1, 2 are the respective heterozygous regressor values.</p></sec><sec id="s4-8"><title>Analysis of epigenetic association with disease-risk SNPs</title><p>Polymorphisms identified in prior GWA studies were obtained from the NHGRI GWAS Catalog (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib63">Welter et al., 2014</xref>) (downloaded 12 April, 2014). At this time, the catalog was in hg18 coordinates, which were converted to hg19 coordinates using the liftOver program and UCSC whole genome lift over chains. These polymorphisms were then analyzed for overlap with regions surrounding regulatory elements using the hypergeometric overlap test. Our analysis crudely corrected for linkage disequilibrium, which has confounded significance statistics in previous studies (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">Maurano et al., 2012</xref>), by taking broad 100 kbp regions (or most proximal gene body) surrounding regulatory elements to include disease-associated polymorphisms across the haplotype block. This empirically eliminated over-counting events arising from multiple epigenetic elements overlapping a single genetic haplotype.

Your article has been evaluated by Mark McCarthy (Senior editor) and three reviewers, one of whom is a member of our Board of Reviewing Editors.</p><p>The manuscript by Arvey et al. explores genetic and epigenetic variation in the lineage specification of regulatory T cells. A comparison is made of various mouse and human T helper cell populations using H3K27ac as a surrogate of active regulatory elements. The studies are of interest because of the key roles of Treg cells in control of immune function and autoimmunity. There were divergent opinions among the reviewers as to the suitability of this manuscript for publication in <italic>eLife</italic> that related to the extent to which it represents a conceptual advance. There were also concerns that many aspects of the manuscript are insufficiently documented and difficult to follow. After considerable discussion among the reviewers, a decision was made to allow consideration of a revised manuscript that fully addresses the main concerns. The consensus was that this could not be accomplished in the form of a short report due to the requirement to provide more detail and that the revised manuscript would have to be expanded to a full article rather than a short report.</p><p>Essential revisions:</p><p>1) A major motivation of this work is based on the statement, ‘it remains unknown if changes in the chromatin state of regulatory elements associated with cell lineage specification are conserved in their lineage-specificity’. However, this precise question was the major focus of Stergachis et al. Nature 515, 356-70, 2014. The Stergachis et al. paper, which is not cited, systematically analyzed the cis-acting circuitry of a large number of mouse and human cell types. A main point of Stergachis et al., is that while the precise genomic sequences containing cis regulatory elements for key transcription factors may not be conserved, the higher level organization of transcriptional networks is highly conserved. Although not the main focus of the paper, Treg cells are included in this analysis in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3 fig4 fig5">Figures 3–5</xref>. The methods differ in that Stergachis et al. primarily rely on DNase hypersensitivity, which indicates TF binding, whereas the current manuscript uses H3K27ac to identify regions of regulatory activity. The current findings may be fully consistent with those of Stergachis, but at this point it is not clear the conclusion in the Abstract that ‘our findings suggest that a small set of regulatory elements specify the Treg lineage’ is correct. This conclusion is drawn from the data shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s1">Figure 2–figure supplement 1</xref>, and is based on the relatively limited set of ‘conserved’ elements. These studies do not exclude the possibility that there are many non-conserved elements (that may represent conserved functional modules in different genomic locations) that are important for expression of Treg-specific genes. The authors will need to directly compare and contrast their findings and conclusions with those of Stergachis et al. with respect to the point of whether a small set of regulatory elements is sufficient to specify the Treg lineage.</p><p>2) Many of the figure panels in this manuscript are hard to interpret, and are inadequately explained in the legends. Specific examples of this are detailed in ‘Additional concerns’. Secondly, the Methods section does not give enough detail about the analyses that were performed to explain how certain numbers were arrived at. There needs to be more detail about what computational processes and parameters were used. Ideally, code would be provided as well to enable thorough review of what is largely a data-analysis, rather than data-generation, paper. Thirdly, many of the claims relied on single examples, and many figures lacked sufficient numerical or statistical underpinnings. Also, there should be more discussion about the relationship between this analysis and the results in <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">King and Wilson, 1975</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Goncalves et al., 2012</xref> and <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib62">Ward and Kellis, 2012</xref>.</p><p>3) <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2BC</xref> show that only a few genes show correlation between K27 levels in human and mouse, and only a few genes show correlation in expression between human and mouse. It would seem that a listing of the genes in common between these two analyses would make the analysis much more meaningful.</p><p>4) <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2E</xref> is a very strong demonstration that sites bound by Foxp3 only in human Treg cells lost H3K27ac only in humans, and conversely sites bound by Foxp3 only in mice lost H3K27 only in mice. In conserved sites both human and mice lost H3K27ac. This appears to support the notion that Foxp3 is associated with repression, but there is no comment on this. Would the authors discuss?</p><p>5) <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3C</xref> expounds on the ENTPD1 gene encoding the ectonucleoside triphosphate diphosphohydrolase, CD39. They show and state, “<italic>ENTPD1</italic> locus demonstrated genetic association with H3K27ac levels across individuals and in an allele-specific manner in a given individual (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3C,D</xref>).” The odd thing about this is that CD39 is ubiquitously expressed in virtually all tissues. Although the authors show an association with H3K27 levels, they did not show whether this translated into changes in gene expression. I would think the authors should address this issue, especially as CD39 is so widely expressed.</p><p>6) <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3D</xref> shows the K27ac reads associated with two alleles in the same individual, which is a nice analysis; however, do the points represent individual people? How many are people, and how many are lymphoblastoid lines? Is this a fair aggregation of data? Does the p-value listed refer to the difference in alleles? From the looks of the data, I wouldn't have expected a p value of 10^-13.</p><p>7) The conclusion that DNA polymorphisms in Treg-specific noncoding regulatory sites are enriched for association with autoimmune disease is not fully convincing. The association of these polymorphisms with total CD4<sup>+</sup> T cell noncoding regulatory sites is far more impressive. Treg cells are a subset of CD4<sup>+</sup> cells, and a “devil's advocate” would raise the question of whether Tregs might even be less likely than other types of CD4<sup>+</sup> T cells to have their specific regulatory elements contribute to disease. The association is stated without discussing real alternatives in this version of the manuscript. Is the right null hypothesis being tested in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3G</xref>?</p><p>8) The figures do not explicitly show much evidence for a disease association among the Treg-specific enhancers. There is differential H3K27 acetylation, but the Venn diagrams shown seem to indicate that only a few Treg-specific elements are found among the many disease-associated SNPs. Is the Treg-specific element containing a SNP at the ENTPD1 locus disease-associated?</p><p>9) It seems surprising to use enhancer activity marks in the B lymphoblastoid cell lines as an additional source of statistical power for Treg-specific enhancers, e.g. in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3D</xref> and elsewhere as described in Methods (under “Allele-specific chromatin modifications”). What does this statement mean? These marks should generally be cell type specific.</p><p>10) Legend to <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s1">Figure 3–figure supplement 1E</xref>: For interested biologists in the readership, explain what a Q–Q plot is and what the axes represent.

(Nature, 2014). We focus exclusively on the small number of lineage-specific regulatory elements and the conservation of their lineage specificity. In contrast, Stergachis et al. present conclusions regarding genome-wide transcriptional control programs of hundreds of transcription factors inferred from DNase footprints. Since we focus on the small number of lineage-specific elements, we are not able to perform the type of analysis reported by Stergachis et al., which requires aggregation across thousands of regulatory elements to achieve sufficient statistical power and biological robustness.</p><p>Nevertheless, to address the question of “can individual cell lineage-specific regulatory elements be non-conserved while enabling a similar conserved regulatory network”, we were able to examine the rate at which lineage-specific regulatory elements are lost and/or re-appear as independent regulatory elements near the same gene. This analysis involved three questions regarding “movement” of lineage-specific epigenetic elements within a genic locus, which we defined as the closest gene TSS and genes within 100kbp: (1) Is there mobility of lineage-specific epigenetic elements within a locus? (2) Do lineage-specific epigenetic elements become epigenetically active, but lineage non-specific, conserved genetic elements? (3) Would loosening of cutoffs for lineage-specificity and taking the maximally lineage-specific element across a large locus reveal conservation of the lineage specification program across non-conserved regulatory elements?</p><p>For (1), we identified genic loci that contained movement of lineage-specific epigenetic elements in mouse and human (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s2">Figure 2–figure supplement 2D</xref>, example shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s2">Figure 2–figure supplement 2A</xref>). Gene expression was concordant for 3/45 elements examined (not statistically significant).</p><p>For (2), a handful of lineage-specific elements became epigenetically inactive in the other organism (&lt;15, not statistically significant) and had limited lineage-specific gene expression (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s2">Figure 2–figure supplement 2E</xref>).</p><p>For (3), loosened rank cutoffs identified weakly lineage-specific elements in human (n = 632/496, up/down) and mouse (n = 759/625, up/down) at proximal but not necessarily orthogonal gene loci. Nearby genes were largely unaffected or exhibited discordant lineage-specific gene expression, indicating that this set may have limited functional relevance. Nearby genes with weak levels of differential expression (&gt;0.5-fold or q &lt; 0.01, where q is FDR value) are shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s2">Figure 2–figure supplement 2F</xref> (n = 26 up; n = 22 down), which includes many genes with regulatory elements that are lineage specific in both mouse and human as characterized in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s2">Figure 2–figure supplement 2C</xref>.</p><p>We now include these analyses as a new supplemental figure (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s2">Figure 2–figure supplement 2</xref>) and describe these results in the text.

An example where a single example is employed is in the context of linking Treg cells with disease through epigenetic overlap with GWA study significant SNP associations. The single example proof of concept at CTLA4 (now <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5A</xref>) demonstrates that a cluster of disease-associated polymorphisms are found in Treg lineage-specific enhancers, which acts as both an example and as proof of concept that if the polymorphisms in this cluster are functionally altering disease course, than they most likely do so through differential Treg cell function.

Additionally, the epigenetic and genetic structure at the locus makes it challenging to characterize cell-intrinsic contributions to disease (also discussed in response to points 5 and 9 above).
