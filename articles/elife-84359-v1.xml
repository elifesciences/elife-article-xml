hippocampus and cortex, and the emergence of cortical traces that reflect overlap across memories. However, there is limited empirical evidence that links these mechanisms to the emergence of behavioral integration over time. In two experiments, participants implicitly encoded sequences of objects with overlapping structure. Assessment of behavioral integration showed that response times during a recognition task reflected behavioral priming between objects that never occurred together in time but belonged to overlapping sequences. This priming was consolidation-dependent and only emerged for sequences learned 24 hr prior to the test. Critically, behavioral integration was related to changes in neural pattern similarity in the medial prefrontal cortex and increases in post-learning rest connectivity between the posterior hippocampus and lateral occipital cortex. These findings suggest that memories with a shared predictive structure become behaviorally integrated through a consolidation-related restructuring of the learned sequences, providing insight into the relationship between different consolidation mechanisms that support behavioral integration.</p></abstract><kwd-group kwd-group-type="author-keywords"><kwd>episodic memory</kwd><kwd>fMRI</kwd><kwd>systems consolidation</kwd></kwd-group><kwd-group kwd-group-type="research-organism"><title>Research organism</title><kwd>Human</kwd></kwd-group><funding-group><award-group id="fund1"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000025</institution-id><institution>National Institute of Mental Health</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>MH074692</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Davachi</surname><given-names>Lila</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund2"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution>Dart Neuroscience</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Davachi</surname><given-names>Lila</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund3"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000001</institution-id><institution>National Science Foundation</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>GRFP</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Tompary</surname><given-names>Alexa</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><funding-statement>The funders had no role in study design, data collection, and interpretation, or the decision to submit the work for publication.</funding-statement></funding-group><custom-meta-group><custom-meta specific-use="meta-only"><meta-name>Author impact statement</meta-name><meta-value>Changes in cortical neural ensembles and heightened coupling between the hippocampus and cortex enable the eventual behavioral integration of memories with overlapping sequential information.</meta-value></custom-meta></custom-meta-group></article-meta></front><body><sec id="s1" sec-type="intro"><title>Introduction</title><p>There are now abundant demonstrations that after periods involving consolidation, episodic memories undergo transformations that allow individuals to integrate across overlapping experiences. Examples of enhanced behavioral integration with consolidation include transitive inference (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib43">Ellenbogen et al., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib72">Lau et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib132">Werchan and Gómez, 2013</xref>), the extraction of statistical regularities (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib129">Wagner et al., 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib41">Durrant et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib41">Durrant et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib112">Sweegers et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Batterink and Paller, 2017</xref>), category learning (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">Djonlagic et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib51">Graveline and Wamsley, 2017</xref>), and more (for reviews, see <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Chatburn et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib73">Lerner and Gluck, 2019</xref>). What neural transformations support such consolidation-dependent integration across experiences?</p><p>Theories of systems-level consolidation posit that memories initially supported by the hippocampus become distributed across the cortex, through ongoing, coordinated reactivation of prior experiences (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib87">Nadel et al., 2000</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib111">Squire et al., 1984</xref>). Through this reactivation, the memory traces that are ultimately learned by cortex are thought to be highly structured and integrated representations built up from many overlapping experiences (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib77">McClelland et al., 1995</xref>). One class of theories posits that <italic>neural</italic> integration is accompanied by a psychological transformation such that memories supported by cortex are more gist-like and reflect the shared aspects across multiple events (Trace Transformation Theory (TTT); <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib106">Sekeres et al., 2018a</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib134">Winocur et al., 2010</xref>). Thus, systems-level consolidation theories point to two neural mechanisms that could support such time-dependent <italic>behavioral</italic> integration of overlapping memories: (1) coordinated reactivation of memory traces between the hippocampus and cortex after learning, and (2) the emergence of cortical memory traces that reflect shared content across memories for different but overlapping events. However, evidence for this is limited and, thus, it is unclear whether and how these two mechanisms may jointly support the behavioral integration of overlapping experiences. Here, we present a new behavioral protocol to probe the implicit integration of events with overlapping content, and we use this protocol to investigate how cortical similarity and post-learning hippocampal–cortical coupling interact in supporting consolidation-dependent behavioral integration in humans.</p><sec id="s1-1"><title>Integration and cortical similarity</title><p>According to TTT, the <italic>behavioral</italic> integration of related memories should be supported by the <italic>neural</italic> integration of cortical memory traces that reflects their overlap. Previous work has already pointed to medial prefrontal cortex (mPFC) as a key cortical region supporting integrated memories that emerge without the aid of consolidation. For instance, damage to this region impairs key memory integration behaviors like associative inference in humans (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib66">Koscik and Tranel, 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib110">Spalding et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib131">Warren et al., 2014</xref>) and transitive inference in rodents (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">DeVito et al., 2010</xref>). Furthermore, activation of this region and its connectivity with the hippocampus increases when encoding episodes containing stimuli that overlap with recently learned information (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib68">Kuhl et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib104">Schlichting and Preston, 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib138">Zeithamova et al., 2012</xref>), providing convincing evidence of its role in memory integration. Of particular relevance to the current study, patterns of activity in mPFC become more correlated for events linked through overlapping elements (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib103">Schlichting et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib80">Milivojevic et al., 2015</xref>) and also carry information about the common structure across many learned relationships (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib83">Morton et al., 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib105">Schuck et al., 2016</xref>). With converging evidence spanning multiple species and methods is clear that mPFC supports the acquisition and immediate expression of integrated memories.</p><p>However, there is much less evidence in humans that the neural representations in mPFC are predictive of behavioral measures of memory integration over the course of systems-level consolidation, despite such strong behavioral evidence of consolidation-dependent behavioral integration (e.g. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Chatburn et al., 2014</xref>) and the increasing involvement of mPFC in memory retrieval over time (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Bonnici et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib50">Frankland et al., 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib114">Takashima et al., 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib116">Takashima et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib117">Takehara-Nishiuchi and McNaughton, 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib135">Woodard et al., 2007</xref>). In other words, a direct link between the two is lacking. There are some clues that such a relationship should exist. First, in rodents, neural ensembles in mPFC become more selective for common features across two different associative memories and less selective to features unique to each (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib82">Morrissey et al., 2017</xref>). Second, there is evidence of delay-dependent changes in the content of memories in human mPFC (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib107">Sekeres et al., 2018b</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib67">Krenz et al., 2023</xref>). Third, there is evidence for neural integration of related memories in this region. Previously, we used a multi-variate pattern similarity approach to demonstrate that after a week, neural patterns during the retrieval of overlapping memories grew more correlated (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib122">Tompary and Davachi, 2017</xref>). <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Audrain and McAndrews, 2022</xref> observed a similar increase in correlation of overlapping memories over time in mPFC, although with notable differences in their protocol and consequent findings (see Discussion). However, as neither group measured the <italic>behavioral</italic> integration across those overlapping memories, the link between these time-dependent neural transformations and behavioral integration remains unknown. Thus, despite its theorized role in the expression of behaviorally integrated memories over time (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib92">Preston and Eichenbaum, 2013</xref>), to our knowledge, no other human research has examined how consolidation may organize memory traces in mPFC to support their behavioral integration.</p></sec><sec id="s1-2"><title>Integration and hippocampal–cortical coupling</title><p>Another fundamental component of systems-level consolidation theories is the coordinated reactivation of memory traces between the hippocampus and cortex after learning. One way to operationalize such post-learning coordination is by measuring changes in the the correlation of their blood oxygenation level dependent (BOLD) signals during resting-state functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) after encoding new memoranda (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib118">Tambini et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib127">van Kesteren et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib121">Tompary et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">de Voogd et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib54">Gruber et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib104">Schlichting and Preston, 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib85">Murty et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib75">Liu et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib120">Tambini and D’Esposito, 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Audrain and McAndrews, 2022</xref>). While hippocampal–cortical coupling is not a direct measure of the reactivation of specific memories, memory-related patterns of coupling are specific to category-selective cortical regions (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">de Voogd et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib85">Murty et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib128">Vilberg and Davachi, 2013</xref>) and emerge only in post-learning rest periods rather than pre-learning ones, making rest connectivity a likely signature of coordinated reactivation across hippocampus and cortex (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib119">Tambini and Davachi, 2019</xref>). The vast majority of studies investigating post-learning rest connectivity find that the magnitude of experience-dependent change relates to subsequent memory accuracy, with the exception of one demonstration that post-learning connectivity relates to explicit associative inference (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib104">Schlichting and Preston, 2016</xref>). To our knowledge, this is the only finding that relates post-learning rest connectivity to a measure of behavioral integration rather than memory accuracy of learned items, but it does not examine consolidation-related changes as the integration test was administered a few minutes after learning. Furthermore, while a handful of studies reveal relationships between post-learning rest connectivity and the neural integration of overlapping memories (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib122">Tompary and Davachi, 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Audrain and McAndrews, 2022</xref>), none to our knowledge has examined how these neural measures, jointly or separately, support behavioral integration. This leaves open the fundamental question of whether post-learning coupling supports the neural <italic>transformation</italic> of memories that renders them more integrated with other, similar memories, as predicted by TTT.</p><p>Which cortical areas, and which regions of the hippocampus, might coordinate their processing to support behavioral integration? Beginning with cortex, the earliest demonstration of post-learning connectivity implicate the involvement of category-selective cortex (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib118">Tambini et al., 2010</xref>). Numerous findings since then have shown that post-learning cortical connectivity with the hippocampus is governed by the category of the encoded memoranda (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Collins and Dickerson, 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib63">Keller and Just, 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib85">Murty et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib102">Schlichting and Preston, 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib128">Vilberg and Davachi, 2013</xref>). Because our stimuli are common objects, we focused on lateral occipital cortex (LOC), a region causally linked to the formation of object memories (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib120">Tambini and D’Esposito, 2020</xref>). Surprisingly, while there is ample evidence that hippocampal interactions with mPFC support integrative encoding (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib138">Zeithamova et al., 2012</xref>) and retrieval of remote memories (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib115">Takashima et al., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib78">McCormick et al., 2015</xref>), there is less evidence that hippocampal coupling with mPFC in post-learning periods leads to strengthening or integration of new memories (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib118">Tambini et al., 2010</xref>; although cf. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Bein et al., 2014</xref>). More commonly, post-learning hippocampal coupling with mPFC is related to updating and integrating of memories that were either previously strongly learned, older, or consistent with prior knowledge (e.g. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib127">van Kesteren et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib104">Schlichting and Preston, 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib74">Liu et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Cowan et al., 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Audrain and McAndrews, 2022</xref>). Because we were interested in examining neural processes related to the integration of newly learned information, we chose to focus on hippocampal interactions with LOC over mPFC.</p><p>Turning to the hippocampus, while the bulk of post-learning connectivity investigations treat the hippocampus as a unitary structure, there is some work that investigates differential connectivity with cortical regions along its long axis. Here, there are observations that post-learning connectivity between posterior hippocampus and category-selective cortical regions relate to memory for objects and scenes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib85">Murty et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib118">Tambini et al., 2010</xref>), whereas connectivity between anterior hippocampus and fusiform face area (FFA) has been shown to relate to memory for faces (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib75">Liu et al., 2018</xref>) and to explicit associative inferences across stimuli including faces (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib104">Schlichting and Preston, 2016</xref>). Connectivity with anterior or posterior hippocampus also depends on whether memory is rewarded, with memory performance for low-reward items correlated with connectivity between posterior hippocampus and category-selective cortex and memory for high-reward items related to connectivity between anterior hippocampus and category-selective cortex (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib85">Murty et al., 2017</xref>). Taken together, the factors that may explain differential connectivity patterns along the long axis of the hippocampus remain difficult to tease apart: possibilities include the form of behavior tested (memory for discrete events versus integration across them), the cortical regions selective to the content of encoded material, or the intrinsic or extrinsic motivation for consolidation. The present study employed object stimuli and did not implement a reward manipulation, so we chose to focus on posterior hippocampus, mirroring past experiments (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib85">Murty et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib118">Tambini et al., 2010</xref>). However, it is important to note that we based this focus solely on offline connectivity findings. When considering how the long axis of the hippocampus differentially supports memory integration, the anterior hippocampus is most often implicated, albeit during more immediate or online integration of stimuli (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib97">Schapiro et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib103">Schlichting et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib96">Ritchey et al., 2015</xref>). Given these differences in function along the long axis, our choice of focusing on posterior hippocampus was exploratory.</p></sec><sec id="s1-3"><title>Integration of sequential regularities</title><p>Rather than employing a more traditional explicit inference task, we generated sequences ending in overlapping and distinct objects (i.e. paradigmatic relations; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib76">Luo and Zhao, 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib79">McNeill, 1963</xref>). We made this decision for several reasons: (1) the learning of statistical regularities relies on the hippocampus and benefits from consolidation processes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib41">Durrant et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib42">Durrant et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib125">Turk-Browne et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib97">Schapiro et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib99">Schapiro et al., 2014</xref>), in line with predictions from TTT; (2) a statistical learning protocol enabled us to develop a behavioral task that relied on response times (RTs). In addition to statistical learning, RTs have been shown to reflect consolidation-dependent memory integration across several domains, including lexical integration of novel word learning (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Bowers et al., 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">Davis et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Coutanche and Thompson-Schill, 2014</xref>), motor learning (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib71">Kuriyama et al., 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib47">Fischer et al., 2006</xref>), and category learning (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib57">Hennies et al., 2014</xref>), making them an ideal readout of memory integration that minimizes potential on-the-fly retrieval strategies that might inflate rates of integration (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Abolghasem et al., 2023</xref>). RT measures were queried as a function of cortical similarity and hippocampal–cortical connectivity.</p><p>In two experiments, participants viewed sequences of three objects in an incidental encoding task. Each sequence was constructed such that the first two objects always appeared consecutively (A and B), and the third object alternated between two objects (C<sub>1</sub> and C<sub>2</sub>; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1C</xref>). We reasoned that after repeated exposures to these sequences, participants would come to anticipate the presentation of two different objects (C<sub>1</sub> and C<sub>2</sub>) upon encountering the beginning of each sequence (A and B). This expectation would give rise to a link between objects C<sub>1</sub> and C<sub>2</sub> strictly based on their shared antecedents. Thus, although C<sub>1</sub> and C<sub>2</sub> never co-occurred, we predicted that the two objects would become associated through their overlapping preceding A and B objects. We tested this prediction with a novel recognition priming task, which was developed to assess the implicit behavioral integration of overlapping sequences while minimizing intentional retrieval strategies at test. While we considered the priming task to be the main, planned index of behavioral integration, we also included an exploratory explicit memory test for comparison with the implicit test. Including both implicit and explicit memory tests also enabled us to explore changes in memory behaviors that may be underpinned by different memory processes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib56">Henke, 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Abolghasem et al., 2023</xref>).</p><fig-group><fig id="fig1" position="float"><label>Figure 1.</label><caption><title>Experimental Design.</title><p>(<bold>A</bold>) Experiment 1 design.

We investigated how the observed pattern of behavioral integration related to pattern similarity in mPFC as well as changes in rest connectivity between posterior hippocampus and LOC. We predicted that neural patterns in mPFC would become more correlated for objects from overlapping sequences, but only after a period of consolidation. We further predicted that correlations between the hippocampus and LOC in rest connectivity would increase after learning, and that both measures would relate to the extent of behavioral priming participants exhibited after a delay.

We used participants’ RTs to assess learning of the statistical structure embedded in the learning task and to confirm that sequence learning did not differ across the recent and remote learning sessions. Because B predictably followed A and either C<sub>1</sub> or C<sub>2</sub> predictably followed B, we reasoned that responses to B and C objects would be facilitated after repeated exposures to their sequential structure, resulting in decreased RTs relative to A and baseline objects, which were unpredictable. As an index of learning, we computed the RTs of participant’s size judgments as a function of whether the response of each object could be predicted by the presentation of the prior one.</p><sec id="s2-1-1"><title>Experiment 1</title><p>We computed the median RT of all A and baseline objects (unpredictable) and the median RT of all B and C objects (predictable), for each participant’s 16 runs during each learning session.

These values were entered into a mixed-effects linear model with repetition (continuous: 1–16), learning session (discrete: recent, remote), predictability (discrete: predicted, unpredicted), and their interactions as independent variables. This model revealed an effect of repetition (<italic>F</italic><sub>(1, 4448)</sub> = 1070.17, p &lt; 0.001), reflecting faster responses times as learning progressed, and an effect of predictability (<italic>F</italic><sub>(1, 232.4)</sub> = 4.48, p = 0.04) such that participants responded more quickly to predictable objects over unpredictable ones. These two effects were qualified by an interaction (<italic>F</italic><sub>(1, 4448)</sub> = 104.73, p &lt; 0.001), reflecting a steeper drop in RTs over learning for predictable objects relative to unpredictable ones (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1A</xref>).

These effects were driven by overall slower RTs and a steeper change in RTs across learning in the remote session relative to the recent one, suggesting that responses in the recent session were in part driven by acclimation to the task. Critically, there was no interaction between learning session and predictability or between learning session, predictability, and repetition (both <italic>F</italic>’s &lt; 2.10, both p’s &gt; 0.14) suggesting that participants became sensitive to the sequence structure and were faster to respond to predictable objects over unpredictable ones during both sessions.</p><p>Average accuracy on the size judgment task was high (92.6%; SD = 12.5%).

To test this prediction, we developed a novel recognition priming task in which participants viewed all objects from both learning sessions intermixed with novel foils and endorsed each as ‘old’ or ‘new’. Unbeknownst to the participants, the order of the objects was manipulated to use response priming as a behavioral index of participant’s implicit integration of C objects from overlapping sequences (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2A</xref>, top). Specifically, participants viewed a baseline object, then a C<sub>1</sub> object, then the C<sub>2</sub> object from its overlapping sequence. Notably, during learning, these three objects were presented the same number of times and never appeared in sequence. We developed mixed-effects models to examine differences in RTs between C<sub>2</sub> objects, which were preceded by and thus primed by C<sub>1</sub>, and RTs for C<sub>1</sub> objects, which were preceded by baseline objects and thus served as a control comparison (see Methods). To be included in this priming analysis, each pair of C objects and the preceding baseline object must have been correctly endorsed as ‘old’, meaning their responses during recognition were matched and thus could not be slowed by pressing a different button. Furthermore, each object only appeared once during recognition, as repeated presentations of objects may facilitate RTs and mask potential priming effects. Note that C<sub>1</sub> and C<sub>2</sub> are not differentiable to participants, as during learning, they both follow B an equal number of times and are presented within their sequence in a randomized and intermixed order.

This decision reflected our a priori prediction that remotely learned sequences would be more strongly integrated over recently learned ones. Indeed, we found faster RTs for primed objects relative to unprimed objects for the remotely learned objects (<italic>F</italic><sub>(1, 674.43)</sub> = 7.97, p = 0.005) but not the recently learned objects (<italic>F</italic><sub>(1, 69.12)</sub> = 0.37, p = 0.54).

The advantage of this approach is that every sequence was tested without repeating any images, as repetition could facilitate responses and mask potential priming effects. However, if participants improved at this task with practice, faster responses over the course of the task could explain the above priming effects—although notably, no priming was observed for recently learned sequences, despite being susceptible to the same practice effect.

Presenting images before and after learning enables us to extract ‘snapshots’ of the pattern of activity evoked by each image before and after participants learned their temporal associations. Specifically, we were interested in quantifying changes in the similarity in patterns of activity evoked by C objects as a function of whether they were learned in overlapping or distinct sequences (e.g. followed by the same or different AB images) and when they were learned (either in the recent or remote learning sessions). We also examined their relationship with the recognition priming effects observed in those participants. The pseudo-random trial order allowed us to statistically separate responses to individual images (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib97">Schapiro et al., 2012</xref>), and C<sub>1</sub> and C<sub>2</sub> objects were presented in separate exposure scans to ensure that their similarity was not driven by temporal proximity (see Methods for more details).</p><fig-group><fig id="fig3" position="float"><label>Figure 3.</label><caption><title>Learning- and consolidation-dependent changes in mPFC neural integration.</title><p>(<bold>A</bold>) Analysis approach for exposure scans.

We correlated these four matrices with a model matrix postulating greater similarity between C objects that followed the same AB sequence relative to those that followed different AB objects (‘neural integration model’; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3A</xref>). We then compared the pre-learning fit from the post-learning fit for recently and remotely learned objects, where a significant increase in fit would indicate that C objects following the same AB sequence became more similar to each other relative to C objects from other sequences. In contrast, a decrease in fit would indicate that C objects became more differentiated. As a reminder, the pre-learning exposure phase took place immediately before remote learning on Day 1, and the post-learning exposure phase took place after recent learning on Day 2. This design allows us to dissociate changes in similarity that emerge from sequence learning alone (recent learning), versus from learning followed by a period of consolidation (remote learning).</p><p>In this planned analysis, we predicted greater similarity between C objects in mPFC but only for remotely learned sequences. To this end, we applied this analysis to multi-voxel patterns in a functionally defined mPFC region from the learning scans (see Methods). This region and others exhibited greater BOLD signal for predictable objects (e.g. B and C objects) relative to unpredictable objects (i.e. A and baseline objects), when considering all learning scans in both sessions (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s2">Figure 1—figure supplement 2A</xref>). We chose this contrast to functionally define regions of interest (ROIs) because we reasoned that cortical regions that were sensitive to the temporal regularities generated by the sequences may be further involved in their offline consolidation and long-term storage (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Danker and Anderson, 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Davachi and Danker, 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib77">McClelland et al., 1995</xref>). Surprisingly, in mPFC, the change in fit between the correlation matrix reflecting neural similarity and the model was significantly negative for the remotely learned objects (<italic>t</italic><sub>(23)</sub> = −3.06, p = 0.006; Bonferroni-corrected p = 0.024; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3B</xref>). This decrease remained when accounting for variation in BOLD signal (see Methods for more details).

We confirmed this by computing the average similarity separately for C objects in overlapping and non-overlapping sequences, and separately for pre- and post-learning snapshots. We found a reliable decrease in similarity that was selective to objects from overlapping sequences, and no reliable change in similarity among objects in non-overlapping sequences (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s1">Figure 3—figure supplement 1</xref>). There was no reliable change in fit to the neural integration model for recently learned objects (<italic>t</italic><sub>(23)</sub> = −1.37, p = 0.18), however there was no reliable difference in the extent of the change in fit between recent and remote learning (<italic>t</italic><sub>(23)</sub> = −1.42, p = 0.17).</p></sec><sec id="s2-4-2"><title>Relationship between mPFC similarity and priming</title><p>Next, we asked whether changes in mPFC pattern similarity tracked the recognition priming observed for objects whose sequences were learned 24 hr prior. To do this, we quantified the priming effect for each participant as the median of the difference in RTs between responses to primed and unprimed C objects, where a greater difference score indicates a stronger priming effect. We then correlated this score with participants’ change in fit to the neural integration model from the pre- to post-learning exposure phases. We computed this correlation separately for the objects learned recently and remotely (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3C</xref>). We found that participants with <italic>increased similarity</italic> among C pairs from overlapping sequences exhibited a stronger priming effect, but only for pairs learned remotely (<italic>r</italic><sub>(22)</sub> = 0.57, p = 0.004, Bonferroni-corrected p = 0.016).

Furthermore, the correlation between change in mPFC similarity and priming was driven specifically by a change in similarity in the overlapping sequences learned in the remote session (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s2">Figure 3—figure supplement 2</xref>). This suggests that across participants, the extent of neural integration in mPFC reflects the extent of behavioral integration across overlapping sequences, but this association only emerges after a period involving consolidation.</p></sec><sec id="s2-4-3"><title>Control analyses</title><p>Here, we report steps taken to ensure that the observed changes in pattern similarity were not influenced by variability in BOLD signal across different patterns. First, our pattern similarity approach relied on point-biserial correlation, a special case of Pearson correlation that is invariant to average levels of BOLD signal across patterns. Thus, <italic>z</italic>-scoring across all voxels within a pattern would give rise to the exact correlation matrices as reported in the un-transformed main findings. Second, we <italic>z</italic>-scored BOLD signal of each voxel across all patterns, which aims to mitigate the influence of inordinately noisy voxels by down-weighting their extreme values across all trials (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib69">Kuhl and Chun, 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib94">Richter et al., 2016</xref>). This did not meaningfully change the reported results. This suggests that our findings are not influenced by variation in average BOLD signal.</p><p>We also developed an analysis to account for cases where C<sub>1</sub> and C<sub>2</sub> objects exhibited differences in average BOLD signal, reasoning that equivalent levels of BOLD signal (both high or both low) may give rise to higher similarity between two objects. To do this, we calculated the absolute value of the difference in average BOLD signal between each C<sub>1</sub> and C<sub>2</sub> object. We then re-analyzed the change in fit between mPFC similarity and the neural integration model, and the extent that this change correlated with recognition priming, while accounting for this new measure using partial correlations (see Methods for details of this analysis). When accounting for the difference in BOLD signal, we found that the correlation between neural similarity and the integration model was significantly negative for the remotely learned objects (<italic>t</italic><sub>(23)</sub> = −3.08, p = 0.005) and not for recently learned objects (<italic>t</italic><sub>(23)</sub> = −1.37, p = 0.18), with no reliable difference between the two (<italic>t</italic><sub>(23)</sub> = −1.51, p = 0.17). Furthermore, participants with increased similarity among C pairs exhibited a stronger priming effect, but only for pairs learned remotely (<italic>r</italic><sub>(22)</sub> = 0.58, p = 0.003) and not recently (<italic>r</italic><sub>(22)</sub> = −0.31, p = 0.15). In summary, we replicated the observed findings: (1) mPFC similarity decreased after learning, particularly after remote learning, and (2) participants with a greater change in similarity in mPFC after learning exhibited stronger recognition priming, only for the remotely learned objects. This suggests that the reported findings are not driven by average BOLD signal.</p></sec><sec id="s2-4-4"><title>Changes in similarity in other regions</title><p>In addition to our planned analysis of mPFC, we conducted exploratory analyses of learning- and consolidation-related changes in similarity in other regions.

Using the same neural integration model as with mPFC, we analyzed patterns of activity in LOC, a region sensitive to object stimuli. We found that C objects belonging to overlapping sequences grew more similar to each other after recent learning (<italic>t</italic><sub>(23)</sub> = 3.10, p = 0.005, Bonferroni-corrected p = 0.02) but not for the remotely learned objects (<italic>t</italic><sub>(23)</sub> = 0.38, p = 0.71), with no reliable difference across the two (<italic>t</italic><sub>(23)</sub> = 1.98, p = 0.06, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s3">Figure 3—figure supplement 3A</xref>). Interestingly, the average similarity between objects from all sequences increased in LOC, but the improved model fit for recently learned sequences was driven by a larger increase in similarity for objects from overlapping sequences relative to non-overlapping ones (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s3">Figure 3—figure supplement 3C</xref>). Unlike in mPFC, the extent of this change did not relate to behavioral priming across participants (both <italic>r</italic>’s &lt; 0.3, both p’s &gt; 0.14; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s3">Figure 3—figure supplement 3B</xref>).

For this analysis, we had one planned prediction, which was that AB pairs from the same sequences in the recent session would be more neurally integrated in the anterior hippocampus, as this would be a conceptual replication of prior work showing neural integration of temporally co-occurring shapes immediately after learning (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib97">Schapiro et al., 2012</xref>).

Notably, Day 1 of the experiment (comprising pre-learning rest, remote learning, and post-remote learning rest) is most analogous to prior designs investigating learning-related changes in connectivity, in that all scans take place on the same day, in the same scan session, with no learning or experimental sessions. The observation that hippocampal–LOC connectivity increases reliably after remote learning is a conceptual replication of those findings (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib85">Murty et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib118">Tambini et al., 2010</xref>).

Surprisingly, there was an increase in rest connectivity between LOC and mPFC (<italic>t</italic><sub>(22)</sub> = 2.25, p = 0.03). This increase was driven primarily by an increase after recent learning, on Day 2, although this did not survive comparison for multiple corrections (<italic>t</italic><sub>(22)</sub> = 2.31, p = 0.03, Bonferroni-corrected p = 0.15).

There was no reliable change in rest connectivity between mPFC and either anterior or posterior hippocampus (both <italic>t</italic>’s &lt; 1.23, both p’s &gt; 0.23), suggesting a selective role of sensory cortex in post-learning processing of the sequences consistent with prior work (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib85">Murty et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib118">Tambini et al., 2010</xref>).</p></sec><sec id="s2-5-2"><title>Relationship between rest connectivity and priming</title><p>As past work has observed that learning-related changes in rest connectivity are related to later memory for the preceding learned items (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib85">Murty et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib118">Tambini et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib121">Tompary et al., 2015</xref>), we next investigated whether changes in rest connectivity between posterior hippocampus and LOC related to our measures of integration as evidenced by recognition priming (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4C</xref>). To do this, we conducted two across-participant correlations between the change in rest connectivity (post- minus pre-learning) and median recognition priming of sequences: one from the remote learning session, and another from the recent learning session. We found that participants with a greater change in posterior hippocampal–LOC connectivity exhibited larger priming effects only for sequences from the remote learning session (<italic>r</italic><sub>(21)</sub> = 0.56, p = 0.005, Bonferroni-corrected p = 0.025) and not the recent learning session (<italic>r</italic><sub>(21)</sub> = 0.09, p = 0.69). This relationship between connectivity and behavior was not significantly different across the two sessions (<italic>z</italic> = 1.68, p = 0.09), suggesting caution in interpreting the relationship between connectivity and priming as solely emerging after a delay.</p><p>We conducted several control analyses to investigate the specificity of the relationship between changes in rest connectivity and recognition priming from the remote session. First, rest connectivity from the recent session did not relate to remote priming, and rest connectivity from the remote session did not relate to recent priming (both <italic>r</italic>’s &lt; 0.10, both p’s &gt; 0.65), suggesting that learning-related changes in rest were related solely to the memoranda learned in the intervening session. Second, LOC rest connectivity with neither mPFC (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s2">Figure 4—figure supplement 2B</xref>) nor anterior hippocampus related to priming from either session (all <italic>r</italic>’s &lt; 0.23, all p’s &gt; 0.28). Third, rest connectivity between LOC and posterior hippocampus did not relate to any explicit memory measures for C<sub>1</sub> and C<sub>2</sub> pairs at either time point (both <italic>r</italic>’s &lt; −0.32, both p’s &gt; 0.13). Together, these observations demonstrate that the long-term implicit integration across overlapping sequences is selectively related to immediate post-learning rest connectivity between the posterior hippocampus and LOC.</p></sec><sec id="s2-5-3"><title>Accounting for same- versus across-session change scores</title><p>A critical difference between the recent and remote conditions is that the pre-learning rest scan took place on Day 1 before the remote learning session, meaning that the change score from pre- to post-learning was computed across 24 hr for the recent condition but within the same scan session for the remote condition. We were concerned that this difference may insert noise into the change score for the recent condition. We reasoned that if this were the case, changes in coupling from pre-learning to post-recent learning rest may be more variable than changes in coupling from pre-learning to post-remote learning rest. We conducted <italic>F</italic>-tests to compare the variance of the change in these two hippocampal–LOC correlations and found no reliable difference (ratio of difference: <italic>F</italic><sub>(22, 22)</sub> = 0.811, p = 0.63), suggesting that the change score for the recent condition was not substantially noisier than that of the remote condition.</p><p>As an additional precaution, we side-stepped this potential confound of a difference in the change scores by computing the correlation between hippocampal–LOC coupling and priming separately for the pre- and post-learning scans (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s1">Figure 4—figure supplement 1</xref>). We found that neither pre- nor post-learning coupling related to priming of recently learned sequences (pre-learning: <italic>r</italic><sub>(21)</sub> = −0.19, p = 0.38, post-learning: <italic>r</italic><sub>(21)</sub> = −0.07, p = 0.75). Notably, the finding that the relationship between change in connectivity and priming of remotely learned sequences was driven by trends for a negative relationship pre-learning (<italic>r</italic><sub>(21)</sub> = −0.40, p = 0.06) and a positive relationship post-learning (<italic>r</italic><sub>(21)</sub> = 0.39, p = 0.07).</p><p>These findings suggest two things. First, the lack of a relationship between connectivity and priming of recently learned sequences is not due to a noisier change score that was computed across sessions, as there was no relationship with priming when isolating the post-learning rest scan. In contrast, the relationship between coupling and priming of remotely learned sequences was observed in the post-learning scan alone, albeit as a statistical trend. Second, these findings highlight the importance of employing a change score, as we observed a trend for a negative relationship between coupling and priming before learning occurred. This may be spurious, or it could reflect individual differences in intrinsic brain function (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib49">Fox et al., 2007</xref>), but regardless needs to be accounted for to identify signals that are selective to learning and consolidation processes.</p></sec></sec><sec id="s2-6"><title>Experiment 2: relationship between neural integration and rest connectivity</title><p>So far, we have reported that priming of overlapping sequences is related both to changes in their neural similarity in mPFC and increases in rest connectivity between posterior hippocampus and LOC.

We manipulated overlap in sequences of triplets such that objects shared antecedents (i.e. both were predicted by the appearance of the same pair of objects) but never occurred together in time. First, we found that participants’ RTs reflected increased association of objects with shared temporal structure, but only 24 hr after learning the sequences. This delay-dependent behavioral measure of integration was replicated in a cohort that underwent fMRI. In this cohort, we found that cortical neural similarity was shaped by sequence learning in a delay-dependent manner: patterns of activity in LOC reflected the immediate association of objects from overlapping sequences, while mPFC differentiated objects from overlapping sequences learned 24 hr prior. At the same time, learning of the sequences increased post-learning connectivity between the posterior hippocampus and LOC. Critically, after a 24-hr delay, changes in mPFC similarity and changes in hippocampal–LOC rest connectivity were correlated across participants, and both measures explained unique variance in the extent of recognition priming across participants. We interpret these findings as evidence that both coordinated hippocampal–cortical coupling and cortical learning are markers of consolidation that contribute to the behavioral integration of overlapping memories over time. Below, we discuss each of these findings through the lens of systems consolidation theories and in the context of prior empirical work.</p><sec id="s3-1"><title>Integration of overlapping regularities</title><p>As a reminder, we observed implicit integration across overlapping sequences in a recognition priming protocol, only after a 24-hr period, suggesting that systems-level consolidation processes can enhance behavioral integration across memories with overlapping content. This finding adds to the literature showing consolidation-dependent memory integration in different tests of integration: in transitive inference (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib43">Ellenbogen et al., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib72">Lau et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib132">Werchan and Gómez, 2013</xref>), the extraction of statistical regularities (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib129">Wagner et al., 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib41">Durrant et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib41">Durrant et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib112">Sweegers et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Batterink and Paller, 2017</xref>) and category learning (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">Djonlagic et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib51">Graveline and Wamsley, 2017</xref>). The observed integration seems to emerge over time due to a slowing of the control items, rather than a facilitation of the primed items. It is important to interpret this in light of the recognition decisions that participants made as a cover task. Slowing of recognition responses over delay periods is a classic time-dependent effect (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib93">Reber et al., 1997</xref>), and the fact that the RTs in the primed condition do not show this slowing suggests that implicit integration served as a protection against the slowing that would otherwise occur. However, as we did not find statistically reliable interaction between priming condition and day in either experiment, the notion that such integration develops solely after a 24-hr delay should be evaluated with caution.</p><p>While we only observed behavioral priming 24 hr after learning, we observed weak but reliable explicit integration for the same items immediately after learning, which remained unchanged over the same 24-hr period, consistent with many observations showing immediate explicit integration across overlapping memories (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Acuna et al., 2002a</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Acuna et al., 2002b</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib43">Ellenbogen et al., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib52">Greene et al., 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib55">Heckers et al., 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib72">Lau et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib91">Preston et al., 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib132">Werchan and Gómez, 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib138">Zeithamova et al., 2012</xref>). Even though both results are consistent with prior work, what could explain the discrepancy in the timing of successful implicit and explicit integration—both of which replicated in a second cohort of participants? A handful of behavioral studies find that participants perform better at explicit integration tests after sleep, but these studies differ in many factors that could explain the discrepancy with our findings: (1) instructions to explicitly encode premise pairs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib43">Ellenbogen et al., 2007</xref>), (2) foreknowledge of the underlying structure of the stimulus associations prior to learning (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib113">Sweegers and Talamini, 2014</xref>), and (3) the use of non-temporal versus temporal structure of the regularities (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib73">Lerner and Gluck, 2019</xref>).</p><p>The paradigms that specifically investigate the integration of sequences merit special attention. There is some evidence of transitive inference across overlapping sequences (e.g. inferring AC from viewing AB and BC in a continuous stream of colored dots) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib76">Luo and Zhao, 2018</xref>). Explicit recognition of these associations was on par with performance in our explicit integration task. However, there was no delayed test or implicit integration measure, precluding any interpretations about the role of consolidation in this form of integration. The sequences in our protocol also resemble paradigmatic relations (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib79">McNeill, 1963</xref>), which are second-order associations that do not co-occur, but instead are substitutable with each other because of their shared context (e.g. wearing ‘flip-flops’ and wearing ‘boots’). Interestingly, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib137">Yim et al., 2019</xref> observe implicit learning of paradigmatic relations only when participants are instructed to attend to the stimuli (i.e. actively categorizing images rather than listening to an auditory stream while coloring) and have robustly learned the relevant premise pairs. This fits with our findings in several ways: first, our encoding task required constant comparisons between the present and previous objects, which may have heightened awareness of the temporal regularities, like in their active encoding protocol. Second, Yim et al. find strong evidence of explicit memory for first-order associations across all experiments, which mirrors our observations of strong explicit knowledge of AB pairs. However, one notable difference is that Yim et al. did not administer an implicit test for paradigmatic associations after a delay, which is the only condition where we observe integration. Why integration emerges immediately after learning in their experiment, but only after a period of consolidation in our experiment, remains an open question.</p><p>Finally, the discrepancy between our implicit and explicit tasks could be explained more broadly by differences in memory strength for the within- and across-event associations. Results from the explicit memory test indicate much better integration of objects in the same sequence (A and B) relative to integration across sequences (C<sub>1</sub> and C<sub>2</sub>). Importantly, A and B were viewed twice as many times as each C, as they preceded each appearance of C<sub>1</sub> and C<sub>2</sub>. It may be that these overlearned associations are more accessible and explicit integration tests are sensitive to this information. At the same time, consolidation may promote representational changes that (1) benefit associations that are not already strengthened through sufficient learning (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib101">Schapiro et al., 2018</xref>), or (2) benefit implicit memories, which are more easily captured with measures like priming, more than explicit, declarative memories (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib56">Henke, 2010</xref>). These possibilities also fit well with TTT, which posits that differences in how a memory is expressed may be explained both by the relative strength of different neural traces at different time points, and by which of multiple neural traces is most suitable for the demands of the current task. It may be that neural representations supporting implicit integration may require time and consolidation to develop, while neural representations that can leverage explicit retrieval strategies may be available immediately after learning. The use of multiple behavioral tasks that capture both explicit and implicit expressions of memories is a fruitful approach that could be used to better characterize how different memory traces may be differentially expressed over time.</p><p>While we consider our priming task to be an implicit test of integration across sequences, the task does rely on explicit memory demands, as responses in the priming task reflect explicit recognition of each object in isolation. The use of a recognition task raises the question of whether our results would generalize to a task that does not rely on memory retrieval. Recently, there have been observations of implicit integration using a similar priming task in which participants made preference ratings for the learned stimuli (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Abolghasem et al., 2023</xref>). Given this, we speculate that response priming can reveal newly learned associations between stimuli regardless of the cover task. On the other hand, responses in the learning task required an explicit comparison of two objects in sequence, as participants decided if the object on screen was bigger or smaller than the preceding one. This emphasis on the temporal relationships between objects may have quickened participants’ ability to learn the sequences and in turn facilitated integration across overlapping sequences. Without this attention to temporal relationships, we speculate that learning of the sequences still may have occurred, but more exposure to the sequences would be required to reach the same magnitude of learning.</p><p>What learning mechanism could enable the integration of overlapping temporal regularities? One candidate is forward prediction: when encountering repeated sequences of events, neural representations of the predicted items are formed and strengthened over subsequent repetitions of the sequence (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib64">Kok et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib97">Schapiro et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib126">Turk-Browne et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib98">Schapiro et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib58">Hindy et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib100">Schapiro et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib65">Kok and Turk-Browne, 2018</xref>; for a review of hippocampal involvement, see <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">Davachi and DuBrow, 2015</xref>). In our case, due to the intermixed exposure to the same AB and two different C objects, forward prediction of both C objects while viewing B may have helped to cement their association. More specifically, the early comparisons between the two outcomes of an overlapping sequence may have produced a prediction error that directed attention to the differences across the two sequences, which would give rise to their successful retention and integration (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib130">Wahlheim and Zacks, 2019</xref>). Notably, the frequent interleaved repetition of the two overlapping sequences may have additionally strengthened their association; without this interleaved training, overlapping sequences may have been behaviorally differentiated in order to reduce interference across them (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Chanales et al., 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">Drascher and Kuhl, 2022</xref>). Forward prediction may not be the only mechanism that can give rise to the integration, as there is neural evidence that second-order associations built with predictable first-order associations are reflected in patterns of brain activity, suggesting that they can be learned in the absence of predictive mechanisms (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib98">Schapiro et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib100">Schapiro et al., 2016</xref>). Furthermore, the fact that we only observed behavioral integration after a delay suggests that forward prediction may not be sufficient to give rise to behavioral integration across events.</p></sec><sec id="s3-2"><title>Cortical and hippocampal similarity</title><p>We found that after 24 hr, patterns of activation in mPFC reflected differentiation of objects from overlapping sequences. This was counter to our prediction that with consolidation, neural patterns in mPFC would reflect similarities across sequences with shared temporal regularities, as most evidence of neural differentiation of highly similar or overlapping stimuli is observed in the hippocampus rather than in cortical regions (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib60">Hulbert and Norman, 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib45">Favila et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Chanales et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">Dimsdale-Zucker et al., 2018</xref>). There are a few noteworthy findings of mPFC differentiation that may help to make sense of this finding. First, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib44">Ezzyat et al., 2018</xref> observed that neural patterns evoked by associative memories in mPFC were more distinct than those evoked by item memories, but this difference only held for events that were re-studied after a night of sleep and not for events re-studied in the same experimental session. Second, individual autobiographical memories can be successfully decoded in mPFC, and classification accuracy for individual memories is greater for more remote memories relative to recent ones (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Bonnici et al., 2012</xref>). Third, differentiation in mPFC has been shown to emerge over repeated testing, in addition to over a delay period, and also relates to long-term memory (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib62">Karlsson Wirebring et al., 2015</xref>), in line with the idea that repeated testing can accelerate the stabilization of memories by minimizing competition with related memories (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Antony et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib60">Hulbert and Norman, 2015</xref>). Fourth, different regions of mPFC exhibit integration and differentiation signatures within the same experimental setting (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib103">Schlichting et al., 2015</xref>), suggesting that there may be anatomical distinctions across this region that were not considered in the present experiment. Nevertheless, we suggest that mPFC plays a role in the differentiation of discrete memories to support their long-term storage.</p><p>Perhaps the most surprising results we found were that despite this <italic>differentiation</italic> in mPFC when considering group-level changes, mPFC neural patterns reflecting <italic>integration</italic> positively scaled with priming across participants. This suggests that the level of neural representational overlap in the same subregions of mPFC may support both differentiation and integration of overlapping memories—extending beyond findings that different subregions within mPFC separately support differentiation and integration (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib103">Schlichting et al., 2015</xref>). Reports of correlations between neural and behavioral integration despite neural differentiation at the group level have been reported before (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib81">Molitor et al., 2021</xref>). This suggests that the restructuring of memories in mPFC conforms to ongoing goal states in addition to the properties of the experience itself (e.g. whether there are similarities or differences across events). Consistent with this, in past work, we found that neural pattern overlap increased in mPFC for objects paired with the same scene after a week, but these effects were observed in a source memory test focusing on the scenes, which either overlapped or were distinct from other memories, and less so in a standard recognition test of the experiment-unique objects (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib122">Tompary and Davachi, 2017</xref>). Furthermore, in a similar experiment where participants were required to make more fine-grained source memory judgements, mPFC patterns only reflected increasing neural integration over time when the encoded object–scene pairs were congruent with prior knowledge (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Audrain and McAndrews, 2022</xref>). These mixed results suggest that task demands matter: they likely prioritize processes that are most needed for successful performance (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Brunec et al., 2020</xref>), which could give rise to differentiated or integrated neural patterns evoked by the same stimuli depending on the task. Taken together, however, the extant data combined with past results supports the conclusion that dynamic neural representational change occurs in the mPFC that structures our experiences, but that it may be best to think of these representations as lying on a continuum from separated to integrated, and thus able to support behavior across a variety of tasks.</p><p>In this study, the pattern of activity in the anterior hippocampus reflected learned associations between objects that always appeared back-to-back (A and B). This is a direct replication of prior work (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib97">Schapiro et al., 2012</xref>) and also highlights the importance of hippocampal representations in memory for temporal order (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">DuBrow and Davachi, 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib59">Hsieh et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib61">Kalm et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib89">Paz et al., 2010</xref>). At the same time, there are several reports of hippocampal integration across events that are separated in time, both immediately after learning (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib96">Ritchey et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib100">Schapiro et al., 2016</xref>, p. 201; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib103">Schlichting et al., 2015</xref>) and after a delay (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Dandolo and Schwabe, 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib96">Ritchey et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib122">Tompary and Davachi, 2017</xref>), and even lesion work demonstrating the necessity of the hippocampus for such integration behaviors (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib88">Pajkert et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib99">Schapiro et al., 2014</xref>). Why then did we not observe changes in neural similarity in the hippocampus that reflected overlap across sequences separated in time? One possibility is that any signal reflecting overlap in the hippocampus may have been too subtle to identify in the exposure phase, as participants were not engaging with the objects in a manner that would promote integration processes. In contrast, signals reflecting AB integration may have been strong enough to appear in the absence of an active integration task because AB sequences were viewed twice as many times and were strongly explicitly remembered. Furthermore, as with any null effect, it could be due to low statistical power or low signal-to-noise ratio, a common issue for MRI investigations of medial temporal lobe structures.</p></sec><sec id="s3-3"><title>Post-encoding rest connectivity</title><p>A critical component of systems-level consolidation theories is that long-term memories become stabilized through communication between the hippocampus and cortex, resulting in cortical memory traces. Here, we found that learning object sequences resulted in increased rest connectivity between the posterior hippocampus and LOC, a region that codes for object information. This increase in connectivity was related to the extent of recognition priming across participants, suggesting that coordinated post-learning processing in these regions can facilitate the behavioral integration of overlapping memories. This finding extends a growing body of work demonstrating that hippocampal connectivity with stimulus-selective cortex is related to long-term memory retention (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Collins and Dickerson, 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">de Voogd et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib63">Keller and Just, 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib85">Murty et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib86">Murty et al., 2019</xref>). However, our findings differ from these observations in one critical way: we found that post-learning rest connectivity related to behavioral integration across overlapping memories, rather than retention of discrete memories. To our knowledge, the only one analogous finding has been observed, in a paradigm where post-learning rest connectivity between anterior hippocampus and the fusiform face area was measured after learning premise pairs in an associative inference paradigm (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib104">Schlichting and Preston, 2016</xref>). Together this suggests that post-learning rest connectivity may not only support the retention of specific episodic memories, but also underpin integration across them. When might consolidation processes support one over the other? One possibility could be that salient features surrounding learning shape consolidation to prioritize goal-relevant information (i.e. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Cowan et al., 2021</xref>). However, in our study and the one conducted by Schlichting and Preston, the integration tests were a surprise. Without cues about the test, it remains unclear which feature of memory may be prioritized by consolidation mechanisms, or if both are. Future studies should relate learning-related rest connectivity with distinct behavioral measures that capture both retention of individual events and across-event integration.</p><p>We also identified a delay-dependent relationship between changes in rest connectivity and cortical integration of objects from overlapping sequences. Specifically, participants with elevated posterior hippocampal–LOC rest connectivity after the remote learning session also exhibited greater neural integration in mPFC for the remotely studied objects. Both measures explained variance in recognition priming across participants, suggesting that they uniquely support delay-dependent behavioral integration. The timing of these two measures may hint at the directionality of their association: the rest scan occurred immediately after learning on Day 1, and the post-learning similarity values were measured on Day 2. This order parallels predictions from systems-level consolidation theories that cortical neural traces are trained by the hippocampus via coordinated processing (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib77">McClelland et al., 1995</xref>). An intuitive prediction is that coordination between the hippocampus and a particular cortical region would shape similarity in that same region. Indeed, in one study, pattern similarity in mPFC for objects studied in the same temporal context was related to connectivity between the anterior hippocampus and mPFC (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Cowan et al., 2020</xref>). Relatedly, past work has found that connectivity between anterior hippocampus and mPFC was related to the similarity of overlapping memories in mPC (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Cowan et al., 2020</xref>) and anterior hippocampus (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib122">Tompary and Davachi, 2017</xref>). In other words, both studies identified the same circuit despite differences in the site of representational change and in their experimental designs. However, the current findings suggest that the connection between post-learning connectivity and similarity is more complex, since we found that changes in similarity in mPFC related to changes in posterior hippocampal connectivity with LOC and not anterior hippocampal connectivity with mPFC. This is especially surprising when considering past work that more often implicates anterior hippocampus in memory integration (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib97">Schapiro et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib103">Schlichting et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib96">Ritchey et al., 2015</xref>). One possibility for this discrepancy is that the anterior hippocampus may support online and/or explicit integration, while the role of posterior hippocampus is to strengthen memory for discrete items in offline periods that can later be integrated via the anterior hippocampus. However, this is difficult to reconcile with the above-mentioned demonstration that offline connectivity between anterior hippocampus and mPFC relates to neural integration (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib122">Tompary and Davachi, 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Cowan et al., 2020</xref>). Further investigation of relationships between cortical similarity and post-learning processing is needed to constrain theories of systems-level consolidation and understand the precise circuit interactions unfolding over time that give rise to consolidated memories.</p></sec><sec id="s3-4"><title>Future directions, caveats, and conclusion</title><p>There are two major topics that we have so far neglected to mention but are integral to the study of the consolidation and integration of related events. First, new memories are not learned and consolidated in a vacuum. Prior knowledge has long been known to influence the formation of new event memories (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Alba and Hasher, 1983</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Anderson, 1984</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Bartlett, 1932</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Bransford and Johnson, 1972</xref>). More recently, much work has been devoted to understanding how prior knowledge influences neural processes that support their encoding, long-term storage, and transformation over time (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib74">Liu et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib75">Liu et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Bonasia et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Bellana et al., 2021</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Audrain and McAndrews, 2022</xref>). In our experiment, all object stimuli were real-world objects, thus the random assignments of object-triplet across participants may have incidentally introduce uneven pre-experimental associations among the sequences (e.g. belonging to the same category, or having similar functions, or sharing salient features). This raises interesting questions about how prior knowledge may influence the integration of new related memories in addition to their long-term stabilization, a promising avenue of future work.</p><p>Second, TTT is agnostic to whether consolidation mechanisms require the passage of time, or if there are circumstances in which integrated, cortically based memories can form quickly. There are now many demonstrations that memories can be rapidly consolidated, as characterized by longer retention durations and increased involvement of mPFC: through repeated retrieval (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Antony et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib46">Ferreira et al., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib136">Ye et al., 2020</xref>), through ‘fast-mapping’ of novel words onto new concepts (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Coutanche and Thompson-Schill, 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib108">Sharon et al., 2011</xref>); and for events that are consistent with prior knowledge, as discussed above. Furthermore, discrete events can be integrated into more general knowledge, like schemas, immediately after learning (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Brown and Evans, 1969</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib70">Kumaran et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib90">Posner and Keele, 1968</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib95">Richter et al., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib123">Tompary et al., 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib124">Tompary and Thompson-Schill, 2021</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib139">Zeng et al., 2021</xref>). However, this does not directly conflict with TTT, as new schemas are increasingly used after a delay even though they are immediately available (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib123">Tompary et al., 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib139">Zeng et al., 2021</xref>), consistent with TTT’s prediction that the form of memory that is expressed (detailed or schematic) is governed by the relative strength of the neural trace of that memory in the hippocampus versus cortex. Future work should test whether the consolidation-related neural measures presented in this study may similarly underpin the rapid integration of new information.</p><p>Finally, we note several important caveats. First, to manipulate the passage of time/course of consolidation within participants, we split encoding into two sessions and intermixed encoded memoranda into one test session. There are several advantages and disadvantages to this design over a design in which with one encoding session and retrieval split into ‘immediate’ and ‘delayed’ sessions. In our design, participants are only tested once, preventing rehearsal of stimuli to be tested after a delay after exposure to the test format in the ‘immediate’ session. An intermixed test also minimizes the chances that participants are switching retrieval strategies or response criteria for recent and remotely learned memoranda. However, encoding in the second ‘recent’ session may be influenced by the first ‘remote’ session. Indeed, knowledge of the task is reflected in the overall slower RTs but a larger facilitation in RTs across learning in the remote session relative to the recent one (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1</xref>). As we discussed, it is well known that prior knowledge can shape the encoding of new, similar events, often with a shift to circuits involving mPFC when encoding of events that are consistent with prior knowledge (e.g. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib127">van Kesteren et al., 2010</xref>). This may explain why we find increased rest connectivity of LOC and posterior hippocampus after the first, ‘remote’ session but increased rest connectivity of LOC and mPFC after the second, ‘recent’ session; both observations may be driven by processing of the remote memories, reflecting a shift from hippocampal to cortical processing across the two sessions. Indeed, the post-learning rest scan from the ‘recent’ scan may reflect processing of both recently and remotely learned stimuli, and this mixture of signals may have prevented us from identifying a clear link between rest connectivity and memory. In summary, neither a design with split encoding nor a design with split retrieval can perfectly isolate influences of consolidation. Ideally, in the future, consolidation effects will be observed in converging findings from both types of designs.</p><p>A second caveat is that we did not include a pre-learning rest scan during the ‘recent’ session. We chose not to include such a scan for several reasons. First, the Day 2 session was longer than that of Day 1 because it included the recognition priming and explicit memory tasks, and the addition of a pre-learning scan would have made the length of the session longer and more tiring for participants. Second, because we split learning into two sessions as discussed above, we anticipated that the pre-learning scan would not have been a ‘clean’ measure of baseline processing, but rather would include signal related to continued processing of the Day 1 ‘remote’ sequences, as multi-variate reactivation of learned stimuli has been observed in rest scans collected 24 hr after learning (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib102">Schlichting and Preston, 2014</xref>). For these reasons, we decided to use the pre-learning rest scan from the Day 1 ‘remote’ session as a baseline for both learning sessions. However, there is a concern that using a pre-learning scan from a different day might generated a noisier estimate of a change score between that scan and the post-recent learning scan, as patterns of resting-state connectivity are more correlated across two scans within the same experimental session relative to across two sessions (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib109">Shehzad et al., 2009</xref>). This added noise may have prevented us from observing a change in hippocampal–LOC coupling after recent learning, which would be equivalent to what we observed for remotely learned sequences and would reflect immediate offline processing of the recently learned sequences. However, as stated before, we instead observed a reliable increase in coupling between LOC and mPFC, which suggests that a change score computed across scan sessions is sensitive enough to identify changes in coupling at the group level. Furthermore, the fact that there was no relationship between a change in coupling and recognition priming of recent objects may be driven by the facts that there was no reliable evidence of priming of recently learned sequences in the recognition task.</p><p>A third caveat is that the post-learning exposure phase always followed recognition priming, which was the only task in which participants viewed C<sub>1</sub> and C<sub>2</sub> objects back-to-back. This new sequential order may have impacted their corresponding neural representations. When designing the study, we reasoned that it was more important for the behavioral priming task to come before the exposure scans, as all objects were shown only once in that task, whereas they were shown four to five times in a random order in the post-learning exposure phase. Because of this difference in presentation times, and because behavioral priming findings tend to be very sensitive, we reasoned that it was more important to protect the priming task from the exposure scan instead of the reverse. Furthermore, we expected that the single additional presentation of the C objects in the recognition priming task would not substantially override their sequence learning, as C objects were each presented 16 times in their sequence (ABC<sub>1</sub> and ABC<sub>2</sub> 16 times each). Critically, the order of C objects during recognition was the same for recent and remote conditions; since we observed a selective change in neural representation for the remote condition and no corresponding change for the recent condition, this suggests that recognition priming order alone could not substantially impact the representations.</p><p>A fourth caveat concerns the control condition in the priming task. The control condition comprised responses to C objects that followed baseline items rather than C objects from different sequences. We decided to use baseline items as we wished to maximize the number of comparisons in the primed condition for power purposes while only presenting each object once—as mentioned above, repetition of objects in this task may have further facilitated RTs and potentially masked any priming effects. However, this design choice leaves opens the possibility that <italic>all</italic> C objects became behaviorally integrated regardless of their sequence overlap, due to some other dimension of the learning task. For instance, all C objects are positioned ‘third’ in each sequence, and they have identical transition probabilities. We find encouraging evidence that such integration by position is unlikely. First, the observed priming effect for the remotely learned sequences is selectively correlated with post-learning neural similarity between C objects from overlapping sequences, and not related to similarity between C objects from different sequences (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s1">Figure 3—figure supplement 1</xref>). Furthermore, the explicit integration tests in both experiments used C objects from other sequences as foils, either appearing in re-arranged pairs in Experiment 1 or as the foil option in Experiment 2. Above-chance performance in both experiments suggests that participants successfully learned some sequence-specific associations, rather than merely learning positional information about the different objects. However, future work with a sequence-specific control condition would strengthen our claim that priming between the C objects specifically reflects the integration of objects from overlapping events.</p><p>Taken together, the present results demonstrate that over time, episodic memories that share temporal regularities become behaviorally integrated. Furthermore, these findings provide evidence for the notion that psychological transformations in memories are accompanied by shifts in cortical similarity—both integration and differentiation—and driven by post-learning hippocampal–cortical coupling. These observations reveal new insights into the development of conceptual or semantic memory over time, suggesting that the consolidation of memories with overlapping temporal structures may constitute a key driver of memory integration.</p></sec></sec><sec id="s4" sec-type="materials|methods"><title>Materials and methods</title><sec id="s4-1"><title>Experiment 1</title><sec id="s4-1-1"><title>Subjects</title><p>Ninety right-handed, native English speakers participated in this experiment.

Then, participants completed two tests consisting of both sets of stimuli from the two learning sessions: a recognition priming task and an explicit integration task.

sequence of ABC<sub>1</sub> and ABC<sub>2</sub> was repeated 16 times, meaning that A and B were exposed to participants 32 times and C<sub>1</sub> and C<sub>2</sub> were exposed to participants 16 times over the course of learning. Baseline objects were presented 16 times to equate exposure frequency with C objects. In other words, ABC<sub>1</sub> and ABC<sub>2</sub> sequences would be intermixed either with baseline objects or other sequences. The presentation of all sequences and baseline objects were divided into four 11-min learning blocks per session, and participants were given the option to take a 1-min break between blocks. The order of the stimuli was pseudo-randomized such that all sequences (ABC<sub>1</sub> and ABC<sub>2</sub>) appeared four times in each block, all baseline objects appeared twice in each block, and no sequence with the same A and B objects was presented back-to-back.</p><p>The presentation timing was designed in anticipation of the planned fMRI experiment (see Experiment 2). Each object was presented for 2 s, and participants were instructed to respond as quickly as possible before the object was removed from the screen, without sacrificing accuracy. Between each trial, there was a variable inter-trial interval (ITI) ranging from 0 to 4 s. The ITI was constructed to optimize item-level pattern similarity analyses between C<sub>1</sub> and C<sub>2</sub> within a sequence (not reported in this manuscript), while also allowing for sufficient jittering of trials to perform condition-level univariate analyses. The ITIs between sequences and before and after baseline objects were randomly jittered.</p><p>Finally, the sizes of objects in each sequence were pre-determined such that the motor response to C objects were matched within each sequence. To do this, we divided the object into ‘big’ and ‘small’ bins based on estimations of their size relative to a shoe box. We then arranged the objects into sequences such that both C<sub>1</sub> and C<sub>2</sub> were either bigger or smaller than B. Furthermore, in half of the sequences in each learning session, C<sub>1</sub> and C<sub>2</sub> were bigger than B, and in the other half, C<sub>1</sub> and C<sub>2</sub> were smaller than B. However, because the sequences and baseline object were randomly intermixed, motor responses to A, B, and baseline object were not matched in this same manner (e.g. a ‘big’ baseline object could precede a ‘big’ A object). Because of this, accuracy of size judgments could not be derived for these comparisons because the objects’ relative sizes might be judged differently according to participants’ preferences and past experiences. Thus, accuracy was reported only for the images with a clear answer (e.g. a ‘big’ object following a ‘small’ object or vice versa), and RTs were reported for all images regardless of accuracy for the objects with a clear answer.</p></sec><sec id="s4-1-5"><title>Recognition priming task</title><p>In this task, all 60 objects from both learning sessions were presented intermixed with 40 novel foils. As a cover task, participants were instructed to endorse each object as ‘old’ or ‘new’. They were asked to respond as quickly as possible without sacrificing accuracy, and they were not given an opt-out or ‘don’t know’ option. The ITI between each trial was fixed at 1 s.</p><p>Unbeknownst to the participants, the order of the objects was manipulated to use response priming as an index of participant’s implicit knowledge of the association between C<sub>1</sub> and C<sub>2</sub>. A priming manipulation was used to test memory for ‘across-episode’ associations: namely, the association between C objects that followed the same sequence of A and B. Critically, ABC<sub>1</sub> and ABC<sub>2</sub> were never experienced together, but through the overlap in A and B objects, we expect the two episodes to become associated. Note that to participants, C<sub>1</sub> and C<sub>2</sub> objects hold an identical mnemonic status, as they both follow B an equal number of times and are presented within their sequence in randomized order over learning. We have assigned them with separate labels for the sole purpose of clarifying the conditions of the priming manipulation. If participants successfully associated C<sub>1</sub> and C<sub>2</sub> through their shared prior sequential information, we expected that the presentation of C<sub>1</sub> before C<sub>2</sub> would facilitate processing of C<sub>2</sub>, resulting in a faster RT. Each C<sub>1</sub> object directly preceded the C<sub>2</sub> object that shared an overlapping sequence of A and B during learning. As a control comparison, each C<sub>1</sub> object followed a baseline object learned in the same session. Since C and baseline objects share no sequential information, we predicted that the baseline object would not facilitate of processing of C. This order (baseline, C<sub>1</sub>, and C<sub>2</sub>) also controlled for motor response history, as we only included objects that (1) were correctly endorsed as ‘old’ and (2) whose prior objects were also correctly endorsed as ‘old’. See <xref ref-type="table" rid="table1">Table 1B</xref> for transition probabilities between all objects during the recognition task.</p><p>Notably, the sequences that comprise both primed (C<sub>1</sub> -&gt; C<sub>2</sub>) and control (baseline -&gt; C<sub>1</sub>) conditions were never present during learning. This means that if participants were able to extract rules about different item types, both transitions are matched in that they would be considered expectation violations. For example, baseline objects are only followed by A or other baseline items during learning, but in this task, they are followed by C<sub>1</sub> objects. Similarly, C<sub>1</sub> and C<sub>2</sub> objects are only preceded by B objects during learning, but in this task, C<sub>2</sub> objects are preceded by C<sub>1</sub> objects. Because neither set of transitions appears during learning, any difference in RTs across the conditions can be attributed to differences in the sequence-specific associations between objects, rather than rule-based information about sequential positions.</p><p>We additionally arranged B objects to always follow the A object from the same learning sequence. Like with the C objects, responses times for A and B were only analyzed if both objects were correctly endorsed as ‘old’ and if the prior object was also correctly endorsed. Note however that these comparisons were secondary to our main planned analyses, and due to constraints in randomization, A objects could either be followed by a different old object or a novel foil; thus the motor history for these objects is not controlled for to the same extent as C objects.</p></sec><sec id="s4-1-6"><title>Explicit memory task</title><p>This task followed the recognition priming task. Due to experimental error, two participants did not complete this task, leaving a sample size of 71. In this task, participants were first made aware that the objects in the learning task were arranged into sequences: ‘You may have noticed that during the size task, some objects often appeared in sequences. For instance, maybe two objects always appeared back-to-back, Or, maybe two objects were always preceded by the same sequence.’ This was accompanied by a visualization of a pair of overlapping ABC<sub>1</sub> and ABC<sub>2</sub> sequences. Participants then viewed pairs of objects and were asked to rate their familiarity from ‘Not familiar’ to ‘Very familiar’ specifically based on any sequence information they had learned. They responded by clicking on an un-numbered sliding scale. Each pair was presented for 6 s, separated by a jittered ITI ranging from 0.5 to 1.5 s. Participants viewed 60 pairs: 12 intact AB pairs; 12 re-arranged A and B objects; 12 intact C pairs; 12 re-arranged C objects; and 12 pairs of randomly paired baseline objects. All objects from sequences were viewed twice, once with its corresponding pair and once as a foil in a re-arranged pair.</p></sec><sec id="s4-1-7"><title>Unreported tasks</title><p>Participants from Experiment 1 were originally divided into two separate behavioral cohorts that piloted the feasibility of other memory tests that were ultimately not included in Experiment 2. One cohort (<italic>N</italic> = 48) completed a free recall task, and a second cohort (<italic>N</italic> = 42) completed a sequence test that mirrored the learning procedure but intermixed sequences from both learning sessions. These tasks were conducted at the end of the second session. Since all aspects of the procedure were identical across the two cohorts until the presentation of those tasks, we have analyzed these two cohorts together to serve as Experiment 1.</p></sec><sec id="s4-1-8"><title>Statistical analyses</title><p>Linear mixed-effects models were used to quantify recognition priming and to characterize changes in RTs and accuracy across learning. Participant intercepts and slope terms for each included predictor variable were modeled as random effects. Random effects were kept maximal except where needed to avoid singular model fits (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Barr et al., 2013</xref>). The significance of a given contrast was obtained using Satterthwaite approximate degrees of freedom, resulting in <italic>F</italic> or <italic>t</italic> statistics and corresponding p values. RTs for all learning trials were included in these models, but RTs during recognition priming were only included if the current and prior objects were correctly endorsed as ‘old’ (see Recognition Priming Task for more details). Accuracy was computed for any learning trial in which the preceding object was coded to be a different size (e.g. an object bigger than a shoebox following an object smaller than a shoebox), as comparisons among objects that were both bigger or both smaller are likely more variable and dependent on participants’ subjective opinion.</p><p>Explicit memory performance was aggregated for each participant as the average difference in familiarity between Intact and Re-arranged pairs, such that a value of 0 would indicate no reliable discrimination and 1 would indicate maximal discrimination between the two conditions. These values were entered into two-tailed paired <italic>t</italic>-tests to test for differences in behavioral integration between the two learning sessions. One-sample <italic>t</italic>-tests with <italic>μ</italic> = 0 were used to test for reliable above-chance performance, which would reflect evidence for integration.</p></sec></sec><sec id="s4-2"><title>Experiment 2</title><sec id="s4-2-1"><title>Subjects</title><p>Twenty-eight right-handed, native English speakers (14 female, mean age: 27.14, range: 20–34) participated in this experiment. Participants were recruited from New York University and the broader community. The University Committee on Activities Involving Human Subjects approved all recruitment and consent protocols. Three participants were excluded due to scanner malfunction, and one withdrew after the first session, leaving 24 participants that were included in the following analyses.</p></sec><sec id="s4-2-2"><title>Procedure</title><p>The experiment consisted of two sessions, separated by approximately 24 hr. The encoding and priming tasks were identical to that of Experiment 1, except that encoding was split into eight scans rather than four blocks. Additionally, in the first session, participants also first completed a resting-state scan, and then viewed all object stimuli in a random order (pre-learning exposure). Then, participants incidentally encoded sequences of the objects while performing a cover task (remote learning). Finally, participants completed a second resting-state scan. The stimuli were projected onto a screen in the bore of the scanner, and participants viewed them through a mirror attached to the head coil.</p><p>In the second session, participants began by incidentally learning a new set of object sequences while performing the same cover task as in the first session (recent learning). After a resting-state scan, participants completed several tasks consisting of both sets of stimuli from the two learning sessions. First, they completed a priming task, and again viewed all stimuli in a random order (post-learning exposure). Finally, participants completed an explicit test of memory integration.</p><p>The recognition priming task was the only task in the experiment that was not scanned, even though participants completed the task in the scanner between the rest and post-learning similarity scans.</p></sec><sec id="s4-2-3"><title>Explicit memory task</title><p>At the end of the recent session, participants underwent two scans that tested explicit memory for associations between A and B objects and associations between C<sub>1</sub> and C<sub>2</sub> objects (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2B</xref>). The same instructions as Experiment 1 were used to make participants aware of the object sequences they had viewed. Then, in the first scan, participants were presented with an A object at the top of the screen and two B objects at the bottom of the screen. Participants were instructed to choose which B object was paired with the cued A object during learning. The foil B object was from a different sequence in the same learning session. These trials were intermixed with trials where B objects were cued and participants chose the corresponding A object. The same cue/foil structure was used to test explicit memory for the association between C<sub>1</sub> and C<sub>2</sub> objects in the second scan. Each trial was presented for 4 s with a variable ITI ranging from 3 to 8 s.</p></sec><sec id="s4-2-4"><title>Pre- and post-learning snapshots</title><p>Before the remote learning session on Day 1 and after the recent learning session and priming task on Day 2, participants viewed all objects in a pseudo-random order over the course of two 11.8-min scans. The goal of these scans was to create a template pattern for each object stimulus before and after participants learned their temporal associations. With these template patterns, we measured changes in representational similarity between objects that were associated through their temporal structure. Changes in pattern similarity from pre- to post-learning among <italic>recently</italic> learned objects would reflect changes in memory representations that corresponded to the temporal structure learned a few minutes beforehand. In contrast, changes in pattern similarity among <italic>remotely</italic> learned objects would reflect consolidation-related processes in addition to learning-related changes seen in the recent condition.</p><p>Each object was presented for 2 s, separated by a variable ITI ranging from 2 to 5 s. Participants were instructed to view each object and press a button if a small pound sign (#) appeared anywhere on the image. A pound sign appeared on 20 images (approximately 8% of all trials presented). The objects for which a pound sign appeared were presented a total of five times instead of four, and the trial with the pound sign was omitted from all similarity analyses.</p><p>All object stimuli were presented across two scans each in the pre- and post-learning exposure phases. The order during the pre-learning exposure was identical to the order during the post-learning exposure in order to equate any potential confounds due to order effects or biases in modeling the BOLD response. The order of the objects in each scan was randomized for each participant, with the constraint that no object would repeat back-to-back. All A objects, all C<sub>1</sub> objects, and half of the baseline objects were presented four times, intermixed in the first scan, and all B objects, all C<sub>2</sub> objects, and the other half of the baseline objects were presented four times, intermixed in the second scan. This arrangement enabled us to prioritize the analysis of similarity between A and B objects, and C<sub>1</sub> and C<sub>2</sub> objects, since the objects were presented in separate scans (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib84">Mumford et al., 2014</xref>).

During the scans, participants viewed a blank gray screen and were instructed to remain awake while thinking about whatever they wanted (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib53">Greicius et al., 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib118">Tambini et al., 2010</xref>).</p></sec><sec id="s4-2-6"><title>fMRI parameters</title><p>All scans were collected with a whole-head coil using a 3T Siemens Allegra MRI system. Functional scans consisted of multi-echo gradient-echo planar images (EPI: 2000 ms repetition time (TR), 15 ms echo time (TE), flip angle = 82°, field of view (FOV) = 192 × 240, 3 mm isotropic voxels), with 34 slices oriented parallel to the anterior commissure - posterior commissure (AC–PC) line. For both sessions, a customized calibration scan was collected using the same slice prescription as the EPI scans. At the end of the second scan, a T1-weighted high-resolution magnetization-prepared rapid-acquisition gradient echo (MPRAGE) sequence (1 × 1 × 1 mm voxels, 176 sagittal slices) was collected.</p></sec><sec id="s4-2-7"><title>Preprocessing</title><p>All learning, rest, and pre- and post-learning exposure scans underwent the same preprocessing steps with FSL (FEAT: <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://www.fmrib.ox.ac.uk/fsl">http://www.fmrib.ox.ac.uk/fsl</ext-link>). The first six volumes of each EPI were discarded to allow for scanner stabilization. Then, each scan was slice-time corrected and realigned to correct for motion within each run. Smoothing differed based on the analysis: the learning and rest scans were smoothed with a 6-mm full width at half maximum (FWHM) Gaussian kernel, while the pre- and post-learning scans were smoothed with a 3-mm FWHM Gaussian kernel. All scans were high-pass filtered at 0.01 Hz to remove low-frequency drifts in signal (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Cordes et al., 2001</xref>) and then aligned to the first pre-learning similarity scan from the remote session.</p></sec><sec id="s4-2-8"><title>Pre- and post-learning pattern similarity</title><p>The four pre- and post-learning scans were entered into separate general linear models (GLMs) after preprocessing. In each scan, a separate 3-s boxcar regressor was created for the four presentations of each object throughout the scan. One ‘junk’ regressor was created to model the onset of all trials for which participants made a key press. These trials could either be the target trials presented with the pound sign, or any other trial where the participant incorrectly pressed the button in response to a stimulus with no pound sign. As with the learning scans, regressors accounting for head motion were included as well.</p><p>These GLMs gave rise to two <italic>t</italic>-statistic maps for each object presented in the two learning sessions, one from before learning and one from after learning. For each map, the spatial pattern of activity across each ROI was extracted into a vector. These vectors were not <italic>z</italic>-scored; similarity analyses did not meaningfully change if voxels were <italic>z</italic>-scored across all patterns. Pearson correlations were computed to measure the neural similarity between vectors of all C objects presented. These were organized into two separate matrices representing C objects from the recent and remote learning sessions. The matrices were then transformed into vectors with the same order of matrix elements. These two vectors were then correlated with the neural ‘integration’ model, a matrix of ones and zeros that represented whether C objects were from overlapping or distinct sequences, that was similarly organized into vector form (e.g. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3A</xref>). A third vector was computed by subtracting the pre-learning vector from the post-learning vector to represent learning-related changes in neural similarity (e.g. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3B</xref>). A high Point-biserial correlation between neural data and this integration model would reflect greater similarity between images that followed the same AB pairs relative to images that followed different AB pairs. These correlations were Fisher transformed before being entered into statistical tests.</p><p>To control for the possibility that similarity between two objects was driven by differences in average BOLD signal between them, we generated two additional correlation matrices composed of C<sub>1</sub> and C<sub>2</sub> objects, arranged in the same order as the pattern similarity and integration matrices, separately for the pre- and post-learning exposure scans. For each cell, we computed the absolute value of the difference in BOLD signal across the two objects. This matrix thus represents cases where BOLD signal of two objects is close or far apart. Then, since the relationship between the neural integration model and similarity data for a given ROI and exposure phase was originally analyzed by transforming the two matrices into vectors and computing their correlation, we also transformed the BOLD signal matrix into a vector with the same order of elements and used it in partial correlation analyses that corresponded to the main analyses (e.g. re-computing the correlation between mPFC similarity and the neural integration model, while accounting for the difference in BOLD signal).</p></sec><sec id="s4-2-9"><title>Resting-state connectivity</title><p>The rest scans were used to quantify low-frequency correlations between pairs of ROIs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Albert et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib118">Tambini et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib121">Tompary et al., 2015</xref>), a measure of functional connectivity between regions. To this end, the preprocessed data from the three rest scans were band-pass filtered leaving signal between 0.01 and.1 Hz (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib48">Fox et al., 2005</xref>). They were then entered into separate GLMs to model nuisance signals, including: six motion regressors and their temporal derivatives; stick functions accounting for sudden head movements; and nuisance signals from white matter tissue and cerebral spinal fluid (CSF) and their temporal derivatives. The motion regressors were derived from frame displacement measurements identifying during motion correction. TRs with sudden head movements were identified with <italic>FSL_motion_outliers</italic>. To create nuisance regressors, each participant’s MPRAGE was segmented into separate masks comprising gray matter, white matter, and CSF, using <italic>FAST</italic>. The gray matter and CSF masks were aligned to each participant’s functional volumes and then eroded using <italic>fslmaths</italic>, to minimize the likelihood that these masks contained voxels that partially overlapped with gray matter. Then, the average time course across all voxels in each mask was extracted from the preprocessed rest scans. These time courses were entered into each run’s GLM along with their temporal derivatives.</p><p>The residuals of these GLMs were band-pass-filtered, leaving signal ranging from 0.01 and 0.1 Hz, which is the frequency range known to correspond to correlations between gray matter regions in functional neuroimaging data (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Cordes et al., 2001</xref>). Then, the average time course for every volume in each rest run was extracted for each ROI. These time courses were then correlated (Pearson correlation), Fisher transformed, and entered into statistical tests.</p></sec><sec id="s4-2-10"><title>Regions of interest</title><p>Bilateral hippocampus was defined using FSL’s automatic subcortical segmentation protocol (FIRST), which anatomically defines subcortical regions using each participant’s T1 anatomical image.

All ROIs were resampled and aligned to the first similarity scan during the remote session, consistent with the functional scans.</p><p>Medial PFC and LOC were functionally defined from the learning scans. Specifically, we sought regions that were sensitive to the transition probabilities of the presented triplets. To identify changes in BOLD signal to objects with different transition probabilities, we entered each learning scan into a separate GLM after preprocessing. Two regressors were generated: predictable (B, C<sub>1</sub>, and C<sub>2</sub>), and unpredictable (A, baseline). C<sub>1</sub> and C<sub>2</sub> objects were included in the same regressor because participants were unable to differentiate those objects during learning. Trials with no response, or with an RT &gt;3 SD from the participant’s mean RT, were separately modeled in a regressor of no interest. These regressors and their temporal derivatives were convolved with FSL’s canonical hemodynamic response function (HRF). To account for head motion, the six regressors derived from the motion correction procedure were included in each GLM along with their temporal derivatives and stick function regressors derived by <italic>FSL_motion_outliers</italic>.</p><p>This resulted in 16 models per participant (8 per session), which were then entered into a fixed-effects analysis in which the first-level estimates were averaged over the two sessions.

Pearson correlations were used to quantify relationships between neural and behavioral measures across participants.

Pattern similarity across C objects was corrected for four regions (mPFC, LOC, anterior hippocampus, posterior hippocampus). Pattern similarity across A and B objects was corrected for three regions (LOC, anterior hippocampus, posterior hippocampus). Learning-related changes in rest was corrected for five region pairs (posterior hippocampus—LOC, anterior hippocampus—LOC, mPFC—LOC, posterior hippocampus—mPFC, anterior hippocampus—mPFC).</p></sec></sec></sec></body><back><sec sec-type="additional-information" id="s5"><title>Additional information</title><fn-group content-type="competing-interest"><title>Competing interests</title><fn fn-type="COI-statement" id="conf1"><p>No competing interests declared</p></fn><fn fn-type="COI-statement" id="conf2"><p>Reviewing editor, <italic>eLife</italic></p></fn></fn-group><fn-group content-type="author-contribution"><title>Author contributions</title><fn fn-type="con" id="con1"><p>Conceptualization, Data curation, Software, Formal analysis, Validation, Investigation, Visualization, Methodology, Writing - original draft, Project administration, Writing - review and editing</p></fn><fn fn-type="con" id="con2"><p>Conceptualization, Supervision, Funding acquisition, Methodology, Project administration, Writing - review and editing</p></fn></fn-group><fn-group content-type="ethics-information"><title>Ethics</title><fn fn-type="other"><p>Consent to participate and consent to publish was obtained for all participants prior to beginning the first experimental session.

over time (24h period), using a novel behavioral task and fMRI. The work advances our understanding of the neural processes supporting the behavioral integration of memories for distinct events that are never experienced together in time but are linked by shared predictive cues.

Your article has been reviewed by 3 peer reviewers, one of whom is a member of our Board of Reviewing Editors, and the evaluation has been overseen by Michael Frank as the Senior Editor. The reviewers have opted to remain anonymous.</p><p>The reviewers have discussed their reviews with one another, and the Reviewing Editor has drafted this to help you prepare a revised submission.</p><p>Essential Revisions:</p><p>(1) Reviewers agreed that more data on the neural integration/differentiation effects are key to evaluating the findings (points originally raised by Reviewer 1, comment 2 [R1.2] and R3). Please report the pattern underlying the overall pre- to post-learning change in correspondence with the predicted model: how similar are related and unrelated C items to one another pre-learning? How similar are they post-learning? At both pre- and post-learning, is there a difference between related and unrelated C similarities? Is there a reliable pre- to post-learning change in one or both of these sets of comparisons? Once these analyses are fully reported, please revise the paper if needed such that the interpretation is consistent with these more specific patterns of change. Moreover, please consider which effects or changes seem to be driving the subsequent analyses that use these measures.</p><p>(2) Please consider in the paper how the lack of a same-day baseline for the recent condition would affect the connectivity changes. Reviewers wondered why there was no day 2 baseline, and whether this was for theoretical or practical reasons [Reviewer 1.1a-b]. In the consultation session, Reviewers expressed different intuitions about whether indexing pre- to post-learning change for the recent memories using a baseline from a prior day should lead to inflated, or noisier (R1.1c-d), estimates for that measure. However, there was agreement that this issue should be discussed as a limitation in the paper. In addition, Reviewers thought that perhaps control analyses with some set of regions that should be minimally involved in memory consolidation might help strengthen the current findings.</p><p>(3) Many of the effects were only observed in the remote condition or for remote items, but not for the recent (R3). However, there were no significant interactions such that the effects are reliably larger for remote than recent. Therefore, the interpretive contrast rests on a null effect in the recent condition, which of course could be due to many factors (including things like the lack of same-day baseline, as noted in the previous point and mentioned by R1; as well as perhaps insensitivity to behavioral priming for the recent memories due to speeding in the control condition as raised by R3). Accordingly, Reviewers all agreed that claims should be toned down to align with these statistics.</p><p>(4) There were a few points raised about the different sequences participants were exposed to across the entire study. (a) First, Reviewers wanted to see more information about this. For example, R2 (weakness #1) recommended a table of transition probabilities during sequence learning and the priming task, and consideration of whether those do or do not match. It might additionally be useful to include this information for the pre- and post-learning exposure phases. Could correspondence, or lack thereof, of the different transitions across tasks have influenced the results in any way? All Reviewers agreed that more information on that structure would be valuable. (b) Given the priming occurred prior to the post-learning exposure, it seemed as though the priming task could influence the post-learning representations. Specifically, in the Reviewers' understanding, unrelated C items always appeared in sequence during the priming task and therefore could have become &quot;integrated&quot; through that experience (R1.3). Please clarify this issue, perform control analyses, and/or consider this limitation in the Discussion.</p><p>(5) Reviewers had questions about the priming task. First, there were requests for more details about this task design in the main paper. Second, Reviewers noted that priming was mainly driven by slowing for the control items (with remote RTs being longer than recent RTs), rather than a difference for the critical C items (R3). Third and perhaps relatedly, Reviewers thought that control transitions always happened prior to the primed transitions (R1.4), and wondered if this might somehow be important (i.e., could it explain the control item slowing somehow, or more generally have influenced the findings?). For the latter two subpoints, Reviewers wanted greater consideration of these issues in a revision -- perhaps analytically if possible, and if not then noted in the paper as a limitation. Overall however, the Reviewers reasoned that the design in which recent and remote memories were tested together, as well as the specificity of the effects of interest to the remote condition, seemed to make some of the &quot;less interesting&quot; explanations like general task practice less likely.</p><p>(6) It seems that given the priming task design and as noted in #4 above, C items that were indirectly related always appeared together in the priming task, and never appeared with unrelated C items. Given this, the Reviewers thought that the behavioral results could not distinguish between the integration of the related C items in particular (i.e., those that occurred at the end of the same sequence), as opposed to a more general integration of all C items with one another (i.e., perhaps all end-of-sequence items become more similar; point raised originally by R3). Can the authors speak to this concern? If the authors can perform some control analysis to address this issue, that would be ideal. If not, then acknowledgment of a limitation about lack of behavioral specificity for the related C's (in particular, vs. the C items overall) becoming integrated or differentiated would be warranted.</p><p>(7) Please be cautious in phrasing with respect to the connectivity changes as a result of learning. In particular be sure they are not being discussed as &quot;reactivation,&quot; which the Reviewers all agreed was not measured directly (a point raised originally by R3).</p><p>(8) In the Introduction, two Reviewers (R1 and R2) thought it would be worth better motivating the regions of interest (why posterior but not anterior hippocampus; and why LOC and not mPFC?). Please consider these suggestions in revising your Introduction.</p><p>(9) Reviewers would like to see a sharper distinction between planned and exploratory analysis, and multiple comparisons correction for exploratory (R2).</p><p>(10) If the authors see fit, they may want to comment on the implicit/explicit distinction. In particular, it would be helpful to know whether they think the explicit elements in their task (e.g., like recognition memory judgments in the priming task) are crucial to the findings (R2), in light of how systems consolidation models are generally conceptualized as pertaining more to explicit memory (R3).</p><p>(11) Reviewers had numerous other suggestions and questions, which I would ask the authors to additionally consider.</p><p><italic>Reviewer #1 (Recommendations for the authors):</italic></p><p>(1) Did the posterior hippocampus show a change in neural integration for either recent or remote (as shown for the anterior in Supplemental Figure 6)? Would be nice to report this for completeness.</p><p>(2) p. 6 – here they focus on posterior hippocampus connectivity with category-sensitive regions of the neocortex, which I think is fine. They note also that this choice is exploratory. But, they in their motivation do not really touch on the fact that integration itself has generally been more ascribed to the anterior hippocampus-so it seems to me that there is a possibility that either region could be important, and if the authors want they could perhaps set those dual possibilities up. Perhaps replay via the posterior hippocampus of the single events with later integration in the neocortex is one mechanism, but online integration &amp; replay of those associations (perhaps more of an anterior hippocampus operation) is another. It then perhaps becomes clearer why it is interesting that the authors find the effect specific to the posterior hippocampus, with nothing much going on in the anterior. Could the work speak to these two possibilities (i.e., the findings seem more consistent with the first possibility of immediate storage for the memories separately, and offline integration via reactivation of the constituent traces)? Alternatively, might the authors explain why they think integration per se in the anterior hippocampus seen in previous work should not be related to the post-encoding connectivity profile?</p><p>(3) p. 7, line 142 – It was not clear to me why RT (per se, or in all cases) is an ideal readout of memory integration.

Or, if all trials, it would be helpful to clarify why the decision to include incorrect trials as well.</p><p>(6) It took me a while to work out exactly how the priming task was set up, and I think more details in the main paper would have been useful. It was unclear to me until I read the Methods that every sequence had one C item that appeared in the &quot;primed&quot; condition and one in the &quot;control&quot; condition (and that, as noted above, the control transition always has to happen first, by definition). I think it would be helpful to be more specific in the main paper about the critical comparison-specifically, more on the control condition. On first read, I was not sure whether C trials preceded by novel foils were used as a control (which would not be ideal, but I don't think this is what the authors did). I think baseline objects were old objects and were presented an equal number of times as the C items (based on p. 35); putting this in the main text would have been so helpful. It might also be helpful to note that each object appeared just once in the priming task, to help readers get a sense of how many trials/sequences (or the max #) go into each comparison.</p><p>(7) I was a bit confused about the use of the words &quot;baseline&quot; and &quot;control&quot; objects (e.g., on p. 11)-it seemed at times the terms were being used interchangeably, and in other places, the baseline objects were what made up the control condition.</p><p>(8) p. 13 – at the end of the section on priming, possibly worth qualifying the final sentence to note the effect of order as being present (interestingly) only for the remote sequences?</p><p>(9) p. 13, line 317 – where it says accuracy was reliably above chance, I think that means there is significant evidence for integration (more familiarity for intact vs. rearranged pairs), but I wasn't totally sure since it wasn't called accuracy earlier. Please clarify.</p><p>(10) For p. 15 – &quot;all object images&quot; presented during the pre- and post-learning exposure phases: I assume this is all objects from the remote and recent learning tasks, not the novel foils from the priming task.</p><p>(11) p. 17 – I was confused about this partial correlation control analysis. Did this analysis use a similar approach to the main analysis, where the authors took some kind of average score per participant? (Would that be average across the matrix diagonal, i.e., between all pairs of related C objects?) Or, was this somehow used to control for differences in BOLD signal between C1 and C2 in a trial-by-trial way?</p><p>(12) p. 38 – &quot;Accuracy computed for any learning trial in which the preceding object was coded to be a different size (e.g. an object bigger than a shoebox following an object smaller than a shoebox), as comparisons amongst objects that were both bigger or both smaller are likely more variable and dependent on participants' subjective opinion.&quot; line 987-990 – is there a portion (clause? verb?) of this sentence missing?</p><p>(13) p. 39 – what instructions were given prior to the explicit memory test, especially on how to do the C1-C2 association trials?</p><p>(14) I thought it was interesting that the authors decided to match the C1 and C2-related objects in terms of size judgment so that the motor history was the same. I was curious as to whether the authors thought this might have encouraged integration since both objects point toward the same response (vs. a case where differentiating the two objects might be more important, as when the response depends on object identity). Just a thought!</p><p>(15) The authors were generally very thorough in their references to the literature, but they might want to consider citing these additional papers that are relevant: Abolghasem et al.

Could the authors briefly comment on whether they believe their results generalize to entirely implicit settings with no such explicit temporal binding or explicit memory demands?</p><p><italic>Reviewer #3 (Recommendations for the authors):</italic></p><p>(1) The validity of the observed behavioral priming effect could be more rigorously tested to improve the interpretation. Currently, the authors compare the reaction times of target C2 preceded by C1 from the overlapping sequence (prime condition), with a condition where C1 is preceded by a baseline object that is not a part of any sequence (control condition). Do they still see a priming effect when C1 is preceded by a C object from a non-overlapping sequence instead of the baseline objects (is this even possible with the task design)? This would test the specificity of the priming effect. If C objects are integrated due to the overlapping components of their sequences, one should observe priming in this condition but not when preceded by C objects from non-overlapping conditions. Alternatively, C objects could all be integrated with each other due to some other dimension of the task, such as the fact that C objects are presented less frequently than A or B or are less predictable in general than B, etc.</p><p>(2) It would be helpful to get a sense of the overall model fits for the neural data to the integration model in the mPFC and LOC, as we only see the change in fit, making it difficult to understand how well these models fit the data in the first place. In addition, could a decrease in fit be due to integration occurring across C items from non-overlapping sequences, instead of differentiation of C items from overlapping sequences?</p><p>(3) For the neural measures related to the priming section (page 23), I was confused as to why the authors took a model comparison approach to determine the unique variance explained by each predictor. Isn't it the case that when you include both similarity and connectivity in the model, if both remain significant predictors, they explain unique variance in priming? You could then calculate the semi-partial R2 to determine exactly how much unique variance is explained by each. I point this out because model comparisons are anti-conservative given that a model with more predictors will inherently explain more variance than a model with fewer predictors.</p><p>(4) The authors frequently refer to their connectivity results as reflecting post-encoding reactivation. I understand that there is evidence from other studies that reactivation occurs during the post-encoding period, but the authors have not shown this (I believe one would need to see patterns evident of encoding being reinstated during the post-encoding period). It would be more accurate to refer to the results in terms of post-encoding coupling rather than reactivation throughout, so as not to over-interpret in light of the data.</p></body></sub-article><sub-article article-type="reply" id="sa2"><front-stub><article-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.84359.sa2</article-id><title-group><article-title>Author response</article-title></title-group></front-stub><body><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Essential Revisions:</p><p>(1) Reviewers agreed that more data on the neural integration/differentiation effects are key to evaluating the findings (points originally raised by Reviewer 1, comment 2 [R1.2] and R3).

However, because we pseudo-randomly intermixed the order of sequences and baseline objects, a large portion of the comparisons participants made would be between two big objects or two small objects, and in these cases, there may not be an objectively correct answer, meaning we were not able to identify whether participants answered any incorrectly.

We also changed all mentions of ‘items’ to ‘objects’ for more consistency in terminology.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>(8) p. 13 – at the end of the section on priming, possibly worth qualifying the final sentence to note the effect of order as being present (interestingly) only for the remote sequences?</p></disp-quote><p>Thank you for this suggestion – we have modified that section to highlight that our findings are only for the remote sequences (now on page 15 line 365).</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>(9) p. 13, line 317 – where it says accuracy was reliably above chance, I think that means there is significant evidence for integration (more familiarity for intact vs. rearranged pairs), but I wasn't totally sure since it wasn't called accuracy earlier. Please clarify.</p></disp-quote><p>We see have modified this section to use the term behavioral integration rather than accuracy, which makes for more consistent language across the two experiments (pages 15-16, lines 381-382 and 387-389).</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>10. For p. 15 – &quot;all object images&quot; presented during the pre- and post-learning exposure phases: I assume this is all objects from the remote and recent learning tasks, not the novel foils from the priming task.</p></disp-quote><p>Correct – we have clarified this (Page 17, lines 421-422).</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>(11) p. 17 – I was confused about this partial correlation control analysis. Did this analysis use a similar approach to the main analysis, where the authors took some kind of average score per participant? (Would that be average across the matrix diagonal, i.e., between all pairs of related C objects?) Or, was this somehow used to control for differences in BOLD signal between C1 and C2 in a trial-by-trial way?</p></disp-quote><p>Thank you for highlighting our need to clarify this section. This was done on a pair-by-pair manner, by creating a matrix with the same order of C1 and C2 objects with cells that capture the difference in average BOLD signal between each pair of objects. Then this matrix was re-arranged into a vector (in the same manner as the elements of the neural integration model and the similarity matrix for a given ROI and session) and entered into partial correlation analyses. The output of this analysis is a measure of fit for each participant, between neural data and the model, while accounting for BOLD signal. These fits could then be analyzed in the same manner as the main analyses.</p><p>We have taken steps to clarify this analysis in a few ways. First, we added a paragraph in the Methods section that described this analysis in more detail (pages 52-53, lines 1402-1414). Second, we summarized and clarified the conceptual aim of the analysis in the Results section (page 20, lines 505-512).</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>(12) p. 38 – &quot;Accuracy computed for any learning trial in which the preceding object was coded to be a different size (e.g. an object bigger than a shoebox following an object smaller than a shoebox), as comparisons amongst objects that were both bigger or both smaller are likely more variable and dependent on participants' subjective opinion.&quot; line 987-990 – is there a portion (clause? verb?) of this sentence missing?</p></disp-quote><p>This was a typo and has been fixed: “Accuracy <italic>was</italic> computed for…”</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>(13) p. 39 – what instructions were given prior to the explicit memory test, especially on how to do the C1-C2 association trials?</p></disp-quote><p>The instructions for this test were very explicit: “You may have noticed that during the size task, some objects often appeared in sequences. For instance, maybe two objects always appeared back-to-back, Or, maybe two objects were always preceded by the same sequence.” This was accompanied by a visualization of a pair of overlapping ABC1 and ABC2 sequences. They were then instructed to perform the task based on how familiar each pair of objects felt specifically based on the sequence information they learned during learning. We have included this extra information to the Methods section (page 46, lines 1230-1235 for Expt 1 and pages 49-50, lines 1316-1317 for Expt 2).</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>(14) I thought it was interesting that the authors decided to match the C1 and C2-related objects in terms of size judgment so that the motor history was the same. I was curious as to whether the authors thought this might have encouraged integration since both objects point toward the same response (vs. a case where differentiating the two objects might be more important, as when the response depends on object identity). Just a thought!</p></disp-quote><p>We did think about motor history as a possible contributor to integration or differentiation, which is why we decided to match the size judgments for C1 and C2 objects from overlapping sequences. We don’t have concrete evidence that motor history would impact the ability to integrate across sequences, but we decided on this path to reduce variability and potential sources of differentiation. We would be interested in testing this systematically in the future!</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>(15) The authors were generally very thorough in their references to the literature, but they might want to consider citing these additional papers that are relevant: Abolghasem et al.

The discussion is much more nuanced as a result (page 33, lines 865-868; page 32, lines 847-854).</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>(6) The sequence learning (i.e., size judgment) task puts a strong emphasis on the temporal relationships between items, and the priming task has a strong explicit recognition memory component. Could the authors briefly comment on whether they believe their results generalize to entirely implicit settings with no such explicit temporal binding or explicit memory demands?</p></disp-quote><p>This is a great open question. Our intuition is that the results would also generalize to an implicit setting, but without an explicit temporal binding, their ability to learn the sequences would take longer. In early piloting for this experiment and other experiments in the lab that examine temporal binding, it seems clear that some attention to the temporal structure is needed for the sequential information to be learned in one experimental session of a reasonable length. For example, in very early stimulus and task development for this experiment, a handful of participants were exposed to the sequences while completing a size judgment task for each image (bigger or smaller than a shoebox). Here, there was no evidence of priming, but there was also no evidence of learning ABC<sub>1</sub> and ABC<sub>2</sub> based on participants’ response times for the size judgments.</p><p>In terms of an explicit memory demand, we predict that our findings would generalize to other tasks easily. Indeed, similar measures of integration have been observed using preference ratings (Abolghasem et al., 2023), and it seems reasonable to expect that a task like a size judgment or a similar such judgment would also work. We chose a recognition task because we wanted motor responses for each item in the sequence to be matched to avoid any variability in responses due to participants changing their response across priming trials (Dobbins et al., 2004). To this end, participants responded ‘old’ to all items that were included in those analyses. However, variability due to motor responses could be accounted for in additional ways with these other tasks.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Reviewer #3 (Recommendations for the authors):</p><p>(1) The validity of the observed behavioral priming effect could be more rigorously tested to improve the interpretation. Currently, the authors compare the reaction times of target C2 preceded by C1 from the overlapping sequence (prime condition), with a condition where C1 is preceded by a baseline object that is not a part of any sequence (control condition). Do they still see a priming effect when C1 is preceded by a C object from a non-overlapping sequence instead of the baseline objects (is this even possible with the task design)? This would test the specificity of the priming effect. If C objects are integrated due to the overlapping components of their sequences, one should observe priming in this condition but not when preceded by C objects from non-overlapping conditions. Alternatively, C objects could all be integrated with each other due to some other dimension of the task, such as the fact that C objects are presented less frequently than A or B or are less predictable in general than B, etc.</p></disp-quote><p>We did not include a control condition in which C objects from different sequences appeared back-to-back, as we wished to maximize the number of comparisons in the primed condition for power purposes while only presenting each object once. Repetition of objects during the priming task may have further facilitated response times and potentially masked any priming effects. We agree that this omission leaves open the possibility that the facilitated responses to C2 may be due to an integration of all C objects due to their shared transition probabilities, and their ‘place’ as the third items in triplet sequences. However, it is encouraging that the observed priming effect for the remotely learned sequences is selectively correlated with post-learning neural similarity between C objects from overlapping sequences, and not related to similarity between C objects from different sequences (Supplemental Figure 4). It’s also worth noting that the explicit integration tests were always conducted with C objects from other sequences as foils; above-chance performance in both experiments suggests that participants successfully learned sequence-specific relationships rather than information about objects’ positions in their sequences. Regardless, we have included this outstanding question as a caveat in the Discussion (pages 40-41, lines 1087-1107).</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>(2) It would be helpful to get a sense of the overall model fits for the neural data to the integration model in the mPFC and LOC, as we only see the change in fit, making it difficult to understand how well these models fit the data in the first place. In addition, could a decrease in fit be due to integration occurring across C items from non-overlapping sequences, instead of differentiation of C items from overlapping sequences?</p></disp-quote><p>It is clear from multiple reviewers that these data would be helpful to include. We have included these model fits along with appropriate statistical tests. Please see Reviewer #1 comment #2 for more details, but as a reminder, the decrease in model fit for mPFC for the remote sequences was driven primarily by a decrease in similarity for the overlapping C items and not the non-overlapping ones. Interestingly, in LOC, all C items grew more similar after learning, regardless of their overlap or learning session, but the increase in model fit for C items in the recent condition was driven by a larger increase in similarity for overlapping pairs relative to non-overlapping ones.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>(3) For the neural measures related to the priming section (page 23), I was confused as to why the authors took a model comparison approach to determine the unique variance explained by each predictor. Isn't it the case that when you include both similarity and connectivity in the model, if both remain significant predictors, they explain unique variance in priming? You could then calculate the semi-partial R2 to determine exactly how much unique variance is explained by each. I point this out because model comparisons are anti-conservative given that a model with more predictors will inherently explain more variance than a model with fewer predictors.</p></disp-quote><p>This makes sense to us and we have changed our statistical approach accordingly. Please see page 27, lines 706-710, for updated statistics and page 55, lines 1478-1482, for Methods; the results have not changed.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>(4) The authors frequently refer to their connectivity results as reflecting post-encoding reactivation. I understand that there is evidence from other studies that reactivation occurs during the post-encoding period, but the authors have not shown this (I believe one would need to see patterns evident of encoding being reinstated during the post-encoding period). It would be more accurate to refer to the results in terms of post-encoding coupling rather than reactivation throughout, so as not to over-interpret in light of the data.</p></disp-quote><p>We have modified our terminology to use ‘post-encoding coupling’ rather than ‘reactivation’ throughout the manuscript, as it is not a direct measure of reactivation of specific memories. We also, however, clarify our use of hippocampal-cortical coupling as one of several indexes of post-learning reactivation in the Introduction (page 5, lines 95-101). While hippocampal-cortical coupling cannot capture stimulus-specific reactivation, it is selective to category-selective cortical regions (de Voogd et al. 2016; Murty et al. 2017) and selective post-learning rest periods rather than pre-learning indices of coupling, making it a likely signature of coordinated reactivation across hippocampus and cortex.</p></body></sub-article></article>
