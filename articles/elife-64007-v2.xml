In this way the fungal core circadian oscillator shares a common regulatory architecture with the mammalian core clock. In Neurospora, the circadian negative arm complex is composed of FRQ and FRQ-interacting RNA helicase (FRH), which together bring casein kinase I (CKI) to promote phosphorylation of WCC on key phospho-sites to inhibit its activity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib76">Wang et al., 2019</xref>). FRQ is extensively regulated transcriptionally, translationally, and post-translationally over the circadian day leading ultimately to its inactivation (reviewed in: <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Hurley et al., 2016</xref>).</p><p>Indeed, in both animals and fungi, the negative arm components are regulated at the RNA and protein levels to maintain circadian phase and period, and many of the molecular details of this regulation, the focus of this paper, are conserved. Negative arm components FRQ and PER are regulated by anti-sense transcription (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">Koike et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">Kramer et al., 2003</xref>), by thermally regulated splicing (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Colot et al., 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib47">Majercak et al., 1999</xref>), and display characteristics of intrinsically disordered proteins (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib59">Pelham et al., 2020</xref>). Another highly conserved feature of fungal, insect, and mammalian negative arm components is progressive phosphorylation leading to their inactivation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Baker et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib56">Ode et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib74">Vanselow et al., 2006</xref>) (reviewed in: <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Dunlap and Loros, 2018</xref>). Taken together, FRQ, PERs, and CRYs are tightly regulated and underlying mechanisms are often conserved between clock models despite evolutionary sequence divergence of these negative arm components.</p><p>In contrast, less is known about the mechanisms regulating expression of the other essential member of the negative arm complex, CKI, orthologs of which are highly conserved in sequence and in function across eukaryotic clocks. CKI forms a stable complex as FRQ–FRH–CKIa in Neurospora (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Baker et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Görl et al., 2001</xref>), as PER-DOUBLETIME (DBT) in flies (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">Kloss et al., 2001</xref>), and as a multi-protein complex of PER-CRY-CKIδ in mouse (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Aryal et al., 2017</xref>). Fungal CKI phosphorylates both FRQ and WCC (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">He et al., 2006</xref>). Insect DBT and mammalian CKIδ/ε are key regulators of the PER2 phospho-switch, differentially phosphorylating two regions that control PER2 turnover (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib71">Top et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib85">Zhou et al., 2015</xref>). Thus, CKI phosphorylations contribute to feedback loop closure in all species. FRQ–CKI binding strength is a key regulator of period length and an important oscillator variable first described in Neurospora (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib45">Liu et al., 2019</xref>). CKI abundance is not rhythmic in any species described to date (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Görl et al., 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">Kloss et al., 2001</xref>), but preliminary evidence suggests that its expression levels are tightly controlled to keep the clock on time, just like FRQ/PER/CRY. In mammals, CKI knockdown or knockout significantly lengthens period (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">Isojima et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib42">Lee et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib73">Tsuchiya et al., 2016</xref>), and CKIδ levels are negatively regulated by m6A methylation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Fustin et al., 2018</xref>). In Neurospora, decreasing the amounts of the <italic>casein kinase I</italic> (<italic>ck-1a</italic>) transcript using a regulatable promoter leads to long period defects up to ~30 hr (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib49">Mehra et al., 2009</xref>). CKI has a conserved C-terminal domain involved in autophosphorylation and inhibition of kinase activity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Gietzen and Virshup, 1999</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Guo et al., 2019</xref>). Fungal mutants lacking this CKI C-terminal inhibitory domain have hyperactive kinase activity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib62">Querfurth et al., 2007</xref>). Across clock models, the circadian period is sensitive to CKI abundance and activity due to its importance in circadian feedback loop closure.</p><p>Our modern understanding of the circadian clock was founded on genetic screens and characterization of mutants with circadian defects (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Feldman and Hoyle, 1973</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">Konopka and Benzer, 1971</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib63">Ralph and Menaker, 1988</xref>). The fungal clock model <italic>Neurospora crassa</italic> has been a top producer of relevant circadian mutants due to its genetic tractability, ease of circadian readout, and functional conservation with the animal circadian clock (reviewed in: <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib46">Loros, 2020</xref>). Forward genetic screens used the <italic>ras-1<sup>bd</sup></italic> mutant background (which forms distinct bands of conidiophores once per subjective night) in race tube (RT) assays to identify key players in the circadian clock (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Belden et al., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Feldman and Hoyle, 1973</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib66">Sargent et al., 1966</xref>). Genetic epistasis among the <italic>period</italic> genes, and in some cases, genetic mapping of mutations was also performed using <italic>N. crassa</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Feldman and Hoyle, 1976</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Gardner and Feldman, 1981</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib53">Morgan and Feldman, 2001</xref>).

Among the available <italic>prd</italic> genes, only <italic>prd-2</italic> (<italic>period-2</italic>) remains uncharacterized.</p><p>We have mapped the <italic>prd-2</italic> mutation to NCU01019 using whole genome sequencing, and discovered its molecular identity; however, attributing its long period mutant phenotype to molecular function has remained elusive (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">Lambreghts, 2012</xref>). Equipped with the identity of PRD-2, we then followed up on the observation that the <italic>upf1<sup>prd-6</sup></italic> short period phenotype is completely epistatic to the <italic>prd-2</italic> mutant’s long period (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib52">Morgan and Feldman, 1997</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib53">Morgan and Feldman, 2001</xref>). We find that UPF1<sup>PRD-6</sup> and PRD-2 use distinct mechanisms to play opposing roles in regulating levels of the <italic>casein kinase I</italic> transcript in Neurospora, thus rationalizing the circadian actions of the two clock mutants whose roles in the clock were not understood. PRD-2 stabilizes the <italic>ck-1a</italic> mRNA transcript, and the clock-relevant domains and biochemical evaluation of the PRD-2 protein indicate that it acts as an RNA-binding protein. We genetically rescue the long period phenotype of <italic>prd-2</italic> mutants by expressing a hyperactive CKI allele and by titrating up <italic>ck-1a</italic> mRNA levels using a regulatable promoter. The endogenous <italic>ck-1a</italic> transcript has a strikingly long 3’-UTR, indicating that its mRNA could be subject to NMD during a normal circadian day. We confirm that <italic>upf1<sup>prd-6</sup></italic> mutants have elevated levels of <italic>ck-1a</italic> in the absence of NMD, and further rescue the short period defect of <italic>upf1<sup>prd-6</sup></italic> mutants by titrating down <italic>ck-1a</italic> mRNA levels using an inducible promoter. Taken together, a unifying model emerges to explain the action of diverse <italic>period</italic> mutants, where the <italic>casein kinase I</italic> transcript is subject to complex regulation by NMD and an RNA-binding protein, PRD-2, to control its gene expression and maintain a normal circadian period.</p></sec><sec id="s2" sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><sec id="s2-1"><title>An interstitial inversion identifies <italic>prd-2</italic></title><p>Genetic mapping and preliminary analyses identified <italic>prd-2</italic> as a recessive mutant with an abnormally long ~26 hr period length that mapped to the right arm of LG V (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib52">Morgan and Feldman, 1997</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib53">Morgan and Feldman, 2001</xref>). Genetic fine structure mapping using selectable markers flanking <italic>prd-2</italic>, in preparation for an anticipated chromosome walk, revealed an extensive region of suppressed recombination in the region of the gene, consistent with the existence of a chromosome inversion (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">Lambreghts, 2012</xref>). PCR data consistent with this prompted whole genome sequencing that revealed a 322 kb inversion on chromosome V (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">Lambreghts, 2012</xref>) in the original isolate strain hereafter referred to as <italic>prd-2<sup>INV</sup></italic>. The left breakpoint of the inversion occurs in the 5’-UTR of NCU03775, and its upstream regulatory sequences are displaced in the <italic>prd-2<sup>INV</sup></italic> mutant. However, a knockout of NCU03775 (FGSC12475) has a wild-type circadian period length, unlike the long period <italic>prd-2<sup>INV</sup></italic> mutant (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1</xref>). The next closest gene upstream of the left inversion is NCU03771, but its transcription start site (TSS) is &gt;7 kb away. The right breakpoint of the inversion occurs in the 5’-UTR of NCU01019, disrupting 333 bases of its 5’-UTR and its entire promoter region (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1A and B</xref>).

The C-terminus of PRD-2 is predicted to be highly disordered, and finer mapping of this region showed that neither a glutamine/proline-rich domain (amino acids 525–612, 21% Gln, 26% Pro) nor a domain conserved across fungal orthologs (amino acids 625–682, 21% Pro) were required for normal clock function (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2C</xref>). The remainder of the C-terminus (amino acids 495–524, 28% Pro; 683–790, 24% Pro) contains a clock-relevant region of PRD-2 based on deletion analyses. Further, PRD-2 SUZ domain and C-terminal deletion mutants are expressed at the protein level, indicating that clock defects must be due to the absent domain (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s1">Figure 2—figure supplement 1A</xref>).

The mammalian PER2 anti-sense transcript displays nearly identical dynamics to <italic>qrf</italic> expression (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">Koike et al., 2012</xref>).

In a similar manner, <italic>frq</italic> RNA is directly targeted for turnover by rhythmic exosome activity in the late day (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Guo et al., 2009</xref>).

Mammalian PER2 is also largely intrinsically disordered, and indeed circadian clock proteins across species have large stretches of intrinsic disorder which are in the early stages of functional characterization (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib59">Pelham et al., 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib58">Pelham et al., 2018</xref>) (reviewed in: <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib57">Partch, 2020</xref>).

To our knowledge the discovery of NMD regulation of CKI represents a wholly novel and potentially important mode of regulation for this pivotal kinase. Future work will investigate whether insect DBT and/or mammalian CKIδ/ε (CSNK1D, CSNK1E) are also targets of NMD. Long UTR length appears to be conserved across CKI orthologs (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5s2">Figure 5—figure supplement 2</xref>). One previous study in <italic>Drosophila</italic> reported a circadian period defect in a tissue-specific NMD knockdown (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib64">Ri et al., 2019</xref>), but the behavioral rhythm was lengthened in UPF1-depleted insects unlike the short period defect observed in Neurospora. In mouse, both CKIε and CLOCK display altered splicing patterns in the absence of UPF2 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib77">Weischenfeldt et al., 2012</xref>). Most core clock proteins have at least one uORF in mammals (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib51">Millius and Ueda, 2017</xref>), altogether raising the possibility that multiple core clock genes are regulated by NMD. The importance of NMD has already been recognized and investigated in the plant clock, where alternative splicing leads to NMD turnover for four core clock and accessory mRNAs: GRP7, GRP8, TOC1, and ELF3 (reviewed in: <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib48">Mateos et al., 2018</xref>).</p><p>CKI abundance and alternative isoforms strongly affect circadian period length. Low levels of CKI driven from an inducible promoter lead to long periods approaching 30 hr (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib49">Mehra et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4A</xref>). In the mammalian clock, decreased CKI expression also significantly lengthens period (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">Isojima et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib42">Lee et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib73">Tsuchiya et al., 2016</xref>). CKI is rendered hyperactive by removing its conserved C-terminal domain, a domain normally subject to autophosphorylation leading to kinase inhibition (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Gietzen and Virshup, 1999</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Guo et al., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib62">Querfurth et al., 2007</xref>). We generated a CKI mutant expressing only this shortest CKI isoform, finding a 17.5 hr short period phenotype in the absence of C-terminal autophosphorylation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4B</xref>). Based on prior work, increased CKI activity and/or abundance would be expected to increase FRQ-CKI affinity and lead to faster feedback loop closure (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib45">Liu et al., 2019</xref>), consistent with the short period phenotype. Curiously, this CKI short isoform is expressed at levels similar to the full length isoform in Neurospora (as well as a third short isoform derived from an alternative splice acceptor event) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5F</xref>), and all isoforms interact with FRQ by immunoprecipitation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib62">Querfurth et al., 2007</xref>). Why do natural isoforms arise without the auto-inhibitory C-terminus in Neurospora, and are these regulatory events required to keep the clock on time? Mammalian alternative isoforms <italic>CKIδ1 and CKIδ2</italic> have different substrate preferences in vitro, which leads to differential phosphorylation of PER2 whereby CKIδ2 phosphorylation significantly stabilizes PER2 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Fustin et al., 2018</xref>). Adding further complexity, <italic>CKIδ1 and CKIδ2</italic> isoform expression patterns appear to be tissue specific and are regulated by m6A RNA modification.

CKI overexpression is pathogenic in Alzheimer’s disease in addition to its role in circadian period regulation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib68">Sundaram et al., 2019</xref>). Mutation of hPER2 at residue S662 is associated with the human sleep and circadian disorder FASPS (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib70">Toh et al., 2001</xref>), and CKIδ/CKIε kinases control the phosphorylation state of this critical site as well as phospho-switch regions dictating PER2 stability (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib55">Narasimamurthy et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib60">Philpott et al., 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib85">Zhou et al., 2015</xref>).

Your article has been reviewed Detlef Weigel as Reviewing and Senior Editor and three reviewers. The following individuals involved in review of your submission have agreed to reveal their identity: Matthew S. Sachs (Reviewer #2).</p><p>I am happy to say that the reviews were uniformly positive. To paraphrase some of the comments: You are providing a convincing answer to a longstanding question concerning how a mutation affecting nonsense mediated mRNA decay (NMD) in <italic>Neurospora crassa</italic> causes a change in period length of the circadian clock. You explain this effect by revealing that the CKI gene encoding a conserved, central clock regulator, casein kinase I, is regulated at the level of RNA stability by the NMD mechanism. Specifically, you elegantly demonstrate that the prd-2 mutation affects an RNA binding protein that binds to the CKI transcript and protects it from NMD. These are exciting findings that are conveyed in a clear and cohesive manner.</p><p>I am including the three reviews in full below. As you will see, the reviewers had several major points:</p><p>1) Because of the PERIOD (PER) gene in animals has the same name as period (per) loci in Neurocrassa, it is important to make clear that per-2 is a completely different locus than one of the PER loci (especially since there is a PER2 in vertebrates. As a dyed-in-the-wool geneticist I believe in the primacy of genetics and am a fan of original gene names, but in this specific case, I would encourage you to rename per-2 as upf1.</p><p>2) In addition, an even tighter focus on the clock in general would make the work more accessible to <italic>eLife</italic>'s broad audience.</p><p>3) The reviewers also suggest a couple of experiments for the future; should you already have relevant data you wish to include I would invite you to do so. If you mention this, please do so prominently in the cover letter of the revision, so that I can have a look at them myself, since I am not intending to send this out for re-review.</p><p>4) Finally, I am happy that we had prior to this submission a Discussion of what would be needed to make the work a likely <italic>eLife</italic> candidate, and I am delighted that this has worked out well.</p><p>We would like to draw your attention to changes in our revision policy that we have made in response to COVID-19 (https://elifesciences.org/articles/57162). Specifically, we are asking editors to accept without delay manuscripts, like yours, that they judge can stand as <italic>eLife</italic> papers without additional data, even if they feel that they would make the manuscript stronger. Thus the revisions requested below only address clarity and presentation.</p><p><italic>Reviewer #1:</italic></p><p>This manuscript presents the identification of the <italic>Neurospora</italic> period-2 allele and reveals its role in stabilization of the mRNA for the core clock gene casein kinase 1a (ck1a). This discovery fits in nicely with prior observations of another period allele, prd-6, that promotes degradation of ck1a mRNA by nonsense-mediated decay (NMD) to collectively implicate control of ck1a mRNA stability as a critical point in circadian period determination in Neurospora. Overall, the study provides a balanced and rigorous experimental approach and thoughtfully describes the findings in the context of the <italic>Neurospora</italic> clock and functionally related clocks in other organisms. This is an exciting finding conveyed in a clear and cohesive manner that warrants publication in <italic>eLife</italic>.</p><p><italic>Reviewer #2:</italic></p><p>Kelliher et al., convincingly answer a longstanding question concerning how a mutation affecting nonsense mediated mRNA decay (NMD) in <italic>Neurospora crassa</italic> causes a change in the period length of the organism's circadian rhythm. They identify a crucial clock-control gene, casein kinase I, as the RNA-level target of NMD. Furthermore, they determine that the previously uncharacterized circadian mutant prd-2, encodes an RNA binding protein that binds to the CKI transcript and protects it from NMD. Their data provide a molecular explanation for formal genetic epistasis relationships that have gone unexplained for decades and furthermore provide additional bases for considering the role of NMD in maintaining circadian rhythms in other eukaryotes.</p><p>Essential revisions:</p><p>1) Readers will likely wonder why the regions defining the PRD2 binding site(s) on the CK1 transcript were not more precisely identified. There is discussion concerning lack of conserved sequences (Figure 3—figure supplement 1 legend) but this point is not fully clarified for CKI which is demonstrated by CLIP to interact with PRD2.</p><p>2) Looking at Querforth, 2007 (their Figure 1A, iii and iv): the short CKI form would be produced from transcripts containing 3'UTR introns and would be predicted to be subject to EJC-mediated NMD and to long 3'UTR NMD; their Figure 1A i and ii transcripts would be subject to long 3'UTR NMD but not to EJC-mediated NMD. I think these points could be elaborated in terms of how CKI transcripts could be degraded by NMD – they may be relevant to PRD2 mechanism of protection.</p><p><italic>Reviewer #3:</italic></p><p>This manuscript identifies the genetic basis of circadian phenotypes in two long-described mutants of <italic>Neurospora crassa</italic>, Period-2 and Period-6, as defects in regulating the stability of the ck1a transcript (encoding Casein Kinase I). The period-2 mutant identifies a locus that encodes an RNA binding protein that stabilizes the ck1a message; in the mutant the stabilizing protein is absent, ck1a levels are low, and circadian period is long. Experiments demonstrated that the low level of ck1a is sufficient to explain the phenotype. Genetic experiments indicated that the period-2 mutant is in the same pathway as period-6, which was known to encode a component of nonsense-mediated decay. They tested some hypotheses, which proved correct, that the relevant target in period-6 is also ck1a. In the period-6 mutant CK1 levels are too high. The experiments are thoughtful and thorough, and clearly presented. Concerns about the manuscript relate to presentation and suitability for a broad audience.</p><p>1) Although the mutant is named period-2, the gene and protein should be given a functionally related name that won't be confused with period (per), the single most famous gene in the circadian rhythms field. Particularly period2 (per2), is the most clock-impactful of the three mammalian period genes. It is difficult enough for those outside the circadian field to navigate the components without having the same name, albeit with a different abbreviation, used for non-homologous components.</p><p>2) The approachability for a broad audience is also diminished by inclusion in the introduction of details related to the <italic>Neurospora</italic> clock and specifically text to draw parallels to the clocks of animals (similar in outline but not homologous) that are not germane to this paper. Specifically, lines 60-74 are off-topic details (antisense RNAs to other components, intrinsic disorder) that will bog down someone outside the field. Keeping a clean focus on the role of CK1 will improve the accessibility. The universality of CK1 in the clock across kingdoms is appropriately highlighted, although some of the information along these lines in the introduction would be better moved to the Discussion.</p><p>3) One aspect of parallels drawn to the animal clock is misleading and should be reworded or removed. In line 55, FRQ is said to be functionally homologous to PERs and CRYs. The statement is not meaningful, because homology is an evolutionary term and the three proteins in question are not in any way phylogenetically conserved, and they are not even analogs, as their molecular mechanisms are not the same. They are similar in acting to oppose the activity of transcription factors. Implying something more closely linked at the molecular level is not correct.</p></body></sub-article><sub-article article-type="reply" id="sa2"><front-stub><article-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.64007.sa2</article-id><title-group><article-title>Author response</article-title></title-group></front-stub><body><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>1) Because of the PERIOD (PER) gene in animals has the same name as period (per) loci in Neurocrassa, it is important to make clear that per-2 is a completely different locus than one of the PER loci (especially since there is a PER2 in vertebrates.

We have relabeled <italic>prd-6</italic> as <italic>upf1<sup>prd-6</sup></italic> throughout (see subsection “An Interstitial Inversion Identifies <italic>prd”</italic>). As geneticists, we share the visceral reaction to suggestions about gene renaming, and so we have also corresponded with Dr. Jerry Feldman in whose laboratory the <italic>prd</italic> genes were originally isolated and named. Dr. Feldman agreed that <italic>upf1<sup>prd-6</sup> </italic>is a suitable naming convention. Furthermore, one sentence has been added in subsection “An Interstitial Inversion Identifies <italic>prd”</italic> to clarify that the commonly known mammalian and insect PERIOD gene(s) is not among the classical <italic>Neurospora period</italic> (<italic>prd</italic>) mutants. In response to reviewer 1 comment # 4, we have also added text in subsection “Nonsense Mediated Decay Impacts the Clock by Regulating CKI Levels” detailing the lack of obvious evolutionary conservation of PRD-2 beyond ascomycete fungi. Taken together, we believe that these changes will further clarify that <italic>Neurospora prd-6</italic> encodes UPF1, a conserved NMD component, that <italic>Neurospora prd-2</italic> encodes a fungal-specific RNA-binding protein, and that both PRDs are distinct from the animal PER proteins. In addition, the title now refers to this novel fungal gene by its three letter mnemonic so there should be no basis for confusion.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>2) In addition, an even tighter focus on the clock in general would make the work more accessible to eLife's broad audience.</p></disp-quote><p>We agree completely on the importance of reader accessibility. In particular, we followed the advice of reviewer # 3 to re-structure the text in the Introduction and Discussion section (comments # 2 – 3). The first two paragraphs of the Introduction were simplified to highlight the most important conserved features of the negative arm of the circadian clock, which are relevant to this work and important introductory material. Text and citations describing more specific examples of conserved post-transcriptional regulation of the negative arm were moved to a new paragraph in the Discussion. A pair of sentences describing Casein Kinase I’s central role in a sleep disorder called FASPS were moved from the Introduction to the Discussion paragraph on CKI in human health. We hope that these (largely organizational) changes have improved the accessibility of this work to our audience.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>3) The reviewers also suggest a couple of experiments for the future; should you already have relevant data you wish to include, I would invite you to do so. If you mention this, please do so prominently in the cover letter of the revision, so that I can have a look at them myself, since I am not intending to send this out for re-review.</p></disp-quote><p>As mentioned in the text above, please find new data in Figure 3–Figure supplement 2B and Figure 5figure –figure supplement 1 in response to reviewer comments.</p><p>Figure 3–Figure supplement 2 shows, by two different experimental methods, that <italic>frequency</italic> (<italic>frq</italic>) mRNA stability is not significantly altered in the D<italic>prd-2</italic> RNA-binding protein mutant, unlike the drastic decrease in stability observed for <italic>casein kinase I</italic> (Figure 3B). The new experiment demonstrates that <italic>frq</italic> RNA turnover is similar in control and D<italic>prd-2</italic> after chemical inhibition of RNA synthesis by thiolutin. This result also serves as a control for <italic>casein kinase I</italic> instability in D<italic>prd-2</italic> after thiolutin treatment shown in Figure 3B, as correctly pointed out by reviewer 2 in comment # 10 below.</p><p>As described in the main text (–Discussion section), nonsense-mediated decay (NMD) is triggered by two categories of RNA features. mRNAs that contain an intron(s) in the 3’ UTR are degraded by the NMD machinery together with the exon junction complex (EJC) and nuclear cap-binding complex (CBC). mRNAs that contain 5’ UTR uORFs and/or long 3’ UTRs are degraded by the NMD subunits alone (UPF1, UPF2, and UPF3). Reviewer #2 correctly points out that <italic>ck-1a</italic> transcripts have features of both NMD-targeting mechanisms and, reasonably, asks which pathway predominantly regulates <italic>ck-1a</italic> turnover (Comments # 2, 3, 7, 8). The new Figure 5–Figure supplement 1 provides evidence that only the NMD machinery is clock-relevant and used to regulate <italic>ck-1a</italic> levels. Using a CBC component knockout D<italic>cbp80</italic>, we show that (1) the nuclear cap-binding complex is not required for normal circadian period length, and (2) there is no genetic interaction between D<italic>prd-2</italic> (unstable <italic>ck-1a</italic>, long period) and D<italic>cbp80</italic>. Given the result in Figure 5A where all three individual NMD subunits are both short circadian period length (18 – 20 hours) and genetically epistatic to D<italic>prd-2</italic>, we propose that only the NMD machinery is required to regulate <italic>ck-1a</italic>.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>4) Finally, I am happy that we had prior to this submission a Discussion of what would be needed to make the work a likely eLife candidate, and I am delighted that this has worked out well.</p></disp-quote><p>We are equally pleased with the outcome of our discussions on revisiting the first submission of this manuscript.

Here is a full description of our informatic attempts to identify PRD-2 sequence motifs, summarized in Figure 3—figure supplement 1 legend. As described in Figure 3–figure supplement 1, we identified 292 genes downregulated significantly in D<italic>prd-2</italic> by RNA-Seq and hypothesized that, if PRD-2 acts to stabilize its targets, this group of downregulated genes contains <italic>bona fide</italic> PRD-2 targets. Of the 292 downregulated genes, 226 genes were annotated with 3’ UTR sequence coordinates and 212 genes with 5’ UTRs. Focusing specifically on 3’ UTRs due to importance in <italic>ck-1a</italic> regulation, we ran Weeder2 to identify sequence motifs within the top 30, top 50, top 70, top 100, or all 226 3’ UTRs from D<italic>prd-2</italic> downregulated genes. Zero motifs emerged with a Weeder2 score &gt; 1.5. For reference, the known binding motif “GATCG” for WCC is recovered at a Weeder2 score = 2.01 from the top 33 WCC targets by ChIP-seq, and the known binding motif “GGACCCT” for CSP-1 is recovered at a Weeder2 score = 2.44 from over 600 known targets by ChIP-seq. Inspecting the motifs scoring better than 1.3, we did identify one motif “GGATATA” among the D<italic>prd-2</italic> downregulated gene UTRs with Weeder2 scores ranging from 1.33 – 1.37 (depending on the input sequences). Curiously, a similar motif “GGATAT” does appear twice toward the end of the 3’ UTR in <italic>ck-1a</italic>, and this could be a clue to PRD-2 binding despite its relatively poor sequence enrichment score among many sequences. In future work, we will delete regions of the <italic>ck-1a</italic> 3’ UTR (including the putative PRD-2 motifs) and screen for circadian period defects.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>2) Looking at Querforth, 2007 (their Figure 1A, iii and iv): the short CKI form would be produced from transcripts containing 3'UTR introns and would be predicted to be subject to EJC-mediated NMD and to long 3'UTR NMD; their Figure 1A i and ii transcripts would be subject to long 3'UTR NMD but not to EJC-mediated NMD.

We agree completely that only CKI transcript isoforms iii and iv would be subject to 3’ UTR intron mediated degradation by NMD, EJC, and CBC. The other two isoforms (i and ii) contain long 3’ UTRs only for NMD targeting. Of note, there are also two introns located in the 5’ UTR of <italic>ck-1a</italic> (source: FungiDB), which could produce additional isoforms and/or 5’ UTR uORFs for NMD-mediated targeted degradation.</p><p>Turning to our Figure 5F, we observe by visual inspection that both the long and the short isoforms of CKI protein increase in abundance in the NMD mutant (EJC-dependent and EJC-independent degradation both absent).

To address this, we have removed the statement in question “FRQ is functionally homologous to PERs and CRYs in the animal clock” and added an explicit statement that the negative arm proteins are not phylogenetically conserved between animals and fungi in the Introduction. However, we respectfully disagree that FRQ and PER/CRY only share the molecular and functional similarity of inhibiting the positive arm transcription factors (TFs). Both FRQ and PER/CRY nucleate the negative arm complex and recruit kinases such as Casein Kinases I and II to phosphorylate and inhibit the positive arm TFs. FRQ, PERs, and CRYs are heavily post-translationally modified, and in particular progressive phosphorylation seems to be a conserved timekeeping feature of the negative arm across species. Furthermore, FRQ, PER, and CRY all contain features of intrinsically disordered proteins (IDPs), which are thought to be under less selective evolutionary pressure due to lack of structural constraints (e.g. Brown et al., 2011). Thus, lack of sequence conservation cannot be taken as evidence of lack of evolutionary relatedness of function (e.g. Brody, 2020). Based on our current understanding of circadian evolution, though, we completely agree that language should be softened on relationships between FRQ, PERs, and CRYs. We hope that revisions to the Introduction and Discussion section (please see main comment #2) alleviate this concern with the original text.</p></body></sub-article></article>
