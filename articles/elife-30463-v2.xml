Many embryonic and post-embryonic developmental processes involve stem cells that repeatedly give rise to tissue founder cells while also self-renewing at each round of division. Cell cycle regulation defines the correct timing and pacing of divisions for generating the progenitor cells, as well as maintaining the potency of stem cells themselves (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Ables and Drummond-Barbosa, 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Barker, 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib94">Yasugi and Nishimura, 2016</xref>). Understanding the cell cycle characteristics of stem cells and the implications of cell cycle regulation requires a combined lineage tracing and live-cell cycle analysis approach at single-cell resolution. However, such high-resolution lineage tracing has been challenging in many traditional and emerging animal model systems, due to a wide range of practical limitations that spans from the inaccessibility of embryos or tissues of interest, to the unavailability of tools and techniques (reviewed in <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib43">Kretzschmar and Watt, 2012</xref>). Therefore, in order to understand cycling behavior of stem cells and their progeny in vivo, studies are needed in organisms where continuous observations are feasible in intact individuals and tissues.</p><p>Spiralians are a group of Protostomes including segmented worms (Annelida), mollusks, ribbon worms, and flatworms, many of which undergo a stereotyped program of early cell divisions known as spiral cleavage (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Conklin, 1897</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">Henry, 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib48">Lyons et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib73">Seaver, 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib93">Wilson, 1892</xref>). Blastomeres that arise from spiral cleavage show determinate cell fates and a strict correlation exists between cell division timing and cell fate determination. The 4d micromere (also called M for Mesoblast) is one of the micromeres created during the fourth spiral cleavage, and it is an evolutionarily conserved blastomere across Spiralia (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib45">Lambert, 2008</xref>). In most spiralians, 4d gives rise to mesoderm, endoderm, and primordial germ cells (PGCs) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Ackermann et al., 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Gline et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib41">Kang et al., 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib48">Lyons et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib49">Meyer et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib66">Rebscher, 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib76">Shimizu and Nakamoto, 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib87">Swartz et al., 2008</xref>). Within a given species, 4d follows stereotypical division patterns. Differences across species in the 4d lineage division program have been proposed as a mechanism for obtaining the diverse body plans present across spiralians (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib48">Lyons et al., 2012</xref>). Yet, despite the immense diversity within spiralians, only a few studies have looked into the 4d lineage in detail, and some of these studies could not employ high-resolution lineage tracing due to techniques used (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Fischer and Arendt, 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Gline et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Gline et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">Goto et al., 1999b</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib48">Lyons et al., 2012</xref>). In addition, very limited data are available detailing the relationship between the 4d lineage cell cycle characteristics and the resulting differences in cell fates (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Bissen, 1995</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Bissen and Weisblat, 1989</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib79">Smith and Weisblat, 1994</xref>). Thus, the spiralian 4d lineage provides an exciting embryonic stem cell model system for linking cell fate potency, cell lineage, cell cycle, and morphogenetic processes.</p><p>Annelids (segmented worms) are a large but understudied group of spiralians containing many species with broadcast-spawning, giving large numbers of relatively small, yolk-poor and translucent embryos and larvae, which are amenable to functional developmental studies. Annelids are characterized by repeated (metameric) body parts called segments (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Balavoine, 2014</xref>). In clitellate annelids, a taxon including the leeches and earth worms (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib97">Zrzavý et al., 2009</xref>), founder cells of segmental tissues are generated during embryonic development by stem cells called teloblasts (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Anderson, 1973a</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Devries, 1973</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">1972</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">Goto et al., 1999b</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib61">Penners, 1924</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib92">Weisblat and Shankland, 1985</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib95">Zackson, 1982</xref>). Specific teloblasts make specific tissue types. The 4d micromere is the originator of the M teloblasts (mesoteloblasts) that make the trunk mesoderm: the first division of 4d generates two bilaterally symmetric stem cells named <italic>M</italic>esoteloblast-<italic>L</italic>eft (ML) and <italic>M</italic>esoteloblast-<italic>R</italic>ight (MR). ML and MR then make the left and right mesodermal <italic>bands,</italic> respectively, via a well-described division program (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib92">Weisblat and Shankland, 1985</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib95">Zackson, 1982</xref>): the teloblasts repeatedly divide asymmetrically to self-renew the ML/MR stem cells and to give rise to tissue precursor cells (primary blast cells) through iterated divisions. Each primary blast cell (much smaller in size compared to the teloblasts they have split from) follows a stereotyped program of cell divisions with fixed fate, generating clonal regions of tissues in adjoining segments. Micromere 4d and its daughters ML and MR are evolutionarily conserved embryonic stem cells across spiralians (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib45">Lambert, 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib48">Lyons et al., 2012</xref>). Their teloblastic nature in non-clitellate annelids has been suggested before (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Anderson, 1973b</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Fischer and Arendt, 2013</xref>), but direct evidence for teloblasts outside of clitellate annelids is still missing.</p><p><italic>Platynereis dumerilii</italic> is a marine annelid (Errantia, Nereididae) suitable to address the questions outlined above. As an Errant ‘Polychaete’, <italic>P. dumerilii</italic> is phylogenetically distant from clitellates (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib85">Struck et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib90">Weigert and Bleidorn, 2016</xref>) and presumably much closer in anatomy to the last common ancestor of annelids (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Balavoine, 2014</xref>). Based on comparative genome analyses, <italic>P. dumerilii</italic> has also been suggested to belong to a slow-evolving lineage, thus potentially bearing genomic ancestral features of annelids (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib63">Raible et al., 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib62">Raible and Arendt, 2004</xref>). In addition, <italic>P. dumerilii</italic> has externally fertilized, relatively fast-developing, transparent embryos which can be injected for lineage tracing and can be cultured at the lab for the full life cycle (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Ackermann et al., 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Backfisch et al., 2014</xref>). Embryos develop into free-swimming planktonic larvae in about 24 hr-post-fertilization (hpf). By 48 hpf, segmental organization starts to become apparent, mostly evident by the repetition of paired bilateral bristle bundles (chaetae) on each segment (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Fischer et al., 2010</xref>). At this stage, a mesodermal posterior growth zone (MPGZ) has formed anterior to the presumptive pygidium (the posterior-most non-segmental region), juxtaposed with the four putative PGCs (pPGCs). The MPGZ and pPGCs, as a cell cluster, sit at the converging point of the left and right mesodermal bands, and both express Vasa mRNA and protein (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib64">Rebscher et al., 2012</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib65">Rebscher et al., 2007</xref>). The first two divisions of ML and MR in <italic>P. dumerilii</italic> give rise to the pPGCs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Fischer and Arendt, 2013</xref>). However, how the MPGZ and pPGCs end up next to each other, and the exact embryonic origin of the MPGZ within the 4d lineage are not yet known. Previous studies show that the mesodermal bands, and eventually the segmental mesoderm also originate from the 4d micromere in <italic>P. dumerilii</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Ackermann et al., 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Fischer and Arendt, 2013</xref>), but whether the segmental mesoderm forms via stereotyped teloblastic divisions of primary blast cells (<italic>à la</italic> clitellate) is also unknown.</p><p>Here, using high-resolution live imaging techniques complemented with a live-cell cycle reporter we developed, we report an extensive analysis for the 4d lineage at single-cell resolution, and an investigation of cell cycling patterns of several lineages that originate from the 4d micromere. We have developed imaging techniques for both embryos and larvae that are easy to implement and can be applied to other annelids and spiralians, as well as other metazoans with ciliated larvae. We show that a pair of mesoteloblasts (ML and MR), similar to what has been observed in clitellate annelids, are active during <italic>P. dumerilii</italic> embryogenesis and that they give rise to the mesodermal derivatives and pPGCs via asymmetric cell divisions. A series of four contiguous primary blast cells produced on each side of the larva proliferate to produce mesodermal blocks that each correspond to a distinct larval hemisegment. We show that M cells, after having produced the four larval segments, undergo an abrupt transition in their cycling behavior and start dividing much more slowly and symmetrically. These final divisions of the mesoteloblasts give rise to cells that form the MPGZ in the early larvae. The MPGZ cells remain in contact with the pPGCs, which are produced earlier and arrested in G0/G1. Differences we observed in cell cycling patterns in differentially-fated lineages that originate from a single cell (4d) provide foundational information to start delineating the relationship between cell cycle regulation, cell lineage, and generation of different cell fates.</p></sec><sec id="s2" sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><sec id="s2-1"><title>Establishment of a work flow for long time-lapse live imaging and cell lineage tracing in marine embryos and larvae</title><p>Live imaging at single-cell resolution over extended time periods, and analysis of these 4D image datasets for determining cell lineages require overcoming technical barriers. In this work, we used a standard scanning confocal microscope, which allowed us to trace cells in a specific body region of the embryo. To this end, we overcame a number of specific difficulties, piecing together a complete workflow that could be applied to other marine embryos and larvae. For the immobilization of embryos and larvae, we mounted samples in a thin layer of low-melting sea-water agarose using glass-bottom dishes. After injection and a careful selection of normal developing embryos at the time of mounting, we observed normal development of all embryos and larvae in agarose. For embedding swimming stages, we developed a new deciliation protocol, allowing for permanent immobilization, even after cilia regrew (see Materials and methods).</p><p>Intense exposure to laser lights in a scanning confocal microscope caused phototoxicity problems, resulting in embryonic deaths. To solve this problem, each image stack (at a resolution of 512 × 512 pixels) was acquired in roughly 2 min and was followed by a recovery time of at least 5 min. This time seemed to allow for the natural elimination of the toxic free radicals created by the laser light, before reaching deleterious concentrations for the cells. In these conditions, we observed development of the embryos and larvae that are morphologically indistinguishable from control animals.</p><p>This time resolution (about 7 min, or longer depending on the stack thickness imaged), which helped limiting exposure of samples to the laser light, in turn limited the possibility of using automated lineage tracing. In addition, for datasets that have low time- or image-resolution, or embryos which have significantly variable cell sizes and nuclei, segmentation and lineage-tracing algorithms available via different platforms are currently not able to carry out an automated lineage analysis with high accuracy (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib89">Ulman et al., 2017</xref>). Consequently, lineage tracing in such samples still largely rely on manual curation. For determining cell lineages at single-cell resolution in <italic>Platynereis dumerilii</italic> (<italic>P. dumerilii</italic>), we used a combination of labeling techniques. In addition to the conventional nuclear and membrane labeling, we also used a live-cell cycle reporter. This added the necessary information to trace lineages accurately, making it easier to predict when a cell will divide and follow daughter cells after a division, without the need to increase time resolution and thus light exposure.</p></sec><sec id="s2-2"><title>Construction of a cell cycle reporter and analysis of its cycling patterns</title><p>In order to visualize cell cycle progression in live <italic>P. dumerilii</italic> embryos and larvae, we first constructed a fluorescent cell cycle reporter. Live-cell cycle reporters rely on fusion of a truncated cell cycle protein containing a degron motif (also called destruction box) to a fluorescent protein. As a result, the fluorescent protein becomes a visible reporter of the corresponding cell cycle phase, and gets degraded when the endogenous cell cycle protein normally gets degraded. These cell cycle reporters are also called FUCCI (<italic>f</italic>luorescent <italic>u</italic>biquitination-based <italic>c</italic>ell <italic>c</italic>ycle <italic>i</italic>ndicator) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib68">Sakaue-Sawano et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib96">Zielke and Edgar, 2015</xref>). For developing a live-cell cycle reporter in <italic>P. dumerilii</italic>, we first identified in the <italic>P. dumerilii</italic> genome and transcriptomes the <italic>cdt1</italic> gene (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1A</xref>), on which specific G1 phase reporters are based in human and zebrafish (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib68">Sakaue-Sawano et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib86">Sugiyama et al., 2009</xref>). Metazoan Cdt1 proteins contain a well-characterized degron motif called PIP box (Q-x-x-[I/L/M/V]-T-D-[F/Y]-[F/Y]-x-x-x-[R/K]) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">Havens and Walter, 2009</xref>), which interacts with the ubiquitin ligase complex CRL4 pathway for degradation. The amino acid sequence of the degron in human Cdt1 (hCdt1) is <bold><underline>Q</underline></bold>RR<bold><underline>VTDFF</underline></bold>ARR<bold><underline>R</underline></bold> and it is at position aa3-14. We found a conserved degron <bold><underline>Q</underline></bold>TS<bold><underline>VT</underline></bold>N<bold><underline>FF</underline></bold>ASR<bold><underline>K</underline></bold> at the same location in <italic>P. dumerilii</italic> amino acid sequence (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1</xref>). We also searched for a second degradation peptide, the Cy motif (aa68-70 in hCdt1), that interacts with SCF E3 ligase for degradation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Fujita, 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib55">Nishitani et al., 2006</xref>). This second degron, however, cannot be identified unambiguously in metazoan proteins (including <italic>P. dumerilii</italic>) outside of mammals. Assuming that the PIP box is the most important for <italic>P. dumerilii</italic> Cdt1 degradation, we then proceeded by fusing a large truncated Pdu-Cdt1 sequence (aa1-147) containing the PIP box degron, but excluding the other functional interaction or DNA-binding domains, to different fluorescent proteins (mVenus, mCherry, mKO2, mAG) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1A</xref>). The fused constructs were then cloned into pCS2+ expression vector, transcribed in vitro, and injected as mRNA into embryos at one-cell stage (see Materials and methods for details). Among all constructs tested, only mVenus-Cdt1(aa1-147) showed fluorescence located to the nucleus and clear cycling without producing phenotypic effects (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1B</xref>). The other constructs which had different fluorescent proteins but the same Cdt1 peptide did not produce any fluorescent signal (a problem also encountered by other researchers while establishing cell cycle reporters in other systems).</p><fig-group><fig id="fig1" position="float"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.30463.002</object-id><label>Figure 1.</label><caption><title>FUCCI cell cycle reporter for <italic>Platynereis dumerilii.</italic></title><p>(<bold>A</bold>) <italic>P. dumerilii</italic> Cdt1 complete amino acid sequence above, showing the domains including PIP destruction box (N terminal).

We first carried out a detailed time-point analysis for individual cells using live imaging. <italic>HistoneH2A-mCherry</italic> mRNA was co-injected with the <italic>mVenus-cdt1(aa1-147)</italic> mRNA for continuous nuclear labeling. The imaging was done in several embryos (n = 10, four replicates) but here we report results from a representative embryo (<xref ref-type="video" rid="fig1video1">Figure 1—video 1</xref> and <xref ref-type="video" rid="fig1video2">Figure 1—video 2</xref>). We found that mVenus-Cdt1(aa1-147) in <italic>P. dumerilii</italic> was present during G1 phase, and was then degraded, probably during S phase. In contrast to the widely used hCdt1 reporter, which is specific to G1, the <italic>P. dumerilii</italic> Cdt1 reporter started accumulating again shortly before mitosis probably in late G2 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1B</xref>, see cell ‘ab’ and then cell ‘b’ before mitosis). Consequently, mVenus signal was also present during mitosis (can be seen in <xref ref-type="video" rid="fig1video1">Figure 1—video 1</xref>, <xref ref-type="video" rid="fig1video2">Figure 1—video 2</xref>). Fluorescence was suddenly dispersed in the cytoplasm when the nuclear envelope broke down during mitosis (because the truncated chimeric protein, unlike the native Cdt1, does not bind to chromatin), and then quickly concentrated in the daughter nuclei when nuclear envelope reformed at the end of telophase. We observed contrasting cycling patterns in sister cells. As an example, nucleus ‘a’ retained the mVenus signal for more than an hour (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1B</xref>, upper row), while nucleus ‘b’ kept signal for only about 8 min (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1B</xref>, lower row). The cell ‘b’ eventually divided (at 52 min) while cell ‘a’ was still in G1/S phase. Similar cycling patterns were observed for other cycling cells in several videos we have obtained, thus establishing mVenus-Cdt1(aa1-147) as an efficient cycling marker.</p><p>Next, in order to determine more precisely when mVenus-Cdt1(aa1-147) was degraded, we used S-phase-labeling with EdU. Cdt1 protein is part of the DNA-replication complex, normally present at the beginning of S phase, but targeted for degradation during S phase in order to prevent re-replication (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Arias and Walter, 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Fujita, 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib47">Liu et al., 2004</xref>). Thus, we tested whether mVenus-Cdt1(aa1-147) signal overlapped with the EdU signal. Embryos injected with <italic>mVenus-cdt1(aa1-147)</italic> and <italic>HistoneH2A-mCherry</italic> mRNAs were incubated until 12 hr-post-fertilization (hpf), then treated with a very short pulse of EdU (3 min) and immediately fixed after quick rinsing (as EdU detection cannot be carried out live, specimens needed to be fixed). The EdU treatment was long enough to mark the S phase but too short for most of the cells to progress much further in the cell cycle. As a result, the vast majority of EdU(+) cells were expected to be in S phase at the time of sample fixation. We analyzed cell nuclei from six embryos (from two independent experiments) treated this way (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1C–D’’’</xref>). We observed that 15.6% (n = 51) of cells were positive for mVenus, mCherry and EdU, demonstrating that mVenus-Cdt1(aa1-147) was present during at least part of the S phase (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1D</xref>). Only a few cells (2.1%, n = 7) were positive for mCherry and EdU, but not mVenus, suggesting that mVenus-Cdt1(aa1-147) was degraded at some point during the S phase (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1D’</xref>). Taking into account that the vast majority but not all Edu(+) cells are also mVenus(+), this strongly suggests that mVenus-Cdt1(aa1-147) is degraded toward the end of the S phase and is no longer present as the cells enter the G2 phase. The majority of cells (75.3%, n = 247) were found to be positive for mVenus and mCherry, but lacked EdU signal (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1D’’</xref>). These cells were either in G1 or late G2 phase. Finally, cells that were only mCherry(+) marking the early G2 phase made up a smaller percentage (7%, n = 23) of all cells analyzed (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1D’’’</xref>). We further confirmed that the cell cycle reporter is working properly by analyzing the ciliated cells that are known to be terminally differentiated in the annelid swimming larvae. These cells exit the cell cycle, and thus are in G0, no longer degrading Cdt1. As expected, we observed that they accumulated mVenus-Cdt1(aa1-147), once they stopped cycling. The mVenus signal reached much higher levels than in any cycling cell and remained at high levels in these fully differentiated multiciliated cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s2">Figure 1—figure supplement 2</xref>, <xref ref-type="video" rid="fig1video3">Figure 1—video 3</xref> and <xref ref-type="video" rid="fig1video4">Figure 1—video 4</xref>).</p><p>In <italic>P. dumerilii,</italic> mVenus-Cdt1(aa1-147) reporter is present during a larger portion of the cell cycle (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1E</xref>). It is being degraded during the course of the S phase, similar to the vertebrate reporter, and it starts to accumulate again during the late G2 phase. This pattern reflects the behavior of endogenous Cdt1 degradation reported in other organisms: In human cells, Cdt1 starts getting degraded in the S phase, thus it is expected to be present at least partially during this phase (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib78">Shiomi et al., 2014</xref>). In embryonic stem cells, Cdt1 starts accumulating at the end of G2 phase, which is promoted by its interaction with Geminin (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Ballabeni et al., 2004</xref>). Even though our mVenus-Cdt1(aa1-147) construct is not specific to the G1 phase, its cycling behavior is very pronounced as the protein is at barely detectable levels in late S and early G2 phases and therefore, together with HistoneH2A-mCherry, allows to follow cell cycle progression in living embryos. We call the two constructs (HistoneH2A-mCherry and mVenus-Cdt1(aa1-147)) together ‘Pdu-FUCCI’ in the rest of this manuscript. Next, we show our results of 4d micromere lineage analysis at single-cell resolution, via live imaging combining Pdu-FUCCI with membrane labeling. The layer of information into cell cycle progression provided by mVenus-Cdt1(aa1-147) was crucial in accurate manual curation of lineages in the experiments reported below. Because we could not increase the time resolution due to phototoxicity, cell cycle progression was used for predicting cell division, and differentiating the daughter cells from the surrounding cells.</p></sec><sec id="s2-3"><title>Live imaging the cell cycling and migration behavior of putative primordial germ cells</title><p>In <italic>P. dumerilii</italic>, the mesodermal 4d micromere (also called ‘M’) gives rise to two symmetrically positioned sister cells ML (<bold>M</bold>esoblast ‘<bold>L</bold>eft’) and MR (<bold>M</bold>esoblast ‘<bold>R</bold>ight’) by symmetric cell division (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Fischer and Arendt, 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib64">Rebscher et al., 2012</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib65">Rebscher et al., 2007</xref>). The following two highly asymmetric divisions of ML and MR give rise to four small cells (1ml/r and 2ml/r), which have been suggested to form the germline (putative primordial germ cells, pPGCs). Thus, the pPGCs are the earliest lineage to segregate from 4d in <italic>P. dumerilii</italic>. pPGCs become mitotically quiescent right after birth. As a result, they can be labeled with a short pulse of EdU around their time of birth (between 3 and 8 hpf), and be detected even days after EdU incorporation as they retain undiluted EdU while the neighboring somatic cells have largely diluted EdU through multiple mitoses (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib64">Rebscher et al., 2012</xref>). We confirmed that when embryos were treated between 5 and 7 hpf or 6 and 8 hpf, and raised to 24 hpf or 48 hpf all four pPGCs were labeled with EdU under our culturing conditions (5–7 hpf treatment shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2A</xref> for samples raised until and fixed at 24 hpf, in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2B</xref> for samples raised until and fixed at 48 hpf; 6–8 hpf data not shown). When embryos were treated with EdU between 7 and 9 hpf, four out of six larvae had only two EdU-positive pPGCs at 72 hpf (data not shown), indicating that pPGCs stop incorporating EdU around this time frame. In addition, to test whether pPGCs synthesized DNA after they were born in the next 2 days of development, we carried out EdU incorporation assays after pPGCs were born, between 11 and 24 hpf (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2C</xref>) and 24 and 48 hpf (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2D</xref>). We did not detect any pPGCs positive for EdU in the larvae (n &gt; 16) in either of these treatments, confirming DNA synthesis does not take place during this time frame in the pPGCs.</p><fig id="fig2" position="float"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.30463.009</object-id><label>Figure 2.</label><caption><title>pPGCs do not incorporate EdU after they are born and retain mVenus-Cdt1(aa1-147) signal.</title><p>pPGCs (arrowheads) incorporate and retain the EdU signal (red) when treated during the time they are born (5–7 hpf), and can be easily detected at 24 hpf (<bold>A</bold>) or 48 hpf (<bold>B</bold>) due to retention of EdU.

In this and following experiments, the injection cocktail included Pdu-FUCCI and an additional EGFP construct with a cell-membrane-localization signal (EGFP-caax) for visualization of individual cell shapes. First, we injected one-cell stage embryos with Pdu-FUCCI and EGFP-caax, and imaged the larvae live at 24 hpf and 48 hpf. We found that pPGCs were mVenus-Cdt1(aa1-147) positive at 24 hpf and 48 hpf, suggesting that they are arrested in G0/G1 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2E and F</xref>). Next, in samples injected with the same cocktail but only in the D quadrant at four-cell stage, we carried out high time-resolution (every 10 min) time-lapse imaging to determine if Pdu-FUCCI could allow tracking the pPGCs (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s1">Figure 3—figure supplement 1</xref>, <xref ref-type="video" rid="fig3video1">Figure 3—video 1</xref>). We chose to inject the D quadrant only, as it eventually gives rise to the 4d lineage from which pPGCs originate. In addition, injecting only the D quadrant facilitated the observation of its descending lineages, because the rest of the embryo remained unlabeled. Starting from 8 hpf, injected embryos were imaged for about 12 hr, with 10 min intervals. Temperature conditions during live imaging were higher than 18°C (which is the usual culture temperature for <italic>P. dumerilii</italic>) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Fischer et al., 2010</xref>). Thus, development was accelerated during imaging allowing us to record a broader developmental period, while the sample had normal development (<xref ref-type="video" rid="fig3video2">Figure 3—video 2</xref>). This imaging period corresponds to the stages from stereoblastula to mid-late trochophore (roughly 8 hpf to 38 hpf at 18˚C) (See <xref ref-type="table" rid="table1">Table 1</xref> for time-points and corresponding stages at different temperatures). Using the high-resolution time-lapse video, we were able to track the pPGCs, and observed that mVenus signal persisted in pPGCs after they were born (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3A–H</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s1">Figure 3—figure supplement 1</xref> for close-ups).

imaging dataset from the sample injected in the D quadrant with Pdu-FUCCI and EGFP-caax mix. When live imaging was started, 4d cell had already divided once giving rise to the left and right mesoblasts (ML and MR), and ML and MR had divided twice giving rise to two pPGCs each (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3A–A’’</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s2">Figure 3—figure supplement 2</xref> shows the first two divisions of ML and MR in another sample). pPGCs at this stage (stereoblastula) were located on the external surface of the embryo (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3A’–A’’</xref>, <xref ref-type="video" rid="fig3video3">Figure 3—video 3</xref>, <xref ref-type="video" rid="fig3video4">Figure 3—video 4</xref>). However, soon after they were born pPGCs started moving toward each other, formed a cluster, and then moved toward the vegetal pole through epiboly (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3B’–D’’</xref>). The movement of pPGCs continued on the surface until 20 hpf (or about 5 hr of imaging –<xref ref-type="table" rid="table1">Table 1</xref>) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3D’–D’’</xref>). Then they started to position internally (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3E’–G’’</xref>), eventually assuming a postero-ventral position forming a bridge between the left and right mesodermal bands which converge at the ventral pole (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3H–H’’, 2E and F</xref>). This analysis establishes a framework for locating pPGCs through these developmental stages and allow for tracking these cells in experimental manipulation conditions such as drug treatment or cell ablation in future studies.</p></sec><sec id="s2-4"><title>Each mesodermal hemisegment is the progeny of individual blast cells produced in successive divisions</title><p>In addition to giving rise to pPGCs, 4d (M) blastomere is the origin of the trunk mesoderm in <italic>P. dumerilii</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Ackermann et al., 2005</xref>). The trunk somatic mesoderm of <italic>P. dumerili</italic> larvae is organized in three largely similar segmental blocks (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Brunet et al., 2015</xref>). Each mesodermal segment is composed of identical left and right halves called mesodermal hemisegments. In clitellate annelids, ML and MR divide asymmetrically giving rise to an anterior to posterior linear series of smaller segmental founder cells called ‘primary blast cells’ (PBCs). There are as many PBCs on each side as there are segments. Each PBC generates a metamerically iterated clonal mesodermal domain distributed over three consecutive hemisegments. However, each PBC makes ‘one hemisegment-worth’ of mesoderm (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Gline et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib91">Weisblat and Kuo, 2014</xref>). This stereotypic, anterior to posterior-oriented, asymmetric division process is termed teloblastic growth. In <italic>P. dumerilii,</italic> to determine whether the 4d lineage (after the divisions that generate pPGCs) makes the mesodermal hemisegments in the larva via the teloblastic process as in the clitellates, we followed divisions of this lineage and analyzed the origin of mesodermal cell clusters (4d lineage is summarized in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4A</xref>). If mesoderm formation in <italic>P. dumerilii</italic> follows a teloblastic process, a key expectation is the presence of clonally homogeneous mesodermal regions, each originating from one specific primary blast cell as in the clitellate annelids. To do this, we manually traced cell lineages originating from 4d blastomere in live imaging datasets using Imaris software (for details, see Materials and methods). Here we only report data for the left mesoblast (ML) (Sample A), but confirmed in other samples (Samples B and C) that MR behaves like ML (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5s1">Figure 5—figure supplement 1</xref>, <xref ref-type="video" rid="fig5video1">Figure 5—video 1</xref>, <xref ref-type="video" rid="fig5video1">Figure 5—video 2</xref>).</p><fig-group><fig id="fig4" position="float"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.30463.018</object-id><label>Figure 4.</label><caption><title>Primary blast cells give rise to clonal bocks of mesoderm.</title><p>The same sample as shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3</xref> (Sample A) was analyzed for mesodermal lineages in Bitplane Imaris. 4-cell stage embryo injected with Pdu-FUCCI (<italic>HistoneH2A-mCherry, mVenus-cdt1(aa1-147)</italic>) and <italic>EGFP-caax</italic> into D quadrant was live-imaged starting at 8 hpf every 10 min for 12 hr, from a posterior-lateral angle which enabled the tracing and visualization of the left mesoblast (ML = 4d1) lineage.

Here, we adopt a similar three-character nomenclature (rank, fate, and side) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Fischer and Arendt, 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib48">Lyons et al., 2012</xref>). For example, 5ml is the small daughter, of the fifth asymmetric division of the left M teloblast, whereas its sister cell, 5ML is the self-renewed M teloblast.</p><p><italic>P. dumerilii</italic> has three true larval segments with bundles of chaetae on each side and one cryptic anterior segment (also called ‘segment 0’ [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib69">Saudemont et al., 2008</xref>], or ‘segment I’ [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib82">Steinmetz et al., 2011</xref>]). The cryptic segment does not bear chaetae and is incorporated into the head of the larva (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Brunet et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Fischer et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib82">Steinmetz et al., 2011</xref>). We adopt the following order from anterior to posterior progression: cryptic segment, segments 1, 2, and 3. The numbered segments are already clearly identifiable in the final stacks of our videos corresponding to mid-trochophore stage, because two ectodermal pockets corresponding to chaetal sacs are starting to form in each hemisegment, and mesodermal tissues that will make the segmental musculature are starting to surround them (<xref ref-type="video" rid="fig3video1">Figure 3—video 1</xref>, last frame). We identified four clear mesodermal sub-lineages that make distinct clonal domains of segmental mesodermal precursor cells arranged in bilateral anterior to posterior series (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4D–G</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s1">Figure 4—figure supplement 1</xref>). We found that, progeny of each ‘m’ blast cell from 6ml to 8ml contributes mostly to a specific larval segment: 6ml contributes to the left larval hemisegment 1 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4E–E’’’’</xref>, <xref ref-type="video" rid="fig4video8">Figure 4—video 8</xref>, <xref ref-type="video" rid="fig4video9">Figure 4—video 9</xref>); 7ml to the left larval hemisegment 2 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4F–F’’’’</xref>, <xref ref-type="video" rid="fig4video10">Figure 4—video 10</xref>, <xref ref-type="video" rid="fig4video11">Figure 4—video 11</xref>); and 8ml to the left larval hemisegment 3 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4G–G’’’’</xref>, <xref ref-type="video" rid="fig4video12">Figure 4—video 12</xref>, <xref ref-type="video" rid="fig4video13">Figure 4—video 13</xref>). These clonal blocks were easily discernible at earlier stages of development as well (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s1">Figure 4—figure supplement 1</xref>). In addition, 5ml proliferates to give a mesodermal block located just anterior to the three true segmental blocks originating from 6ml-8ml and will possibly give rise to the mesoderm of the left cryptic larval hemisegment (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4D–D’’’’</xref>, <xref ref-type="video" rid="fig4video6">Figure 4—video 6</xref>, <xref ref-type="video" rid="fig4video7">Figure 4—video 7</xref>). These lineages are summarized in <xref ref-type="video" rid="fig4video16">Figure 4—video 16</xref>.</p><p>To confirm that the clonal blocks of cells generated by each blast cell corresponded to segmental anlagen, we bring forward additional observations. First, we further analyzed the dorso-ventral position of the clonal mesodermal clusters at the final time point (t = 72, or about 37.5 hpf of development (<xref ref-type="table" rid="table1">Table 1</xref>) of the time lapse dataset. At this time point, chaetal sacs (ectodermal structures used as anatomical markers of larval segment formation) had already started forming with a few elongating bristles evident, and each clonal mesoderm cluster from a single PBC overlapped with a pair of chaetal sacs present in each hemisegment (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s2">Figure 4—figure supplement 2A–B’</xref>,). Then we analyzed the cross-sections of the 3D stacks with the Imaris lineage spots. We found that spots marking the mesodermal lineage lie just beneath each pair of chaetal sacs within a larval hemisegment (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s2">Figure 4—figure supplement 2C–D’’</xref>), confirming that these were mesodermal cells forming the layer beneath the elongating chaetal sacs at this stage. Second, we analyzed another time-lapse movie showing the development of the trochophore larva up to a stage where segmentation becomes thoroughly apparent (26–54 hpf) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s3">Figure 4—figure supplement 3</xref>, <xref ref-type="video" rid="fig4video17">Figure 4—video 17</xref>). Mesodermal blocks were initially beneath the elongating and deepening chaetal sacs (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s3">Figure 4—figure supplement 3A–B</xref>, <xref ref-type="video" rid="fig4video17">Figure 4—video 17</xref>), but they eventually formed mesodermal pockets surrounding the chaetal sacs like sheaths (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s3">Figure 4—figure supplement 3C–D</xref>, <xref ref-type="video" rid="fig4video17">Figure 4—video 17</xref>). Interestingly, before the chaetal sacs started to elongate and sink into the mesodermal layer, clear mesodermal segment boundaries were briefly visible, in the form of dorso-ventrally stretched cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s3">Figure 4—figure supplement 3C</xref>, arrows). In other models, these boundaries have been shown to correspond to acto-myosin cables that act as active compartmental limits preventing cell mixing (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib50">Monier et al., 2011</xref>). Furthermore, in <italic>P. dumerilii</italic>, previous works have shown that segmental anlagen become distinguishable at the transcriptional level already by 34 hpf, evident by the striped pattern of gene expression in the pre-segmental mesoderm and ectoderm (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib69">Saudemont et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib82">Steinmetz et al., 2011</xref>). Thus, even though segments are not anatomically distinct yet, at the molecular level mesodermal clusters start to show evidence of segmentation. Together, these observations support early determination of segmental anlage and suggest that there is minimal (if any) mixing of mesodermal cells across segments at the stages we carried out the mesodermal cell lineage analysis and after.</p><p>We also looked into the fate of blast cells segregated prior to these segmental lineages. 1ml and 2ml (1mr and 2mr for the right side) corresponded to the bilateral pairs of pPGCs as described above (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4A–B</xref>). These cells did not divide further and stayed in the immediate vicinity of the M teloblastic cells near the vegetal pole of the embryo. 3ml and 4ml blast cells, unlike 5ml to 8ml, underwent a limited number of symmetric mitoses. These small 3ml and 4ml lineages drifted toward the animal pole. Due to the orientation of the sample during imaging, it was not possible to trace the lineages 3ml and 4ml confidently after a certain time point. Our confocal stacks cover only about 60 µm thickness (the embryos are 160 µm) from the posterior end, and the progeny of 3ml and 4ml move out of the imaged area. However, the limited information we obtained suggests they may be giving rise to anterior-most non-segmental mesodermal tissues (<xref ref-type="video" rid="fig4video2">Figure 4—videos 2</xref>–<xref ref-type="video" rid="fig4video5">5</xref>). Overall, the data support that ML shows teloblastic behavior and the progeny of mesodermal primary blast cells contribute to distinct larval segments similar to what is observed in clitellate annelids.</p></sec><sec id="s2-5"><title>Mesodermal posterior growth zone originates from 8ML and 8MR</title><p>At the eighth division of ML and MR, cells 8ML/R and 8ml/r are generated.

We next investigated the progeny of 8ML/MR (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5</xref>). We compared three separate individuals (Samples A, B, C) for the 8ML and 8MR divisions and found them to be similar in all samples (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5s1">Figure 5—figure supplement 1</xref>, <xref ref-type="video" rid="fig5video1">Figure 5—video 1</xref>, <xref ref-type="video" rid="fig5video2">Figure 5—video 2</xref>). At the time they were born, 8ML/MR were positioned immediately next to the pPGCs (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6U–U’</xref>; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s1">Figure 4—figure supplement 1</xref>; <xref ref-type="video" rid="fig4video14">Figure 4—video 14</xref>, <xref ref-type="video" rid="fig4video15">Figure 4—video 15</xref>). By mid-trochophore stage (around time points 55–60), all individuals had three cells on the left and right sides near pPGCs (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5s1">Figure 5—figure supplement 1A–C’</xref>). Two of these cells divided eventually (around the same time in the left and right sides, but not perfectly simultaneously) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5A’–A’’’</xref>; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5s1">Figure 5—figure supplement 1A’’-C’’)</xref> expanding the progeny of 8ML and 8MR to 5 cells on each side (10 total). Thus, by the last time point of our datasets (corresponding to the end of mid-trochophore stage), 8ML and 8MR had given rise to five cells each that were surrounding the four pPGCs and formed a posterior ‘bridge’ between the right and left mesodermal bands. They were positioned slightly posterior to the pPGC cluster (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5B–B’’</xref>), in the region which has been previously described as the mesodermal posterior growth zone (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib65">Rebscher et al., 2007</xref>).

The division asymmetry (based on cell size) for 4d’s two daughter cells ML and MR has been previously described using bright-field microscopy only until the seventh division (7ML/R and 7ml/r) conclusively (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Fischer and Arendt, 2013</xref>), and the divisions after this were not possible to observe due to the limitations of this imaging technique. We took advantage of high-resolution confocal imaging with injection of the fluorescent markers Pdu-FUCCI (nuclear) and EGFP-caax (cell membrane, making the cell size very easy to observe). Here, we show the imaging dataset of an embryo (Sample A, same dataset as reported above) injected into its D quadrant and live-imaged from 8 hpf until larval stages when segmental mesoderm morphology started becoming obvious (<xref ref-type="table" rid="table1">Table 1</xref>, <xref ref-type="video" rid="fig3video1">Figure 3—video 1</xref>). In the confocal stacks, we were able to investigate division of 4d lineage further than previously reported, and we analyzed the size asymmetry as well as cell division angle for this lineage.</p><p>The first division of 4d is equal, creating two sister mesoblast cells positioned bilaterally symmetrically (ML and MR) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6A–B</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s2">Figure 3—figure supplement 2</xref>). However, most of the rest of the divisions were unequal, as expected of teloblasts. The first two divisions of ML and MR, are the most unequal. They gave rise to large daughter cells (1ML, 1MR, 2ML, 2MR) and very small ones (1ml, 1mr, 2ml, 2mr). 1ml/r and 2ml/r are the pPGCs as explained above (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4A–C</xref>; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s2">Figure 3—figure supplement 2</xref>). For the next rounds of divisions, we report the data for ML in detail, but we confirmed MR behaves similarly in two more samples investigated (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5s1">Figure 5—figure supplement 1</xref>, <xref ref-type="video" rid="fig5video1">Figure 5—video 1</xref>, <xref ref-type="video" rid="fig5video2">Figure 5—video 2</xref>). After the initial divisions that gave rise to the pPGCs, the mesoblast (now named 2ML) continued to divide, budding off small cells: division of 2ML, 3ML, 4ML, 5ML were all unequal (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6E, G, J and L</xref>, respectively). However, the size difference between the two daughter cells progressively decreased. This seemed to be due to the fact that 3ml and 4ml were small precursors compared to the later segmental precursors, 5ml, 6ml (compare <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6E and G with 6J and L</xref>) but also due to the gradual decrease in size of the remaining M teloblast. Following this tendency, division of 6ML into 7ML and 7ml was roughly equal in size (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6O</xref>). We observed that 7ML then divided unequally again, giving rise to 8ML and 8ml (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6S</xref>). But, surprisingly this time, the size difference was inverted: 8ml, precursor of the mesoderm of the third segment was the large cell and 8ML, the remaining teloblast cell, was now very small. The further divisions of this remaining teloblast 8ML are essentially equal and give a cluster of quite small cells. Thus, we confirm that 4d lineage shows asymmetric divisions similar to clitellate mesoteloblasts. However, unlike in the leech, in <italic>P. dumerilii</italic> the mesodermal teloblasts decreased in size very rapidly through this eight-division sequence, and we observed a reversed asymmetry at the end of the sequence. The mesodermal teloblastic lineage (derived from 8ML/MR) that will presumably produce the segments of the juvenile thus starts from a cluster of very small cells.</p><p>As observed in previous work (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Fischer and Arendt, 2013</xref>), the orientation of divisions also sequentially shifted in a clock-wise fashion for the left mesoteloblast divisions (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6E, G, J, L, O and S</xref>, summarized in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6V</xref>), when looking from the posterior pole. Consequently, whereas the first series of precursors (pPGCs, 3ml, 4ml) were budded off roughly in the direction of the future blastopore, the later segmental precursors (5ml to 8ml) were budded off progressively more towards the anterior of the embryo, also reflecting the gradual change of size of the teloblast cell and its shifting position toward the vegetal pole.</p></sec><sec id="s2-7"><title>Divisions generating segmental mesoderm precursors happen in quick succession, then cell cycling slows down significantly</title><p>We assessed whether the divisions giving rise to segmental precursors follow some kind of ‘segmentation clock’, comparable to the way somites are produced at a regular time interval in vertebrates (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Cooke and Zeeman, 1976</xref>). This is not the case in <italic>P. dumerilii</italic> as the time interval increases gradually between divisions. Precisely, at the experimental temperatures 4ML, 5ML, 6ML, 7ML divisions happened in 30, 30, 40, and 50 mins after the preceding division, respectively. Thus, there is no ‘segmentation clock’ but a ‘segmentation oscillator’ of decreasing frequency in the embryo.</p><p>We next used the live cell cycle reporter Pdu-FUCCI to compare the cell cycling patterns of some of the different lineages that arise from the 4d micromere. To do this, mean fluorescence intensity information was extracted for each spot from the cell lineage datasets using statistics module in Imaris and these were plotted as graphs (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7A</xref>, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="fig7sdata1">Figure 7—source data 1</xref>). Each spot was manually placed inside each nucleus (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7A’</xref>), and mean fluorescence intensity of pixels within each spot was calculated for subsets of lineages (see Materials and methods for details). The measurement reflects the abundance of mVenus-Cdt1(aa1-147) protein, providing quantitation of the cycling of the construct. pPGCs stopped cycling after they were born (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figures 2</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">3</xref>; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s1">Figure 3—figure supplement 1</xref>) and as expected, a roughly linear plot, without significant valleys and peaks was obtained for these cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7B</xref>). The mesoblast ML, in contrast, had clear cycling with prominent valleys and peaks (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7B</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7s1">Figure 7—figure supplement 1A</xref>). Next, we selected a sub-lineage within primary blast lineages 7ml, and 8ml, as well as a sub-lineage within 8ML for analyzing cell cycling patterns. In segmental mesoderm lineages within 7ml and 8ml, we selected ‘equivalent’ sub-lineages based on the location of daughter cells as the primary blast cell divided (see Materials and methods for details of the lineage selection criteria). The comparison of 7ml sub-lineage to 8ml sub-lineage revealed that initially these two are out of phase (valleys and peaks do not overlap) even though cycling periodicity is similar. However, by time point 46 they become synchronized as shown by the overlapping graphs (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7C</xref>). On the other hand, 8ml and 8ML sub-lineages differ from each other drastically: 8ML has much fewer valleys and peaks (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7D</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7s2">Figure 7—figure supplement 2A–E</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7s1">Figure 7—figure supplement 1C</xref>), indicating slower cell cycling compared to 8ml (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7D</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7s2">Figure 7—figure supplement 2F–J</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7s1">Figure 7—figure supplement 1B</xref>). We have also confirmed that the cycling patterns are similar in different samples and in the right mesoblast (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7s2">Figure 7—figure supplement 2</xref>). Overall, these data show that live cell cycle reporter Pdu-FUCCI is a useful tool for revealing changing cycling signatures within lineages and across lineages.

Using these techniques and tools, we reveal previously unknown characteristics of the development of this marine annelid, in particular the fact that the daughters of the blastomere 4d (ML and MR) produce the trunk mesoderm by teloblastic divisions, as in clitellate annelids. Starting with the fifth division, each division of this pair of cells gives rise to the mesoderm of one segment. ML and MR also give rise, by their two first divisions, to the putative Primordial Germ Cells (pPGCs), and starting with the eighth round of division, to the mesodermal posterior growth zone (MPGZ), which is part of the segment addition zone (SAZ). Interestingly, the different cell types that originate from 4d (segmental mesoderm cells, posterior growth zone cells, and germ cells) show distinct cell cycle characteristics.</p><sec id="s3-1"><title>Live imaging the 4d (M) lineage in <italic>P. dumerilii</italic> with a live-cell cycle reporter</title><p>Long-term imaging at single-cell resolution for lineage analyses has been technically challenging in most spiralians including annelids.

Despite the difficulty of injections, cell lineage analyses have been carried out nevertheless. Some of the studies used DiI injections for labeling specific blastomeres and analyzing the domains they gave rise to in fixed samples, in which case there is no continuous observation by time-lapse imaging, thus no resolution at individual cell-level (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Ackermann et al., 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">Irvine and Seaver, 2006</xref>). Other studies used bright-field microscopy for live observations, but only earlier stages of development could be analyzed as cell sizes become too small at later stages to confidently follow without any labeling, and/or the larvae start moving due to ciliary band formation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Fischer and Arendt, 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib93">Wilson, 1892</xref> in two other nereidids, <italic>Nereis limbata</italic> and <italic>Platynereis megalops</italic>). As a result, behavior of specific lineages with detailed cell cycling characteristics at single-cell resolution could not be observed, and whether the lineages showed teloblastic activity in non-clitellate annelids could not be directly observed. Taking advantage of injecting mRNAs coding for fluorescently labeled proteins, confocal imaging, and specimen immobilization, we were able to live-image the 4d lineage until late trochophore stages (summarized in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8">Figure 8</xref>) and analyzed its cell cycling patterns. Overcoming the long-standing challenge of immobilization of the trochophore larvae was particularly significant, because the larvae start spinning from 15 hpf and later actively swim via several ciliary bands. Thus, live imaging for extended time periods to follow cell lineages has not been possible. Our DMSO treatment method (Materials and methods) for cilia elimination can be potentially applied to other marine ciliated larvae as well as freshwater ciliates (Balavoine, Özpolat, Duharcourt, unpublished results).</p><fig id="fig8" position="float"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.30463.048</object-id><label>Figure 8.</label><caption><title>ML lineage tree indicating known and novel sub-lineages in <italic>P. dumerilii</italic>, and comparison of <italic>P. dumerilii</italic> with the leech.</title><p>Lineage tree of cells that arise from the left mesoblast (ML) traced in Imaris is plotted in <bold>A</bold>.

However, lineages that arise right after pPGCs, the precursors of mesoderm, show diverse cell cycling patterns (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7</xref>). For example, we found early cycles of ML/R to be very short in <italic>P. dumerilii</italic> (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7s1">Figure 7—figure supplement 1A</xref>). Then cell cycle becomes slightly longer within mesodermal lineages with relatively extended G2 phase.

Our and previous observations suggest these cells make only pPGCs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Ackermann et al., 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib64">Rebscher et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib65">Rebscher et al., 2007</xref>), thus pPGCs are made separately from the segmental mesoderm lineages which arise during the subsequent divisions. Here, we refer to these cells as ‘putative’ PGCs because a continuous lineage tracing (or genetic lineage tracing) by following these progenitors into adulthood when they would form the gametes has not been carried out. However, these cells fit the PGC criteria used in other model systems: they express germline/multipotency program (GMP) genes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib40">Juliano et al., 2010</xref>) and Vasa protein, at day 4 of development they migrate anteriorly (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib64">Rebscher et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib65">Rebscher et al., 2007</xref>), they are mitotically quiescent (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figures 2</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">3</xref>) but after migration they start proliferating to make future gametes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib66">Rebscher, 2014</xref>). However, considering that some annelids can regenerate their germline (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">Herlant-Meewis, 1946</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib60">Özpolat et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib59">Özpolat et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib83">Stéphan-Dubois, 1964</xref>), these PGCs set aside early in development in <italic>P. dumerilii</italic> may not be the only source of the germ cells in this species. In particular, the ectodermal and mesodermal cells that constitute the SAZ of the juvenile worm persistently express the GMP genes such as <italic>vasa</italic>, <italic>piwi</italic> or <italic>nanos</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Gazave et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib65">Rebscher et al., 2007</xref>). It is currently not known whether the GMP is shared between these apparently different sets of cells because the program is crucial for multipotency, or whether the GMP expression in SAZ, and growth zone cells in general, reflects a persistent ability of these cells to produce germline cells. A similar situation has been described in planarians, where both the neoblast cells (the planarian stem cells) and the germ cells express <italic>piwi</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Handberg-Thorsager, 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib52">Nakagawa et al., 2012</xref>).

Only further investigation involving genetic cell tracing or cell ablation will establish whether <italic>P. dumerilii</italic> can produce (or regenerate) germline cells independently of the pPGCs discussed in this work.</p><p>4d lineage gives rise to the PGCs in other annelid species as well (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib66">Rebscher, 2014</xref>), but with some differences: in contrast to <italic>P. dumerilii</italic>, which segregates its pPGCs during the first two divisions of 4d (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8">Figure 8B</xref>), PGCs arise much later from within the segmental mesoderm lineage in clitellates studied so far, as opposed to being set aside during the earlier divisions of ML/R. For example, in the leech, blast cells 16ml/r and 18 to 23ml/r (or sm10 and sm12-22 in the leech nomenclature) give rise to both segmental mesoderm and the PGCs within the associated segments (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Cho et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib41">Kang et al., 2002</xref>) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8">Figure 8C</xref>). Cells produced by the first six divisions of 4d’s daughters contribute mostly to gut endoderm, to head and pharynx musculature, but not to the germline. Likewise, in <italic>Tubifex,</italic> PGCs originate from within the progeny of 10ml/r and 11ml/r (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib42">Kitamura and Shimizu, 2000</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib56">Niwa et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib57">Oyama and Shimizu, 2007</xref>). In other spiralians such as mollusks, pPGCs are segregated from the 4d lineage during relatively early divisions (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib66">Rebscher, 2014</xref>), for example 2ml/r in the slipper snail (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib48">Lyons et al., 2012</xref>). However, the lineage that generates the pPGCs in the slipper snail also gives rise to mesodermal cell types. At the metazoan-wide level, it has been suggested that late epigenetic specification inside trunk mesoderm is the ancestral process and that early specification, often linked to the existence of a ‘germ plasm’, has evolved independently multiple times in metazoans (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Extavour and Akam, 2003</xref>). What role these different segregation and specification patterns play, and whether they have implications in the ability to regenerate germ cells at later stages of development and in adulthood in a given species need to be further investigated.</p></sec><sec id="s3-4"><title>Formation of segmental and growth zone mesoderm in <italic>P. dumerilii</italic></title><p>We have established, for the first time, the early pattern of segmental mesoderm formation in <italic>P. dumerilii</italic> (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4</xref>, and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8">Figure 8</xref> for summary). We found that during embryogenesis, segmental precursor cell segregation is similar to that in the leech or other clitellate embryogeneses. One important difference is that, only four segments (one anterior ‘cryptic’ segment and three bristle-bearing larval trunk segments) are formed during <italic>P. dumerilii</italic> embryonic/larval development. This is in sharp contrast to the 32 segments formed during leech embryogenesis and to the numerous segments formed in the other non-leech clitellates (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Anderson, 1973a</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Balavoine, 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">Goto et al., 1999b</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib92">Weisblat and Shankland, 1985</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib95">Zackson, 1982</xref>). Nevertheless, as in clitellates, pairs of mesodermal precursors (called primary blast cells (PBCs)) are sequentially produced in an anterior to posterior progression, and correspond to a mesodermal segment of the larva. The segregation of the series of segmental PBCs in <italic>P. dumerilii</italic> (from 5ml/r to 8ml/r) is preceded by two pairs of precursors (3ml/r and 4ml/r) that divided only a few times during our analysis and probably contribute to the head mesoderm. These two pairs of anterior head mesoderm precursors may be related to the six pairs of em precursors known in the leech that contribute to endoderm and pharynx musculature (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8">Figure 8C</xref>) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Gline et al., 2011</xref>).</p><p>We were not able to determine the precise tissue-type contribution of each mesodermal PBC because our lineage analysis ends at the beginning of late trochophore stage, before cell differentiation takes place. Additional imaging that extends further in development suggests that segmental blocks of mesodermal cells contributed mostly to a single hemisegment (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s3">Figure 4—figure supplement 3</xref>, <xref ref-type="video" rid="fig4video17">Figure 4—video 17</xref>). However, we cannot exclude the possibility that each clonal block will eventually contribute complementary sets of different tissue types to two or more contiguous segments in the juveniles, as they do in the leech. Future studies will also determine whether these precursors give rise to a few neuronal cells (as in the clitellates), as well as other tissues such as the gut endoderm, and possibly pygidium (the non-segmental posterior end) as it has been previously suggested (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib81">Starunov et al., 2015</xref>).</p><p>Another important difference between <italic>P. dumerilii</italic> and clitellate annelids resides in the size of the mesodermal teloblasts and their evolution through embryogenesis. In the leech and other clitellates, M teloblasts are huge cells that undergo a long series of very asymmetric divisions, budding off a series of much smaller mesodermal PBCs, before they become ‘exhausted’ in terms of cytoplasmic volume after they produce the most posterior segments (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib77">Shimizu, 1982</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib91">Weisblat and Kuo, 2014</xref>). In <italic>P. dumerilii</italic>, correlating with the small number of segments produced during embryogenesis, M teloblasts are born with a medium size and appear to get quickly ‘exhausted’ through a short series of asymmetric divisions (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6</xref>). It will be interesting to find out in the future, whether such M teloblasts exists in non-clitellate annelids that form more segments during the embryonic/larval stage, such as <italic>Capitella</italic> which forms 13 larval segments (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Balavoine, 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib74">Seaver, 2016</xref>), and whether teloblast size evolved in proportion to the number of larval segments (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig9">Figure 9</xref>, also see discussion below).</p><fig id="fig9" position="float"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.30463.049</object-id><label>Figure 9.</label><caption><title>Phylogenetic distribution of embryonic and post-embryonic teloblasts in some annelids, and the relation to the number of segments made.</title><p>A simplified annelid phylogeny (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib90">Weigert and Bleidorn, 2016</xref>) summarizes the main annelid species investigated for segment formation and teloblasts.

In leeches, a fixed number of segments is made during direct embryonic development and none added after hatching. In non-leech clitellates (such as <italic>Tubifex</italic>), the embryos make a few tens of segments during embryogenesis and add many more after hatching. In non-clitellate annelids (Errantia, Sedentaria, and early branching), the number of larval segments is variable, and many more are added in post-larval development: In Nereidids (Errantia) such as <italic>Platynereis</italic>, only three larval segments develop, while in <italic>Capitella</italic> (Sedentaria), 13 larval segments (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib88">Thamm and Seaver, 2008</xref>) and in <italic>Chaetopterus</italic> (an early-branching annelid) 15 larval segments develop (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib72">Seaver et al., 2001</xref>).

Studies using bright-field microscopy, and DiI injections suggested that the mesodermal SAZ originates from the 4d blastomeres (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Ackermann et al., 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Anderson, 1973b</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib65">Rebscher et al., 2007</xref>), but which cells within the 4d lineage make up the growth zone has not been identified to date. Our work successfully identifies 8ML/MR as the origin of the mesodermal SAZ in the larva. A slowly cycling small cluster of cells are made by 8ML/MR, located immediately anterior to the pPGCs, consistent with the previous studies that described this region as the Vasa(+) ‘mesodermal posterior growth zone’ (MPGZ) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib64">Rebscher et al., 2012</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib65">Rebscher et al., 2007</xref>). Our imaging dataset is only until mid-/late-trochophore stage, thus we do not know whether all or a subset of these cells will produce the mesodermal SAZ in the later larval stages and juveniles. Thus, how these precursors go onto form the ring-like mesodermal SAZ and how they contribute to new tissues in juvenile worms remain to be determined.</p><p>This study in <italic>P. dumerilii</italic> helps putting different types of development in the annelids into a phylogenetic perspective (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig9">Figure 9</xref>). In the leeches, the totality of a species-specific number of segments are made during embryogenesis through the activity of large embryonic teloblasts. In contrast, in most marine annelids, the majority of segments are made during post-embryonic juvenile development, through the activity of inconspicuous posterior stem cells whose characteristics are still largely unknown. Earlier works in <italic>P. dumerilii</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">de Rosa et al., 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Gazave et al., 2013</xref>) have suggested that posterior stem cells in the juvenile may have a teloblast-like activity. We establish in this article that the mesodermal teloblasts which are very similar to the leech are indeed at play in the <italic>P. dumerilii</italic> embryo, contributing to the formation of the three larval segments. We also show that these embryonic teloblasts are most likely at the origin of the teloblast-like posterior stem cells of the juvenile (post-embryonic teloblasts), thus possibly establishing a cellular continuity in segment formation in <italic>P. dumerilii</italic>. In addition, it will be useful to determine if embryonic ectodermal teloblasts exist in <italic>P. dumerilii</italic> and whether they are at the origin of the ectodermal posterior stem cells as well. It is very likely that the ancestral life cycle in annelids involved these two phases of segment formation (embryonic/larval and post-embryonic) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig9">Figure 9</xref>). The large teloblasts of Clitellate embryos would have evolved in the context of an acceleration of development, most or all segment formation happening in the embryonic stage (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Balavoine, 2014</xref>). Meanwhile, parallels among all spiralians remain to be determined. It is legitimate to wonder whether embryonic teloblasts are present in mollusks having a form of mesodermal segmentation such as chitons or aplacophorans (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib70">Scherholz et al., 2015</xref>), or whether post-embryonic teloblasts are present in other posteriorly growing phyla, such as nemerteans. Future studies using high-resolution live imaging and genetic lineage-tracing methods on these exciting but understudied spiralian groups, as well as additional studies in the annelids will help answer the open questions surrounding teloblasts and their involvement in the evolution of different body plans.</p></sec></sec><sec id="s4" sec-type="materials|methods"><title>Materials and methods</title><table-wrap id="keyresource" position="anchor"><label>Key resources table</label><table frame="hsides" rules="groups"><thead><tr><th>Reagent type (species) <break/>or resource</th><th>Designation</th><th>Source or reference</th><th>Identifiers</th><th>Additional information</th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td>Gene (<italic>Platynereis dumerilii</italic>)</td><td>Pdu-cdt1</td><td>NA</td><td>GenBank No: MF614951</td><td>From the full 2337 bp coding sequence, a 1946 bp part including the start site, and ending before the stop codon was amplified</td></tr><tr><td>Strain, strain background (<italic>P. dumerilii</italic>)</td><td>Wild Type</td><td>Institut Jacques Monod cultures</td><td/><td/></tr><tr><td>Recombinant DNA reagent</td><td>pCS2+ mVenus-cdt1(aa1-147)</td><td>this paper</td><td>GenBank No: MF614950</td><td/></tr><tr><td>Recombinant DNA reagent</td><td>pEXPTol2-H2A-mCherry</td><td>Other</td><td/><td>Plasmid was not specifically produced for this paper, and has been published before.

As a result, samples were healthy after mounting during extended periods of imaging, and even after imaging they continued to grow in the agarose. Mounting was carried out on a warm plate to keep low-melting agarose from solidifying while allowing enough time for rotating the samples to the desired position using an eyelash tool (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig10s1">Figure 10—figure supplement 1</xref>). Low melting agarose (Invitrogen, France, 16520050) was prepared as 1% solution in filtered natural sea water by microwaving, and 500 µl aliquots were kept in −20˚C until use. These tubes were thawed in a water bath at 65˚C right before mounting, and kept in dry heating block at 37˚C once thawed.</p><p>Injected embryos and larvae can be checked for normal development based on a number of criteria observed at different stages of development. For injected embryos to be imaged early (around 7–8 hpf at 18°C developmental time), we identified those injected samples without any visible deformations, clear animal-vegetal polarization, and four oil droplets with typical appearance at this stage (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Fischer et al., 2010</xref>). For samples to be imaged after ciliary band development (15 hpf or later, at 18°C developmental time), we looked for normal ciliary bands, normal swimming behavior, chaetal sacs with developing bristles, and larval eyes. We picked healthy samples based on these criteria, as well as the samples with optimal fluorescence signal strength (which varies based on the amount of mRNA injected), and appropriate angle for mesoderm imaging after mounting.</p><p>Depending on the developmental stage to be imaged, samples had to be mounted before or after the ciliary band formation and the start of swimming movements. Mounting embryos or larvae with functional cilia will result in the specimens rotating in their agarose spherical lodge. For stages after the cilia form, immobilization requires deciliation at the time of mounting. We thus carried out imaging for both pre-hatching (embryonic and pre-larval) and post-hatching (larval) stages using two different techniques:</p><sec id="s4-6-1"><title>Mounting technique 1 - Mounting before ciliary band formation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig10">Figure 10B</xref>)</title><p>Cilia do not appear before 15 hpf (18°C).

Embryos and larvae can then be mounted in low-melting agarose in the next ten minutes before the cilia start to grow back. These DMSO-treated larvae recover completely and grow without abnormalities. Mounting injected samples during larval stages may be desirable when a specific and precise orientation of the sample is required starting at a specific stage.</p></sec></sec><sec id="s4-7"><title>EdU cell proliferation analysis and immunohistochemistry</title><sec id="s4-7-1"><title>EdU assay on injected samples</title><p>Embryos were injected at one-, two-, or four-cell stage with <italic>HistoneH2A-mCherry</italic> and <italic>mVenus-cdt1(aa1-147)</italic> solution mix, and were raised until 12 hpf.

Concretely, the script extracts the intersection of the 3D stacks and a series of near spherical surfaces located at increasing depth from the tissue surface. The intersections are then 2D projected as if successive ‘onion layers’ of the sample were flattened. The stack (x; y; z) is replaced by a (x; y; ol) stack where ‘ol’ represent onion layers of increasing depth.

The experimental focus is on the 4d lineage, which was previously shown to give rise to mesodermal segments and primordial germ cells but the underlying cellular mechanisms were unknown. Leveraging these technological advances to extend imaging and 4d lineage tracing the authors demonstrate early segregation of PGCs in that linage, following by their clustering and cell cycle quiescence. Moreover, the traced cells divide to form several segment rudiments, not as many as in leeches but using a similar teloblast asymmetric division mechanism. This is a novel observation, along with the extension of the lineage analysis by up to 8 cell generations. In addition, the authors report identification of the embryonic origins of mesodermal posterior growth zone and report different cell cycling properties for differentially-fated progenies. The importance of this work lies in that provides high resolution in vivo analyses of early development that extend earlier studies. The methods will be valuable for future studies of this and other marine species. Moreover, this work reveals a lineage separation that is similar to the well-studied teloblasts, like leaches. This is, evolutionarily, a surprising result, since it was thought that leeches were highly derived. Conversely, this work implies that leeches simply took a common feature of segmentation that is found throughout the phylum and amplified it.</p><p>Essential revisions:</p><p>1) The time interval in time-lapse analyses of several minutes is relatively long questioning the lineage relationships established by Imaris. Therefore, a manual validation of critical lineages to corroborate automatic analysis is essential.</p><p>2) Pdu FUCCI system to be better characterized, and its utility for this study better justified. Why Pdu FUCCI system is also labelling G2? Currently, it is not clear whether it provides additional information over the live imaging and tracing.</p><p>3) The paper needs to be presented better in terms of figure numbering, labeling and how figures are incorporated in the logical flow of the manuscript. Moreover, whereas the lineage tracing is the most important aspect of this work it is presented as an add on. Finally, the authors appropriately acknowledge that even their extended lineage tracing does not allow them to trace the lineages until the morphologic segments are apparent. It would be important to more clearly present the argument that the linear arrangements of specific sub-lineages represent segmental anlagen.</p><p>4) Videos 4.1 and 4.2 could not be converted.

In brief, the current cycling pattern obtained actually matches the endogenous patterns reported in other organisms, thus it is not surprising that the late G2 phase is labeled. In addition, for the purposes of the work in this manuscript, the cycling pattern observed was sufficiently useful. However, we are currently working on developing additional live-cell cycle reporters that will more precisely match different phases of the cell cycle. While we believe this ongoing work is out of the scope of this manuscript, it is worth noting that as a part of these efforts we have tested several different constructs obtained from the authors of the original FUCCI systems based on zebrafish and human sequences (Sakaue-Sawano et al., 2008) and did not observe fluorescence.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Currently, it is not clear whether it provides additional information over the live imaging and tracing.</p></disp-quote><p>Pdu-FUCCI was indeed crucial for cell lineage analysis carried out in this manuscript, as it provided additional resolution into cell cycle, making it feasible to trace lineages manually under the time and image resolution constraints we had. To clarify this, we added a section at the beginning of Results.</p><p>To our knowledge, with current algorithms available via different cell lineage-tracing platforms (such as Imaris, or the Fiji plugin Mamut), it is not possible to carry out an automated lineage analysis for embryos like <italic>P. dumerilii</italic>’s which have significantly variable cell sizes and nuclei. Most tracing algorithms rely on more or less uniform nuclei size for confidently tracking them from a time point to the next, such as it has been done in the early <italic>C. elegans</italic> and <italic>Drosophila</italic> embryos (Tomer et al., 2012; Wu et al., 2011). Consequently, lineage tracing cell in embryos such as <italic>P. dumerilii</italic>’s still rely on manual curation, especially at stages of development we have attempted in this work. During this manual curation of lineages, the researcher has to mark the nuclei one by one, from one frame to the next. We have optimized the imaging conditions for healthy-developing embryos, and in doing so, we had to give up better time- and image- resolution (therefore decreasing the time embryos were exposed to laser light for imaging). As a result, each frame had to be carefully examined to make sure to pick the right nuclei as the daughters of a dividing cell. The cell cycle reporter was critical at this stage, as it enabled observation of a particular cell’s progression in cell cycle, therefore making it easier to differentiate it from the surrounding cells, and predict if it is likely to divide. For example, if a nucleus being traced was red (meaning it is in early G2 phase) and it became orange/yellow (the brief period in late G2 when cells upregulate the cell cycle construct right before division), it was possible to predict the cell will divide soon (possibly in the next frame). This layer of extra information was crucial in accurate manual curation of lineages, especially as the cells progressively became smaller, division after division.</p><p>Of note, for this study, we did not have access to SPIM (i.e. light sheet microscopy), which would have allowed higher time resolution without deleterious effects. We used the cell cycle reporter to complement live imaging conditions with the technology available to us. We believe that our work may encourage others who have access to only confocal imaging. As data processing, visualization, and analysis remain a challenge in light sheet (Girstmair et al., 2016; Shah et al., 2017) scanning confocal imaging continues to be useful for live-imaging and lineage-tracing at single cell level, with the right combination of techniques.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>3) The paper needs to be presented better in terms of figure numbering, labeling and how figures are incorporated in the logical flow of the manuscript. Moreover, whereas the lineage tracing is the most important aspect of this work it is presented as an add on.</p></disp-quote><p>To emphasize cell lineage analysis we put <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2</xref> as a figure supplement to <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1</xref> (new numbering: <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s2">Figure 1—figure supplement 2</xref>) and removed the section from the main text. We also shortened some of the cell cycle discussion and instead of having this as the final discussion of the manuscript, we placed this part earlier in the Discussion (subsection “Cell cycle patterns of the 4d lineage”).</p><p>To emphasize the importance of the lineage analysis in a larger evo-devo picture, we have added an additional summary figure (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig9">Figure 9</xref>) that shows phylogenetic distribution of our current knowledge on teloblasts across annelids (and spiralians), and we conclude the manuscript with a discussion of these concepts (subsection “Formation of segmental and growth zone mesoderm in <italic>P. dumerilii</italic>”, last paragraph).</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Finally, the authors appropriately acknowledge that even their extended lineage tracing does not allow them to trace the lineages until the morphologic segments are apparent. It would be important to more clearly present the argument that the linear arrangements of specific sub-lineages represent segmental anlagen.</p></disp-quote><p>To address this point we have made several additions to the manuscript (subsection “Each mesodermal hemisegment is the progeny of individual blast cells produced in successive divisions”, fourth paragraph):</p><p>1) We have added a figure supplement showing how the distinct mesodermal clonal cell clusters (i.e. one sub-lineage) align with the chaetal sacs of the corresponding hemisegment (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s2">Figure 3—figure supplement 2</xref>). This supplementary figure also demonstrates the position of the mesodermal clusters in relation to chaetal sacs more clearly.</p><p>2) To demonstrate how these early mesodermal clusters eventually encase the chaetal sacs in each hemisegment, and the cells mainly stay in their designated segmental anlage, we added a new time-lapse video and a corresponding figure (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s3">Figure 4—figure supplement 3</xref>, Video 8).</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>4) Videos 4.1 and 4.2 could not be converted. Videos 5.3 and 5.4 are missing.</p></disp-quote><p>5.3 and 5.4 do not exist, thus we removed these from the text.
