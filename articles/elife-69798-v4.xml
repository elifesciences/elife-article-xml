Many of the antimicrobials that we rely on to treat and/or control infections caused by common bacterial pathogens have lost or are rapidly losing their efficacy. This situation has become typical for a host of diseases and pathogens but is arguably epitomised by enteric (diarrhoeal) infections that arise in low and middle-income countries (LMICs). Annually, diarrhoea accounts for approximately 1.3 million deaths globally, with the preponderance of these occurring in young children residing in LMICs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Kotloff, 2017</xref>). Due to a lack of other scalable approaches, antimicrobials are a key tool in limiting the impact of these infections, but the trajectory of AMR describes an escalating problem, especially in vulnerable populations.</p><p>Diarrhoeal diseases are notoriously complex, as a wide range of pathogens can trigger the syndrome; but of all potential aetiological agents, bacteria belonging to genus <italic>Shigella</italic> pose the greatest AMR threat. Recent estimates suggest that <italic>Shigella</italic> are associated with ~125 million diarrhoeal episodes and 200,000 deaths annually (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Khalil et al., 2018</xref>). Additionally, <italic>Shigella</italic> along with enterotoxigenic <italic>Escherichia coli</italic> (ETEC), were the most predominant bacterial pathogens in the stools of paediatric diarrhoeal patients in South Asia and sub-Saharan Africa (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Kotloff et al., 2013</xref>). This study also found that <italic>Shigella</italic> were the most prevalent pathogen in diarrhoeal children aged 2–5 years; a reanalysis of stool samples from this study using more sensitive molecular approaches suggested that burden of <italic>Shigella</italic> may actual be double that of previous estimates (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Liu et al., 2016</xref>).</p><p>Clinical evidence strongly supports the use of antimicrobials to treat severe <italic>Shigella</italic> associated diarrhoea (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Kotloff et al., 2018</xref>). Appropriate antimicrobial therapy reduces the duration of fever and diarrhoea associated with <italic>Shigella</italic> by 1–2 days, which in turn limits the severity of symptoms and the risk of further complications (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib46">Vinh et al., 2000</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Christopher et al., 2010</xref>). Additionally, the shedding of the pathogen in the stools is restricted by antimicrobials, which then reduce onward transmission. As there is currently no licenced vaccine for <italic>Shigella,</italic> antimicrobials are one of the only reliable mechanisms available for disease control (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">Levine et al., 2007</xref>). However, <italic>Shigella</italic> are highly adept at acquiring multi-drug resistance (MDR) plasmids from other member of the Enterobacteriaceae and resistance mutations are commonly associated with ‘successful’ lineages (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Baker et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Chung The et al., 2019</xref>). Consequently, there has been an ‘arms race’ between the pathogen and antimicrobials, with the WHO ultimately recommending ciprofloxacin, azithromycin, pivmecillinam, and ceftriaxone as the empirical drug choices for <italic>Shigella</italic> infections (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib48">Williams and Berkley, 2018</xref>). Inevitably, resistance to these antimicrobials has emerged and increasingly resistant organisms, such as extensively drug resistant (XDR) <italic>Shigella sonnei</italic> in Vietnam (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib42">Thanh Duy et al., 2020</xref>), are spreading across LMICs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Chung The et al., 2019</xref>), in travellers returning from LMICs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Baker et al., 2016</xref>), and in men-who-have-sex-with-men (MSM) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Baker et al., 2015</xref>). Accordingly, the US-CDC has declared AMR <italic>Shigella</italic> a serious global health threat requiring new interventions and the WHO has placed them on the global priority list of antibiotic-resistant bacteria to guide research, discovery, and development of new antibiotics (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib43">The World Health Organisation, 2007</xref>).</p><p>After the genomics revolution of the 1990s, the research community embarked on a series of target-based drug discovery programmes to identify novel antimicrobial compounds. This strategy, because of lack of translation from target-activity to whole-cell activity, produced largely disappointing results (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Gwynn et al., 2010</xref>). Conversely, phenotypic antimicrobial screens have proven to yield a higher hit rate than target-based approaches with several successful examples in infectious diseases (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Gamo et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Ballell et al., 2013</xref>). Aiming to identify compounds with activity against MDR <italic>Shigella</italic>, we established an academic-industrial collaboration (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Ballell et al., 2016</xref>), creating a platform to perform in vitro phenotypic screening of ~1.7 million compounds against antimicrobial susceptible and MDR <italic>Shigella</italic>. We interrogated a collection of compounds spanning broad chemical diversity, comprised of a combination of naive chemistry, compounds originating from previous antibacterial drug discovery programs, and currently marketed antimicrobials. Using this approach, we identified several lead chemical classes with previously reported antimicrobial activity, opting to further characterise Tebipenem (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib50">Yao et al., 2016</xref>), an oral carbapenem, that could be rapidly accelerated into clinical testing to treat infections caused by MDR <italic>Shigella</italic> and other gastrointestinal pathogens.</p></sec><sec id="s2" sec-type="materials|methods"><title>Materials and methods</title><sec id="s2-1"><title>High-throughput screening of compound collections</title><p>We developed a high-throughput screening (HTS) method to identify compounds that could inhibit the growth of <italic>Shigella flexneri</italic> 2457T in Müller Hinton medium (Sigma Aldrich, UK). We adapted a resazurin reduction protocol from Franzblau et al. as surrogate readout for bacterial viability because it provided a stable signal, a low interference level, and was cost effective (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Franzblau et al., 1998</xref>). Prior to the day of experimentation, one colony was used to inoculate 50 mL Mueller Hinton medium, and the culture was incubated overnight at 37 °C. The next day, 500 μL of the bacterial culture were inoculated into 50 mL fresh Mueller Hinton medium and bacterial growth was measured periodically at 600 nm. When the culture reached OD = 0.4–0.6, the inoculum was diluted to 1 × 10<sup>6</sup> CFU/mL; this bacterial suspension was added to compound pre-dispensed plates for screening.</p><p>The assay was performed in 1536-well polystyrene assay plates (HiBase, μClear, Greiner Bio‐One) and used to screen ~1.7 million compounds from (a) GSK naïve chemical diversity, (b) GSK antibacterial programs, and (c) marketed antimicrobial agents. All commercially available chemicals were purchased from either Sigma Aldrich, UK, AK Scientific, or Fischer Chemicals. The GSK compound screening set was sub-selected from the 8 million compound GSK collection using the principles described by Harper and co-workers (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Harper et al., 2004</xref>). The process to generate the structural filters to remove compounds bearing undesirable/reactive chemotypes and/or non-developable physicochemical properties has been described previously by <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Chakravorty et al., 2018</xref>. The set of 4000 compounds with known antibacterial pedigree from the GSK antibacterial programs was selected from GSK compound collection using an MIC &lt;1 µM against <italic>E. coli</italic> as cut-off value for selection. The set of marketed antibacterial agents included most commercial antimicrobial agents.</p><p>For screening, plates were prepared by dispensing 50 nl of compound from master plates at 1 mM in each well using a LabCyte Echo system. The final assay volume was 5 μl and the final compound concentration was 10 µM. The 11th and 12th columns were growth controls containing 50 nL of DMSO. The 34th and 35th columns contained 50 nL of Moxifloxacin at 20 μM as negative growth controls. Five µl of bacterial inoculum was dispensed into compound pre-dispensed plates using a Multidrop Combi dispenser (Thermo Scientific). Plates were agitated for 10 s to ensure mixing and incubated at 37 °C overnight (16–17 hr). Following overnight culture, 2 µl resazurin solution (Resazurin tablets for milk testing, BDH) was added to each well and incubated at room temperature in the dark for 3 hr. Fluorescence intensity was measured using an Envision plate reader (PerkinElmer). For IC50 and IC90 determination, data were normalised by using DMSO as positive control (100% bacterial growth) and 20 μM moxifloxacin as negative control (0% bacterial growth). Data were analysed using Base software and statistical cut-off analysis was used for ‘hit’ selection following a standard GSK protocol. To calculate the statistical cut-off, percentage growth inhibition was calculated per well according to the plate controls, these values were aggregated to calculate the robust mean and standard deviation (SD) of the distribution.

Firstly, a 10,000-compound validation set was used to fine tune Z´and S/B ratio values in HTS conditions. The 0.65% hit rate obtained in this test was aligned with the rate expected for whole cell screenings. Secondly, we used a 1000-compound nuisance set containing compounds selected for their high Inhibition frequency index (IFI; defined as the % of HTS campaigns in which a compound has shown &gt;50% inhibition at 10 μM) to identify assays with high susceptibility to nuisance mechanisms, which can lead to identification of a high rate of false positive compounds. We obtained a hit rate of 0.39 with this set, corresponding to a low false positive rate. Lastly, an antibacterial tool compound set contained an ad hoc set of marketed antimicrobials with different modes of action. This set was evaluated using the two prioritised readout systems (resazurin and XTT) and was used to mitigate the risk of biasing the hit identification by the mechanism of action as both readouts displayed similar IC<sub>50</sub> values in all compound families.</p></sec><sec id="s2-2"><title>Antimicrobial susceptibility testing and time kill curves performed in clinical isolates</title><p>Selected compounds, including Tebipenem, were profiled against a panel of 338 clinical isolates of enteric pathogens comprised of <italic>Shigella</italic> (Vietnam and Kenya; n = 135), non-typhoidal <italic>Salmonella</italic> (Vietnam; n = 117), <italic>Campylobacter</italic> (Vietnam; n = 75), and various pathogenic <italic>E. coli</italic> species (Vietnam; n = 7) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Butcher et al., 2014</xref>).

We quantified the concentration of Tebipenem and Tebipenem pivoxil by LC-MS at 15, 30, 60, and 240 min after oral administration of 50 mg/kg Tebipenem pivoxil in the different sections of the intestinal tract (the prodrug hydrolyses ex vivo; therefore, it was not possible to differentiate between pivoxil and free base). We observed high concentrations ( &gt; 300 µg/g tissue) of Tebipenem in the duodenum and jejunum 15 min after administration, which declined to &gt;400 ng/g tissue after 240 min (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4C</xref>).

At the same early time point, Tebipenem free base could be detected both in the lumen and associated with enterocytes in the jejunum and the ileum.

At the later time point (60 min), Tebipenem free base could be detected in the lumen and enterocytes throughout the gut, whereas Tebipenem pivoxil was not detectable in the lumen (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4E</xref>). These data, in combination the oral pharmacokinetics data, showing Tebipenem pivoxil has 50% (%<italic>F</italic> = 52 ± 1, <xref ref-type="table" rid="table2">Table 2</xref>) bioavailability, suggest that ~50% of Tebipenem pivoxil is hydrolysed in the intestinal lumen, where the free drug may inhibit growth of bacteria present in the lumen. Additionally, 50% of the dosed Tebipenem pivoxil can penetrate the enterocytes lining the gut surface and is immediately hydrolysed (Tebipenem pivoxil pro-drug was not detected within enterocytes by MALDI-TOF), making the drug ideal for the treatment of invasive gut bacteria. Overall, MALDI imaging after 60 min indicated lower concentrations of Tebipenem free base in the lumen of jejunum, ileum, caecum, and colon, which was compatible with observations from the quantitative LC-MS analysis (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4E</xref>).</p><p>To determine if an increased systemic concentration of active drug by orally dosing the pivoxil prodrug resulted in superior performance, we compared the efficacy of Tebipenem pivoxil and Tebipenem free base in a mouse model of shigellosis.

Here, we exploited a broad phenotypic screening strategy to identify compounds that may have utility against highly antimicrobial resistant enteric pathogens, specifically MDR/XDR <italic>Shigella</italic>. Ultimately, we identified and progressed Tebipenem pivoxil (a licenced oral carbapenem) to pre-clinical testing for <italic>Shigella</italic> infections. Tebipenem pivoxil has many suitable characteristics for the treatment of infections caused by MDR and XDR Gram-negative bacteria; it is broad spectrum, it is rapidly bactericidal, it is already used in paediatric clinical practice (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Kataoka et al., 2016</xref>), and it can be administered orally (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Arends et al., 2019</xref>), making it highly suited for the treatment of gastrointestinal infections in the community. Despite these positives, there are potential issues surrounding the widespread use of this drug, most notably the potential to generate resistance against carbapenems, a very important last resort class of antibacterial compounds.</p><p>We initiated the project by screening a large compound library against a single <italic>Shigella</italic> isolate grown extracellularly. Notably, none of the chemicals meeting the desired criteria (inhibition of bacterial growth with a physicochemical and safety profile suitable for downstream developability) represented novel chemical classes. All hits were already known to possess antibacterial properties and belonged to either the GSK antibacterial subset or were already commercially available. The fact that no new modes of action were identified after screening 1.7 million compounds via extracellular in vitro screening is concerning, suggesting we may be close to exhausting the chemical space for antibacterial agents that can be identified by traditional antibacterial screening assays. However, innovative phenotypic assays, which interrogate other stages of the bacterial infection lifecycle, such as intracellular activity or invasion blockade, may offer new opportunities for developing new chemical diversity, novel modes of action and possibly narrower spectrum drugs. Using the selected approach, we opted to focus on a defined set of compounds with known antibacterial activity against <italic>E. coli</italic>, allowing us to identify two main chemical classes that additionally exhibited activity against clinical <italic>Shigella</italic> isolates. Specifically, we found that carbapenems had high potency against both laboratory <italic>Shigella</italic> strains and clinical isolates of MDR <italic>Shigella</italic> from highly endemic LMICs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib42">Thanh Duy et al., 2020</xref>). Consequently, Tebipenem was selected as a lead candidate for further pre-clinical characterisation due to the great potency and the availability of a prodrug which allows oral administration.</p><p>Tebipenem had enhanced activity (with respect to ciprofloxacin) against a panel of 81 <italic>Shigella</italic> clinical isolates from Southeast Asia, an observation in line with the high prevalence of ciprofloxacin resistance in many <italic>Shigella sonnei</italic> and a high proportion of Gram-negative bacterial pathogens across Southeast Asia (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Chung The et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">Pham Thanh et al., 2016</xref>). Tebipenem additionally exhibited high level of potency against a broad panel of &gt;300 clinically relevant MDR enteric pathogens. These data outline the potential use of this antimicrobial for the treatment of enteric infections of suspected bacterial origin without the necessity of an accompanying diagnostic test, which remains the most common clinical practice in many LMICs. It is noteworthy that carbapenem resistance is emerging in some Gram-negative organisms in Asia and has spread to other regions (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib51">Yao et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib49">Wyres et al., 2020</xref>). This phenomenon is partly associated with the spread of the NDM-1 gene, which encodes a beta-metalloprotease (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Grundmann et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib52">Yong et al., 2009</xref>). Carbapenem resistance has not yet been reported in any <italic>Shigella</italic> species and is not currently common in other Gram-negative bacteria causing diarrhoea. However, given the propensity of <italic>Shigella</italic> to develop resistance to commonly used antimicrobials through the acquisition of AMR plasmids and individual gene cassettes, we additionally would need to consider the requirement of a companion diagnostic to avoid treatment failures or overemployment of the drug, which may trigger resistance. Further, we need a broader discussion on the operational and ethics of using oral carbapenems and their access. If this is a route that is to be followed we clearly need patient efficacy data, antimicrobial clearance data, projection modelling, and detailed insights into collateral effects, including the selection and generation of carbapenem resistant organisms. We see the need for some legislation for the use of Tebipenem in this context, but also recognise that we have limited alternatives as we have depleted the pool of efficacious antimicrobials.</p><p>We considered that the Tebipenem (and other carbapenems) may be synergistic with drugs with alternative other modes of action, including existing standard of care antimicrobials (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib48">Williams and Berkley, 2018</xref>). Antibacterial combinations are an understudied area, and we did not aim measure the likelihood of emergence of resistance to either compound, just to identify potential synergy/inhibition. These preliminary experimental data suggested that Azithromycin, which reduced the MIC for <italic>Shigella</italic> isolates for Tebipenem when tested in in vitro combination, may offer an encouraging primary combination option, given the common use of azithromycin for the treatment of severe diarrhoea (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Gharpure et al., 2022</xref>). Additionally, a second potential combination showing in vitro synergy was identified with an LpxC inhibitor (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib41">Surivet et al., 2020</xref>), which again showed good activity when tested against the majority of enteric bacteria studied. Again, this observation is encouraging and adds further support to LpxC development programs; however, there is a clear need to better study antibacterial combinations and not only to study synergy but also if they do have an impact on stimulating resistance to newer classes of antimicrobials (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib53">Zhu et al., 2021</xref>). Our data highlight the utility of Tebipenem for treating a spectrum of enteric pathogens and the potential benefit of co-administration with recommended antimicrobials suggest that combination therapy with Tebipenem is clearly worth exploring through clinical trials and/or through controlled human infection studies with <italic>Shigella</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">MacLennan et al., 2019</xref>). The existing safety profile of tebipenem and other standard-of-care antimicrobial opens the possibility of direct progression to a clinical proof of concept study as soon as possible (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Kataoka et al., 2016</xref>).</p><p>Encouragingly, Tebipenem pivoxil is approved and marketed in Japan as Orapenem (Meiji Seika) for the treatment of adult and paediatric respiratory tract infections (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Kataoka et al., 2016</xref>). In addition, Spero Therapeutics are working on a novel formulation with extended half-life for administration in adults which is under clinical evaluation for recurrent urinary tract infections (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Arends et al., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Eckburg et al., 2019</xref>). Notably, the MICs of the panel of enteric bacteria against Tebipenem tested here were substantially lower than the clinical breakpoints reported for efficacious treatment of respiratory tract infections. <italic>Shigella</italic> infections have a pathophysiology which is obviously distinct to that of respiratory tract infections, but our MALDI-TOF data suggests that Tebipenem reaches a high concentration in the enterocytes lining the gastrointestinal surface. Our data suggest that the currently approved dose of Orapenem will reach higher local concentrations in the <italic>Shigella</italic> infection-relevant cells in the gut than in the respiratory tract. Therefore, the drug distribution behaviour of Orapenem appears to be especially convenient for the treatment of enteric infections, as the active component is specifically released at the site of infection. The release of free Tebipenem intracellularly would clear intracellular bacteria (vital for <italic>Shigella</italic> and <italic>Salmonella</italic>) and active Tebipenem in the intestinal lumen would reduce extracellular bacteria and limit cellular invasion. Our data from two distinct animal models implies this process is occurring, as the drug was highly potent after <italic>Shigella</italic> challenge and able to clear the gut of infecting organisms with 24 hr of administration in gnotobiotic piglets.</p><p>In conclusion, we performed a screening study with the specific aim of identifying novel compounds with antibacterial activity against MDR/XDR <italic>Shigella</italic>. Overall, the results were disappointing and raise wider questions about the potential for the discovery of new antibacterial classes. However, we did identify multiple new avenues for using existing compounds; specifically, Tebipenem had excellent in vitro profile against MDR/XDR <italic>Shigella</italic> and other Gram-negative bacteria (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">Mylona et al., 2021</xref>). We could show that the oral bioavailability of and pharmacokinetics of Tebipenem pivoxil makes it ideal for the treatment of gastrointestinal infections. Experimentation in animal models of shigellosis found the drug to be highly efficacious with comparable activity to ciprofloxacin when animals were challenged with ciprofloxacin susceptible <italic>Shigella</italic> isolates.</p><p>We are in desperate need of alternative antimicrobials for infections caused by MDR/XDR bacteria and our data outline the oral carbapenem Tebipenem as an ideal repurposing candidate. The testing and controlled introduction of Tebipenem pivoxil combinations for MDR <italic>Shigella</italic> infections may slow the rate of spread of organisms that exhibit resistance to current standard of care antimicrobials or provide an extended window of opportunity for the further development and introduction of <italic>Shigella</italic> vaccines and the next generation of therapeutic approaches.</p></sec></body><back><sec id="s5" sec-type="additional-information"><title>Additional information</title><fn-group content-type="competing-interest"><title>Competing interests</title><fn fn-type="COI-statement" id="conf1"><p>is affiliated with GSK Global Health.

Your article has been reviewed by 2 peer reviewers, and the evaluation has been overseen by a Reviewing Editor and Wendy Garrett as the Senior Editor. The following individual involved in review of your submission has agreed to reveal their identity: Luke McNally (Reviewer #2).</p><p>The reviewers have discussed their reviews with one another, and the Reviewing Editor has drafted this to help you prepare a revised submission.</p><p>Essential revisions:</p><p>While the work is valuable and of broad interest, in its present form it is difficult to fully assess its impact and the validity of the claims. In particular, the authors should include information on sample sizes and statistical analyses, which are essential to support the findings. Additional information should also be included regarding the relevance of acquiring resistance to tebipenem and /or combination therapy.</p><p>1) Overall, the presentation of methods and results are incomplete and hard to follow, making it hard to judge the rigor and robustness of the underlying science. Specifically, important information about replication and statistical analysis are missing for many experiments and there are multiple cases where results and conclusions are discussed without any data being shown. This limits the utility and impact of the paper as it would be impossible for any of the experiments as presented to be used in meta-analyses. Some examples are listed below:</p><p>– For all figure panels summary statistics and results of statistical tests should be reported.

Also, the scales in the images are impossible to read and the general phenomenon being observed is poorly described in the text.

The authors suggest that, due to its broad-spectrum activity against clinical isolates of multiple MDR enteric pathogens, tebipenem pivoxil could be used as a first-line therapy without diagnostic/drug-susceptibility profiling. I agree that this is appealing in resources-poor settings, but could lead to rampant overuse and drive rapid emergence of resistance. Carbapenems are typically reserved for otherwise intractable infections, and so increased selection for carbapenem-resistant enteric pathogens and increased circulation of mobile element-encoded carbapenemases could impact treatment of diverse MDR pathogens and pose a serious public health threat. To combat resistance, the authors suggest use of combination therapy. However, they discuss azithromycin as one of the most promising candidates for combination therapy, despite its apparent antagonistic interaction with tebipenem against <italic>E. coli</italic>. This suggests that combination therapy should only be used after diagnostic testing, limiting the clinical utility of this approach in many settings. My conclusion is that tebipenem pivoxil could be a valuable tool in certain circumstances, but it is unclear how to responsibly use it at scale, which limits the potential impact on global health.</p><p>5) More discussion is about the authors proposal to use tebipenem as a treatment for diarrhoea disease in LMICs regarding the potential cross resistance to other carbapenems. Carbapenems are often used as last-line drugs for seriously ill hospitalised patients. If resistance to tebipenem confers cross resistance to other carbapenems the public health implications of widespread tepipenem use could be highly complex. This is a serious public health and ethical question surrounding the use of tebipenem as proposed. I think some added discussion of what needs to be assessed/quantified to weigh up this risk would really strengthen the manuscript. For example, we need to quantify bystander selection on other gut microbes from tebipenem usage, and assess the degree of cross-resistance of tebipenem resistant mutants to other carbapenems.</p></body></sub-article><sub-article article-type="reply" id="sa2"><front-stub><article-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.69798.sa2</article-id><title-group><article-title>Author response</article-title></title-group></front-stub><body><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Essential revisions:</p><p>While the work is valuable and of broad interest, in its present form it is difficult to fully assess its impact and the validity of the claims.
