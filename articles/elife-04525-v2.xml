Because this is a new prevention strategy, we broadly assessed its effects on the mucosa. In MTN-007, a phase-1, randomized, double-blinded rectal microbicide trial, we used systems genomics/proteomics to determine the effect of tenofovir 1% gel, nonoxynol-9 2% gel, placebo gel or no treatment on rectal biopsies (15 subjects/arm). We also treated primary vaginal epithelial cells from four healthy women with tenofovir in vitro. After seven days of administration, tenofovir 1% gel had broad-ranging effects on the rectal mucosa, which were more pronounced than, but different from, those of the detergent nonoxynol-9. Tenofovir suppressed anti-inflammatory mediators, increased T cell densities, caused mitochondrial dysfunction, altered regulatory pathways of cell differentiation and survival, and stimulated epithelial cell proliferation. The breadth of mucosal changes induced by tenofovir indicates that its safety over longer-term topical use should be carefully monitored.</p><p>Clinical trial registration: NCT01232803.</p><p><bold>DOI:</bold> <ext-link ext-link-type="doi" xlink:href="10.7554/eLife.04525.001">http://dx.doi.org/10.7554/eLife.04525.001</ext-link></p></abstract><abstract abstract-type="executive-summary"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.04525.002</object-id><title>eLife digest</title><p>Tenofovir is a drug that can stop some viruses—including HIV—from multiplying. It is commonly used in multidrug therapies to control HIV infection. Clinical trials are underway to find out whether using the drug in the form of a gel applied to the vagina or rectum could be an effective way to prevent HIV transmission during sex.</p><p>Some of the clinical trials carried out so far have produced promising results. However, since the use of gels containing anti-viral drugs is a new strategy for HIV prevention, there are limited data available about the safety of these products. Previous studies have shown that the concentration of tenofovir in the vagina is much higher in individuals using the gel than in those taking the tablet form of the drug. These high concentrations could lead to unexpected effects on the health of the cells exposed to the gel.</p><p>Here, Hladik, Burgener, Ballweber et al. used a systems biology approach to look at the broad effects of tenofovir gel on tissue from the rectum. Tissue samples taken from the rectums of 15 patients who used tenofovir gel for seven days were compared with tissue samples taken from individuals who used a control gel that did not contain the drug or who did not use any gel.</p><p>Genes that regulate inflammation were suppressed in the rectal tissue from patients who used tenofovir, as were genes that help these tissues regenerate and produce energy. The tissue from these patients also contained more immune cells, suggesting that their local immune systems were more active. Additionally, Hladik, Burgener, Ballweber et al. observed changes that could potentially lead to the increased growth of cells.</p><p>Similar differences were also observed in vaginal cells that had been treated with tenofovir in the laboratory. These findings suggest that tenofovir delivered directly to the vagina or rectum may have unintentional local side effects. However, it is important to acknowledge that tenofovir gel has been evaluated in multiple studies that have not observed overt clinical adverse effects. Therefore, the implication of these findings is currently unclear and warrants further study.</p><p><bold>DOI:</bold> <ext-link ext-link-type="doi" xlink:href="10.7554/eLife.04525.002">http://dx.doi.org/10.7554/eLife.04525.002</ext-link></p></abstract><kwd-group kwd-group-type="author-keywords"><title>Author keywords</title><kwd>HIV/AIDS</kwd><kwd>prevention</kwd><kwd>microbicides</kwd><kwd>mucosa</kwd><kwd>side effect</kwd></kwd-group><kwd-group kwd-group-type="research-organism"><title>Research organism</title><kwd>Human</kwd></kwd-group><funding-group><award-group id="par-1"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000002</institution-id><institution>National Institutes of Health (NIH)</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>U01AI068633</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>McGowan</surname><given-names>Ian</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="par-2"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000002</institution-id><institution>National Institutes of Health (NIH)</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>U19AI082637</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>McGowan</surname><given-names>Ian</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="par-3"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000002</institution-id><institution>National Institutes of Health (NIH)</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>R01HD51455</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Hladik</surname><given-names>Florian</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><funding-statement>The funder had no role in study design, data collection and interpretation, or the decision to submit the work for publication.</funding-statement></funding-group><custom-meta-group><custom-meta><meta-name>elife-xml-version</meta-name><meta-value>2.0</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta specific-use="meta-only"><meta-name>Author impact statement</meta-name><meta-value>Mucosal application of the anti-retroviral drug tenofovir, which is intended to prevent HIV transmission, has many off-target effects on the mucosa itself.</meta-value></custom-meta></custom-meta-group></article-meta></front><body><sec id="s1" sec-type="intro"><title>Introduction</title><p>The HIV prevention field has invested considerable resources in testing the phosphonated nucleoside reverse transcriptase inhibitor (NRTI) tenofovir as a mucosally applied topical microbicide to prevent sexual HIV transmission. In a phase 2B trial, CAPRISA 004, pericoital tenofovir 1% gel was 39% efficacious in preventing vaginal HIV acquisition (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Abdool Karim et al., 2010</xref>). However, in another phase 2B trial, the VOICE study (MTN-003), the daily vaginal tenofovir 1% gel arm was discontinued for futility (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Marrazzo et al., 2015</xref>). Adherence to product use was low in VOICE, likely explaining the differences in findings between the two studies. Currently, the CAPRISA 004 study is being repeated in a phase 3 trial (FACTS 001 study).</p><p>A reduced glycerin formulation of the vaginal tenofovir 1% gel for use as a rectal microbicide appears safe when evaluated by epithelial sloughing, fecal calprotectin, inflammatory cytokine mRNA/protein levels, and cellular immune activation markers (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">McGowan et al., 2013</xref>). However, because topical application of an antiretroviral drug to the mucosa is a novel prevention strategy without clinical precedent, we conducted a comprehensive systems biology assessment of tenofovir gel's effects on the mucosa.</p></sec><sec id="s2" sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><sec id="s2-1"><title>Tenofovir 1% gel induces broad and pronounced gene expression changes in the rectum</title><p>We measured mRNA expression changes across the complete human transcriptome by microarrays in rectal biopsies taken at 9 and 15 cm proximal to the anal margin. Biopsies were obtained before treatment, after a single and after seven consecutive once-daily applications of reduced glycerin tenofovir 1% gel, nonoxynol-9 (N-9) 2% gel, hydroxyethyl cellulose (HEC) placebo gel, or no treatment (eight participants per arm were tested by microarrays).

These results make biological sense given that tenofovir is a DNA chain terminator, with possible off-target effects in human cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Lewis et al., 2003</xref>), and that topical application achieves at least 100-fold higher active drug concentrations in the mucosa than oral administration of 300 mg tenofovir disoproxil fumarate (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Anton et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Hendrix et al., 2013</xref>). Moreover, tenofovir caused similar changes in primary vaginal epithelial cells cultured from several healthy women.</p><p>We did not find evidence that tenofovir directly causes inflammation, which is in keeping with our prior report that rectal tenofovir gel did not cause overt histological inflammation or increased mRNA/protein levels of a select panel of pro-inflammatory cytokines (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">McGowan et al., 2013</xref>). Rather, tenofovir dampened anti-inflammatory factors. Most prominently, it strongly inhibited IL-10 gene and protein expression, likely via blocking of CREB1 and its coactivator CREBBP (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">Martin et al., 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib53">Woodgett and Ohashi, 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Gee et al., 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Alvarez et al., 2009</xref>). In addition, it suppressed signaling pathways downstream of TGF-β, a central anti-inflammatory mediator in the gut (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Konkel and Chen, 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib50">Surh and Sprent, 2012</xref>). Consequently, a number of chemokines were induced, such as the B lymphocyte chemoattractant CXCL13 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Ansel et al., 2002</xref>), and CCL19 and CCL21, both ligands of CCR7 on T lymphocytes and dendritic cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Forster et al., 2008</xref>). Correspondingly, CCR7, the B cell marker CD19, and the T cell markers CD2, CD3D and CD7 increased. In keeping with this, we observed higher densities of CD3<sup>+</sup> and CD7<sup>+</sup> T lymphocytes in the rectal mucosa following 7 days of tenofovir 1% gel use. In concert, these changes suggest that tenofovir creates a state of potential hyper-responsiveness to external inflammatory stimuli but does not itself cause inflammation. In populations who, unlike our MTN-007 study cohort, have a high incidence of mucosal infections and associated immune activation, this could potentially diminish the anti-viral protective effect of topical tenofovir prophylaxis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">Naranbhai et al., 2012</xref>).</p><p>Mitochondrial toxicity of nucleotide/nucleoside reverse transcriptase inhibitors such as tenofovir is well described but the mechanism remains unclear (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Lewis et al., 2003</xref>). We found that tenofovir consistently inhibited expression of PNPT1, which encodes polynucleotide phosphorylase (PNPASE). PNPASE regulates nucleus-encoded RNA import into mitochondria (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib52">Wang et al., 2010</xref>). In PNPT1 knock-out mice, mitochondrial morphology and respiratory capacity are disrupted in a manner quite similar to the disruption in renal proximal tubular cells in patients with tenofovir-induced nephrotoxicity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib42">Perazella, 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib52">Wang et al., 2010</xref>). In our study, just 1 week of daily tenofovir 1% gel application lowered transcription of mitochondrial ATP6 by sixfold and caused visible ultrastructural mitochondrial changes. These findings suggest that tenofovir's suppression of PNPT1 expression may underlie its reported, but heretofore unexplained, mitochondrial toxicity.</p><p>A number of changes in rectal biopsies and primary vaginal epithelial cells also suggested that tenofovir can cause increased epithelial proliferation. Furthermore, tenofovir's negative effect on mitochondrial function could lead to impairment of tumor progenitor cell apoptosis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">Modica-Napolitano et al., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib41">Ni Chonghaile et al., 2011</xref>), as has been specifically reported for loss-of-function mutations of mtATP6, a mitochondrial gene strongly suppressed by tenofovir in our study (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib48">Shidara et al., 2005</xref>). Neoplastic pressure could also arise from the strong induction of KIAA0101 and UBD (ubiquitin D). KIAA0101 is important for regulation of DNA repair (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib56">Simpson et al., 2006</xref>), is increased in tumor tissues (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib54">Yu et al., 2001</xref>), and enhances cancer cell growth (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Jain et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib55">Hosokawa et al., 2007</xref>). UBD appears to increase mitotic non-disjunction and chromosome instability (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib44">Ren et al., 2006</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib45">2011</xref>) and is highly up-regulated in gastrointestinal cancers (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Lee et al., 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib44">Ren et al., 2006</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib45">2011</xref>). Notably, though, these findings remain circumstantial, as there is no actual clinical evidence for carcinogenicity. Nevertheless, they raise the question of whether the relatively high concentrations of tenofovir achieved in the mucosa during topical use could potentially lead to neoplastic lesions with continuous and long-term use. According to Viread's Product Monograph, gastrointestinal tumorigenicity has been observed in mice after high oral dosing of tenofovir disoproxil fumarate. Vaginal tumorigenicity has been documented for azido-thymidine, an NRTI and DNA chain terminator like tenofovir, which induced vaginal hyperplasia and carcinomas when delivered to mice intravaginally as a 2% solution (∼25% carcinoma rate) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Ayers et al., 1996</xref>).</p><p>This is the first time that a systems biology approach has been applied to a clinical trial of mucosal pre-exposure prophylaxis, and our study shows the value of using these technologies for comprehensive mucosal safety assessment. Our findings raise concerns regarding the safety of topical tenofovir 1% gel in the rectum with long-term use. Tenofovir's effects on vaginal epithelial cells suggest similar activities in the vagina, which we are currently verifying in MTN-014, a phase I clinical trial comparing vaginal and rectal tenofovir 1% gel in a cross-over format. Further studies are required to gauge whether tenofovir, which has become a valuable cornerstone drug in treating HIV infection, can also be safely and effectively used as a vaginal or rectal microbicide.</p></sec><sec id="s4" sec-type="materials|methods"><title>Materials and methods</title><sec id="s4-1"><title>Design of the clinical study</title><p>MTN-007 (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://ClinicalTrials.gov">ClinicalTrials.gov</ext-link> registration NCT01232803) was a phase 1, double blind, placebo-controlled trial in which participants were randomized to receive rectal reduced glycerin tenofovir 1%, nonoxynol-9 (N-9) 2% or hydroxyethylcellulose (HEC) gels, or no-treatment (1:1:1:1), at three clinical research sites (Pittsburgh, PA; Birmingham, AL; Boston, MA).

Following an enema with Normosol-R pH 7.4, a flexible sigmoidoscope was inserted into the rectum and biopsies were collected at 15 cm from the anal margin. Following the sigmoidoscopy, a disposable anoscope was inserted into the anal canal for collection of rectal biopsies at 9 cm from the anal margin.

Based on initial titration experiments in which we measured the intracellular concentration of tenofovir diphosphate, the active cellular metabolite of tenofovir, by liquid chromatography-tandem mass spectrometry (performed in the laboratory of Dr Craig Hendrix, Johns Hopkins University), concentrations in the culture media at the lower end (0.05–0.5 mM range) were estimated to be equivalent to the active concentrations likely achieved by topical tenofovir 1% gel (35 mM) in mucosal epithelial cells in vivo (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Hendrix et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">Louissaint et al., 2013</xref>).

The effect of tenofovir 1% gel on the rectal mucosa in vivo was tested in paired comparisons between time point I or VII and time point 0. Each treatment arm was considered separately, and researchers were blinded to treatment arm. The effect of tenofovir on vaginal epithelial cell cultures in vitro was tested in paired comparisons between treated and untreated cultures. Each tenofovir dosage (50 and 500 μM) and time point (1, 4, 7, and 14 days) was considered separately. The Benjamini &amp; Hochberg method for estimating false discovery rates (FDR) was used to control for multiple comparisons (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Benjamini and Hochberg, 1995</xref>). Criteria for significance and relevance were an estimated FDR ≤ 0.05 and a log<sub>2</sub> fold expression change of ≥ 0.5 (induction) or ≤ −0.5 (suppression), respectively. To confirm the results of the in vivo MTN-007 study, we reanalyzed the data using a double subtraction strategy, where the paired differences between time point 0 and time points I or VII within each treatment arm were first calculated for each probe and study participant.

Staining was performed with the following primary antibodies: anti-CD3 (RM9107S, rabbit clone SP7; Thermo Fisher Scientific), anti-ubiquitin D (NBP2-13498, rabbit polyclonal anti-FAT10 antibody; Novus Biologicals, Littleton, CO), anti-CD7 (M7255, mouse clone CBC.37; Dako), and anti-interleukin-10 (sc-8438, mouse clone E−10; Santa Cruz Biotechnology, Dallas, TX). Negative control primary immunoglobulins were either whole rabbit IgG (011-000-003; Jackson ImmunoResearch Laboratories, West Grove, PA) or mouse IgG (I-2000; Vector Laboratories, Burlingame, CA).</p><p>For CD3 staining, the slides were incubated with anti-CD3 for 60 min at a dilution of 1:25, washed in Wash Buffer, incubated for 30 min with sheep-anti-rabbit Dylight 649 (611-643-122; Rockland Immunochemicals, Limerick, PA), washed, and incubated for 30 min with donkey-anti-sheep Dylight 649 (613-743-168; Rockland). Sections were counter-stained for 20 min with the nucleic acid-binding dye Sytox Orange (S11368; Thermo Fisher Scientific) at a dilution of 1:20,000, and coverslipped in ProLong Gold antifade reagent (P36930; Thermo Fisher Scientific). For ubiquitin D (UBD), CD7 and interleukin-10 (IL-10) staining, the slides were incubated with 0.8 μg/ml (UBD and CD7) or 4 μg/ml (IL-10) of the primary antibody for 60 min. After washing, the anti-UBD-stained slides were incubated for 30 min with Leica Power Vision HRP rabbit-specific antibody polymer (PV6119; Leica); and the anti-CD7 and anti-IL-10 stained slides were incubated for 30 min with LeicaPower Vision HRP mouse-specific antibody polymer (PV6114; Leica). After washing, staining was visualized with 3,3′-diaminobenzidine (Liquid DAB+ Substrate Chromogen System; Dako) for 7 min, and the sections were counter-stained for 2 min with hematoxylin (Biocare, Concord, CA). Controls for all antibodies were run with identical procedures but replacing the primary antibodies with either rabbit IgG or mouse IgG, as appropriate, at calculated matching concentrations.</p><sec id="s4-14-1"><title>Acquisition and analysis of stained tissue sections</title><p>Sequences of slightly overlapping 20× (for CD3, UBD or CD7) or 40× (for IL-10) images covering each stained tissue section in its entirety were acquired on a bright-field Aperio Scansope AT (for UBD, CD7 and IL-10) or a fluorescent Aperio Scansope FL (for CD3) (Aperio ePathology Solutions, Leica). Overlapping images were stitched together using the Aperio Image Analysis Suite, and the entire tissue sections on each slide were analyzed using Definiens Tissue Studio (Definiens AG, Germany). Individual cells were identified based on the nuclear counter-stain. For CD3 and CD7, all positive cells were automatically counted and reported as number of positive cells per mm<sup>2</sup> of tissue section. For IL-10 and UBD, tight regions were manually drawn around all areas of the tissue sections containing columnar epithelial cells. For IL-10, all positive columnar epithelial cells were automatically counted and reported as number of positive cells per mm<sup>2</sup>. For UBD, which stained all epithelial cells, the mean staining intensity (MSI) of each columnar epithelial cell was measured in arbitrary units and overall UBD staining intensity for each section was reported as the average MSI of all epithelial cells.</p></sec></sec><sec id="s4-15"><title>Electron microscopy</title><p>Formalin-fixed paraffin-embedded rectal biopsies were de-paraffinized and fixed overnight in half-strength Karnovsky's fixative. Staining, embedding, cutting, and viewing on a JEOL 1400 SX transmission electron microscope were performed as previously described (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Hladik et al., 1999</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">2007</xref>). 20 images per sample were acquired at 5,000× magnification. Using ImageJ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Collins, 2007</xref>), the two-dimensional sizes in µm<sup>2</sup> of all individual mitochondria with a circularity index of ≥0.9 were calculated (for standardization purposes, only mitochondria cut near perfectly along their minor axis were evaluated). 10 images per sample were also acquired at 2,000× magnification, always including the epithelial cell brush border. Using ImageJ, a grid of 1.32 µm<sup>2</sup> squares of defined size was overlaid onto each image. All mitochondria in the images were counted, except those in the first row of squares falling on the brush border and in squares along the image rims (which only partially covered the tissue), and the mean numbers of mitochondria per µm<sup>2</sup> were calculated for each of the acquired 2,000× images (range of counted squares per image: 23–50).</p></sec><sec id="s4-16"><title>General statistics</title><p>All p values reported were adjusted for multiple testing as appropriate, except for the exploratory protein mass spectrometry data. Correlations of log<sub>2</sub> fold gene expression changes between 9 cm and 15 cm biopsies in Figure 1C and Figure 1—figure supplement 1 were tested by Spearman's rank correlation coefficient. Gene and protein expression changes over baseline were compared between study arms by two-tailed Mann–Whitney test (Figure 1—figure supplement 2 and Figure 6). The combined expression data from the microarray and RT-ddPCR tests shown in Figure 2C were compared separately for log-fold induction or suppression over baseline using a one-tailed Wilcoxon signed-rank test with Bonferroni adjustment. Immunohistology measurements in Figure 2D were compared between baseline and after 7 days of treatment by two-tailed paired t tests. Due to high skewness of the CD7<sup>+</sup>, CD3<sup>+</sup>, and IL-10<sup>+</sup> cell counts, these were tested after log<sub>10</sub> transformation. Ratios of induced to suppressed genes in Figure 3A were tested for a difference between cellular compartments using Chi-square statistics. DSP, IL-10, KIAA0101, PNPT1, and ATP6 copy numbers or protein concentrations in Figures 4B,C, 5A,B,F were tested for significant change across three time points by repeated measures ANOVA, and exact Sidak's (Figures 4B,C, 5F) or Tukey (Figure 5A,B) post-tests were run for comparisons between two time points. Due to high skewness of the KIAA0101 copy numbers, these were tested after log<sub>10</sub> transformation. The effect of increasing tenofovir concentrations on the proliferation of primary vaginal epithelial cells in Figure 4E was assessed for significance by a linear model accounting for days and donors. Copy numbers between 9 cm and 15 cm biopsies in Figure 5A were compared by two-tailed paired t test. Copy numbers between baseline tenofovir and N-9 in Figure 5B were compared by a two-tailed unpaired t test. Mitochondria counts and sizes in Figure 5C,D were compared between baseline and Day VII, separately for the two subjects evaluated by electron microscopy, by two-tailed unpaired t tests with Bonferroni adjustment. Microarray chip probe expression values were tested for correlation between the three primary vaginal cell cultures by computing pairwise Pearson correlation coefficients (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1-data">Figure 3—source data 1</xref>). Statistics packages used were Prism 6 (Graphpad Software, La Jolla, CA) and Bioconductor/Lumi in R.

Your article has been favorably evaluated by Prabhat Jha (Senior editor), Sema Sgaier (Reviewing editor), and 3 reviewers, one of whom, Stephen Becker, has agreed to share his identity.</p><p>The Reviewing editor and the reviewers discussed their comments before we reached this decision, and the Reviewing editor has assembled the following comments to help you prepare a revised submission.</p><p>The Reviewing editor and the reviewers agree that this work is very important, timely, comprehensive, and should be published. However, before making a final decision, we would like the minor comments below to be addressed.</p><p>1) It appears that the data reported here are from the use of the reduced glycerin rectal formulation of tenofovir gel. Since there is testing on vaginal mucosa, there may have also been use of the standard formulation. Please ensure that it is clear to the reader which formulation has been used and include in the Discussion whether the authors feel that the findings are pertinent to the formulation examined in efficacy studies.</p><p>2) Methods section:</p><p>a) Paragraph 12 is a bit confusing with regard to understanding which specimen type (vaginal keratinocytes or rectal mucosa) is being tested. It appears to be rectal tissue because of the reference to time point 0, I and VII, however the description is in a paragraph that also discusses testing of the vaginal tissue.</p><p>b) Rectal study:</p><p>Please clarify when the rectal sponge samples were collected (at the same time as the biopsies?).</p><p>Were the samples blinded to the researchers?</p><p>The 1-day and 7-day treatment samples not only differed in treatment duration, but also in timing of sample collection post treatment. The 1-day samples were collected 30-60 min after tenofovir application and would have shown only acute effects, whereas the 7-day samples were collected 24 hours after the last dose and would have shown chronic effects. To more accurately compare differences in gene expression between one-dose vs 7-daily doses, the same post treatment time point(s) should be used for sampling.

Since there is testing on vaginal mucosa, there may have also been use of the standard formulation. Please ensure that it is clear to the reader which formulation has been used and include in the Discussion whether the authors feel that the findings are pertinent to the formulation examined in efficacy studies</italic>.</p><p>The vaginal mucosa was not tested; rather, we isolated primary vaginal epithelial cells from four healthy women and exposed them to tenofovir in vitro. These tenofovir exposures were not done in gel form but as tenofovir dilutions in media. We have revised the Abstract to make this clear.</p><p><italic>2) Methods section</italic>:</p><p><italic>a) Paragraph 12 is a bit confusing with regard to understanding which specimen type (vaginal keratinocytes or rectal mucosa) is being tested. It appears to be rectal tissue because of the reference to time point 0, I and VII, however the description is in a paragraph that also discusses testing of the vaginal tissue</italic>.</p><p>We think the confusion arose from the different nature of in vivo (MTN-007) and in vitro (epithelial cells) data. In vitro, we can treat the same cells with tenofovir or leave them untreated. Therefore, direct pairwise comparisons between treated and untreated cells are possible. In vivo, each subject only received one treatment, and statistical analysis of the in vivo data has to be done in a longitudinal fashion as pairwise longitudinal comparisons between before and after treatment in each subject. In contrast to the more straight forward analysis of the in vitro data, the in vivo data can therefore be analyzed in two different ways, as described in the Methods.</p><p>In the Methods section for statistical microarray analysis, we have now clarified that only the in vivo MTN-007 data were analyzed in two ways, whereas the in vitro data were analyzed in one way.</p><p><italic>b) Rectal study</italic>:</p><p><italic>Please clarify when the rectal sponge samples were collected (at the same time as the biopsies?)</italic>.</p><p>The rectal sponges were at the same visits, immediately before the biopsies were taken. We added this information to the Methods section “Unbiased Mass Spectrometry of Rectal Sponge Eluates”.</p><p><italic>Were the samples blinded to the researchers</italic>?</p><p>Yes. Unblinding of the microarray results was in fact the most surprising moment of the study. We knew (since we did have time point information) that one arm showed a particularly large number of gene expression changes. Based on our initial hypotheses we were convinced that this had to be the nonoxynol-9 (N-9) arm. When it turned out to be the tenofovir arm, we at first thought that a mistake had occurred during unblinding. However, further cross-checking confirmed that 1% tenofovir led to many more changes than 2% N-9. This was borne out by the subsequent in-depth pathway analysis, which revealed mitochondrial changes that are typical for NRTIs but not for N-9, and subsequently the good concordance between the in vivo and the in vitro tenofovir data.</p><p><italic>The 1-day and 7-day treatment samples not only differed in treatment duration, but also in timing of sample collection post treatment. The 1-day samples were collected 30-60 min after tenofovir application and would have shown only acute effects, whereas the 7-day samples were collected 24 hours after the last dose and would have shown chronic effects. To more accurately compare differences in gene expression between one-dose vs 7-daily doses, the same post treatment time point(s) should be used for sampling. The significance of the difference in sample timing at the two treatment time points should be clarified in the text</italic>.</p><p>We have now emphasized this difference better in the text of the Methods section “Mucosal Biopsy Procedures”.</p><p><italic>c) Vaginal cell experiments</italic>:</p><p><italic>Please explain the use of cholera toxin and hydrocortisone in the media, and the effects they may have on inflammatory endpoints</italic>?</p><p>This media formulation is standard for culturing primary epithelial cells since publication of a classic paper in Cell by Rheinwald and Green (Cell 6:331-344; 1975), and many follow-up papers by Jim Rheinwald (Harvard) and others. However, none explains mechanistically why these two particular ingredients are needed. It is true that cholera toxin could be considered as potentially pro-inflammatory and hydrocortisone as potentially anti-inflammatory. However, they were present in all cultures, and therefore their effect should not contribute to differences between tenofovir-treated and -untreated cultures. The two factors could perhaps lead to some changes longitudinally over time, but this is not tested in the in vitro experiments. In vitro, we compare tenofovir-treated and -untreated cells independently at each time point, but we do not compare between different time points.</p><p><italic>If possible, provide more details concerning the vaginal tissue donors (age, hormonal use etc), and quality control measures used for cell cultures (number of passages, lack of contamination with fibroblast or other cell types etc.)</italic>.</p><p>We harvest discarded vaginal tissues under a waiver of consent, which prohibits us from obtaining any clinical or identifying information from the tissue donors. All we know is that the vaginal surgeries are performed for benign conditions. The strong concordance of the raw gene expression data between the three vaginal cell lines tested by microarrays (Figure 3–source data 1) indicates that unknown conditions in the tissue donors, or unknown differences of cell cultures in vitro, did not lead to identifiable outlier results in the in vitro experiments.</p><p><italic>Please explain the significance of the Alamar blue data shown in the supplement</italic>.</p><p>The AlamarBlue data are part of <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4</xref> (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4E</xref>), not the supplement, and indicate that tenofovir enhanced vaginal cell proliferation in vitro.</p><p><italic>3) Discussion section</italic>:</p><p><italic>In the fourth paragraph it states that while KIAA0101 and UBD appear to be affected by tenofovir gel, there is no actual clinical evidence for carcinogenicity. Does this refer to lack of evidence from the data presented here? If so, could it be argued that the exposure/follow up here is sufficient to make such a statement? If based on prior data, such as animal carcinogenesis studies performed as part of preclinical development of tenofovir, this is should be clarified and the studies should be cited</italic>.</p><p>Lack of carcinogenicity cannot be inferred from the short-term data in our study. No peer-reviewed studies exist that demonstrate carcinogenicity for tenofovir, nor do studies exist that reliably rule out carcinogenicity.</p></body></sub-article></article>
