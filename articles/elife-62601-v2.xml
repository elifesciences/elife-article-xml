serves both as a hub for maturation of secreted proteins and as an intracellular calcium storage compartment, facilitating calcium-release-dependent cellular processes. ER calcium depletion robustly activates the unfolded protein response (UPR). However, it is unclear how fluctuations in ER calcium impact organellar proteostasis. Here, we report that calcium selectively affects the dynamics of the abundant metazoan ER Hsp70 chaperone BiP, by enhancing its affinity for ADP. In the calcium-replete ER, ADP rebinding to post-ATP hydrolysis BiP-substrate complexes competes with ATP binding during both spontaneous and co-chaperone-assisted nucleotide exchange, favouring substrate retention. Conversely, in the calcium-depleted ER, relative acceleration of ADP-to-ATP exchange favours substrate release. These findings explain the rapid dissociation of certain substrates from BiP observed in the calcium-depleted ER and suggest a mechanism for tuning ER quality control and coupling UPR activity to signals that mobilise ER calcium in secretory cells.</p></abstract><kwd-group kwd-group-type="author-keywords"><kwd>BiP</kwd><kwd>Grp78</kwd><kwd>calcium</kwd><kwd>endoplasmic reticulum</kwd><kwd>oligomerisation</kwd></kwd-group><kwd-group kwd-group-type="research-organism"><title>Research organism</title><kwd>None</kwd></kwd-group><funding-group><award-group id="fund1"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100004440</institution-id><institution>Wellcome</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>200848/Z/16/Z</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Ron</surname><given-names>David</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund2"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100004440</institution-id><institution>Wellcome</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>996 100140</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Ron</surname><given-names>David</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><funding-statement>The funders had no role in study design, data collection and interpretation, or the decision to submit the work for publication.</funding-statement></funding-group><custom-meta-group><custom-meta specific-use="meta-only"><meta-name>Author impact statement</meta-name><meta-value>Regulation of the endoplasmic reticulum chaperone BiP by calcium.</meta-value></custom-meta></custom-meta-group></article-meta></front><body><sec id="s1" sec-type="intro"><title>Introduction</title><p>The endoplasmic reticulum (ER) of animal cells is distinct in maintaining a high concentration of calcium (Ca<sup>2+</sup>) compared to the surrounding cytoplasm (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Alvarez and Montero, 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Bygrave and Benedetti, 1996</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib52">Meldolesi and Pozzan, 1998</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib69">Solovyova and Verkhratsky, 2002</xref>).

It has long been known that pharmacological manipulations (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib49">Macer and Koch, 1988</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib81">Welch et al., 1983</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib86">Wong et al., 1993</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib87">Wu et al., 1981</xref>) and even physiological cues that deplete ER Ca<sup>2+</sup> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib64">Sans et al., 2002</xref>) activate transducers of the unfolded protein response (UPR), but the role of proteostatic challenge in UPR activation under these conditions remains unclear.</p><p>The folded state of some ER clients, like the low-density lipoprotein receptor (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Fass et al., 1997</xref>), is stabilised by binding Ca<sup>2+</sup> as a ligand. However, the contribution to UPR activity by the proteostatic challenge arising from the mass of proteins whose maturation is directly compromised by low ER Ca<sup>2+</sup> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Cooper et al., 1997</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Guest et al., 1997</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib47">Lodish and Kong, 1990</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib46">Lodish et al., 1992</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib56">Pena et al., 2010</xref>) is unknown.</p><p>Components of the ER protein folding machinery have low-affinity Ca<sup>2+</sup>-binding sites, whose occupancy is likely to decrease upon ER Ca<sup>2+</sup> depletion within the physiological range. Examples are the lectin-like chaperones calnexin (CNX) and calreticulin (CRT) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Baksh and Michalak, 1991</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib77">Wada et al., 1991</xref>), Grp94 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib49">Macer and Koch, 1988</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib75">Van et al., 1989</xref>), and protein disulphide isomerase (PDI) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib41">Lebeche et al., 1994</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib48">Lucero et al., 1994</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib49">Macer and Koch, 1988</xref>). These low-affinity binding sites are often found on N- or C-terminal extensions of the aforementioned proteins, a feature consistent with the observation that their core functions as chaperones or oxidoreductases are not known to be measurably affected at Ca<sup>2+</sup> levels expected in the depleted ER. In the ER, the functionality of these components might be altered, for example through the effects of changing [Ca<sup>2+</sup>]<sup>ER</sup> on their mobility or spatial distribution (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Avezov et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Corbett et al., 1999</xref>), but presently the significance of this feature remains unknown. Upon Ca<sup>2+</sup> release from the ER, changes to cytoplasmic [Ca<sup>2+</sup>] may have indirect effects on the ER environment (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Groenendyk et al., 2014</xref>), but as these are mediated via changes in gene expression, their inherent latency disfavours an important contribution to the rapid post-translational activation of UPR transducers observed in calcium-depleted cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Bertolotti et al., 2000</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Harding et al., 1999</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib86">Wong et al., 1993</xref>).</p><p>Against this background, we were intrigued by the behaviour of the abundant Hsp70-type ER chaperone BiP upon depletion of ER Ca<sup>2+</sup>. Release of ER Ca<sup>2+</sup> has long been known to correlate with disruption of certain BiP-substrate complexes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib71">Suzuki et al., 1991</xref>). Such dissociation occurs very rapidly, on the time-scale of minutes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib60">Preissler et al., 2015</xref>), which is inconsistent with a process driven by the slow build-up of competing unfolded newlyÂ synthesised proteins. ER Ca<sup>2+</sup> depletion is also associated with the appearance of more BiP oligomers (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib60">Preissler et al., 2015</xref>). As chaperoning of unfolded proteins by BiP competes with BiP oligomerisation, the presence of more BiP oligomers is not easy to reconcile with a model whereby a proteostatic challenge arising from the destabilisation of Ca<sup>2+</sup>-binding secreted proteins, or compromised functionality of parallel chaperone systems (e.g. CNX/CRX, PDI), is the major perturbation to ER function imposed by low [Ca<sup>2+</sup>].</p><p>These considerations led us to revisit the effect of ER Ca<sup>2+</sup> depletion on BiP function in cells and in vitro. Here, we report on a molecular basis of ER [Ca<sup>2+</sup>]-dependent regulation of BiPâs functional dynamics under physiological conditions. Our observations provide a plausible explanation for the rapid dissociation of BiP from substrates noted upon ER Ca<sup>2+</sup> depletion and suggest a chain of causality, whereby a primary effect of [Ca<sup>2+</sup>] on BiPâs chaperone cycle gives rise to a secondary proteostatic challenge in the ER.</p></sec><sec id="s2" sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><sec id="s2-1"><title>Divergent effects of ER Ca<sup>2+</sup> depletion and ER proteostatic challenge on trafficking of a model BiP substrate protein</title><p>To gauge the effect of ER Ca<sup>2+</sup> depletion on trafficking of a model BiP substrate protein through the secretory pathway to the plasma membrane, we chose the T-cell antigen receptor Î± (TCRÎ±)Â chain. In absence of other components of the TCR complex, the luminal part of this orphan transmembrane protein interacts with BiP as a substrate and is retained in the ER (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib71">Suzuki et al., 1991</xref>). The reporter consisted of a cleavable, N-terminal ER targeting signal sequence fused to a FLAG-M1 sequence and the ectoplasmic/luminal domain of murine TCRÎ±, followed by a transmembrane domain and a cytosolicallyÂ localised turquoise fluorescent protein (Tq) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1A</xref>). The transmembrane domain of TCRÎ± contains a motif that leads to rapid ER-associated degradation of the orphan subunit (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Bonifacino et al., 1990</xref>). Therefore, it was replaced in this reporter by the transmembrane domain of the interleukin-2 receptor Î± subunit (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Bonifacino et al., 1991</xref>). We anticipated that reporter transport would expose FLAG-M1 on the cell surface, making it accessible for immunostaining on non-permeabilised cells. Further stringency is imparted by the primary FLAG-M1 antibody that only recognises the epitope on the free N-terminus of TCRÎ± following signal sequence removal. The turquoise fluorescence signal is thus a measure of reporter expression, while the FLAG-M1 signal is specific to the surface-exposed fraction.</p><fig-group><fig id="fig1" position="float"><label>Figure 1.</label><caption><title>ER Ca<sup>2+</sup> depletion-dependent trafficking of TCRÎ±-based reporter proteins.</title><p>(<bold>A</bold>) Schematic representation of reporter proteins and detection principles.

To focus the reporter on BiP-mediated regulation, all four glycosylation sites were removed (by single amino acid substitutions), generating a reporter (TCRÎ±-N/Q) that was expressed at lower levels (likely due to enhanced degradation) and was more tightly retained intracellularly under basal conditions and conspicuously exposed on the cell surface upon ER Ca<sup>2+</sup> release (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1A and B</xref>).</p><p>Importantly, both wild-type TCRÎ± and TCRÎ±-N/Q co-immunoprecipitated with BiP and the interaction was slightly but consistently diminished in Tg-treated cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1C</xref>). Binding of ATP to BiP lowers its affinity for substrates and enhances their dissociation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Gaut and Hendershot, 1993</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib54">Munro and Pelham, 1986</xref>), a feature common to the Hsp70 chaperone family. Addition of ATP to the cell lysates strongly decreased co-precipitation of both reporters with BiP, consistent with their binding to BiP as typical substrates (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1C</xref>). Although expressed at lower levels, more BiP was bound to TCRÎ±-N/Q compared to the wild-type version, suggesting that the fate of the mutant reporter more strongly depends on its association with BiP (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1C</xref>, compare lanes 2 and 5). These results agree with a scenario whereby retention of the TCRÎ± proteins in the ER is mediated by their interaction with BiP and Ca<sup>2+</sup> depletion leads to reporter dissociation from BiP, facilitating ER exit and appearance on the cell surface (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib71">Suzuki et al., 1991</xref>).</p><p>This interpretation was further corroborated by the observation that Tg-induced progression of the reporters to the plasma membrane was blocked by brefeldin A (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1âfigure supplement 1</xref>), which disrupts vesicular transport between ER and the Golgi apparatus (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib45">Lippincott-Schwartz et al., 1989</xref>). Moreover, reporter exposure on the cell surface accrued gradually over several hours (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s2">Figure 1âfigure supplement 2</xref>), consistent with the kinetics of vesicular transport between ER and the cell surface (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Chen et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">Hirschberg et al., 1998</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib71">Suzuki et al., 1991</xref>).</p><p>Next, we examined whether reporter display on the plasma membrane could also arise from an increased burden of misfolded ER proteins, or if it is a feature specifically related to low [Ca<sup>2+</sup>]<sup>ER</sup>. We used TCRÎ±-N/Q for these experiments due to its improved ER retention characteristics and because it lacks N-linked glycans, rendering the protein indifferent to the direct effects of pharmacological interference with N-linked glycosylation (see below). Depletion of ER Ca<sup>2+</sup> with the ionophore A23187 also led to accumulation of the reporter on the cell surface (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1D</xref>). In contrast, the reporter remained intracellular upon treatment with tunicamycin (Tm) or 2-deoxyglucose (2DG) â compounds that cause protein misfolding in the ER by interfering with <italic>N</italic>-glycosylation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">Kozutsumi et al., 1988</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">Kurtoglu et al., 2007</xref>). These observations suggest that release of the reporterâs retention by ER Ca<sup>2+</sup> depletion can be uncoupled from a general proteostatic challenge.</p><p>To further address the relationship between proteostatic challenge, ER Ca<sup>2+</sup> depletion, and TCRÎ±-N/Q trafficking, we temporally separated the perturbation to ER protein folding from ER Ca<sup>2+</sup> depletion. Treatment of cells with Tm before addition of Tg diminished ER Ca<sup>2+</sup> depletion-induced reporter exposure on the cell surface (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1E</xref>, compare bars 2 and 4). Furthermore, pharmacological inhibition of basal PERK activity, which increases substrate protein load in the ER by dysregulating the influx of newlyÂ synthesised proteins (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">Harding et al., 2012</xref>), had a similar effect. The combined application of Tm and PERK inhibitor almost fully blocked subsequent Tg-induced reporter trafficking (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1E</xref>, bar 6). Thus, ER stress caused by accumulation of unfolded proteins seems to disfavour reporter export upon Ca<sup>2+</sup> release. However, despite their divergent effects on reporter redistribution, both Ca<sup>2+</sup>-depleting agents and glycosylation inhibitors robustly activated the UPR (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1F</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s3">Figure 1âfigure supplemnet 3</xref>).

The binding of BiP to its substrates is subject to an ATP binding- and hydrolysis-dependent allosteric chaperone cycle. In the ATP-bound state, the NBD and SBD are docked against each other and the SBD adopts an open conformation, allowing fast exchange of substrates. ATP hydrolysis to ADP causes domain undocking and closure of the SBD, leading to tight substrate binding. Nucleotide exchange resets the cycle and triggers substrate release. Under physiological conditions (i.e. in excess of ATP), ATP hydrolysis is considered the rate-limiting step of the cycle due to BiPâs low intrinsic ATPase activity. However, ER-resident J-domain proteins (JDP) enhance BiPâs ATP hydrolysis rate, whereas nucleotide exchange factors (NEF) stimulate ADP release (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Behnke et al., 2015</xref>).</p><fig-group><fig id="fig2" position="float"><label>Figure 2.</label><caption><title>Effect of Ca<sup>2+</sup> on BiPâs ATPase activity.</title><p>(<bold>A</bold>) Schematic representation of BiPâs chaperone cycle.

The latter may be explained by competition between Ca<sup>2+</sup> and Mg<sup>2+</sup> for nucleotides â a CaATP pool is more likely to expose its competitive effect on productive MgATP binding to BiP at JDP-accelerated ATPase rates.

Such differences may relate to the fact that ADP was allowed to accumulate in the assays performed previously, whereas here it was continuously depleted (and ATP regenerated) by the coupled NADH oxidation. However, it is plausible that the presence of ADP might be physiologically relevant and thus important to expose the effect of Ca<sup>2+</sup> on BiPâs function observed in vivo. Corroborating this hypothesis, it has been shown that ADP and Ca<sup>2+</sup> may modulate each otherâs affinity for BiP (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib40">Lamb et al., 2006</xref>).

Our findings agree with these conclusions and suggest that Ca<sup>2+</sup> and Mg<sup>2+</sup> compete for cooperative binding with either nucleotide to BiP. Moreover, the nucleotide release experiments presented here indicate that Ca<sup>2+</sup>âs effect is played out during BiPâ¢nucleotide complex formation rather than by cation swap on existing BiPâ¢nucleotide complexes. In the presence of large excess of Mg<sup>2+</sup> and ATP, productive binding of MgATP to Hsp70s is fast and does not limit the rate of re-entering another round of ATP hydrolysis. However, our observations suggest that in the presence of competing ADP and Ca<sup>2+</sup>, cooperative binding of Ca<sup>2+</sup> with ADP extends the ADP-bound state of BiP during futile ADP-to-ADP exchange, attenuating the chaperone cycle. Increased levels of CaATP, which will also compete with and bind more slowly to BiP than MgATP (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3C</xref>), may further potentiate BiP exchanging MgADP for CaADP . Thus, at expected physiological ATP:ADP ratios in the ER, Ca<sup>2+</sup> has a substantial impact on the kinetics of BiPâs ATPase cycle and stands to influence its chaperone activity.</p></sec><sec id="s2-4"><title>Ca<sup>2+</sup> stabilises interactions between BiP and substrates</title><p>The rate of ADP-to-ATP exchange limits the kinetics with which BiP dissociates from its substrates (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2A</xref>).

Given that Ca<sup>2+</sup> slows down the binding of ATP to BiP (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3C</xref>), it seemed surprising that the average dissociation rate was slightly higher compared to MgATP-induced BiP dissociation. This finding might be explained by poor hydrolysis of CaATP, countering the contribution of ATP-hydrolysis-dependent re-establishment of a stable BiPâ¢substrate complex to the BLI signal arising in the presence of the hydrolysable MgATP.</p><p>In the presence of Mg<sup>2+</sup> and both ATP and ADP ([ATP]/[ADP]=2), the dissociation of BiP from J-domain- and P15-coated BLI sensors was slower compared to a solution containing only Mg<sup>2+</sup> and ATP, consistent with direct competition of ADP with ATP for binding to BiP (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4B</xref>, trace 3). Addition of Ca<sup>2+</sup> ([MgCl<sub>2</sub>]/[CaCl<sub>2</sub>]=3) to a solution containing both nucleotides further inhibited dissociation of BiP (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4B</xref>, trace 4). This result agrees with the notion that Ca<sup>2+</sup> kinetically promotes the ADP- and substrate-bound state of BiP during a futile nucleotide exchange cycle by decreasing the rate of ADP release from BiP.</p><p>To dissect this further, BiPâ¢substrate complexes were assembled on J-domain- and P15-coated BLI sensors (in the presence of MgATP, as above) followed by two sequential dissociation steps. The BiP-loaded sensors were first introduced into solutions containing ADP and either Mg<sup>2+</sup> or Ca<sup>2+</sup> to promote formation of BiPâ¢MgADPâ¢substrate or BiPâ¢CaADPâ¢substrate complexes, which represent the expected intermediates of futile nucleotide exchange. The sensors were then transferred to solutions containing Mg<sup>2+</sup> and ATP. BiP bound to a sensor that had been exposed to Mg<sup>2+</sup> and ADP dissociated twice as fast in the second step than BiP on a sensor that had been exposed to Ca<sup>2+</sup> and ADP (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4B</xref>, compare traces 5 and 6). This observation indicates that the slow release of CaADP kinetically limits ADP-to-ATP exchange and consequently ATP-enhanced dissociation of BiP from substrates. In solutions containing Mg<sup>2+</sup> and a mixture of ATP and ADP ([ATP]/[ADP]=2), the NEF Grp170 enhanced dissociation of BiP from substrate-loaded BLI sensors both in the absence and presence of Ca<sup>2+</sup> to a similar extent (on averageÂ ~2.2- and~2.5-fold, respectively; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4C</xref>). Under these conditions, the stabilising effect of Ca<sup>2+</sup> on BiP-substrate interactions is thus apparent even when nucleotide exchange is stimulated by NEF. The difference in magnitude of Grp170âs relative stimulatory effect on the dissociation of BiPâ¢ADP complexes formed in presence of Ca<sup>2+</sup> (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3A</xref>) and resolution of BiP-substrate interactions (with competing ATP/ADP and Mg<sup>2+</sup>/Ca<sup>2+</sup> being present; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4C</xref>) may reflect in part the potential for establishment of both BiPâ¢CaATP/BiPâ¢CaADP and BiPâ¢MgATP/BiPâ¢MgADP species during multiple exchange cycles that occur in the BLI setup designed to measure the effects of NEF on BiP-substrate interactions and the single turnover nature of the former assay.</p><p>These observations suggest that changes in [Ca<sup>2+</sup>] (within the physiological range) regulate BiPâs chaperone activity by modulating the kinetics of productive nucleotide exchange, and thus the rates of substrate release and entry into the next ATPase cycle. These findings propose a mechanism for the decline in BiP-substrate interactions observed upon ER Ca<sup>2+</sup> depletion. All other things being equal, at high [Ca<sup>2+</sup>]<sup>ER</sup> (resting state) substrate dissociation is slower. Release of Ca<sup>2+</sup> from the ER accelerates ATP binding and substrate dissociation, whereas the rate at which ATP hydrolysis-dependent substrate interactions are formed remains largely unaffected. The acceleration of productive nucleotide exchange and substrate dissociation, relative to substrate binding, partitions BiP from its substrates.</p></sec><sec id="s2-5"><title>Selective responsiveness of ER-localised Hsp70s to Ca<sup>2+</sup></title><p>Ca<sup>2+</sup> excursions within the range shown here to affect BiP activity are unique to the ER. Therefore, we deemed it of interest to determine if regulation by Ca<sup>2+</sup> is a feature selective to ER-localised Hsp70 (i.e. BiP) or common to all Hsp70s, regardless of the Ca<sup>2+</sup> environment in which they operate. To this end, we produced and purified bacterial DnaK, the <italic>Drosophila melanogaster</italic> homologue of BiP, as well as human cytosolic Hsp70 (HSPA1A) and Hsc70 (HSPA8).</p><p>As before, MABA-ADP complexes with the different Hsp70s were formed in the presence of Mg<sup>2+</sup> and nucleotide release upon exposure to excess of ATP was measured.

High-resolution X-ray crystal structures were obtained for all three NBDs (<xref ref-type="table" rid="table1">Table 1</xref>). In each case, additional density in the nucleotide-binding cleft indicated occupancy by ADP (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6s1">Figure 6âfigure supplement 1A</xref>) and the overall conformations of the three NBDs were very similar (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6A</xref>). Overlay of the BiP(NBD) structure with the Hsp70(NBD) and Hsc70(NBD) structures revealed root-mean-squared deviations (RMSD) of 0.769 Ã and 0.734 Ã over the C<sub>Î±</sub> alignment, respectively. Moreover, in each structure, Ca<sup>2+</sup> was identified in the nucleotide-Â binding cleft, where it formed contacts to both phosphate groups (Î± and Î²) of the nucleotide as well as indirect contacts to protein residues via several water molecules (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6A</xref>, inset). The position of the Ca<sup>2+</sup> ion and the coordinated water molecules were nearly identical in all three complexes and similar to a previously reported lowerÂ resolution structure of human BiP bound to CaADP (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib85">Wisniewska et al., 2010</xref>). In contrast, the Mg<sup>2+</sup> ion in an earlier Hsc70(NBD)â¢Mg<sup>2+</sup>â¢ADP structure coordinates only the Î²-phosphate of ADP directly (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6B</xref>, upper panel), which may contribute to the lower affinity of MgADP compared to CaADP for NBD binding. The BiP(NBD)â¢Ca<sup>2+</sup>â¢ADP complex also resembled the structures of BiP(NBD)<sup>apo</sup> and the NBD of BiP<sup>apo</sup> containing both its NBD and SBD (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6s1">Figure 6âfigure supplement 1B</xref>). The location of Ca<sup>2+</sup> is slightly shifted with respect to the position of Mg<sup>2+</sup> in structures that likely reflect the post-hydrolysis state, where the cation coordinates orthophosphate (P<sub>i</sub>) and the Î²-phosphate of ADP (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6B</xref>, lower panel). The latter is more similar to the configuration of Hsp70â¢MgATP complexes, where the Mg<sup>2+</sup> is located between the Î²- and Î³-phosphate groups of ATP (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6s1">Figure 6âfigure supplement 1C</xref>). The Ca<sup>2+</sup> ion in a structure of human Hsp70(NBD) in complex with Ca<sup>2+</sup>, ADP, and P<sub>i</sub> occupies the same position as Mg<sup>2+</sup> in a post-hydrolysis state NBD structure (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6s1">Figure 6âfigure supplement 1D</xref>). Together, these findings reveal that Ca<sup>2+</sup> participates in the coordination of ADP in the NBD, which is consistent with cooperative binding of Ca<sup>2+</sup> and nucleotide to BiP. The structures also imply that binding of Ca<sup>2+</sup> and Mg<sup>2+</sup> is mutually exclusive. This is consistent with evidence against replacement of Mg<sup>2+</sup> by Ca<sup>2+</sup> in the post-hydrolysis complex and with evidence that Ca<sup>2+</sup> binds together with ADP after release of the hydrolysis products (i.e. to the apo NBD) in cycles of ADP rebinding.</p><fig-group><fig id="fig6" position="float"><label>Figure 6.</label><caption><title>Structural analysis of Ca<sup>2+</sup> and ADP binding to Hsp70 nucleotide binding domainsÂ (NBDs).</title><p>(<bold>A</bold>) Ribbon diagram of the aligned crystal structures of BiP (yellow), Hsp70 (blue), and Hsc70 (pink) NBDs in complex with Ca<sup>2+</sup> and ADP.

In contrast, the IC<sub>50</sub> for inhibition of MABA-ADP release from DnaK(NBD) by Ca<sup>2+</sup> was so high (&gt;8 mM) that saturation was not reached over the titration range (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6s2">Figure 6âfigure supplement 2A</xref>). Given that concentrations of Ca<sup>2+</sup> in the cytoplasm are in the nanomolar range, these results imply that the effect of Ca<sup>2+</sup> on ADP binding to cytoplasmic Hsp70s has limited physiological relevance. We also tested the NBD of Kar2, the ER Hsp70 chaperone of yeast (<italic>Saccharomyces cerevisiae</italic>), which had a high IC<sub>50</sub> of 888.0Â Â±Â 233.6 ÂµM (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6s2">Figure 6âfigure supplement 2A</xref>). Thus, regulation by Ca<sup>2+</sup> seems specific to metazoan BiP.</p><p>The NBD structures also revealed a second, surface-exposed Ca<sup>2+</sup> ion that is coordinated by the carboxyl group of D257 and backbone carbonyl of H252 in BiP (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6s3">Figure 6âfigure supplement 3A</xref>) and homologous residues in the cytosolic Hsp70s. This region is implicated as a hinge in the outward movement of NBD domain IIB, that favours bound nucleotide release. Binding of a Ca<sup>2+</sup> ion in that location may disfavour such movement and stabilise the bound nucleotide. However, the significance of this site to Ca<sup>2+</sup>âs selective effect on BiP was called into question for two reasons: Firstly, this location was only found to be occupied in structures from crystals obtained at particularly high Ca<sup>2+</sup> concentrations (but not at low millimolar Ca<sup>2+</sup> concentrations), suggesting low affinity for the cation, and secondly, by the likelihood that this site is accessible to Ca<sup>2+</sup> also when the BiP NBD is occupied with MgADP â circumstances under which Ca<sup>2+</sup> does not retard nucleotide exchange (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3A</xref>). In an effort to resolve this issue experimentally, we mutated D257 in full-length BiP to alanine or asparagine and tested the effect on ADP release. Although the mutations slightly altered the basal and Grp170-stimulated ADP release rates in the presence of only Mg<sup>2+</sup>, both mutants and the wild-type protein showed a similar response to Ca<sup>2+</sup> when added during BiPâ¢nucleotide complex formation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6s3">Figure 6âfigure supplement 3B</xref>). These measurements speak against an important role for this second Ca<sup>2+</sup>-binding site in modulating the ADP-binding properties of BiP.</p><p>Despite their nearly identical CaADP-bound structures, BiP(NBD), Hsp70(NBD), and Hsc70(NBD) share only 70% sequence identity. We speculated that structural variation that is inapparent in the low-energy, crystallised state may nonetheless lead to functionally important differences in thermodynamic stabilisation by Ca<sup>2+</sup> and ADP. Differential scanning fluorimetry (DSF) measurements revealed that binding of ADP to all NBDs substantially elevated their melting temperatures (<italic>T</italic><sub>m</sub>), as observed previously for full-length BiP (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib40">Lamb et al., 2006</xref>).

Importantly, the stabilising effect of Ca<sup>2+</sup> was greatest for mammalian and <italic>Drosophila</italic> BiP(NBD), compared to the cytosolic Hsp70(NBD)s. These findings suggest that the larger decrease in structural flexibility imparted by CaADP binding to the NBD of ER-localised Hsp70s contributes to the relatively stronger inhibition of ADP release by Ca<sup>2+</sup>.</p></sec><sec id="s2-7"><title>Differential sensitivity of BiP oligomers and BiPâ¢substrate complexes to Ca<sup>2+</sup></title><p>The activity of BiP in the ER is subject to post-translational regulatory mechanisms, one of which is the transient sequestration of substrate-free BiP into inactive oligomeric assemblies. These homomeric BiP complexes are based on typical substrate interactions between the SBD of one protomer and the interdomain linker of another protomer (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib60">Preissler et al., 2015</xref>). As a consequence, all BiP molecules of an oligomer are in a post-hydrolysis, domain-undocked state typical of ADP-bound or apo Hsp70s (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7A</xref>). These features entail a chain-like configuration where only the first BiP molecule (A) can bind substrate, whereas the SBDs and linkers of all internal protomers (B) are occupied. Apart from the last molecule (C), which exposes a free linker, all other protomers are conformationally locked and therefore functionally inactive.

This suggests a physiological role of oligomerisation in buffering folding capacity by transient withdrawal of BiP from the pool of active chaperones during periods of declining unfolded protein load. However, the surprising observation that BiP oligomers are enhanced by ER Ca<sup>2+</sup> depletion seems to contradict this function and remained unexplained so far (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib60">Preissler et al., 2015</xref>). We revisited this phenomenon in light of the new insights gleaned here.</p><p>BiP oligomers rapidly disassemble in vitro in the presence of ATP. However, the hypothesised process by which BiP oligomers form and disassemble, described above, predicts that specific inactivation of the âCâ protomer at the (+)-end would render them refractory to the destabilising effect of ATP. We therefore took advantage of the protease subtilisin A (SubA) that cleaves BiP site-specifically at the linker sequence (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib55">Paton et al., 2006</xref>). Under conditions that favour oligomers, a large fraction of BiP is resistant to cleavage by SubA (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib60">Preissler et al., 2015</xref>), likely because only the linker of the âCâ protomer is accessible to the protease, whereas the linkers of all other protomers are protected by an SBD of another BiP protomer (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7A</xref>). Indeed, size-exclusion chromatography (SEC) analysis after exposure of BiP to SubA revealed a shift of all peaks to later elution times, consistent with removal of a single NBD from oligomeric structures and complete cleavage of monomers (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7C</xref>).</p><p>We next formed complexes between BiP and fluorescently-labelled substrate peptide by extended incubation of BiP (at concentrations at which it is largely oligomeric) with trace amounts of the peptide. The samples were then analysed by SEC and substrate peptide fluorescence was detected separately from bulk protein absorbance at 230 nm (A<sub>230</sub>; a signal vastly dominated by BiP). The peptide co-eluted with BiP monomers and oligomers (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7D</xref>, left panels). The stepwise increase in the ratio of A<sub>230</sub> to fluorescence signal with oligomer size is consistent with each oligomeric species exposing only a single binding site [at its (-)-end]. As expected, addition of ATP to the sample shortly before injection into the SEC column converted BiP oligomers largely into monomers, releasing the bound substrate peptide. As noted previously, treatment with SubA prior to SEC shifted the oligomer peaks to later elution times and abolished the monomer signal in both the A<sub>230</sub> and fluorescence channel. However, in contrast to the intact oligomers, the cleaved species were completely insensitive to ATP-induced disassembly and peptide release (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7D</xref>, right panels). We conclude that proteolytic removal of the NBD from the terminal protomer stabilises BiP oligomers by inactivating their only conformationally responsive molecule, the âCâ protomer at the (+)-end. These data also provide evidence for a strictly directional oligomer disassembly mode that proceeds from the (+)-end.</p><p>Their inertness suggested the possibility of separating SubA-cleaved BiP oligomers from other cleavage products by size to enable their biochemical characterisation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7D</xref>). To this end, we incubated purified BiP protein at high concentration with SubA followed by preparative SEC to isolate the early-eluting oligomeric species. Subsequent analytical SEC revealed that the isolated, cleaved oligomers retained their expected elution profile (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7s2">Figure 7âfigure supplement 2</xref>) and proved resistant to ATP-induced disassembly (stable over 3 hr at 26Â°C), and thus deemed suitable for further biochemical characterisation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7s2">Figure 7âfigure supplement 2</xref>).</p><p>MABA-ADP (bound in the presence of Mg<sup>2+</sup>) dissociated from stabilised (SubA-cleaved) BiP oligomers and untreated BiP at similar rates (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7E</xref>). Addition of Ca<sup>2+</sup> ([MgCl<sub>2</sub>]/[CaCl<sub>2</sub>]=3) had a similar inhibitory effect on MABA-ADP dissociation from both samples. In contrast, under these conditions, Grp170 enhanced the rate of MABA-ADP release from stabilised oligomers only â¼2.9-fold, whereas release from untreated BiP was enhanced â¼12.3-fold (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7E</xref>). The latter is consistent with the experiments shown above (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3A</xref>). The relative weakness of Grp170 in encouraging nucleotide exchange on internal protomers of oligomeric BiP may also explain the apparent discrepancy between the marked effect of Grp170 on MABA-ADP exchange noted in the presence of Ca<sup>2+</sup> (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3A</xref>) and the more modest effect of Grp170 on the dissociation of BiP-substrate interactions in the presence of Ca<sup>2+</sup> (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4C</xref>), as assembly of BiP oligomers on the BLI probe would tend to limit the ability of Grp170 to accelerate complex dissociation to the single protomer attached on the (+)-end.</p><p>These results indicate (i) that passive nucleotide exchange occurs with normal rates on BiP oligomers but their conformationally trapped state renders them non-responsive to ATP binding, and (ii) that oligomers are largely resistant to Grp170-stimulated nucleotide release. Together with the finding that BiP oligomers disassemble from one end, these observations suggest a mechanism whereby the relative inertness of the internal protomers kinetically favours BiP oligomers over other BiP-substrate interactions in the Ca<sup>2+</sup>-depleted ER.</p></sec></sec><sec id="s3" sec-type="discussion"><title>Discussion</title><p>The roles of BiP as an abundant effector chaperone and feedback regulator of the UPR render it an essential guardian of ER physiology. Both functions converge on conventional Hsp70 substrate-binding interactions and are subordinate to the kinetics of nucleotide turnover by BiPâs ATPase activity. The finding that BiPâs ATPase cycle is modulated by Ca<sup>2+</sup> fluctuations within the physiological range suggests a defined mechanism that links changes in [Ca<sup>2+</sup>]<sup>ER</sup> to protein homeostasis. In the Ca<sup>2+</sup>-depleted ER, BiP-substrate interactions are destabilised (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8">Figure 8</xref>). The partitioning of substrates away from the only luminal Hsp70 favours trafficking of those substrates that would otherwise have been retained by BiP, whilst promoting de-repression of the UPR transducers, themselves BiP substrates. The perturbation to ER proteostasis is compounded by the polarity of BiP oligomers, which specifies their relative inertness to Ca<sup>2+</sup> fluctuations, thus kinetically driving BiP to oligomerise and depleting the pool of active monomers. Alongside the direct role played by Ca<sup>2+</sup> in the folding of certain secreted proteins, and the role of Ca<sup>2+</sup> binding to low-affinity sites in regulating the in vivo activity of parallel ER chaperones, the aforementioned mechanism goes some way to explain the well-established relationship between ER Ca<sup>2+</sup> depletion and the activation of ER stress signalling.</p><fig-group><fig id="fig8" position="float"><label>Figure 8.</label><caption><title>Ca<sup>2+</sup>-dependent alternative fates of BiP during nucleotide exchange.</title><p>(<bold>A</bold>) High [Ca<sup>2+</sup>]<sup>ER</sup> stabilises BiPâ¢ADPâ¢substrate complexes. The interaction of BiP with its substrates is driven by an ATPase-dependent chaperone cycle, whereby ATP binding triggers substrate release and ATP hydrolysis (to ADP and orthophosphate; P<sub>i</sub>) induces high-affinity substrate binding (right cycle). ADP competes with ATP for binding to BiP during post-hydrolysis nucleotide exchange, causing ADP-to-ADP exchange cycles that delay substrate release. Because Ca<sup>2+</sup> enhances the affinity of ADP for BiP, the substrate interaction-stabilising ADP-bound state of BiP is kinetically favoured by high [Ca<sup>2+</sup>]<sup>ER</sup>, whereas a decline in [Ca<sup>2+</sup>]<sup>ER</sup> accelerates ADP-to-ATP exchange and substrate release. A decrease in the ATP:ADP ratio also promotes ADP-to-ADP exchange and extension of BiP-substrate interactions. (<bold>B</bold>) Observed redistribution of BiP upon ER Ca<sup>2+</sup> depletion.

BiP also participates (both indirectly and by direct interaction with UPR signal transducers) in repression of UPR signalling. The restricted ability of oligomeric BiP to respond allosterically to ATP binding (and the resistance of oligomeric BiP to NEF-stimulated ADP release; not shown) kinetically stabilises oligomers at the expense of heterodimeric BiP-substrate complexes in the Ca<sup>2+</sup>-depleted ER (right panel).

In this vein, the yeast ER Hsp70 Kar2 is of special interest, as we found it to be much less sensitive to Ca<sup>2+</sup> than its metazoan counterparts, despite sharing â¼72% sequence identity in the NBD.

Regardless of its structural basis, it is intriguing to consider how this specialised feature of BiP (conserved from mammals to flies) improves fitness.</p><p>From the pancreatic acinus to killer T cells, secretion of proteins (stored in granules) is regulated by Ca<sup>2+</sup> release from the ER. The destabilising effect of ER Ca<sup>2+</sup> depletion on BiP-substrate complexes may have arisen as a response to situations in which the demands for bulk protein export from the ER (to replenish secreted protein stores) outweighs the benefits of stringent quality control (that would otherwise be imposed by more prolonged BiP-substrate interactions and ER retention). ER quality control responds continuously to the thermodynamic instability of its substrates (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib66">Sekijima et al., 2005</xref>). The dissociation of BiP from a class of not yet natively assembled but export-ready substrates during Ca<sup>2+</sup> signalling events may thus reflect a mechanism for tuning the stringency of quality control to physiological demands.</p><p>Activation of the UPR transducers IRE1, PERK, and ATF6 is a prominent consequence of ER Ca<sup>2+</sup> depletion. Disagreements on the details notwithstanding, most models for UPR regulation acknowledge the importance of BiP-substrate interactions (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">KaragÃ¶z et al., 2019</xref>). In one model, BiP is thought to bind directly to the regulatory luminal domain of the transducers via typical BiP-substrate interactions, to keep them in a repressed state (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Amin-Wetzel et al., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Amin-Wetzel et al., 2017</xref>). Competing substrates displace BiP from the signal transducers resulting in their activation. The findings presented here imply that declining ER Ca<sup>2+</sup> favours dissociation of BiP from UPR signal transducers, which is consistent with previous pulldown experiments showing release of BiP from PERK and ATF6 upon ER Ca<sup>2+</sup> depletion (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Bertolotti et al., 2000</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib68">Shen et al., 2002</xref>). Importantly, BiP dissociation under these conditions is complete on a timescale of minutes and does not require an ongoing supply of nascent unfolded proteins, placing it upstream of any proteostatic challenge arising directly from Ca<sup>2+</sup> depletion. Similarly, dissociation of BiP from substrates may fuel the supply of activating ligands of the UPR transducers (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">KaragÃ¶z et al., 2019</xref>). Physiological fluctuations of Ca<sup>2+</sup> levels are often oscillatory (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Berridge et al., 2000</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Dupont et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib62">Raffaello et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib74">Thomas et al., 1996</xref>).

Given the reversibility of the Ca<sup>2+</sup> effect on BiP and the transient nature of physiological Ca<sup>2+</sup> fluctuations, such conditioning of the ER is likely attained without a significant cost of protein aggregation and proteotoxicity.</p><p>Our findings indicate that Ca<sup>2+</sup> acts mainly on the nucleotide exchange phase of BiPâs chaperone cycle. After post-hydrolysis ADP release, ATP and ADP compete for binding to BiP (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8">Figure 8</xref>). Depending on the outcome of this competition BiP either enters a futile nucleotide exchange cycle through ADP re-binding, or acquires ATP, which triggers substrate release. Ca<sup>2+</sup> enhances the affinity of ADP for BiP and thereby promotes the ADP-bound state during nucleotide exchange. The efficiency of ADP-to-ATP exchange and rates of substrate release are thus inversely related to [Ca<sup>2+</sup>]. As BiP requires MgATP to re-enter its chaperone cycle (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">Kassenbrock and Kelly, 1989</xref>), the rate at which ATP hydrolysis-dependent interactions with substrates are formed remain largely unaffected by Ca<sup>2+</sup>. This rationalises the observed consequences of lowering free Ca<sup>2+</sup> levels in the ER on the interactions of BiP with its substrates: a decrease in [Ca<sup>2+</sup>] enhances the effective rate of ATP-induced substrate release from BiP relative to the rate of substrate binding, leading to a net decline of BiPâ¢substrate complexes.</p><p>Our structural data show that Ca<sup>2+</sup> binds in the nucleotide-binding cleft of the NBD and participates in coordinating the phosphate groups of ADP. This sufficiently explains the observed cooperative binding mode of Ca<sup>2+</sup> and nucleotide to BiP. Although none of our functional experiments indicated that Ca<sup>2+</sup> exerts an allosteric effect on BiP through a mechanism other than by replacing Mg<sup>2+</sup> during nucleotide binding, an additional Ca<sup>2+</sup> ion was present on the surface in all our Hsp70 NBD structures. Ca<sup>2+</sup> binding to this second site is likely an experimental artefact favoured by the high [Ca<sup>2+</sup>] in the crystallisation solution and crystal packing. Moreover, mutation of the second metal-binding site did not affect the responsiveness of BiP to Ca<sup>2+</sup> in ADP release experiments, rendering its relevance to any allosteric regulation of BiP by Ca<sup>2+</sup> improbable.</p><p>Chaperones, in particular BiP, are the most abundant ATPases in the ER (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Bakunts et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Dierks et al., 1996</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Itzhak et al., 2016</xref>). Increasing protein folding load could thus boost ATP consumption by chaperones and temporarily lower the luminal ATP:ADP ratio. Coupling regulation of BiP by Ca<sup>2+</sup> to the ATP:ADP ratio may therefore save energy at basally high luminal [Ca<sup>2+</sup>] by amplifying the effect of ADP as a competitor for ATP and thus lowering BiPâs ATPase activity. Similar principles may apply to chaperone systems in other cellular compartments as well (although there the impact of Ca<sup>2+</sup> is most likely negligible).</p><p>In contrast, ER Ca<sup>2+</sup> depletion might enhance BiPâs ATPase activity. The cost of this to the ER energy balance may be compensated (at least transiently) by an increase in ATP import into the organelle (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib76">Vishnu et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib89">Yong et al., 2019</xref>). Furthermore, the effect on global energetics is mitigated by PERK activation and the attendant decrease in energetically expensive protein synthesis. In this sense, it is interesting to speculate that BiPâs responsiveness to Ca<sup>2+</sup> is an animal cell feature that co-evolved with the acquisition of PERK.</p><p>Likewise, BiP oligomerisation may have evolved to alleviate the consequences of enhanced ATP consumption at low Ca<sup>2+</sup> levels by sequestering BiP in inactive complexes with relatively slow turnover rates under these conditions. Mechanistically, this can be explained by the finding that BiP oligomer disassembly proceeds in a strictly directional manner and thus might be relatively slow compared to the one-step dissociation of heterodimeric BiPâ¢substrate complexes. This difference is likely enhanced at low [Ca<sup>2+</sup>] when ADP-to-ATP exchange is more efficient and the unidirectional, step-wise dissociation of BiP oligomers imposes an even greater relative kinetic penalty, causing a redistribution of BiP from heterodimeric BiPâ¢substrate complexes to oligomers. Furthermore, conformationally trapped oligomeric BiP is largely resistant to stimulated ADP release by Grp170, the most abundant NEF in the ER (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Behnke et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib80">Weitzmann et al., 2007</xref>). Grp170 belongs to the Hsp110 class of NEFs, which bind Hsp70s via a large contact area (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib59">Polier et al., 2008</xref>). It is therefore likely that part of the Grp170-binding site on BiP is sterically occluded in oligomers. The differential action of Grp170 (and potentially other co-factors) on BiPâ¢substrate complexes and oligomers likely contributes to the altered BiP dynamics at varying Ca<sup>2+</sup> levels.</p><p>Changes in BiPâs substrate interaction kinetics are observed within minutes of ER Ca<sup>2+</sup> depletion (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib60">Preissler et al., 2015</xref>). The dissociation of substrates from BiP under conditions of low [Ca<sup>2+</sup>]<sup>ER</sup> may allow some of them to escape retention in the ER and enhance their secretion. This is supported by the behaviour of the BiP-interacting TCRÎ± reporters, which migrated to the cell surface after release of ER Ca<sup>2+</sup>(<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1</xref> and <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib71">Suzuki et al., 1991</xref>). TCRÎ± trafficking to the cell surface is not observed under conditions that primarily perturb protein folding homeostasis, suggesting that this effect of ER Ca<sup>2+</sup> depletion is not a consequence of downstream proteostatic challenge. However, the dominance of the mechanistic link proposed here for TCRÎ±âs itinerary remains unproven, as we are unable to establish a system in which BiPâs essential role as a chaperone is uncoupled from its responsiveness to Ca<sup>2+</sup>. Moreover, destabilisation of BiP-substrate interactions is likely not the only mechanistic connection between ER Ca<sup>2+</sup> release, enhanced protein trafficking, and UPR induction. The downstream perturbation to protein folding arising from substrate release and partitioning of BiP to oligomers may contribute, especially under experimental conditions of protracted ER Ca<sup>2+</sup> depletion following lengthy application of Ca<sup>2+</sup>-mobilising agents or irreversible uptake inhibitors. The action of such parallel mechanism is evident in the escape of misfolded prion precursor protein from the ER quality control upon proteostatic challenge with a reducing agent (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib65">Satpute-Krishnan et al., 2014</xref>). It should be interesting to define in molecular terms the basis for other condition-dependent modulation of ER quality control.</p></sec><sec id="s4" sec-type="materials|methods"><title>Materials and methods</title><table-wrap id="keyresource" position="anchor"><label>Key resources table</label><table frame="hsides" rules="groups"><thead><tr><th valign="top">Reagent type (species) or resource</th><th valign="top">Designation</th><th valign="top">Source or reference</th><th valign="top">Identifiers</th><th valign="top">Additional information</th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td valign="top">Strain, strain background (<italic>Escherichia coli</italic>)</td><td valign="top">M15</td><td valign="top">Qiagen</td><td valign="top"/><td valign="top">Recombinant protein expression</td></tr><tr><td valign="top">Strain, strain background (<italic>Escherichia coli</italic>)</td><td valign="top">BL21 T7 Express lysY/Iq cells</td><td valign="top">New England Biolabs</td><td valign="top">Cat. #: C3013</td><td valign="top">Recombinant protein expression</td></tr><tr><td valign="top">Cell line (<italic>Cricetulus griseus</italic>)</td><td valign="top">CHO-K1</td><td valign="top">ATCC</td><td valign="top">RRID:<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://scicrunch.org/resolver/CVCL_0214">CVCL_0214</ext-link></td><td valign="top"/></tr><tr><td valign="top">Cell line (<italic>Cricetulus griseus</italic>)</td><td valign="top">CHO-K1 CHOP::GFP XBP1::Turquoise (clone S21)</td><td valign="top">PMID:<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/27812215">27812215</ext-link></td><td valign="top">CHO-K1 S21</td><td valign="top">CHO CHOP::GFP, XBP1s::Turquoise dual UPR reporter cell line;

The sensors were then washed in HKTTx until a stable baseline signal was established (V). Association of BiP or other Hsp70s was performed in HKTTx solution containing 3 mM MgCl<sub>2</sub>, 1.5 mM ATP and the indicated proteins at 5 ÂµM (VI). To allow for dissociation, the sensors were transferred to protein-free assay solution with variable components as indicated (VII). The data were processed in Prism 8.4 (GraphPad) and dissociation rate constants were obtained by fitting to a one phase exponential function. When DnaK was analysed (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5C</xref>), a JDP containing the J-domain of DnaJ was immobilised (UK2470).</p></sec><sec id="s4-11"><title>Differential scanning fluorimetry (DSF)</title><p>DSF measurements were performed on a Bio-Rad CFX96 Touch Real-Time PCR Detection System in 96-well plates (Bio-Rad Hard-Shell, cat.Â #Â HSP9601) sealed with transparent adhesive film (Bio-Rad Microseal âBâ Adhessive Sealer, cat.Â #Â MSB1001).

We apologize sincerely for the delay in getting these comments to you. Your article has been reviewed by three peer reviewers, and the evaluation has been overseen by Suzanne Pfeffer as the Senior and Reviewing Editor. The reviewers have opted to remain anonymous.</p><p>The reviewers have discussed the reviews with one another and the Reviewing Editor has drafted this decision to help you prepare a revised submission.</p><p>We would like to draw your attention to changes in our revision policy that we have made in response to COVID-19 (https://elifesciences.org/articles/57162). Specifically, when editors judge that a submitted work as a whole belongs in <italic>eLife</italic> but that some conclusions require a modest amount of additional new data, as they do with your paper, we are asking that the manuscript be revised to either limit claims to those supported by data in hand, or to explicitly state that the relevant conclusions require additional supporting data.</p><p>Our expectation is that the authors will eventually carry out the additional experiments and report on how they affect the relevant conclusions either in a preprint on bioRxiv or medRxiv, or if appropriate, as a Research Advance in <italic>eLife</italic>, either of which would be linked to the original paper.</p><p>Summary:</p><p>For many decades it was an intriguing observation that Ca<sup>2+</sup> release from the endoplasmic reticulum (ER), either due to signalling processes or induced pharmacologically, triggered the unfolding protein response. However, the link between fluctuations of the Ca<sup>2+</sup> concentrations in the ER and protein homeostasis remained unclear. Ron and co-workers investigated the molecular mechanism for this observation with respect to function of the Hsp70 chaperone BiP the main regulator of the unfolding protein response. They found that Ca<sup>2+</sup> ion concentrations in the range of physiological fluctuations in the ER influences BiP-protein substrate complexes such that high Ca<sup>2+</sup> levels reduce nucleotide exchange rates that are limiting for substrate release. This is a particular feature of metazoan ER Hsp70s and not found to a similar extent for yeast ER Hsp70, for eukaryotic cytosolic Hsp70s and for bacterial DnaK. The authors solved the crystal structure of the nucleotide binding domain of mammalian BiP, cytosolic constitutive Hsc70 and cytosolic heat inducible Hsp70 in complex with ADP and Ca<sup>2+</sup> ions and found two Ca<sup>2+</sup> ions bound in similar positions in all structures. Comparison of these structures with an earlier solved crystal structure of the nucleotide binding domain in complex with ADP and Mg<sup>2+</sup> revealed differences that could explain the increased affinity of CaADP as compared to MgADP. Furthermore, by solving the crystal structure of oligomeric BiP and by isolating and characterizing oligomeric species, the authors elucidated the conundrum that BiP oligomers, though representing a substrate type interaction, was much more refractory to Ca<sup>2+</sup>-ion depletion than other BiP-substrate complexes. The experiments are conducted very carefully, and the conclusions drawn seem fully justified. Overall this is an excellent study that very elegantly solved a long-standing question in the Hsp70 field and the enigmatic link between Ca<sup>2+</sup> signalling and proteostasis in the ER.</p><p>Because of the detailed and thoughtful comments of all the reviewers, their reviews are included for your benefit. With regard to what needs to be done, the reviewers provide this essential summary.</p><p>Essential revisions:</p><p>1) To validate the influence of the second Ca-ion in their crystal structure the authors should compare CaADP and MgADP binding to BiP-D257A and BiP-D257N.</p><p>2) To clarify the influence of the NEF Grp170 on substrate release in the presence and absence of Ca-ions the authors should repeat the BLI assay of Figure 4B conditions 3 and 4 +/- Grp170.</p><p>3) The structure of the paper might be more logical if it started with the biochemistry (there is a clear reason to pursue the effects of Ca<sup>2+</sup> on BiP in view of the published record), and then finish with the UPR-relevant experiments, which leave more cell-biological loose ends.</p><p>The other major comments should be addressed by textual addenda.</p><p><italic>Reviewer #1:</italic></p><p>The crystal structure of the BiP-NBD with CaADP showed two Ca<sup>2+</sup>-ions bound to the NBD, one coordinated to Î±- and Î²-phosphate and a second coordinated by the carboxyl group of D257 and the backbone carbonyl of H252. The authors discard this observation, as there is no difference between the different Hsp70s. However, the way in which the second Ca<sup>2+</sup> ion is coordinated is very peculiar as this is exactly at the hinge where subdomain IIB tilts outward upon binding of a nucleotide exchange factor. In the absence of NEFs the equivalent of D252 forms an electrostatic contact to the backbone carbonyl of the equivalent of H252, in the presence of a NEF this contact is broken. It is conceivable that this Ca<sup>2+</sup> ion stabilizes this interaction. It was proposed earlier that the ATP binding cleft opens and closes also in the absence of nucleotide exchange factors to release nucleotide. Thus, the Ca<sup>2+</sup> ion at this position could have a profound effect on nucleotide exchange rates. Such a hypothesis could be tested by mutating D257 to alanine or asparagine. The prediction would be that the effect of Ca<sup>2+</sup>on the exchange rate would be diminished.

Data obtained using a variety of assays with recombinant protein lead the authors to propose a mechanism for substrate release upon Ca<sup>2+</sup> depletion, wherein calcium acts on the nucleotide exchange phase of the BiP catalytic cycle, slowing ADP dissociation from BiP and favoring ADP-to-ADP exchange, which prolongs association of BiP with peptide. A decrease in Ca<sup>2+</sup> is inferred to enhance the effective rate of ATP-induced substrate release, decreasing BiP-substrate complexes. Structures of several Hsp70 NBD show Ca<sup>2+</sup> associated with nucleotide, consistent with a role for Ca<sup>2+</sup> in the ATPase cycle, versus an allosteric role. The authors argue that modulation of the ATPase cycle by calcium is unique to the metazoan BiP; higher levels of Ca<sup>2+</sup> (likely beyond physiological fluctuations) are necessary to slow ADP release for DnaK or yeast BiP. The authors further speculate that increased BiP oligomerization upon Ca<sup>2+</sup> depletion is a consequence of the slow dissociation of oligomers, allowing for a redistribution of BiP from BiP-substrate complexes to oligomers.</p><p>The manuscript presents a large amount of work, including a careful biochemical analysis of BiP. The data are convincing that Ca<sup>2+</sup> (relative to Mg<sup>2+</sup>) alters the rates of nucleotide dissociation and association, which impacts the stability of BiP-substrate complexes. Importantly, the impact of Ca<sup>2+</sup> in vitro falls within the anticipated range of intracellular calcium fluctuations, suggesting that the in vitro data are relevant to the in vivo secretion of substrate observed upon Tg treatment. Although not a major point in the manuscript, few full-length Hsp70 structures exist in the literature, and the presentation of an additional full-length BiP structure adds also to our knowledge base.</p><p>What remains less fully revealed by the presented work is whether the clean in vitro biochemical observations translate fully to the more complex environment of the ER.</p><p>1) It would be informative and strengthen the authors' conclusions if they further assessed how the presence of NEF (Grp170) impacts the differences in ADP, ATP, and peptide association/dissociation in the presence of Mg<sup>2+</sup> and/or Ca<sup>2+</sup>. Are the differences in rates the authors observe in the presence of Mg<sup>2+</sup> vs Ca<sup>2+</sup> abrogated by the presence of NEF, which one expects will be present in the ER at the time of Ca<sup>2+</sup> depletion? For example, how does the presence of Grp170 alter the relative BiP dissociation from substrate under the various Mg<sup>2+</sup>/Ca<sup>2+</sup>/ATP/ADP conditions measured in Figure 4B?</p><p>2) The authors make the interesting observation that increasing the load of folding protein in the ER (e.g. tunicamycin treatment, PERK inactivation) limits the secretion of TCR upon subsequence Ca<sup>2+</sup> depletion. How do the authors explain this observation in light of their model? This observation from Figure 1 is never specifically revisited in the Discussion; however, the authors speculate that increased protein folding load will lower the lumenal ATP:ADP ratio. Are the authors suggesting that a change in ATP:ADP ratio may be the reason cells pretreated with tunicamycin are more recalcitrant to substrate release from BiP upon Ca<sup>2+</sup> depletion? Is PERK inhibition expected to alter the BiP ATPase cycle / alter the ATP:ADP ratio?</p><p>3) It might be helpful if the Figure 8 model was split to depict the changes expected for a Ca<sup>2+</sup> replete and Ca<sup>2+</sup> depleted ER. As drawn the model implies a futile cycle role for Ca-ADP and a normal ATPase cycle for Mg-associated nucleotide. One presumes the authors are depicting a Ca<sup>2+</sup> replete ER? Showing how the relative flux through the catalytic cycle changes upon depletion in a second scheme would help depict the overall manuscript model. Moreover, do the authors presume there is no Ca-ATP in a Ca<sup>2+</sup> replete ER, or just that the Ca-ATP has little role due to a favored associated with Ca-ADP over Ca-ATP? As drawn, the model depicts oligomerization as influenced only by MgATP â in a calcium replete ER, is there a reason why MgATP (versus CaATP) would be the associated nucleotide?</p><p><italic>Reviewer #3:</italic></p><p>As I would expect from the Ron lab, there is nothing much to criticize about the quality of the data.</p><p>This manuscript addresses the role of Ca<sup>2+</sup> in controlling functional properties of BiP.

The data are presented in new Figure 6âfigure supplement 3B (together with the structural model highlighting the second Ca<sup>2+</sup> binding site on BiPâs nucleotide binding domain in panel A). Both mutant proteins showed similar but slightly different basal MABA-ADP release rates compared to wild-type BiP. Importantly, however, like the wild-type protein, both BiP-D257A and BiP-D257N showed much slower MABA-ADP dissociation when nucleotide binding was performed in presence of CaCl<sub>2</sub>. Moreover, in all cases, presence of the nucleotide exchange factor Grp170 in the dissociation phase enhanced MABA-ADP release. These results indicate that the second Ca<sup>2+</sup> binding site (observed in crystal structures of Hsp70 nucleotide binding domains) does not have a major contribution to the mechanism by which Ca<sup>2+</sup> ions affect ADP dissociation from BiP that is studied in this paper.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>2) To clarify the influence of the NEF Grp170 on substrate release in the presence and absence of Ca-ions the authors should repeat the BLI assay of Figure 4B conditions 3 and 4 +/- Grp170.</p></disp-quote><p>As suggested by the reviewers, we have performed the BLI experiments under the conditions 3 and 4 of Figure 4B and included nucleotide exchange factor (NEF) Grp170 during the BiP dissociation phase alongside ATP, ADP, MgCl2 -/+ CaCl<sub>2</sub>. The data are presented in the new panel Figure 4C. The basal BiP dissociation rates in absence and presence of CaCl<sub>2</sub> were comparable to the ones observed in Figure 4B. Under both conditions, Grp170 accelerated BiP dissociation from substrate-loaded BLI sensors to similar extend (on average ~2.2- and ~2.5-fold without and with CaCl<sub>2</sub>, respectively). Therefore, the stabilising effect of Ca<sup>2+</sup> on BiP-substrate interactions is maintained even when nucleotide exchange is stimulated by the presence of NEF. We discuss these results in the manuscript.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>3) The structure of the paper might be more logical if it started with the biochemistry (there is a clear reason to pursue the effects of Ca2+ on BiP in view of the published record), and then finish with the UPR-relevant experiments, which leave more cell-biological loose ends.</p></disp-quote><p>We thank the reviewers for considering this editorial issue and for their suggested improvement. However, after examining the question empirically (in presentations of the data to colleagues) we feel that the narrative benefits from presenting the cell-based experiments first, because these make an important link to the previously-described, but yet unexplained, observations that hint to a significant influence of Ca<sup>2+</sup> on BiPâs functionality and thus provide the conceptual background for the detailed mechanistic studies that follow.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Reviewer #1:</p><p>The crystal structure of the BiP-NBD with CaADP showed two Ca<sup>2+</sup>-ions bound to the NBD, one coordinated to Î±- and Î²-phosphate and a second coordinated by the carboxyl group of D257 and the backbone carbonyl of H252. The authors discard this observation, as there is no difference between the different Hsp70s. However, the way in which the second Ca<sup>2+</sup> ion is coordinated is very peculiar as this is exactly at the hinge where subdomain IIB tilts outward upon binding of a nucleotide exchange factor. In the absence of NEFs the equivalent of D252 forms an electrostatic contact to the backbone carbonyl of the equivalent of H252, in the presence of a NEF this contact is broken. It is conceivable that this Ca<sup>2+</sup> ion stabilizes this interaction. It was proposed earlier that the ATP binding cleft opens and closes also in the absence of nucleotide exchange factors to release nucleotide. Thus, the Ca<sup>2+</sup> ion at this position could have a profound effect on nucleotide exchange rates. Such a hypothesis could be tested by mutating D257 to alanine or asparagine. The prediction would be that the effect of Ca<sup>2+</sup>on the exchange rate would be diminished.
