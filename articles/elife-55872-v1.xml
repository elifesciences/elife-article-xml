can facilitate learning. This paradoxical relationship has made it challenging to tease apart sources of variability that degrade performance from those that improve it. We tackled this question in a context-dependent timing task requiring humans and monkeys to flexibly produce different time intervals with different effectors. We identified two opposing factors contributing to timing variability: slow memory fluctuation that degrades performance and reward-dependent exploratory behavior that improves performance. Signatures of these opposing factors were evident across populations of neurons in the dorsomedial frontal cortex (DMFC), DMFC-projecting neurons in the ventrolateral thalamus, and putative target of DMFC in the caudate. However, only in the thalamus were the performance-optimizing regulation of variability aligned to the slow performance-degrading memory fluctuations. These findings reveal how variability caused by exploratory behavior might help to mitigate other undesirable sources of variability and highlight a potential role for thalamocortical projections in this process.</p></abstract><kwd-group kwd-group-type="author-keywords"><kwd>reinforcement learning</kwd><kwd>behavioral variability</kwd><kwd>timing</kwd><kwd>Thalamus</kwd></kwd-group><kwd-group kwd-group-type="research-organism"><title>Research organism</title><kwd>Rhesus macaque</kwd><kwd>Human</kwd></kwd-group><funding-group><award-group id="fund1"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000065</institution-id><institution>National Institute of Neurological Disorders and Stroke</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>NINDS-NS078127</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Jazayeri</surname><given-names>Mehrdad</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund2"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000893</institution-id><institution>Simons Foundation</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>325542</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Jazayeri</surname><given-names>Mehrdad</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund5"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000893</institution-id><institution>Simons Foundation</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>542993SPI</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Jazayeri</surname><given-names>Mehrdad</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund3"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000872</institution-id><institution>McKnight Endowment Fund for Neuroscience</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Jazayeri</surname><given-names>Mehrdad</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund4"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100001207</institution-id><institution>Esther A. and Joseph Klingenstein Fund</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Jazayeri</surname><given-names>Mehrdad</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><funding-statement>The funders had no role in study design, data collection and interpretation, or the decision to submit the work for publication.</funding-statement></funding-group><custom-meta-group><custom-meta specific-use="meta-only"><meta-name>Author impact statement</meta-name><meta-value>When behavioral outcomes are unfavorable, the brain searches for better outcomes by deliberately increasing its internal variability.</meta-value></custom-meta></custom-meta-group></article-meta></front><body><sec id="s1" sec-type="intro"><title>Introduction</title><p>While interacting with a dynamic and uncertain environment, humans and animals routinely rely on trial-and-error learning strategies to optimize their behavior. This type of learning is most rigorously formulated within the framework of reinforcement learning (RL). The key idea behind RL is to compute a value function for all possible actions based on previous outcomes, and use those action-outcome relationships to guide future actions (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib107">Sutton and Barto, 1998</xref>). RL has been extremely valuable in explaining behavior when an agent has to choose among a small number of discrete options, such as classic multi-armed bandit problems (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Daw et al., 2005</xref>). However, learning through trial and error is also critical when the action space is large and continuous (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Dhawale et al., 2017</xref>). A case in point is when the agent has to adjust the kinematics of its movements based on binary or scalar (unsigned) feedback (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib49">Izawa and Shadmehr, 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib99">Shmuelof et al., 2012a</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Dam et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib124">Wu et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib84">Nikooyan and Ahmed, 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib89">Pekny et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Chen et al., 2017</xref>). In this case, classic RL is not feasible as it requires the agent to compute the value function over an infinitude of parameters (e.g. all the kinematic variables associated with a reach and grasp movement). Moreover, in a continuous state space, errors, no matter how small, interfere with the agent’s ability to update action-outcome relationships.</p><p>How do humans and animals employ trial-and-error learning strategies when the space of possibilities is continuous? One intriguing hypothesis is that the brain directly regulates variability to facilitate learning (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib54">Kao et al., 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib85">Ölveczky et al., 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib111">Tumer and Brainard, 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib44">Huang et al., 2011</xref>). The basic idea is that the agent reduces variability when a trial yields reward (i.e. exploit previously rewarded action) and increases variability in the absence of reward (i.e. explore new possibilities). This strategy captures the spirit of RL in moderating exploration versus exploitation without computing a continuous value function. Several indirect lines of evidence support this hypothesis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib87">Palidis et al., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib49">Izawa and Shadmehr, 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib99">Shmuelof et al., 2012a</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib100">Shmuelof et al., 2012b</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Dam et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib124">Wu et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib84">Nikooyan and Ahmed, 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib89">Pekny et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib114">Vaswani et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Cashaback et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Cashaback et al., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Chen et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Dhawale et al., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib113">van der Kooij and Smeets, 2019</xref>). For example, humans learn more efficiently if the structure of their natural movement variability aligns with the underlying learning objective (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib124">Wu et al., 2014</xref>), reaching movements become more variable during periods of low success rate (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib49">Izawa and Shadmehr, 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib89">Pekny et al., 2015</xref>), and saccades become more variable in the absence of reward (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib108">Takikawa et al., 2002</xref>).</p><p>However, the relationship between variability and learning is nuanced. Although increasing motor variability may play a direct role in the induction of learning (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Dhawale et al., 2017</xref>), one of the primary functions of motor learning is to reduce variability (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Crossman, 1959</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">Harris and Wolpert, 1998</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib110">Thoroughman and Shadmehr, 2000</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib102">Smith et al., 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib105">Sternad and Abe, 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib115">Verstynen and Sabes, 2011</xref>). This two-sided relationship between learning and variability has made it challenging to tease apart behavioral and neural signatures of variability that degrade performance from those that improve it. A rigorous assessment of the interaction between learning and variability demands two important developments. First, we need a method for teasing apart sources of variability that hinder performance from those that facilitate learning. Second, we need to verify that the underlying neural circuits rely on reinforcement to regulate the variability along task-relevant dimensions. Here, we addressed these problems using a motor timing task in which monkeys produced different time intervals using different effectors. We first analyzed behavior and found evidence for multiple sources of motor variability, including memory drift and reward-dependent exploration. We then developed a generative model that could explain how reward regulates variability and facilitates learning. Finally, we probed the underlying neural circuits in multiple nodes of the cortico-basal ganglia circuits implicated in motor timing (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib119">Wang et al., 2018</xref>) and found that the variability across the population of thalamic neurons with projections to the dorsomedial frontal cortex (DMFC) was modulated by reward along task-relevant dimensions in a context-specific manner.</p></sec><sec id="s2" sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><sec id="s2-1"><title>Cue-Set-Go task</title><p>Two monkeys were trained to perform a Cue-Set-Go (CSG) motor timing task (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1A</xref>). On each trial, animals had to produce either an 800 ms (Short) or a 1500 ms (Long) time interval (<italic>t<sub>t</sub></italic>) either with a saccade (Eye) or with a button press (Hand). The task thus consisted of four randomly interleaved trial types, Eye-Short (ES), Eye-Long (EL), Hand-Short (HS), and Hand-Long (HL). The trial type was cued at the beginning of each trial by a fixation cue (‘Cue’). The Cue consisted of a circle and a square: red circle for ES, blue circle for EL, red square for HS, and blue square for HL (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1A</xref>, right). After a random delay, a visual stimulus (‘Tar’) was flashed to the left or right of the screen. This stimulus specified the position of the saccadic target for the Eye trials and served no function in the Hand trials. After another random delay, the presentation of a ‘Set’ flash around the fixation spot indicated the start of the timing period. Animals had to proactively initiate a saccade or press a button such that the produced interval, <italic>t<sub>p</sub></italic>, between Set and movement initiation (‘Go’) would match <italic>t<sub>t</sub></italic>. Reward was provided when the relative error, defined as <italic>e</italic> = (<italic>t<sub>p</sub>-t<sub>t</sub></italic>)/<italic>t<sub>t</sub></italic> (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1A</xref>) was within an experimentally-controlled acceptance window. On rewarded trials, the magnitude of reward decreased linearly with the size of the error. The width of the acceptance window was controlled independently for each trial type using a one-up-one-down staircase procedure (see Materials and methods) so that animals received reward on nearly half of the trials (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1C</xref>, inset).</p><fig id="fig1" position="float"><label>Figure 1.</label><caption><title>Task, behavior, and reward-dependency of variability.</title><p>(<bold>A</bold>) The Cue-Set-Go task.

There were no errors associated with using the wrong effector, and the number of errors with respect to the target interval was extremely small (~0.79% misclassified trials based on fits to a Gaussian mixture model). For both effectors, a robust feature of the behavior was that produced intervals (<italic>t<sub>p</sub></italic>) were more variable for the Long compared to the Short (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1C</xref>). This is consistent with the common observation that timing variability scales with the interval being timed (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Gibbon, 1977</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib69">Malapani and Fairhurst, 2002</xref>).

These nonstationarities are particularly important as they can cause long-term drifts, unstable behavior, and poor performance. Therefore, it is important to tease apart the factors that underlie nonstationary variability, and understand how the brain maintains stable performance in spite of such variability.</p><p>We verified the presence of nonstationary behavior in our data by analyzing the serial correlations of <italic>t<sub>p</sub></italic>.

For example, we asked whether the modulation of <italic>σ</italic>(<italic>e<sup>n</sup></italic>) could be due to differences across (as opposed to within) behavioral sessions. Applying the same analysis to different grouping of trials confirmed that the relationship between variability and reward was present within individual behavioral sessions (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s1">Figure 3—figure supplement 1B</xref>). Similarly, we asked whether the effect of reward on variability was binary (present/absent) or graded (larger variability for lower reward). A more refined binning of trials based on the magnitude of reward provided evidence that the effect was graded: <italic>σ</italic>(<italic>e<sup>n</sup></italic>) was significantly correlated with the magnitude of the previous reward <italic>r<sup>n-1</sup></italic> (Spearman’s correlation, <italic>ρ</italic> = −0.23, ***p=2e-15, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s1">Figure 3—figure supplement 1C</xref>). Finally, the effect of reward was progressively weaker for larger trial lags (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s1">Figure 3—figure supplement 1D–E</xref>) revealing the lingering effects of reward (or lack thereof) beyond single trials. These results provide converging evidence in support of the relationship between reward and behavioral variability.</p><p>Our earlier analysis indicated that the slow memory drifts in the behavior were context-specific (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2B</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s1">Figure 2—figure supplement 1A–B</xref>). For the reward modulation of variability to be effective, it must be also context-specific. That is, an increase in variability following a large error should only be present if the subsequent trial is of the same type. Otherwise, reinforcement of one trial type, say ES, may incorrectly adjust variability in the following trials of another type, say HL, and would interfere with the logic of harnessing reward to calibrate the memory of <italic>t<sub>t</sub></italic>.

Intuitively, this could provide the means for an efficient control strategy: when bias due to memory drift increases, error increases, reward drops, and the animal seeks to find the correct target interval by increasing variability. Indeed, several recent behavioral experiments have found evidence that is qualitatively consistent with this control strategy (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib49">Izawa and Shadmehr, 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib99">Shmuelof et al., 2012a</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Dam et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib124">Wu et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib84">Nikooyan and Ahmed, 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib89">Pekny et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Chen et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Cashaback et al., 2019</xref>).</p><p>To assess this idea rigorously, we aimed to develop a generative model that could emulate this control strategy. We reasoned that the generative process must have two distinct components, one associated with long-term serial correlations due to the memory drift, and another, with the short-term effect of reward on variability. Accordingly, we sought to develop a Gaussian process (GP) model that could capture both effects. This choice was motivated by three factors: (1) GPs automatically describe observations up to their second order statistics, which are the relevant statistics in our data, (2) GPs offer a nonparametric Bayesian fit to long-term serial correlations, and (3) as we will describe, GPs can be readily augmented to regulate variability based on reward.</p><p>GPs are characterized by a covariance matrix – also known as the GP kernel – that specifies the degree of dependence between samples, and thus determines how slowly the samples fluctuate.

Second, the RSGP was also able to capture the modulation of behavioral variability in the probabilistic reward experiment (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5s2">Figure 5—figure supplement 2B</xref>).</p></sec><sec id="s2-7"><title>Alternative models</title><p>To validate our interpretation of behavioral data in terms of the RSGP model, we tested alternative models that might account for the three salient features of the data: (1) long-range <italic>t<sub>p</sub></italic> correlations, (2) the monotonic relationship between <italic>μ</italic>(<italic>e<sup>n</sup></italic>) and <italic>e<sup>n-1</sup></italic>, and (3) the U-shaped relationship between <italic>σ</italic>(<italic>e<sup>n</sup></italic>) and <italic>e<sup>n-1</sup></italic>. The first class of alternative models tested the hypothesis that modulations of <italic>σ</italic>(<italic>e<sup>n</sup></italic>) were controlled by the magnitude of preceding errors, and not by the corresponding rewards (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4A</xref> Right). In this class, we considered several types of GP models without explicit sensitivity to reward, autoregressive models that exhibit serial correlations with no reward-dependency (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib118">Wagenmakers et al., 2004</xref>), and models whose behavior was governed by a mixture of stochastic processes (e.g. Gaussian process mixture models with different variances). None of these models were able to capture all the aforementioned features but we will not discuss these results further since our probabilistic reward control experiment already substantiated the causal role of reward on <italic>σ</italic>(<italic>e<sup>n</sup></italic>) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4D</xref>).</p><p>Next, we considered models that took the reward into account explicitly (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib53">Kaelbling et al., 1996</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib107">Sutton and Barto, 1998</xref>) but whose updating algorithms differed from the RSGP model (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6</xref>).

Overall, the model was able to adjust behavior based on reward (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6s1">Figure 6—figure supplement 1B</xref>). However, upon close examination, we found the behavior of the DS model to be unstable. Specifically, unlike the MCMC and RSGP models (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6s1">Figure 6—figure supplement 1A,C</xref>), the DS model could easily lose track of the target interval and exhibit ‘run-away’ behavior, that is, generate <italic>t<sub>p</sub></italic> values that deviated from <italic>t<sub>t</sub></italic> for an extended number of consecutive trials (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6s1">Figure 6—figure supplement 1B</xref>). Simulating the model with the parameters fit to animals’ behavior, the probability of run-away behavior in a typical 2000 trial session was 65.1 ± 1.2% (see Materials and methods). This brittleness occurs because the updating rule in the DS model cannot implement the directed search when multiple consecutive trials are unrewarded.</p><p>To further assess the DS model, we focused on the subset of DS simulations that did not exhibit run-away behavior, and asked whether they were able to reproduce the key features in our data.

To do so, we performed extensive analyses comparing the behavior of the RSGP model to that of the MCMC and DS models. MCMC and DS can be viewed as autoregressive models whose coefficients depend on past rewards. The MCMC sets all coefficients to zero except a single trial in the past returned by the Metropolis-Hastings sampling algorithm. The DS sets all coefficients to zero except the last two that are determined based on the corresponding reward gradient and a fixed learning rate. The RSGP can also be written in terms of an autoregressive model with nonstationary reward-dependent coefficients and noise. However, the key feature that distinguishes the RSGP is that it performs Bayesian inference over <italic>t<sub>t</sub></italic>. The covariance function (or kernel) of the Gaussian process defines the coefficients and acts as a prior for future samples. The reward-sensitive kernel in the RSGP allows the coefficients to be updated continuously based on the history of past trial outcomes. When the reward rate is high, RSGP implements a strategy that is akin to directed exploration: it increases its reliance on the prior and drives responses toward previously rewarded trials. In contrast, when the reward rate is low, the RSGP relies more on random explorations: it generates samples from a wider distribution. Therefore, RSGP strikes an optimal balance (in the Bayesian sense) between bias (directed exploration) and variance (random exploration) as needed by the history of outcomes.</p><p>The interpretation of the effect of reward in terms of both directed and random explorations predicts that the monotonic relationship between <italic>μ(e<sup>n</sup>)</italic> and <italic>e<sup>n-1</sup></italic>, which we originally explained in terms of memory drift, should additionally be sensitive to trial outcome. To test this prediction, we returned to our probabilistic reward experiment in which trial outcome was dissociated from error magnitude, and asked whether the relationship between <italic>μ(e<sup>n</sup>)</italic> and <italic>e<sup>n-1</sup></italic> was modulated by feedback. Remarkably, results confirmed this prediction. The monotonic relationship between <italic>μ(e<sup>n</sup>)</italic> and <italic>e<sup>n-1</sup></italic> was stronger after trials that subjects received positive feedback (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5s2">Figure 5—figure supplement 2A</xref>), and this effect was consistent with the behavior of the RSGP model (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5s2">Figure 5—figure supplement 2B</xref>). These results indicate that humans and monkeys use a combination of directed and random exploration strategies in accordance with the RSGP model that uses past rewards to adjust both the mean and variance of future responses.</p></sec><sec id="s2-11"><title>Slow fluctuations in the cortico-basal ganglia circuits</title><p>Recently, we identified a cortico-basal ganglia circuit that plays a causal role in animals’ performance during a flexible timing behavior (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib119">Wang et al., 2018</xref>). A combination of population data analysis and modeling revealed that animals control the movement initiation time by adjusting a tonic signal in the thalamus that sets the speed at which activity in the dorsomedial frontal cortex (DMFC) and caudate evolve toward an action-triggering state.

Here, we were able to advance our understanding of the function and neurobiology of variability in three directions. First, we found an important role for memory drifts in timing variability and showed that humans and monkeys use reward to calibrate memory against such drifts. Second, using model-based analysis of behavior, we showed how a combination of directed and random explorations promoted by trial outcome can manifest as modulations of behavioral variability. Finally, we characterized the neural underpinnings of variability associated with memory drifts and trial outcome across populations of neurons within the cortical-basal ganglia circuits.</p><sec id="s3-1"><title>Role of memory drift in behavioral variability</title><p>A key feature of the behavioral data was the presence of slow fluctuations in produced intervals leading to serial correlations extending over minutes and across dozens of trials. These fluctuations have been reported in various behavioral tasks (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">Gilden et al., 1995</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Chen et al., 1997</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib79">Murakami et al., 2017</xref>) and are typically attributed to fatigue, arousal, or other nonspecific factors modulating internal states (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib67">Luck et al., 1997</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib83">Niell and Stryker, 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">Harris and Thiele, 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib56">Kato et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib66">Lee and Dan, 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib116">Vinck et al., 2015</xref>). Although global internal state modulations are likely present in our experiment, they cannot be the only driver since the serial correlations were strongly context-specific. Based on these observations, we reasoned that these fluctuations may reflect drifts in memory. This interpretation was consistent with the results of our control experiment showing diminished serial correlations when memory demands were reduced (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s1">Figure 2—figure supplement 1D</xref>). However, further work is needed to fully characterize the nature of these slow fluctuations. For example, the slow component may be in part a reflection of an active averaging process to maintain a stable memory (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib52">Joiner and Smith, 2008</xref>) as suggested by error-based motor learning studies (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib102">Smith et al., 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib123">Wolpert et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib47">Huberdeau et al., 2015</xref>). Indeed, behavioral results in the probabilistic reward experiment (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5s2">Figure 5—figure supplement 2A</xref>) as well as corresponding fits the RSGP model (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5s2">Figure 5—figure supplement 2B</xref>) suggest that slow fluctuations may in part be controlled by reward-dependent exploratory behavior.</p><p>A more puzzling observation was the specificity of memory drifts with respect to the target interval for the same effector. We currently do not have a definite explanation for this result, but our previous work in the domain of time interval production (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib119">Wang et al., 2018</xref>) and reproduction (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib92">Remington et al., 2018b</xref>) as well as other studies in the motor system (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Afshar et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Ames et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib98">Sheahan et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib40">Hauser et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib117">Vyas et al., 2018</xref>) suggest that several aspects of movement control can be understood in terms of adjusting inputs and initial conditions of a dynamical system (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Churchland et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib91">Remington et al., 2018a</xref>). Accordingly, the interval specificity of the memory drifts suggests that distinct patterns of neural activity set the interval-dependent input and/or initial condition, which is consistent with our previous work (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib119">Wang et al., 2018</xref>).</p></sec><sec id="s3-2"><title>Role of reinforcement in behavioral variability</title><p>In our task, reinforcement is the only information provided experimentally that subjects can use to calibrate their memory of the target interval. Therefore, the computational demands in our task fall squarely within the framework of RL. Most existing RL models have focused on experimental settings in which the agent faces a discrete set of options and/or a limited action space (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Daw et al., 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib41">Hayden et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib65">Lee et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib121">Wilson et al., 2014</xref>). In these situations, RL models posit that the agent keeps track of the value of available options and adopts a suitable policy to choose among them (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib107">Sutton and Barto, 1998</xref>). In our task, subjects have to use reinforcement to choose the correct interval, which is a continuous variable. In theory, RL can be extended to continuous variables, but doing so would require the brain to represent an infinite-dimensional value function, which is implausible. Moreover, in the case of motor timing, produced intervals typically differ from what was intended, and that would interfere with the agent’s ability to correctly evaluate the intended action.</p><p>Due to these complications, recent studies have proposed an alternative explore-exploit strategy for continuous variables in which the agent uses reinforcement to directly regulate behavioral variability (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib111">Tumer and Brainard, 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Fee and Goldberg, 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib124">Wu et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib89">Pekny et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib95">Santos et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Dhawale et al., 2017</xref>). Our results were consistent with this view: variability was modulated by reward in a manner that was consistent with an explore-exploit strategy. This hypothesis was strongly supported by the results of our psychophysical experiment using a probabilistic reward schedule, which confirmed that the trial outcome had a causal effect on behavioral variability (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4</xref>). Another key observation was that the effect of reward on behavioral variability was context-specific (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3</xref>), that is, variability associated with producing a specific interval with a specific effector was most strongly dependent on reward history in trials of the same interval and effector. Given that the memory drifts were also context-specific, this finding indicates that one important function of reward-dependent regulation of variability is to counter memory drifts.</p></sec><sec id="s3-3"><title>Extending RL to continuous variables</title><p>When the action space is discrete as in multi-arm bandit tasks, one can straightforwardly distinguish between exploitation and exploration: exploitation is selecting options that were previously rewarded, and exploration is selecting alternatives about which the agent is uncertain. This distinction, however, is neither straightforward nor helpful when dealing with continuous variables because the state space is too large and all options engender uncertainty. In this scenario, exact exploitation is not possible. Instead, exploitation can be viewed as a form of directed exploration whose objective is to bias responses toward previously rewarded states. This can be contrasted with random explorations that drive responses toward less frequently visited states, and can thus be viewed as increasing variance (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Dhawale et al., 2017</xref>).</p><p>In our experiment, the space of possible responses is continuous and individual responses are inherently variable. Therefore, it is impossible to produce the same exact time interval after a rewarded trial. Accordingly, we formulated the RL problem in terms of moderating directed versus random explorations (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib121">Wilson et al., 2014</xref>). To capture the effect of reward on behavior, we developed a reward-sensitive Gaussian process (RSGP) model that implements a Bayesian updating strategy that simultaneously adjusts the bias and variance. When trial outcomes are better than expected, the RSGP tips the balance toward directed exploration by adjusting the bias, and when the reward drops, it increases variance.</p><p>RSGP was able to capture both the long-term effect of memory drift, and the short-term effect of reward on variability. It also captured behavioral observations in the probabilistic reward experiment where we validated the causal effect of reward on variability (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5s2">Figure 5—figure supplement 2B</xref>). A recent motor learning study in rodents found that the effect of reward on behavioral variability may last a few trials into the future (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Dhawale et al., 2019</xref>). This was also evident in our data (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s1">Figure 2—figure supplement 1D–E</xref>), and RSGP provided a quantitative measure of the temporal extent of this effect (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5B</xref>).</p><p>More generally, the RSGP suggests that categorical distinctions such as exploration versus exploitation or directed versus random explorations might be somewhat arbitrary and ill-defined. Instead, it may be more fruitful to adopt an alternative viewpoint in which the effect of reinforcement is quantified in terms of how trial outcome alters the distribution of future responses (e.g. both the mean and variance). As such, we expect RSGP to help future studies quantify the strength and persistence with which reinforcement guards against ubiquitous non-stationarities in behavior (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib120">Weiss et al., 1955</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib75">Merrill and Bennett, 1956</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib61">Laming, 1979</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">Gilden et al., 1995</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Chen et al., 1997</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Chaisanguanthum et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib79">Murakami et al., 2017</xref>).</p></sec><sec id="s3-4"><title>Memory drift in the cortico-basal ganglia circuits</title><p>Behavioral variability in timing tasks is thought to have a multitude of distributed biophysical and synaptic origins (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Gibbon et al., 1984</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib71">Mauk and Buonomano, 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib88">Paton and Buonomano, 2018</xref>). Several studies have been able to trace this variability in vivo to spiking activity of neurons in cortico-basal ganglia circuits (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib78">Murakami et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib79">Murakami et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">Gouvêa et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Dhawale et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib74">Merchant and Averbeck, 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib119">Wang et al., 2018</xref>). We previously found that a circuit comprised of DMFC, DMFC-projecting thalamus and caudate plays a causal role in the control of movement initiation time (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib119">Wang et al., 2018</xref>) and that certain patterns of activity in each area were correlated with behavioral variability on a trial-by-trial basis. Here, we additionally confirmed that population activity in these areas carries a signal correlated with slow fluctuations of behavior. This finding is broadly consistent with previous studies reporting correlates of internal state changes and/or slow behavioral fluctuations in the thalamus (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">Halassa et al., 2014</xref>), the medial frontal cortex (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib81">Narayanan and Laubach, 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib106">Sul et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib55">Karlsson et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib79">Murakami et al., 2017</xref>), and the caudate (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib64">Lauwereyns et al., 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib63">Lau and Glimcher, 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib95">Santos et al., 2015</xref>). However, the effector- and interval-dependent nature of these fluctuations in our data suggests that they may partially reflect context-specific memory drifts. The key feature of our task that enabled us to uncover this specificity was the alternation between different contexts on a trial-by-trial basis. Since many previous studies did not include this feature, it is possible that certain aspects of neural variability previously attributed to nonspecific internal state changes were in part caused by memory drifts related to specific task rules and parameters. Indeed, drifts and degradation of instrumental memories may be a key limiting factor in motor skill performance (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Ajemian et al., 2013</xref>).</p><p>Although we found a neural correlate of these drifts in all three brain areas, we cannot make a definitive statement about the loci of the underlying synaptic and biophysical drifts. It is likely that the memory has a distributed representation, in which case the drift may result from stochastic processes distributed across multiple brain areas. It is also possible that different contexts engage specific sub-circuits such as corticostriatal synapses (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Fee and Goldberg, 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib125">Xiong et al., 2015</xref>), and circuit-level interactions cause these drift to be present in other nodes of the cortico-basal ganglia circuit.</p><p>For different effectors, context-specificity may be attributed to different patterns of activity across the same population of neurons or by distinct populations of neurons. Our results in the cortico-basal ganglia circuits provided evidence for the former (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8">Figure 8</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8s5">Figure 8—figure supplement 5</xref>). However, we cannot rule out the possibility that this context-specificity arises partially from execution noise within distinct effector-specific downstream areas (e.g. brainstem) as we did not record from those areas. However, execution noise is generally considered to be irreducible (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Faisal et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Dhawale et al., 2017</xref>) and is therefore not expected to be influenced by reinforcement. Previous work suggests that central noise (e.g. in the cortico-basal ganglia circuits) plays a significant role in output variability (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Churchland et al., 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib112">van Beers, 2009</xref>). It is this portion of variability that is likely subject to adjustments through reinforcement.</p></sec><sec id="s3-5"><title>Reinforcement via thalamus</title><p>Next, we asked whether the variability of neural activity in the thalamus, DMFC, and caudate was modulated by reward in the preceding trial in the same context-dependent manner as in the behavior. According to our hypothesis, the key function of the reward-dependent regulation of variability is to counter the memory drifts. This hypothesis makes a specific prediction: reward should modulate the specific pattern of population neural activity that corresponds to memory drifts in the behavior, which we referred to as drift direction. Analysis of neural activity revealed that this effect was present in the thalamus but not in DMFC or caudate. In the thalamus, spike count variability along the drift direction increased after rewarded trials and decreased after unrewarded trials in a context-specific manner. Previous studies have reported that in the thalamus firing rates are modulated on a trial-by-trial basis by attention (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib72">McAlonan et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib94">Saalmann et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib127">Zhou et al., 2016</xref>) and rule/context-dependent computations (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib97">Schmitt et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib119">Wang et al., 2018</xref>). Our work demonstrates that modulation of thalamic activity may additionally subserve reward-based calibration of movement initiation times. It will be important for future studies to investigate whether this finding generalizes to other movement parameters.</p><p>The fact that the same effect was not present in DMFC and caudate serves as a negative control and thus strengthens our conclusions. However, this begs the question of why this regulation was not inherited by DMFC and caudate, especially given that DMFC receives direct input from the region of the thalamus we recorded from. The answer to this question depends on the nature of signal transformations along the thalamocortical pathway. While some experiments have suggested similar response properties for thalamus and their cortical recipients (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib103">Sommer and Wurtz, 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">Guo et al., 2017</xref>), others have found that thalamic signals may undergo specific transformations along the thalamocortical pathway (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib46">Hubel and Wiesel, 1962</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Berman and Wurtz, 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib122">Wimmer et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib97">Schmitt et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib119">Wang et al., 2018</xref>). Therefore, the extent to which we should expect responses in DMFC and thalamus to have similar properties is unclear.</p><p>Our approach for investigating whether the effect of reinforcement was aligned with memory drift was correlative: we used a cross-validated decoding strategy to infer the response pattern most strongly associated with memory drift and tested whether reinforcement exerted its effect along that pattern. According to this analysis, only in the thalamus the two effects were appropriately aligned. However, we cannot rule out the possibility that behavioral control may be mediated by other patterns of activity in the DMFC. Indeed, with a complementary analysis using an unconstrained decoding approach, we were able to find patterns of activity in all three brain areas that simultaneously reflected the effects of memory drift (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7</xref>) and reinforcement (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8s3">Figure 8—figure supplement 3</xref>). Therefore, an important consideration for future work is to use perturbation methods to causally verify the direction in the state space associated with memory drift and reinforcement.</p><p>However, other considerations are consistent with thalamus playing a strong role in controlling timing variability. For example, it has been shown that the inactivation of thalamus has a much stronger effect on modulating animals’ motor timing variability compared to DMFC and caudate (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib119">Wang et al., 2018</xref>). Moreover, the nature of signals in DMFC-projecting thalamus and DMFC during motor timing are different: DMFC neurons have highly heterogeneous response profiles that evolve at different speeds depending on the interval, whereas thalamic neurons carr signals whose strength (i.e. average firing rate) encode the underlying speed. This transformation may provide an explanation for why reward-dependent modulation of firing rates was evident in the thalamus but not in DMFC. As thalamic neurons encode the interval in their average firing rates, it is expected that regulation of timing variability by reward would similarly impact average firing rates. In contrast, in DMFC, the key signal predicting behavior was the speed at which neural trajectories evolved over time – not the neural states along the trajectory. This predicts that reward should alter the variability of the speed of neural trajectories. In principle, it is possible to verify this prediction by estimating the variance of the speed of neural trajectories as a function of reward. However, this estimation is challenging for two reasons. First, speed in a single trial is derived from changes in instantaneous neural states, and the estimation of instantaneous neural states is unreliable unless the number of recorded neurons exceeds the dimensionality of the subspace containing the neural trajectory (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Gao, 2017</xref>). Second, our predictions are about the variance – not mean – of speed, and estimating variance adds another layer of statistical unreliability unless the number of neurons or trials are sufficiently large.</p><p>Nonetheless, we devised a simple analysis to estimate the variance of the speed of neural trajectories across single trials in all three areas (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8s6">Figure 8—figure supplement 6</xref>). As predicted by our hypothesis, the effect of reward on neural activity in the thalamus was different from that in the DMFC and caudate. In thalamus, the reward adjusted the variance of average firing rates, but not the variance of speed . In contrast, in the DMFC and caudate, the reward modulated the variance of the speed at which neural trajectories evolve. Moreover, these effects were present only for consecutive trials associated with the same effector. These results further substantiate our hypothesis that reward regulates variability by adjusting the average firing rates in thalamus, and that this effect leads to the control of the variance of the speed at which neural trajectories evolve in the DMFC and caudate.</p><p>One open question pertains to which brain areas supply the relevant information for the reward-dependent control of behavioral variability. One salient example where cortical variability is adjusted rapidly and in a behaviorally relevant fashion is in the domain of attentional control where spatial cueing can lead to a drop of correlated variability in spiking across sensory cortical neurons whose receptive fields correspond to the cued location (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Cohen and Maunsell, 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib77">Mitchell et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib93">Ruff and Cohen, 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib82">Ni et al., 2018</xref>). While we do not know which areas might directly control motor timing variability, we note that the area of thalamus we have recorded from receives information from three major sources, the frontal cortex, the output nuclei of the basal ganglia, and the deep nuclei of the cerebellum (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib76">Middleton and Strick, 2000</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib59">Kunimatsu et al., 2018</xref>). Modulation of variability prior to movement initiation has been reported in motor and premotor areas (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Churchland et al., 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Churchland et al., 2010</xref>), and distinct correlates of explore-exploit strategy have been found across multiple nodes of the frontal cortex (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib41">Hayden et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib109">Tervo et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Ebitz et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib70">Massi et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib96">Sarafyazd and Jazayeri, 2019</xref>). Therefore, it is possible that modulation of variability in thalamus originates from correlated variability in the frontal cortex. To act as an effective learning mechanism, such correlated variability must be additionally sensitive to reward-dependent neuromodulatory signals such as dopamine (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Frank et al., 2009</xref>) possibly by acting on local inhibitory neurons (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib45">Huang et al., 2019</xref>). The basal ganglia could also play a role in reward-dependent control of thalamic firing rates (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib60">Kunimatsu and Tanaka, 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib59">Kunimatsu et al., 2018</xref>). For example, single neuron responses in substantia nigra pars reticulata that were strongly modulated by reward schedule (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib126">Yasuda and Hikosaka, 2015</xref>) can influence neural responses in the thalamus. Finally, the cerebellum plays a central role in trial-by-trial calibration of motor variables (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib48">Ito, 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib73">Medina and Lisberger, 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib42">Herzfeld et al., 2015</xref>) including movement initiation time (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Ashmore and Sommer, 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib59">Kunimatsu et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib80">Narain et al., 2018</xref>) and thus is a natural candidate for calibrating firing rates in thalamus, although how such calibration could be made reward-sensitive remains an open question (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib43">Hoshi et al., 2005</xref>). In sum, our work provides behavioral, modeling, and neurophysiological evidence in support of the hypothesis that the brain uses reinforcement to regulate behavioral variability in a context-dependent manner.</p></sec></sec><sec id="s4" sec-type="materials|methods"><title>Materials and methods</title><p>Two adult monkeys (<italic>Macaca mulatta</italic>; one female, one male) and five human subjects (18–65 years, two females and three males) participated in the main task.

The trial structure is described in the main Results (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1A</xref>). Here, we only describe the additional details that were not described in the Results. The ‘Cue’ presented at the beginning of each trial consisted of a circle and square. The circle had a radius of 0.2 deg and was presented at the center of the screen. The square had a side of 0.2 deg and was presented 0.5 deg below the circle. For the trial to proceed, the animal had to foveate the circle (i.e. eye fixation) and hold its hand gently on the button (i.e. hand fixation). The animal had to use the hand contralateral to the recorded hemifield. We used an electronic window of 2.5 deg around the circle to evaluate eye fixation, and infrared emitter and detector to evaluate hand fixation. After 500–1500 ms delay period (uniform hazard), a saccade target was flashed eight deg to the left or right of the circle. The saccade target (‘Tar’) had a radius of 0.25 deg and was presented for 250 ms. After another 500–1500 ms delay (uniform hazard), an annulus (‘Set’) was flashed around the circle. The Set annulus had an inner and outer radius of 0.7 and 0.75 deg and was flashed for 48 ms. Trials were aborted if the eye moved outside the fixation window or hand fixation was broken before Set.</p><p>For responses made after Set, the produced interval (<italic>t<sub>p</sub></italic>) was measured from the endpoint of Set to the moment the saccade was initiated (eye trial) or the button was triggered (hand trial). Reward was provided if the animal used the correct effector and <italic>t<sub>p</sub></italic> was within an experimentally controlled acceptance window. For saccade responses, reward was not provided if the saccade endpoint was more than 2.5 deg away from the extinguished saccade target, or if the saccade endpoint was not acquired within 33 ms of exiting the fixation window.</p></sec><sec id="s4-3"><title>Reward function for monkeys in the main task</title><p>The reward was determined by a truncated triangular function of error (<italic>t<sub>p</sub>-t<sub>t</sub></italic>). The maximum reward was 0.5 ml of juice when <italic>t<sub>p</sub> = t<sub>t</sub></italic>. The reward dropped linearly for larger errors so long error was smaller than an acceptance window. For errors larger than the acceptance window, no reward was provided. The acceptance window was adjusted adaptively on a trial-by-trial basis. After each rewarded trial, the acceptance window was made smaller, and after each unrewarded trial, the window was made larger. This so-called one-up-one-down staircase procedure ensured that approximately 50% of the trials were rewarded. The acceptance window for the four trial conditions was set by independent staircases. The change in the size of the acceptance window after each trial was set to 8 and 15 ms for the 800 and 1500 ms target intervals, respectively. As a result of this procedure, animals received reward on nearly half of trials (57% in monkey A and 51% in monkey D). Visual and auditory feedback accompanied rewarded trials. For the visual feedback, either the color of the saccade target (for Eye trials) or the central square (for the Hand trials) turned green. The auditory feedback was one of the computer’s default tones.</p></sec><sec id="s4-4"><title>No-memory control task</title><p>To validate our hypothesis that slow fluctuations in animals’ behavior arose from memory fluctuations, we performed a control experiment in two naive monkeys.

This was done by presenting an additional flash (‘Ready’) shortly before the Set flash such that the interval between Ready and Set was fixed and equal to <italic>t<sub>t</sub></italic>. This effectively removed the need for the animal to hold the target interval in memory.

The DFMC comprises supplementary eye field, dorsal supplementary motor area (i.e. excluding the medial bank), and pre-supplementary motor area. We recorded from the left hemisphere from Monkey A and right from Monkey D, which was contralateral to the preferred hand used in the button press. Recording locations were selected according to stereotaxic coordinates with reference to previous studies as well as each animal’s structural MRI scan. The region of interest targeted in the thalamus was within 1 mm of antidromically identified neurons in the medial portion of the lateral thalamus, also known as Area X. All behavioral and electrophysiological data were timestamped at 30 kHz and streamed to a data acquisition system (OpenEphys). Spiking data were bandpass filtered between 300 Hz and 7 kHz, and spike waveforms were detected at a threshold that was typically set to three times the RMS noise.

Subjects viewed the stimuli binocularly from a distance of approximately 67 cm on a 23-inch monitor (Apple, A1082 LCD) driven by a Mac Pro at a refresh rate of 60 Hz in a dark and quiet room.

For trials of different types, we calculated the Pearson correlation coefficient of pairs of <italic>t<sub>p</sub></italic> of various lags. To clarify our analysis, we use an example of how we estimated the cross correlation between pairs of HS-ES with a trial lag of 10: (1) normalize (z-score) two <italic>t<sub>p</sub></italic> vectors associated with HS and ES in each session; (2) take pairs of HS-ES that are 10 trials apart within each session; (3) combine the pairs across sessions; (4) compute Pearson correlation coefficient.

Since each trial can be of four different types (ES, EL, HS, HL), consecutive trials comprise 16 distinct conditions (e.g. ES-EH, HL-EL, etc.). The limited number of trials in each session limited the reliability of statistics estimated for each individual condition. To gain more statistical power, we combined results across trial types in two ways.

The resulting variable was defined as relative error <italic>e<sup>n</sup></italic> = (<italic>t<sub>p</sub><sup>n</sup>- t<sub>t</sub></italic>)/<italic>t<sub>t</sub></italic>. This reduced the number of conditions by a factor of four, leaving consecutive trials that were either associated with the same effector or with different effectors (e.g. E-E, E-H, H-E, and H-H). We further combined trials to create a ‘same effector’ condition that combined E-E with H-H, and a ‘different effector’ condition that combined E-H with H-E. Animals and human subjects were allowed to take breaks during the experimental sessions. However, the pairs of consecutive trials used in all analyses, regardless of the trial condition, were restricted to the two consequent and completed trials that were no more than 7 s apart.</p><p>We examined the relationship between <italic>μ</italic>(<italic>e<sup>n</sup></italic>) and <italic>e<sup>n-1</sup></italic> using a linear regression model of the form <italic>μ</italic>(<italic>e<sup>n</sup></italic>) <italic>= m<sub>0</sub>+m<sub>1</sub>e<sup>n-1</sup></italic>, and the relationship between <italic>σ</italic>(<italic>e<sup>n</sup></italic>) and <italic>e<sup>n-1</sup></italic> using a quadratic regression model of the form <italic>σ</italic>(<italic>e<sup>n</sup></italic>) <italic>= s<sub>0</sub>+s<sub>1</sub>e<sup>n-1</sup>+s<sub>2</sub></italic>(<italic>e<sup>n-1</sup></italic>)<italic><sup>2</sup></italic>.

To do so, we ordered <italic>t<sub>p</sub></italic> values associated with the same trial type within each behavioral session chronologically and treated them as consecutive samples from the model irrespective of the actual trial lag between them. Although this strategy made the model fitting more tractable, the inferred length constants in units of trials are likely smaller than the true values in the data. For the same reason, the temporal distance in the kernel function was different from the actual trial lag (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2B</xref>). Methods for fitting behavioral data to the RSGP model were adapted from <italic>Gaussian Processes for Machine Learning</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib90">Rasmussen and Williams, 2006</xref>).

Using simulations, we found that optimization through searching the entire parameter space was inefficient and hindered convergence. Therefore, we implemented a two-step optimization.

The optimization of the multivariate likelihood function was achieved by line searching with quadratic and cubic polynomial approximations. The conjugate gradient was used to compute the search directions (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib90">Rasmussen and Williams, 2006</xref>). The landscape of likelihood indicated that the optimization was convex for a wide range of initial values (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5s1">Figure 5—figure supplement 1A</xref>, <xref ref-type="table" rid="table2">Table 2</xref>).</p><p>The RSGP model fit to data provides a prediction of the distribution of <italic>t<sub>p</sub></italic> on each trial based on previous trials (<italic>t<sub>p</sub></italic> and reward history).

We used a two-sample <italic>F</italic>-test to compare the variability of production intervals for different pair-trial conditions (H0: equal variance).</p></sec><sec id="s4-15"><title>Mathematical notation</title><p><table-wrap id="inlinetable1" position="anchor"><table frame="hsides" rules="groups"><thead><tr><th valign="top">Symbol</th><th valign="top">Description</th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td valign="top"><inline-formula><mml:math id="inf16"><mml:mstyle displaystyle="true" scriptlevel="0"><mml:mrow><mml:msubsup><mml:mi>t</mml:mi><mml:mi>p</mml:mi><mml:mi>n</mml:mi></mml:msubsup></mml:mrow></mml:mstyle></mml:math></inline-formula></td><td valign="top">Production time in the n-th trial</td></tr><tr><td valign="top"><inline-formula><mml:math id="inf17"><mml:mstyle displaystyle="true" scriptlevel="0"><mml:mrow><mml:msup><mml:mi>e</mml:mi><mml:mi>n</mml:mi></mml:msup></mml:mrow></mml:mstyle></mml:math></inline-formula></td><td valign="top"><inline-formula><mml:math id="inf18"><mml:mstyle displaystyle="true" scriptlevel="0"><mml:mrow><mml:mo stretchy="false">(</mml:mo><mml:msubsup><mml:mi>t</mml:mi><mml:mi>p</mml:mi><mml:mi>n</mml:mi></mml:msubsup><mml:mo>−</mml:mo><mml:msub><mml:mi>t</mml:mi><mml:mi>t</mml:mi></mml:msub><mml:mo stretchy="false">)</mml:mo><mml:mrow><mml:mo>/</mml:mo></mml:mrow><mml:msub><mml:mi>t</mml:mi><mml:mi>t</mml:mi></mml:msub></mml:mrow></mml:mstyle></mml:math></inline-formula>, relative error of production time in the n-th trial</td></tr><tr><td valign="top"><inline-formula><mml:math id="inf19"><mml:mstyle displaystyle="true" scriptlevel="0"><mml:mrow><mml:mi>μ</mml:mi><mml:mo stretchy="false">(</mml:mo><mml:mi>e</mml:mi><mml:mo stretchy="false">)</mml:mo></mml:mrow></mml:mstyle></mml:math></inline-formula></td><td valign="top">Mean of relative error</td></tr><tr><td valign="top"><inline-formula><mml:math id="inf20"><mml:mstyle displaystyle="true" scriptlevel="0"><mml:mrow><mml:mi>σ</mml:mi><mml:mo stretchy="false">(</mml:mo><mml:mi>e</mml:mi><mml:mo stretchy="false">)</mml:mo></mml:mrow></mml:mstyle></mml:math></inline-formula></td><td valign="top">Standard deviation of relative error</td></tr><tr><td valign="top"><inline-formula><mml:math id="inf21"><mml:mstyle displaystyle="true" scriptlevel="0"><mml:mrow><mml:mi>K</mml:mi><mml:mo stretchy="false">(</mml:mo><mml:mi>i</mml:mi><mml:mo>,</mml:mo><mml:mi>j</mml:mi><mml:mo stretchy="false">)</mml:mo></mml:mrow></mml:mstyle></mml:math></inline-formula></td><td valign="top">Covariance between trial <italic>i</italic> and trial <italic>j</italic></td></tr><tr><td valign="top"><inline-formula><mml:math id="inf22"><mml:mstyle displaystyle="true" scriptlevel="0"><mml:mrow><mml:msup><mml:mi>σ</mml:mi><mml:mn>2</mml:mn></mml:msup></mml:mrow></mml:mstyle></mml:math></inline-formula></td><td valign="top">Signal variance or noise variance associated with a Gaussian process</td></tr><tr><td valign="top"><italic>l</italic></td><td valign="top">The length scale of the squared-exponential covariance function</td></tr><tr><td valign="top"><inline-formula><mml:math id="inf23"><mml:mstyle displaystyle="true" scriptlevel="0"><mml:mrow><mml:msup><mml:mrow><mml:mi mathvariant="normal">r</mml:mi></mml:mrow><mml:mi>n</mml:mi></mml:msup><mml:mo stretchy="false">(</mml:mo><mml:mi>t</mml:mi><mml:mo stretchy="false">)</mml:mo></mml:mrow></mml:mstyle></mml:math></inline-formula></td><td valign="top">Population spiking at time t in the n-th trial</td></tr><tr><td valign="top"><inline-formula><mml:math id="inf24"><mml:mstyle displaystyle="true" scriptlevel="0"><mml:mrow><mml:mi>β</mml:mi></mml:mrow></mml:mstyle></mml:math></inline-formula></td><td valign="top">Regression coefficient</td></tr><tr><td valign="top"><italic>z</italic></td><td valign="top">Projection of population spiking activity onto a low dimensional representation</td></tr></tbody></table></table-wrap></p></sec></sec></body><back><ack id="ack"><title>Acknowledgements</title><p>MJ is supported by NIH (NINDS-NS078127), the Sloan Foundation, the Klingenstein Foundation, the Simons Foundation, the McKnight Foundation, and the McGovern Institute.

Your article has been reviewed by three peer reviewers, including Kunlin Wei as the Reviewing Editor and Reviewer #1, and the evaluation has been overseen by Michael Frank as the Senior Editor. The following individual involved in review of your submission has agreed to reveal their identity: Bruno B Averbeck (Reviewer #2).</p><p>The reviewers have discussed the reviews with one another, and the Reviewing Editor has drafted this decision to help you prepare a revised submission.</p><p>As the editors have judged that your manuscript is of interest, but as described below that additional experiments/analyses are required before it is published, we would like to draw your attention to changes in our revision policy that we have made in response to COVID-19 (https://elifesciences.org/articles/57162). First, because many researchers have temporarily lost access to the labs, we will give authors as much time as they need to submit revised manuscripts. We are also offering, if you choose, to post the manuscript to bioRxiv (if it is not already there) along with this decision letter and a formal designation that the manuscript is &quot;in revision at <italic>eLife</italic>&quot;. Please let us know if you would like to pursue this option. (If your work is more suitable for medRxiv, you will need to post the preprint yourself, as the mechanisms for us to do so are still in development.)</p><p>Summary:</p><p>How variability in motor actions changes with learning is not well understood. The present study starts off with a motor timing task where monkeys and human participants were required to produce timing intervals on the scale of hundreds of milliseconds. Two behavioral features emerge: one is strong correlations of timing produced intervals within effectors and intervals, the other is increased timing variability when the produced intervals were away from the target or mean interval. The first feature is interpreted as a slow drift of timing memory, and the second feature is interpreted as from strategic use of exploratory variance to guard against undesirable variability, i.e., the memory drift. The study provided a computational model to incorporate continuous rewards in the framework of reinforcement learning. Furthermore, the study also correlated the direct recording from the thalamus, DMFC, and caudate to the two behavioral findings, and found that the thalamus showed reward-dependent neural activities with clear effector-specificity. The authors conclude that the nervous system strategically regulates the variability based on reinforcement to reduce the detrimental effect of undesirable variability in the system in the exploration-exploitation framework.</p><p>There was agreement among the reviewers that these results will be of interest to the audience of <italic>eLife</italic>. However, there are critical issues that need to be addressed before the paper being considered for acceptance. The first major concern is essential, given that it is about whether the current data can be interpreted as the way it is.</p><p>Essential revisions:</p><p>1) The main message of the paper is to explain the non-stationarity in the timing variance in the exploration-exploitation framework, but this is questionable. As the reward follows a specific function of timing error, the first derivative of the reward feedback could effectively guide the trial-by-trial modulation of timing behaviors. For example, a decrease in reward would signal a departure from the target interval, which can be used to guide an appropriate response in the next trial. In this case, there is no need to crank up noise with a decrease in reward, as the exploration-exploitation framework would predict. Thus, the observed changes in variance can be explained by trial-by-trial learning based on the explicit reinforcement feedback signal, without invoking the idea of random exploration as in the exploration-exploitation framework. Recent theoretical approaches to model exploration-exploitation behaviors have emphasized both random vs. directed exploration (Wilson et al., 2014), but the current study appears to assume that all exploration should be random. Considering that the task has a 1-D continuous reward function, directed exploration is well possible. This is a critical question given that the main implication of the study is about &quot;…the nervous system makes strategic use of exploratory variance…&quot;. In fact, the whole paper is framed as probing reinforcement-guided exploration as opposed to trial-by-trial supervised learning.</p><p>In a similar vein, the non-stationarity in the variance is caused by the reward magnitude (the specific reward function used here), not necessarily a refutation of stationarity of interval time. It has been acknowledged by the author that this is not a rejection of the interval timing model, but the paper continues to imply it in the Abstract and in the Results.</p><p>Did the subjects not use information from the first derivative of the reward to update their produced intervals? It is not even clear that how many produced intervals fell within the rewarded range, and how many were simply unrewarded. The details of the reward magnitude and the monkey's behavioural adaptations to these changes in reward need to be clarified. To make the original claims of the paper hold, the authors need to clarify whether the results can be explained by simple trial-by-trial adjustments based on the first derivative of the reward function.</p><p>2) The human task with a probabilistic reward has not been directly compared with the monkey experiment, though both are displayed in Figure 5. Related to question 1), can the findings with probabilistic rewards suffice to rule out the possibility that the first derivative of reward feedback is the driving force for the observed variance changes?</p><p>3) The asymmetry of interval variance was evident for both monkeys when the target interval of 1500ms was produced (Figure 1D), but it was left unexplained. This asymmetry shows a much higher variance for the shorter intervals, i.e., skewed to the 800ms target interval. Was this caused by a trivial fact that the monkeys were producing the wrong interval? The data from Monkey D (Figure 1B) appear to suggest this is possible (a few intermediate intervals with the 1500ms target interval). This can be further verified by raw data from Monkey A, which is currently absent in Figure 1. Furthermore, if you use decoding on the neural activity, can you predict whether the monkeys are indeed trying to produce long intervals, in the trials in which they produce long intervals that are too short?</p><p>4) Figure 8—figure supplement 6 shows that speed variability differed between rewarded and unrewarded trials for DMPC and caudate, but not for the thalamus. Does this contradict the implied role of the thalamus in reinforcement learning?</p><p>5) The study highlights the role of the thalamus in reward-based learning; recent studies have hypothesized that fronto-thalamic circuits are necessary for quick processing of complex task-relevant information. Given the task investigated here is also complex (associating reward size to task performance across trials), it is well possible that several areas of frontal cortex are also involved. How to link the current findings to the hypotheses of fronto-thalamic circuits?</p></body></sub-article><sub-article article-type="reply" id="sa2"><front-stub><article-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.55872.sa2</article-id><title-group><article-title>Author response</article-title></title-group></front-stub><body><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Essential revisions:</p><p>1) The main message of the paper is to explain the non-stationarity in the timing variance in the exploration-exploitation framework, but this is questionable.

We are grateful for this comment as it reveals that the emphasis we put on variability caused a serious misunderstanding of the mechanism we proposed. Our findings do not support the notion that the brain simply makes behavior noisy. Indeed, the strategy implemented by our proposed Reward Sensitive Gaussian Process (RSGP) is a combination of directed and random explorations. However, since our original manuscript failed to communicate this point, we have made several revisions throughout the revised manuscript to address this problem.</p><p>The first major revision we made was to add an entire new section and a new figure (Figure 6) where we compare our proposed RSGP model to alternative RL models. In that section, we considered two alternatives, one model that implements an RL sampling algorithm (MCMC, which is more similar to random exploration), and the other, which we refer to as the directed search (DS) model, implements the algorithm suggested by the reviewers: it compares reward in the last two trials; when reward increases, the model moves the estimate in the same direction, and when reward decreases, the model reverses direction. We have provided a detailed explanation of this model in the paper. Both models failed to capture the full gamut of behavioral observations in humans and monkeys. Here, we summarize the failure points of the DS model that was proposed by the reviewers. First, for the same level of behavioral variability and the same reward rate, the DS exhibited runaway behavior (i.e., the model’s output could move arbitrarily far from the target interval). Second, for the subset of simulated sessions that the behavior remained stable, DS was unable to capture the long-term correlations in behavioral responses present in the data. Third, and perhaps most importantly, DS was unable to exhibit the characteristic U-shaped relationship between variability and preceding error. Therefore, the behavior cannot be explained by the DS model.</p><p>The second major revision we made was to include a new section titled “Directed versus random exploration.” In this new section, we highlighted the importance of both directed and random explorations in our own data. The point that we failed to communicate in the original manuscript was that RSGP is <italic>not</italic>​ simply adjusting the variance; RSGP implements Bayesian inference over the desired interval and thus dynamically adjusts both the bias and variance. We noted this point in the original manuscript (“GPs offer a nonparametric Bayesian fit to long-term serial correlations”) but should have gone into further detail, which we have done in this new section. The key section added to the revised manuscript is included below for convenience:</p><p>“To highlight the behavioral characteristics of the RSGP model, it is useful to compare its behavior to that of the MCMC and DS models. MCMC and DS can be viewed as autoregressive models whose coefficients depend on past rewards. The MCMC sets all coefficients to zero except a single trial in the past returned by the Metropolis-Hastings sampling algorithm. The DS sets all coefficients to zero except the last two that are determined based on the corresponding reward gradient and a fixed learning rate. The RSGP can also be written in terms of an autoregressive model with nonstationary reward-dependent coefficients. However, the key feature that distinguishes the RSGP is that it performs Bayesian inference over <italic>t</italic>​​<sub>​</sub>. The covariance function (or kernel) of the Gaussian process defines the coefficients and acts as a prior for future samples. In the RSGP, the addition of a reward-sensitive kernel allows the coefficients to be updated continuously based on the presence or absence of reward. When the reward rate is high, RSGP implements a strategy that is akin to directed exploration: it increases its reliance on the prior and drives responses toward previously rewarded trials. In contrast, when the reward rate is low, the RSGP relies more on random explorations: it generates samples from a wider distribution. Therefore, RSGP strikes a balance (in the Bayesian sense) between bias (directed exploration) and variance (random exploration) as needed by the history of outcomes.”</p><p>Finally, we revised the Discussion to make sure that the importance of both directed and random explorations, as prescribed by the RSGP model, are highlighted. The revised text in the Discussion is copied here for convenience: “A key challenge in the RL literature is to distinguish between conditions in which reinforcement motivates directed versus random explorations. […] Indeed, the RSGP suggests that the distinction between directed and random explorations is somewhat arbitrary, and advocates an alternative viewpoint in which the effect of reinforcement is quantified in terms of how it alters the full distribution of future responses (e.g., both the mean and variance).”</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>In a similar vein, the non-stationarity in the variance is caused by the reward magnitude (the specific reward function used here), not necessarily a refutation of stationarity of interval time. It has been acknowledged by the author that this is not a rejection of the interval timing model, but the paper continues to imply it in the Abstract and in the Results.</p></disp-quote><p>We respectfully disagree. Despite the assumption of stationarity in dominant models of scalar timing, motor timing is inherently non-stationary. There is a rich and extensive literature showing this nonstationarity. These fluctuations have been reported in many tasks (Weiss, Coleman and Green, 1955; Merrill and Bennett, 1956; Gilden, Thornton and Mallon, 1995) and can be relatively strong in movements (Chaisanguanthum, Shen and Sabes, 2014), reaction times (Laming, 1979), and interval timing (Chen, Ding and Kelso, 1997; Murakami et al., 2017). In fact, we do not know of any paper that has shown stationary behavior associated with time interval production from memory. Therefore, the presence of nonstationary motor timing is not controversial (even though dominant models of interval timing do not account for it).</p><p>We are not the first to report these nonstationarities, but, to our knowledge, our work is the first attempt to dissect the factors that contribute to these nonstationarities. Our results identify two contributing factors: memory drift and trial outcome. Our results do not reject scalar variability but it seeks to explain its underlying biological factors. We have revised the text in the relevant section of the Results further stressing the ubiquity of non-stationarity in memory-based motor timing tasks.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Did the subjects not use information from the first derivative of the reward to update their produced intervals?

To address this shortcoming, we have added two new sections in the Materials and methods titled “Reward function for monkeys in the main task” and “Reward function for humans in the main task” where we provide a detailed description of reward contingencies. For example, the section related to animals is as follows:</p><p>“The reward was determined by a truncated triangular function of error (<italic>t</italic>​​<italic>p</italic><sub>​</sub><italic>-t</italic>​<italic>t</italic><sub>​</sub>). […] The auditory feedback was one of the computer’s default tones.”</p><p>Additionally, we highlighted some of the key points that were cause for confusion in the Results section (e.g., the use of one-up-on-down staircase procedure), as follows:</p><p>“Reward was provided when the relative error, defined as <italic>e</italic>​ = (<italic>t</italic>​​<italic>p</italic>​-<italic>t</italic>​​<italic>t</italic>​)/<italic>t</italic>​​<italic>t</italic> was​ within an experimentally-controlled acceptance window. On rewarded trials, the magnitude of reward decreased linearly with the size of the error. The width of the acceptance window was controlled independently for each trial type using a one-up-one-down staircase procedure (see Materials and methods) so that animals received reward on nearly half of the trials (Figure 1C, inset).”</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>To make the original claims of the paper hold, the authors need to clarify whether the results can be explained by simple trial-by-trial adjustments based on the first derivative of the reward function.</p></disp-quote><p>The reviewers ask that we “clarify whether the results can be explained by simple trial-by-trial adjustments based on the first derivative of the reward function.” We can think of two potential interpretations for “the first derivative of the reward function”. One possible interpretation is the change of reward across preceding trials (e.g., the difference of reward in the last two trials). This is exactly the idea behind the alternative DS model that we have tested in the revised manuscript, and discussed in our response to the first major comment (above).</p><p>An alternative interpretation of “the first derivative” is the derivative of the triangular function we used to determine reward magnitude. However, we doubt this is what the reviewers have in mind as this does not provide a coherent explanation of the results. First, the human experiments did not involve a triangular reward function, and yet, behavioral characteristics were similar. Second, it is impossible to infer the derivative of a function from a single sample (e.g., single trial). For example, if on a given trial, the animal receives half the maximum reward, the produced interval could be either slightly longer or slightly shorter than the target interval (due to the symmetry of the reward function), and the animal cannot know which is the case unless it relies on multiple trials (which brings us back to the first interpretation). Third, we found a systematic increase in variability even for the consecutive unrewarded trials (i.e., responses that fall outside the reward triangle) for which the derivative is zero. In sum, we think it is not possible to infer the derivative of a symmetric reward function solely based on the magnitude of the reward in a single trial, and thus the only way to rely on the reward gradient is to rely on more than one preceding trial. In the revised manuscript, we have built such a model (the DS model) and shown that it fails to capture several key features of behavior including the U-shaped relationship between variability and the preceding error. We have also explained that our proposed RSGP model implements a similar strategy but does not suffer from the shortcomings of the DS model because it integrates information on a longer timescale (more than the last two trials).</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>2) The human task with a probabilistic reward has not been directly compared with the monkey experiment, though both are displayed in Figure 5. Related to question 1), can the findings with probabilistic rewards suffice to rule out the possibility that the first derivative of reward feedback is the driving force for the observed variance changes?</p></disp-quote><p>In the original submission, Figure 5 showed the RSGP model fits to behavior in the main experiment – not the probabilistic reward experiment. The results for the probabilistic reward experiment was shown in Figure 4, which did not include any animal experiments. Therefore, we are unsure about which figure and what aspect of the results is being referenced.</p><p>However, we understand the more general question about whether the probabilistic reward experiment can be used to test the DS model. In our response to major comment 1, we listed the multiple reasons why the DS model cannot explain the behavioral results (e.g., does not lead to the U-shaped relationship of variability as a function of the preceding error). In addition, the directed search strategy can move in the wrong direction when the rewards are probabilistic (e.g., when a large error is rewarded by chance). As the reviewers have surmised, the probabilistic reward experiment strengthens the conclusion because the directed search, unlike RSGP, only acts on the mean and not the variance, and thus cannot fully capture the behavioral observation (Figure 5—figure supplement 2).</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>3) The asymmetry of interval variance was evident for both monkeys when the target interval of 1500ms was produced (Figure 1D), but it was left unexplained. This asymmetry shows a much higher variance for the shorter intervals, i.e., skewed to the 800ms target interval. Was this caused by a trivial fact that the monkeys were producing the wrong interval? The data from Monkey D (Figure 1B) appear to suggest this is possible (a few intermediate intervals with the 1500ms target interval). This can be further verified by raw data from Monkey A, which is currently absent in Figure 1.</p></disp-quote><p>The reviewers point to an observation in Figure 1D that the interval variance was asymmetric for the 1500 ms target interval. This asymmetry is due to a number of inconsequential aspects of the data. First, the distribution of produced intervals with respect to the target 1500 ms interval was shifted to the left of the target 1500 ms (Monkey A: -11.0 ms for Eye-Long and -4.3 ms for Hand-Long; Monkey D: -45.3 ms for Eye-Long, and -11.9 ms for Hand-Long). This caused a sampling bias in the density and magnitude of errors on the two sides of the curve. Second, because of this bias, we were able to estimate the curve further out to the left of the 1500 ms (more bins on the short side), which made the curve appear more asymmetric. Third, the presence of scalar variability causes a slight skew in the distribution of produced intervals that further skews the produced interval distribution toward shorter intervals and intensifies the asymmetry. Since these details are not relevant to our main hypothesis, we removed this panel from Figure 1 and replaced it with an example behavioral session from Monkey A as requested by the reviewers.</p><p>However, as part of this comment, the reviewers express concern that perhaps monkeys made categorical mistakes between the Short and Long trial types. To address this concern, we performed a detailed analysis of the produced intervals asking whether animals mixed up between the two target intervals (“monkeys were producing the wrong interval”). To do so, we applied a Gaussian mixture model (GMM) to the full distribution of produced intervals (for both 800 and 1500 ms) and asked whether any of the produced intervals were in the wrong mode with respect to the desired interval. Results indicated that the animals’ behavior was highly stable across trials and sessions and made nearly no categorical mistake between trial conditions. We have clarified this point in the relevant section of the Results: “There were no errors associated with using the wrong effector, and the number of errors with respect to the target interval were extremely small (~0.79% misclassified trials based on fits to a Gaussian mixture model).”</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Furthermore, if you use decoding on the neural activity, can you predict whether the monkeys are indeed trying to produce long intervals, in the trials in which they produce long intervals that are too short?</p></disp-quote><p>The reviewers also asked that we use a neural classifier to determine which of the two intervals the animals’ were aiming to produce. We generally are not in favor of this approach, which assumes that a neural classifier of behavior is a more reliable readout of behavior than the behavior itself. However, for completeness, we performed the suggested analysis. We built a classifier of interval type (Short or Long) based on population spiking data. We used the trials that were correctly classified by the GMM for training the classifier, and asked whether the trials that were misclassified by the GMM were also misclassified by the neural classifier. The performance of the classifier was at chance level (55+/-27% in the thalamus, 45+/-31% in DMFC and 60+/-23% in caudate).</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>4) Figure 8—figure supplement 6 shows that speed variability differed between rewarded and unrewarded trials for DMPC and caudate, but not for the thalamus. Does this contradict the implied role of the thalamus in reinforcement learning?</p></disp-quote><p>We apologize for the lack of clarity. On the contrary, this is a direct prediction of our prior work (Wang et al., 2018). Previously, we found the neurons in the thalamus encode the desired interval by adjusting their tonic firing rate, and not by changing the speed at which firing rates changed over time. In contrast, we found that downstream neurons in DMFC and caudate were largely explained in terms of changing speed. The current results are consistent with and validate those findings.</p><p>In the original manuscript, we had provided an explanation of this point in the Discussion as follows: “Moreover, it has been shown that the nature of signals in DMFC-projecting thalamus and DMFC during motor timing are indeed different: DMFC neurons have highly heterogeneous response profiles that evolved at different speeds depending on the interval, whereas thalamic neurons carried signals whose strength (i.e., average firing rate) encoded the underlying speed.”</p><p>We then went on to explain how this previous finding explains the presence of speed effects in DMFC and not thalamus. We have clarified this in the text as follows: “As predicted by our hypothesis, the effect of reward on neural activity in the thalamus was different from that in the DMFC and caudate. […] These results further substantiate our hypothesis that reward regulates variability by adjusting the average firing rates in thalamus, and that this effect leads to the control of the variance of the speed at which neural trajectories evolve in the DMFC and caudate.”</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>5) The study highlights the role of the thalamus in reward-based learning; recent studies have hypothesized that fronto-thalamic circuits are necessary for quick processing of complex task-relevant information. Given the task investigated here is also complex (associating reward size to task performance across trials), it is well possible that several areas of frontal cortex are also involved. How to link the current findings to the hypotheses of fronto-thalamic circuits?</p></disp-quote><p>We may have misunderstood this comment but it appears that this point was already addressed extensively in two parts of the Discussion in the original manuscript. We have made some minor revisions to those sections with the hope that the point is now more clearly communicated. We have included these sections here for the reviewers’ convenience.</p><p>First section: “we cannot rule out the possibility that behavioral control is mediated by other patterns of activity in the thalamus as well as DMFC. Indeed, with a complementary analysis using an unconstrained decoding approach, we were able to find patterns of activity in all three brain areas that simultaneously reflected the effects of memory drift (Figure 7) and reinforcement (Figure 8—figure supplement 3).”</p><p>Second section: “While we do not know which areas might directly control motor timing variability, we note that the area of thalamus we have recorded from receives information from three major sources, the frontal cortex, the output nuclei of the basal ganglia, and the deep nuclei of the cerebellum (Middleton and Strick, 2000; Kunimatsu et al., 2018). […] To act as an effective learning mechanism, such correlated variability must be additionally sensitive to reward-dependent neuromodulatory signals such as dopamine (Frank et al., 2009) possibly by acting on local inhibitory neurons (Huang et al., 2019).”</p><p>We hope that these Discussion points (which are now further revised to clarify the key points) address the reviewers’ comment.</p></body></sub-article></article>
