development, stress, and disease. Yet little is known about m6A function in <italic>Saccharomyces cerevisiae</italic>, which occurs solely during early meiosis. Here, we perform a multifaceted analysis of the m6A reader protein Pho92/Mrb1. Cross-linking immunoprecipitation analysis reveals that Pho92 associates with the 3’end of meiotic mRNAs in both an m6A-dependent and independent manner. Within cells, Pho92 transitions from the nucleus to the cytoplasm, and associates with translating ribosomes. In the nucleus Pho92 associates with target loci through its interaction with transcriptional elongator Paf1C. Functionally, we show that Pho92 promotes and links protein synthesis to mRNA decay. As such, the Pho92-mediated m6A-mRNA decay is contingent on active translation and the CCR4-NOT complex. We propose that the m6A reader Pho92 is loaded co-transcriptionally to facilitate protein synthesis and subsequent decay of m6A modified transcripts, and thereby promotes meiosis.</p></abstract><kwd-group kwd-group-type="author-keywords"><kwd>m6A</kwd><kwd>RNA

Molecular mechanisms of transcription, RNA processing and translation ensure precise temporal expression of genes. Over the last decade, it has become evident that the fate of cells is also largely determined through RNA modifications (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib81">Roundtree et al., 2017</xref>). Specifically, the <italic>N6</italic>-methyladenosine (m6A) modification on messenger RNAs (mRNAs) has been shown to play a pivotal role in cell differentiation, development, and disease pathology (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib108">Yang et al., 2020</xref>).</p><p>In mammals, the machinery that deposits m6A, also known as the m6A writer complex, consists of the catalytic subunit METTL3 and the catalytically inactive METTL14. Together they form the RNA binding groove, and are bound by WTAP and several other interacting proteins required to lay down the m6A mark on mRNAs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib62">Liu et al., 2014</xref>). The m6A writer complex has strong preference for certain motifs (e.g. RRACH in mammals, and RGAC in yeast), and deposits m6A predominantly at the 3’end of transcripts (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Dominissini et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib70">Meyer et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib83">Schwartz et al., 2013</xref>). Furthermore, the m6A mark is recognized and bound by reader proteins, which in turn recruit other protein complexes to control the fate of m6A marked transcripts (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib109">Zaccara et al., 2019</xref>). The YT521-B Homology (YTH) domain facilitates the m6A interaction of most m6A reader proteins, which defines the YTH family of proteins that is conserved from yeast to humans including plants (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib73">Patil et al., 2018</xref>). YTH domain containing proteins execute various mRNA fate functions, which includes mRNA decay, translation, transcription, and chromatin regulation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib98">Wang et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib112">Zhou et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib106">Xiao et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib55">Lasman et al., 2020</xref>). Interestingly, YTH family proteins have been implicated both in translation and decay, suggesting that these proteins may exert overlapping roles in regulating gene expression (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib98">Wang et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib99">Wang et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib55">Lasman et al., 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib110">Zaccara and Jaffrey, 2020</xref>).</p><p>In yeast, the m6A modification occurs during early meiosis, as part of a critical developmental program known as sporulation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib85">Shah and Clancy, 1992</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Clancy et al., 2002</xref>). During sporulation, diploid cells undergo a single round of DNA replication followed by two consecutive nuclear meiotic divisions to produce four haploid spores (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1A</xref>). Specifically, the m6A modification occurs during early meiosis (meiotic entry, DNA replication, prophase), and declines once cells undergo meiotic divisions (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib83">Schwartz et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1A</xref>). The deposition of m6A on mRNAs is catalysed by the methyltransferase Ime4, the Mettl3 orthologue. Ime4 also requires Mum2, the WTAP orthologue, and Slz1, which together comprise the m6A writer machinery in yeast called the MIS complex (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Agarwala et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1A</xref>).

By employing proteomics and individual-nucleotide resolution UV cross-linking and immunoprecipitation (iCLIP) analysis we reveal that Pho92/Mrb1 binds at 3’ ends of mRNAs in both an m6A dependent and independent manner. During early meiosis, Pho92 localizes to the nucleus, through its interaction with the RNA Polymerase II associated transcription elongation complex, Paf1C, and transitions to the cytoplasm to associate with actively translating ribosomes. The Pho92 deletion mutant displays decreased decay of m6A modified mRNAs as well as defects in protein synthesis.

The known m6A reader and YTH domain containing protein Pho92/Mrb1 was specifically enriched during EM, while Gis2 was enriched in both PM and EM lysates (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1C</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1B</xref>, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="supp4">Supplementary file 4</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib83">Schwartz et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib107">Xu et al., 2015</xref>). Gis2 is an RNA binding protein that associates with ribosomes to facilitate translation by interacting with translation initiation factors (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib79">Rojas et al., 2012</xref>). To validate whether Gis2 preferentially binds to m6A in vitro, we used recombinant proteins and performed RNA binding assays. Gis2 displayed no binding to either modified or unmodified oligos in a repeating DRACH motif sequence context, though Gis2 binding was detected with a control RNA oligo harbouring its known binding motif of GA(A/U) repeats (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1C and D</xref>). However, consistent with other reports (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib83">Schwartz et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib107">Xu et al., 2015</xref>), Pho92 associated with the m6A modified RNA oligo, but not with the unmodified control RNA oligo (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1C</xref>). As expected, Pho92 protein lacking the YTH domain (YTHΔ) completely abrogated binding to the m6A modified oligo, whilst removal of the amino-terminus (NΔ), which is largely unstructured, had no impact on m6A modified oligo binding (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1E</xref>).</p><p>Given that Pho92 was enriched only in early meiosis in the RNA pulldown, we assessed the expression of Pho92 protein and mRNA in wild-type cells entering meiosis. In line with proteomic analysis, we found that Pho92 was expressed in early meiosis prior to when meiotic divisions took place (MI + MII) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1D</xref>). We examined whether the promoter of <italic>PHO92</italic> is possibly under direct control of Ume6, the DNA binding transcription factor that interacts with Ime1 to activate early meiosis gene transcription (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib88">Steber and Esposito, 1995</xref>). We found that the <italic>PHO92</italic> promoter harbours a canonical Ume6 binding site (CGGCGGCTA) 230 nucleotides (nt) upstream of the start codon, which displays strong binding of Ume6 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Chia et al., 2021</xref>; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1E</xref>). To assess whether indeed Pho92 was dependent on Ime1, we induced <italic>IME1</italic> from the <italic>CUP1</italic> promoter (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1B</xref>). Prior to <italic>pCUP1-IME1</italic> induction Pho92 was not detectable, but Pho92 transcript and protein rapidly accumulated after <italic>IME1</italic> induction (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1F</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1F</xref>). Thus, Pho92 is expressed in early meiosis owing to its promoter being regulated by the meiosis-specific transcription factor Ime1 and its interacting partner Ume6.</p></sec><sec id="s2-2"><title>Pho92 associates with mRNAs in an m6A-dependent and independent manner</title><p>We next set out to determine the transcripts that Pho92 and Gis2 bind in vivo, their sequence and positional preferences, and to address whether this interaction is mediated by m6A. Specifically, we used a recently improved iCLIP protocol (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib57">Lee et al., 2021</xref>) to map Pho92 and Gis2 RNA binding sites during early meiosis (4 h SPO). Gis2 crosslinked well to RNA with UV irradiation at 254 nm, whereas Pho92 elicited better crosslinking to RNA with UV irradiation at 365 nm in the presence of uracil analog, 4-thiouracil (4TU-iCLIP, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1G, H</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1H</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib56">Lee and Ule, 2018</xref>).

Therefore, we performed iCLIP in both wild-type and <italic>ime4</italic>Δ cells, to distinguish between Ime4-dependent and independent binding. To further assess whether the Ime4-dependent binding equates to specific binding of the reader protein to m6A sites, we performed m6A individual-nucleotide-resolution cross-linking and immunoprecipitation (miCLIP) under the same growth conditions (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib61">Linder et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib57">Lee et al., 2021</xref>). By using our <italic>ime4</italic>Δ control, we were able to distinguish bona fide m6A peaks from non-specific antibody binding. To control for changes in RNA abundance between wild-type and <italic>ime4</italic>Δ conditions, we also produced matched input libraries from mRNAs used for the miCLIP experiments, which also matched the timepoint used for the iCLIP experiments (4 h SPO).</p><p>Due to the high proportion of cDNAs truncating at the peptide that is crosslinked to RNA fragments, we used the start positions of uniquely mapping reads to assign the positions of crosslink sites in iCLIP, and m6A sites in miCLIP (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib56">Lee and Ule, 2018</xref>). iCLIP and miCLIP replicate samples were highly reproducible at the level of counts per peak, clustering together in principle component analysis (PCA), with the greatest variance being due to the cells’ genetic background (wild type (WT) or <italic>ime4</italic>Δ) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1G</xref>). However, it is notable that the proportion of variance accounted for by genetic background was much less for Gis2 (34%) than for the miCLIP (80%) or Pho92 (58%). For example, the <italic>BDF2</italic> transcript harboured several Pho92 binding sites that depended on Ime4, while Gis2 displayed m6A-independent binding (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1I</xref>).</p><p>To identify m6A sites, we filtered for miCLIP peaks that were significantly reduced in <italic>ime4</italic>Δ compared to wild-type cells (log2FoldChange &lt;= –1, adjusted p-value &lt;0.001), and found 1286 m6A sites in 870 genes (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1J</xref>). A larger number of Pho92 peaks (642 peaks in 507 genes, 16.7% of all detected peaks) were found to be reliably reduced in <italic>ime4</italic>Δ (log2FoldChange &lt;= –2, adjusted p-value &lt;0.001) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1K</xref>). Using a less stringent criteria, we could designate up to 30% (1130/3823 peaks at log2FoldChange ≤ 0, adjusted p-value &lt;0.05) of detected Pho92 peaks as reduced in <italic>ime4</italic>Δ; however, for subsequent analysis, we will refer to the 642 stringently defined peaks as ‘Ime4-dependent’ Pho92 binding sites. This means that surprisingly, a large subset of Pho92 binding sites do not decrease in <italic>ime4</italic>Δ cells, indicating that Pho92 can also associate with transcripts in an Ime4-independent manner (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1K</xref>). We ascertained that this is likely not background binding of Pho92 because in <italic>ime4</italic>Δcells clear enrichment for Pho92-RNA complexes can be detected compared to the untagged control (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1H</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1H</xref>). Indeed, iCLIP of the untagged control had overall much less signal compared to the Pho92 iCLIP (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1I</xref>).</p><p>We assessed whether Ime4-dependent Pho92 and Gis2 binding was also m6A-dependent. First, we calculated the distance to the nearest m6A site from each Ime4-dependent Pho92 binding site. To do so, we validated our miCLIP data against published datasets containing analyses of multiple time points during meiosis using different m6A-sequencing techniques (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib83">Schwartz et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">Garcia-Campos et al., 2019</xref>). Even though the time point of our miCLIP and the published datasets were not a match, m6A sites defined by miCLIP overlapped with m6A sites from the published datasets with ~30% of miCLIP m6A sites being within 50nt of a published site (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s2">Figure 1—figure supplement 2A, B</xref>). We noticed that m6A modified transcripts detected by miCLIP showed an higher expression levels compared to m6A transcripts identified in the published dataset, which could explain the difference overlap between the two datasets (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s2">Figure 1—figure supplement 2C</xref>). The Ime4-dependent Pho92 sites mapped close to m6A sites as determined by miCLIP or published data (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s2">Figure 1—figure supplement 2D, E</xref>). Additionally, Ime4 dependent Pho92 association signal was highly enriched at the m6A sites we identified using miCLIP (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1L</xref>). We conclude that a substantial portion of Pho92 binding is dependent on m6A.</p><p>In contrast, analysis of Gis2 iCLIP revealed 3563 peaks, of which only 43 peaks in 24 genes were decreased in <italic>ime4</italic>Δ representing only 1.2% of all Gis2 peaks (log2FoldChange &lt;= –2, adjusted p-value &lt;0.001) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s2">Figure 1—figure supplement 2F</xref>). However, the few Ime4-dependent Gis2 binding events showed no clear proximity to m6A sites (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s2">Figure 1—figure supplement 2G, H</xref>). Taken together, our data demonstrate that Pho92 is an m6A reader protein in early yeast meiosis.

Strikingly, the highest ranked motif found in Ime4-dependent Pho92 binding sites was nearly identical to the highest ranked motif found for the m6A sites, which highlights again that the Ime4-dependent sites are mostly m6A-dependent sites (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2D</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s1">Figure 2—figure supplement 1B, C</xref>). This motif is an ‘extended’ RGAC sequence context, containing upstream AN and downstream NNU nucleotides that were previously described in <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib83">Schwartz et al., 2013</xref>. The Ime4-independent binding sites of Pho92 showed no enrichment for the m6A motif sequence but showed weak enrichment for short motif sequences containing GU dinucleotides, indicating that m6A-independent binding of Pho92 is conceivably driven independent of sequence context (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1H</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s1">Figure 2—figure supplement 1B, C</xref>).</p><p>As previously stated, consistent with the m6A pattern at mRNAs, Pho92 binding was detected predominantly at the 3’ end of transcripts, with 23% (145/642) of Ime4-dependent binding sites and 13% (410/3171) of Ime4-independent binding sites directly overlapping a STOP codon (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2E</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s1">Figure 2—figure supplement 1D</xref>). We also found Pho92 binding sites in the protein coding sequence or at the 5’ end of transcripts, which included key meiotic mRNAs (<italic>IME1</italic> and <italic>RIM4</italic>) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2A</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s1">Figure 2—figure supplement 1D</xref>). Although most transcripts contained just one m6A and/or a Pho92 binding site, some transcripts did contain two or more m6A and/or Pho92 binding sites (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2F and G</xref>). The 3’ end binding of Pho92 is at least partially independent of m6A and the m6A consensus sequence motif (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2E, H</xref>). The Ime4-independent binding sites also showed positional enrichment at the 3’ end of mRNA transcripts, suggesting that these are likely bona fide binding sites (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2E</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s1">Figure 2—figure supplement 1D</xref>). Thus, Pho92 associates with transcripts predominantly at their 3’ ends, and a subset of this binding occurs in an Ime4-dependent manner at m6A sites within canonical m6A motifs.</p><p>We performed gene ontology (GO) analysis of Pho92-bound transcripts (Ime4- dependent) and found that MAPK signalling, cell cycle and meiosis were the top enriched terms (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2I</xref>). Notably, examination of m6A sites showed enrichment for MAPK signalling and cell cycle but not meiosis (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2I</xref>), suggesting that m6A by itself regulates a different subset of transcripts than Pho92.

GO-analysis of Pho92 bound transcripts revealed that Pho92 associates with genes important for meiosis. This posed the question whether Pho92 acts at the same genes as Ime1 and Ndt80, or perhaps regulates a different category of genes, independent of these two transcription factors. To identify Ime1 and Ndt80 regulated genes we performed RNA-seq in <italic>ime1</italic>Δ and <italic>ndt80</italic>Δ cells in early meiosis (4 hours in SPO). As expected, the genes downregulated in <italic>ndt80</italic>Δ showed strong enrichment for the Ndt80 motif sequence, indicating the RNA-seq was able to identify direct target genes (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s1">Figure 3—figure supplement 1A and B</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">de Boer and Hughes, 2012</xref>). The promoter of transcripts downregulated in <italic>ime1</italic>Δ, however, showed enrichment for both Ndt80 and Ume6 motifs, likely because <italic>ime1</italic>Δ blocks induction of genes indirectly regulated by Ime1 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s1">Figure 3—figure supplement 1A</xref>). We compared the genes that were significantly downregulated in <italic>ime1</italic>Δ and <italic>ndt80</italic>Δcells to Pho92-bound transcripts. While the promoters of Pho92 bound transcripts (iCLIP) were enriched for the Ume6 motif, we found that only 81 genes out of the 507 Pho92 targets overlapped with the 1133 Ime1 regulated transcripts (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3A</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s1">Figure 3—figure supplement 1A</xref>). Moreover, 54 genes overlapped with the 695 Ndt80 regulated transcripts (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3A</xref>). Thus, a large fraction of transcripts bound by Pho92 were likely not targets of Ime1 or Ndt80. Similarly, little overlap was observed between m6A-marked transcripts and transcripts regulated by Ime1 or Ndt80 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s1">Figure 3—figure supplement 1C</xref>).

Approximately 50% of <italic>pho92</italic>Δcells completed one meiotic division after 8 hr of Ime1/Ndt80 induction (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3D</xref>). Thus, the delay in meiosis in <italic>pho92</italic>Δcells was not dependent on the expression of Ime1 and Ndt80.</p><p>One plausible explanation for the delay in meiotic divisions in <italic>pho92</italic>Δcells is that Pho92 contributes to respiratory growth.

We found that Leo1, and to a lesser extent Paf1, co-immunoprecipitated with Pho92, but not the negative control hexokinase 1 protein (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4B</xref>). Additionally, we affinity purified Pho92 fused to GST from <italic>E. coli</italic> and determined whether yeast extracts with HA-tagged Paf1, Leo1 or Ctr9 associated with recombinant GST-Pho92. We found that Paf1C subunits (Paf1, Leo1, and Ctr9) were enriched in the GST-Pho92 pull-down compared to the GST only or GST-Gis2 negative control, while the transcription factor Rap1 did not show enrichment (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4C</xref>). We conclude that Pho92 interacts with Paf1C in vitro and in vivo.</p><p>Paf1C associates with pol II to promote transcription elongation and chromatin organization during transcription (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib80">Rondón et al., 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib94">Van Oss et al., 2017</xref>). If Pho92 and Paf1C interact during meiosis, we hypothesized that Pho92 must localize to the nucleus and possibly associate with gene bodies during transcription. To address this, we first determined whether the Paf1C regulates Pho92 localization in cells entering meiosis. To visualize Pho92 we tagged the protein with mNeongreen (Pho92-mNG) and monitored Pho92-mNG localization during a synchronized meiosis (<italic>pCUP-IME1</italic>) and in wild type cells. We determined nuclear Pho92 signal using histone H2B fused to mCherry (H2B-mCh) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4D</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s2">Figure 4—figure supplement 2A–C</xref>). A large fraction of Pho92-mNG signal was in the nucleus prior to induction of meiosis (0 hr and 2 hr) and in the early time points of meiosis (3 and 4 hr) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4D and E</xref> (see WT)). At the later time points (5 and 6 hr), Pho92-mNG was however, largely excluded from the nucleus (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4D and E</xref> (see control)). It is noteworthy that the Pho92-mNG whole cell signal was lower prior to induction of meiosis (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s2">Figure 4—figure supplement 2D–2F</xref>). A similar Pho92 localization and expression pattern was observed in cells WT for <italic>IME1</italic> (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s2">Figure 4—figure supplement 2A–2B</xref>). We conclude that Pho92 localization is dynamically regulated in cells undergoing early meiosis.</p><p>Next, we examined whether Paf1C contributed to Pho92 localization to the nucleus. We visualized Pho92-mNG localization in <italic>leo1</italic>Δcells and in Paf1 depleted cells using the auxin induced degron (<italic>PAF1-AID</italic>) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s1">Figure 4—figure supplement 1G</xref>). From 3 hr into sporulation onwards, we found that Pho92 was less nuclear in <italic>leo1</italic>Δcells compared to the control (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4D and E</xref>). A comparable difference in nuclear localization of Pho92 was observed when we depleted Paf1 (<italic>PAF1-AID</italic>+IAA) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4F</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s2">Figure 4—figure supplement 2G</xref>). We also examined whether Pho92 localization was dependent on the m6A writer Ime4. In <italic>ime4</italic>Δcells Pho92 was retained more in the nucleus, indicating that m6A modified transcripts normally facilitate its exit from the nucleus (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4G</xref>). We conclude that Pho92 localization is regulated throughout early meiosis. While Paf1C contributes to localization of Pho92 to the nucleus, m6A-modified transcripts facilitate transition of their reader Pho92 into the cytoplasm.</p></sec><sec id="s2-6"><title>Paf1C directs Pho92 to target genes</title><p>Interaction between Leo1 and nascent mRNA has been reported to stabilize the association of Paf1C with transcribed genes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Dermody and Buratowski, 2010</xref>). Our data showing the effect of Paf1C on Pho92 localization to the nucleus raised the question of whether Pho92 is recruited to pre-mRNAs during transcription via Paf1C. To corroborate this idea that Pho92 associates with nascent mRNAs, we scanned the iCLIP data for Pho92 association with intron regions which are typically retained in nascent mRNAs. We found 55 transcripts with Pho92 iCLIP signal in the intronic regions. For example, <italic>BMH2</italic> and <italic>DMC1</italic> intron regions contained Pho92 iCLIP crosslinks, while miCLIP and input displayed no detectable crosslinking within the intron sequence (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4H</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s3">Figure 4—figure supplement 3A</xref>).</p><p>To substantiate the observation that Pho92 associates with some of its targets during transcription, we performed Pho92 chromatin immunoprecipitation (ChIP) qPCR across two genes that contained Ime4-dependent Pho92 binding sites (<italic>BDF2</italic> and <italic>GUT2</italic>) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1I</xref> and Figure 6I). In wild-type cells prior to entering meiosis (0 hr SPO), we found some Pho92 enrichment at these two ORFs (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4I and J</xref>). The observed enrichment is likely not mediated via RNA because ChIP samples were treated with RNase. Cells entering meiosis (3 hr SPO) showed an increase in Pho92 binding. Importantly, in <italic>leo1</italic>Δcells Pho92 ChIP signal over the whole gene body was reduced (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4I and J</xref>). This decrease cannot be attributed to expression differences because <italic>leo1</italic>Δcells expressed <italic>BFD2</italic>, <italic>GUT2</italic>, and Pho92 to comparable levels as wild-type cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s3">Figure 4—figure supplement 3B and C</xref>). Likewise, <italic>leo1</italic>Δcells entered meiosis with a mild delay (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s3">Figure 4—figure supplement 3D</xref>). Also, the Paf1C deletion or depletion mutants we used for our experiments had little effect on cellular m6A levels (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s3">Figure 4—figure supplement 3E</xref>). Thus, Pho92 associates with target genes in a Paf1C-dependent manner. Our data are consistent with a model where Pho92 is loaded co-transcriptionally to nascently produced mRNAs. However, it is also possible that Pho92 has a regulatory function in the nucleus involving chromatin and transcription as has been reported for other YTH domain containing proteins (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib73">Patil et al., 2018</xref>).</p></sec><sec id="s2-7"><title>Pho92 promotes decay of m6A modified transcripts</title><p>Proteins of the YTHDF family, to which Pho92 belongs, promote mRNA decay but have also been shown to impact translation efficiency (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib98">Wang et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib99">Wang et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib59">Li et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib110">Zaccara and Jaffrey, 2020</xref>).

At 4 hr in SPO, we observed a notable increase in expression for Pho92 bound transcripts that were Ime4-dependent, but not for the Ime4-independent transcripts (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5B</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5s1">Figure 5—figure supplement 1A</xref>). Out of 295 transcripts significantly up-regulated in <italic>pho92</italic>Δ vs WT (4 hours SPO),95 were Pho92 targets as determined by iCLIP (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5s1">Figure 5—figure supplement 1A</xref>). Moreover, transcripts significantly upregulated in <italic>pho92</italic>Δat 4 hours in SPO showed greater binding of Pho92 at 3’ends compared to genes that either did not change in expression or were downregulated (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5C</xref>).

We conclude that Pho92 limits the accumulation of m6A-modified transcripts.</p><p>Measuring the rate of mRNA decay of m6A transcripts is not trivial, foremost because m6A transcripts can be masked by presence of non-m6A transcripts within a pool of RNAs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">Garcia-Campos et al., 2019</xref>). Additionally, measuring mRNA decay in sporulating cells using metabolic labelling approaches (e.g. SLAM-seq) is problematic, due to slow uptake of exogenous labelled nucleotides under these conditions (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">Herzog et al., 2017</xref>). Hence, we decided to measure mRNA decay rates using two different approaches. First, we shut-off the transcription of early meiotic genes by switching to nutrient rich conditions (YPD), exiting cells from meiosis and returning cells to growth (RTG). Subsequently we measured the mRNA half-life (<italic>t<sub>1/2</sub></italic>) in wild-type and <italic>pho92</italic>Δ cells of specific target transcripts (<italic>GUT2</italic>, <italic>HOP1</italic>, <italic>IME1</italic>). Consistent with previous work, we found that <italic>GUT2</italic>, <italic>HOP1</italic> and <italic>IME1</italic> mRNA levels rapidly decreased with estimated mRNA <italic>t<sub>1/2</sub></italic> between 2 and 4 min (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5D</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Chia et al., 2021</xref>). In <italic>pho92</italic>Δ cells, the mRNA <italic>t<sub>1/2</sub></italic> of these transcripts were noticeable longer (approximated 1.6-fold) between 3 and 6 min. Additionally, the <italic>IME2</italic> transcript, which showed no detectable Pho92 binding (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2B</xref>), showed marginal difference in mRNA <italic>t<sub>1/2</sub></italic> (1.2-fold, 3.5 min for WT vs 4.3 min for <italic>pho92</italic>Δ; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5s1">Figure 5—figure supplement 1E</xref>).</p><p>We adopted a second approach to measure decay of m6A-transcripts. We reasoned that if m6A modified transcripts are less stable compared to non-m6A mRNAs, m6A is expected to decay faster after blocking mRNA synthesis. We treated cells with thiolutin to block transcription, and subsequently determined m6A levels by m6A-ELISA or LC-MS in wild-type and <italic>pho92</italic>Δ cells during early meiosis (4 hr SPO) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5E</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5s2">Figure 5—figure supplement 2A</xref>). Overall m6A levels declined after thiolutin treatment, indicating that m6A modified mRNAs are less stable than unmodified mRNAs. In <italic>pho92</italic>Δcells however, m6A levels did not decline after thiolutin treatment (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5E</xref>). Similarly, <italic>PHO92</italic><sup>W177A</sup> mutation, which disrupts Pho92 binding to m6A, also showed no decline of m6A-mRNA levels after thiolutin treatment (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5s2">Figure 5—figure supplement 2B</xref>). Taken together, these data support a role for Pho92 in promoting the decay of m6A modified mRNAs.</p></sec><sec id="s2-8"><title>CCR4-NOT mediates m6A decay</title><p>Pho92 itself has no known enzymatic activity that would drive the decay of transcripts. To identify protein complexes involved in the decay of m6A modified transcripts via Pho92, we depleted or deleted various genes involved in mRNA decay and measured the effect on m6A levels via LC-MS in meiosis (6 hr SPO) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5F and G</xref>). Essential components were depleted using induction of the AID system at 4 hr in SPO and m6A levels were determined at 6 hr SPO (2 hr after depletion). We also compared the LC-MS data with m6A-seq2 data, a technique that relies on multiplexed m6A-immunoprecipitation of barcoded and pooled samples, of the same depletion alleles (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Dierks et al., 2021</xref>). We found that <italic>not3</italic>Δ displayed an increase in m6A levels detected by LC-MS and m6A-seq2 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5G</xref>). Moreover, depletion of Caf40 and Rat1 (<italic>CAF40-AID</italic> and <italic>RAT1-AID</italic>) showed a consistent increase in m6A levels using both LC-MS and m6A-seq2 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5F</xref>). In contrast depletion of Xrn1 (<italic>XRN1-AID</italic>) had the opposite effect and showed reduced m6A levels.

Various reports have shown that YTH reader proteins facilitate recruitment of the CCR4-NOT complex to target RNAs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib43">Kang et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Du et al., 2016</xref>). We determined whether the CCR4-NOT complex had a similar effect on the decay of m6A modified transcripts as Pho92. We blocked transcription in <italic>not3</italic>Δdiploid cells entering meiosis, and measured m6A levels. We found that like Pho92, the decay of m6A-modifed transcripts was reduced in <italic>not3</italic>Δdiploid cells when compared to wild-type cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5H</xref>). Thus, CCR4-NOT facilitates the decay of m6A modified transcripts. Given that CCR4-NOT and Pho92 interact with each other, our data suggest that Pho92 promotes decay of its target transcripts via the CCR4-NOT complex.</p></sec><sec id="s2-9"><title>Pho92 and CCR4-NOT mediated m6A decay requires translation</title><p>Among Pho92 interactors several proteins involved in translation and ribosome biogenesis were identified (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4A</xref>). In addition to the vast literature on the intimate connection between mRNA decay rate and translation elongation, a physical link between CCR4-NOT and ribosomes has also been established, implicating CCR4-NOT complex directly in translation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Buschauer et al., 2020</xref>). This prompted us to examine whether the decay of m6A modified transcripts relied on active translation. In addition to blocking transcription, we also inhibited translation by treating cells with cycloheximide. Blocking transcription and translation alleviated the differences in decay rates between <italic>pho92</italic>Δand wild-type cells, suggesting that the decay of m6A-modified transcripts is certainly dependent on translation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5I</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5s2">Figure 5—figure supplement 2A</xref>). Noteworthily, upon cycloheximide treatment in both <italic>pho92</italic>Δand wild-type cells a small decline in m6A levels was detected.

Similarly, blocking translation and transcription alleviated the differences between <italic>not3</italic>Δand wild type (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5s2">Figure 5—figure supplement 2C</xref>).

The effect was dependent on the presence of Ime4. Taken together, we conclude that Pho92 associates with ribosomes to stimulate mRNA decay and protein synthesis of m6A modified transcripts.</p></sec></sec><sec id="s3" sec-type="discussion"><title>Discussion</title><p>m6A modified transcripts are abundant during early yeast meiosis, yet the function of the m6A mark remains elusive. Here we show that the YTH domain containing protein Pho92/Mrb1 is a developmentally regulated m6A reader in yeast that is critical for the onset of meiosis and fitness of gametes. Importantly, we provide evidence that Pho92 co-transcriptionally associates with mRNAs to direct m6A-modifed transcripts for their translation to decay fate. Our study further shows that Pho92 couples protein synthesis and mRNA decay for m6Amodified transcripts (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7</xref>). Our work in yeast meiosis establishes a possible link between the previously described decay and translation functions of YTH reader proteins and m6A-modified mRNAs.</p><fig id="fig7" position="float"><label>Figure 7.</label><caption><title>Model for role of Pho92 in early meiosis.</title><p>Pho92 and MIS complex (Ime4) expression are induced by Ime1.

Master transcription factor Ime1, which drives the transcription of genes in early meiosis, likely directly regulates <italic>PHO92</italic> transcription. Thus, in yeast the m6A writer and reader machinery (Pho92 and the MIS complex) are specifically induced during early meiosis (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7</xref>). Interestingly, Pho92 also regulates the stability of the <italic>PHO4</italic> transcript in a phosphate-dependent manner, suggesting that Pho92 may also play an additional role outside meiosis when there is no m6A (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib43">Kang et al., 2014</xref>).</p><p>Tight regulation of gene expression is critically important to ensure no cellular resources are wasted during meiosis. With this view, the role of Pho92 in coupling translation efficacy to mRNA decay provides an elegant strategy to facilitate increased protein synthesis and subsequent decay of mRNAs important for meiosis. One other possibility is that Pho92 is important for decay of mitotic transcripts, so that cells can enter gametogenesis, or decay of early meiotic transcripts, so that cells enter the subsequent stages of gametogenesis. If this is the case, one expects to find the m6A modified transcripts to be confined to a defined stage corresponding to either the exit from mitosis or entry into meiotic divisions. However, we observe no enrichment for genes linked to mitosis in the Pho92 iCLIP data, and m6A levels are spread over several stages during early meiosis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib83">Schwartz et al., 2013</xref>). Rather, our data suggests that Pho92 increases the translation efficacy of m6A-modified transcripts during critical stages of the early meiotic program when errors in meiotic chromosome segregation are fatal to the survival of gametes. Indeed, cells lacking Pho92 exhibit a delay in the onset of meiotic divisions and reduced gamete fitness.</p><p>While Pho92 deletion mutants exhibit a delay in meiosis, an Ime4 deletion mutant has more severe phenotype (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3</xref>). Apart from the function that m6A has to mediate the Pho92 interaction, it is plausible that m6A has additional roles. However, it is worth noting that a catalytic dead mutant of Ime4 has a less severe phenotype in meiosis, which lead to the conclusion that Ime4 has noncatalytic function during meiosis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Agarwala et al., 2012</xref>). Therefore, we propose that the implications of the m6A modification is largely manifested through Pho92.</p></sec><sec id="s3-2"><title>Mechanism of co-transcriptional loading of Pho92</title><p>Our data suggests that Pho92 interacts with target transcripts during transcription via transcription elongator Paf1C (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7</xref>). First, we found that Pho92 can interact with Paf1C, and that this interaction is critical for the localisation of Pho92 to the nucleus. Interestingly, the Leo1 subunit of Paf1C is also known to interact with nascent RNA, and thus forms a logical platform to facilitate the interaction between Pho92 and nascent RNA (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Dermody and Buratowski, 2010</xref>). Pho92 binding sites show striking 3’ end enrichment regardless of whether binding is Ime4-independent or at m6A sites, which would suggest that the positioning is not entirely dependent on m6A. Pho92 accumulates at chromatin over the course of gene transcription, in a manner that is dependent on Paf1C. This would suggest that transcription or chromatin factors contribute towards Pho92 positioning on transcripts, which may explain why Ime4-independent Pho92 binding does not need a strong RNA sequence context. A simple mechanism could be that m6A locks Pho92 binding to RNA, which in turn allows the Pho92-mRNAs to be sent to translating ribosomes (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7</xref>). It is likely that without m6A locking Pho92 in place, the protein-RNA interaction is less stable. Another possibility is that Pho92 has a separate regulatory function in the nucleus involving chromatin and transcription as has been reported for other YTH domain containing proteins (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib73">Patil et al., 2018</xref>).</p><p>Transcription and chromatin-mediated loading of RNA binding proteins and m6A machinery to control RNA fates is not only limited to Pho92. The co-transcriptional loading of RNA binding proteins has been reported for other RNA binding proteins to control RNA export (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib86">Shahbabian et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Fischl et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib97">Viphakone et al., 2019</xref>). There is also evidence that the promoter sequences influence the stability of RNA (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib91">Trcek et al., 2011</xref>). With regard to m6A, there is proof that m6A is deposited early in RNA synthesis either co-transcriptionally or via chromatin (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib46">Ke et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">Huang et al., 2019</xref>). YTH proteins can act in the nucleus to facilitate the decay of nuclear m6A-modified transcripts and thereby control chromatin states (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib63">Liu et al., 2020</xref>). In <italic>S. pombe</italic>, the YTH-RNA-binding protein Mmi1 is also reported to be co-transcriptionally recruited to ‘decay-promoting’ introns bearing sequence elements known as ‘determinants of selective removal’ (DSRs), which are enriched in meiotic mRNAs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib48">Kilchert et al., 2015</xref>). Contrary to other known YTH-containing domain proteins including Pho92, Mmi1 is incapable of binding to the m6A consensus motif and the Mmi1 role is in fact reported to be suppression of activation of the meiotic programme during mitotic growth, which is in contrast to Pho92’s role in meiosis in <italic>S. cerevisiae</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Harigaya et al., 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib100">Wang et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib87">Shichino et al., 2018</xref>).</p></sec><sec id="s3-3"><title>The role of Pho92 in the translation to decay fate</title><p>Our analysis of Pho92 shows that the destiny of m6A-marked transcripts in translation and mRNA decay are linked. On one hand, we have experimental evidence showing Pho92 is important for efficient protein production. Deletion of Pho92 leads to a reduction in protein over RNA ratios, suggesting translational efficacy is lowered. Additionally, Pho92-bound transcripts showed increased translation efficiency compared to a control set (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6</xref>). On the other hand, Pho92 stimulates the decay of m6A-modified transcripts. How does Pho92 promote decay as well as protein synthesis of m6A-modified transcripts? While it is not impossible that the translation and decay functions of Pho92 are exerted via distinct mechanisms, the likelihood of these functions being linked is more plausible. Firstly, the decay of m6A marked transcripts bound by Pho92 occurred in a translation dependent manner. Secondly, we found that Pho92 associates with actively translating ribosomes and is directly linked to increased translation efficacy. Thirdly, our analysis of decay mutants revealed that the CCR4-NOT complex facilitates the decay of m6A-marked transcripts (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5</xref>). Specifically, depleting the Not3 and Caf40 subunits resulted in increased m6A levels. CCR4-NOT is the major deadenylase complex in cells, which acts at ribosomes and facilitates co-translational decay (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Collart, 2016</xref>). Though we did not establish a direct interaction between Pho92 and the CCR4-NOT complex in this study, others have shown that Pho92 interacts with the Pop2 subunit of CCR4-NOT (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib43">Kang et al., 2014</xref>).</p><p>During the review of our manuscript, a related manuscript was published with several overlapping findings to our work (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib84">Scutenaire et al., 2022</xref>). In this work, the authors also showed that Pho92 associates with m6A marked mRNAs, promotes progression of meiosis, and stimulates the repression of its target mRNAs. The authors propose that timely repression of specific meiotic mRNAs is key for the transition into meiosis. Based on our more in-depth analysis, we favour a model where Pho92 promotes translation and subsequent decay of meiotic transcripts (see discussion above). In our view is unlikely that the relatively small differences in mRNA decay rates (only a few minutes difference) between wild-type and <italic>pho92</italic>Δcells can directly explain the delay in meiotic progression of a few hours as observed in <italic>pho92</italic>Δcells. How Pho92 directly controls progression into meiosis remains to be further investigated.</p><p>In mammalian cells, YTHDF1 and YTHDF2 have been implicated in translation and decay, respectively (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib99">Wang et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib110">Zaccara and Jaffrey, 2020</xref>). Also YTHDC2 has been assigned both functions in decay and translation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">Hsu et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib51">Kretschmer et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib66">Mao et al., 2019</xref>). Thus, opposite effects have been reported for YTH reader proteins. YTHDF2, the likely orthologue of Pho92, has been shown to be important for oocyte development, where it is important for decay of maternal RNAs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib41">Ivanova et al., 2017</xref>). YTHDF2 associates with CCR4-NOT in mammalian cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Du et al., 2016</xref>). Thus, the link between CCR4-NOT, YTH domain-containing proteins and m6A is likely conserved in yeast and mammalian gametogenesis. Interestingly, the translation function of YTHDF1 has been disputed, and it has been proposed that YTHDF proteins act redundantly to regulate decay (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib110">Zaccara and Jaffrey, 2020</xref>). Contradicting this, a significant enrichment of m6A in yeast ribosomal fractions and increased methylation of the most efficiently translated transcripts in the early stages of meiosis has been reported (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Bodi et al., 2015</xref>). Perhaps, the decay functions of Pho92 and YTHDF1 at ribosomes facilitates translational efficiency and as consequence decay or <italic>vice versa</italic>. The reason that mammalian studies have failed to conclude that decay and translation functions may go hand in hand is perhaps because mammalian studies of YTH proteins have typically focused on cell lines under steady state conditions (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib110">Zaccara and Jaffrey, 2020</xref>). In contrast, yeast meiosis is a dynamic process requiring extremely quick turn over of cell RNA and protein states, which is made possible by tightly coupled RNA decay and translation.</p><p>More and more studies show that an intimate link between translation and decay exists (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib74">Pelechano et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib75">Presnyak et al., 2015</xref>). Slowing down translation elongation has been linked to slowing the decay of transcripts (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Chan et al., 2018</xref>). Perhaps, Pho92 directly promotes translation elongation, which in turn leads to faster decay via the CCR4-NOT complex. As such, there is evidence that CCR4-NOT complex, apart from its direct function in translation coupled decay, monitors translating ribosomes for codon optimality (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Buschauer et al., 2020</xref>). Another intriguing possibility is that m6A and Pho92, together with CCR4-NOT are part of an mRNA quality control mechanism to limit aberrant protein synthesis and protein misfolding, while at the same time increase productive translation. In line with this idea is that YTHDC2 protein facilitates interactions between m6A, ribosomes, and decay factors to control stability and translation of the mRNAs, and together possibly constitutes an mRNA to protein quality control mechanism (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib51">Kretschmer et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib40">Inada, 2020</xref>). How m6A, Pho92 and CCR4-NOT together promote translation and decay and how this is linked to a quality control for mRNAs and aberrant translation remains subject for further investigation.</p><p>YTH reader proteins are conserved from yeast to humans and play critical roles in developmental programs and disease pathogenesis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib73">Patil et al., 2018</xref>). YTHDF1 has been shown to be involved in tumour cells immune evasion, while YTHDF2 promotes tumour cell proliferation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Chen et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">Han et al., 2019</xref>).

The part of the membrane containing the signal was determined from the labelled fraction but the membrane was excised (75–150 kDa) from the non-labelled lane and cut into several pieces. Ten μl proteinase K (Roche, 03115828001) was added in 200 μl PK + SDS (10 mM Tris-HCl, pH 7.4, 100 mM NaCl, 1 mM EDTA, 0.2% SDS) buffer and to the nitrocellulose piece and incubation followed with shaking at 1100 rpm for 60 min at 50 °C.

Cells were subjected to cryogenic lysis by freezer mill grinding under liquid nitrogen (SPEX 6875D Freezer/Mill, standard program: 15 cps for 6 cycles of 2 min grinding and 2 min cooling each). The resultant yeast ‘grindate’ powder was resuspended in equal volume of lysis buffer and left to tumble in the cold for an hour. The cell lysate was initially clarified by a short 5-min centrifugation at 1500 rpm at 4 °C and then further purified by ultra-centrifugation at 45,000 rpm for 1 hr at 4 °C. The clarified lysates were subjected to DNase (2 µl of Turbo DNase per mg protein) and RNase (0.05 units/ mg lysate) treatment for 3 min at 37 °C and then transferred to ice. Dynabeads (Protein G) were washed twice in lysis buffer before incubating 10 µg of V5 antibody (for each IP) with the beads for 1 hr at room temperature. Subsequently, the beads were washed thrice in lysis before adding the lysates to the beads-antibody mix. The immunoprecipitation was carried out overnight at 4 °C and from here onwards the same steps as in the miCLIP methods given above were followed starting with the wash with high-salt buffer and including the library preparation with the only exception that RNA-protein complexes in this case were excised out of the membrane from above the size of the respective protein bands.</p></sec><sec id="s4-12"><title>iCLIP/miCLIP pre-processing</title><p>Reads were demultiplexed using iCount demultiplex, and subsequently trimmed for adapter sequences and also for PHRED score &gt;30 using Trim Galore!

Your article has been reviewed by 3 peer reviewers, and the evaluation has been overseen by a Reviewing Editor and a Senior Editor. The following individual involved in the review of your submission has agreed to reveal their identity: Luke E Berchowitz (Reviewer #1).</p><p>Comments to the Authors:</p><p>We are sorry to say that, after consultation with the reviewers, we have decided to decline the paper in its current form. Nevertheless, we encourage you to resubmit when you have thoroughly addressed the reviewers' comments (see below).</p><p>All three reviewers had positive things to say about parts of the manuscript. However, all three also expressed significant concerns about other parts of the paper. The reviewers agreed that addressing these concerns would make the work publishable in <italic>eLife</italic>. Any revised manuscript will require a re-review.</p><p><italic>Reviewer #1:</italic></p><p>m6A is a pervasive and dynamic internal modification to polyadenylated RNA that is important for numerous physiological and pathological biological processes. However, the function of the m6A modification is often context-dependent and challenging to pin down. In the budding yeast <italic>Saccharomyces cerevisiae</italic>, m6A is exclusive to gametogenesis where it plays a major role in meiotic progression. Because deletion of the lone RNA methyltransferase (IME4) exerts a clear phenotype in an inessential process (i.e. meiosis), <italic>S. cerevisiae</italic> is an ideal organism to investigate m6A biology. Varier et al. set out to identify proteins that bind to m6A (&quot;readers&quot;) in <italic>S. cerevisiae</italic> meiosis and then to understand how the binding of these readers affects the fate of m6A-modified mRNA.</p><p>The authors use an m6A bait/mass spectrometry-based approach to determine that Pho92 binds to m6A-modified transcripts as a potential reader. The interaction between Pho92 and m6A-modified RNA is extensively validated. All the Pho92 CLIP experiments include a powerful control (ime4 deletion). This allows the authors to determine which Pho92-RNA interactions require m6A modification. Because of this control and the observation that Ime4-dependent Pho92 RNA binding sites are highly enriched at m6A (based on miCLIP data), the idea that Pho92 binds, in part, to m6A-modified RNA is properly supported. The next question is key – what is the function of the Pho92-m6A interaction? The authors used a clever experiment to test the idea that Pho92 accelerates the decay of m6A-marked transcripts. They blocked transcription and then measured the decay rate of m6A compared to adenosine (unmodified is my understanding). Strikingly, they found that m6A decays more rapidly than unmodified A in a manner that requires Pho92. In my opinion, this is the key result of the paper because it gives insight into both the function of m6A itself in meiosis and the function of the Pho92-m6A interaction. While these population-based measurements do not explain the fate of every m6A-marked transcript, the trend of increased decay rate is important. In my opinion, the idea that Pho92-mediated decay of m6A-marked RNA requires translation is partially supported by subtle effects on protein/RNA ratios. While this idea may turn out to be correct, the data shown do not constitute a slam dunk.</p><p>My main reservation about the paper (in this form) is based on the circumstance that pho92 mutants exhibit defective respiratory growth. Because respiration is critical for meiosis in yeast, I wonder whether and to what degree the effects the authors observe in the pho92 deletion background (m6A decay, meiotic progression, gamete viability, etc.) are due to problems in respiration rather than m6A reader function. I know I'm not supposed to recommend experiments here, but epistasis analyses would be able to address this concern.</p><p>As I mentioned earlier, this solid paper constitutes a timely and important contribution to understanding the function of m6A and reader proteins. In my opinion, RNA modification papers often get bogged down in lists and dynamics without providing convincing data to address the difficult question of the function of the modification. This paper provides substantial support to the idea that m6A drives the decay of specific transcripts in a manner that requires interaction with an RNA-binding protein. It will be exciting for future studies to determine why it is important for cells to accelerate the decay of these transcripts to promote meiotic progression.</p><p>I enjoyed this paper overall. While I think the ideas put forth in the paper are likely correct, my main concern is the degree to which the observations in the pho92 mutant are due to respiratory defects rather than reader function. I think repeating some of the key experiments in a separate mutant with a similar respiratory defect would be very useful.</p><p>Along the same lines, some epistasis experiments could strengthen the conclusions of the paper. First, as you mentioned, it would be more apt to compare meiotic progression in the pho92 mutant to the ime4 catalytic dead rather than the full deletion. I think it would be useful to analyze meiotic phenotypes in a pho92; ime4 catalytic dead double mutant. This would help answer what proportion of the pho92 meiotic phenotype depends on m6A. If the ime4 cat-dead progression defect is epistatic to the pho92 defect (or vice versa), it would constitute strong support for the conclusions of the paper.</p><p>Similarly, the idea that Pho92-mediated decay of m6A transcripts requires CCR4-NOT would be strengthened by analysis of the pho92; not3 double mutant (Figure 5F, G). The key prediction is that decay of m6A should not be further reduced by pho92 deletion in a not3 mutant.</p><p><italic>Reviewer #2:</italic></p><p>Varier et al. identified Pho92 as an m6A reader protein using differentially labeling followed by mass spec in this manuscript.

However, to this date there is no systematic analysis of CLIP with YTH m6A reader proteins in the presence of absence of m6A (e.g. METTL3 KO or METTL14 KO). Another confounding factor for the analysis is that there are three YTHDF proteins in mammalian cells, and it remains somewhat controversial whether they act redundantly, or each have different functions. Noteworthily, there is evidence that the YTH reader protein YTHDC2 functions in an m6A independent way, suggesting m6A independent binding to RNA is conserved (Li et al. 2022). A systematic analysis is needed to see whether YTHDF proteins can associate with RNA in m6A independent manner across different species.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>• Can the authors comment on why only 30% of m6A sites are consistent with published data sites?</p></disp-quote><p>We thank the reviewer for the comment and were intrigued about this as well. We think there are several reasons why this could be the case. First, the published datasets encompass several timepoints throughout yeast gametogenesis. For our analysis, we only collected data from a single timepoint. Second, there are substantial technical differences between the protocols. For example, we performed a miCLIP (m6A antibody + UV crosslinking), while the published data used m6A IP followed by sequencing or an antibody independent method (MAZTER-seq) (Schwartz et al. 2013; Garcia-Campos et al. 2019). Third, we think that our miCLIP dataset is more enriched for transcripts that are well expressed and is possibly less sensitive for transcripts that are relative lowly expressed. Regarding this point we have now included a figure in the manuscript (Figure 1 —figure supplement 2C) and added the following statement in the manuscript.</p><p>“We noticed that m6A modified transcripts detected by miCLIP showed higher expression levels compared to m6A transcripts identified in the published dataset, which could explain the difference overlap between the two datasets (Figure 1 —figure supplement 2C).”</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>• Can the authors provide the overlap percentage of m6A sites identified using miCLIP and ime4-dependent sites?</p></disp-quote><p>We thank the reviewer for the suggestion. We were not completely sure which comparisons were meant by the reviewer, but we assume that it could be either of the following:</p><p>A comparison of miCLIP identified m6A sites with ime4-dependent sites. To clarify the m6A sites were identified by determining the Ime4-dependent, and thus we used a combination of WT and <italic>ime4</italic>∆ mutant miCLIP experiments. In yeast, Ime4 is essential for all m6A methylation, hence we used the <italic>ime4</italic>∆ mutant for the miCLIP as the negative control. Given that the m6A antibody crosslinks to RNA in a non-specific manner as well as, we used the <italic>ime4</italic>∆ mutant data to identify the Ime4-dependent peaks. Thus, per definition the m6A identified sites are ime4-dependent. We went over the manuscript and clarified this where needed. Below a further detailed explanation:</p><p>In the manuscript we state: “To identify m6A sites, we filtered for miCLIP peaks that were significantly reduced in <italic>ime4</italic>∆ compared to wild-type cells (log2FoldChange &lt;= -1, adjusted p value &lt; 0.001), and found 1286 m6A sites in 870 genes”. It is worth noting that the total number of miCLIP peaks was 9519 in the WT (both Ime4 dependent and independent).”</p><p>Approximately 14% of miCLIP peaks could be assigned as m6A sites because their signal was reduced in <italic>ime4</italic>∆ compared to WT. Another study made comparable observations when using the miCLIP2 technique. In this study more than 500,000 peaks in WT mESCs were identified, and this was narrowed down to 11,707 m6A sites based on Mettl3dependence (Kortel et al. 2021).</p><p>The second option is that reviewer referred to the overlap between m6A sites identified and Pho92 Ime4 dependent sites. This information is provided in Figure 2C. Here in the Venn diagram we see that 281/642 Ime4-dependent Pho92 binding sites overlap with an m6A site as defined by our miCLIP.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>• The author claims that Paf1C contributes to the localization of Pho92 to the nucleus, and m6A modified transcripts facilitate the transition of their reader Pho92 into the cytoplasm. This conclusion is not supported, there are many other possibilities.</p></disp-quote><p>We thank the reviewer for the comment. Our data are consistent with a model that Paf1C directs Pho92 to mRNAs co-transcriptionally. First, Pho92 localization to nucleus is reduced in <italic>leo1</italic>∆ mutant, and Paf1 depletion mutant. Second, Pho92 ChIP signal is enriched at several Pho92 targets in Leo1 dependent manner. We agree that a functional link is lacking in our data. For example, we tried to determine whether Pho92 binding to m6A transcripts was reduced in Paf1C mutants, but this was technically challenging.</p><p>In addition to our model, we have now also discussed other possibilities. For example, it is possible that Pho92 has a second role in nucleus to degrade RNA there, and thereby could regulate chromatin and transcription. A nuclear function has been reported for other YTH proteins. However, our data suggest that m6A modified transcripts are degraded in mostly a translation dependent manner. Another possibility is that Pho92 has an m6A independent role in the nucleus. We agree that more work is needed to dissect this further. Nevertheless, we think it is intriguing that Pho92 is dynamically localized, and that the data are consistent with the model that Pho92 is recruited co-transcriptionally. We added the following section to result section.</p><p>“Our data are consistent with a model where Pho92 is loaded co-transcriptionally to nascently produced mRNAs.

We acknowledge that we have not identified a function for the Paf1C mediated localization of Pho92 to target genes. We have spent quite some time trying to link the Paf1C interaction of Pho92 to function, however this turned out to be technically challenging. We think that the link between Paf1C and Pho92 nuclear localization and Pho92 binding ORFs of target genes suggests that Paf1C can direct Pho92 to target transcript co-transcriptionally. Whether possibly splicing is regulated by Pho92 or other nuclear processes remains to be determined.

In this assay, we did the same and we followed the fate of the m6A mRNAs relative to the fate of all mRNAs. Thus, our method does not deviate much from a standard mRNA decay assay. The reasons for the approach are outlined in the manuscript. One reason is that it is not clear what fraction of target transcripts are m6A modified, which can potentially mask effects on decay. In addition, the thiolutin concentration used will likely not shut down transcription completely, which would prove problematic for measuring absolute mRNA decay rates but not for our relative measurements.</p><p>To address the reviewer’s suggestion, we have performed a complementary approach and determined mRNA half-live measurements of Pho92 target transcripts in wild type and <italic>pho92</italic>∆ cells.
