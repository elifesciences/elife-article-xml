converts sensory stimuli into motor actions, is critical for the brain to initiate behaviors. Although the circuitry involved in sensorimotor transformation has been well delineated, the molecular logic behind this process remains poorly understood. Here, we performed high-throughput and circuit-specific single-cell transcriptomic analyses of neurons in the superior colliculus (SC), a midbrain structure implicated in early sensorimotor transformation. We found that SC neurons in distinct laminae expressed discrete marker genes. Of particular interest, <italic>Cbln2</italic> and <italic>Pitx2</italic> were key markers that define glutamatergic projection neurons in the optic nerve (Op) and intermediate gray (InG) layers, respectively. The Cbln2+ neurons responded to visual stimuli mimicking cruising predators, while the Pitx2+ neurons encoded prey-derived vibrissal tactile cues. By forming distinct input and output connections with other brain areas, these neuronal subtypes independently mediated behaviors of predator avoidance and prey capture. Our results reveal that, in the midbrain, sensorimotor transformation for different behaviors may be performed by separate circuit modules that are molecularly defined by distinct transcriptomic codes.</p></abstract><kwd-group kwd-group-type="author-keywords"><kwd>superior colliculus</kwd><kwd>sensorimotor transformation</kwd><kwd>single-cell transcriptome</kwd><kwd>Cbln2</kwd><kwd>Pitx2</kwd></kwd-group><kwd-group kwd-group-type="research-organism"><title>Research organism</title><kwd>Mouse</kwd></kwd-group><funding-group><award-group id="fund1"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100002855</institution-id><institution>Ministry of Science and Technology of the People's Republic of China</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>2019YFA0110100</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Wang</surname><given-names>Xiaoqun</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund2"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100002855</institution-id><institution>Ministry of Science and Technology of the People's Republic of China</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>2017YFA0102601</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Wu</surname><given-names>Qian</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund8"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100002855</institution-id><institution>Ministry of Science and Technology of the People's Republic of China</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>2017YFA0103303</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Wang</surname><given-names>Xiaoqun</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund3"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100002367</institution-id><institution>Chinese Academy of Sciences</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>XDB32010100</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Wang</surname><given-names>Xiaoqun</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund4"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100001809</institution-id><institution>National Natural Science Foundation of China</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>31925019</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Cao</surname><given-names>Peng</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund5"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100001809</institution-id><institution>National Natural Science Foundation of China</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>31771140</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Wang</surname><given-names>Xiaoqun</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund9"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100001809</institution-id><institution>National Natural Science Foundation of China</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>81891001</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Wang</surname><given-names>Xiaoqun</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund6"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution>BUAA-CCMU Big Data and Precision Medicine Advanced Innovation Center Project</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>BHME-2019001</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Wang</surname><given-names>Xiaoqun</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><funding-statement>The funders had no role in study design, data collection and interpretation, or the decision to submit the work for publication.</funding-statement></funding-group><custom-meta-group><custom-meta specific-use="meta-only"><meta-name>Author impact statement</meta-name><meta-value>Single-cell RNA-sequencing and neural circuitry analyses reveal that sensorimotor transformation of different behaviors which are performed by separate circuit modules in the superior colliculus are molecularly defined by distinct transcriptomic codes of specific neuron subtypes.</meta-value></custom-meta></custom-meta-group></article-meta></front><body><sec id="s1" sec-type="intro"><title>Introduction</title><p>Sensorimotor transformation is a fundamental process in which the brain converts sensory information into motor command (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Crochet et al., 2019</xref>;

Moreover, by combining scRNA-seq with tools for circuit analysis, one should be able to link the transcriptomic heterogeneity to other characteristics of neurons such as their electrophysiological properties (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Földy et al., 2016</xref>), spatial distribution (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Eng et al., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib57">Moffitt et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib66">Shah et al., 2016</xref>), neuronal activity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">Hrvatin et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib49">Liu et al., 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib89">Wu et al., 2017</xref>), and projection specificity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib75">Tasic et al., 2018</xref>). Thus, scRNA-seq may provide an opportunity to explore the molecular and genetic logic of sensorimotor transformation.</p><p>In the mammalian brain, the superior colliculus (SC) is a midbrain structure for early sensorimotor transformation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Basso and May, 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Cang et al., 2018</xref>). The superficial layers of the SC, including the superficial gray (SuG) layer and the optic nerve (Op) layer, are involved in visual information processing (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">De Franceschi and Solomon, 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">Gale and Murphy, 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib79">Wang et al., 2010</xref>). The deep layers of the SC, including the intermediate layer and deep layer, participate in processing of tactile and auditory information (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Cohen et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Dräger and Hubel, 1975</xref>). The deep layers of the SC control eye movement (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib71">Sparks, 1986</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib80">Wang et al., 2015</xref>), head movement (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib41">Isa and Sasaki, 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib87">Wilson et al., 2018</xref>), and locomotion (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Felsen and Mainen, 2008</xref>). From a neuroethological perspective, the sensorimotor transformations that occur in the SC enable it to orchestrate distinct behavioral actions in predator avoidance and prey capture (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Dean et al., 1989</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib58">Oliveira and Yonehara, 2018</xref>). However, how different neuronal subtypes participate in these survival behaviors and the molecular features of these neurons remain unknown.</p><p>In the present study, by performing high-throughput and circuit-specific single-cell transcriptomic analyses of cells in the SC, we systematically studied the molecular markers of SC neurons, sensory response properties, input-output connectivity, and their behavioral relevance. We found that Cbln2+ and Pitx2+ SC neurons form part of two distinct sets of circuit modules for sensorimotor transformation related to behaviors of predator avoidance and prey capture. Our data suggest that sensorimotor transformation for different behaviors may be performed by separate circuit modules that are molecularly defined by distinct transcriptomic codes.</p></sec><sec id="s2" sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><sec id="s2-1"><title>A census of SC cell types using snRNA-seq</title><p>To understand the cell diversity of the SC, snRNA-seq of mouse SC was performed using the 10× Genomics Chromium Platform.

To answer this question, we developed a method of spatial classification of mRNA expression data (SPACED) (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://github.com/xiaoqunwang-lab/SPACED">https://github.com/xiaoqunwang-lab/SPACED</ext-link> [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib83">Wang, 2021a</xref>]; also see the Materials and methods section for details) through which we were able to assign a location score to each neural subset by analyzing RNA in situ hybridization images of the top DEGs in each subset from Allen Brain Atlas (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://mouse.brain-map.org">https://mouse.brain-map.org</ext-link>) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1E–F</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1D</xref>). Using this method, a specificity score and the statistical significance were calculated for each subset, and it was found that the subsets of excitatory neurons and inhibitory neurons exhibited distinctive specificities for different layers of the SC (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1E–G</xref>). Cells of subsets Ex-5/7/8/9 and In-2/7/8/10 were assigned to the SuG matter layer, while cells in the Ex-3/6 and In-3 subsets localized in the Op layer. In addition, Ex-1/4 and In-4 cells exhibited high spatial scores for the intermediate gray and white (InG/InWh) layers (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1E–G</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1D</xref>) (p &lt; 0.05). Although several neural subsets also showed relatively high spatial scores for certain layers, the data for those subsets did not meet the criteria for statistical significance, indicating that some neurons might be located in multiple layers. To determine the reliability of the spatial assignments, we compared the mapping results obtained from SPACED with those from previously published method (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib92">Zeisel et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s2">Figure 1—figure supplement 2A–B</xref>). We extracted excitatory neurons and inhibitory neurons from Zeisel’s work with the assigned regional identities of SC and integrated those cells with SC neurons from this study (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s2">Figure 1—figure supplement 2C–F</xref>). Co-embedding of neuronal subtypes showed identical regional identities, indicating that SPACED produced essentially consistent results with Zeisel’s method. In addition, SPACED methods offered more detailed spatial information of SC neural subtypes (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s2">Figure 1—figure supplement 2D,F</xref>). We next analyzed the gene ontology (GO) enrichment of the DEGs of cells that we assigned to different layers (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1H</xref>). Intriguingly, the GO terms suggest that predicted SuG layer cells may play roles in visual learning and cognition, consistent with previous findings that cells in this layer receive signals from the retina and the visual cortex (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib71">Sparks, 1986</xref>). The GO analysis also indicated that cells that are predicted in the Op layer may be involved in defense and fear responses, while cells that are predicted in the InG layer may play roles in locomotor behavior (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1H</xref>). These data suggest that neurons with diverse and distinctive transcriptomic profiles may be located in different layers of the SC.</p></sec><sec id="s2-2"><title>Electrophysiological properties of LPTN- and ZI-projecting SC neurons</title><p>Several populations of glutamatergic neurons in the SC show distinctive projection patterns (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Dean et al., 1989</xref>).

These data indicate that activation of the Pitx2+ SC-ZI pathway selectively promotes prey capture without inducing predator avoidance.</p></sec></sec><sec id="s3" sec-type="discussion"><title>Discussion</title><p>The SC of the midbrain is a classical model for the study of early sensorimotor transformation related to sensory-triggered innate behaviors (fish [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Bianco and Engert, 2015</xref>]; rodents [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Dean et al., 1989</xref>]; primates [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib71">Sparks, 1986</xref>]). In mice, a series of projection-defined SC circuits have been linked to sensory-triggered innate behaviors such as predator avoidance (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Evans et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib68">Shang et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib67">Shang et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib85">Wei et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib96">Zhou et al., 2019</xref>) and prey capture (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">Hoy et al., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib69">Shang et al., 2019</xref>). However, the number of cell types in the SC, their molecular signatures, their projection patterns, and their functional roles in these behaviors remain unclear. Here, we used a combined approach consisting of single-cell transcriptomic analysis and circuit analysis to address the above questions.</p><p>Using high-throughput single-cell transcriptomic analyses, we first systematically analyzed the cell-type diversity of the SC. We found that the majority of neuronal subtypes defined by gene expression patterns showed layer-specific distribution in the SC (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1</xref>). To better understand the correlation between projection patterns and transcriptomics, we performed projection-specific scRNA-seq of cells in the SC-LPTN and SC-ZI pathways and identified Cbln2 and Pitx2 as key molecular markers for SC neurons with different projections (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2</xref>). Cbln2+ and Pitx2+ SC neurons, distributed in distinct layers of the SC, were functionally involved in predator avoidance and prey capture behavior, respectively (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3</xref>). Strikingly, these two neuronal subtypes processed neuroethological information received through distinct sensory modalities (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4</xref>) and were connected to almost completely different sets of input-output synaptic connectomes (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figures 5</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">6</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">7</xref>). Finally, activation of the Cbln2+ SC-LPTN and the Pitx2+ SC-ZI pathways copied the behavioral phenotypes of SC-LPTN and SC-ZI pathways (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8">Figure 8</xref>).</p><p>We believe our data allow two conclusions. First, they reveal that it is the transcriptomically defined neuronal subtypes and their projections, when combined together, define early sensorimotor transformation and the subsequent behavior. This finding supports the hypothesis that transcriptomically defined circuit modules correspond to specific behaviors. Previous studies of this ‘correspondence’ question in the hypothalamus and prefrontal cortex, two brain areas that are involved in the regulation of motivation and cognition, did not find a clear correspondence between transcriptomically defined neurons and behaviors (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib43">Kim et al., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib50">Lui et al., 2021</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib57">Moffitt et al., 2018</xref>). In combination with these pioneering studies, our results suggest that the circuit design of sensorimotor transformation in the midbrain, which requires precise detection of sensory features and rapid initiation of innate behaviors, may differ from the circuit design in brain areas that are responsible for complex information processing such as that related to the regulation of motivation and cognition.</p><p>Second, our data identified Cbln2 and Pitx2 as discrete markers that label neurons in the Op and InG layers of the SC. Intriguingly, we found three Op subtypes (two subtypes of excitatory neurons; one subtype of inhibitory neurons) and three InG/InWh subtypes (two subtypes of excitatory neurons; one subtype of inhibitory neurons) in our unsupervised high-throughput single-cell transcriptome and spatial information analyses. Cbln2 was extensively expressed by two subtypes of Op layer excitatory neurons, but Pitx2 was expressed by only one subtype of InG layer excitatory neurons, indicating the heterogeneity of neurons located in different SC layers. Our data also suggest that neurons with similar transcriptomic profiles may tend to participate in the same projection paths and to play a role in the regulation of behavior.</p><p>Cbln2 and other members of the Cerebellin family are synaptic organizer molecules that bind to presynaptic neurexins and to postsynaptic receptors (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Cheng et al., 2016</xref>). Recent studies have shown that Cbln2 may participate in synapse formation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib55">Matsuda and Yuzaki, 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib65">Seigneur and Südhof, 2018</xref>). It remains to be determined whether Cbln2 in Cbln2-expressing SC neurons participates in the formation of the SC-LPTN pathway. As a transcription factor, Pitx2 participates in the migration of collicular neurons during brain development (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib78">Waite et al., 2013</xref>). In the adult brain, activation of Pitx2+ SC neurons elicited stereotyped head displacements in a body-referenced frame (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib53">Masullo et al., 2019</xref>). However, the functional role of Pitx2+ SC neurons in naturalistic behavioral context has not been demonstrated in this study. Our study has shown that Pitx2+ SC neurons specifically participate in predatory hunting, a goal-directed behavior that occurs in natural environment.</p><p>An interesting finding of our study is that the brain-wide projectomes of Cbln2+ and Pitx2+ SC neurons are spatially segregated. Although we only examined the functions of Cbln2+ and Pitx2+ SC-LPTN and SC-ZI pathways, we do not rule out the involvement of other pathways in predator avoidance and prey capture behaviors. In addition to the LPTN, the Cbln2+ SC neurons also project to the inferior colliculus (IC), laterodorsal tegmental nucleus (LDTg), and the inferior olive (IO). It is likely that the Cbln2+ SC-IC pathway may be involved in visual-auditory integration during innate fear in complex environment with both visual and auditory stimuli. The Cbln2+ SC-LDTg pathway may participate in the integration of innate fear responses evoked by olfaction and vision, because the interneurons in the LDTg are involved in olfactory-evoked innate fear (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib90">Yang et al., 2016</xref>). In addition to the ZI, the Pitx2+ SC neurons project to the parafascicular nucleus (PF), intermediate reticular nucleus (IRt), and parvicellular reticular nucleus (PCRt). The Pitx2+ SC-PF pathway may be involved in transmitting prey-relevant tactile signals to the dorsal striatum, a major component of the basal ganglia, for coordination of body movements, because the PF is known as a major input to the dorsal striatum (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib52">Mandelbaum et al., 2019</xref>). The Pitx2+ SC-PCRt pathway may be involved in biting actions during predatory attack, as PCRt contains a large population of craniofacial premotor neurons (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib72">Stanek et al., 2014</xref>).</p><p>Our results also raise new questions. First, it is unclear how the genes expressed by Cbln2+ and Pitx2+ SC neurons participate in the formation and function of the Cbln2+ SC-LPTN and Pitx2+ SC-ZI pathways. Single-cell transcriptomic analyses of Cbln2+ and Pitx2+ SC neurons at different developmental stages and genetic manipulations of these neurons may be performed to address this question. Second, the neural substrate that mediates the interactions between the two distinct circuit modules for predator avoidance and prey capture remains to be studied. With the identification of Cbln2+ and Pitx2+ SC neurons, their distinct input-output synaptic connectomes, and the demonstration of their roles in sensory-triggered innate behaviors in hand, these questions can now be addressed.</p></sec><sec id="s4" sec-type="materials|methods"><title>Materials and methods</title><table-wrap id="keyresource" position="anchor"><label>Key resources

Mice were housed in groups (three to five animals per cage) before they were separated 3 days prior to virus injection. After virus injection, each mouse was housed in one cage for 3 weeks before subsequent experiments. To avoid potential sex-specific differences, we used male mice only.</p></sec><sec id="s4-2"><title>Nuclei preparation</title><p>Mice were anesthetized with 3% isoflurane and brains were removed and placed into ice-cold oxygenated artificial cerebrospinal fluid (aCSF). SC were dissected from the midbrain and placed into RNAlater (Invitrogen, AM7021) and stored at 4°C overnight. To ensure the quality of the experiment, two replicates were conducted and five mice were used for each replicate. On the day for the experiment, tissue samples were washed with phosphate buffered saline (PBS) (Gibco, REF 10010–023) and cut into pieces &lt;1 mm and were homogenized using a glass Dounce tissue grinder (Sigma, Cat# D8938) in 2 ml of ice-cold EZ PREP (Sigma, Cat# NUC-101).

Briefly, by using the 10× GemCode Technology, thousands of nuclei were partitioned into nanoliter-scale Gel BeadIn-EMulsions (GEMs). At this step, all the cDNA produced from the same nuclei were labeled by a common 10× Barcode. Primers containing an Illumina R1 sequence (read1 sequencing primer), a 16 bp 10× Barcode, a 10 bp randomer and a poly-dT primer sequence were released and mixed with nuclei lysate and Master Mix upon dissolution of the single-cell 3′ gel bead in a GEM. The GEMs were incubated to generate barcoded, full-length cDNA from poly-adenylated mRNA by reverse transcription. After breaking the GEMs, silane magnetic beads were used to remove the leftover biochemical reagents and primers. Before constructing the library, the cDNA amplicon size was optimized by enzymatic fragmentation and size selection. During the end repair and adaptor ligation step, P5, P7, a sample index and R2 (read two primer sequence) were added to each selected cDNA. P5 and P7 primers were used in Illumina bridge amplification of the cDNA (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://10xgenomics.com">http://10xgenomics.com</ext-link>).

To detect potential doublets, we performed the scrublet (version 0.2.1) pipeline on each sample with parameters (expected_doublet_score=0.06, sim_doublet_ratio=20, min_gene_variability_pctl=85 and n_prin_comps=30) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib88">Wolock et al., 2019</xref>). 1708/17979 cells with computed doublet score greater than 0.16 were identified as doublets and excluded from subsequent analysis. Next, a series of quality control analyses were performed. Cells with nGenes (number of detected genes) below 800 or above 6000 were discarded. Cells with nUMI (number of unique molecular identifier) above 20,000 or percentage of mitochondrial genes greater than 3% were removed. Genes that did not show expression in at least three cells were excluded. After quality control, 14,892 cells and 23,076 genes were kept for downstream analysis.</p><p>The downstream analysis of 10× snRNA-seq data was performed with R package Seurat (3.1.0) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Butler et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib73">Stuart et al., 2019</xref>). Briefly, a Seurat object was created with the filtered read counts. The log-transformation was then performed with the function NormalizeData. Next, 2000 variable genes were identified with function FindVariableGenes and passed to function RunPCA for the principal component analysis (PCA). Then, batch effect correction was performed using function fastMNN <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">Haghverdi et al., 2018</xref> followed by dimension reduction with t-distributed stochastic neighbor embedding (t-SNE) approach using function RunTSNE.

Briefly, the DEGs of excitatory neuron and inhibitory neuron subtypes were firstly computed. To access genes whose expression pattern is more subtype restricted, we computed subtype specificity score for each gene based on Jensen-Shannon divergence, inspired by Cusanovich’s study (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Cusanovich et al., 2018</xref>) and ranked the DEGs by their subtype specificity score. Then, for each neuron subtype, the top 10 most subtype specific genes were selected as reference for spatial classification, as SPACED exhibited higher sensitivity with 10 genes (detailed information could be found at the Github repository for SPACED; <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://github.com/xiaoqunwang-lab/SPACED">https://github.com/xiaoqunwang-lab/SPACED</ext-link>). The in situ slices of the selected genes used for spatial classification were downloaded from Allen Mouse Brain Atlas (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://mouse.brain-map.org/search/index">https://mouse.brain-map.org/search/index</ext-link>). After that, the color type of these slices was transformed into 8-bit using ImageJ (v1.48h3). The signal pixels of each slice were converted into red by performing ‘Image&gt;Adjust&gt;Threshold’ in ImageJ. Subsequently, the four layers of the SC, named as SuG layer, Op layer, InG layer/InWh layer, and DpG layer were selected using ROI manager. In each slice, a region with the weakest signal was selected as the background. The signal intensity of the four layers was calculated respectively. Briefly, the area fraction (definition from ImageJ: The percentage of pixels in the image or selection that have been highlighted in red using Image&gt;Adjust&gt;Threshold. For non-thresholded images, the percentage of non-zero pixels.) of each of the five ROIs in each slice was firstly calculated. The signal intensity was then carried out by subtracting the area fraction of the background ROI (ROI with the weakest signal) from that of the other four ROIs (SuG, Op, InG/InWh, and DpG). Afterward, the computed in situ signal intensities of each gene for the four SC layers were normalized into range 0 and 1. We then computed a log-transformation of the mean of signal intensity for each layer across the selected genes as the layer specificity score for the corresponding layer. To access the spatial distribution priority of each subtype, ANOVA and post hoc test were performed on the processed signal intensities and p-value &lt; 0.05 was considered as statistically significant.

With the videos taken by the two horizontal cameras, predatory attacks with jaw were visually identified by replaying the video frame by frame (50 frames/s). We marked the predatory jaw attacks with yellow vertical lines in the behavioral ethogram of predatory hunting. With this method, we measured three parameters of predatory hunting: time to capture, latency to attack, and attack frequency. Time to capture was defined as the time between the introduction of prey and the last jaw attack.

Three weeks after AAV injection, fiber photometry was used to record GCaMP signals from the Cbln2+ SC neurons or Pitx2+ SC neurons of head-fixed mice standing on a treadmill in response to visual and vibrissal somatosensory stimuli (see below). A flashing LED triggered by a 1 s square-wave pulse was simultaneously recorded to synchronize the video and GCaMP signals. After the experiments, the optical fiber tip sites in the SC were histologically examined in each mouse.</p></sec><sec id="s4-23"><title>Visual stimulation</title><p>The test mice were head-fixed and standing on top of a cylindrical treadmill (Nanjing Thinktech Inc) for fiber photometry recording of SC neurons in response to visual stimuli. The contralateral eye was kept open, and the ipsilateral eye was covered to prevent viewing. A 45 cm wide and 35 cm high screen was placed 18 cm from the contralateral eye and 25° to the mid-sagittal plane of the mouse, resulting in a visually stimulated area (100° horizontal × 90° vertical) in the lateral visual field. The orientation of the screen was adjusted ~45° to make the screen perpendicular to the eye axis of the contralateral eye. After identification of the RF location on the screen of SC neurons, a computer-generated black circle (diameter = 5° or 25°) moving across the visual RF in eight direction at different speed (32°/s or 128°/s) was presented. The luminance of the black circle and gray background was 0.1 and 6.6 cd/m<sup>2</sup>, respectively. The black circle first appeared stationary outside the RF for 2 s to collect baseline calcium signals as controls, and was then presented with an interval of at least 15 s between trials to allow the neurons to recover from any motion adaptation.</p></sec><sec id="s4-24"><title>Vibrissal air puff stimulation</title><p>To mimic the somatosensory cues of moving prey, brief air puffs (50 ms) with different strengths (15 or 30 psi) were delivered through a metal tube (diameter 1.5 mm) connected with Picospritzer III. The output of Picospritzer III was controlled by a programmable pulse generator. When delivering air puffs as vibrissal somatosensory stimuli, the tube was oriented from temporal to nasal side of mouse. The distance between the tube nozzle and the whiskers was ~30 mm. When presenting repetitive air puff stimuli, the frequency was either 0.5 or 2 Hz. For each mouse, 10–15 trials were repeatedly presented to the whiskers, so that an average response was obtained.</p></sec><sec id="s4-25"><title>Cell-type-specific anterograde tracing</title><p>For cell-type-specific anterograde tracing of Cbln2+ and Pitx2+ SC neurons, AAV-DIO-EGFP (200 nl) was stereotaxically injected into the SC of Cbln2-IRES-Cre and Pitx2-Cre mice, respectively. The mice were then maintained in a cage individually. Three weeks after viral injection, mice were perfused with saline followed by 4% PFA in PBS. After 8 hr of post-fixation in 4% PFA, coronal or sagittal brain sections at 40 μm in thickness were prepared using a cryostat (Leica CM1900). All coronal sections were collected and stained with primary antibody against EGFP and DAPI. The coronal brain sections were imaged with an Olympus VS120 epifluorescence microscope (10× objective lens).</p></sec><sec id="s4-26"><title>Cell-type-specific RV tracing</title><p>The modified RV-based three-virus system was used for mapping the whole-brain inputs to vGAT+ AHN neurons (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib86">Wickersham et al., 2007</xref>). All the viruses included AAV2/9-CAG-DIO-EGFP-2A-TVA (5 × 10<sup>12</sup> viral particles/ml), AAV2/9-CAG-DIO-RG (5 × 10<sup>12</sup> viral particles/ml), and EnvA-pseudotyped, glycoprotein (RG)-deleted and DsRed-expressing RV (RV-EvnA-DsRed, RV) (5.0 × 10<sup>8</sup> viral particles/ml), which were packaged and provided by BrainVTA Inc (Wuhan, China). A mixture of AAV2/9-CAG-DIO-EGFP-2A-TVA and AAV2/9-CAG-DIO-RG (1:1, 200 nl) was stereotaxically injected into the SC of Cbln2-IRES-Cre or Pitx2-Cre mice unilaterally. Two weeks after AAV helper injection, RV-EvnA-DsRed (300 nl) was injected into the same location in the SC of Cbln2-IRES-Cre or Pitx2-Cre mice in a biosafety level-2 lab facility. Starter neurons were characterized by the coexpression of DsRed and EGFP, which were restricted in the SC.</p><p>One week after injection of RV, mice were perfused with saline followed by 4% PFA in PBS. After 8 hr of post-fixation in 4% PFA, coronal brain sections at 40 μm in thickness were prepared using a cryostat (Leica CM1950). All coronal sections were collected and stained with DAPI. The coronal brain sections were imaged with an Olympus VS120 epifluorescence microscope (10× objective lens) and analyzed with ImageJ. For quantifications of subregions, boundaries were based on the Allen Institute’s reference atlas. We selectively analyzed the retrogradely labeled dense areas. The fractional distribution of total cells labeled by RV was measured.</p></sec><sec id="s4-27"><title>Cell-counting strategies</title><p>Cell-counting strategies are summarized in <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="supp7">Supplementary file 7</xref>. For counting cells in the SC, we collected coronal sections (40 μm) from bregma −3.08 mm to bregma −4.60 mm for each mouse. We acquired confocal images (20× objective, Zeiss LSM 780) followed by cell counting with ImageJ software. By combining fluorescent in situ hybridization and immunohistochemistry, we counted the number of Cbln2+ and Pitx2+ cells in the SC and calculated the percentages of Cbln2+ and Pitx2+ neurons in the neuronal population labeled by EGFP. To analyze monosynaptic inputs of Cbln2+ SC neurons, we counted DsRed+ cells in a series of brain areas. For the detailed information on the brain regions and cell counting strategy, see <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="supp7">Supplementary file 7</xref>. We acquired fluorescent images (10× objective, Olympus) followed by cell counting with ImageJ software.</p></sec><sec id="s4-28"><title>Slice physiological recording</title><p>Slice physiological recording was performed according to the published work (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib48">Liu et al., 2017</xref>). Brain slices containing the SC were prepared from adult mice anesthetized with isoflurane before decapitation. Brains were rapidly removed and placed in ice-cold oxygenated (95% O<sub>2</sub> and 5% CO<sub>2</sub>) cutting solution (228 mM sucrose, 11 mM glucose, 26 mM NaHCO<sub>3</sub>, 1 mM NaH<sub>2</sub>PO<sub>4</sub>, 2.5 mM KCl, 7 mM MgSO<sub>4</sub>, and 0.5 mM CaCl<sub>2</sub>). Coronal brain slices (400 μm) were cut using a vibratome (VT 1200S, Leica Microsystems). The slices were incubated at 28°C in oxygenated aCSF (119 mM NaCl, 2.5 mM KCl, 1 mM NaH<sub>2</sub>PO<sub>4</sub>, 1.3 mM MgSO<sub>4</sub>, 26 mM NaHCO<sub>3</sub>, 10 mM glucose, and 2.5 mM CaCl<sub>2</sub>) for 30 min, and were then kept at room temperature under the same conditions for 1 hr before transfer to the recording chamber at room temperature. The aCSF was perfused at 1 ml/min. The acute brain slices were visualized with a 40× Olympus water immersion lens, differential interference contrast optics (Olympus Inc, Japan), and a CCD camera.</p><p>Patch pipettes were pulled from borosilicate glass capillary tubes (Cat# 64–0793, Warner Instruments, Hamden, CT) using a PC-10 pipette puller (Narishige Inc, Tokyo, Japan). For recording of action potentials (current clamp), pipettes were filled with solution (in mM: 135 K-methanesulfonate, 10 HEPES, 1 EGTA, 1 Na-GTP, 4 Mg-ATP, and 2% neurobiotin, pH 7.4). The resistance of pipettes varied between 3.0 and 3.5 MΩ. The voltage signals were recorded with MultiClamp 700B and Clampex 10 data acquisition software (Molecular Devices). After establishment of the whole-cell configuration and equilibration of the intracellular pipette solution with the cytoplasm, series resistance was compensated to 10–15 MΩ. Recordings with series resistances of &gt;15 MΩ were rejected. An optical fiber (200 μm in diameter) was used to deliver light pulses, with the fiber tip positioned 500 μm above the brain slices. Laser power was adjusted to 5 mW. Light-evoked action potentials from ChR2-mCherry+ neurons in the SC were triggered by a light-pulse train (473 nm, 2 ms, 10 Hz or 20 Hz, 20 mW) synchronized with Clampex 10 data acquisition software (Molecular Devices).</p></sec><sec id="s4-29"><title>RNA in situ hybridization</title><p>Mice were perfused with PBS treated with 0.1% DEPC (Sigma, D5758), followed by DEPC-treated PBS containing 4% PFA (PBS-PFA). Brains were post-fixed in DEPC-treated PBS-PFA solution overnight and then placed in DEPC-treated 30% sucrose solution at 4°C for 30 hr. Brain sections to a thickness of 30 μm were prepared using a cryostat (Leica, CM3050S) and collected in DPEC-treated PBS. Fluorescence in situ hybridization (FISH) was performed as previously described (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Chen et al., 2020</xref>) with minor modifications. Briefly, brain sections were rinsed with DPEC-treated PBS, permeabilized with DPEC-treated 0.1% Tween 20 solution (in PBS), and DPEC-treated 2 × SSC containing 0.5% Triton. Brain sections were then treated with H<sub>2</sub>O<sub>2</sub> solution and acetic anhydride solution to reduce nonspecific FISH signals. After 2 hr incubation in prehybridization buffer (50% formamide, 5 × SSC, 0.1% Tween20, 0.1% CHAPS, 5 mM EDTA in DEPC-treated water) at 65°C, brain sections were then hybridized with the hybridization solution containing mouse anti-sense cRNA probes (digoxigenin labeling) for Cbln2 (primers <named-content content-type="sequence">CAGCTTCCACGTGGTCAA</named-content> and <named-content content-type="sequence">AGCCCCCAGCATGAAAAC</named-content>) or Pitx2 (primers <named-content content-type="sequence">CTCTCAGAGTATGTTTTCCCCG</named-content> and <named-content content-type="sequence">AGGATGGGTCGTACATAGCAGT</named-content>) at 65°C for 20 hr. The sequences of cDNA primers for cRNA probes were the same as those in the ISH DATA of the Allen Brain Atlas (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://mouse.brain-map.org/">https://mouse.brain-map.org/</ext-link>). After washing, brain sections were incubated with Anti-Digoxigenin-POD, Fab fragments (1:400, Roche, 11207733910) at 4°C for 30 hr, and FISH signals were detected using a TSA Plus Cyanine three kit (NEL744001KT, PerkinElmer). To visualize the GFP signals, brain sections were incubated with a primary antibody against GFP (1:2000, ab290, Abcam) at 4°C for 24 hr and then with an Alexa Fluor 488-conjugated goat anti-rabbit secondary antibody (1:500, A11034, Invitrogen) at room temperature for 2 hr. Brain sections were mounted and imaged using a Zeiss LSM780 confocal microscope or the Olympus VS120 Slide Scanning System.</p></sec><sec id="s4-30"><title>Immunohistochemistry</title><p>Mice were anesthetized with isoflurane and sequentially perfused with saline and PBS containing 4% PFA. Brains were removed and incubated in PBS containing 30% sucrose until they sank to the bottom. Post-fixation of the brain was avoided to optimize immunohistochemistry. Cryostat sections (40 μm) were collected, incubated overnight with blocking solution (PBS containing 10% goat serum and 0.7% Triton X-100), and then treated with primary antibodies diluted with blocking solution for 3–4 hr at room temperature. Primary antibodies used for immunohistochemistry are displayed in Key resources table. Primary antibodies were washed three times with washing buffer (PBS containing 0.7% Triton X-100) before incubation with secondary antibodies (tagged with Cy2, Cy3, or Cy5; dilution 1:500; Life Technologies Inc, Carlsbad, CA) for 1 hr at room temperature. Sections were then washed three times with washing buffer, stained with DAPI, and washed with PBS, transferred onto Super Frost slides, and mounted under glass coverslips with mounting media.</p><p>Sections were imaged with an Olympus VS120 epifluorescence microscope (10× objective lens) or a Zeiss LSM 710 confocal microscope (20× and 60× oil-immersion objective lens). Samples were excited by 488, 543, or 633 nm lasers in sequential acquisition mode to avoid signal leakage. Saturation was avoided by monitoring pixel intensity with Hi-Lo mode. Confocal images were analyzed with ImageJ software.</p></sec><sec id="s4-31"><title>Data quantification and statistical analyses</title><p>All experiments were performed with anonymized samples in which the experimenter was unaware of the experimental conditions of the mice.

It will likely be a significant resource to those who study how these circuits integrate sensory information to promote motor output.

In these experiments, retrograde tracing from LPTN and ZI is not cell type specific, therefore the existence of an excitatory type that projects to these two brain areas and does not express neither Cbln2 nor Pitx2 cannot be excluded.

In this study, we made fiber photometry recording primarily from the Cbln2+ neurons in the medial SC, because these neurons may be more involved in monitoring the visual targets in the upper visual field, as suggested in a recent review paper on the SC circuits (Ito and Feldheim, 2018). We agree with the reviewer that it would be interesting to see if the more lateral Cbln2+ SC neurons have dorsal or ventral receptive fields. Although we did not do this experiment in the present study, it is very likely that their visual receptive fields are more ventrally distributed in the lateral visual field. We will make a more detailed analyses of Cbln2+ SC neurons in our future study.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>A similar question comes up when assaying the behaviors are medial SC neurons being selectively stimulated/ablated in these experiments.</p></disp-quote><p>We thank the reviewer for pointing this issue out. Indeed, when examining how photostimulation of Cbln2+ SC neurons evoked behaviors, we primarily stimulated the Cbln2+ neurons in the medial SC, because these neurons may be more involved in monitoring the visual targets in the upper visual field (Ito and Feldheim, 2018). When examining how inactivation of Cbln2+ SC neurons affected behaviors, we expressed TeNT in Cbln2+ SC neuron in both lateral and medial SC. In future study, we will systematically examine how Cbln2+ neurons in the medial and / or lateral SC participate in visually-evoked freezing in mice.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Reviewer #2 (Recommendations for the authors):</p><p>1.

A Sankey plot or some other analysis showing the correspondence between these two datasets will help readers connecting the two resources.</p></disp-quote><p>We thank the reviewer for this insightful suggestion. In Zeisel’s study, cells from dorsal midbrain were sequenced without accurate regional dissection of the superior colliculus. To identify SC cells, the authors computed regional enrichment for each cluster of the dorsal midbrain by correlating volumetric and RNA-seq gene expression profile. To compare the SC neuronal subtypes in our study to those in Zeisel’s study, we extracted excitatory neurons and inhibitory neurons from Zeisel’s work with the assigned regional identities of superior colliculus. In their study, SC excitatory neurons and inhibitory neurons were clustered into 4 (MEGLU1, MEGLU4, MELU5 and MEGLU6) and 6 clusters (MEINH5, MEINH6, MEINH7, MEINH8, MEINH10, MEINH11 and MEINH12) (Response Figure 1-figure supplement 2A-B), respectively, while 9 excitatory neuron (Ex-1 to Ex-9) and 10 inhibitory neuron (In-1 to In-10) clusters were identified in our study. We have shown more SC neuron subtypes than their work. To study the correspondences between neuronal subtypes reported in these two studies, we performed integration analysis on these two datasets followed the integration pipeline introduced by R package Seurat for excitatory neurons and inhibitory neurons independently (Figure 1-figure supplement 2C-F).</p><p>For excitatory neurons, we found MEGLU5 with assigned location of SuG layer (Zeisel et al. (2018)) were colocalized with Ex-8 and Ex-9 (this study) which have shown significant higher SuG layer specificity. MEGLU6 with Op identity was mapped onto Ex-6 which has been assigned to Op layer. MEGLU4 and Ex-7 both with SuG identities were highly similar to each other (Figure 1-figure supplement 2D). Other than that, MEGLU1, which was assigned to SC in general, was mapped onto clusters Ex-1 and Ex-2 (Figure 1-figure supplement 2D). In our study, by SPACED, Ex-1 and Ex-2 were labeled as InG/InWh and SC in general, respectively.</p><p>For inhibitory neurons, colocalization of cells with identical putative regional identities was also observed. Namely, MEINH10 and MEINH11 assigned to SuG layer were mapped with In-10 which had a regional identity of SuG. However, most subtypes (5 out of 7, including MEINH5/6/7/8/12) identified by Zeisel et al. were not assigned to any specific SC layers (Figure 1-figure supplement 2F). However, comparing to our data which with more clear spatial information, we revealed mappings between MEINH12 (Zeisel et al. (2018)) and In-4 (InG layer in this study), MEINH7 and In-2 (SuG layer in this study), MEINH6 and In-6 (SC in general in this study), MEINH5 and In-7 (SuG layer in this study), and MEINH8 and In-3 (Op layer in this study) (Figure 1-figure supplement 2F).</p><p>Overall, the integration analysis has shown good correspondences between neuronal subtypes identified in two studies. Plus, our SPACED methods offered more detailed spatial information of SC neural subtypes. These results were added in the revised manuscript as Figure 1-figure supplement 2 and also described in the text.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>1.3.

As shown in Figure 1-figure supplement 2D, a subcluster of cells from MEGLU1 was mapped to Ex-1, which was assigned to InG layer in our study, indicating that spatial localization of those cells could be further revealed. Therefore, before performing SPACED, we subclustered excitatory neuron cluster MEGLU1 into four subclusters (MEGLU1-1 to MEGLU1-4) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="sa2fig2">Author response image 2A</xref>). We then performed spatial mapping method SPACED based on the expression of ten most specific genes for each subcluster. As results, clusters MEGLU4 and MEGLU5 were assigned to SuG layer, while MEGLU6 exhibited high spatial score for the Op layer (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="sa2fig2">Author response image 2B</xref>). MEGLU1 subclusters MEGLU1-1, MEGLU1-3 and MEGLU1-4 didn’t show significant high layer specificity to any layers in the SC and therefore they were not assigned to any layers. The mapping results for those clusters were consistent with that revealed by Zeisel’s methods. Beyond that, MEGLU1 subcluster MEGLU1-2 was assigned to InG layer by SPACED which was not assigned to any specific SC layers by Zeisel’s methods. In summary, the mapping results obtained by SPACED are highly consistent with that from the method implemented by Zeisel et al. and SPACED has shown higher sensitivity for spatial mapping.</p><fig id="sa2fig2"><label>Author response image 2.</label><caption><title>Comparison of mapping results for SC.</title><p>(<bold>A</bold>) tSNE displaying the spatial distribution of excitatory neuron subtypes from Zeisel’s study.

How was the method benchmarked?</p></disp-quote><p>To test how the number of selected genes affects the mapping results of SPACED, we performed SPACED for excitatory neuron subtypes with 10, 15 and 20 DEGs per subtype independently. As shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="sa2fig3">Author response image 3A-B</xref>, with the increasing of selected genes, the number of assigned clusters decreased. Since for gene selection, we computed gene expression specificity among clusters and ranked genes in descending order based on their specificity value. Then for each cluster, the most-cluster-specific genes were selected for downstream SPACED analysis. Therefore, as the number of the genes included for spatial mapping increasing, the gene expression specificity decreases and may affect the results of spatial assignments. For reference, we have added the description of the impact of number of selected genes on the mapping results to our GitHub repository and recommended for using the top 10 most-cluster-specific genes for analysis (https://github.com/xiaoqunwanglab/SPACED) and also in the revised methods.</p><fig id="sa2fig3"><label>Author response image 3.</label><caption><title>Impact of the number of selected genes on mapping results of SPACED.</title><p>(A) Scatter plot showing the relation between number of selected genes and the number of assigned clusters.

For benchmarking, we then tested if SPACED is applicable for other brain regions. To this end, we applied SPACED on cortical pyramidal neurons sequenced by Zeisel et al. and compare the mapping results to that obtained in their study. As shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="sa2fig4">Author response image 4A</xref>, the cortical pyramidal neurons were grouped into 5 clusters and were assigned to 5 different cortical layers by Zeisel’s method. Using our SPACED method, the same mapping results were achieved (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="sa2fig4">Author response image 4B</xref>), as TEGLU7, TEGLU8, TEGLU10, TEGLU3 and TEGLU2 were assigned to cortical layer 2/3, layer4, layer5, layer6 and layer 6b, respectively. Therefore, besides SC, SPACED is also applicable for other brain regions, such as cortex and produced comparable mapping results. However, SPACED also has its limitation. As for in-situ hybridization image analysis, an important step of SPACED, we have to draw the ROIs (regions of interest) of the brain areas and then calculate signal intensity of genes and the region specificity sore as described in the Methods section in the manuscript. Therefore, SPACED is restricted to the brain regions which have clear anatomic structures and distinguishable borders, such as SC and cortex. For reference, we have added the description of methods limitation to our GitHub repository (https://github.com/xiaoqunwang-lab/SPACED).</p><fig id="sa2fig4"><label>Author response image 4.</label><caption><title>Mapping cortical pyramidal neurons to spatial locations.</title><p>(A) UMAP showing the distribution of cortical pyramidal neuron subtypes (left) and their probable locations (right).

This strategy took advantage of tTA-mediated leakage expression of GFP and have been shown to be efficient for sparse labeling of small number of neurons in specific brain areas (Lin et al., 2018).

The integration of molecular and projection data relies entirely on the Patch-seq experiments. Figure 2J, however, shows that there are neurons retrogradely labeled from InG-ZI and Op-LPTN that do not express neither Cbln2 not Pitx2. Is it possible that these neurons belong to another excitatory type? In these experiments, retrograde tracing from LPTN and ZI is not cell type specific, therefore the existence of an excitatory type that projects to these two brain areas and does not express neither Cbln2 nor Pitx2 cannot be excluded. I suggest performing FISH for Cbln2 and Pitx2 on vGlut-IRES-Cre animals injected with AAV2-retro-DIO-EGFP in the LPTN or ZI.</p></disp-quote><p>We thank the reviewer for pointing this out. We agree with the reviewer that there are several cells express neither Cbln2 nor Pitx2 (12 out of 60; 6 from Op and 6 from InG). When we carried out integration analyses (Figure 2-figure supplement 1J), we found among these 12 cells, 6 cells mapped to Ex-2 (no layer specificity), 2 cells mapped to Ex-1 (considered as InG layer neurons), 2 cells mapped to Ex-8 (considered as SuG layer neurons), 1 cell mapped to Ex-9 (considered as SuG layer neurons) and 1 cell couldn’t map to any ExN clusters. These data indicate that the LPTN- or ZI- projecting neurons are diverse. Additionally, from retrograde tracing analysis, we also agree with the reviewer that there exist Cbln2-negative LPTN-projecting SC neurons and Pitx2-negative ZI-projecting SC neurons. Thus, in the revised manuscript, we do not claim that the Cbln2+ neurons are the only neuronal subtype that project to the LPTN. Similarly, we do not claim that the Pitx2+ neurons are the only neuronal subtype to project to the ZI.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>2.3.
