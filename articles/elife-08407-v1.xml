In <italic>Drosophila</italic>, commissural axons avoid premature responsiveness to the midline repellant Slit by expressing the endosomal sorting receptor Commissureless, which reduces surface expression of the Slit receptor Roundabout1 (Robo1). In this study, we describe a distinct mechanism to inhibit Robo1 repulsion and promote midline crossing, in which Roundabout2 (Robo2) binds to and prevents Robo1 signaling. Unexpectedly, we find that Robo2 is expressed in midline cells during the early stages of commissural axon guidance, and that over-expression of Robo2 can rescue <italic>robo2</italic>-dependent midline crossing defects non-cell autonomously. We show that the extracellular domains required for binding to Robo1 are also required for Robo2's ability to promote midline crossing, in both gain-of-function and rescue assays. These findings indicate that at least two independent mechanisms to overcome Slit-Robo1 repulsion in pre-crossing commissural axons have evolved in <italic>Drosophila</italic>.</p><p><bold>DOI:</bold> <ext-link ext-link-type="doi" xlink:href="10.7554/eLife.08407.001">http://dx.doi.org/10.7554/eLife.08407.001</ext-link></p></abstract><abstract abstract-type="executive-summary"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.08407.002</object-id><title>eLife digest</title><p>When an animal embryo is developing, nerve pathways grow to connect the left and right halves of the nervous system. These pathways allow coordination between the two sides of the body—which is important for tasks such as walking and swimming. However, in order for these pathways to be properly established, the activity of certain genes must determine whether each nerve fiber (or axon) will stay on one side of the body, or cross the midline to the other side.</p><p>It is not fully understood how genes, and the proteins they encode, interact with each other to regulate the crossing of the body's midline, but the process is known to involve proteins called Robo receptors. Robo receptors are a class of proteins found on nerve fibers. Most Robo receptors work to prevent nerve fibers from crossing the midline, but some proteins in this family—including Robo2—can also promote midline crossing. Based on previous studies, it was not clear how Robo2 could have such opposing effects on different sets of nerve cells.</p><p>Evans, Santiago et al. have now explored how Robo2 regulates the development of the nervous system of fruit fly embryos, and found that Robo2 promotes midline crossing by inhibiting the activity of a closely related protein called Robo1. Further experiments unexpectedly showed that Robo2 does not promote midline crossing in the cells in which it is produced. Instead, the Robo2 receptor instructs other Robo1-producing nerve cells to cross the midline. These findings reconcile the previous, seemingly paradoxical, observations about the activity of Robo2.</p><p>Following on from these findings, one important next step will be to determine exactly how Robo2 can inhibit the activity of Robo1, such that it no longer prevents nerve fibers from crossing the midline. Determining whether similar inhibitory interactions between Robo receptors are important for the development of other tissues in the fruit fly, or in other animals, is another challenge for the future.</p><p><bold>DOI:</bold> <ext-link ext-link-type="doi" xlink:href="10.7554/eLife.08407.002">http://dx.doi.org/10.7554/eLife.08407.002</ext-link></p></abstract><kwd-group kwd-group-type="author-keywords"><title>Author keywords</title><kwd>axon guidance</kwd><kwd>midline</kwd><kwd>slit</kwd><kwd>robo receptors</kwd><kwd>growth cone</kwd></kwd-group><kwd-group kwd-group-type="research-organism"><title>Research organism</title><kwd><italic>D. melanogaster</italic></kwd></kwd-group><funding-group><award-group id="par-1"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000002</institution-id><institution>National Institutes of Health (NIH)</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>RO1NS046333</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Bashaw</surname><given-names>Greg J</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="par-2"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000002</institution-id><institution>National Institutes of Health (NIH)</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>RO1NS054739</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Bashaw</surname><given-names>Greg J</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="par-3"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000002</institution-id><institution>National Institutes of Health (NIH)</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>F32-NS-060357</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Evans</surname><given-names>Timothy A</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="par-4"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000001</institution-id><institution>National Science Foundation (NSF)</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>DGE-0822</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Santiago</surname><given-names>Celine</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><funding-statement>The funders had no role in study design, data collection and interpretation, or the decision to submit the work for publication.</funding-statement></funding-group><custom-meta-group><custom-meta><meta-name>elife-xml-version</meta-name><meta-value>2.3</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta specific-use="meta-only"><meta-name>Author impact statement</meta-name><meta-value>The Roundabout2 receptor acts non-autonomously to promote commissural axons to cross the midline by antagonizing Slit-dependent axon repulsion.</meta-value></custom-meta></custom-meta-group></article-meta></front><body><sec id="s1" sec-type="intro"><title>Introduction</title><p>The secreted Slit repellents and their Roundabout (Robo) receptors constitute a repulsive axon guidance system whose function is conserved across a wide range of animal taxa including vertebrates, planarians, nematodes, and insects (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Brose and Tessier-Lavigne, 2000</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Evans and Bashaw, 2012</xref>). Slits are normally expressed at the midline of the central nervous system (CNS), and axons expressing Robo receptors are thus repelled from the midline (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Battye et al., 1999</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Brose et al., 1999</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Kidd et al., 1999</xref>). Prior to crossing the midline, commissural neurons in vertebrates and insects prevent premature responsiveness to Slit by regulating the expression and activity of Robo receptors through a variety of mechanisms (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Evans and Bashaw, 2010a</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">Neuhaus-Follini and Bashaw, 2015</xref>). For example, the divergent Robo receptor Robo3/Rig-1 in vertebrates negatively regulates the activity of the Robo1 (Roundabout1) and Robo2 (Roundabout2) receptors in pre-crossing commissural axons in the spinal cord, thereby allowing midline crossing (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">Sabatier et al., 2004</xref>). In <italic>Drosophila</italic>, Commissureless (Comm) antagonizes Slit-Robo1 repulsion by preventing the trafficking of the Robo1 receptor to the growth cone, instead diverting newly synthesized Robo1 into the endocytic pathway (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Kidd et al., 1998b</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Keleman et al., 2002</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">2005</xref>). As commissural axons approach the midline, Comm expression is high, allowing axons to cross the midline (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Keleman et al., 2002</xref>). Once the midline is reached, Comm is down regulated, restoring Robo1-dependent Slit sensitivity and ensuring that commissural axons do not re-cross the midline. Accordingly, loss of Robos or Slits can cause axons to ectopically cross the midline, while loss of Comm or Robo3/Rig1 prevents commissural axons from crossing (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib41">Tear et al., 1996</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Kidd et al., 1998a</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">1999</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Long et al., 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">Sabatier et al., 2004</xref>).</p><p>In <italic>Drosophila</italic>, the three members of the Robo receptor family (Robo1, Robo2, and Robo3) cooperate to control multiple aspects of axon guidance during embryonic development, including midline repulsion of axons and the formation of longitudinal axon pathways at specific mediolateral positions within the nerve cord. Although Robo2 contributes to promoting midline repulsion, gain-of-function genetic experiments suggest that in some contexts Robo2 can also promote midline crossing (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">Rajagopalan et al., 2000</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">Simpson et al., 2000b</xref>). More recently, endogenous roles for <italic>robo2</italic> in promoting midline crossing were identified during the guidance of foreleg gustatory neurons in the adult, as well as during the guidance of interneurons in the embryonic CNS (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Mellert et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib40">Spitzweck et al., 2010</xref>). Robo2's pro-crossing role in the embryo is highlighted in <italic>frazzled</italic> and <italic>Netrin</italic> mutant backgrounds, in which midline attraction is partially compromised (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib40">Spitzweck et al., 2010</xref>). In the absence of Netrin-dependent midline axon attraction, loss of <italic>robo2</italic> (but not <italic>robo1</italic> or <italic>robo3</italic>) leads to a dramatic disruption in midline crossing that is far more severe than the complete loss of Netrins, indicating that <italic>robo2</italic> likely acts in parallel to Netrin-Fra to promote midline crossing (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib40">Spitzweck et al., 2010</xref>).</p><p>In a complementary series of gain-of-function experiments using a panel of chimeric receptors comprising different regions of Robo1 and Robo2 fused together, we have previously shown that Robo2's ability to promote ectopic midline crossing correlates with the presence of the first and second immunoglobulin-like domains (Ig1 and Ig2) within its extracellular domain (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Evans and Bashaw, 2010b</xref>). Consistent with these observations, replacing endogenous Robo2 by homologous recombination with chimeric receptors, in which the cytoplasmic domains of the Robo1 and Robo2 receptors were exchanged, reveals that the Robo2-1 chimeric receptor (containing the extracellular region of the Robo2 receptor) can rescue the commissural guidance defect observed in <italic>Netrin</italic>, <italic>robo2</italic> mutants more effectively than the reciprocal chimeric receptor (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib40">Spitzweck et al., 2010</xref>). However, the mechanism by which Robo2 promotes midline crossing remains unclear. We can envision two alternative models that could account for Robo2's role in promoting midline crossing of commissural axons. First, Robo2 may act as an attractive receptor to signal midline attraction in response to a ligand produced by midline glia, analogous to Frazzled/Deleted in Colorectal Cancer (DCC)'s role in Netrin-dependent midline attraction. Indeed, a role for Robo2 in mediating attractive responses to Slit has been described in the context of muscle cell migration (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Kramer et al., 2001</xref>). Alternatively, Robo2 may antagonize Slit-Robo1 repulsion by preventing Robo1 from signaling in response to midline-derived Slit, similar to the proposed role of Robo3/Rig-1 in pre-crossing commissural axons in the vertebrate spinal cord (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1</xref>). Although Comm is an essential regulator of Robo1 activity in <italic>Drosophila</italic>, low levels of Robo1 escape Comm-dependent sorting and can be detected on commissural axons, raising the question of whether and how the activity of these Robo1 receptors is regulated (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Kidd et al., 1998a</xref>).<fig id="fig1" position="float"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.08407.003</object-id><label>Figure 1.</label><caption><title>Robo2 commissural guidance defects are rescued by a Robo2 BAC transgene.</title><p>(<bold>A</bold>–<bold>E</bold>) Stage 17 Drosophila embryos of the indicated genotypes stained with anti-HRP antibodies to label all CNS axons.

Bottom right: Two possible models for how Robo2 might promote midline crossing of commissural axons. Left, Robo2 may act as a midline attractive receptor to promote midline crossing in response to an unidentified ligand, analogous to Fra's role as an attractive Netrin receptor. Right, Robo2 may antagonize canonical Slit-Robo1 repulsive signaling to down-regulate midline repulsion and thus allow Robo1-expressing axons to cross the midline.</p><p><bold>DOI:</bold> <ext-link ext-link-type="doi" xlink:href="10.7554/eLife.08407.003">http://dx.doi.org/10.7554/eLife.08407.003</ext-link></p></caption><graphic xlink:href="elife-08407-fig1-v1"/></fig></p><p>Here, we show that in addition to its cell-autonomous role in midline repulsion, Robo2 acts non-autonomously to promote midline crossing by inhibiting canonical Slit-Robo1 repulsion and offer insights into the molecular and cellular mechanisms underlying this activity of Robo2. We find that the cytoplasmic domain of Robo2 is dispensable for its pro-crossing role, suggesting that Robo2 does not transduce a midline attractive signal, and that Robo2 over-expression can suppress <italic>comm</italic> mutants, supporting a model in which Robo2 antagonizes Slit-Robo1 repulsion. Moreover, Robo2 can bind to Robo1 in <italic>Drosophila</italic> embryonic neurons, and this biochemical interaction, like Robo2's pro-crossing role, correlates with the presence of Ig1 and Ig2. Surprisingly, we observe that Robo2 is able to promote midline crossing of axons non-cell autonomously when mis-expressed in midline cells, and we further show that Robo2 is expressed in midline glia and neurons during the early stages of commissure formation. Finally, we find that restoring Robo2 expression in midline cells can rescue midline crossing of axons in <italic>robo2, fra</italic> double mutants and that this rescue activity is dependent on Ig1 and Ig2. Together, our results indicate that Robo2 acts non-autonomously to bind to Robo1 and prevent Slit-Robo1 repulsion in pre-crossing commissural axons. This model accounts for Robo2's seemingly paradoxical roles in both promoting and inhibiting midline crossing and explains how the small amount of Robo1 present on pre-crossing commissural axons might be prevented from responding to Slit.</p></sec><sec id="s2" sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><p>The midline attractive ligand Netrin and its receptor Frazzled (Fra) are the only known attractive ligand-receptor pair in <italic>Drosophila</italic>, yet many commissural axons still cross the midline in the absence of attractive Netrin-Frazzled signaling (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Kolodziej et al., 1996</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Mitchell et al., 1996</xref>). It has recently been demonstrated that the Robo family receptor Robo2 acts independently of Netrin and Fra to promote midline crossing, through an as yet unknown mechanism (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib40">Spitzweck et al., 2010</xref>). In <italic>robo2</italic>, <italic>fra</italic> double mutants, midline crossing of commissural axons is severely compromised, leading to thin or absent commissures, a phenotype that is qualitatively and quantitatively more severe than loss of <italic>fra</italic> alone (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1</xref>). This phenotype can be observed by staining the entire axon scaffold with anti-HRP antibodies (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1A–D</xref>) or by labeling a subset of commissural axons using <italic>eg-GAL4</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Garbe et al., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">O'Donnell and Bashaw, 2013</xref>) in <italic>robo2, fra</italic> double mutants (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1F–I</xref>). To quantify the midline crossing defects, we scored the number of segments in which the EW axons, which normally cross the midline in the posterior commissure, fail to cross (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1</xref>, histogram). We find that in <italic>robo2, fra</italic> double mutants approximately 70% of EW axons fail to cross the midline, compared to around 30% in <italic>fra</italic> mutants. Analysis of cell fate markers including Eg, even-skipped and zfh1 revealed no gross differences in segmentation and neuronal differentiation in <italic>robo2, fra</italic> double mutants, and although the cell bodies of the EW neurons were sometimes displaced, they were easily identifiable (data not shown). Importantly, restoring Robo2 expression by introducing one copy of an 83.9 kb <italic>robo2</italic> bacterial artificial chromosome (BAC) transgene that includes the entire 40 kb <italic>robo2</italic> transcription unit in this background significantly rescues the EW axon crossing defects (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1E,J</xref>), confirming that this is a <italic>robo2-</italic>dependent phenotype.</p><sec id="s2-1"><title>Robo2's pro-crossing activity does not require its cytoplasmic domain</title><p>If Robo2 were to act as a midline attractive receptor (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1</xref>, model 1), its cytoplasmic domain would likely be required for midline attraction. To test whether the Robo2 cytoplasmic domain contributes to its pro-crossing activity, we tested whether a truncated Robo2 receptor lacking its cytoplasmic domain (Robo2∆C) could promote midline crossing when mis-expressed in embryonic neurons. We found that, as with full-length Robo2, pan-neural mis-expression of Robo2∆C (with <italic>elav-GAL4</italic>) produced strong ectopic crossing of FasII-positive axons in the embryonic CNS (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2</xref>). Indeed, the Robo2∆C mis-expression phenotype was stronger than full-length Robo2. In contrast, pan-neural over-expression of Robo1 did not generate ectopic crossing (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2</xref>). In these experiments, all UAS-Robo transgenes are expressed from the same genomic insertion site in order to ensure that they are expressed at similar levels. Importantly, the pro-crossing activity of Robo2∆C is unlikely to be caused solely by a dominant-negative effect of the truncated receptor, as a similarly truncated form of Robo1 (Robo1∆C) has a qualitatively weaker ectopic crossing phenotype when combined with <italic>elav-GAL4</italic> (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2</xref>). Robo2∆C expression, unlike Robo1∆C, leads to ectopic crossing of all of the ipsilateral FasII axon bundles and also results in many segments exhibiting a <italic>slit</italic>-like phenotype (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2</xref>). Due to the strong phenotypic effects of the targeted insertion lines of Robo1∆C and Robo2∆C, we also compared the phenotypes generated by lower levels of expression of the two truncated receptors using standard UAS inserts and observed that Robo2∆C is significantly more potent at driving ectopic midline crossing than comparable levels of the Robo1∆C receptor (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3</xref>). Together these observations indicate that the pro-crossing activity of Robo2 is independent of the cytoplasmic domain and argue against the idea that Robo2 promotes midline crossing by signaling attraction.<fig id="fig2" position="float"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.08407.004</object-id><label>Figure 2.</label><caption><title>Robo2 can promote midline crossing independent of its cytoplasmic domain.</title><p>(<bold>A</bold>–<bold>E</bold>) Stage 17 embryos carrying <italic>elav-GAL4</italic> and the indicated <italic>UAS-Robo</italic> transgenes, stained with anti-HRP (magenta) and the longitudinal pathway marker anti-FasciclinII (FasII; green).

Pan-neural over-expression of Robo2 produces a phenotype in which some axons are repelled from the midline, and some axons ectopically cross the midline, reflecting Robo2's two opposing activities in regulating midline crossing.

In contrast, we found that the Robo2 receptor lacking Ig1 retained a partial ability to promote ectopic midline crossing of FasII-positive axons, indicating that the pro-crossing activity of Robo2 does not strictly depend on its ability to bind Slit (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5</xref>).

To directly test whether Ig2 is necessary for Robo2 to promote midline crossing, we generated a Robo2 receptor lacking Ig2 but with all other Ig domains intact (Robo2∆Ig2). We found that deleting Robo2's Ig2 domain did not interfere with Slit binding (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4</xref>), nor did it affect Robo2's ability to signal repulsion in commissural neurons (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4</xref>). However, deletion of Robo2's Ig2 domain strongly disrupted its ability to promote ectopic midline crossing (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5</xref>). The low level of ectopic crossing induced by Robo2∆Ig2 was indistinguishable from that caused by Robo3, a related receptor that does not share Robo2's pro-midline crossing activity (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5</xref>). These results contrast with those observed with Robo2∆Ig1, which lacks Slit-dependent midline repulsive activity but retains some pro-midline crossing activity (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4 fig5">Figures 4, 5</xref>). These data indicate that Robo2's Ig2 domain is essential for promoting midline crossing when Robo2 is mis-expressed in all neurons. In these experiments, all UAS-Robo transgenes are expressed from the same genomic insertion site in order to ensure that they are expressed at similar levels. In addition, we assayed the protein localization and expression levels of Robo2 and its deletion variants and observed comparable surface expression in cultured S2R+ cells in vitro, as well as comparable expression levels and localization in CNS axons in vivo (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s2">Figure 4—figure supplement 2</xref>).</p></sec><sec id="s2-4"><title>Robo2 can promote crossing non-autonomously</title><p>Midline crossing is strongly reduced in <italic>robo2, fra</italic> double mutants, and pan-neural mis-expression of Robo2 can promote ectopic midline crossing.

Indeed, <italic>elav-GAL4</italic> is transiently expressed in midline glia as well as post-mitotic neurons, preventing us from ruling out a non-neuronal contribution to the observed mis-expression phenotypes.

In contrast to the very different phenotypes caused by pan-neural mis-expression of these two truncated receptors (where Robo2∆C is much more potent at inducing midline crossing than Robo1∆C), Robo1∆C and Robo2∆C induce similar low levels of ectopic crossing when expressed in the apterous neurons (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6A</xref>).

Does Robo2 antagonize Slit-Robo1 repulsion through another mechanism? In order to test this hypothesis, we took advantage of <italic>comm</italic> mutants, which provide a genetic background in which hyperactive Slit-Robo1 signaling completely prevents midline crossing. In <italic>comm</italic> mutants, endogenous Robo1 is inappropriately trafficked to the growth cone plasma membrane in pre-crossing commissural axons, triggering premature Slit repulsion and preventing commissure formation. We reasoned that if Robo2 antagonizes Slit-Robo1 repulsion, then Robo2 mis-expression might restore midline crossing in <italic>comm</italic> mutant embryos. Indeed, pan-neural mis-expression of Robo2 with <italic>elav-GAL4</italic> significantly restored commissure formation in <italic>comm</italic> mutant embryos (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig10">Figure 10</xref>).

One possibility is that Robo2 may form an inhibitory receptor–receptor complex with Robo1 to prevent it from signaling midline repulsion in response to Slit. If this is the case, we reasoned that we might be able to detect a physical interaction between Robo2 and Robo1 in embryonic protein extracts. To test this idea, we mis-expressed epitope-tagged forms of Robo1 and Robo2 in <italic>Drosophila</italic> embryonic neurons with <italic>elav-GAL4</italic> and looked for physical interactions by co-immunoprecipitation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig11">Figure 11</xref>). We found that Robo1-myc and HA-Robo2 co-immunoprecipitated from embryonic lysates when both were expressed in embryonic neurons (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig11">Figure 11A</xref>). Interactions were also observed between Robo1 and the closely related Robo3 receptor but not with a similarly tagged and structurally related Fra receptor (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig11">Figure 11A</xref>). As we would predict from our gain of function experiments, Robo2's ability to bind to Robo1 is independent of its cytoplasmic domain (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig11">Figure 11</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig11s1">Figure 11—figure supplement 1</xref>). Importantly, Robo2's ability to bind Robo1 depends on the Ig1–Ig2 region of Robo2, as Robo1<sup>R2Ig1+2</sup> was readily co-immunoprecipitated with Robo1, while binding between Robo1 and the reciprocal receptor Robo2<sup>R1Ig1+2</sup> was only weakly detected (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig11">Figure 11B</xref>). Consistently, deleting both of the Ig1 and Ig2 domains from Robo2 results in a diminished interaction with Robo1 in vivo and in vitro (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig11">Figure 11</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig11s1">Figure 11—figure supplement 1</xref>). The fact that not all binding is eliminated when both Ig1 and Ig2 are deleted suggests that other regions of the Robo2 receptor may contribute to the interaction with Robo1. Thus, we see a correlation between the presence of the Ig1 and Ig2 domains, a biochemical interaction with Robo1, and pro-crossing activity in the Robo2 receptor. These observations suggest that Robo2 may promote midline crossing through inhibitory interactions with Robo1, likely mediated at least in part by the Robo2 Ig1 and Ig2 domain. Of note, the Ig2 domain is essential for Robo2's pro-crossing activity but is not required for the interaction with Robo1 or Slit, suggesting the existence of an Ig2-specific activity that is distinct from the ability to bind Robo1 or Slit. One possible mechanism that could explain how receptor–receptor interactions could prevent Robo1 signaling is through blocking the access of Slit to the Ig1 region of Robo1. Deleting Robo1's Ig1 domain does not significantly attenuate the interaction with Robo2, but further experiments will be necessary to determine if Robo2 interferes with Robo1's interaction with Slit (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig11">Figure 11</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig11s1">Figure 11—figure supplement 1</xref>).<fig-group><fig id="fig11" position="float"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.08407.016</object-id><label>Figure 11.</label><caption><title>Robo2 binds to the Robo1 receptor in vitro and in vivo.</title><p>(<bold>A</bold>–<bold>C</bold>) Protein extracts from embryos expressing Robo1-Myc and various HA-tagged receptors in all neurons were immunoprecipitated with anti-Myc antibodies and analyzed by western blot.

Loss of function experiments point to an endogenous requirement for Robo2 in promoting midline crossing. Additional genetic analyses indicate that Robo2 can antagonize Robo1 in the absence of its cytoplasmic domain and that this inhibitory effect can be generated by non-cell autonomous expression of Robo2. These observations, together with the demonstration that Robo2 variants that promote midline crossing are potent suppressors of <italic>comm</italic> mutants, support the model that Robo2 inhibits Slit-Robo1 repulsion, rather than acting as a receptor that promotes midline axon attraction. Biochemical and gain of function genetic analyses show that Robo2 can bind to Robo1 in vivo through its Ig1 and Ig2 domains and that this binding interaction correlates with Robo2's pro-crossing activity. Furthermore, cell type specific rescue experiments and analysis of Robo2 mRNA and protein expression are consistent with a requirement for Robo2 in midline cells and support an endogenous requirement for Robo2's Ig2 domain in promoting midline crossing. Taken together, the data in this manuscript support the model that Robo2 expressed in cells other than commissural neurons acts to inhibit Robo1 receptor activity through extracellular domain binding interactions, and that this activity ensures the precise execution of midline guidance (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig13">Figure 13</xref>). Our model reconciles two previously confounding observations: one, that a small amount of Robo1 protein is detectable on commissural axons as they cross the midline, yet this pool of Robo1 is unable to signal midline repulsion; and two, that the single known isoform of Robo2 can act to both promote and inhibit midline crossing.<fig id="fig13" position="float"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.08407.019</object-id><label>Figure 13.</label><caption><title>A model of Robo2's pro-crossing function.</title><p>In contralateral neurons, the endosomal sorting receptor Comm is expressed, and it prevents the majority of Robo1 from reaching the growth cone surface.

Indeed, in wild-type animals, there is no obvious requirement for Robo2's pro-crossing activity, at least not at the embryonic midline in the populations of neurons that we have assayed. A requirement for Robo2 in promoting midline crossing in otherwise wild-type animals has been described for the guidance of foreleg gustatory neurons in the adult nervous system, although it is not clear in this context if the same mechanism that we have described is at work (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Mellert et al., 2010</xref>). Nevertheless, a clear endogenous contribution for Robo2 at the embryonic midline can be demonstrated in conditions where attractive guidance cues, such as Netrin, are compromised. One probable explanation for the existence of this second regulatory mechanism is that it confers robustness on the essential process of midline circuit formation, and that this is important to the animal when developmental conditions are not optimal.</p><p>While Comm is an efficient and potent negative regulator of Robo1 trafficking to the growth cone surface, it is clear that not all Robo1 is prevented from reaching the surface in the presence of Comm. Low levels of Robo1 can be detected on commissural axons by immunostaining and immunoelectron microscopy (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Kidd et al., 1998a</xref>). Data from surface labeling experiments indicate that Comm acts on newly synthesized Robo1, and the question of how Robo1 receptors already present on the plasma membrane prior to the initiation of <italic>comm</italic> expression might be regulated remains unresolved (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Keleman et al., 2002</xref>). The role of Robo2 may thus be to negatively regulate the low levels of Robo1 that escape Comm-dependent sorting.</p><p>In addition to the complementary actions of Comm, a cell autonomous regulator of Robo1 trafficking (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Keleman et al., 2002</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">2005</xref>), and Robo2, a cell non-autonomous inhibitor of Robo1 signaling (this study), it is likely that there are additional levels of regulation that contribute to preventing premature response to midline Slit. In particular, a recent study shows quite convincingly that Comm's role in sorting Robo1 is insufficient to explain how Robo1 activity is limited in pre-crossing commissural axons. Specifically, embryos in which the endogenous Robo1 receptor is replaced with a variant of Robo1 that is insensitive to the sorting activity of Comm by homologous recombination show no defects in midline crossing (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Gilestro, 2008</xref>). This observation is in marked contrast to the prediction of the sorting model, in which embryos carrying a Comm-resistant Robo1 receptor would be expected to resemble <italic>comm</italic> mutants. It will be of great interest to obtain an explanation for this paradoxical finding and to determine what additional targets of Comm could also regulate Slit-dependent repulsion.</p></sec><sec id="s3-2"><title>Inhibitory receptor–receptor interactions in trans: a new mechanism to regulate axon guidance</title><p>Our results suggest that Robo2 can inhibit Robo1 activity and that this effect is mediated by receptor–receptor interactions between the Robo2 and Robo1 extracellular domains. Cis-inhibitory interactions, such as those that occur between the transmembrane protein Kekkon 1 and the epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFr) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Ghiglione et al., 2003</xref>), and between ligand and receptor pairs, as in the cases of Ephs/ephrins and Notch/Delta, have been well documented (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">del Alamo et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Kao and Kania, 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib46">Yaron and Sprinzak, 2012</xref>). While we were not able to detect trans interactions by co-immunoprecipitation or by an S2 cell aggregation assay (data not shown), our genetic data strongly suggest that Robo2 acts in trans to inhibit Robo1 signaling. A recent in vitro screen for trans interactions among <italic>Drosophila</italic> cell surface receptors did not report a direct interaction between Robo1 and Robo2, suggesting that if trans interactions do occur, they might be mediated by a cofactor (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib47">Ökzan et al., 2013</xref>). Indeed, Slit-dependent trans interactions between Robo1 and Robo2 have been proposed to play a role in the migration of sensory neurons in the <italic>Drosophila</italic> peripheral nervous system, although in this case Robo2 is thought to promote Slit-Robo repulsive signaling by presenting Slit to Robo receptors expressed in trans (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Kraut and Zinn, 2004</xref>).</p><p>Previous studies have defined growth factor and morphogen receptor regulatory mechanisms that bear some resemblance to the mechanism that we have described here. For example, EGFr signaling and Bone Morphogenetic Protein receptor (BMPr) signaling can be attenuated cell non-autonomously by various inhibitory factors, such as Argos for EGFrs and Noggin for BMPrs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Klein et al., 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib43">Walsh et al., 2010</xref>). In the case of EGFr, receptor signaling is blocked because the soluble inhibitory factor Argos binds to and sequesters the EGF ligand, thereby preventing receptor activation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Klein et al., 2008</xref>). The mechanism through which Robo2 regulates Robo1 is similar in that it acts cell non-autonomously and that it depends on extracellular interactions, but distinct, since Robo2 does not appear to act solely by binding and sequestering Slit, as the Robo2∆Ig2 receptor can still bind Slit, but is completely unable to inhibit Robo1 activity.</p><p>It remains to be determined, but a closer analogy may exist with the way Dickkopf (DKK) family proteins antagonize Wnt receptor signaling (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">Niehrs, 2006</xref>). In this case, secreted DKK binds to the lipoprotein related proteins (LRP5 and 6), which are co-receptors for Wnt, and prevents LRP interaction with the Frizzled/Wnt ligand receptor complex (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Ahn et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Chen et al., 2011</xref>). While Robo2 is not secreted, there is evidence that Robo1 receptor extracellular domains can be cleaved and shed into the extracellular space (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Coleman et al., 2010</xref>), and we have observed that the Robo2 ectodomain can also be shed in vitro and in vivo (Evans and Bashaw, unpublished). In the future, it will be interesting to investigate whether Robo2 binding prevents Robo1 from interacting with Slit in vivo, and whether Robo2 receptor cleavage is important for its ability to promote midline crossing. Alternatively, Robo2 could prevent the recruitment of Robo1's downstream signaling molecules such as Enabled, Nck/Dock and Son of Sevenless (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Bashaw et al., 2000</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Fan et al., 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib44">Yang and Bashaw, 2006</xref>).</p></sec><sec id="s3-3"><title>How are the diverse axon guidance activities of the Robo2 receptor coordinated?</title><p>In addition to its Ig1/Ig2 dependent role in inhibiting Slit-Robo1 repulsion that we have described here, Robo2 has at least three other distinct axon guidance activities that can be attributed to different structural elements of the receptor. In the context of midline axon repulsion, Robo2 binds Slit through its extracellular Ig1 domain and cooperates with Robo1 to prevent abnormal midline crossing. It is not known how Robo2 signals repulsion, but based on receptor swap experiments that demonstrate that Robo1 can substitute for Robo2's midline repulsive activity, it seems likely that a common cytoplasmic signaling output shared by Robo1 and Robo2 (perhaps mediated by the shared CC0 or CC1 motifs) is important for repulsion (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib40">Spitzweck et al., 2010</xref>). Robo2 also directs the mediolateral position of axons in the CNS, an activity conferred by a combination of its extracellular Ig1 and Ig3 domains (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Evans and Bashaw, 2010b</xref>). In this context, distinct biochemical properties conferred by Ig3 appear to direct Robo2 receptor multimerization, and this property correlates with the ability to regulate lateral position in vivo (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Evans and Bashaw, 2010b</xref>). Finally, in addition to these activities, we have recently discovered a new function for Robo2 in regulating the guidance of specific populations of motor axons to their appropriate muscle targets. In this case, Robo2's guidance activity depends on unique features of its cytoplasmic domain (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">Santiago et al., 2014</xref>).</p><p>A major challenge for the future will be to understand how these diverse guidance activities are selectively deployed at the right time and place to allow for coordinated guidance responses. One important factor that is likely to contribute to the coordination of these activities is the regulation of the spatial and temporal expression of Robo2. For example, in late stage embryos, Robo2 protein expression is restricted to the lateral most regions of the longitudinal connectives where it is presumably acting to control lateral positioning, while in younger embryos <italic>robo2</italic> mRNA can be detected in ipsilateral pioneer neurons where it is likely contributing to midline repulsion. Robo2 is also detected in midline glia and neurons, where we propose it may act to prevent premature responses to Slit. At present, little is known about how these patterns of expression are established and temporally regulated, although we have recently shown that the homeodomain transcription factors <italic>dHb9</italic> and <italic>nkx6</italic> are required for <italic>robo2</italic> expression in a subset of motor neurons (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">Santiago et al., 2014</xref>).</p><p>While controlling the time and place of Robo2 expression is no doubt part of the explanation for how Robo2's diverse and sometimes opposing activities are coordinated, we expect that the distinct biochemical features of Robo2's different activities, as well as the potential interaction with context-specific cofactors will also play an important role. Here, we note that Robo2 does not appear to be able to promote midline crossing cell-autonomously, either in subsets of commissural neurons in rescue experiments, or in the apterous ipsilateral interneurons in gain-of-function experiments. This could be because Robo2 is unable to bind to Robo1 in cis in vivo, or alternatively because Robo1–Robo2 cis interactions confer a distinct outcome from the inhibitory effect of Robo2 presented from other cells. This is reminiscent of the different responses produced by cis and trans interactions between receptors and their ligands (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib46">Yaron and Sprinzak, 2012</xref>). How distinct signaling responses are triggered by the different structural conformations resulting from cis vs trans interactions remains poorly understood. Future experiments to define the mechanisms that control the specific expression domains and biochemical activities of Robo2 promise to continue to offer new insights into the molecular biology of axon guidance.</p></sec></sec><sec id="s4" sec-type="materials|methods"><title>Materials and methods</title><sec id="s4-1"><title>Experimental Procedures</title><sec id="s4-1-1"><title>Genetics</title><p>The following <italic>Drosophila</italic> mutant alleles were used: <italic>fra</italic><sup><italic>3</italic></sup>, <italic>fra</italic><sup><italic>4</italic></sup>, <italic>robo2</italic><sup><italic>x33</italic></sup>, <italic>robo2</italic><sup><italic>x123</italic></sup>, <italic>robo2</italic><sup><italic>x135</italic></sup>, <italic>comm</italic><sup><italic>E39</italic></sup>, <italic>P{GawB}NP6273</italic> (<italic>robo2</italic><sup><italic>GAL4</italic></sup>)<italic>, eg</italic><sup><italic>MZ360</italic></sup> (<italic>eg-GAL4</italic>), <italic>ap-GAL4</italic>, <italic>dHb9</italic><sup><italic>GAL4</italic></sup>, <italic>robo2</italic><sup><italic>HArobo2</italic></sup>.

The work builds upon an earlier finding from the Dickson lab that demonstrated an unexpected role for Robo2 in promoting midline crossing, in addition to its previously characterized role as a midline repellant. In the current work, the authors expand upon this finding and provide data that suggests Robo2 functions in promoting midline crossing by inhibiting Robo1 activity that escapes the commissureless routing effects. The authors characterize this role for Robo2 by examining midline crossing defects in the sensitized background where Netrin-Frazzled signaling is disrupted. The authors demonstrate this effect can occur non-cell autonomously, and provide evidence that midline cells express Robo2 at the correct time of development for it to inhibit Robo1-Slit biology. The authors use domain deletions to show that this effect of Robo2 on promoting crossing is independent of its Slit-binding properties, separating it from the requirements for Robo2 as a midline repellant. The authors also demonstrate binding of Robo2 to Robo1, with some evidence for a trans interaction, and suggest a potential pathway by which Robo2 expressed on midline cells inhibits residual Robo1 on axons to facilitate midline crossing. Among the many features of the paper that are quite compelling is the demonstration that midline crossing by Robo2 does not require its intracellular domain, which likely eliminates a signal-transduction role for Robo2 as a receptor for an unknown positive attractor. This points to an inhibitory role for Robo2. The question then becomes how Robo2 acts. One model would be a cis-inhibition as found for Robo3 in mammalian commissural axons, where it blocks the function of the other Robos. The authors provide data for an alternative model that Robo2 instead acts in midline cells to non-cell autonomously silence Robo1 in a trans interaction. In summary, the data are thorough and the data strongly support new ideas concerning the mechanisms that shape complex neural circuitry during embryonic development. As such, the paper is considered appropriate for the general audience of <italic>eLife</italic>. However, there are a few experimental concerns that should be addressed. Finally, given the general audience targeted by <italic>eLife</italic>, the manuscript needs to be re-written to enable the general readership to better understand access the data and logic presented in this paper.</p><p>1) Throughout the manuscript (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2 fig3 fig5">Figure 2, 3 and 5</xref> in particular), comparisons are made between genotypes expressing different transgenes with conclusions being made regarding the extent of rescue. The authors have gone the extra length to control for differential transgene expression by integrating transgenes at a single expression locus. This is considered excellent. However, concerns were raised by the reviewers that this does not account for the possibility that mutant proteins fail to reach the cell surface. The reviewers acknowledge that it is not possible to make such a determination in the embryo with available reagents. However, controls in heterologous cells to tests that transgenic proteins are processed and traffic correctly would be a nice addition to the manuscript. This experiment would be able to determine gross changes in the trafficking of mutant proteins and would not be expected to measure subtle differences, as this could not be directly compared to the gene expression in vivo.</p><p>2) Slit binding should be quantified, if possible. The S2 cells shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4</xref> could indicate that Slit binding is reduced, or it could be abolished depending on the imaging methods. The differences in magnitude could be quite important for the conclusions of the manuscript. Along this line, an experiment should be performed to test Slit-Robo binding in heterologous cells transfected with either Robo1 alone or with Robo1 and Robo2.</p><p>3) In the subsection headed “Robo2 binds to Robo1 in vivo and the interaction depends on Ig1 and Ig2”, the authors emphasize a trans-signaling interaction. More specifically, the conclusion that Robo1 and Robo2 interact in trans should be tempered (“Although we detected strong interactions between Robo1 and Robo2 in co-transfected cells, we could not detect interactions in cells that were transfected separately and mixed together”). This is one possibility supported by the data, yet there are caveats. For example, no interaction is seen in separately transfected cells unless lysates are prepared where cis and trans can no longer be distinguished. There is some robust biochemistry to demonstrate the Robo2-Robo1 interaction, although the evidence for a strictly trans interaction are the weakest of the data in this section.</p><p>4) The manuscript should be significantly revised to make it accessible to the non-expert reader given the intended general audience of <italic>eLife</italic>. Even a geneticist who is not immersed in this area of research has a difficult time navigating the Results section. The figures are beautiful and the data are both solid and interesting, but the experimental logic and conclusions could be conveyed more clearly and simply. The authors are encouraged to use schematics in their figures and, most importantly, clarify the text.</p><p>5) Many of the figures lack evidence of statistical comparisons in their bar graphs; compare <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1</xref> to Figure 2/3, etc. This should be consistent throughout all figures.</p></body></sub-article><sub-article article-type="reply" id="SA2"><front-stub><article-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.08407.021</article-id><title-group><article-title>Author response</article-title></title-group></front-stub><body><p><italic>1) Throughout the manuscript (</italic><xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2 fig3 fig5"><italic>Figure 2, 3 and 5</italic></xref> <italic>in particular), comparisons are made between genotypes expressing different transgenes with conclusions being made regarding the extent of rescue.

In the original <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4</xref>, all three of the deletion variants are robustly expressed and localized to the plasma membrane as detected by their N-terminal HA epitope tags. In addition, since Robo2∆Ig2 is able to bind to bath applied Slit (and mediate Slit-repulsion in vivo), this receptor must be present on the surface. We also note that the ∆Ig1 variant still has significant pro-crossing activity, which is consistent with surface localization. In addition, our western blots show clear bands of the expected sizes for all of the variants that we analyze, suggesting that there are not problems with protein folding.</p><p>To further address whether or not our Robo2 deletion variants are trafficked normally in vivo, we have added a supplemental figure (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s2">Figure 4–figure supplement 2</xref>) demonstrating that all of the receptor variants are localized to CNS axons and are present at comparable levels. Finally, we have performed detergent free staining of S2R+ cells expressing each receptor variant and observe robust surface localization (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s2">Figure 4–figure supplement 2</xref>).</p><p><italic>2) Slit binding should be quantified, if possible. The S2 cells shown in</italic> <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4"><italic>Figure 4</italic></xref> <italic>could indicate that Slit binding is reduced, or it could be abolished depending on the imaging methods. The differences in magnitude could be quite important for the conclusions of the manuscript</italic>.</p><p>We have now included pixel intensity quantification of the Slit-binding presented in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4</xref> and have included this data as a new supplemental figure (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s1">Figure 4–figure supplement 1</xref>). We find that the Robo2∆Ig1 and Robo2∆Ig1-2 do not detectably bind Slit in this assay. The Slit signal detected on these cells is no different from that observed on untransfected cells. In addition, we note a slight reduction in the ability of Robo2∆Ig2 to bind Slit. The biological meaning of this, if any, is unclear, especially given that Robo2∆Ig2 is equivalent to wild-type Robo2 in its ability to mediate repulsion in response to Slit in vivo. This is true when Robo2∆Ig2 is expressed as a UAS transgene and when Robo2∆Ig2 is expressed from a BAC. In order to more rigorously compare any differences in Slit binding due to deletion of Ig2, more quantitative biochemical/biophysical experiments would be needed. We believe that the key observation here is that as predicted from the structural data, deleting Robo2’s Ig1 domain prevents Slit binding.</p><p><italic>Along this line, an experiment should be performed to test Slit-Robo binding in heterologous cells transfected with either Robo1 alone or with Robo1 and Robo2</italic>.</p><p>As requested, we have performed this experiment and are including the findings as a figure for the reviewers (included at the end of this document). We do not see any obvious differences in the ability of Slit to bind cells that co-express Robo1 and Robo2 from cells that are individually transfected. However, we do not believe that this is a clearly interpretable experiment. Even if Robo2 were able to prevent Slit binding to Robo1, the fact that Robo2 itself is a strong Slit binding receptor would complicate the interpretation of this experiment. In order to rigorously address this issue, future competition binding experiments using purified proteins and surface plasmon resonance will be needed. We feel that such analysis is beyond the scope of the current manuscript and that given the caveats to interpreting the cell binding in co-transfected cells, we would rather not include this data in the manuscript.</p><p><italic>3) In the subsection headed “Robo2 binds to Robo1 in vivo and the interaction depends on Ig1 and Ig2”, the authors emphasize a trans-signaling interaction.
