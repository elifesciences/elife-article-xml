cohort. Although collective cell migrations are common in animal development, little is known about how protrusions are coherently polarized among groups of migrating epithelial cells. We address this problem in the collective migration of the follicular epithelial cells in <italic>Drosophila melanogaster</italic>. In this epithelium, the cadherin Fat2 localizes to the trailing edge of each cell and promotes the formation of F-actin-rich protrusions at the leading edge of the cell behind. We show that Fat2 performs this function by acting in trans to concentrate the activity of the WASP family verprolin homolog regulatory complex (WAVE complex) at one long-lived region along each cell’s leading edge. Without Fat2, the WAVE complex distribution expands around the cell perimeter and fluctuates over time, and protrusive activity is reduced and unpolarized. We further show that Fat2’s influence is very local, with sub-micron-scale puncta of Fat2 enriching the WAVE complex in corresponding puncta just across the leading-trailing cell-cell interface. These findings demonstrate that a trans interaction between Fat2 and the WAVE complex creates stable regions of protrusive activity in each cell and aligns the cells’ protrusions across the epithelium for directionally persistent collective migration.</p></abstract><kwd-group kwd-group-type="author-keywords"><kwd>collective cell migration</kwd><kwd>Fat2</kwd><kwd>WAVE regulatory complex</kwd><kwd>epithelium</kwd><kwd>lamellipodium</kwd><kwd>actin</kwd></kwd-group><kwd-group kwd-group-type="research-organism"><title>Research organism</title><kwd><italic>D. melanogaster</italic></kwd></kwd-group><funding-group><award-group id="fund1"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000002</institution-id><institution>National Institutes of Health</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>R01 GM126047</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Horne-Badovinac</surname><given-names>Sally</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund2"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000002</institution-id><institution>National Institutes of Health</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>R01 HD88831</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Munro</surname><given-names>Edwin</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund3"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000002</institution-id><institution>National Institutes of Health</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>T32 HD055164</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Williams</surname><given-names>Audrey Miller</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund4"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution>Chicago Fellows Postdoctoral Award</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Donoughe</surname><given-names>Seth</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund5"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100001033</institution-id><institution>Jane Coffin Childs Memorial Fund for Medical Research</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Donoughe</surname><given-names>Seth</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><funding-statement>The funders had no role in study design, data collection and interpretation, or the decision to submit the work for publication.</funding-statement></funding-group><custom-meta-group><custom-meta specific-use="meta-only"><meta-name>Author impact statement</meta-name><meta-value>Fat2 signals from the trailing edge of each cell to localize WAVE activity to the leading edge of the cell behind, polarizing protrusive regions within cells and across the epithelium.</meta-value></custom-meta></custom-meta-group></article-meta></front><body><sec id="s1" sec-type="intro"><title>Introduction</title><p>Collective cell migration is essential for a variety of morphogenetic processes in animals (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Friedl and Gilmour, 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib50">Scarpa and Mayor, 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib45">Norden and Lecaudey, 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib47">Perez-Vale and Peifer, 2020</xref>). As with individual cell migrations, adherent collective migrations are driven by the concerted action of cell protrusions, contractile actomyosin networks, and adhesions to a substrate (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib50">Scarpa and Mayor, 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Bodor et al., 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Buttenschön and Edelstein-Keshet, 2020</xref>). To move forward, individual cells polarize these structures along a migratory axis, and to move persistently in one direction, they need to maintain that polarity stably over time (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib59">Stock and Pauli, 2021</xref>). Collective cell migrations introduce a new challenge: to move together, the group of migrating cells must be polarized in the same direction (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib59">Stock and Pauli, 2021</xref>). Otherwise, they would exert forces in different directions and move less efficiently, separate, or fail to migrate altogether.</p><p>The epithelial follicle cells of the <italic>Drosophila melanogaster</italic> ovary are a powerful experimental system in which to investigate how local interactions among migrating cells establish and maintain group polarity. Follicle cells are arranged in a continuous, topologically closed monolayer epithelium that forms the outer cell layer of the ellipsoidal egg chamber—the organ-like structure that gives rise to the egg (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Duhart et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1A–C</xref>). The apical surfaces of follicle cells adhere to a central germ cell cluster, and their basal surfaces face outward and adhere to a surrounding basement membrane extracellular matrix. The follicle cells migrate along this stationary basement membrane, resulting in rotation of the entire cell cluster (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Haigo and Bilder, 2011</xref>). As the cells migrate, they secrete additional basement membrane proteins (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Haigo and Bilder, 2011</xref>). The coordination of migration with secretion causes the cells to produce a basement membrane structure that channels tissue growth along one axis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Gutzeit et al., 1991</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Haigo and Bilder, 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">Isabella and Horne-Badovinac, 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Crest et al., 2017</xref>). Follicle cell migration lasts for roughly 2 days, and the migration direction—and resulting direction of egg chamber rotation—is stable throughout (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Chen et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib57">Stedden et al., 2019</xref>). The edgeless geometry of the epithelium means cells are not partitioned into ‘leader’ and ‘follower’ roles, and there is no open space, chemical gradient, or other external guidance cue to dictate the migration direction. Instead, this feat of stable cell polarization and directed migration is accomplished through local interactions between the migrating cells themselves (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Barlan et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib57">Stedden et al., 2019</xref>).</p><fig id="fig1" position="float"><label>Figure 1.</label><caption><title>Introduction to egg chamber rotation and follicle cell protrusions.</title><p>(<bold>A</bold>) Diagram of a stage 6 egg chamber in cross-section.

The WAVE complex adds branches to actin filaments by activating the Actin-related proteins-2/3 complex (Arp2/3) and elongates existing filaments, building the branched actin network that pushes the leading edge forward (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">Machesky et al., 1999</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Bieling et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib41">Mullins et al., 2018</xref>). Embedded within the lamellipodia are Enabled (Ena)-dependent filopodia, which are visually prominent with F-actin labeling but dispensable for migration (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Cetera et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1D and E</xref>). Removal of filopodia reveals the underlying lamellipodial actin network, whereas removal of WAVE complex subunits eliminates all protrusive structures (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Cetera et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1F</xref>). We use the term ‘protrusions’ to encompass both of these F-actin networks and the membrane deformations they cause.</p><p>The follicle cells align their protrusions across the tissue, a form of planar polarity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Gutzeit et al., 1991</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Cetera et al., 2014</xref>). The atypical cadherin Fat2 is required both for this planar polarity and for collective migration to occur (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib64">Viktorinová et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib65">Viktorinová and Dahmann, 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Horne-Badovinac, 2017</xref>). Fat2 is planar-polarized to the trailing edge of each cell (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib65">Viktorinová and Dahmann, 2013</xref>), where it promotes the formation of protrusions at the leading edge of the cell immediately behind (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Barlan et al., 2017</xref>). Interestingly, in addition to migration depending on polarized Fat2 activity, Fat2’s planar polarity also depends on epithelial migration (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Barlan et al., 2017</xref>). It is not known how Fat2 regulates lamellipodia or cell polarity, or how these processes influence one another. We hypothesized that Fat2 acts as a coupler between tissue planar polarity and cell protrusion by polarizing WAVE complex activity to the leading edge of each cell. To test this, we used genetic mosaic analysis and quantitative imaging of fixed and live tissues to dissect Fat2’s contributions to protrusivity and protrusion polarity at cell and tissue scales.</p><p>We show that Fat2 signals in trans, entraining WAVE complex activity to one long-lived region along each cell’s leading edge. Without Fat2, the WAVE complex accumulates transiently at different regions around the cell perimeter, and cell protrusivity is reduced and unpolarized. The interaction between Fat2 and the WAVE complex is non-cell-autonomous but very local, with sub-micron-scale puncta of Fat2 along the trailing edge concentrating the WAVE complex just across the cell-cell interface, at the tips of filopodia embedded within the lamellipodium. These findings demonstrate how an intercellular interaction between Fat2 and the WAVE complex promotes cell protrusivity, stabilizes regions of protrusive activity along the cell perimeter, and aligns protrusions across the epithelium by coupling leading and trailing edges. Fat2-WAVE complex interaction thereby stabilizes the planar polarity of protrusions for directionally persistent collective migration.</p></sec><sec id="s2" sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><sec id="s2-1"><title>Fat2 increases and polarizes protrusions at the basal surface of the follicular epithelium</title><p>Recent work has shown that Fat2 regulates migration of the follicular epithelium by polarizing F-actin-rich protrusions; specifically, Fat2 at the trailing edge of each cell causes protrusions to form at the leading edge of the cell behind it, and without Fat2, protrusions are reduced or lost (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib55">Squarr et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Barlan et al., 2017</xref>). Beyond this qualitative description, it is not known how Fat2 modulates cell protrusion.</p><p>We sought to obtain a deeper, time-resolved view of the role of Fat2 in regulating protrusivity and protrusion distribution. To do so, we developed methods to segment cell membrane extensions and measure their lengths and orientations, and applied these methods to timelapse movies of the basal surface of control and <italic>fat2<sup>N103-2</sup></italic> epithelia (a null allele, hereafter referred to as <italic>fat2;</italic> <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3</xref>). A detailed description of the segmentation approach is included in the Materials and Methods. To analyze these data, we first measured the average lengths of membrane extensions from all cell-cell interfaces (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3A and B</xref>). The distribution of measured lengths was unimodal, with no natural division between protrusive and non-protrusive interfaces. Therefore, to establish an empirically grounded cutoff between these categories, we recorded timelapse movies of control epithelia treated with the Arp2/3 inhibitor CK-666, which are non-migratory and almost entirely non-protrusive (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Cetera et al., 2014</xref>). We used measurements from CK-666-treated epithelia to set a cutoff for the minimum length of a protrusion: any edges with membrane extensions longer than the 98th percentile of those in CK-666-treated epithelia were considered <italic>protrusive</italic> for subsequent analysis (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3B</xref>).</p><fig id="fig2" position="float"><label>Figure 2.</label><caption><title>Method used to segment and measure membrane protrusions.</title><p>Top row shows an example of a pair of neighboring cells in which one cell is protruding across their shared interface.

We found that the protrusivity of <italic>fat2</italic> epithelia was lower than that of control epithelia on average, but highly variable, with overlap between the protrusivity distributions of both untreated and CK-666-treated epithelia (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3B and C</xref>; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s1">Figure 3—figure supplement 1A,B</xref>; <xref ref-type="video" rid="fig3video1">Figure 3—video 1</xref>). As a complementary method, we also measured protrusivity via F-actin labeling in fixed and live tissues, using <italic>abi</italic>-RNAi-expressing epithelia as a nearly non-protrusive benchmark. The results largely paralleled those seen with membrane labeling (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s2">Figure 3—figure supplement 2</xref>; <xref ref-type="video" rid="fig3video2">Figure 3—video 2</xref>); however, the disparity in protrusivity between <italic>fat2</italic> and control epithelia appeared larger when measured using F-actin labeling than when measured with membrane labeling (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3C</xref>; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s2">Figure 3—figure supplement 2</xref>). Images of follicle cell protrusions visualized by F-actin staining are dominated by fluorescence from filopodia (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1F</xref>). The appearance of lower protrusivity of <italic>fat2</italic> epithelia as measured with an F-actin label may therefore indicate that filopodia are disproportionately reduced by loss of Fat2. Altogether, these data show that <italic>fat2</italic> epithelia are less protrusive than control epithelia, but do retain some protrusive activity.</p><p>These results raised an important question—if some <italic>fat2</italic> epithelia have levels of membrane protrusivity comparable to that of control epithelia, then why do all <italic>fat2</italic> epithelia fail to migrate (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib65">Viktorinová and Dahmann, 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Chen et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Barlan et al., 2017</xref>)? We hypothesized that the mispolarization of protrusions across the tissue contributes to <italic>fat2</italic> migration failure. In control epithelia, the majority of protrusions were polarized in the direction of migration, orthogonally to the egg chamber’s anterior-posterior axis (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3A and D</xref>; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s1">Figure 3—figure supplement 1C</xref>; <xref ref-type="video" rid="fig3video3">Figure 3—video 3</xref>). In contrast, in <italic>fat2</italic> epithelia, protrusions were fairly uniformly distributed in all directions or biased in two opposite directions (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3A and D</xref>; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s1">Figure 3—figure supplement 1C</xref>; <xref ref-type="video" rid="fig3video3">Figure 3—video 3</xref>). Where an axial bias was present, the axis was inconsistent between egg chambers. We also confirmed this finding using F-actin labeling of protrusions. To compare the planar polarity of F-actin protrusions between control and <italic>fat2</italic> epithelia, we measured F-actin enrichment at cell-cell interfaces as a function of the angle of the interface relative to the egg chamber’s anterior-posterior axis. We again saw that protrusions were planar-polarized in control epithelia and unpolarized in <italic>fat2</italic> epithelia (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s2">Figure 3—figure supplement 2</xref>). These data show that Fat2 is required to polarize protrusions in a common direction across the epithelium.</p><p>Because Fat2 regulates both follicle cell migration and planar polarity, and migration and planar polarity are interdependent (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib64">Viktorinová et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib65">Viktorinová and Dahmann, 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Cetera et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Barlan et al., 2017</xref>), the unpolarized protrusions of <italic>fat2</italic> epithelia could be a cause or a consequence of inability of <italic>fat2</italic> epithelia to migrate. To distinguish between these possibilities, we exploited the fact that small groups of <italic>fat2</italic> cells can be carried along by neighboring non-mutant, migratory cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib65">Viktorinová and Dahmann, 2013</xref>), allowing us to evaluate polarity of protrusions from <italic>fat2</italic> cells in a migratory context. We generated <italic>fat2</italic> mosaic tissues that had sufficiently small fractions of mutant cells that the tissue as a whole still migrated, and found that <italic>fat2</italic> cells in these tissues were often protrusive, but their protrusions were not polarized in the direction of migration (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4</xref>; <xref ref-type="video" rid="fig4video1">Figure 4—video 1</xref>). This demonstrates that Fat2 does not simply polarize protrusions indirectly by maintaining tissue-wide migration.

Previous work has shown that WAVE complex levels are reduced at the basal surface of follicle cells lacking Fat2 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib55">Squarr et al., 2016</xref>). Consistent with this result, we found that Sra1-GFP levels were lower along cell-cell interfaces at the basal surface of <italic>fat2</italic> epithelia than of control epithelia (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5s2">Figure 5—figure supplement 2</xref>). Planar polarity of Sra1-GFP across the epithelium was also lost in the absence of Fat2 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5s2">Figure 5—figure supplement 2</xref>). Fat2 acts non-cell-autonomously to cause protrusions to form at the leading edge of the cell just behind (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Barlan et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5C</xref>), so we next tested the hypothesis that Fat2 localizes the WAVE complex to the leading edge in the same non-cell-autonomous pattern. We did this using <italic>fat2</italic> mosaic epithelia, in which we could measure Sra1-GFP levels at leading-trailing interfaces shared by control and <italic>fat2</italic> cells. We found that Sra1-GFP levels were normally enriched along the leading edges of <italic>fat2</italic> cells if control cells were present immediately ahead, showing that Sra1 can still localize to the leading edge of cells lacking Fat2. Conversely, Sra1-GFP levels were reduced along the leading edge of control cells if <italic>fat2</italic> cells were immediately ahead (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5D and E</xref>; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5s2">Figure 5—figure supplement 2</xref>). We also observed a corresponding non-autonomous pattern of membrane protrusion polarity in timelapse movies of <italic>fat2</italic> mosaic epithelia (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4</xref>; <xref ref-type="video" rid="fig4video1">Figure 4—video 1</xref>). We conclude that Fat2 acts non-cell-autonomously to localize the WAVE complex to leading edges, resulting in tissue-wide planar polarization of protrusive activity, and thereby in collective cell migration.</p><p>We next asked if, by recruiting the WAVE complex to the leading edge, Fat2 was reducing its levels at other membrane sites, and thereby suppressing mispolarized protrusion. To test whether Fat2 was measurably depleting the non-leading-edge WAVE complex pool, we compared the level of Sra1-GFP at the medial basal surfaces of cells in control or <italic>fat2</italic> epithelia, or between control and <italic>fat2</italic> cells in mosaic epithelia (see diagram in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5F</xref>). In both cases, we measured small increases in mean Sra1-GFP in <italic>fat2</italic> cells compared to control cells, but these were not statistically significant (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5D and F</xref>; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5s2">Figure 5—figure supplement 2</xref>). Our measurements may not be sensitive enough to detect redistribution of Sra1-GFP occurring across a broad membrane area, or the Sra1-GFP population may be redistributing away from the basal surface. It therefore remains to be determined whether by concentrating the WAVE complex at the leading edge, Fat2 also depletes the WAVE complex from other membrane sites, and thereby suppresses mispolarized protrusions.</p></sec><sec id="s2-3"><title>Fat2 stabilizes a region of WAVE complex enrichment and protrusivity in <italic>trans</italic></title><p>In individually migrating cells, the excitable dynamics of the WAVE complex and its regulators enable it to form transient zones of enrichment along the cell perimeter even in the absence of a directional signal (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib68">Weiner et al., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">Iglesias and Devreotes, 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib59">Stock and Pauli, 2021</xref>). Although the planar-polarized distribution of the WAVE complex across the epithelium was lost in <italic>fat2</italic> mutant tissue, we wondered (1) whether the WAVE complex could still form regions of enrichment in individual cells and (2) whether these WAVE complex-enriched regions were active and responsible for templating unpolarized protrusions. To evaluate the WAVE complex distribution along the edges of individual cells, we generated entirely <italic>fat2</italic> mutant epithelia in which patches of cells expressed Sra1-GFP. At cell-cell interfaces along Sra1-GFP expression boundaries, we found that the boundary cells often had cortical regions devoid of Sra1-GFP (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6A</xref>). This observation shows that the WAVE complex is not uniformly localized around the cortex and can form regions of enrichment without Fat2. We also saw that Sra1-GFP enrichment coincided with the presence of F-actin protrusions (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6A</xref>), indicating that the WAVE complex in these regions is active. To confirm that the WAVE complex builds the protrusions in <italic>fat2</italic> epithelia, we co-imaged Sra1-GFP and a membrane label, and found that Sra1-GFP was enriched at the tips of membrane protrusions (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6s1">Figure 6—figure supplement 1</xref>; <xref ref-type="video" rid="fig6video1">Figure 6—video 1</xref>).

It is not known whether Fat2 contributes to the stabilization of protrusive regions in addition to positioning them. If so, the positions of WAVE complex-enriched, protrusive regions of <italic>fat2</italic> epithelia should fluctuate more than those of control epithelia, in addition to being less well-polarized at the tissue level. To see if this is the case, we acquired timelapse movies of Sra1-GFP and monitored its distribution along cell perimeters over time. In control epithelia, Sra1-GFP was strongly enriched along leading-trailing interfaces relative to side interfaces over the 20-min timelapse. Side interfaces were mostly devoid of Sra1-GFP, except for infrequent Sra1-GFP accumulations that persisted for several minutes (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6B–D</xref>; <xref ref-type="video" rid="fig6video2">Figure 6—video 2</xref>). In contrast, in <italic>fat2</italic> epithelia, the regions of greatest Sra1-GFP enrichment along the cell perimeter changed substantially over the 20-min timelapse and multiple Sra1-GFP-enriched regions were often present simultaneously in individual <italic>fat2</italic> cells. Sra1-GFP accumulated in these regions, typically spreading outward along the membrane as it did so, and then dissipated. These events had a duration that was comparable to the transient accumulations of Sra1-GFP at side interfaces in control cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6B–D</xref>; <xref ref-type="video" rid="fig6video2">Figure 6—video 2</xref>). Because all cell-cell interfaces in <italic>fat2</italic> epithelia and side interfaces in control epithelia lack Fat2, this suggests a several-minutes timescale over which regions of WAVE complex enrichment can persist without stabilization by Fat2. Live imaging of Sra1-GFP in <italic>fat2</italic> mosaic epithelia yielded similar information—Sra1-GFP enrichment fluctuated more at interfaces between <italic>fat2</italic> cells than interfaces between control cells despite both being in a migratory tissue (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6E and F</xref>; <xref ref-type="video" rid="fig6video3">Figure 6—video 3</xref>).</p><p>To see if Fat2’s role stabilizing the WAVE complex distribution translates to a role stabilizing protrusive regions, we returned to our timelapse movies of membrane protrusions in control and <italic>fat2</italic> epithelia, this time focusing on the protrusions’ dynamics rather than their distribution. In control cells, protrusion polarity appeared largely stable over the 20-min duration of our timelapse movies, whereas in <italic>fat2</italic> cells it often shifted substantially. In some <italic>fat2</italic> epithelia, protrusion positions shifts were largely restricted to two opposite-facing cell edges, whereas in others, protrusions positions shifted seemingly at random (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7A</xref>, <xref ref-type="video" rid="fig7video1">Figure 7—video 1</xref>). To evaluate the stability of protrusion polarity quantitatively, we measured the frequency of interface protrusion polarity ‘switches’, in which first one cell and then its neighbor protruded across their shared interface (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7B</xref>). These events were rare in control epithelia, with ∼2% of interfaces switching polarity per hour. In contrast, they were more common in <italic>fat2</italic> epithelia, with ∼60% of interfaces switching polarity per hour (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7C</xref>). Together, these observations show that, in addition to polarizing the WAVE complex and protrusive activity to the leading edge, Fat2 stabilizes their distributions for repeated cycles of protrusion from one long-lived cell region (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7D</xref>).</p><fig-group><fig id="fig7" position="float"><label>Figure 7.</label><caption><title>Fat2 stabilizes a protrusive region in each cell.</title><p>(<bold>A</bold>) Timelapse frames of control and <italic>fat2</italic> epithelia labeled with a membrane dye, showing the position of a cell’s protrusions over time.

From these data we conclude that Fat2 controls the distribution of the WAVE complex by concentrating the WAVE complex in adjacent puncta. These findings also demonstrate that the Fat2 intracellular domain is dispensable for Fat2-WAVE complex interaction in collectively migrating follicle cells.</p><p>Ena-dependent filopodia are embedded within and grow from the lamellipodia (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Cetera et al., 2014</xref>).

Labeling filopodia tips with a GFP-tagged Ena transgene (GFP-Ena) and comparing the localization of Abi-mCherry and F-actin to either GFP-Ena or to Fat2-3xGFP, we found that the sites of highest Fat2-3xGFP and Abi-mCherry enrichment coincided with filopodia tips (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8">Figure 8C, D and F</xref>; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8s1">Figure 8—figure supplement 1</xref>). Fluorescence intensity profiles along filopodia lengths showed that Fat2-3xGFP and Abi-mCherry were enriched just ahead of the F-actin-rich region (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8">Figure 8F and G</xref>). Fat2-3xGFP was shifted slightly forward from Abi-mCherry, consistent with the separation of Fat2-3xGFP and Abi-mCherry fluorophores by a cell-cell interface (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8">Figure 8F and G</xref>; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8s1">Figure 8—figure supplement 1</xref>). This analysis demonstrates a stereotyped organization in which Fat2 and the WAVE complex are concentrated with Ena near the tips of the filopodia, with Fat2 at the trailing edge across the cell-cell interface from the leading edge components (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8">Figure 8H</xref>).</p><p>We considered two explanations for the close spatial relationship between Fat2 puncta, WAVE complex puncta, and filopodia. Fat2 could recruit the WAVE complex locally to puncta, and WAVE complex puncta shape the distribution of filopodia. Alternatively, Fat2 could recruit the WAVE complex to the leading edge, but their colocalization in puncta be a secondary effect of the filopodia, perhaps caused by the known interaction between Ena and Abi (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Chen et al., 2014b</xref>) or by deformation of the leading-trailing interface. To rule out a dependence on filopodia, we measured colocalization between Fat2-3xGFP and Abi-mCherry in <italic>ena</italic>-RNAi-expressing epithelia, in which filopodia are strongly depleted (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Cetera et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1F</xref>). Despite the loss of filopodia, both Fat2-3xGFP and Abi-mCherry remained punctate, and their colocalization was only slightly reduced (Spearman’s <italic>r</italic>=0.71 ± 0.04 vs 0.65±0.03, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8s1">Figure 8—figure supplement 1</xref>,B). We therefore rule out Ena or the filopodia themselves as required mediators of the spatial relationship between Fat2 and the WAVE complex, and infer that Fat2-WAVE complex colocalization is indicative of Fat2 recruitment of the WAVE complex locally to these sites.</p><p>Altogether, we propose that Fat2 acts locally, at the scale of individual Fat2 puncta, to concentrate the WAVE complex in adjacent puncta across the cell-cell interface. Because Fat2 puncta are distributed along the trailing edge, this has the broader effect of stabilizing a region of WAVE complex enrichment at the leading edge.</p></sec></sec><sec id="s3" sec-type="discussion"><title>Discussion</title><p>This work demonstrates that a <italic>trans</italic> interaction between the atypical cadherin Fat2 and the WAVE complex can stabilize WAVE complex polarity for directed cell migration. Fat2, localized to the trailing edge of each cell, recruits the WAVE complex to the leading edge of the cell behind, just across their shared interface. By concentrating WAVE complex activity in a restricted region, Fat2 strongly biases lamellipodia and filopodia to form at these leading edge sites, stably polarizing overall cell protrusive activity to one cell side. Because the Fat2-WAVE complex signaling system is deployed at each leading-trailing interface in a planar-polarized manner, it both polarizes protrusions within individual cells and aligns these individual cell polarities across the epithelium. This allows the cells to exert force in a common direction and achieve a highly coordinated collective cell migration.</p><p>While the molecular players differ, local coupling of leading and trailing edges through asymmetric interactions across their shared interface is a recurring motif in studies of epithelial collective cell migrations. In an epithelial cell culture model of collective migration, asymmetric pulling forces across cell-cell interfaces polarize Rac1 activity and cell protrusion (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Das et al., 2015</xref>). In another model, one cell’s lamellipodium is stabilized by confinement under the trailing edge of the cell ahead, reinforcing interface asymmetry (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Jain et al., 2020</xref>). In an endothelial collective cell migration model, asymmetric membrane ‘fingers’ containing VE-cadherin extend from the trailing edge and are engulfed by the leading edge of the cell behind, whose movement they help guide (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Hayer et al., 2016</xref>). These types of leading-trailing edge coupling systems could operate together with longer-range cues to reinforce the planar polarity of cells’ migratory structures. In migrations with a closed topology and no extrinsic directional cues, such as that of the follicle cells, local polarity coupling may be especially critical for collective migration.</p><p>Our development of new computational tools to segment and quantify membrane protrusion dynamics in a collectively-migrating epithelium has led to new insights into how Fat2 regulates protrusions. We found that without Fat2, protrusivity was reduced, and the distribution of remaining protrusions expanded around the cell periphery. Therefore, Fat2 not only promotes protrusion at the leading edge, but also restricts protrusion to that edge. Analysis of <italic>fat2</italic> mosaic epithelia revealed that Fat2 acts locally to enforce this restriction—even in the context of a globally planar-polarized, migratory epithelium, cells lacking input from Fat2 in the cell ahead were unable to polarize their protrusions in the direction of migration. Although protrusions were no longer biased in one direction without Fat2, the presence of axial orientation bias in a subset of <italic>fat2</italic> epithelia indicates that some form of Fat2-independent planar polarity was still present. This could be mediated by undiscovered planar signaling molecules or by a mechanical cue such as tension transmitted between cells. Investigating the cell-cell communication that gives rise to this layer of planar polarity will be an interesting area for future research.</p><p>Excitable WAVE complex activity underlies lamellipodial protrusion (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib68">Weiner et al., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib71">Xiong et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Graziano and Weiner, 2014</xref>), and WAVE complex activity is often entrained by directional cues from the environment (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib40">Millius et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib71">Xiong et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Huang et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Hayashi et al., 2014</xref>). We hypothesize that Fat2 acts as a similar activity-entraining directional cue in follicle cells. Excitable WAVE complex dynamics were especially apparent in our data in contexts where Fat2 was absent from the cell-cell interface—either at interfaces between cells in <italic>fat2</italic> epithelia, or at protrusive side interfaces we observed with low frequency in control cells. In both contexts, the WAVE complex accumulated at an edge region, spread laterally along the membrane, and then dissipated. This corresponded with the initiation, growth, and collapse of a protrusion. Where Fat2 was present, the WAVE complex distribution along the cell perimeter stayed more constant and WAVE complex levels fluctuated in place, but did not appear to spread laterally. These findings, along with the loss of cell and tissue-scale WAVE complex polarization in the absence of Fat2, suggest that Fat2 acts by concentrating WAVE complex activity in a narrow region, thereby polarizing protrusions to a single leading edge.</p><p>How might Fat2 locally concentrate the WAVE complex? The WAVE complex is activated by recruitment to the plasma membrane (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib46">Oikawa et al., 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">Lebensohn and Kirschner, 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Chen et al., 2010</xref>). Positive regulators of WAVE complex accumulation include active Rac, phosphatidylinositol (3,4,5)-triphosphate (PIP<sub>3</sub>), membrane-localized proteins that directly bind the WAVE complex, and the WAVE complex itself (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">Miki et al., 1998</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib58">Steffen et al., 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib46">Oikawa et al., 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib53">Sossey-Alaoui et al., 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib67">Weiner et al., 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib42">Nakao et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib43">Namekata et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Graziano and Weiner, 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Chen et al., 2014a</xref>). We propose that Fat2 promotes WAVE complex accumulation within a stable region by acting through one or more of these positive regulators, thereby controlling the site where the WAVE complex excitation threshold is crossed and a protrusion is formed. Under this model, in the absence of Fat2, this site selection instead becomes more stochastic and therefore long-lasting protrusive regions cannot form. If part of the WAVE complex circuit is limiting for protrusion formation, this could also account for Fat2’s ability to suppress protrusion formation away from the leading edge. However, there are other possible suppression mechanisms. For example, in neutrophils, protrusions have been shown to increase membrane tension and thereby suppress distant protrusion, enforcing the selection of a single protrusive region (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Houk et al., 2012</xref>).</p><p>Fat2 acts at the trailing edge of each cell to recruit the WAVE complex in trans, so there must be one or more transmembrane proteins at the leading edge of each cell that bridge this interaction. Previous work has shown that the receptor tyrosine phosphatase Lar is part of this bridge—Fat2 recruits Lar to each follicle cell’s leading edge (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Barlan et al., 2017</xref>), and in Lar’s absence both WAVE complex levels and cell protrusions are reduced (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Barlan et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib55">Squarr et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8s1">Figure 8—figure supplement 1</xref>). However, the WAVE complex that persists at the leading edges of <italic>lar</italic> cells still colocalizes with Fat2 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8s1">Figure 8—figure supplement 1</xref>). Therefore, there must be at least one other transmembrane protein that works alongside Lar to mediate the Fat2-WAVE complex interaction. Identifying the missing leading edge protein(s) will be important to fully understand how Fat2 shapes WAVE complex activity.</p><p>Fat2 is localized in puncta along each cell’s trailing edge (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib65">Viktorinová and Dahmann, 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Barlan et al., 2017</xref>), and we show here that these puncta correspond 1:1 with regions of high WAVE complex enrichment just across the leading-trailing cell-cell interface. Fat2’s punctate distribution and its levels along cell-cell interfaces are unaffected by loss of the WAVE complex (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Barlan et al., 2017</xref>), indicating that Fat2 puncta shape the distribution of the WAVE complex and protrusions, not the reverse. We further show that the puncta sit at the tips of filopodia that form within the lamellipodial actin network. Filopodia are a prominent feature of the long-lived protrusive regions that form in wild-type epithelia, but appear to be disproportionately reduced in the short-lived, fluctuating protrusive regions that form in <italic>fat2</italic> epithelia. We therefore propose that by concentrating the WAVE complex and/or stabilizing its distribution, Fat2 also facilitates filopodia formation. It should be noted, however, that the filopodia are dispensable for collective follicle cell migration (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Cetera et al., 2014</xref>), so the reason these structures form remains to be determined.</p><p>Why, and how, is Fat2 localized in puncta? Cadherins commonly form puncta, though the causes and functions of this organization vary (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib62">Truong Quang et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib49">Rubinstein et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">Li et al., 2021</xref>). For example, Flamingo (or mammalian Celsr1), an atypical cadherin and central component of the core planar cell polarity pathway, is stabilized by clustering, and this clustering is important for its planar polarization (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib60">Strutt et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Cho et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib56">Stahley et al., 2021</xref>). In future work, it will be important to determine how Fat2 assembles in puncta, and whether this local clustering is important for its polarization to trailing edges or its effect on the organization of leading edges. More broadly, it will be critical to determine how Fat2 achieves its trailing edge localization, a necessary step in the polarization of the tissue.</p></sec><sec id="s4" sec-type="materials|methods"><title>Materials and methods</title><table-wrap id="keyresource" position="anchor"><label>Key resources table</label><table frame="hsides" rules="groups"><thead><tr><th align="left" valign="bottom">Reagent type (species) or resource</th><th align="left" valign="bottom">Designation</th><th align="left" valign="bottom">Source or reference</th><th align="left" valign="bottom">Identifiers</th><th align="left" valign="bottom">Additional information</th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td align="left" valign="bottom">Gene (<italic>Drosophila melanogaster</italic>)</td><td align="left" valign="bottom">Abi</td><td align="left" valign="bottom">NA</td><td align="left" valign="bottom">FLYB:FBgn0020510</td><td align="left" valign="bottom">FlyBase Name: Abelson interacting protein</td></tr><tr><td align="left" valign="bottom">Gene (<italic>Drosophila melanogaster</italic>)</td><td align="left" valign="bottom">Dlg</td><td align="left" valign="bottom">NA</td><td align="left" valign="bottom">FLYB:FBgn0001624</td><td align="left" valign="bottom">FlyBase Name: discs large 1</td></tr><tr><td align="left" valign="bottom">Gene (<italic>Drosophila melanogaster</italic>)</td><td align="left" valign="bottom">E-cadherin</td><td align="left" valign="bottom">NA</td><td align="left" valign="bottom">FLYB:FBgn0003391</td><td align="left" valign="bottom">FlyBase Name: shotgun</td></tr><tr><td align="left" valign="bottom">Gene (<italic>Drosophila melanogaster</italic>)</td><td align="left" valign="bottom">Ena</td><td align="left" valign="bottom">NA</td><td align="left" valign="bottom">FLYB:FBgn0000578</td><td align="left" valign="bottom">FlyBase Name: enabled</td></tr><tr><td align="left" valign="bottom">Gene (<italic>Drosophila melanogaster</italic>)</td><td align="left" valign="bottom">Fat2 (kug)</td><td align="left" valign="bottom">NA</td><td align="left" valign="bottom">FLYB:FBgn0261574</td><td align="left" valign="bottom">FlyBase Name: kugelei</td></tr><tr><td align="left" valign="bottom">Gene (<italic>Drosophila melanogaster</italic>)</td><td align="left" valign="bottom">Lar</td><td align="left" valign="bottom">NA</td><td align="left" valign="bottom">FLYB:FBgn0000464</td><td align="left" valign="bottom">FlyBase Name: Leukocyte-antigen- related-like</td></tr><tr><td align="left" valign="bottom">Gene (<italic>Drosophila melanogaster</italic>)</td><td align="left" valign="bottom">Scar</td><td align="left" valign="bottom">NA</td><td align="left" valign="bottom">FLYB:FBgn0041781</td><td align="left" valign="bottom">FlyBase Name: SCAR</td></tr><tr><td align="left" valign="bottom">Gene (<italic>Drosophila melanogaster</italic>)</td><td align="left" valign="bottom">Sra1 (CYFIP)</td><td align="left" valign="bottom">NA</td><td align="left" valign="bottom">FLYB:FBgn0038320</td><td align="left" valign="bottom">FlyBase Name: Cytoplasmic FMR1 interacting protein</td></tr><tr><td align="left" valign="bottom">Genetic reagent (<italic>Drosophila melanogaster</italic>)</td><td align="left" valign="bottom">Abi-mCherry or ubi &gt;Abi-mCherry</td><td align="left" valign="bottom">Bloomington <italic>Drosophila</italic> Stock Center; FLYB:FBrf0227194 (S.

GFP was amplified from the pTWG plasmid. A linker with sequence encoding the amino acids ‘GSGGSGGS’ was added to the N-terminal side of GFP. Homology arms, linker, and GFP were inserted into donor plasmid pDsRed-attP, which contains 3xP3 &gt;DsRed flanked by loxP sites for insertion screening and subsequent removal. The linker-GFP insertion was made immediately before the Sra1 stop codon. Guide and homologous recombination plasmids were injected by Genetivision Inc into the nanos &gt;Cas9 background.

To obtain these, ovaries were dissected into live imaging media (Schneider’s <italic>Drosophila</italic> medium with 15% fetal bovine serum and 200 μg/mL insulin) in a spot plate using 1 set of Dumont #55 forceps and 1 set of Dumont #5 forceps. Ovarioles were removed from the ovary and from ovariole muscle sheathes with forceps. For live imaging, egg chambers older than the egg chamber to be imaged were removed from the ovariole strands by cutting through the stalk with a 27-gauge hypodermic needle. For fixed imaging, egg chambers older than stage 9 were removed prior to fixation. Removal of older egg chambers allows more compression of the imaged egg chamber between the slide and coverslip so that the basal surface of a field of cells can be imaged in a single plane.

For membrane staining, CellMask Orange or Deep Red plasma membrane stain (Thermo Fisher Scientific, Waltham, MA, 1:500) was added and ovarioles incubated for 15 min, followed by a wash in live imaging media to remove excess stain before mounting. Ovarioles were then transferred to a glass slide with 20 μL of live imaging media. For CK-666 treatment, following plasma membrane staining, ovarioles were transferred to live imaging media with 750 μM CK-666 (Millipore Sigma, St. Louis, MO) and then mounted in the same media. Glass beads with diameter 51 μm were added to support the 22x22 mm #1.5 coverslip and limit egg chamber compression. Coverslip edges were sealed with melted petroleum jelly to prevent evaporation while imaging. Samples were checked for damage using the membrane stain or other fluorescent markers as indicators, and excluded if damage was observed. Slides were used for no more than 1 hr.</p></sec><sec id="s4-6"><title>Immunostaining and F-actin staining</title><p>Following dissection, ovarioles were fixed in 4% EM-grade formaldehyde in PBT (phosphate buffered saline +0.1% Triton X-100) and then washed 3x5 min in PBT at room temperature. Egg chambers were incubated with primary antibodies in PBT overnight at 4° C (anti-Scar, 1:200) or for 2 hr at room temperature (anti-Discs Large, 1:20) while rocking. Ovarioles were then washed 3x5 min in PBT and incubated in secondary antibody diluted 1:200 in PBT for 2 hr at room temperature while rocking. F-actin staining was performed using either TRITC phalloidin (Millipore Sigma, 1:250) or Alexa Fluor 647 phalloidin (Thermo Fisher Scientific, 1:50). If TRITC phalloidin was the only stain or antibody used, it was added directly to the fixation media for 15 min of staining concurrent with fixation. Otherwise, TRITC phalloidin was added for 15–30 min at room temperature as the final staining step. Alexa Fluor 647 phalloidin staining was performed for 2 hr at room temperature while the sample was rocking, concurrent with secondary antibody staining where applicable. Ovarioles were then washed 3x5 min in PBT and mounted in 40 μL SlowFade Diamond antifade on a slide using a 22x50 mm #1.5 coverslip, sealed with nail polish, and stored at 4° C until imaged.</p></sec><sec id="s4-7"><title>Microscopy</title><sec id="s4-7-1"><title>Laser scanning confocal microscopy</title><p>Laser scanning confocal microscopy was used for all fixed imaging and for live imaging of membrane-dyed egg chambers.

First, each cell was segmented and tracked, with manual corrections to cell-cell interface placements made using napari (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib44">napari contributors, 2019</xref> ). Next, a watershed-based approach was used to segment the regions of high fluorescence intensity at the interface of each pair of neighboring cells. This segmented shape encompasses the cell-cell interface and any associated protrusions from either neighboring cell. Last, to assign protrusions to the cell from which they originated, the segmented region was divided in two by the shortest path between its bounding vertices that lay entirely within the region. This approximates the position of the interface between the cells, and in subsequent steps we will call this line ‘the interface’. Each of the two resulting protrusion shapes was assigned as originating from the cell on the opposite side of the interface, because protrusions extend from one cell and overlap the other. Using this approach, all of the protrusive structures that emerge from one cell, and that overlap a single neighboring cell, are grouped together as a single segmented region for subsequent analysis.</p></sec><sec id="s4-9"><title>Measurement of membrane protrusivity, protrusion length, and protrusion orientation</title><p>After cell edges and associated protrusions were segmented, they were categorized as either protrusive or non-protrusive and their lengths and orientations using Python scikit-fmm, scikit-image, and scipy libraries. We use the term ‘membrane extensions’ to refer to the cell edge shapes before the protrusive ones have been identified. To measure the length of a membrane extension, we used two different metrics, each of which provides a single length value per cell edge. In one, we calculated the ‘average length’ of a membrane extension as the membrane extension’s area divided by the length of the interface it extended across. As an alternate length measurement, we calculated its ‘longest length’. To do so, we first found its ‘tip’, defined as the pixel within the segmented region farthest from any point along the interface. We then found its ‘base’, the pixel along the interface that was closest to the tip. We defined membrane extension longest length as the length of the shortest path between base and tip that lay entirely within the membrane extension. To categorize membrane extensions as <italic>protrusive</italic> or <italic>non-protrusive</italic> throughout the study, we used the ‘average length’ metric. We measured the average length distribution in CK-666-treated epithelia, which are nearly non-protrusive and so provided a measure of the width of the cell-cell interface alone. For all conditions, we categorized a membrane extension as protrusive if its average length was greater than the 98<sup>th</sup> percentile of length of CK-666-treated epithelia. We then defined the protrusivity of an entire epithelium as the ratio of protrusive to total cell edges in the field of view. We also report two alternate measurements of the protrusivity of an epithelium. In one, We calculate epithelial protrusivity as above, but substitute the longest length as our length measurement (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s1">Figure 3—figure supplement 1A</xref>). In a second, cutoff-independent epithelial protrusivity measurement, we report the epithelium-mean average membrane extension length (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s1">Figure 3—figure supplement 1B</xref>). Swarm plots of each of these analyses were generated using GraphPad Prism 9 (GraphPad, San Diego, CA), as were all other swarm plots.</p><p>For analysis of protrusion orientation, we included only the membrane extensions categorized as protrusive according to the ‘average length’ metric. We defined a protrusion’s orientation as the orientation of the vector from its base to its tip. Polar histograms, generated in Python with matplotlib (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Hunter, 2007</xref>), show the distribution of protrusion orientations. In these plots, bar area is proportional to the number of protrusions in the corresponding bin. We note that cells of migratory epithelia often have rearward-pointing retraction fibers as well as protrusions, and our protrusion segmentation method does not distinguish these two types of membrane extensions. For this reason, the degree of protrusion polarity we measure for the migratory control epithelia is likely an underestimate.</p></sec><sec id="s4-10"><title>Quantification of F-actin and Sra1-GFP cell-cell interface and non-interface basal surface fluorescence</title><p>Cells and cell-cell interfaces were segmented as described above. Cells and interfaces in contact with the tissue border or image border were excluded from analysis. For interface fluorescence intensity, interfaces were dilated by 5 pixels, and mean fluorescence intensity calculated from within this region. Non-interface basal surface fluorescence intensity was calculated as the mean of the remaining (non-interface) tissue surface. For F-actin cell-cell interface enrichment measurements, the overall brightness of the phalloidin staining varied between epithelia independent of genotype. To control for this variation we subtracted the mean intensity of the epithelium’s non-interface basal surface from its mean interface intensity measurement. This value, the degree of F-actin interface enrichment, was used as a proxy for F-actin protrusivity.</p></sec><sec id="s4-11"><title>Quantification of F-actin and Sra1-GFP planar polarity</title><p>As a simple planar polarity measurement, we quantified mean F-actin (phalloidin) or Sra1-GFP fluorescence intensity along each cell-cell interface as a function of the interface’s orientation with respect to the anterior-posterior axis. To do this, cells and cell-cell interfaces were segmented as described above. For interface angle measurements, the angular distance between the line defined by the interface-bounding vertices and the anterior-posterior (horizontal) axis was calculated. For interface fluorescence intensity measurements, interface regions were identified as segmented interfaces dilated by 5 pixels. Vertices, dilated by 10 pixels, were excluded from interface regions. Mean fluorescence intensity was calculated within each interface region, and background (the mean non-interface basal surface fluorescence intensity of all cells in the image) was subtracted. Polar bar plots, generated in Python with matplotlib, show the mean interface intensity as a function of interface angle. In these plots, bar area is proportional to intensity, and Control and <italic>fat2</italic> datasets are rescaled separately so that each have a mean value of one. As a summary statistic for the degree of planar polarization of F-actin or Sra1-GFP in each egg chamber, we found the average fluorescence intensities of interfaces with angles between 0° and 10° and between 80° and 90°. These correspond with leading-trailing and side interfaces, respectively, in migratory epithelia. The <italic>leading-trailing interface enrichment</italic> is the ratio of these numbers.</p></sec><sec id="s4-12"><title>Autonomy analysis in mosaic epithelia</title><p>Egg chambers were stained with Alexa Fluor 647 phalloidin to mark protrusions, which indicate migration direction, and to determine whether egg chambers were planar-polarized. We analyzed only S6-7 egg chambers with mixtures of control and <italic>fat2</italic> cells that had global stress fiber alignment orthogonal to the anterior-posterior axis, indicating global planar polarity. Since migration is required to maintain planar polarity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Cetera et al., 2014</xref>), this also indicates that the epithelium was migratory. We then measured the Sra1-GFP fluorescence intensity at leading-trailing interfaces and medial basal surfaces to determine whether changes in Sra1-GFP levels coincided with the genotype of the Sra1-containing cell, or the genotype of the cell ahead. To select leading-trailing interface regions to measure, we drew 10 pixel-wide segmented lines along leading edges of individual cells, assigning them to a condition based on their own genotype and the genotype of the cell just ahead. If a cell had both control and <italic>fat2</italic> cells ahead of it, we measured those leading edge segments separately, assigning each to the applicable condition. Lines were drawn along all visible, in-focus <italic>fat2</italic>-control and control-<italic>fat2</italic> boundaries and a similar number of control-control and <italic>fat2-fat2</italic> boundaries. Epithelia were excluded if two or more interfaces of each of the four genotype combinations were not present. From these regions, we measured mean Sra1-GFP fluorescence intensity for each cell, and then took the mean of these as the fluorescence intensity per egg chamber. For a diagram of this method, see <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Barlan et al., 2017</xref>, which we have modified here to allow measurement of individual cells. To quantify medial basal surface Sra1-GFP fluorescence intensity, we used the same approach with the following exceptions: we measured polygonal regions of the basal surface of individual cells away from cell-cell interfaces, and cells were excluded if their leading edge contacted both control and <italic>fat2</italic> cells.</p></sec><sec id="s4-13"><title>Quantification of migration rate</title><p>Egg chambers were dissected, dyed with CellMask Orange, and mounted for live imaging as described above. Several ovarioles were mounted on each slide, with each ovariole terminating in a S6-7 egg chamber. Timelapse imaging was performed for 30 min with frames acquired every 30 s. Multi-point acquisition was used to obtain movies of up to 5 egg chambers simultaneously. To generate a kymograph, a line was drawn along the axis of migration at the center of the anterior-posterior egg chamber axis in Fiji. In these kymographs, cell-cell interfaces are visible as lines, and their slope gives a measurement of cell migration rate. Egg chamber migration rates were calculated from the average of four-cell interface slopes from each kymograph. Egg chambers that clearly slowed down over the course of the timelapse, visible as curvature in the interface lines in the kymographs, were excluded. For an illustration of this method, see <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Barlan et al., 2017</xref>.</p></sec><sec id="s4-14"><title>Cell perimeter kymograph generation and interpretation</title><p>To visualize the distribution of Sra1-GFP along cell-cell interfaces over time, we generated kymographs of cell perimeters from timelapses of Sra1-GFP-expressing epithelia obtained using near-TIRF microscopy. Perimeters were drawn manually in Fiji in each frame with the pencil tool, and then these perimeters were used to generate kymographs in Python. Perimeters were thinned to 1 pixel and then perimeter pixels were sequenced with Python scikit-image and scipy libraries. Kymographs were generated with matplotlib. Kymograph rows were constructed by linearizing the perimeters from each frame, starting with the pixel directly above the cell centroid (the center of the trailing edge in control cells) and continuing counter-clockwise. Each row shows the fluorescence intensity of the perimeter pixels in sequence. Cell perimeter lengths varied between frames, so kymograph row lengths varied and were aligned to their center position.</p><p>At the spatial and temporal resolution of the timelapses and corresponding kymographs, we cannot evaluate differences in the dynamics the puncta-scale WAVE complex accumulations highlighted in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8">Figure 8</xref>. Instead, we focus on the ‘region’-scale distribution of Sra1-GFP, and the stability of that distribution over time. The regions we refer to here are approximately the length of a cell-cell interface, with variation. Because the kymographs are generated from epithelia in which all cells express Sra1-GFP, we need additional information to identify the cell to which a region of Sra1-GFP enrichment belongs. We infer that Sra1-GFP is predominantly at leading edges in polarized, migratory epithelia based on the Sra1-GFP distribution in epithelia with mosaic Sra1-GFP expression (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5B</xref>). Based on consistent correlation between Sra1-GFP enrichment and the presence of protrusions (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6A</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6s1">Figure 6—figure supplement 1</xref>), and its known role building lamellipodia as part of the WAVE complex (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">Miki et al., 1998</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">Miki et al., 2000</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib58">Steffen et al., 2004</xref>), we also infer that regions of Sra1-GFP enrichment belong to the cell that is protruding outward regardless of genotype. Our interpretations of Sra1-GFP enrichment patterns in movies and corresponding kymographs are made with these assumptions.</p></sec><sec id="s4-15"><title>Quantification of the stability of interface protrusion polarity</title><p>As a measurement of the stability of protrusive regions over time, we quantified the frequency with which the direction of protrusion switched across a cell-cell interface. These switching events occur when one cell and then its neighbor protrude across their shared interface, and they serve as a score-able indicator of a change in the polarity state of the cells that bound the interface. To determine the switching frequency, we counted the number of switching events that occurred in each timelapse, and then determined an interface protrusion polarity switching rate by dividing the number of switches by the number of interfaces identified with cell and protrusion segmentation. We chose a hand-counting method because the protrusion segmentation error rate from the inclusion of retraction fibers and other sources (see Measurement of membrane protrusivity, protrusion length, and protrusion orientation) was sufficiently high that automated measurement of dynamic features of protrusions was unreliable.</p></sec><sec id="s4-16"><title>Colocalization of proteins along the leading-trailing interface</title><p>Data used for colocalization analysis were collected with 63 x/1.4 NA Plan-APOCHROMAT oil immersion objective to minimize chromatic aberration. Linescans were generated in Fiji by manually drawing a 10 pixel-wide segmented line along rows of leading-trailing interfaces at the follicle cell basal surface. At least 20 leading-trailing interfaces were included per egg chamber. For the Fat2<sup>ΔICD</sup> condition, in which the distribution of Fat2 expands beyond leading-trailing interfaces, we measured colocalization either along randomly oriented interfaces (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8">Figure 8E</xref>) or leading-trailing interfaces (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8s1">Figure 8—figure supplement 1</xref>) and obtained very similar results. Fluorescence intensities along the linescans were obtained with the PlotProfile function, which averages pixel intensities along the width of the line and reports a list of averaged values along the line’s length. Spearman’s correlation coefficients were calculated for each egg chamber in Python with the scipy.stats module. Failure to exactly follow leading-trailing interfaces and cusps in the segmented lines will artificially inflate the measured correlation, so we used correlation between E-cadherin-GFP (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Huang et al., 2009</xref>) and Abi-mCherry as a negative control that is also subject to this inflation. Abi-mCherry and E-cadherin-GFP are slightly displaced from each other (anticorrelated) along the length of protrusions (the width of the linescans), but averaging across the line width collapses this displacement, resulting in measured intensity signals that are roughly uncorrelated. Spearman’s correlation coefficients ± standard deviation are reported in the text. Linescans of leading-trailing interfaces were plotted using the fluorescence intensities from along the leading-trailing interfaces of two cells. Intensities from each fluorophore were rescaled between 0 and 1 and plotted with matplotlib in Python.</p></sec><sec id="s4-17"><title>Protrusion profile generation</title><p>Viewing only the F-actin channel in Fiji, we drew 1 pixel-wide lines down the length of F-actin bundles at the leading edge. Fluorescence intensities along these lines were obtained for all fluorophores with the Fiji PlotProfile function. In Python, these traces were aligned to the pixel with highest Fat2-3xGFP or Ena-GFP intensity (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8">Figure 8G</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8s1">Figure 8—figure supplement 1</xref>). To calculate standard deviation, all traces were first rescaled individually so that their values ranged between 0 and 1. To plot ‘protrusion profiles’, the mean fluorescence was determined for each fluorophore at each pixel position, and then average values were rescaled between 0 and 1. Plots of protrusion profiles were generated with matplotlib.</p></sec><sec id="s4-18"><title>Movie generation</title><p>Migration motion was subtracted from several timelapse movies of migratory cells or epithelia for ease of visualization.

These were encoded as 1080 p30 .mp4 files with H.264 (x264) video encoder using HandBrake 1.4.</p></sec><sec id="s4-19"><title>Reproducibility and statistical analysis</title><p>Visibly damaged egg chambers were excluded from all analyses. At least two biological replicates were performed for each experiment, and results confirmed to be qualitatively consistent. Each biological replicate included egg chambers pooled from multiple flies. Experiments and analysis were not randomized or performed blinded. Sample sizes were not predetermined using a statistical method. The number of biological replicates (n), statistical tests performed, and their significance can be found in figures or figure legends. Based on visual inspection, all data on which statistical tests were performed followed an approximately normal distribution, so tests assuming normalcy were used. Alpha was set to 0.05 for all statistical tests. Paired statistical tests were used for comparisons of cells of different genetic conditions within mosaic epithelia. All t-tests were two-tailed. One-sample t-tests were used when comparing a distribution of ratios to a null expectation of one. A one-way ANOVA was used when more than two conditions were compared. Welch’s corrections were performed for the t-tests or ANOVAs of data plotted in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3C</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7C</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s1">Figure 3—figure supplement 1A,B</xref>, and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s2">Figure 3—figure supplement 2</xref>, for which the variance did not appear consistent between conditions. For post-hoc comparison tests, all pairs of conditions present in the corresponding plot were compared using post-hoc Tukey’s multiple comparisons test with the following exceptions: the data plotted in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8">Figure 8E</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8s1">Figure 8—figure supplement 1</xref> were analyzed together, and all conditions were compared to Fat2-Abi and E-cadherin-Abi only, and in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5s2">Figure 5—figure supplement 2</xref> only data from the same region (total, interface, or non-interface) was compared. For these, Šidák’s multiple comparisons tests were used. For Welch’s ANOVA, Dunnet’s T3 multiple comparisons tests were used. p-values reported for all post-hoc tests were adjusted for multiple comparisons. All statistical tests except for the calculation of Spearman’s correlation coefficients were performed in GraphPad Prism 9.</p></sec></sec></body><back><sec sec-type="additional-information" id="s5"><title>Additional information</title><fn-group content-type="competing-interest"><title>Competing interests</title><fn fn-type="COI-statement" id="conf1"><p>No competing interests declared</p></fn><fn fn-type="COI-statement" id="conf2"><p>No competing interests declared</p></fn></fn-group><fn-group content-type="author-contribution"><title>Author contributions</title><fn fn-type="con" id="con1"><p>Conceptualization, Data curation, Software, Formal analysis, Investigation, Visualization, Methodology, Writing – original draft, Writing – review and editing</p></fn><fn fn-type="con" id="con2"><p>Conceptualization, Software, Formal analysis, Methodology, Writing – review and editing</p></fn><fn fn-type="con" id="con3"><p>Conceptualization, Writing – review and editing</p></fn><fn fn-type="con" id="con4"><p>Conceptualization, Supervision, Funding acquisition, Writing – original draft, Writing – review and editing</p></fn></fn-group></sec><sec sec-type="supplementary-material" id="s6"><title>Additional files</title><supplementary-material id="transrepform"><label>Transparent reporting form</label><media xlink:href="elife-78343-transrepform1-v2.pdf" mimetype="application" mime-subtype="pdf"/></supplementary-material></sec><sec sec-type="data-availability" id="s7"><title>Data availability</title><p>The code necessary to reproduce core aspects of data analysis, along with numerical data not included in source data files, are available at <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://github.com/a9w/Fat2_polarizes_WAVE">https://github.com/a9w/Fat2_polarizes_WAVE</ext-link> (Williams and Donoughe, 2022).

Your article has been reviewed by 3 peer reviewers, including Derek Applewhite as Reviewing Editor and Reviewer #1, and the evaluation has been overseen by a Reviewing Editor and Jonathan Cooper as the Senior Editor.</p><p>The reviewers have discussed their reviews with one another, and the Reviewing Editor has drafted this to help you prepare a revised submission.</p><p>Essential revisions:</p><p>Broader/Mechanistic Comments:</p><p>A. How does Fat2 restrict WAVE activity in the trailing cell?</p><p>1. To test whether the proposed sequestration-based mechanism is feasible, quantitative imaging of the amount of WAVE recruitment to the membrane in wildtype cells adjacent to Fat2-perturbed vs control cells should be performed. Hypomorphs of WAVE complex with or without Fat2 perturbations would also be valuable if the authors are proposing sequestration.</p><p>2. Beyond sequestration of WAVE, another perhaps more likely scenario is that Fat2 alters the polarity of WAVE complex regulators such as PIP3 and active Rac. Examining the spatial dynamics of these molecules in addition the WAVE complex is the single addition that would most significantly strengthen the work. Probing these signaling nodes would have the additional benefit of revealing whether Fat2 has inputs to the trailing cell beyond the WAVE complex. This could be tested by analyzing these biosensors in WAVE complex null cells adjacent to control or Fat2 deficient cells.</p><p>B. What is nature of Fat2 coupling to WAVE/protrusions?</p><p>1.The colocalization of Fat2 versus WAVE is such an important point for this paper, it would be useful to firmly establish this relation. It would be helpful to show supplemental data normalizing Fat2 and WAVE to membrane or Cadherin to ensure their distributions reflect true enrichment rather than cell morphology. This seems to be the case, but it would be helpful to confirm.</p><p>Specific Comments:</p><p>(1) In general the N for some of the experiments seem low. I understand how difficult these experiments are to perform but some of the findings could be strengthened by more experiments. In Figure 2C, I'm a little concerned about the differences in sample size per condition. Sampling at least 5 egg chambers for the CK-666 treatment would make these data stronger. Additionally, Figure 2C shows the ratio of protrusive/total edges, but it would be helpful to include the total number of protrusive edges in each condition.</p><p>(2) The manuscript is short, but there was also more supplemental figures than full figures. Supplemental figures in general are not given as much weight so the impact of this story (which I think is potentially profound) is somewhat lost. Re-organization of figures would greatly strengthen the manuscript.</p><p>3) In the cases of Figure 4D and S7, which are looking at the stability of Sra1 localization, one way to quantify this could be by measuring the Pearson correlation of Sra1-3xGFP intensity between each frame of the timelapse image of the interface to the first frame. Stable Sra1-3xGFP enrichment will result in this correlation to remain relatively strong throughout time. However, unstable or transient Sra1-3xGFP will result in a dramatic decrease in correlation over time.</p><p>4) In the case of Figure 4E, cell edges could be tracked over time and stability of orientation can shown by the difference in the angle of protrusion formed at that edge between time points or some appropriate time window. Cell edges with stable protrusions would have small differences in angle over time, whereas edges with unstable protrusions will have large differences in angle.</p></body></sub-article><sub-article article-type="reply" id="sa2"><front-stub><article-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.78343.sa2</article-id><title-group><article-title>Author response</article-title></title-group></front-stub><body><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Essential revisions:</p><p>Broader/Mechanistic Comments:</p><p>A.

WAVE levels are reduced at the leading edges of cells directly behind <italic>fat2</italic> mutant cells, regardless of the cells’ own genotype (former Figure 3E, now 5E).</p><p>We also considered that the request might refer to WAVE levels at the medial basal surface, where WAVE could redistribute if no longer recruited to the leading edge. Our original manuscript showed this analysis for <italic>fat2</italic> and wild-type cells, but did not include cells at clone boundaries because the small number of these cells makes it challenging to detect subtle changes in fluorescence intensity. Originally, we found a slight increase in WAVE levels at the medial basal region of <italic>fat2</italic> cells relative to wild-type ones, consistent with a broadening of the WAVE distribution in the absence of Fat2 (former Figure 3F, now Figure 5F). We have now measured more clones so that we can make paired comparisons of WAVE levels at the medial basal surface of cells at the clone boundaries (see diagram in Figure 5S2G), and found no significant change in WAVE levels between genotypes in these cells. With the expanded dataset, we also no longer detected significant differences in WAVE levels in wild-type or <italic>fat2</italic> cells away from genotype boundaries (formerly p=0.02, now p=0.08). We have updated Figure 5F and the associated results text (lines 186-196) and added Figure 5S2G to reflect these changes.</p><p>Our data make a strong case that Fat2 at the back of one cell recruits the WAVE complex to the leading edge of the cell behind to form a long-lived protrusive domain. However, whether this behavior is also sufficient to suppress protrusions from forming elsewhere along the cell perimeter is not clear. There was one line in the Discussion section of the original manuscript suggesting that Fat2 might sequester WAVE away from other sites. We have expanded this paragraph to include other ways in which protrusions could be suppressed at a distance (lines 371-375).</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Hypomorphs of WAVE complex with or without Fat2 perturbations would also be valuable if the authors are proposing sequestration.</p></disp-quote><p>We were initially unsure of the rationale for this request and asked for clarification from Dr. Applewhite, who provided this additional explanation from an anonymous reviewer:</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>The authors are proposing that Fat2 limits protrusion formation in adjacent cells through WAVE complex sequestration. Under this model, the increased protrusion formation that accompanies loss of Fat2 is a consequence of the increased cytosolic pool of WAVE complex. So if Fat2 normally sequesters say 50% of the WAVE complex, then a WAVE complex heterozygote (loss of 50% of protein) should rescue the enhanced protrusion elicited by loss of Fat2. In contrast, if Fat2 is playing a role in regulating cell polarity beyond WAVE sequestration, then adjusting the WAVE dose to compensate for the amount normally recruited to Fat2 should have no effect.</p></disp-quote><p>As noted in point 1, the manuscript has been modified to no longer propose a sequestration based mechanism. It should also be noted that, although the WAVE complex and protrusions are more widely distributed around the basal cell perimeter in the absence of Fat2, their overall levels are reduced when compared to the wild-type condition, not increased (Figures 3A-C, 5S2C). Given this relationship, further reducing WAVE levels in <italic>fat2</italic> mutant epithelia seems unlikely to shed light on Fat2’s mechanism of action.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>2. Beyond sequestration of WAVE, another perhaps more likely scenario is that Fat2 alters the polarity of WAVE complex regulators such as PIP3 and active Rac. Examining the spatial dynamics of these molecules in addition the WAVE complex is the single addition that would most significantly strengthen the work. Probing these signaling nodes would have the additional benefit of revealing whether Fat2 has inputs to the trailing cell beyond the WAVE complex. This could be tested by analyzing these biosensors in WAVE complex null cells adjacent to control or Fat2 deficient cells.</p></disp-quote><p>We agree that Fat2 could act more directly on PIP3 or Rac nodes of the lamellipodia circuit, and thereby polarize WAVE, and we appreciate the reviewer’s suggestion to delve into this. To evaluate Rac polarization, we imaged the FRET sensor reported by the Montell lab (doi:10.1038/ncb2061, BDSC:32050), expressed either in all follicle cells or mosaically, allowing us to distinguish leading edge signal from that of the adjacent trailing edge. We measured the FRET ratio using the approach described here: (doi:10.1038/nprot.2011.395) after seeking advice from a senior postdoc in the Montell lab. However, we were unable to detect any FRET signal polarization. We likewise looked for polarized PI(3,4,5)P3 using a Grp1-PH-based probe (tubP&gt;GFP-Grp1-PH: BDSC8163), but were again unable to detect polarized signal—in this case the probe had the same distribution as a plasma membrane label. Unfortunately, these are the only two biosensors that are currently readily available for <italic>Drosophila</italic>. We think it is highly likely that active Rac and PIP3 are polarized in this system, but we are unable to confirm this or test the role of Fat2 in that polarization with the accessible tools.</p><p>Our initial submission included a paragraph in the Discussion noting the possibility that Fat2 could act through Rac or PIP3, but this came late in the manuscript. We have now modified our Results section to emphasize that we are using WAVE complex localization as a readout for the entire circuit (lines 156-161).</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>B. What is nature of Fat2 coupling to WAVE/protrusions?</p><p>1.The colocalization of Fat2 versus WAVE is such an important point for this paper, it would be useful to firmly establish this relation. It would be helpful to show supplemental data normalizing Fat2 and WAVE to membrane or Cadherin to ensure their distributions reflect true enrichment rather than cell morphology. This seems to be the case, but it would be helpful to confirm.</p></disp-quote><p>To control for effects of morphology on the apparent colocalization between Fat2 and WAVE, we measured the colocalization between Abi-mCherry and E-cadherin-GFP, which is near-uniformly distributed along interfaces. Abi and E-cadherin show a positive Spearman’s correlation, indicating that interface morphology may contribute to positive Fat2-WAVE correlation (Figure 8S1B). But the correlation between Fat2 and the WAVE complex is significantly higher than this negative control in all backgrounds we measured, showing that Fat2 and WAVE do colocalize (Figure 8S1B). These data were present in our original submission, but we only discussed them as a control for our region selection method. We have now added text in the Results section stating that these data also serve as a control for cell morphology (lines 261-262).</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Specific Comments:</p><p>1) In general the N for some of the experiments seem low. I understand how difficult these experiments are to perform but some of the findings could be strengthened by more experiments. In Figure 2C, I'm a little concerned about the differences in sample size per condition.

The table is referenced in the legend of Figure 2C (now Figure 3C).</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>2) The manuscript is short, but there was also more supplemental figures than full figures. Supplemental figures in general are not given as much weight so the impact of this story (which I think is potentially profound) is somewhat lost. Re-organization of figures would greatly strengthen the manuscript.</p></disp-quote><p>We have reorganized the manuscript so that data from 3 formerly supplemental figures are now included in the main figures (current Figures 2,4,6EF). There are now a total of 8 main figures and 6 supplemental figures (formerly 5 main, 9 supplemental).</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>3) In the cases of Figure 4D and S7, which are looking at the stability of Sra1 localization, one way to quantify this could be by measuring the Pearson correlation of Sra1-3xGFP intensity between each frame of the timelapse image of the interface to the first frame. Stable Sra1-3xGFP enrichment will result in this correlation to remain relatively strong throughout time. However, unstable or transient Sra1-3xGFP will result in a dramatic decrease in correlation over time.</p></disp-quote><p>We agree that quantification of Sra1 dynamics would strengthen the manuscript. However, the migratory state of the tissue confounds many measurements of these types of subcellular dynamics. Because the entire tissue is migrating in control, but not <italic>fat2</italic>, epithelia, we cannot use simple intensity correlation over time to compare Sra1 subcellular dynamics. We attempted to register the migrating cells to isolate the contribution of within-cell Sra1 distribution changes, but control cells still tend to deform more over time, so this didn’t fully remove the confound. As an imperfect stand-in for quantification, we have included a video showing Sra1 dynamics in a field of control and <italic>fat2</italic> cells, allowing the reader to assess the generality of <italic>fat2</italic> domain fluctuations among tens of cells in a shared epithelium. We have also added a quantification of membrane protrusion stability (see point 9). Sites of Sra1 enrichment correspond closely with sites of membrane protrusion (see Figures 6A, 6S1), so we can strongly infer that the Sra1 distribution is reflected in the membrane protrusion distribution.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>4) In the case of Figure 4E, cell edges could be tracked over time and stability of orientation can shown by the difference in the angle of protrusion formed at that edge between time points or some appropriate time window. Cell edges with stable protrusions would have small differences in angle over time, whereas edges with unstable protrusions will have large differences in angle.</p></disp-quote><p>We have now added a measurement of the stability of membrane protrusion distribution, in which we quantify the frequency of events in which the direction of protrusion from an individual interface switches. We chose this measurement because, as a binary event, it was more readily score-able than the related quantity of changes in net cell polarity exemplified in Figure 7A. The frequency of polarity switches per interface per hour was significantly higher in <italic>fat2</italic> epithelia than controls (Welch’s t-test, p=0.0002). These data are now plotted in Figure 7C with an accompanying example of a switching event in Figure 7B.</p><p>Ideally, we would have used our membrane protrusion segmentation and polarity data as a starting point for measuring protrusion stability. However, although the segmentation was reliable enough to detect a bias in protrusion polarity shown in the rose plots, there are errors. These errors have an outsized impact on measurements of traits with a time dimension like stability because they depend on successful segmentation of a protrusion for many consecutive frames. Measurements of protrusion orientation stability over time were strongly influenced by these errors. For this reason, we manually counted all polarity switches in the new analysis.</p></body></sub-article></article>
