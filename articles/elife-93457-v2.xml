Mutations in the human <italic>NINEIN</italic> gene have been linked to Seckel syndrome and to a rare form of skeletal dysplasia. However, the role of ninein in skeletal development remains unknown. Here, we describe a ninein knockout mouse with advanced endochondral ossification during embryonic development. Although the long bones maintain a regular size, the absence of ninein delays the formation of the bone marrow cavity in the prenatal tibia. Likewise, intramembranous ossification in the skull is more developed, leading to a premature closure of the interfrontal suture. We demonstrate that ninein is strongly expressed in osteoclasts of control mice, and that its absence reduces the fusion of precursor cells into syncytial osteoclasts, whereas the number of osteoblasts remains unaffected. As a consequence, ninein-deficient osteoclasts have a reduced capacity to resorb bone. At the cellular level, the absence of ninein interferes with centrosomal microtubule organization, reduces centrosome cohesion, and provokes the loss of centrosome clustering in multinucleated mature osteoclasts. We propose that centrosomal ninein is important for osteoclast fusion, to enable a functional balance between bone-forming osteoblasts and bone-resorbing osteoclasts during skeletal development.</p></abstract><kwd-group kwd-group-type="author-keywords"><kwd>ninein</kwd><kwd>centrosome</kwd><kwd>bone development</kwd><kwd>ossification</kwd><kwd>osteoclast</kwd><kwd>craniosynostosis</kwd></kwd-group><kwd-group kwd-group-type="research-organism"><title>Research organism</title><kwd>Mouse</kwd></kwd-group><funding-group><award-group id="fund1"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100001665</institution-id><institution>Agence Nationale de la Recherche</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>ANR16-CE13-0005-01</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Vérollet</surname><given-names>Christel</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund2"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution>Universite Toulouse III</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>Financement S&amp;N Bernard</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Merdes</surname><given-names>Andreas</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><funding-statement>The funders had no role in study design, data collection and interpretation, or the decision to submit the work for publication.</funding-statement></funding-group><custom-meta-group><custom-meta specific-use="meta-only"><meta-name>Author impact statement</meta-name><meta-value>It is shown that the absence of the centrosome protein ninein provokes premature ossification during mouse development, due to a defect in the fusion of precursor cells into syncytial osteoclasts.</meta-value></custom-meta></custom-meta-group></article-meta></front><body><sec id="s1" sec-type="intro"><title>Introduction</title><p>The centrosome is a small organelle present in most animal cells. It is composed of two cylindrically shaped centrioles that are surrounded by proteins of the pericentriolar material (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib42">Prigent and Uzbekov, 2022</xref>). Because the pericentriolar material contains large amounts of gamma-tubulin-complexes necessary for microtubule nucleation, the centrosome is generally viewed as a major microtubule-organizing center (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">Moritz et al., 1995</xref>). The two centriolar cylinders can be distinguished morphologically: the older one, the mother centriole, carries specific structures termed distal and subdistal appendages. Whereas distal appendages contribute to ciliogenesis, subdistal appendages are involved in microtubule anchorage (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib42">Prigent and Uzbekov, 2022</xref>). This anchorage results in a microtubule network that is radially organized from the centrosome, as seen in undifferentiated cells or in fibroblasts.</p><p>Mutations of multiple genes that encode centrosomal proteins are linked to developmental disorders such as autosomal recessive primary microcephaly (MCPH; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib54">Thornton and Woods, 2009</xref>), microcephalic primordial dwarfism (MPD; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Chavali et al., 2014</xref>), and ciliopathies (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib45">Rao Damerla et al., 2014</xref>). MCPH is characterized by reduced head circumference at birth with a decreased size of the cerebral cortex and cognitive defects. Many microcephaly-associated genes are implicated in centrosome formation, or in the assembly and orientation of mitotic spindles (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Gabriel et al., 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib41">Pirozzi et al., 2018</xref>). So far, abnormal cortical brain development is viewed as the principal cause of microcephaly. In addition to the microcephalic phenotype, features such as growth retardation, malformed limbs, or cranial defects are found in MCPH-related disorders like Seckel syndrome, Meier-Gorlin syndrome, and microcephalic osteodysplastic primordial dwarfism (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Klingseisen and Jackson, 2011</xref>). As in MCPH, a common hallmark of these syndromes are mutations affecting the integrity of centrosomes.</p><p>Among the genetic loci for Seckel syndrome, ninein was characterized more recently (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Dauber et al., 2012</xref>). Ninein is an evolutionarily conserved component that binds to the subdistal appendages at the mother centriole and at the basal body of the primary cilium, and to the proximal ends of both mother and daughter centrioles. At the cellular level, it has been proposed that ninein anchors gamma-tubulin complexes and microtubules to centrosomal and non-centrosomal sites (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">Mogensen et al., 2000</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Dammermann and Merdes, 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Delgehyr et al., 2005</xref>), and that it is necessary for the integrity of mitotic spindle poles and for spindle orientation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Logarinho et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Lecland et al., 2019</xref>). Moreover, ninein has been described as a regulator of cell migration, as it controls the dynein/dynactin-dependent release of microtubules from the centrosome, which is believed to stabilize lamellopodial extensions during cellular movement (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Abal et al., 2002</xref>).</p><p>At the level of the organism, ninein was found to be essential for early brain morphogenesis in zebrafish (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Dauber et al., 2012</xref>). This is consistent with a proposed role of ninein in maintaining neural progenitor cells in the developing mammalian neocortex (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib60">Wang et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib49">Shinohara et al., 2013</xref>). Another report identified mutations in ninein as causative for spondyloepimetaphyseal dysplasia with joint laxity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Grosch et al., 2013</xref>). The hallmarks of this disorder include short stature, midface hypoplasia, joint laxity with dislocations of the hip and knee joints, genua valga, progressive scoliosis and long, slender, fingers. Although this pathogenesis is not well understood, an involvement of ninein in skeletal development was proposed (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Grosch et al., 2013</xref>). Skeletal development involves ossification of the skull and of long bones. Whereas skull bone is formed by intramembranous ossification, long bones develop by replacement of cartilage templates, previously established by chondroblasts. Both ossification pathways include the action of specific cell types, mainly involving osteoblasts and osteoclasts. Osteoblasts are derived from mesenchymal stem cells and produce bone mineral in the form of calcium phosphate crystals. This action is counterbalanced by mineral-resorbing osteoclasts, to control bone growth and homeostasis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Boyle et al., 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib40">Phan et al., 2004</xref>). Bone formation and resorption is a coupled process, illustrated by the fact that osteoclast differentiation and function depend on paracrine stimulation by osteoblasts (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib40">Phan et al., 2004</xref>). The differentiation of osteoclasts occurs from myeloid precursor cells and involves cell fusion into large syncytial cells. The formation of large osteoclasts appears to enhance their bone resorption activity, as smaller syncytia have been found to be less effective (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Lees and Heersche, 1999</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Møller et al., 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Dufrançais et al., 2021</xref>).</p><p>To characterize the role of ninein in bone formation, we investigated ninein-deficient mice during early development. Previous work on ninein-knockout mice had revealed mild defects in the epidermal barrier, without obvious abnormalities in other tissues (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Lecland et al., 2019</xref>). In the present study, we analyzed these mice in more detail and detected temporary but strong irregularities during skeletal development, leading to premature endochondral and intramembranous ossification. Importantly, we found that fusion of precursor cells into mature and functional osteoclasts is impaired in ninein-deficient mice.</p></sec><sec id="s2" sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><sec id="s2-1"><title>Ninein-deficiency and in-utero-development</title><p>Constitutive ninein-knockout mice were viable, without obvious abnormalities, and capable of reproduction (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Lecland et al., 2019</xref>). However, when ninein-deficient animals were intercrossed, a significant reduction in the litter size was observed (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1A</xref>). Following delivery, nearly one third of the newborn pups were severely growth-retarded with signs of dwarfism, reminiscent of what is occurring in patients carrying ninein mutations (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Dauber et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Grosch et al., 2013</xref>). Most growth-retarded pups identified at birth did not survive, and the neonatal lethality was reaching 35% within 48 hr. Whereas spontaneous delivery occurred generally on the nineteenth day post coitum (dpc) in control females, several ninein-deleted females had difficulty to deliver by the 22nd dpc and were then euthanized. Examination of the litters revealed that they never contained more than four pups and that these pups were always dead (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1B</xref>). This increased mortality in utero was exclusively dependent on the zygotic genotype, as ninein knock-out females following mating with wild type males displayed normal litter size and no growth retardation among pups (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1A</xref>). Examination of the uterine horns at mid-gestation, at embryonic day 9.5 post-coitum (E9.5dpc), revealed a similar number of deciduae in wild type and ninein-deleted mothers (8.7±0.8, n=13 vs 9.2±0.8, n=12, respectively). However, following removal of the extraembryonic tissues, very small ninein del/del embryos were frequently found, as well as empty decidua (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1C</xref>). At E11.5, extremely small embryos were occasionally observed (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1D</xref>). A significant reduction in the progeny occurred at mid gestation and accounted for the reduced number of pups observed at birth. The potential role of ninein in these viability-related processes in utero will not be addressed here. In the following experiments, mating between heterozygous mice (del/+) was performed, yielding regular litter sizes. This confirmed that prenatal loss of embryos was largely dependent on the del/del zygotic genotype. Moreover, heterozygous intercrosses enabled quantitative morphological comparison between del/+ (control) and homozygous del/del siblings at the same embryonic stage.</p><fig id="fig1" position="float"><label>Figure 1.</label><caption><title>Ninein knock-out mice display reduced litter size upon a zygotic genotype.</title><p>(<bold>A</bold>) Litter size comparisons following crossings among control or ninein-deleted animals at birth.

We first analyzed embryos on day 18.5 of gestation, as most organs were sufficiently differentiated to assess the presence of developmental defects. No external abnormalities were noticed and polydactyly was never observed upon ninein deprivation. Visceral organs such as the liver and kidney were free of cysts, in contrast to mice mutant for other proteins of centrosomes and cilia, such as Cep290 or Cc2d2a (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib44">Rachel et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib57">Veleri et al., 2014</xref>). Neither laterality defects nor airway defects were present in ninein del/del mice. No morphological abnormalities were noticed in sensory organs such as the eye and ear, although these were not tested functionally. Despite similar embryo sizes of control and knockout mice, attention was paid to the course of skeletal development, as bone dysplasia was reported in patients carrying a ninein mutation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Grosch et al., 2013</xref>). Whole embryos were stained with Alcian blue and Alizarin red, to investigate the formation of cartilage and bone, respectively (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2A</xref>). Examination of E18.5 embryos revealed an advanced ossification in the digits of all ninein-deficient embryos. In the forelimb of control embryos, one ossification center was detected in the metacarpal bone and in the proximal phalange of digits 2–5 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2B</xref>, left panel). By contrast, in mutant embryos, an additional mineralized area was clearly visible in the intermediate phalange of digits 2–4 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2B</xref>, right panel). A similar advanced ossification was observed in the hindlimbs of ninein-deprived embryos (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2C</xref>, right image). The proximal phalange of digit one exhibited a small ossification center, which was never observed in control embryos at this stage. The intermediate phalanges of digits 2–4 started to mineralize in ninein del/del embryos, but not in controls, and the percentage of digits containing three ossification centers increased (graphs below each image in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2B and C</xref>). The data indicate that early endochondral ossification occurred in embryos lacking ninein. However, no differences in bone size were seen in the two groups (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2D</xref>, and morphometric analysis in <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="supp1">Supplementary file 1</xref>). We then looked at the neck region with emphasis on the first and second cervical vertebrae. The atlas exhibited the same degree of ossification in all pups. On the opposite, the second vertebra, the axis, exhibited an additional ossification center within the cartilaginous vertebral body in ninein-deleted embryos (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2E</xref>). To further characterize the onset of this earlier ossification in the limbs, we examined bone formation in controls and mutants at E16.0 and E16.5. First, E16 embryos were stained with alizarin red, to visualize the mineralized bones only (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3A</xref>). In controls, no ossification was visible in the upper and lower foot. In ninein del/del embryos, two metacarpal and three metatarsal bones showed signs of mineralization (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3A</xref>, arrows). In slightly older embryos (E16.5), control metacarpal bones 3 and 4 exhibited tiny red deposits on the internal face (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3B</xref>, left), but not within central metatarsal bones yet (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3C</xref>, left). In ninein-deficient embryos, bone collar formation was already well visible in metacarpal and metatarsal bones (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3B and C</xref>, right). To assess long bone growth and development, we focused on the tibia metaphyseal region. We measured the height of the zones of proliferating and hypertrophied chondrocytes on longitudinal sections of embryonic tibiae as depicted in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3D</xref>. Analysis at E16.5 and E18.5dpc revealed comparable sizes of both zones in controls and ninein del/del embryos (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3H, I</xref>), consistent with comparable lengths of bones from forelimbs and hindlimbs at E16.5 (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="supp1">Supplementary file 1</xref>).

Coronal head sections through the eyes revealed a more widespread mineralization in ninein-deleted embryos (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4</xref>). Notably, frontal bones above the eyes were more intensely mineralized in ninein-deleted embryos than in controls (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4A</xref>). Similar results were obtained in mandibular and palatal bones. Sections more posterior to the eyes revealed frontal bones with a larger trabecular structure that extends toward the interfrontal suture in ninein-deleted embryos (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4B</xref>). Dissection of skull bones coupled with area determination showed larger frontal and parietal bones in skull of E16.5 mutant embryos (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4C and D</xref>). The interparietal bone was slightly longer and twice larger (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4C</xref>). Examination of the 21.5dpc mutant pups that died at delivery allowed us to look at the interfrontal suture at a later stage of development. Although the head circumference was of the same magnitude as in time-mated neonate controls, the interparietal, parietal and frontal bones were larger in mutants, whereas the supraoccipital bone was of the same size (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4E</xref>).

We focused on developing E16.5 embryos, and following X-Gal staining, we identified a strong signal within large multinucleated cells near the growth plate of long bones and adjacent to osteoid matrix, visualized by von-Kossa-staining (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5A and B</xref>). Histological staining of tartrate-resistant acid phosphatase (TRAP) was used as a marker of osteoclasts on serial sections, to confirm that the multinucleated cells were indeed osteoclasts (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5C</xref>). We then combined TRAP analysis with von-Kossa-staining of mineralized deposits in developing tibia and at E16.5 and E18.5. These analyses were limited to the upper metaphyseal border within 400 μm below the zone of hypertrophied chondrocytes at E16.5 and within 600 μm for E18 tibiae (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5D and E</xref>). At E16.5, a significant increase of the mineralized portion of the tibia was detected in ninein del/del embryos (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5F</xref>). This was accompanied by a decrease in osteoclast cell numbers within the same area (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5G</xref>). On E18.5 tibiae, increased mineralization was no longer detected although osteoclast numbers were still significantly reduced (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5G</xref>). To further analyze tibia morphology, we used X-ray microtomography to investigate bone structure in ninein-deleted E18.5 embryos and control siblings (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5H–K</xref>). Scanning through the cortical and trabecular bones below the hypertrophied chondrocytes revealed no difference between control and mutants (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5H, I</xref>), in agreement with histology data. In a subchondral core of the tibia of 200 μm diameter and 700 μm length, the volume occupied by mineralized bone was of the same magnitude in control and ninein-deleted embryos (0.00210±0.00026 mm<sup>3</sup> vs 0.00203±0.00006 mm<sup>3</sup>, respectively), corresponding to a bone volume fraction (BV/TV) of 9.8±1.3 vs 9.4 ± 0.4%, respectively (3D-reconstructed cores in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5H, I</xref>). Meanwhile, analysis performed in the middle of the tibiae in controls revealed that the volume of mineralized bone had reduced by 2-fold (0.00107±0.00025 mm<sup>3</sup>), consistent with the onset of bone marrow cavity formation, following blood vessel invasion in this central part of the bone (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5J</xref>).

First, we followed osteoclastogenesis early in development, at E14.5, which depends on erythro-myeloid progenitors. On longitudinal sections of whole embryos, von-Kossa-staining revealed the absence of mineralization at this stage of development, both in controls and ninein del/del mice (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6s1">Figure 6—figure supplement 1A, B</xref>). On the same sections, TRAP enzymatic reaction indicated the presence of osteoclast progenitors in the fetal liver, an active site of erythro-myeloid hematopoiesis in all E14.5 embryos. Two additional foci of TRAP-positive cells were observed in an area corresponding to the mandibular and maxillary bone formation, the first bones to mineralize (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6s1">Figure 6—figure supplement 1A, B</xref>). We therefore focused our analysis on the initial steps of intramembranous ossification in the developing mandible. Numerous TRAP-positive cells were detected close to Meckel’s cartilage, in both control and ninein-deleted embryos (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6s1">Figure 6—figure supplement 1C, D</xref>). Because the first step of bone formation involves the production of a collagenous matrix by condensed mesenchymal cells, we used Sirius Red dye to verify that collagen deposition was effective in the mandible area, where osteoclast progenitors were detected (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6s1">Figure 6—figure supplement 1E, F</xref>). Similarly, the presence of bone-forming osteoblasts was confirmed using alkaline phosphatase enzymatic reaction (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6s1">Figure 6—figure supplement 1G, H</xref>). All three staining protocols yielded comparable results in control and ninein del/del siblings. Since the expression of tartrate-resistant acid phosphatase was prominent in the mandible area, we counted TRAP-positive cells and their number of nuclei, to assess early fusion events in osteoclast formation in E14.5 littermates. Images of TRAP-positive cells with one, two or three nuclei are presented in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6A</xref>. Morphological changes in TRAP-positive cells were observed, from small round mononucleated cells, to elongated binucleated cells and large cells with many nuclei on the surface of the osteoid matrix, as recently published (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">Nakamura et al., 2021</xref>). Quantitative analysis of approximately 1300 cells/genotype showed that mononucleated osteoclast progenitors represented the vast majority of TRAP-positive cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6A</xref>). They were significantly more abundant in ninein-deleted embryos, as compared to control littermates. Similar percentages of binucleated osteoclasts were counted in control and ninein-deleted E14.5 embryos.

Bone marrow cells from control and ninein-deleted newborn mice were seeded on glass coverslips, of which osteoclast precursors spontaneously adhered to the glass surface, whereas non-adherent cells (more than 98% of the cells initially seeded) could be rinsed off after one hour. TRAP-positive cells were classified in four categories: (i) single mononucleate cells, (ii) aggregates of cells with sporadic intercellular contacts with generally a TRAP-positive cell in the center, (iii) large clusters of cells with larger contact areas, reminiscent of cells engaged in the fusion process, and (iv) multinucleated osteoclasts (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6B</xref>). These four categories resembled the classical steps of osteoclastogenesis, as previously described (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Boyle et al., 2003</xref>). Quantification of each category indicated that multinucleated osteoclasts were significantly less abundant in samples from ninein-deleted neonates, whereas single TRAP-positive cells were more numerous, in comparison to controls (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6B</xref>). The percentages of aggregates with unfused or fused cells were similar in both groups.</p><p>To further explore the possibility of ninein-dependent fusion defects among osteoclast precursors, we used cultures of adult bone marrow from femur, as described (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib58">Vérollet et al., 2013</xref>). Fusion of precursor cells into syncytia occurred within 3 days in the presence of RANK-L. From day 3 onwards, control osteoclasts reached diameters of several hundred microns, and the increase in cell surface correlated in a linear fashion with the number of syncytial nuclei (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7A and B</xref>). The largest syncytia contained more than 100 nuclei, consistent with other reports on mouse osteoclasts in culture (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib55">Tiedemann et al., 2017</xref>). A comparable correlation was seen in osteoclasts from ninein-deleted bone marrow, but larger syncytia were significantly less abundant in these mutants (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7B</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7s1">Figure 7—figure supplement 1A, B</xref>). To investigate the fusion competence of control and ninein-deficient osteoclast cultures, we determined the fusion indices, by quantifying the number of syncytial nuclei relative to the total number of nuclei in the culture. We found that the fusion index of osteoclasts from ninein-knockout mice was 1.8 times lower than in cultures from control mice (9% vs 16%, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7C</xref>). Likewise, multinucleated osteoclasts in ninein-deficient cultures covered an area that was 1.9 times smaller than in control cultures, with the total density of nuclei (combined from fused and unfused cells) being comparable for the two genotypes (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7C</xref>). To verify whether reduced fusion in ninein-deficient cells was resulting from differences in proliferation and cell cycle progression, we established cell cycle profiles (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7D</xref>), and we quantified the expression of the proliferation marker Ki-67 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7s1">Figure 7—figure supplement 1C</xref>) one day before the onset of fusion. No significant differences between control and mutant cultures were detected. To exclude the effect of cell death on osteoclastogenesis in ninein-deficient cultures, we performed co-staining with Annexin V and propidium iodide, and we controlled for the presence of cleaved poly-(ADP-ribose)-polymerase (PARP) and cleaved caspase 3 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7s1">Figure 7—figure supplement 1D, E</xref>). Again, no differences were seen between the different genotypes. We could further exclude any significant differences in cell attachment of the osteoclast precursor cells, since numbers of adherent cells and expression profiles of beta-integrins were comparable prior to osteoclast fusion (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7s1">Figure 7—figure supplement 1F, G</xref>). In summary, our data indicate that ninein-deficient osteoclast precursors exhibit specific defects in cell fusion during osteoclastogenesis. Next, we quantified the abundance of large syncytia (from 5000 to 50,000 μm<sup>2</sup>) on days 3, 4, and 5 in culture, following TRAP staining. On average, these large syncytia represented less than 5% of osteoclasts of both genotypes (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7s1">Figure 7—figure supplement 1A</xref>), but they were twice as abundant in control cultures on days 3 and 4, as compared to ninein-deleted samples (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7s1">Figure 7—figure supplement 1B</xref>). However, on day 5, the abundance of large syncytia lacking ninein climbed to more than 90% of control levels, suggesting that fusion deficiencies are a transient phenomenon in in vitro-induced adult osteoclasts.

As expected, precursor cells isolated from bone marrow of ninein-deleted neonates were negative for ninein (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8">Figure 8A</xref>). Staining with the centriolar marker centrin revealed that mother and daughter centrioles were separated to varying degrees in the absence of ninein (mean distance 1.1 μm±0.2, n=11 different mice), whereas in control cells they remained more closely associated (0.6 μm±0.1, n = 7 different mice; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8">Figure 8A</xref>).

Because ninein interacts with the dynein/dynactin complex, and because dynein/dynactin itself possesses a microtubule-focusing activity, we tested for the presence of the dynactin subunit p150 in ninein del/del cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib43">Quintyne et al., 1999</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Casenghi et al., 2005</xref>).

The defects in precursor cells from bone marrow of adult ninein-deleted mice resembled those seen in cells from newborn mice, and loss of microtubule focusing was even more pronounced (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8">Figure 8D and E</xref>). Upon fusion into multinucleated osteoclasts, significant differences in centrosome positioning became apparent in ninein-deleted cells. Each fusing precursor cell contributes one centrosome, that is two centrioles, to the syncytium. Whereas the numerous centrioles in control osteoclasts were all regrouped in one or very few clusters, the individual centrioles in osteoclasts lacking ninein were scattered or localized close to the surfaces of the syncytial nuclei (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8">Figure 8F and G</xref>). Large clusters of centrioles in control osteoclasts represented focal points of microtubule organization and dynactin accumulation, whereas no comparable focusing was visible in ninein del/del osteoclasts (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8">Figure 8F and G</xref>). Quantification of centriole clustering (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8">Figure 8H</xref>) was performed as described by <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib40">Phan et al., 2004</xref>, revealing that 93% of control osteoclasts displayed at least one cluster, whereas only 11% of ninein del/del osteoclasts showed any clustering. Moreover, multiple clusters were visible in medium and large control osteoclasts, but completely absent from any ninein del/del osteoclasts. The occasional appearance of a single cluster in mutant osteoclasts of any size may be due to random proximity of centrioles, rather than active clustering.</p><fig id="fig8" position="float"><label>Figure 8.</label><caption><title>Abnormal centriole clustering in osteoclast cultures from ninein-deleted animals.</title><p>(<bold>A</bold>) Double immunofluorescence of neonatal osteoclast progenitors for ninein (nin) and centrin (cen), (<bold>B</bold>) α and γ-tubulin, and (<bold>C</bold>) γ-tubulin and dynactin-subunit p150.

We found that osteoclasts are very sensitive to the loss of ninein, thus revealing an unexpected role of ninein in bone formation. Although the bone abnormalities we describe here are apparently minor, we show that they have a pronounced effect on the closure of the skull suture, which may ultimately lead to craniosynostosis. Multiple craniosynostosis-related syndromes have been described in humans, most of them secondary to impaired signaling by FGF or BMP (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib67">Zhao et al., 2023</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib56">Ueharu and Mishina, 2023</xref>). Excess osteogenic differentiation of suture mesenchymal cells or defects of stem cells in sutures is usually thought to be the leading cause of craniosynostosis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib56">Ueharu and Mishina, 2023</xref>). Interestingly, craniosynostosis has been reported for a group of patients with microcephalic Seckel syndrome (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">Parent et al., 1996</xref>). Here we propose that osteoclast defects might be a novel element contributing to microcephaly in humans upon ninein mutation, in addition to proliferative defects that impact on the overall growth of the body and the brain (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Dauber et al., 2012</xref>).</p><sec id="s3-1"><title>Lack of multinucleate osteoclasts as a cause for ossification defects</title><p>Recent publications on the developmental origin of osteoclasts have highlighted the various cell lineages involved in osteoclastogenesis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Jacome-Galarza et al., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib63">Yahara et al., 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib64">Yahara et al., 2021</xref>). Embryonic and neonatal osteoclasts can derive from embryonic precursors such as yolk-sac-derived macrophages, fetal liver myeloid progenitors, and/or hematopoietic stem cells precursors. The initial fusion of osteoclasts that we observed at E14.5 likely involved the population derived from erythroid-myeloid progenitors, since these are the first to be generated at mid-gestation. We show that for intramembranous ossification of the mandible at this early stage, numerous mononucleated osteoclast progenitors and osteoblasts are already present along collagen fibers prior to initiation of mineralization, consistent with previous studies (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">Nakamura et al., 2021</xref>). The reduced percentage of multinucleated osteoclasts in the ninein-deleted embryos likely disturbs the balance between bone formation and degradation, as mononucleated osteoclasts are thought to have a lower capacity of bone resorption. This was emphasized in an earlier report on a microphthalmic osteopetrotic mouse in which mononucleated osteoclasts result from fusion defects in very young embryos (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib53">Thesingh and Scherft, 1985</xref>). These osteoclasts function inefficiently in bone resorption at prenatal stages. One hallmark of osteopetrosis is the failure of forming a normal bone marrow cavity, which usually involves osteoclasts formed from early and late erythroid-myeloid progenitors (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib64">Yahara et al., 2021</xref>). These progenitors give rise to long-lasting osteoclast precursors that contribute to postnatal bone remodeling through fusion with hematopoietic-derived osteoclasts. In our ninein del/del embryos, we observe delayed bone cavity formation in prenatal tibiae, although we do not detect osteopetrosis. Notably, the microphthalmic osteopetrotic mouse is able to produce multinucleated osteoclasts in the bone marrow ten days after birth, suggesting that a more mature bone marrow may compensate for earlier defects (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib53">Thesingh and Scherft, 1985</xref>). Similarly, the fusion defects in osteoclast cultures from ninein del/del mice appear to be transient, as longer times of cell culture allowed for compensation of these defects.</p></sec><sec id="s3-2"><title>Cellular defects underlying reduced osteoclastogenesis</title><p>Ninein-dependent defects may be responsible for reduced cell proliferation or cell death that may, at least in part, restrain growth at very early embryonic stages in ninein-KO mice. Abnormalities of the mitotic spindles may be at the origin of these defects, since ninein has been reported to localize to the spindle poles and to prevent the formation of multipolar spindles (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Logarinho et al., 2012</xref>). Consistently, loss of a ninein homologue in <italic>Drosophila</italic> increases the frequency of mitotic defects, even though the gene is dispensable for the viability of the fly (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Kowanda et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib68">Zheng et al., 2016</xref>). Besides playing a role in mitotic fidelity, ninein has been shown to contribute to spindle orientation and may therefore help maintaining the pool of proliferative progenitor cells in asymmetric divisions (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Lecland et al., 2019</xref>). However, we demonstrate that specifically in osteoclastogenesis, the absence of ninein affects directly the fusion process of mononucleated osteoclast precursors into syncytial osteoclasts, whereas cell proliferation, attachment, and viability of precursors in culture remain unaffected by the ninein-knockout. An efficient fusion process is thought to require the proximity of cells, which depends on directed cell migration. Directed migration is supported by a centrosomal microtubule-organizing center that grows microtubules towards the cell’s leading edge, and to the uropod in cells undergoing amoeboid movements (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Luxton and Gundersen, 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Kopf and Kiermaier, 2021</xref>). Loss of the centrosomal organizing center interferes with directional migration, whereas reinforcement by amplification and clustering of centrioles enhances directional migration (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib59">Wakida et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib61">Weier et al., 2022</xref>). The fusion of precursor cells into osteoclasts is finally mediated by intercellular contacts. Fusions are thought to require local polarization of the cells and the formation of microtubule-dependent cell extensions (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib51">Straube and Merdes, 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Dufrançais et al., 2021</xref>). We hypothesize that both directional cell migration and fusion require a strongly focused microtubule array, organized from a single centrosomal center. In osteoclast precursors from ninein-KO mice, we observe loss of microtubule attachment at the centrosome, and splitting of the organizing center by separation of the two centrioles. These findings are consistent with similar observations in other cell types (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Dammermann and Merdes, 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">Mazo et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib52">Theile et al., 2023</xref>). We believe that these defects interfere with the directionality of radial microtubule growth towards the cell periphery and thereby interfere with the directional transport of membrane vesicles, during cell migration and during the formation of plasma membrane extensions in fusing osteoclasts. In a somewhat analogous manner, cell polarity in neurons and the initial formation of the axonal cell extension depend on centrosomal microtubules (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">de Anda et al., 2005</xref>).</p></sec><sec id="s3-3"><title>Ninein-dependent protein interactions during osteoclastogenesis</title><p>At the molecular level, ninein-dependent microtubule anchorage and centrosome cohesion may depend, at least in part, on the interaction with the dynein/dynactin complex. An amino-terminal domain of ninein is known to bind to dynein/dynactin and to play a role in dynein activation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Casenghi et al., 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib46">Redwine et al., 2017</xref>). Depletions of the dynactin subunit p150 or of the dynein heavy chain cause splitting of the centrioles (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Kodani et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Malik et al., 2016</xref>). Moreover, depletions of the dynein regulator proteins Lis1 and Nde1 interfere with the motility and fusion of osteoclast precursors, and Lis1-depletion also leads to altered microtubule organization in osteoclasts (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib65">Ye et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Das et al., 2021</xref>). A dynein/dynactin-dependent mechanism may equally contribute to the clustering of the numerous centrioles observed in multinucleated osteoclasts (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib40">Phan et al., 2004</xref>). In addition to perinuclear microtubule-organizing centers, these centriole clusters provide large focal points for microtubule organization and may thereby support cell extensions, for fusion with additional precursors into even larger syncytia (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">Mulari et al., 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib40">Phan et al., 2004</xref>). Furthermore, clustered centrioles appear to be necessary for osteoclast polarity and secretory processes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Lee et al., 2023</xref>). As we demonstrate here, the quantity of dynactin at the centrosome is largely reduced in the absence of ninein, and clustering of centrioles fails to take place. As in mononucleated precursor cells, a self-centering force on the centrioles, dependent on ninein-bound dynein/dynactin may be required for this clustering process. In addition, ninein may play a direct role as a linker component between centrioles, as suggested from recent experiments in various human cell lines (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib52">Theile et al., 2023</xref>). The absence of ninein may therefore explain the clustering defect we observed in mature osteoclasts. Interestingly, homozygous missense mutations in the ninein gene of patients with spondyloepimetaphyseal dysplasia were shown to alter the carboxy-terminal domain of ninein (N2082D), in an area that mediates the interaction with the centriolar linker protein cNap1 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Grosch et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib66">Zhang et al., 2016</xref>). Since cNap1 is directly involved in maintaining centrosome cohesion (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Mayor et al., 2000</xref>), it is conceivable that centriole-splitting contributes to ossification defects. Furthermore, a truncation mutation in cNap1 in cows is at the origin of centriole splitting and cell migration defects, as well as Seckel-like syndromes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Floriot et al., 2015</xref>). Clustering of centrioles may also contribute to the functionality of placental cells and thereby insure early embryonic growth, since specialized cells of the embryonic trophoectoderm, trophoblast giant cells, are polyploid and display centrosome amplification (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Klisch et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Buss et al., 2022</xref>), with clustered centrioles identified in binucleate bovine trophoblast cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Klisch et al., 2017</xref>). Thus, early embryonic growth defects in our ninein-deficient mouse embryos may be explained in part by impaired centriole clustering, in addition to potential abnormalities in proliferation and cell death.</p><p>Besides contributing to centrosome cohesion, ninein may regulate the number of microtubules attached at the centrosome (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Dammermann and Merdes, 2002</xref>), either by holding onto microtubule minus-ends via dynein/dynactin, or via the ninein-interactor Cep170 that has direct microtubule-binding affinity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib43">Quintyne et al., 1999</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib62">Welburn and Cheeseman, 2012</xref>). Ninein may thus anchor microtubules to the subdistal appendages, as well as to the proximal regions of the centriolar surface (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">Mogensen et al., 2000</xref>). However, in contrast to earlier proposals (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Delgehyr et al., 2005</xref>), ninein may not affect the nucleation of centrosomal microtubules, as we see no significant reduction of gamma-tubulin at the centrosomes of ninein-depleted cells. Independent of its centrosomal function, ninein may play a role in the recruitment of F-actin fibers to cortical sites by interacting with dynein/dynactin, as highlighted in a recent study on macrophages (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">Omer et al., 2024</xref>), raising the question whether ninein-knockout may cause subtle alterations in the actin cytoskeleton in osteoclast precursors.</p></sec><sec id="s3-4"><title>Conclusion</title><p>Altogether, the ninein-dependent defects at the cellular level are subtle, since osteoclast fusion still takes place, albeit less efficiently.

Acquisition of histology images was performed following automatic scanning using Hamamatsu Nanozoomer HT with a 20 x objective or using Nikon Eclipse 80i microscope with a 40x1.4 NA objective, Nikon DMX1200 camera and NIS Elements AR software.</p></sec><sec id="s4-4"><title>X-ray microtomography</title><p>Tibiae from E18.5 control and ninein-deleted embryos were submitted to X-ray computed microtomography to evaluate the bone morphology. A Phoenix/GE Nanotom 180 instrument using a diamond target (mode 0) was used at a voltage of 70 kV and a current of 300 μA. Samples were positioned at 11 mm from the RX target and at 400 mm from the detector, with a counting time of 750ms per picture and an average of five pictures per 0.25°step. Datos X software was used to process the data and reconstruct 3D images of the bones. Images were treated using Vg Studio Max software. The maximum voxel size was 1.4 μm.</p></sec><sec id="s4-5"><title>Ex vivo characterization of osteoclasts</title><p>Bone marrow cells were isolated following mechanical disaggregation of long bones from P0 mice, 4 hr after birth. Briefly, after dissection of both forelimb and hindlimb in PBS, bones were freed of muscles and tendons with scalpel and forceps and placed in serum-free α-MEM. Both ends of all long bones were discarded. All central vascularized and bony regions were then longitudinally cut and curetted with a scalpel blade to release cells of the marrow-filled diaphyses into the medium. After pipetting up and down and filtering through a 40 μm cell strainer, cells were centrifuged at 330 × <italic>g</italic> for 5 min, seeded onto glass coverslips in a 24-well plate, and allowed to attach. Cells were grown for 1 hr at 37 °C with 5% CO<sub>2</sub> in serum-free α-MEM. Adhesive cells were then fixed with 4% paraformaldehyde in PBS at room temperature for 30 min to perform immunohistochemistry and TRAP staining. All TRAP-positive cells were counted and classified as mononucleate cells, multinucleate osteoclasts, cells within a fusion cluster, or part of an aggregate of unfused cells.</p></sec><sec id="s4-6"><title>Bone-marrow-derived osteoclasts and microscopic techniques</title><p>For immunofluorescence, coverslips were fixed in methanol at –20 °C for 10 min, followed by staining with primary antibodies against alpha-tubulin (monoclonal DM1A, Sigma-Aldrich), gamma-tubulin (rabbit serum R75, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Julian et al., 1993</xref>), centrin (monoclonal 20H5, Sigma-Aldrich), dynactin p150glued (cat. no 612708, BD Transduction Laboratories), and ninein (rabbit serum 1732, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib50">Srsen et al., 2009</xref>). Images were acquired on a Zeiss Axiovert 200 M inverted microscope using a 100 x/1.4NA objective and an AxioCam MRm camera. Osteoclast cultures from adult bone marrow cells and bone resorption assays were prepared as described (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib58">Vérollet et al., 2013</xref>), in αMEM medium, containing 10% fetal calf serum, 1% glutamine, 30 ng/ml mouse M-CSF, and 50 ng/ml RANK-L (Miltenyi Biotec). Bone marrow cells were cultured in the absence of RANK-L for 2 days prior to adding complete medium, or exposed directly to complete medium upon harvest (in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7C and D</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7s1">Figure 7—figure supplement 1C–G</xref>). Measurements of the cell surface and the number of nuclei of syncytial osteoclasts were performed on coverslips of TRAP-stained cells. Using a 10 x lens with phase contrast, neighboring fields of view of the entire coverslip were recorded and subsequently analyzed manually with ImageJ, using the ‘freehand’ selection tool to outline the cell borders, followed by the ‘measurement’ function. Nuclei were visible by phase contrast and counted manually for each syncytium. Alternatively, for the measurement of the osteoclast fusion index, paraformaldehyde-fixed coverslips were stained with phalloidin-Alexa 488 and 4′,6-diamidino-2-phenylindole (DAPI), to visualize actin along the podosome belt, and nuclei respectively. Using ImageJ ‘freehand’ selection along the podosome belts as well as a home-written macro, the number of nuclei in syncytia was determined relative to the total number of nuclei in a field of view. Each field of view had a surface of 1,700,000 μm<sup>2</sup>.</p><p>Cell adhesion to 96-well culture plates (100,000 cells/well) was quantified after fixation with 4% paraformaldehyde in PBS, rinsing, and staining with 0.1% crystal violet for 30 min, followed by rinsing in water and solubilization of the dye in 2% sodium dodecyl sulfate for 30 min. Absorption of the dye was measured at 550 nm.</p><p>Centriole clustering in osteoclasts was examined in methanol-fixed cultures after 3 days of RANK-L treatment, following immunofluorescence of γ-tubulin. Quantification of clusters was performed as described in <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib40">Phan et al., 2004</xref>.</p></sec><sec id="s4-7"><title>Flow cytometry</title><p>Cells were harvested with Accutase (Sigma-Aldrich), rinsed with PBS, and collected by centrifugation at 500 x <italic>g</italic> for 5 min, then stained with the LIVE/DEAD kit (Fisher Scientific) according to the manufacturer’s instructions.
