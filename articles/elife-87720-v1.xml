anxiety-related psychopathology, differences in the measurement of avoidance between humans and non-human animals hinder our progress in its theoretical understanding and treatment. To address this, we developed a novel translational measure of anxiety-related avoidance in the form of an approach-avoidance reinforcement learning task, by adapting a paradigm from the non-human animal literature to study the same cognitive processes in human participants. We used computational modelling to probe the putative cognitive mechanisms underlying approach-avoidance behaviour in this task and investigated how they relate to subjective task-induced anxiety. In a large online study (n = 372), participants who experienced greater task-induced anxiety avoided choices associated with punishment, even when this resulted in lower overall reward. Computational modelling revealed that this effect was explained by greater individual sensitivities to punishment relative to rewards. We replicated these findings in an independent sample (n = 627) and we also found fair-to-excellent reliability of measures of task performance in a sub-sample retested 1 week later (n = 57). Our findings demonstrate the potential of approach-avoidance reinforcement learning tasks as translational and computational models of anxiety-related avoidance. Future studies should assess the predictive validity of this approach in clinical samples and experimental manipulations of anxiety.</p></abstract><kwd-group kwd-group-type="author-keywords"><kwd>anxiety</kwd><kwd>computational modelling</kwd><kwd>translational</kwd><kwd>approach-avoidance conflict</kwd><kwd>reinforcement learning</kwd></kwd-group><kwd-group kwd-group-type="research-organism"><title>Research organism</title><kwd>Human</kwd></kwd-group><funding-group><award-group id="fund1"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://doi.org/10.13039/100004440</institution-id><institution>Wellcome Trust</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>PhD Studentship 222268/Z/20/Z</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Yamamori</surname><given-names>Yumeya</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund2"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://doi.org/10.13039/501100000265</institution-id><institution>Medical Research Council</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>Senior Non-Clinical Fellowship MR/R020817/1</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Robinson</surname><given-names>Oliver J</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund3"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://doi.org/10.13039/100004440</institution-id><institution>Wellcome Trust</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>Investigator Award 101798/Z/13/Z</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Roiser</surname><given-names>Jonathan P</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><funding-statement>The funders had no role in study design, data collection and interpretation, or the decision to submit the work for publication.

This occurs when avoidance is costly, that is, when the act to avoid harm or threat requires the sacrifice of something positive. When offered the opportunity to attend a job interview, for example, the reward of landing a new job must be weighed against the risk of experiencing rejection and/or embarrassment due to fluffing the interview. On balance, declining a single interview would likely have little impact on one’s life, but routinely avoiding job interviews would jeopardise one’s long-term professional opportunities. More broadly, consistent avoidance in similar situations, which are referred to as involving <italic>approach-avoidance conflict</italic>, can have an increasingly negative impact as the sum of forgone potential reward accumulates, ultimately leading to missed opportunities in life. Such excessive avoidance is a hallmark symptom of pathological anxiety (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Barlow, 2002</xref>) and avoidance biases during approach-avoidance conflict are thought to drive the development and maintenance of anxiety-related (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Hayes, 1976</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib68">Stein and Paulus, 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Aupperle and Paulus, 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib45">Mkrtchian et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib69">Struijs et al., 2018</xref>) and other psychiatric disorders (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Aldao et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">Kakoschke et al., 2019</xref>).</p><p>How is behaviour during approach-avoidance conflict measured quantitatively? In non-human animals, this can be achieved through behavioural paradigms that induce a conflict between natural approach and avoidance drives. For example, in the ‘Geller-Seifter conflict test’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Geller et al., 1962</xref>), rodents decide whether or not to press a lever that is associated with the delivery of both food pellets and shocks, thus inducing a conflict. Anxiolytic drugs typically increase lever presses during the test (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib72">Treit et al., 2010</xref>), supporting its validity as a model of anxiety-related avoidance. Consequently, this test along with others inducing approach-avoidance conflict are often used as non-human animal tests of anxiety (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Griebel and Holmes, 2013</xref>). In humans, on the other hand, approach-avoidance conflict has historically been measured using questionnaires such as the Behavioural Inhibition/Activation Scale (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Carver and White, 1994</xref>), or cognitive tasks that rely on motor/response time biases, for example by using joysticks to approach/move towards positive stimuli and avoid/move away from negative stimuli (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Guitart-Masip et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib51">Phaf et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">Kirlic et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib45">Mkrtchian et al., 2017</xref>).</p><p>Translational approaches, specifically when equivalent tasks are used to measure the same cognitive construct in humans and non-human animals, benefit the study of avoidance and its relevance to mental ill-health for two important reasons (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Bach, 2022</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib52">Pike et al., 2021</xref>). First, precise causal manipulations of neural circuitry such as chemo/optogenetics are only feasible in non-human animals, whereas only humans can verbalise their subjective experiences – it is only by using translational measures that we can integrate data and theory across species to achieve a comprehensive mechanistic understanding. Second, translational paradigms can make the testing of novel anxiolytic drugs more efficient and cost-effective, since those that fail to reduce anxiety-related avoidance in humans could be identified earlier during the development pipeline.</p><p>Since the inception of non-human animal models of psychiatric disorders, researchers have recognised that it is infeasible to fully recapitulate a disorder like generalised anxiety disorder in non-human animals due to the complexity of human cognition and subjective experience. Instead, the main strategy has been to reproduce the physiological and behavioural responses elicited under certain scenarios across species, such as during fear conditioning (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Craske et al., 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib44">Milad and Quirk, 2012</xref>). Computational modelling of behaviour (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">Kriegeskorte and Douglas, 2018</xref>) allows us to take a step further and probe the <italic>mechanisms</italic> underlying such physiological and behavioural responses, using a mathematically principled approach. A fundamental premise of this approach is that the brain acts as an information-processing organ that performs computations responsible for observable behaviours, including approach and avoidance (for a recent review on the application of computational methods to approach-avoidance conflict, see <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib41">Letkiewicz et al., 2023</xref>). With respect to translational models, it follows that a valid translational measure of some behaviour not only matches the observable responses across species, but also their underlying computational mechanisms. This criterion, which has been termed <italic>computational validity</italic>, has been proposed as the primary basis for evaluating the validity of translational measures (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib55">Redish et al., 2022</xref>).</p><p>To exploit the advantages of translational and computational approaches, there has been a recent surge in efforts to create relevant approach-avoidance conflict tasks in humans, based on non-human animal models (referred to as back-translation; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">Kirlic et al., 2017</xref>). One stream of research has focused on exploration-based paradigms, which involve measuring how participants spend their time in environments that include potentially anxiogenic regions. Rodents typically avoid such regions, which can take the form of tall, exposed platforms as in the elevated plus maze (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib50">Pellow et al., 1985</xref>), or large open spaces as in the open-field test (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Hall, 1934</xref>). Similar behaviours have been observed in humans when virtual reality was used to translate the elevated plus maze (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Biedermann et al., 2017</xref>), and when participants were free to walk around a field or around town (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib76">Walz et al., 2016</xref>). These translational tasks have excellent face validity in that they involve almost identical behaviour compared to their non-human analogues, and their predictive validity is supported by findings that individual differences in self-reported anxiety are associated with greater avoidance of the exposed/open regions of space (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib76">Walz et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Biedermann et al., 2017</xref>). But what of their computational validity? The computations underlying free movement are difficult to model as the action space is large and complex (consisting of two-dimensional directions, velocity, etc.), which makes it difficult to understand the precise cognitive mechanisms underlying avoidance in these tasks.</p><p>Other studies have designed tasks that emulate operant conflict paradigms in which non-human participants learn to associate certain actions with both reward and punishment, such as the Geller-Seifter and Vogel conflict tests (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Geller et al., 1962</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib74">Vogel et al., 1971</xref>). These studies used decision-making tasks in which participants choose between offers consisting of both reward and punishment outcomes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Aupperle et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib64">Sierra-Mercado et al., 2015</xref>). The strengths of such decision tasks lie in the simplicity of their action space (accept/reject an offer; choose offer A or B), which facilitates the computational modelling of decision-making, through for example value-based logistic regression models (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">Ironside et al., 2020</xref>) or drift-diffusion modelling (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib49">Pedersen et al., 2021</xref>). However, these tasks have less face validity compared to exploration-based tasks, as explicit offers (‘Will you accept £1 to incur an electric shock?’) are incomprehensible to the majority of non-human animals (although non-human primates can be trained to do so, see: <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib64">Sierra-Mercado et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">Ironside et al., 2020</xref>). Instead, non-human participants such as rodents typically have to learn the possible outcomes given their actions, for example that a lever press is associated with both food pellets and electric shocks. Critically, this means that humans performing offer-based decision-making are doing something <italic>computationally dissimilar</italic> to non-human participants during operant conflict tasks, and the criterion of computational validity is unmet. Moreover, evidence from economic decision-making suggests that explicit offers of probabilistic outcomes can impact decision-making differently compared to when probabilistic contingencies need to be learned from experience (referred to as the ‘description-experience gap’; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">Hertwig and Erev, 2009</xref>); this finding raises potential concerns regarding the use of offer-based tasks in humans as approximations of non-human tasks that do not involve explicit offers.</p><p>Therefore, in the current study, we developed a novel translational task that was specifically designed to mimic the computational processes involved in non-human operant conflict tasks, and was also amenable to computational modelling of behaviour. During the task, participants chose between options that were asymmetrically associated with rewards and punishments, such that the more rewarding options were more likely to result in punishment. However, in contrast to previous translations of these tests using purely offer-based designs, participants had to learn the likelihoods of receiving rewards and/or punishments from experience, thus ensuring computational validity.</p><p>Preserving the element of learning in our translational task did not necessarily risk confounding the study of approach-avoidance behaviour. Rather, a critical advantage of our approach was that we could model the cognitive processes underlying approach-avoidance behaviour using classical reinforcement learning algorithms (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib70">Sutton and Barto, 2018</xref>), and then use these algorithms to disentangle the relative contributions of learning and value-based decision-making to anxiety-related avoidance. Specifically, using the reinforcement learning framework; we accounted for individual differences in learning by estimating learning rates, which govern the degree to which recently observed outcomes affect subsequent actions; and we explained individual differences in value-based decision-making using outcome sensitivity parameters, which model the subjective values of rewards and punishments for each participant.</p><p>We therefore aimed to develop a new translational measure of approach-avoidance conflict. Based on previous findings that anxiety predicts avoidance biases under conflict (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib76">Walz et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Biedermann et al., 2017</xref>), we predicted that anxiety would increase avoidance responses (and conversely decrease approach responses) and that this would be reflected in changes in computational parameters. Having found evidence for this in a large initial online study, we retested the prediction that anxiety-related avoidance is explained by greater sensitivity to punishments relative to rewards in a pre-registered independent replication sample.</p></sec><sec id="s2" sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><sec id="s2-1"><title>The approach-avoidance reinforcement learning task</title><p>We developed a novel approach-avoidance conflict task, based on the ‘restless bandit’ design (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Daw et al., 2006</xref>), in which the participants’ goal was to accrue rewards whilst avoiding punishments (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1a</xref>). On each of 200 trials, participants chose one of two options, depicted as distinct visual stimuli, to obtain certain outcomes. There were four possible outcomes: a monetary reward (represented by a coin); an aversive sound consisting of a combination of a female scream and a high-pitched sound; both the reward and aversive sound; or no reward and no sound (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1b</xref>). The options were asymmetric in their associated outcomes, such that one option (which we refer to as the ‘conflict’ option) was associated with both the reward and aversive sound, whereas the other (the ‘safe’ option) was only associated with the reward (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1c</xref>). In other words, choosing the conflict option could result in any of the four possible outcomes on any given trial, but the safe option could only lead to either the reward or no reward, and never the aversive sounds.</p><fig id="fig1" position="float"><label>Figure 1.</label><caption><title>The approach-avoidance reinforcement learning task.</title><p>(<bold>a</bold>) Trial timeline.

Unbeknownst to the participant, one of the options (which we refer to as the ‘conflict’ option – solid lines) was generally more rewarding compared to the other option (the ‘safe’ option – dashed line) across trials. However, the conflict option was also the only option of the two that was associated with a probability of producing an aversive sound (the probability that the safe option produced the aversive sound was 0 across all trials). The probabilities of observing each outcome given the choice of option fluctuated randomly and independently across trials.

On average, the safe option was less likely to produce the reward compared to the conflict option across the task (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1d</xref>). Therefore, we induced an approach-avoidance conflict between the options as the conflict option was generally more rewarding but also more likely to result in punishment. Participants were not informed about this asymmetric feature of the task, but they were told that the probabilities of observing the reward or the sound were independent and that they could change across trials.</p><p>We initially investigated behaviour in the task in a discovery sample (n = 369) after which the key effects-of-interest were retested in a pre-registered study (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://osf.io/8dm95">https://osf.io/8dm95</ext-link>) with an independent replication sample (n = 629). The discovery sample had a significantly greater proportion of female participants than the replication sample (59% vs 52%, χ<sup>2</sup> = 4.64, <italic>p </italic>= 0.031). The average age was also significantly different across samples (discovery sample mean = 37.7, SD = 10.3, replication sample mean = 34.3, SD = 10.4; <italic>t</italic><sub>785.5</sub> = 5.06, <italic>p </italic>&lt; 0.001). The differences in self-reported psychiatric symptoms across samples did not reach significance (<italic>p </italic>&gt; 0.086). Since our behavioural findings were broadly comparable across samples, we primarily report findings from the discovery sample and discuss deviations from these findings in the replication sample. A detailed comparison of statistical findings across samples is reported in Appendix 1.</p></sec><sec id="s2-2"><title>Choices reflect both approach and avoidance</title><p>First, we verified that participants demonstrated both approach and avoidance responses during the task through a hierarchical logistic regression model, in which we used the latent outcome probabilities to predict trial-by-trial choice. Overall, participants learned to optimise their choices to accrue rewards and avoid the aversive sounds. As expected, across trials participants chose (i.e. approached) the option with relatively higher reward probability (<italic>β</italic> = 0.98 ± 0.03, <italic>p</italic> &lt; 0.001; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2a and c</xref>).

Importantly, we show that individuals who experienced more task-induced anxiety avoid actions that lead to aversive outcomes, at the cost of potential reward. Computational modelling of behaviour revealed that this was explained by relative sensitivity to punishment over reward. However, this effect was limited to task-induced anxiety, and was only evident on a self-report measure of <italic>general</italic> avoidance in our first sample. Finally, split-half and test-retest analyses of the task indicated fair-to-excellent reliability indices of task behaviour and model parameters. These results demonstrate the potential of approach-avoidance reinforcement learning tasks as translational measures of anxiety-related avoidance.</p><p>We can evaluate the translational validity of our task based on the criteria of face, construct, predictive, and computational validity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib78">Willner, 1984</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib55">Redish et al., 2022</xref>). The task shows sufficient face validity when compared to the Vogel/Geller-Seifter conflict tests; the design involves a series of choices between an action associated with high reward and punishment, or low reward and no punishment, and these contingencies must be learned. One potentially important difference is that our task involved a choice between two active options, referred to as a two-alternative forced choice (2AFC), whereas in the Vogel/Geller-Seifter tests, animals are free to perform an action (e.g. press the lever) or withhold the action (don’t press the lever; i.e. a go/no-go design). The disadvantage of the latter approach is that human participants can and typically do show motor response biases (i.e. for either action or inaction), which can confound value-based response biases with approach or avoidance (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Guitart-Masip et al., 2012</xref>). Fortunately, there is ample evidence that rodents can perform 2AFC learning (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib43">Metha et al., 2019</xref>) and conflict tasks (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib65">Simon et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib48">Oberrauch et al., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Glover et al., 2020</xref>). That avoidance responses were positively associated with task-induced anxiety also lends support for the construct validity of our measure, given the theoretical links between anxiety and avoidance under approach-avoidance conflict (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Hayes, 1976</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib68">Stein and Paulus, 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Aupperle and Paulus, 2010</xref>). However, we note that the empirical effect size was small (|<italic>r</italic>|~0.13) – we discuss potential reasons for this below.</p><p>The predictive and computational validity of the task need to be determined in future work. Predictive validity can be assessed by investigating the effects of anxiolytic drugs on task behaviour. Reduced avoidance after anxiolytic drug administration, or indeed any manipulation designed to reduce anxiety, would support our measure’s predictive validity. Similarly, computational validity would also need to be assessed directly in non-human animals by fitting models to their behavioural data. This should be possible even in the face of different procedures across species such as number of trials or outcomes used (shock or aversive sound). We are encouraged by our finding that the winning computational model in our study relies on a relatively simple classical reinforcement learning strategy. There exist many studies showing that non-human animals rely on similar strategies during reward and punishment learning (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib59">Schultz, 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib46">Mobbs et al., 2020</xref>); albeit to our knowledge this has never been modelled in non-human animals where rewards and punishment can occur simultaneously.</p><p>One benefit of designing a task amenable to the computational modelling of behaviour was that we could extract model parameters that represent individual differences in precise cognitive mechanisms. Our model recapitulated individual- and group-level behaviour with high fidelity, and mediation analyses suggested a potential mechanism of how anxiety may induce avoidance, namely through the relative sensitivity to punishment compared to reward. This demonstrates the potential of computational methods in allowing for mechanistic insights into anxiety-related avoidance. Further, we found satisfactory test-retest reliability of the reward-punishment sensitivity index in test-retest analyses, suggesting that the task can be used for within-subject experiments (e.g. on/off medication) to assess the impact of interventions on the mechanisms underlying avoidance.</p><p>The composite nature of the reward-punishment sensitivity index may be important for contextualising prior results of anxiety and outcome sensitivity. The traditional view has long been that anxiety is associated with greater automatic sensitivity to punishments and threats (i.e. that anxious individuals show a negative bias in information processing; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Bishop, 2007</xref>), due to amygdala hypersensitivity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib42">Mathews and Mackintosh, 1998</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Hartley and Phelps, 2012</xref>). However, subsequent studies have found inconsistent findings relative to this hypothesis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Bishop and Gagne, 2018</xref>). We found that, rather than a straightforward link between anxiety and punishment sensitivity, the <italic>relative</italic> sensitivity to punishment over reward provided a better explanation of anxiety’s effect on behaviour. This effect is more in keeping with cognitive accounts of anxiety’s effect on information processing that involve higher-level cognitive functions such as attention and cognitive control, which propose that anxiety involves a global reallocation of resources away from processing positive and towards negative information (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Beck and Clark, 1997</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Cisler and Koster, 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib56">Robinson et al., 2013</xref>), possibly through prefrontal control mechanisms (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Carlisi and Robinson, 2018</xref>). Future studies using experimental manipulations of anxiety will be needed to test the causal role of anxiety on relative sensitivities to punishments versus rewards.</p><p>Since we developed our task with the primary focus on translational validity, its design diverges from other reinforcement learning tasks that involve reward and punishment outcomes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib53">Pike and Robinson, 2022</xref>). One important difference is that we used distinct reinforcers as our reward and punishment outcomes, compared to many studies which use monetary outcomes for both (e.g. earning and losing £1 constitute the reward and punishment, respectively; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib54">Pizzagalli et al., 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Aylward et al., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">Jean-Richard-Dit-Bressel et al., 2021</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib62">Sharp et al., 2022</xref>). Other tasks have been used that induce a conflict between value and motor biases, relying on prepotent biases to approach/move towards rewards and withdraw from punishments, which makes it difficult to approach punishments and withdraw from rewards (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Guitart-Masip et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib45">Mkrtchian et al., 2017</xref>). However, since translational operant conflict tasks typically induce a conflict between different types of outcome (e.g. food and shocks/sugar and quinine pellets; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib73">van den Bos et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib48">Oberrauch et al., 2019</xref>), we felt it was important to implement this feature. One study used monetary rewards and shock-based punishments, but also included four options for participants to choose from on each trial, with rewards and punishments associated with all four options (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib61">Seymour et al., 2012</xref>). This effectively requires participants to maintain eight probability estimates (i.e. reward and punishment at each of the four options) to solve the task, which may be too difficult for non-human animals to learn efficiently.</p><p>Notably, although a recent computational meta-analysis of reinforcement learning studies showed that symptoms of anxiety and depression are associated with elevated punishment learning rates (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib53">Pike and Robinson, 2022</xref>), we did not observe this pattern in our data. Indeed, we even found the contrary effect in relation to task-induced anxiety, specifically that anxiety was associated with lower rates of learning from punishment. However, other work has suggested that the direction of this effect can depend on the form of anxiety, where cognitive anxiety may be associated with elevated learning rates, but somatic anxiety may show the opposite pattern (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib79">Wise and Dolan, 2020</xref>) and this may explain the discrepancy in findings. Additionally, parameter values are highly dependent on task design (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Eckstein et al., 2022</xref>), and study designs to date may be more optimised in detecting differences in learning rate (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib53">Pike and Robinson, 2022</xref>) – future work is needed to better understand the potentially complex association between anxiety and punishment learning rate. Lastly, as punishment learning rate was severely unreliable in the test-retest analyses, and the associations between punishment learning rate and state anxiety were not robust to an alternative method of parameter estimation (VBI), the negative correlation observed in our study should be treated with caution.</p><p>One potentially important limitation of our findings is the small effect size observed in the correlation between task-induced anxiety and avoidance (Kendall’s tau values &lt; 0.1, mediation coefficients &lt; 0.01). This may be attributed to the simplicity of using overall choice proportion as a measure of approach/avoidance, as the effect of anxiety on choice was also influenced by punishment probability. This may have also been due to the aversiveness of the punishment outcomes (aversive sounds) used in our study, compared to other studies which included aversive images (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Aupperle et al., 2011</xref>), shocks (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib71">Talmi et al., 2009</xref>), or used virtual reality (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Biedermann et al., 2017</xref>) to provide negative reinforcement. Using more salient punishments would likely produce larger effects. Further, whilst we included tests to check whether participants were wearing headphones for this online study, we could not be certain that the sounds were not played over speakers and/or played at a sufficiently high volume to be aversive. Finally, it may simply be that the relationships between psychiatric symptoms and behaviour are small due to the inherent variability of individuals, the lack of precision of self-reported symptoms, or the unreliability of mental health diagnoses (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Freedman et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib80">Wise et al., 2023</xref>). Despite these limitations, an advantage of using web-based auditory stimuli is their efficiency in scaling with sample size, as only a web-browser is needed to complete the task. This is especially relevant for psychiatric research, given the need for studies with larger sample sizes in the field (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib58">Rutledge et al., 2019</xref>).</p><p>Relatedly, participants had some control over the intensity at which the punishments were presented, which may have driven our findings relating to anxiety and putative mechanisms of anxiety-related avoidance. Sensitivity analyses showed that our finding that anxiety is positively associated with avoidance in the task was robust to individual differences in self-reported punishment unpleasantness, whilst the mediation effects were not. Future work imposing better control over the stimuli presented, and/or using within-subjects designs will be needed to validate the role of reward/punishment sensitivities in anxiety-related avoidance.</p><p>The punishment learning rate was severely unreliable given a model-derived correlation across sessions of <italic>r</italic> = –0.45, whereas the other indices of task performance showed fair-to-excellent reliability. This might be a result of practice effects, where participants learned about the punishments differently across sessions, but not about the rewards. Alternatively, as participants self-determined the loudness of the punishments, differences in volume settings across sessions may have impacted the reliability of this parameter (and indeed other measures). Further, the asymmetric nature of the task may have impacted our ability to estimate the punishment learning rate, as there were fewer occurrences of the punishment compared to the reward. However, given that the sensitivity parameters were more important for explaining how anxiety affected avoidance, the low observed reliability of the punishment learning rate may not present a barrier for future use of this task in repeated-measures designs.</p><p>We also did not find any significant correlations between task performance and clinical symptoms of anxiety, which raises questions around the predictive validity of the task. As participants were recruited without imposing specific inclusion/exclusion criteria related to mental health, the low level of clinically relevant symptoms in the data may have contributed to these results. Further studies in samples with high levels of anxiety or examining individuals at the extreme ends of symptom distributions may offer increased sensitivity in assessing the predictive validity of the task. Further, it is worth noting that many animal paradigms were developed and widely adopted due to their sensitivity to anxiolytic medication (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Cryan and Holmes, 2005</xref>). Given the lack of associations with clinical measures in our results, it is possible that current translational models of anxiety may not fully capture behaviours that are directly relevant to pathological anxiety. To develop translational paradigms of clinical utility, future research should place a stronger emphasis on assessing their clinical validity in humans. Using multi-level or continuous outcomes would also improve the ecological validity of the present approach and interpretation of the sensitivity indices.</p><p>Finally, whilst there is a broad literature on the roles of behavioural inhibition and avoidance tendency traits on decision-making and behaviour (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Gray, 1982</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Carver and White, 1994</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Corr, 2004</xref>), we did not replicate the correlation of experiential avoidance and avoidance responses or the reward-punishment sensitivity index. Since there were also no significant correlations across task performance indices and clinical symptom measures, our findings suggest that the measure may be more sensitive to behaviours relating to state anxiety, rather more stable traits. Nevertheless, how performance in the present task relates to other traits such as behavioural approach/inhibition tendencies (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Carver and White, 1994</xref>), as has been found in previous studies on reward/punishment learning (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib79">Wise and Dolan, 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib62">Sharp et al., 2022</xref>) and approach-avoidance conflict (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Aupperle et al., 2011</xref>), will be an important question for future work.</p><sec id="s3-1"><title>Conclusion</title><p>Avoidance is a hallmark symptom of anxiety-related disorders and there is a need for better translational models of avoidance. In our novel translational task designed to involve the same computational processes as those involved in non-human animal tests, anxiety was reliably induced, associated with avoidance behaviour, and linked to a computational model of behaviour. We hope that similar approaches will facilitate progress in the theoretical understanding of avoidance and ultimately aid in the development of novel anxiolytic treatments for anxiety-related disorders.</p></sec></sec><sec id="s4" sec-type="methods"><title>Methods</title><sec id="s4-1"><title>Participants</title><p>We recruited participants from Prolific (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://www.prolific.com/">https://www.prolific.com/</ext-link>). Participants had to be aged 18–60, speak English as their first language, have no language-related disorders/literacy difficulties, have no vision/hearing difficulties/have no mild cognitive impairment or dementia, and be resident in the UK. Participants were reimbursed at a rate of £7.50 per hour, and could earn a bonus of up to an additional £7.50 per hour based on their performance on the task. The study had ethical approval from the University College London Research Ethics Committee (ID 15253/001).</p><p>We first recruited a discovery sample to investigate whether anxiety was associated with avoidance in the novel task. We conducted an a priori power analysis to detect a minimally interesting correlation between anxiety and avoidance of <italic>r</italic> = 0.15 (alpha<sub>two-tailed</sub>=0.05, power = 0.80), resulting in a required sample size of 346. We aimed to replicate our initial finding (that task-induced anxiety was associated with the model-derived measure of approach-avoidance bias) in a replication sample. In the initial sample, the size of this effect was Kendall’s <italic>τ</italic> = 0.099, which approximates to a Pearson’s <italic>r</italic> of 0.15 – this was the basis for the power analysis for the replication sample. Therefore, the power analysis was configured to detect a correlation of <italic>r</italic> = 0.15 (alpha<sub>one-tailed</sub>=0.05, power = 0.95), resulting in a required sample size of n = 476. A total of 423 participants completed the initial study (mean age = 38, SD = 10, 59% female), and 726 participants completed the replication study (mean age = 34, SD = 10, 51% female).</p></sec><sec id="s4-2"><title>Headphone screen and calibration</title><p>We used aversive auditory stimuli as our punishments in the reinforcement learning task, which consisted of combinations of female screams and high-frequency tones that were individually rated as highly aversive in a previous online study (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib60">Seow and Hauser, 2022</xref>). The stimuli can be found online at <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://osf.io/m3zev/">https://osf.io/m3zev/</ext-link>. To maximise their aversiveness, we asked participants to use headphones whilst they completed the task. All participants completed an open-source, validated auditory discrimination task (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib81">Woods et al., 2017</xref>) to screen out those who were unlikely to be using headphones. Participants could only continue to the main task if they achieved an accuracy threshold of five out of six trials in this screening task.</p><p>To further increase the aversiveness of the punishments, we wanted each participant to hear them at a loud volume. We initially used a calibration task to increase the system volume and implemented attention checks in the main task to ensure that participants had kept the volume at a sufficiently high level during the task (see below). Before beginning the calibration task, participants were advised to set their system volume to around 10% of the maximum possible. Then, we presented two alternating auditory stimuli: a burst of white noise which was set to have the same volume as the aversive sounds in the main task, and a spoken number played at a lower volume to one ear (‘one’, ‘two’, or ‘three’; these stimuli are also available online at <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://osf.io/m3zev/">https://osf.io/m3zev/</ext-link>). We instructed participants to adjust their system volume so that the white noise was loud but comfortable. At the same time, they also had to press the number key on their keyboard corresponding to the number spoken between each white noise presentation. The rationale for the difference in volume was to fix a lower boundary for each participant’s system volume, so that the volume of the punishments presented in the main task was locked above this boundary. We used the white noise as a placeholder for the punishments to limit desensitisation. Since the volume of the punishments, and therefore at least in part their aversiveness, was determined by the participants themselves, we conducted sensitivity analyses on all reported findings after accounting for self-reported unpleasantness ratings for the punishment – this did not materially affect our main findings (see Appendix 9).</p></sec><sec id="s4-3"><title>The approach-avoidance reinforcement learning task</title><p>We developed a novel task on which participants learned to simultaneously pursue rewards and avoid punishments. On each trial, participants had 2 seconds to choose one of two options, depicted as distinct visual stimuli (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2a</xref>), using the left/right arrow keys on their keyboard. The chosen option was then highlighted by a white border, and participants were presented with the outcome for that trial for 2 seconds. This could be one of (1) no outcome, (2) a reward (an animated coin image), (3) a punishment (an aversive sound), or (4) both the reward and punishment. We incentivised participants to collect the coins by informing them that they could earn a bonus payment based on the number of coins earned during the task. If no choice was made, the text ‘Too slow!’ was shown for 2 seconds and the trial was skipped. Participants completed 200 trials which took 10 minutes on average across the sample. Each option was associated with separate probabilities of producing the reward/aversive sound outcomes (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2b</xref>), and these probabilities fluctuated randomly over trials. Both options were associated with the reward, but only one was associated with the punishment (i.e. the ‘conflict’ option could produce both rewards and punishments, but the ‘safe’ option could produce only rewards and never punishments). When asked to rate the unpleasantness of the punishments from ‘Not at all’ to ‘Extremely’ (scored from 0 to 50, respectively), participants gave a mean rating of 31.7 (SD = 12.8).</p><p>The latent outcome probabilities were generated as decaying Gaussian random walks in a similar fashion to previous restless bandit tasks (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Daw et al., 2006</xref>), where the probability, p, of observing outcome, <inline-formula><mml:math id="inf12"><mml:mi>o</mml:mi></mml:math></inline-formula>, at option, <inline-formula><mml:math id="inf13"><mml:mi>i</mml:mi></mml:math></inline-formula>, on trial, <inline-formula><mml:math id="inf14"><mml:mi>t</mml:mi></mml:math></inline-formula>, drifted according to the following:<disp-formula id="equ1"><mml:math id="m1"><mml:mrow><mml:msub><mml:mrow><mml:mi mathvariant="normal">p</mml:mi></mml:mrow><mml:mrow><mml:mi>i</mml:mi><mml:mo>,</mml:mo><mml:mi>o</mml:mi></mml:mrow></mml:msub><mml:mrow><mml:mo>(</mml:mo><mml:mrow><mml:mi>t</mml:mi><mml:mo>+</mml:mo><mml:mn>1</mml:mn></mml:mrow><mml:mo>)</mml:mo></mml:mrow><mml:mo>=</mml:mo><mml:mi>λ</mml:mi><mml:msub><mml:mrow><mml:mi mathvariant="normal">p</mml:mi></mml:mrow><mml:mrow><mml:mi>i</mml:mi><mml:mo>,</mml:mo><mml:mi>o</mml:mi></mml:mrow></mml:msub><mml:mrow><mml:mo>(</mml:mo><mml:mi>t</mml:mi><mml:mo>)</mml:mo></mml:mrow><mml:mo>+</mml:mo><mml:mrow><mml:mo>(</mml:mo><mml:mrow><mml:mn>1</mml:mn><mml:mo>−</mml:mo><mml:mi>λ</mml:mi></mml:mrow><mml:mo>)</mml:mo></mml:mrow><mml:mi>θ</mml:mi><mml:mo>+</mml:mo><mml:mi>e</mml:mi></mml:mrow></mml:math></disp-formula><disp-formula id="equ2"><mml:math id="m2"><mml:mrow><mml:mi>e</mml:mi><mml:mo>∼</mml:mo><mml:mtext>N</mml:mtext><mml:mrow><mml:mo>(</mml:mo><mml:mrow><mml:mn>0</mml:mn><mml:mo>,</mml:mo><mml:msup><mml:mn>0.04</mml:mn><mml:mrow><mml:mn>2</mml:mn></mml:mrow></mml:msup></mml:mrow><mml:mo>)</mml:mo></mml:mrow></mml:mrow></mml:math></disp-formula></p><p>The decay parameter, <inline-formula><mml:math id="inf15"><mml:mi>λ</mml:mi></mml:math></inline-formula>, was set to 0.97, which pulled all values towards the decay centre <inline-formula><mml:math id="inf16"><mml:mi>θ</mml:mi></mml:math></inline-formula>, which was set to 0.5. The random noise, <inline-formula><mml:math id="inf17"><mml:mi>e</mml:mi></mml:math></inline-formula><italic>,</italic> added on each trial was drawn from a zero-mean Gaussian with a standard deviation of 0.04. All probabilities of observing the reward at the safe option were scaled down by a factor of 0.7 so that it was less rewarding than the conflict option, on average. We initialised each walk at the following values: conflict option reward probability – 0.7, safe option reward probability – 0.35, conflict option punishment probability – 0.2. We only used sets of latent outcome probabilities where the cross-correlations across each probability walk were below 0.3. A total of four sets of outcome probabilities were used across our studies – they are available online at <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://osf.io/m3zev/">https://osf.io/m3zev/</ext-link>.</p><p>We implemented three auditory attention checks during the main task, to ensure that participants were still using an appropriate volume to listen to the auditory stimuli. As participants could potentially mute their device during the outcome phase of the trial only (i.e. only when the aversive sounds could occur), the timing of these checks had to coincide with moment of outcome presentation. Therefore, we implemented these checks at the outcome phase of two randomly selected trials where the participants’ choices led to no outcome (no reward or punishment), and also once at the very end of the task. Specifically, we played one of the spoken numbers used during the calibration task (see above) and the participant had 2.5 seconds to respond using the corresponding number key on their keyboard.</p><p>Immediately after the task and the final attention check, we obtained subjective ratings about the task using the following questions: ‘How unpleasant did you find the sounds?’ and ‘How anxious did you feel during the task?’. Responses were measured on a continuous slider ranging from ‘Not at all’ (0) to ‘Extremely’ (50).</p></sec><sec id="s4-4"><title>Data cleaning</title><p>As the task was implemented online where we could not ensure the same testing standards as we could in-person, we used three exclusion criteria to improve data quality. Firstly, we excluded participants who missed a response to more than one auditory attention check (see above; 8% in both discovery and replication samples) – as these occurred infrequently and the stimuli used for the checks were played at relatively low volume, we allowed for incorrect responses so long as a response was made. Secondly, we excluded those who responded with the same response key on 20 or more consecutive trials (&gt;10% of all trials; 4%/6% in discovery and replication samples, respectively) – note that as the options randomly switched sides on the screen across trials, this did not exclude participants who frequently and consecutively chose a certain option. Lastly, we excluded those who did not respond on 20 or more trials (1%/2% in discovery and replication samples, respectively). Overall, we excluded 51 out of 423 (12%) in the discovery sample, and 98 out of 725 (14%) in the replication sample. We conducted all the analyses with and without these exclusions. These exclusions had no effects on the main findings reported in the manuscript, and differences before and after excluding data are reported in Appendix 1.</p></sec><sec id="s4-5"><title>Mixed-effects regressions of trial-by-trial choice</title><p>We specified two hierarchical logistic regression models to test the effect of the dynamic outcome probabilities on choice.

All prior distributions of the untransformed parameter values were set as Gaussian distributions to regularise fitting and to limit extreme values. Parameters were transformed within the models, via the sigmoid function for parameters constrained to values between 0 and 1; or exponentiated for strictly positive parameters. We compared evidence across models using integrated Bayesian information criterion (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Huys et al., 2011</xref>) which integrates both model likelihood and model complexity into a single measure for model comparison.</p></sec></sec><sec id="s4-7"><title>Mediation analysis of anxiety-related avoidance</title><p>To investigate the cognitive processes underlying anxiety-related avoidance, we tested for potential mediators of the effect of task-induced anxiety on avoidance choices in the approach-avoidance reinforcement learning task. Mediation was assessed using structural equation modelling with the ‘lavaan’ package in R (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib57">Rosseel, 2012</xref>). This allowed us to test multiple potential mediators within a single model. We used maximum-likelihood estimation with and without bootstrapped standard errors (using 2000 bootstrap samples) for estimation. The potential mediators were any parameters from our computational model that significantly correlated with task-induced anxiety. Therefore, the model included the following variables: task-induced anxiety, avoidance choices (computed as the proportion of safe option choices for each participant), and model parameters which correlated with task-induced anxiety. The model was constructed such that the model parameters were parallel mediators of the effect of task-induced anxiety on avoidance choices. The model parameters were allowed to covary with one another.</p></sec><sec id="s4-8"><title>Symptom questionnaires</title><p>Psychiatric symptoms were measured using the Generalised Anxiety Disorder scale (GAD7; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib66">Spitzer et al., 2006</xref>), Patient Health Questionnaire depression scale (PHQ8; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib40">Kroenke et al., 2009</xref>), and the Brief Experiential Avoidance Questionnaire (BEAQ; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Gámez et al., 2014</xref>).</p></sec><sec id="s4-9"><title>Test-retest reliability analysis</title><p>We retested a subset of our sample (n = 57) to assess the reliability of our task. We determined our sample size via an a priori power analysis using GPower (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Faul et al., 2007</xref>), which was set to detect the smallest meaningful effect size of <italic>r</italic> = 0.4, as any lower test-retest correlations are considered poor by convention (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Fleiss, 1986</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Cicchetti, 1994</xref>). The required sample size was thus 50 participants, based on a one-tailed significance threshold of 0.05 and 90% power. Participants were recruited from Prolific. We invited participants from the replication study (providing they had not been excluded on the basis of data quality) to complete the study again, at least 10 days after their first session. The retest version of the approach-avoidance reinforcement learning task was identical to that in the first session, except for the use of new stimuli to represent the conflict and safe options and different latent outcome probabilities to limit practice effects.</p><p>We calculated ICCs coefficients to assess the reliability of our model-agnostic measures. Specifically, we used consistency-based ICC(3,1) (following the notation of <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib63">Shrout and Fleiss, 1979</xref>). To estimate the reliability of the model-derived measures, we estimated individual- and session-level model parameters via a joint model in an approach recently shown to improve the accuracy of estimating reliability (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib75">Waltmann et al., 2022</xref>). Briefly, this involved fitting behavioural data from both test and retest sessions per participant in a single model, but specifying unique parameters per session. Since our fitting algorithm assumes parameters are drawn from a multivariate Gaussian distribution, information about the reliability of the parameters can be derived from the covariance of each parameter across time. These covariance values can subsequently be converted to Pearson’s <italic>r</italic> values, and thus indices of reliability.</p></sec><sec id="s4-10"><title>Materials availability statement</title><p>The data and code required to replicate the data analyses are available online at <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://osf.io/m3zev/">https://osf.io/m3zev/</ext-link>.</p></sec></sec></body><back><sec sec-type="additional-information" id="s5"><title>Additional information</title><fn-group content-type="competing-interest"><title>Competing interests</title><fn fn-type="COI-statement" id="conf1"><p>No competing interests declared</p></fn><fn fn-type="COI-statement" id="conf2"><p>OJR's MRC senior fellowship is partially in collaboration with Cambridge Cognition Ltd (who plan to provide in-kind contribution) and he is running an investigator-initiated trial with medication donated by Lundbeck (escitalopram and placebo, no financial contribution).

The task is a two-armed bandit where one choice is 'safer' - has no probability of punishment, delivered as an aversive sound, but also lower probability of reward - and the other choice involves a reward-punishment conflict. The authors fit a computational model of reinforcement learning to this task and found that self-reported state anxiety during the task was related to a greater likelihood of choosing the safe stimulus when the other (conflict) stimulus had a higher likelihood of punishment. Computationally, this was represented by a smaller value for the ratio of reward to punishment sensitivity in people with higher task-induced anxiety. They replicated this finding, but not another finding that this behavior was related to a measure of psychopathology (experiential avoidance), in a second sample. They also tested test-retest reliability in a sub-sample tested twice, one week apart and found that some aspects of task behavior had acceptable levels of reliability. The introduction makes a strong appeal to back-translation and computational validity. The task design is clever and most methods are solid - it is encouraging to see attempts to validate tasks as they are developed. The lack of replicated effects with psychopathology may mean that this task is better suited to assess state anxiety, or to serve as a foundation for additional task development.</p></body></sub-article><sub-article article-type="referee-report" id="sa2"><front-stub><article-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.87720.4.sa2</article-id><title-group><article-title>Reviewer #2 (Public Review):</article-title></title-group><contrib-group><contrib contrib-type="author"><anonymous/><role specific-use="referee">Reviewer</role></contrib></contrib-group></front-stub><body><p>Summary:</p><p>The authors develop a computational approach-avoidance-conflict (AAC) task, designed to overcome the limitations of existing offer based AAC tasks. The task incorporated likelihoods of receiving rewards/ punishments that would be learned by the participants to ensure computational validity and estimated model parameters related to reward/punishment and task induced anxiety. Two independent samples of online participants were tested. In both samples participants who experienced greater task induced anxiety avoided choices associated with greater probability of punishment. Computational modelling revealed that this effect was explained by greater individual sensitivities to punishment relative to rewards.</p><p>Strengths:</p><p>Large internet-based samples, with discovery sample (n = 369), pre-registered replication sample (n = 629) and test-retest sub group (n = 57). Extensive compliance measures (e.g. audio checks) seek to improve adherence.</p><p>There is a great need for RL tasks that model threatening outcomes rather than simply loss of reward. The main model parameters show strong effects and the additional indices with task based anxiety are a useful extension. Associations were broadly replicated across samples. Fair to excellent reliability of model parameters is encouraging and badly needed for behavioral tasks of threat sensitivity.</p><p>The task seems to have lower approach bias than some other AAC tasks in the literature.</p><p>Appraisal and impact:</p><p>Overall this is a very strong paper, describing a novel task that could help move the field of RL forward to take account of threat processing more fully. The large sample size with discovery, replication and test-retest gives confidence in the findings. The task has good ecological validity and associations with task-based anxiety and clinical self-report demonstrate clinical relevance. Test-retest of the punishment learning parameter is the only real concern. Overall this task provides an exciting new probe of reward/threat that could be used in mechanistic disease models.</p><p>Additional context:</p><p>The sex differences between the samples are interesting as effects of sex are commonly found in AAC tasks. It would be interesting to look at the main model comparison with sex included as a covariate.</p></body></sub-article><sub-article article-type="referee-report" id="sa3"><front-stub><article-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.87720.4.sa3</article-id><title-group><article-title>Reviewer #3 (Public Review):</article-title></title-group><contrib-group><contrib contrib-type="author"><anonymous/><role specific-use="referee">Reviewer</role></contrib></contrib-group></front-stub><body><p>This study investigated cognitive mechanisms underlying approach-avoidance behavior using a novel reinforcement learning task and computational modelling. Participants could select a risky &quot;conflict&quot; option (latent, fluctuating probabilities of monetary reward and/or unpleasant sound [punishment]) or a safe option (separate, generally lower probability of reward). Overall, participant choices were skewed towards more rewarded options, but were also repelled by increasing probability of punishment. Individual patterns of behavior were well-captured by a reinforcement learning model that included parameters for reward and punishment sensitivity, and learning rates for reward and punishment. This is a nice replication of existing findings suggesting reward and punishment have opposing effects on behavior through dissociated sensitivity to reward versus punishment.</p><p>Interestingly, avoidance of the conflict option was predicted by self-reported task-induced anxiety. Importantly, when a subset of participants were retested over 1 week later, most behavioral tendencies and model parameters were recapitulated, suggesting the task may capture stable traits relevant to approach-avoidance decision-making.</p><p>The revised paper commendably adds important additional information and analyses to support these claims. The initial concern that not accounting for participant control over punisher intensity confounded interpretation of effects has been largely addressed in follow-up analyses and discussion.</p><p>This study complements and sits within a broad translational literature investigating interactions between reward/punishers and psychological processes in approach-avoidance decisions.</p></body></sub-article><sub-article article-type="author-comment" id="sa4"><front-stub><article-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.87720.4.sa4</article-id><title-group><article-title>Author Response</article-title></title-group><contrib-group><contrib contrib-type="author"><name><surname>Yamamori</surname><given-names>Yumeya</given-names></name><role specific-use="author">Author</role><aff><institution>University College London</institution><addr-line><named-content content-type="city">London</named-content></addr-line><country>United Kingdom</country></aff></contrib><contrib contrib-type="author"><name><surname>Robinson</surname><given-names>Oliver J</given-names></name><role specific-use="author">Author</role><aff><institution>University College London</institution><addr-line><named-content content-type="city">London</named-content></addr-line><country>United Kingdom</country></aff></contrib><contrib contrib-type="author"><name><surname>Roiser</surname><given-names>Jonathan P</given-names></name><role specific-use="author">Author</role><aff><institution>University College London</institution><addr-line><named-content content-type="city">London</named-content></addr-line><country>United Kingdom</country></aff></contrib></contrib-group></front-stub><body><p>The following is the authors’ response to the previous reviews</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p><bold>Reviewer #1:</bold></p><p>Comment on revised manuscript: Thank you for your responses - they have addressed most of my concerns.</p></disp-quote><p>We thank the reviewer again for their assistance in improving our manuscript.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p><bold>Reviewer #2:</bold></p><p>Additional context:</p><p>The sex differences between the samples are interesting as effects of sex are commonly found in AAC tasks. It would be interesting to look at the main model comparison with sex included as a covariate.</p></disp-quote><p>Firstly, we thank the reviewer for their re-evaluation of our manuscript.</p><p>To the reviewer’s comment, we apologise for the lack of clarity. The analyses included in our revision were indeed based on the main logistic regression model of choice, including sex and age as covariates. We have clarified this in the manuscript as follows:</p><p><italic>While sex was significantly associated with choice in the hierarchical logistic regression in the discovery sample (β = 0.16 ± 0.07, p = 0.028) with males being more likely to choose the conflict option, this pattern was not evident in the replication sample (β = 0.08 ± 0.06, p = 0.173), and age was not associated with choice in either sample (p &gt; 0.2).</italic></p><p>As it is difficult to include sex as a covariate in the reinforcement learning models in the classical sense as in a linear regression, we assessed sex effects on the individual parameters produced by these models instead, as follows:</p><p><italic>Comparing parameters across sexes via Welch’s t-tests revealed significant differences in reward sensitivity (t289 = -2.87, p = 0.004, d = 0.34; lower in females) and consequently reward-punishment sensitivity index (t336 = -2.03, p = 0.043, d = 0.22; lower in females i.e. more avoidance-driven). In the replication sample, we observed the same effect on reward-punishment sensitivity index (t626 = -2.79, p = 0.005, d = 0.22; lower in females). However, the sex difference in reward sensitivity did not replicate (p = 0.441), although we did observe a significant sex difference in punishment sensitivity in the replication sample (t626 = 2.26, p = 0.024, d = 0.18).</italic></p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Could the authors double check the mean/SD of approach in each group for typos? The numbers are identical.</p></disp-quote><p>Thank you for spotting this – the means were indeed similar (discovery: 0.521, replication: 0.516), but the standard deviations were marginally different (discovery: 0.140, replication: 0.148). We have amended the manuscript to reflect this, as follows:</p><p><italic>Across individuals, there was considerable variability in overall choice proportions (discovery sample: mean = 0.52, SD = 0.14, min/max = [0.03, 0.96]; replication sample: mean = 0.52, SD = 0.15, min/max = [0.01, 0.99]).</italic></p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p><bold>Reviewer #3:</bold></p><p>The revised paper commendably adds important additional information and analyses to support these claims. The initial concern that not accounting for participant control over punisher intensity confounded interpretation of effects has been largely addressed in follow-up analyses and discussion.</p><p>I commend the authors on their revisions. My initial concerns have been largely addressed. Minor suggestions below.</p></disp-quote><p>We thank the reviewer again for their assistance in improving our analyses and manuscript.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Changing the visualisation of the logistic regression model in Figure 2 to tertiles instead of quartiles seems expedient, and does not properly address the points raised by the other reviewers. The argument that non-linear trends in the extreme bins are due to less data is plausible, but unsatisfying given how reliable the pattern seems to be (across samples, with small standard error) and . It is possible, albeit perplexing, that the influence of punishment probability on choice is non-linear. I think the current figure with tertiles is acceptable, but I would suggest including the figures with non-linear data as a supplementary figure, for sake of transparency and reader interest.</p></disp-quote><p>We agree that this is likely more complex than a simple linear effect (in the logistic space), especially given the concurrent reward probabilities which also fluctuate in the task. We also agree that the non-linear figures should be made available in the interests of transparency, and have included them in the Supplementary Materials.</p><p>We direct interested readers to the relevant section from the figure legend as follows:</p><p><italic>&quot;Figure 2. Predictors of choice in the approach-avoidance reinforcement learning task. … We show linear curves here since these effects were estimated as linear effects in the logistic regression models, however the raw data showed non-linear trends – see Supplementary Figure 15.&quot;</italic></p><p>We have included the non-linear figures in Supplementary Section 9.11 Effects of outcome probabilities on choice in the task: non-linear effects as Supplementary Figure 15.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>As an aside, the argument that approach-avoidance joystick tasks do not have a non-human counterpart misconstrues the translational root of these tasks, which was (at least in part) an attempt to model (successfully or not) general approach/avoidance processes measured in non-human tasks, e.g. appetitive/aversive runway tasks using rodents.</p></disp-quote><p>Our aim in this manuscript was to develop a task that was closely matched to non-human counterparts in both the experimental procedure (choice over reward/punishment outcomes) and cognitive process involved (simultaneous reward/punishment learning). With this in mind, we wanted to convey that non-human and human measures of approach/avoidance processes were historically distinct in terms of the procedures (e.g. using a joystick vs navigating a runway, due to ethological differences), and that this was potentially problematic with respect to computational validity. However, at this early point in the introduction, it was unnecessary to make a strong distinction between these tasks, which as the reviewer duly notes, follow similar approach/avoidance principles and share similar experimental roots. Therefore, we have opted to omit the reference to translational similarity in the relevant text, as follows:</p><p><italic>In humans, on the other hand, approach-avoidance conflict has historically been measured using questionnaires such as the Behavioural Inhibition/Activation Scale (Carver and White 1994), or cognitive tasks that rely on motor/response time biases, for example by using joysticks to approach/move towards positive stimuli and avoid/move away from negative stimuli (Guitart-Masip, Huys et al. 2012, Phaf, Mohr et al. 2014, Kirlic, Young et al. 2017, Mkrtchian, Aylward et al. 2017).</italic></p></body></sub-article></article>
