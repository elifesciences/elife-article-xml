This is most clearly exemplified by the motor symptoms of Parkinson Disease (PD), in which brain dopamine levels are reduced. PD is defined by tremor, rigidity, bradykinesia, and postural instability. Bradykinesia and rigidity consistently improve with dopamine replacement, although tremor and postural instability may not. PD patients also experience significant disability from impaired manual dexterity, which causes difficulty with tasks like tying shoelaces, fastening buttons, and handwriting (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib57">Pohar and Allyson Jones, 2009</xref>). This symptom is distinct from bradykinesia (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Foki et al., 2016</xref>), but also responds to dopamine replacement (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Gebhardt et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib43">Lee et al., 2018</xref>). Thus, dopamine plays an important, but poorly defined, role in dexterous skill beyond simply regulating movement speed or amplitude.</p><p>Two leading hypotheses regarding the role of dopamine in motor control are that it ‘invigorates’ movement and regulates motor learning. The ‘vigor’ hypothesis derives from the exquisite dopa-responsiveness of bradykinesia in PD and is supported by extensive experimental evidence. Intrastriatal infusion of dopamine agonists increases locomotion, and both electrical and optogenetic stimulation of midbrain dopamine neurons cause contraversive turning (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Arbuthnott and Ungerstedt, 1975</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib62">Saunders et al., 2018</xref>). Dopamine signaling increases near movement onset and acceleration bouts (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Coddington and Dudman, 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">Howe and Dombeck, 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">Jin and Costa, 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib63">Schultz et al., 1983</xref>) and is correlated with movement velocity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Barter et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib62">Saunders et al., 2018</xref>). Conversely, dopamine depletion and dopamine receptor blockade slow movement (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib46">Leventhal et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib53">Panigrahi et al., 2015</xref>). These studies used scalar readouts that reflect ‘vigor’ (e.g. movement velocity or numbers of rotations), and therefore could not assess dopaminergic influences on multi-joint coordination.</p><p>Dopaminergic roles in reinforcement learning may contribute to ‘non-vigor’ aspects of motor control. Phasic dopamine release patterns are broadly consistent with ‘reward prediction error’ (RPE) signals, or the difference in value between anticipated and realized behavioral states (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Glimcher, 2011</xref>). In reinforcement learning models, the RPE is used to adjust subsequent behavior. While the details of dopamine’s role in implicit learning remain to be fully elucidated (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib64">Schultz, 2019</xref>), dopamine signaling clearly influences synaptic plasticity and alters future behavior (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Dowd and Dunnett, 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib46">Leventhal et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib50">Mohebi et al., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib54">Parker et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib66">Shen et al., 2008</xref>). Most evidence for ‘learning’ models of dopamine function come from behavioral tasks that require no movement (e.g. classical conditioning, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib68">Tobler et al., 2005</xref>), simple movements (e.g. lever presses, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib54">Parker et al., 2016</xref>), or innate movements (e.g. locomotion, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">Howe and Dombeck, 2016</xref>). For the most part, such tasks have discrete outcomes (e.g. push the right or left lever, initiate locomotion or not). However, dopaminergic roles in instrumental and classical conditioning may extend to tasks with more degrees of freedom. In support of this hypothesis, dopamine neuron firing patterns consistent with RPEs (more accurately, performance prediction errors) are observed in songbirds receiving distorted audio feedback (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Gadagkar et al., 2016</xref>). In mice, rotarod performance worsens gradually during dopamine receptor blockade, and improves gradually when the blockade is released (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Beeler et al., 2012</xref>). These results could be explained by dopamine reinforcing specific, successful actions (e.g. paw adjustments on the rotarod) to gradually improve performance (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Beeler et al., 2013</xref>). Nonetheless, the role of dopamine in skilled, dexterous movements requiring precise multi-joint coordination remains unclear.</p><p>The goal of this study was to determine the effects of precisely timed dopaminergic manipulations on a complex, finely coordinated, and relatively unconstrained motor skill. To do this, we optogenetically stimulated or inhibited midbrain dopamine neurons as rats performed a skilled reaching task. In skilled reaching, rats learn the coordinated forelimb and digit movements to reach for, grasp, and consume sugar pellets. Skilled reaching is readily learned by rats over several sessions (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib40">Klein et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib45">Lemke et al., 2019</xref>), requires precise coordination between the forelimb and digits, and is sensitive to dopamine depletion (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">Hyland et al., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib71">Whishaw et al., 1986</xref>). It is therefore an excellent model for assessing dopaminergic contributions to dexterous skill.</p><p>By combining skilled reaching, optogenetics, and measurement of three-dimensional paw/digit kinematics, we addressed the following questions. First, we asked whether dopamine manipulations affect current or subsequent reaches. If dopamine affects only the current movement, reach kinematics should change immediately with dopamine manipulations. Conversely, if dopamine provides a teaching signal for fine motor coordination, reach kinematics should depend on the history of prior dopaminergic activation. Second, we asked how reach kinematics – specifically coordination between forelimb and digit movements – are influenced by dopamine manipulations. If dopamine plays a purely ‘invigorating’ role in movement, altered dopaminergic signaling should affect only the velocity or amplitude of the reaches.</p><p>Instead of pure vigor or learning roles for dopamine, we found a complex pattern of dopaminergic influences on skilled reaching. Consistent with a motor learning function, reach kinematics changed gradually with repeated dopamine neuron stimulation or inhibition. In addition to simple kinematic measures (e.g. reach amplitude), coordination between paw advancement and digit movements also changed with repeated stimulation/inhibition. However, once established, rats transitioned between aberrant and baseline reach kinematics within a single trial in a dopamine-dependent manner. These results indicate that dopamine has both immediate and long-term effects on motor control beyond simply invigorating movement, with important implications for understanding dopamine-linked movement disorders.</p></sec><sec id="s2" sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><p>We optogenetically stimulated or inhibited substantia nigra pars compacta (SNc) dopamine neurons at specific moments during rat skilled reaching. Tyrosine hydroxylase (TH)-Cre<sup>+</sup> rats were injected bilaterally with a double-floxed channelrhodopsin (ChR2), archaerhodopsin (Arch), or control EYFP construct into SNc (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figures 1A, C and E</xref>). Rats were trained on an automated skilled reaching task that allows synchronization of high-speed video with optogenetics (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Bova et al., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Ellens et al., 2016</xref>). Trials started with rats breaking a photobeam at the back of the chamber, which caused a pellet to be delivered in front of the reaching slot (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1D</xref>). Rats could make multiple reaches until the pellet delivery arm descended 2 s after the video trigger event. Following training, optical fibers were implanted over SNc contralateral to the rat’s preferred reaching paw. Immunohistochemistry confirmed that opsin expression was restricted to TH-expressing neurons in SNc projecting to striatum (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1F</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s3">Figure 1—figure supplement 3</xref>).</p><fig-group><fig id="fig1" position="float"><label>Figure 1.</label><caption><title>Experimental framework.</title><p>(<bold>A</bold>) Timeline for a single experiment.

Animals were tested for an additional 10 days with the same laser stimulation protocol, but with the patch cable-optical fiber junction physically occluded (‘occlusion’ sessions, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1B</xref>). Thus, all cues were identical (e.g., optical shutter noise, visible light) except light penetration into the brain. Reaching performance recovered quickly, but not immediately, to pre-stimulation levels (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2E,G</xref>). However, there was significant variability between rats in the rate of recovery (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s1">Figure 2—figure supplement 1</xref>). On average, recovery to baseline performance was faster than the decline in performance with initial dopamine stimulation (contrast testing, <italic>t</italic>(583.8) = 2.55, p=0.011). This is further evidence that the history of dopaminergic activation influences subsequent skill execution.</p><p>We next asked if dopamine stimulation must occur during reaches to affect success rate. A separate group of ChR2-expressing TH-Cre<sup>+</sup> rats received laser stimulation during the intertrial interval for a duration matched to ‘during reach’ stimulation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1D</xref>, ‘between reach’, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1</xref>). Dopamine neuron stimulation between reaches did not significantly affect the number of trials (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3A</xref>) or success rate (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3B,C</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s1">Figure 3—figure supplements 1</xref>,<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s2">2</xref>). Therefore, dopamine neuron stimulation must occur as the rat is reaching to affect subsequent reaching performance. This result has two important implications. First, it suggests that skill performance depends on the history of striatal dopamine levels specifically during performance of that skill. Second, it argues against the possibility that the effects of dopamine neuron stimulation are due to the gradual accumulation of striatal dopamine.</p><fig-group><fig id="fig3" position="float"><label>Figure 3.</label><caption><title>Dopamine neuron stimulation between reaches does not affect skilled reaching performance.</title><p>(<bold>A</bold>) Average number of trials per session divided by the baseline number of trials for ‘between reach’ stimulation.

Reach extent (how far the paw extended in the direction of the pellet, z<sub>digit2</sub>) became progressively shorter with repeated stimulation during reaches (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6A</xref>, <xref ref-type="video" rid="video1">Videos 1</xref> and <xref ref-type="video" rid="video2">2</xref>). This effect may have been stronger for posteromedially located fibers (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6s1">Figure 6—figure supplement 1</xref>). The progressive change in reach extent occurred both across and within sessions, and did not stabilize until the fifth session of dopamine neuron stimulation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6D</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6s3">Figure 6—figure supplement 3</xref>). Dopamine neuron stimulation during reaches also gradually narrowed grasp aperture at reach end (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6E,F</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6s4">Figure 6—figure supplement 4</xref>), caused the paw to be more pronated at reach end (i.e. θ decreased) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6G,H</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6s5">Figure 6—figure supplement 5</xref>), and decreased the maximum reach velocity (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6I,J</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6s6">Figure 6—figure supplement 6</xref>). Kinematic measures continued to change even when success rate had plateaued (compare <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figures 2E</xref>,<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">6</xref>) due to a ‘floor effect’ for success rate – once the rat consistently misses the pellet, no further changes are detectable by this measure. The decrease in reach extent accounted for much of the drop in success rate (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6s7">Figure 6—figure supplement 7</xref>), although reaches matched for reach extent were still less successful during ‘laser on’ than ‘occlusion’ sessions (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6s8">Figure 6—figure supplement 8</xref>). This suggests that paw transport and grasp-related factors both contributed to reach-to-grasp failures. When dopamine stimulation ceased (‘occlusion’ sessions), reach-to-grasp kinematics rapidly returned to baseline. As with success rate, there was individual variability in how quickly rats returned to pre-stimulation kinematics (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6A,D–J</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6s3">Figure 6—figure supplements 3</xref>–<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6s6">6</xref>). All reach-to-grasp kinematics were unchanged in rats receiving dopamine neuron stimulation between reaches and EYFP control rats (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6B–D,F,H,J</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6s2">Figure 6—figure supplements 2</xref>–<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6s8">8</xref>). In addition to histology, we verified opsin expression and fiber placement by performing ‘during reach’ stimulation in rats previously stimulated between reaches. All rats showed kinematic changes with ‘during reach’ stimulation not observed with ‘between reach’ stimulation. This served as a positive control and reinforces the importance of the timing of dopamine neuron stimulation with respect to specific actions.</p><fig-group><fig id="fig6" position="float"><label>Figure 6.</label><caption><title>Dopamine neuron stimulation induces progressive changes in reach-to-grasp kinematics.</title><p>(<bold>A</bold>) The average maximum reach extent progressively decreased across sessions with ‘during reach’ stimulation.

Maximum reach extent lengthened slightly under dopamine neuron inhibition (that is, the paw extended further past the pellet, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7A,C</xref>, <xref ref-type="video" rid="video3">Videos 3</xref> and <xref ref-type="video" rid="video4">4</xref>), in opposition to the effects of dopamine neuron stimulation. This effect almost reached significance in the linear mixed-effect model (p=0.091, see <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7</xref> caption), but a contrast test comparing laser day 10 to occlusion day one was significant (<italic>t</italic>(37) = −3.24, p=0.003). Furthermore, reach extent consistently lengthened at the individual rat level (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7A</xref>, gray markers) as well as across trials within sessions (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7C</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7s3">Figure 7—figure supplement 3</xref>). Maximum reach velocity also decreased with dopamine inhibition (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7H,I</xref>).

These data suggest that dopamine neuron stimulation and inhibition have roughly opposite effects on reach kinematics. Dopamine neuron inhibition did not significantly affect grasp aperture (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7D,E</xref>) or paw orientation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7F,G</xref>), potentially due to ceiling effects.

Reaches begin when the rat orients to the pellet with its nose, then lifts and aligns its paw at midline with the digits closed. As the forelimb advances towards the pellet, the digits extend and spread while the paw pronates. After the digits close to grasp the pellet, the forelimb and paw are raised and supinated to bring the pellet toward the mouth (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Alaverdashvili and Whishaw, 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib74">Whishaw and Pellis, 1990</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib73">Whishaw et al., 2008</xref>). Because fine motor coordination is impaired in patients with PD, including during reaching-to-grasp (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib72">Whishaw et al., 2002</xref>), we looked to see if the coordination of reach sub-movements was affected by dopamine neuron stimulation or inhibition.</p><p>Dopamine neuron stimulation during reaching altered the coordination of digit spread (aperture) and paw pronation (orientation) with respect to paw advancement (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8">Figures 8</xref>,<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig9">9</xref>). Aperture increased earlier (when the paw was further from the pellet) in ‘during reach’ stimulation sessions compared to ‘retraining’ or ‘occlusion’ sessions (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig9">Figure 9A,B</xref>). Thus, during dopamine stimulation, aperture was smaller at reach end but larger (on average) at matched distances from the pellet (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figures 6C</xref>,<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8">8</xref>,<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig9">9E</xref>). ‘During reach’ dopamine neuron inhibition had the opposite effect – paw aperture began to increase when the paw was closer to the pellet compared to ‘retraining’ or ‘occlusion’ sessions (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig9">Figure 9A,B</xref>). Similar changes occurred with paw orientation: during sessions with dopamine neuron stimulation, paw pronation began further from the pellet (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig9">Figure 9D,E,F</xref>). Dopamine neuron inhibition, however, did not affect the relationship between paw orientation and paw advancement. As for other kinematic effects, the changes in coordination progressed across sessions (most evident in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig9">Figure 9C,F</xref>).

Similarly, reach kinematics required only one trial to switch between normal and aberrant reaching patterns.

Similarly, maximum reach extent and digit aperture immediately increased upon cessation of dopamine neuron stimulation (trial 1, ‘Laser Off’) and remained steady throughout the ‘Laser Off’ block (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig10">Figure 10G,H</xref>).

We predicted that rats with well-placed fibers expressing high levels of ChR2 would develop increasingly worse abnormal involuntary movements (AIMs) as laser intensity increased. To our surprise, rats that subsequently developed markedly abnormal reach kinematics during the skilled reaching task appeared unaffected by dopamine neuron stimulation in the cylinder (AIMs Test 1, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig11">Figure 11</xref>). In ‘post-reaching’ cylinder sessions (AIMS Test 2, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig11">Figure 11</xref>), however, dopamine neuron stimulation elicited markedly abnormal movements (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig11">Figure 11</xref>, <xref ref-type="video" rid="video6">Video 6</xref>). While AIMs were obvious in the context of the cylinder, the same (or higher) stimulation intensities delivered while rats were reaching rarely elicited abnormal movements (other than altered reach kinematics, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig11">Figure 11A</xref>, <xref ref-type="video" rid="video7">Video 7</xref>). Only three of six ‘ChR2 during’ rats exhibited any AIMs superimposed on reaches during ‘laser on’ day 10 (2 rats each with AIMs in 1 of 10 reaches, one rat with AIMs in 5 of 10 reaches), and none exhibited dyskinesias during reaching on laser day 2 when success rate was already near zero. Thus, while dyskinesias likely accounted for some reaching deficits, that was not the primary failure mechanism. Furthermore, rats that did not experience dyskinesias in the cylinder still had markedly reduced reaching success, and rats that experienced dyskinesias could have preserved success rates (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig11s1">Figure 11—figure supplement 1</xref>). Therefore, the expression of dopamine-dependent AIMs depends not only on current levels of dopamine neuron activation, but the history of prior activation and the current behavioral context.</p><fig-group><fig id="fig11" position="float"><label>Figure 11.</label><caption><title>Dopamine neuron stimulation induces context- and history-dependent abnormal involuntary movements.</title><p>(<bold>A</bold>) Average AIMs scores during reaches for ‘ChR2 during’ rats on days 2 and 10 of ‘laser on’ sessions, and day 10 of ‘occlusion’ sessions.

Our results revealed a role for dopamine in motor learning, as repeated dopamine manipulations induced gradual changes in reach-to-grasp kinematics. These manipulations not only affected gross performance measures (e.g. velocity and amplitude) but also disrupted coordinated execution of reach sub-movements. Once dopamine stimulation-induced changes were established, reach-to-grasp kinematics depended strongly on the dopamine status of the current trial. Furthermore, these effects were temporally specific – only manipulations during reaches influenced forelimb kinematics. Finally, the effect of dopamine on motor control is context-dependent, as the same dopamine stimulation in the cylinder and reaching chamber induced distinct behavioral responses.</p><p>The history-dependent effects of dopamine on skilled reaching are superficially consistent with reinforcement learning models (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib64">Schultz, 2019</xref>). While most evidence for phasic dopamine signals encoding RPEs comes from paradigms in which animals choose between discrete actions (e.g. press a right or left lever), recent studies suggest that dopamine encodes RPE-like ‘performance prediction errors’ for complex behaviors with greater degrees of freedom (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Beeler et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Gadagkar et al., 2016</xref>). It is plausible that dopamine neuron excitation/inhibition creates an artificially reinforcing/discouraging signal that influences subsequent reaches. At baseline and in EYFP controls, failed reaches were slightly (but not significantly) shorter than successful reaches (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6s7">Figure 6—figure supplement 7</xref>). Dopamine neuron stimulation could have gradually reinforced this subtle difference until it became measurable. On the other hand, we stimulated or inhibited dopamine neurons on every trial, so that ‘short reach’ and ‘long reach’ reinforcement should cancel each other. Furthermore, stimulation and inhibition had consistent, almost opposite effects. Since there are many possible failure mechanisms, we would expect variable and unpredictable kinematic changes if dopamine neuron stimulation was artificially reinforcing failed reaches. Together, these findings suggest that kinematic changes do not result purely from performance prediction error signals, but that dopamine intrinsically biases movement kinematics in a consistent direction. Closed loop experiments in which manipulations occur only for ‘long’ or ‘short’ reaches may definitively separate these possibilities (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib75">Yttri and Dudman, 2016</xref>).</p><p>Motion tracking data provide insight into the nature of an intrinsic dopamine bias. A common interpretation of dopamine’s role in movement is that it regulates ‘vigor,’ which has been defined as the speed, frequency, and amplitude of movements (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Dudman and Krakauer, 2016</xref>). Our dopamine manipulations influenced ‘vigor’ in unexpected ways: dopamine neuron stimulation decreased, and inhibition increased, movement amplitude (reach extent). Furthermore, both stimulation and inhibition decreased movement speed. These effects apparently contradict previous work directly correlating dopaminergic tone with movement velocity and/or amplitude (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Carr and White, 1987</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib46">Leventhal et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib53">Panigrahi et al., 2015</xref>).</p><p>This discrepancy may be due to different demands on the motor system. ‘Vigor’ assays generally demand movement along one dimension. For example, mice manipulating a joystick (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib53">Panigrahi et al., 2015</xref>), or humans moving a manipulandum to a target (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Baraduc et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib48">Mazzoni et al., 2007</xref>) make forelimb/arm movements across large joints more or less along a single vector. In such tasks, dopamine-depleted subjects consistently make hypometric, bradykinetic movements. In contrast, skilled reaching comprises a sequence of precisely coordinated submovements (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib41">Klein and Dunnett, 2012</xref>). Stimulation caused paw pronation and digit spread to occur earlier along the reach trajectory (farther from the pellet), while inhibition delayed digit spread. Similarly, humans with PD reshape their hands closer to the target than control subjects (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib58">Rand et al., 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib72">Whishaw et al., 2002</xref>). This is consistent with dopamine regulating initiation of, and transitions between, movements (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">da Silva et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">Hamilos et al., 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">Howe and Dombeck, 2016</xref>). Within a ‘vigor’ framework, dopamine may invigorate the next submovement at the expense of the current one, compressing the overall sequence. In the limiting case, overlapping submovements could manifest as muscle cocontractions and dystonia, a possibility supported by the rare occurrence of abnormal movements intruding into reaches in the most severely affected rats. Simultaneous EMG recordings from multiple muscles could address this possibility (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">Hyland and Jordan, 1997</xref>).</p><p>The mechanisms by which forelimb-digit coordination occurs normally are unclear, let alone under dopamine perturbations (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib44">Leib et al., 2020</xref>). For ballistic movements, it is suggested that internal models predict consequences of motor commands to allow rapid feedback for online corrections (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Azim and Alstermark, 2015</xref>). Such models necessarily integrate sensory feedback (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Azim et al., 2014</xref>) with the passage of time (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Crevecoeur and Gevers, 2019</xref>). Dopamine and striatal circuitry have been implicated in time estimation, though on a slower timescale than skilled reaching (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">Hamilos et al., 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib49">Mello et al., 2015</xref>). Accelerated time perception (i.e. perceiving more time has passed than actually has) should cause premature submovement transitions, although some studies indicate that dopamine alters time perception in the opposite direction (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib67">Soares et al., 2016</xref>). Others suggest that dopamine regulates integration of multiple information streams (including time) for decision making (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">Howard et al., 2017</xref>). It is therefore plausible that dopamine alters reliance on sensory feedback, time perception, the internal model itself, or a combination of these elements.</p><p>Kinematic changes developed gradually, but once established they depended on the dopamine status of the current trial (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig10">Figure 10</xref>). Rats previously stimulated during reaching experienced larger trial-by-trial stimulation-dependent changes in reach kinematics than stimulation-naive rats or rats that had only received ‘between-reach’ stimulation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig10">Figure 10</xref>, <xref ref-type="video" rid="video5">Video 5</xref>). This ‘skilled reaching sensitization’ shares attributes with sensitization to dopaminergic drugs (e.g. amphetamine, cocaine, and levodopa), in which repeated administration renders rodents hypersensitive to subsequent doses (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib59">Robinson and Becker, 1986</xref>). While the mechanisms of sensitization to dopaminergic drugs are not fully understood, enhanced dopaminergic and glutamatergic signaling are implicated (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Cadoni et al., 2000</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib77">Zhang et al., 2001</xref>). Similar mechanisms could mediate skilled reaching sensitization, possibly in dorsal ‘motor’ striatum.</p><p>An important difference between sensitization to drugs and optogenetic stimulation is the specificity of the latter to movements performed during stimulation. Rats that had been stimulated between reaches were initially unaffected by ‘during reach’ stimulation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig10">Figure 10A–C</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig10s1">Figure 10—figure supplements 1</xref>,<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig10s2">2</xref>, <xref ref-type="video" rid="video5">Video 5</xref>), arguing against a general sensitizing effect. Cortico- or thalamo-striatal transmission may be sensitized specifically at synapses active during elevated dopamine signaling (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib76">Yttri and Dudman, 2018</xref>). Consistent with this idea, subpopulations of direct pathway medium spiny neurons are associated with dyskinesias after levodopa treatment in dopamine-depleted mice (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib60">Ryan et al., 2018</xref>), and selective activation of these direct pathway MSNs induces dyskinesias (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Girasole et al., 2018</xref>). These results suggest that subpopulations of striatal output neurons encode specific dopamine-sensitive movements. In our experiments, the specific population of ‘sensitized’ MSNs would be those active during reaching.</p><p>The abrupt transitions between aberrant and baseline reach kinematics are reminiscent of ‘on/off’ motor fluctuations observed in people with PD. With disease progression and prolonged treatment, patients often display sudden transitions between severe bradykinesia, good motor control, and levodopa-induced dyskinesias (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Chou et al., 2018</xref>). Disease duration, degree of dopamine loss, and magnitude of treatment-related dopamine fluctuations are correlated (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Abercrombie et al., 1990</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">de la Fuente-Fernández et al., 2004</xref>). The root causes of motor fluctuations are therefore difficult to identify, though it is suggested that ‘on-offs’ in PD may share mechanisms with drug sensitization (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Calabresi et al., 2008</xref>). Our results indicate that large, temporally specific dopamine fluctuations are sufficient to cause dramatic dopamine-dependent changes in movement kinematics, even in otherwise healthy subjects. This suggests that large swings in striatal dopamine are sufficient to generate motor fluctuations, independent of the degree of dopamine denervation.</p><p>The motor effects of dopamine neuron stimulation also depended on behavioral context. Dopamine neuron stimulation had almost no effect on stimulation-naive rats in a clear cylinder. Rats engaged in skilled reaching during dopamine neuron stimulation continued to engage in the task, with few abnormal involuntary movements during reaching (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig11">Figure 11</xref>). However, the same stimulation parameters delivered to previously-stimulated rats in clear cylinders induced markedly abnormal limb and body movements (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig11">Figure 11</xref> and <xref ref-type="video" rid="video6">Video 6</xref>). Thus, skilled reaching sensitization may have generalized to the cylinder. However, it is unclear if enhanced AIMs required stimulation in the reaching chamber, or if stimulation during the initial AIMs test was sufficient (a single amphetamine dose can induce sensitization given a sufficiently long drug hiatus, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib69">Valjent et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib70">Vanderschuren et al., 1999</xref>). In either case, this is consistent with the idea that dopamine regulates the ‘vigor’ of movements selected based on the current behavioral context (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib75">Yttri and Dudman, 2016</xref>). That is, in the reaching chamber, rats approach the reaching slot to perform a (dopamine-modified) reach because that is the appropriate action in that context. Conversely, with no specific goal-directed actions suggested by the cylinder context, dopamine equally invigorates many potential movements. This leads to seemingly random abnormal involuntary movements (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Bastide et al., 2015</xref>). Interestingly, the severity of experimental levodopa-induced dyskinesias depends on behavioral context (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib42">Lane et al., 2011</xref>). This context dependence of dopaminergic effects on motor control has parallels in clinical phenomenology: people with PD often can perform goal-directed movements despite the presence of significant levodopa-induced dyskinesias.</p><p>There are several limitations of this study. First, we did not record from dopamine neurons or measure dopamine release during optogenetic manipulations. It is therefore not clear how striatal dopamine levels were altered relative to normal reach-related dopamine dynamics, or if repeated stimulation changed spontaneous or optically evoked dopamine release (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib62">Saunders et al., 2018</xref>). Given the relatively high optical stimulation power (20 mW at the fiber tip) and frequency (20 Hz) used, we suspect that we induced supraphysiologic dopamine release (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib55">Patriarchi et al., 2018</xref>, but see <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Hamid et al., 2016</xref>). Nonetheless, supra/infraphysiologic manipulations (e.g. lesion studies) can provide important insights into normal function. Furthermore, supraphysiologic dopamine fluctuations are relevant to pathologic states like PD, in which striatal dopamine can transition over minutes to hours between very low and high levels (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Abercrombie et al., 1990</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">de la Fuente-Fernández et al., 2004</xref>). Second, we stimulated over SNc. It is therefore unclear how ventral tegmental area (VTA) stimulation would influence skilled reaching, and whether stimulating specific nigral projection fields (e.g. striatal subregions or motor cortex, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Guo et al., 2015</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Hosp et al., 2011</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib78">Zhang et al., 2017</xref>) would differentially affect reach kinematics. Finally, while we found that dopamine neuron manipulations during, but not between, reaches affected reach kinematics, the timing of when dopamine manipulations exert their effects could be parsed more precisely. Our ‘during reach’ timing covered approach to the pellet, the reach itself, and immediately after the grasp during pellet consumption. ‘Phasic’ dopamine release at the time of an unpredicted reward is believed to be responsible for reinforcing actions of dopamine, while ‘tonic’ dopamine levels are suggested to regulate motivation/vigor (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib51">Niv et al., 2007</xref>). Activation of different terminal fields at different times with respect to behavior, as well as continuous monitoring of dopamine release (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib55">Patriarchi et al., 2018</xref>), may identify distinct roles for tonic and phasic dopamine in dexterous skill.</p><p>In summary, temporally specific dopamine signals cause gradual changes in dexterous skill performance separable from pure ‘vigor’ effects. These changes are durable, and expressed in a dopamine-dependent manner on a reach-by-reach basis. This phenomenon has clinical analogy with rapid motor fluctuations in PD patients. It may, therefore, serve as a useful paradigm in which to study the underlying neurobiology of motor fluctuations in PD, as well as address fundamental questions regarding how dopamine and basal ganglia circuits regulate skilled movements.</p></sec><sec id="s4" sec-type="materials|methods"><title>Materials and methods</title><table-wrap id="keyresource" position="anchor"><label>Key resources table</label><table frame="hsides" rules="groups"><thead><tr><th>Reagent type <break/>(species) or resource</th><th>Designation</th><th>Source or reference</th><th>Identifiers</th><th>Additional information</th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td>Strain, <break/>strain background <break/>(<italic>TH-Cre Long-Evans rats, male and female</italic>)</td><td>LE-Tg(TH-Cre)3.1Deis</td><td>Rat Resource and Research Center</td><td>RRRC#: 00659; <break/>RRID:<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://scicrunch.org/resolver/RGD_10401201">RGD_10401201</ext-link></td><td/></tr><tr><td>Antibody</td><td>anti-GFP <break/>(Mouse monoclonal)</td><td>Millipore Sigma</td><td>Cat. #: MAB3580; <break/>RRID:<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://scicrunch.org/resolver/AB_94936">AB_94936</ext-link></td><td>(1:1500)</td></tr><tr><td>Antibody</td><td>anti-TH <break/>(Rabbit polyclonal)</td><td>Millipore Sigma</td><td>Cat. #: AB152; <break/>RRID:<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://scicrunch.org/resolver/AB_390204">AB_390204</ext-link></td><td>(1:2000)</td></tr><tr><td>Antibody</td><td>Alexa Fluor 488 <break/>donkey anti-mouse IgG <break/>(Donkey polyclonal)</td><td>Thermo Fisher</td><td>Cat. #: A-21202; <break/>RRID:<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://scicrunch.org/resolver/AB_141607">AB_141607</ext-link></td><td>(1:500)</td></tr><tr><td>Antibody</td><td>Alexa Fluor 555 donkey <break/>anti-rabbit IgG <break/>(Donkey polyclonal)</td><td>Thermo Fisher</td><td>Cat. #: A-31572; <break/>RRID:<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://scicrunch.org/resolver/AB_162543">AB_162543</ext-link></td><td>(1:500)</td></tr><tr><td>Recombinant DNA reagent</td><td>AAV5-EF1α-DIO-hChR2 <break/>(H134R)-EFYP</td><td>UNC Vector Core</td><td/><td/></tr><tr><td>Recombinant DNA reagent</td><td>AAV5-EF1α-DIO-eArch3.0-EYFP</td><td>UNC Vector Core</td><td/><td/></tr><tr><td>Recombinant DNA reagent</td><td>AAV-EF1α-DIO-EYFP</td><td>UNC Vector Core</td><td/><td/></tr><tr><td>Software, algorithm</td><td>Matlab</td><td>Mathworks</td><td>RRID:<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://scicrunch.org/resolver/SCR_001622">SCR_001622</ext-link></td><td/></tr><tr><td>Software, algorithm</td><td>RStudio</td><td>RStudio PBC</td><td>RRID:<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://scicrunch.org/resolver/SCR_000432">SCR_000432</ext-link></td><td/></tr><tr><td>Other</td><td>ProLong Diamond</td><td>Invitrogen</td><td>Cat. #: P36961</td><td/></tr></tbody></table></table-wrap><sec id="s4-1"><title>Rats</title><p>All animal procedures were approved by the University of Michigan Institutional Animal Care and Use Committee.

A second camcorder was placed above the reaching chamber to record the entire session at 60 frames-per-second (HC-V110, Panasonic).</p></sec><sec id="s4-3-2"><title>Trial performance</title><p>Custom LabVIEW software controls the experiment (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Bova et al., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Ellens et al., 2016</xref>). Each training session begins with the pellet delivery rod in the ‘ready’ position - halfway between the bottom of the reaching chamber and the reaching slot. When the rat breaks the IR beam at the back of the chamber, the pellet delivery rod rises to the bottom of the reaching slot. When the reaching paw passes the front plane of the chamber into the ‘region of interest’ and surpasses the minimum threshold of pixel intensity, video acquisition is triggered, time-stamped, and labeled with the trial number. Two seconds after the video is triggered, the pellet delivery arm lowers into the pellet funnel to pick up a new pellet and then resets to the ‘ready’ position, allowing the rat to initiate a new trial.</p></sec><sec id="s4-3-3"><title>Pre-training</title><p>‘Pre-training’ consists of familiarizing the rats with the reaching chamber, evaluating them for paw-preference, training them to reach for the linear actuator, and training them to request a pellet by moving to the back of the chamber. A week before pre-training, rats were placed on food restriction and introduced to the sucrose reward pellets in their home cages. On day 1 of pre-training, piles of five pellets each were placed in the front and rear of the skilled reaching chamber to encourage exploration of the entire chamber. Once rats ate these pellets, they were evaluated for paw-preference.</p><p>Rats were allowed to eat three pellets (held in forceps through the reaching slot) with their tongues. The experimenter then began to pull the pellet away from the rat so that it could not be obtained by licking. Therefore, the rat was forced to reach with its paw to retrieve the pellet. Paw preference was assigned to the paw used for the majority of the first eleven reaches. Once paw preference was determined, animals were trained to reach for the pellet delivery rod. As the rat reached, the experimenter pulled the forceps back so that the rat’s paw would extend to a pellet on the delivery rod. Once rats reached for the delivery rod 10 times without being baited by the experimenter, they began training to request pellets.</p><p>Rats began training in the center of the chamber with the pellet delivery rod set to the ‘ready’ position. The experimenter placed a pellet in the rear of the chamber to bait the rat to break the rear IR beam, causing the delivery rod to rise so that the rat could move to the front and reach for the pellet. This was repeated until the rat began to quickly move to the front of the chamber to reach for the pellet after breaking the IR beam. At this point, the experimenter would stop baiting the rat to the rear of the chamber. Pre-training was complete once the rat requested a pellet and then immediately moved to the front to reach for the pellet 10 times.</p></sec><sec id="s4-3-4"><title>Training</title><p>After pre-training, rats began 30-min training sessions with the automated system. Rats were trained for 6 days per week until they reached stable performance (minimum of 35 reaches and a steady success rate above 40% over three sessions). Once behavioral criteria were met, rats were implanted with optical fibers.</p></sec></sec><sec id="s4-4"><title>Optogenetics</title><p>Before testing with optogenetic interventions, rats were re-trained for 10 days while tethered to the patch cable without light delivery. This allowed rats to return to stable performance after surgery and adapt to the tether. During the 10 days of testing with optogenetic interventions, light was delivered on every trial at one of two different times. For ‘during reach’ stimulation, the laser turned on when the rat broke the IR beam at the back of the chamber and remained on until 3 s after the video trigger event. For ‘between reach’ stimulation, light was delivered beginning 4 s after the video trigger and remained on for 5 s (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1D</xref>). The duration of ‘between reach’ stimulation was approximately matched to the median duration of ‘during reach’ stimulation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1</xref>). The duration of ‘during reach’ stimulation was assessed by custom MATLAB code (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Bova et al., 2020</xref>), which scanned videos recorded from above the reaching chamber frame-by-frame for blue or green laser light, and identified the beginning and ends of ‘laser on’ bouts. An experimenter evaluated the output for accuracy and corrected any errors (e.g. rat’s head went out of frame and one laser bout was incorrectly split into two bouts). For ChR2- and EYFP-injected rats, 473 nm laser light (Opto Engine DPSS laser) was delivered at 20 Hz and an estimated 20 mW at the fiber tip based on pre-implantation measurements using a calibrated photodiode (Thorlabs S121C connected to Thorlabs PM100D Power Meter). The laser was on continuously, with 20 Hz stimulation achieved using an optical chopper (Thorlabs MC1F10HP) to eliminate transient power fluctuations as the laser is turned off and on. For Arch-injected rats, 532 nm laser light (Opto Engine DPSS laser) was delivered continuously at an estimated 20 mW at the fiber tip.</p><p>Following optogenetic testing, rats were tested for another 10 days with the patch cable attached to the implanted fiber and the laser activated. However, the patch cable-implanted fiber junction was physically occluded by inserting a piece of dense foam within the connector that holds the patch cable and optical fiber. Full occlusion of the laser was checked before each session by measuring light output at the fiber tip using a calibrated photodiode (Thorlabs S121C connected to Thorlabs PM100D Power Meter). In this way, all sensory cues were identical (e.g. visible light, optical shutter sounds) but light could not penetrate into the brain. The timing of light delivery was identical to that used during testing with optogenetic interventions.</p><p>Following the last ‘occlusion’ session, ChR2 Between rats (see <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figures 1</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig10">10A</xref>) were tested for an additional 2–8 days with the laser on during reaches, until reaches were impaired. Rats then performed an additional one or two 30-min sessions during which the laser alternated every five trials between being off and on during reaches.</p></sec><sec id="s4-5"><title>Analysis of skilled reaching data</title><p>Analyses were performed using custom-written scripts and functions in MATLAB 2019a (MathWorks, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Bova et al., 2020</xref>).</p></sec><sec id="s4-6"><title>Number of trials and success rate</title><p>Reach outcome was scored by visual inspection as follows: 0 – no pellet presented or other mechanical failure (‘no pellet’); 1 – first trial success (obtained pellet on initial limb advance; ‘first success’); 2 – success (obtained pellet, but not on first attempt; ‘multi try success’); 3 – forelimb advanced, pellet was grasped then dropped in the box (‘drop in box’); 4 – forelimb advance, but the pellet was knocked off the shelf (‘pellet knocked off’); 5 – pellet was obtained using its tongue (‘used tongue’); 6 – the rat approached the slot but retreated without advancing its forelimb or the video triggered without a reach (‘trigger error’); 7 – the rat reached, but the pellet remained on the shelf (‘pellet remained’); 8 – the rat used its ipsilateral (in reference to hemisphere with optical fiber implant) paw to reach (‘ipsilateral paw’); 9 – laser fired at the wrong time (‘laser error’); or 10 – used preferred paw after obtaining or moving pellet with tongue (‘tongue and paw’). An additional outcome evaluated by kinematic analysis was defined as videos which began with the rat’s paw through the slot (i.e. the video triggered late; ‘paw through slot’). Outcome percent was calculated by dividing the number of trials of each outcome by the total number of trials per session. For comparisons of kinematics between successful and failed reaches, successes were defined as ‘first success’ (1) and failed reaches were defined as ‘pellet knocked off’ (4) or ‘pellet remained’ (7).</p><p>First reach success was calculated for each session by dividing the total number of scores of 1 by the total number of trials (sum of scores of 1, 2, 3, 4, and 7). ‘Any reach’ success rate was calculated by dividing the sum of scores 1 and 2 by the total number of trials. For both number of trials per session and first reach success rate, a baseline score was calculated for each rat by averaging the scores of the last two retraining sessions (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2A,D</xref>). Number of trials and success rates for each session within ‘laser on’ and ‘occlusion’ sessions were normalized by dividing the score for that session by the averaged baseline score (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figures 2B–C, E–F</xref>,<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">3A–B</xref>,<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">4A–D</xref>).</p><p>To assess how success rate changed within individual sessions, a moving average was calculated as the fraction of ‘1’ scores in a moving block of 10 reaches. For averages within a group, the last data point for each individual was carried forward to the maximum number of reaches for any rat in that session. This avoided sudden changes in the average caused by dropout (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2G</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s1">Figure 2—figure supplement 1</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3C</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s1">Figure 3—figure supplement 1</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4E</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s1">Figure 4—figure supplements 1</xref>–<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s2">2</xref>).</p></sec><sec id="s4-7"><title>Three-dimensional reconstruction of reach trajectories</title><p>Bodyparts/objects identified in the direct and mirror views were triangulated to three-dimensional points using custom MATLAB software (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Bova et al., 2019</xref>). Prior to each session, several images of a cube with checkerboards (4 × 4 mm squares) on its sides were taken so that the checkerboards were visible in the direct and mirror views. These images were used to determine the essential matrix relating the direct and mirror views, which was used to determine how the real camera and ‘virtual’ camera behind the mirror were translated and rotated with respect to each other (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">Hartley and Zisserman, 2003</xref>). By assuming a three-dimensional coordinate system centered at the camera lens with the z-axis perpendicular to the lens surface, camera matrices were derived for the real and virtual cameras. These matrices were used to triangulate matching points in the camera and mirror views using the MATLAB triangulate function in the Computer Vision toolbox. Three-dimensional points with large reprojection errors were excluded from the analysis, which could happen if an object was identified accurately in one view but misidentified in the other. The coordinate system was set with the pellet at the origin, positive x to the right of the pellet, positive y below the pellet, and positive z on the other side of the pellet from the reaching chamber (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5</xref>).</p></sec><sec id="s4-8"><title>Processing reach kinematics</title><p>To place reach kinematics in a common reference frame, the pellet location prior to reaching was identified and set as the origin. For left-pawed reaches, x-coordinates were negated to allow direct comparison with right-pawed reaches. The initial reach on each trial was identified by finding the first frame in which digits were visible outside the box, and then looking backwards in time until the paw started moving forward. The end of a reach was defined as the frame at which the tip of the second digit began to retract (‘maximum reach extent’, z<sub>digit2</sub>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5</xref>); multiple reaches could be counted in a single trial. ‘Aperture’ was calculated as the Euclidean distance between the tips of the 1st and 4th digits (in frames for which both were visible or could be estimated based on epipolar geometry). ‘Orientation’ was calculated as the angle between a line connecting the 1st and 4th digits and a horizontal line (for left-pawed rats, orientation was calculated using the negated x-values to compare with right-pawed rats). Paw velocity was calculated as the Euclidean distance between the dorsum of the reaching paw in consecutive frames divided by the inter-frame interval (1/300 s).</p><p>To separate the influences of changes in paw transport from changes in grasp kinematics on reaching proficiency, we examined success rates across experimental groups in trials matched for reach extent (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6s8">Figure 6—figure supplement 8</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7s8">Figure 7—figure supplement 8</xref>). We stratified trials by their maximum z<sub>digit2</sub> extent in 1-mm-wide bins beginning at z<sub>digit2</sub> = 0, and compared reach success, digit aperture, and paw orientation within each stratum.</p></sec><sec id="s4-9"><title>Within-session kinematics</title><p>To assess how reach kinematics (i.e. maximum reach extent, aperture, paw orientation, and maximum reach velocity) changed within individual sessions, a moving average was calculated by averaging kinematic data across a moving block of 10 trials. For averages within an experimental group, the last data point was carried forward to the end of the data set. This avoided sudden changes in the average caused by rats performing different numbers of trials within a session.</p></sec><sec id="s4-10"><title>Analysis of reach-to-grasp coordination</title><p>To monitor aperture and paw orientation as a function of the z-coordinate of the tip of the second digit (z<sub>digit2</sub>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8">Figures 8</xref>,<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig9">9</xref> and all <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig9s1">Figure 9—figure supplements 1</xref>–<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig9s5">5</xref>), the first reach of each trial was isolated. The three-dimensional trajectory of each digit tip for the initial reach was interpolated using piecewise cubic Hermite polynomials (<italic>pchip</italic> in MATLAB) so that the three-dimensional location of each digit was estimated for z<sub>digit2</sub> = −20.0,–19.9, −19.8… +14.9, +15.0 mm from the pellet (positive numbers are past the pellet, negative numbers as the paw approaches the pellet). This allows us to average aperture and orientation as a function of paw advancement (assessed by z<sub>digit2</sub>). Points at z<sub>digit2</sub> values missing from shorter reaches were excluded from the average. Note that trajectories in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig9">Figure 9</xref> could extend past the average z<sub>digit2</sub> endpoints in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6A</xref> because of longer-than-average trajectories.</p><p>Two rats from the ‘ChR2 During’ group were excluded from the averaged aperture and paw orientation as a function of z<sub>digit2</sub> (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig9">Figure 9B,E</xref>). The majority of these rats’ reaches during ‘laser sessions’ were so short that there were not enough trials with full trajectories to produce a meaningful average (see <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig9s1">Figure 9—figure supplements 1</xref>,<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig9s2">2</xref> for analysis with all six rats).</p><p>To compare the evolution of aperture and paw orientation between retraining, laser, and occlusion sessions, we compared digit aperture and paw orientation at specific z<sub>digit2</sub> values. For all groups except ‘ChR2 During’ and ‘ChR2 Between’, we evaluated aperture and orientation at z<sub>digit2</sub> = 1 mm past the pellet (z<sub>digit2</sub> = +1 mm). Because rats frequently did not reach past the pellet when dopamine neurons were activated ‘during reach’, we analyzed aperture and paw orientation at z<sub>digit2</sub> = 7 mm before the pellet (z<sub>digit2 </sub>= −7 mm) for this group.</p></sec><sec id="s4-11"><title>Abnormal involuntary movements (AIMs) testing</title><p>Rats underwent AIMs testing twice – one day before the first day of retraining and one day after the last day of occlusion sessions. One rat from the ‘ChR2 During’ group and one rat from the ‘ChR2 Between’ group were only tested after occlusion sessions, and therefore were not included in the analysis. Rats were attached to the patch cable and placed into a clear plexiglass cylinder (diameter = 21 cm). Two mirrors were placed behind the chamber so that the animal was visible in all positions in recordings. Once in the cylinder, animals underwent a series of 30 s stimulation epochs alternating with 30 s rest periods. Sessions always began with a rest period (baseline), and the order of laser power (estimated 5, 10, 15, 20, 25 mW at fiber tip) was randomly generated in Matlab. Stimulation was applied at 20 Hz at a 50% duty cycle. Stimulation sessions were video recorded at 60 frames-per-second (HC-V110, Panasonic).</p><p>AIMs videos were segmented into individual videos for each stimulation bout and assigned random codes so that scorers were blinded to the rat’s virus (ChR2 or EYFP), laser power, and day of testing. Axial and limb AIMs were scored for both severity (amplitude scale) and duration (basic scale) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib65">Sebastianutto et al., 2016</xref>). The amplitude and basic scores were multiplied to create a composite score for axial and limb AIMs. Global AIMs scores were the sum of the axial and limb composite scores. Rotational behavior was also analyzed by counting the number of full 360 degree rotations in the contralateral and ipsilateral directions during each 30 s video. Ipsilateral turns were subtracted from contralateral turns to identify a rotational bias.</p><p>To assess if AIMs were present during reaches, ten trials in which the rat failed to obtain the pellet (‘pellet knocked off’ or ‘pellet remained’ outcomes) were randomly selected for each rat from ‘laser on’ sessions 2 and 10 and ‘occlusion’ session 10 for ‘ChR2 ‘during rats. Ten trials were also randomly selected for each EYFP rat from ‘laser on’ session 10. However, two EYFP rats only had 1 and 3 trials from ‘laser on’ session 10 with failed outcomes. Therefore, additional trials from ‘laser on’ sessions 9 (both rats) and 8 (one rat) were selected for these two rats. Once all videos were selected, they were assigned random codes so the scorer was blind to the group (ChR2 during vs EYFP) and session. Axial and limb AIMs during reaching movements were evaluated for severity (amplitude scale – see above). Global AIMs scores were calculated as the sum of the axial and limb amplitude scores for each rat.</p></sec><sec id="s4-12"><title>Immunohistochemistry</title><p>Rats were deeply anesthetized with isoflurane (5%) and transcardially perfused with cold saline followed by 4% paraformaldehyde. Brains were post-fixed for no more than 24 hr at 4°C, rinsed with saline, and moved through 20% and 30% sucrose solutions (in PBS) at 4°C. Sagittal sections (30 μm thickness) were taken around SNc and where the optical fiber was visible on a cryostat (Leica Microsystems). To verify localization of viral expression in dopamine neurons and optical fiber placement above SNc, we performed immunohistochemistry for TH and EYFP. Mounted sections were washed with PBS and incubated with Triton X-100 and PBS (PBS-Tx) for 15 min. Slides were then incubated in 5% normal donkey serum (NDS) for 1 hr before primary antibody incubation (mouse anti-GFP, 1:1500, Life Technologies; rabbit anti-TH, 1:2000, Millipore) overnight at room temperature with NDS and PBS-Tx. Sections were then washed with PBS-Tx and incubated with secondary antibodies (Alexa Fluor 488 donkey anti-mouse, 1:500, Life Technologies; Alexa Fluor 555 donkey anti-rabbit, 1:500, Fisher Scientific) for 2 hr at room temperature. After washing four times with PBS, sections were coverslipped with ProLong Diamond (Invitrogen), allowed to dry for 24 hr, and then imaged with an Axioskops 2 Plus microscope fitted with an Olympus DP72 camera.</p><p>Images were stitched together and TH- and EYFP-stained images were overlaid in Photoshop to verify localization of viral expression to dopamine neurons. Images were evaluated by two people blinded to the behavioral outcomes of the individual rats on (1) sufficient virus expression in SNc and striatal dopamine neurons and (2) location of fiber tip over SNc. Data from rats whose histology was evaluated as not meeting both of these criteria by both evaluators were removed from the analysis (n = 8 rats removed, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1</xref>).

Your article has been reviewed by three peer reviewers, including Aryn H Gittis as the Reviewing Editor and Reviewer #1, and the evaluation has been overseen by Kate Wassum as the Senior Editor.</p><p>The reviewers have discussed the reviews with one another and the Reviewing Editor has drafted this decision to help you prepare a revised submission.</p><p>As the editors have judged that your manuscript is of interest, but as described below that revisions are required before it is published, we would like to draw your attention to changes in our revision policy that we have made in response to COVID-19 (https://elifesciences.org/articles/57162). First, because many researchers have temporarily lost access to the labs, we will give authors as much time as they need to submit revised manuscripts. We are also offering, if you choose, to post the manuscript to bioRxiv (if it is not already there) along with this decision letter and a formal designation that the manuscript is &quot;in revision at <italic>eLife</italic>&quot;. Please let us know if you would like to pursue this option. (If your work is more suitable for medRxiv, you will need to post the preprint yourself, as the mechanisms for us to do so are still in development.)</p><p>Summary:</p><p>The study by Bova and colleagues describe how midbrain dopamine neurons affect skillful control of forearm movements in a reach-to-grasp pellet task. The study provides much needed data on how dopamine manipulations affect skilled, dexterous movements, as well as the valuable observation of a history dependence to dopamine stimulation effects, which could be important for interpreting past and future dopamine stimulation results in the literature. A particularly intriguing aspect of this study was the observation that SNc dopamine stimulation during reaching gradually shifts kinematics, but re-introducing the stimulation immediately recalls similar impaired movement changes even after the kinematics returned to baseline measurements (laser occluded). Overall, this is an exciting study that highlights how dopamine signaling influences immediate and long-term motor execution in a behavioral paradigm that quantifies complex movements. However, a number of concerns were raised during the review that should be addressed:</p><p>Essential revisions:</p><p>1) Behavioral quantification during the task:</p><p>a) How do reach kinematics differ between successful vs. failed reach attempts? Are the trajectories and coordination sequence for the failed trials (in EYFP rats) completely different from the aberrant movements observed with stimulation? Since the first reach success rate is around 50-60%, the stimulation might be reinforcing failed reaches on subsequent trials somehow.</p><p>b) It seems a bit arbitrary to focus on first reach success. Kinematic analysis should be shown with accuracy and rate. Do peak velocities and the trajectories change as the success rate drops? This could provide a more complete view of how stimulation is changing this complex behavior, i.e. transport phase, grasp, etc. The authors note that accuracy has a floor effect and could change for a multitude of reasons.</p><p>c) The methods allude to a trial-scoring system to address behavior heterogeneity but this data is not shown anywhere in the paper. How much heterogeneity was there, especially, how often did trial types 5-8 occur? Is the distribution affected by stimulation? Do rats begin to try other strategies than contralateral reaching as the stimulation sessions go on? And if ipsilateral reaches (trial type 8) happen with any frequency, are they affected by stimulation?</p><p>d) A concern was raised that undetected AIMs during the reach task might contribute to failed grasps. The authors state that there are few involuntary movements during reaches, but it was not clear what analyses were used to test for AIMs during the reach task.</p><p>2) Validation of optogenetic manipulations:</p><p>a) In Figure 1—figure supplement 2, viral expression looks fairly uniform but fiber placement in M-L and A-P dimensions is variable. This is problematic if there is a systemic difference between groups. This worry could be addressed by testing for significance in M-L and A-P placement between groups and summarizing those data in Figure 1—figure supplement 1. Is fiber placement related to stim efficacy within groups? The authors could test for correlation between M-L or A-P placement and stim effect for the &quot;ChR2-during&quot; and &quot;Arch-during&quot; groups.</p><p>b) One reviewer was concerned about the lack of measurements of increases or decreases in DA levels in the striatum during optogenetic manipulations. Ultimately, a discussion amongst the reviewers determined that due to precedence in the literature, such validation is not explicitly needed here.

Are the trajectories and coordination sequence for the failed trials (in EYFP rats) completely different from the aberrant movements observed with stimulation? Since the first reach success rate is around 50-60%, the stimulation might be reinforcing failed reaches on subsequent trials somehow.</p></disp-quote><p>This is an interesting point, and in fact how we initially interpreted the data. After careful review, however, we decided that a pure “reinforcement” model cannot account for all of our observations. The reviewer’s comments prompted new analyses that helped clarify our thoughts.</p><p>We analyzed reach kinematics separately for successful and failed reaches. These new analyses are shown in Figure 6—figure supplement 7, Figure 7—figure supplement 7, and Figure 9—figure supplements 2 and 3. At baseline and in EYFP controls (also in Arch During and Between groups), there was a subtle, nonsignificant difference in reach extent between successful and failed reaches. Failed reaches tended to be slightly shorter, supporting the reviewer’s hypothesis that dopamine neuron stimulation might gradually reinforce “bad” kinematics.</p><p>While this analysis lends some support to a “reinforcement” model, we feel that it is more likely that dopamine has an intrinsic kinematic bias (though the two possibilities are not mutually exclusive). First, while there was a consistent small difference between successful and failed reaches, it did not reach significance in any analysis (other than “ChR2 during”, “laser on” sessions). We are therefore hesitant to build a model around this finding. More importantly, other observations are inconsistent with the reinforcement model. We stimulated/inhibited dopamine neurons on every trial. Thus, both long and short reaches should have been reinforced, effectively cancelling each other out. Furthermore, dopamine neuron inhibition caused reaches to extend further. By suppressing dopamine neuron activation on successful reaches, we would expect reaches to progressively shorten (presumably dopamine release would already be suppressed during failed short reaches). To definitively determine whether these effects are driven primarily by a reinforcement effect or an intrinsic kinematic bias, closed-loop experiments in which dopamine neurons are manipulated on only “short” or “long” reaches would be required. Recent advances like DeepLabCut-Live! for real-time motion tracking may make this possible.</p><p>We added text addressing these comments in the Discussion, beginning with “At baseline and in EYFP controls, failed reaches were slightly (but not significantly) shorter than successful reaches…”</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>b) It seems a bit arbitrary to focus on first reach success. Kinematic analysis should be shown with accuracy and rate. Do peak velocities and the trajectories change as the success rate drops? This could provide a more complete view of how stimulation is changing this complex behavior, i.e. transport phase, grasp, etc. The authors note that accuracy has a floor effect and could change for a multitude of reasons.</p></disp-quote><p>We appreciate the reviewer’s clarifications of this comment, which we address individually below:</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>1) Show overall accuracy for all attempts, not just first reach. For all conditions.</p></disp-quote><p>The requested plots have been added as supplements for Figures 2, 3, and 4. Overall, “any reach” success is higher than “first reach” success, but follows the same pattern.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>2) How many attempts were present for each of the conditions?</p></disp-quote><p>These plots are included in the same supplements for Figures 2-4. Other than increased attempts in the “During Reach” ChR2 stimulation sessions, rats mostly made one attempt per trial.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>3) Examine if reach amplitude explains the drop in accuracy. What is the accuracy for trials that appear to have normal reach transport? This comparison can be done for all.</p><p>4. Are observed changes in grasp linked to reaching deficits. Are they compensatory for reaching deficits? Examine reaches that appear to be normal (if there) to see if grasp deficits are still there.</p></disp-quote><p>We grouped these together because they are addressed by the same new supplemental figures (Figure 6—figure supplement 8 and Figure 7—figure supplement 8). This is an interesting way of looking at the data that we had not considered, and thank the reviewer for suggesting it.</p><p>First, we excluded reaches where the digit did not extend to the pellet (i.e., z<sub>digit2</sub> &lt; 0). Then, we examined reaches of different extent in 1 mm bins past the pellet. Interestingly, for intermediate reach extension (i.e., ~1-7 mm past the pellet), “ChR2 during” rats were less successful in the “laser on” compared to the “occlusion” condition. As the reviewer suggested, we interpret this to mean that some factor (perhaps coordination of pronation/digit extension) influences success in addition to the change in reach extent/transport.</p><p>Nonetheless, there is still a large difference in reach extent between successful and failed reaches in the ChR2 during group (Figure 6—figure supplement 7). Changes in reach extent therefore also strongly contribute to the change in success rate.</p><p>Regarding the second question, there was a significant difference in paw orientation for extent-matched reaches between laser on and occlusion sessions for ChR2 during rats. This may explain some of the change in success rate at intermediate reach extents. We did not see any significant differences in aperture for extent-matched reaches.</p><p>We added sentences under “Dopamine manipulations induce progressive changes in reach-to-grasp kinematics” in the Results section to describe these findings: “The decrease in reach extent accounted for much of the drop in success rate (Figure 6—figure supplement 7), though reaches matched for reach extent were still less successful during “laser on” than “occlusion” sessions (Figure 6—figure supplement 8). This suggests that paw transport and grasp-related factors both contributed to reach-to-grasp failures.”</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>c) The methods allude to a trial-scoring system to address behavior heterogeneity but this data is not shown anywhere in the paper. How much heterogeneity was there, especially, how often did trial types 5-8 occur? Is the distribution affected by stimulation? Do rats begin to try other strategies than contralateral reaching as the stimulation sessions go on? And if ipsilateral reaches (trial type 8) happen with any frequency, are they affected by stimulation?</p></disp-quote><p>Figure 2—figure supplement 2, Figure 3—figure supplement 2, and Figure 4—figure supplement 3 show the requested data. The main differences that we saw with “during reach” stimulation were that the pellet was knocked off or remained on the pedestal more frequently. Although ipsilateral reaches were rare in the “ChR2 during” group in “laser on” sessions (only 2 of 6 rats had any ipsilateral reaches – 6 in one rat and 1 in the other rat), this achieved statistical significance because ipsilateral reaches almost never happened in “retraining” or “occlusion” sessions (2 of 6 rats in “occlusion” sessions – 1 trial each). There were also a couple of other significant effects – for example, there were a few more trials where no pellet was grabbed by the delivery arm in the “ChR2 between” group during “laser on” sessions. We agree that it would be interesting to see if stimulation also influences ipsilateral forelimb dexterity.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>d) A concern was raised that undetected AIMs during the reach task might contribute to failed grasps. The authors state that there are few involuntary movements during reaches, but it was not clear what analyses were used to test for AIMs during the reach task.</p></disp-quote><p>We performed two additional analyses to address this question. First, to directly quantify the presence/absence of AIMs during reaches, we randomly sampled 10 reaches from “laser on” day 2, “laser on” day 10, and “occlusion” day 10 from each “ChR2 during” rat. We also randomly sampled 10 reaches from each “laser on” day 10 session in the EYFP group. These videos were scored by an investigator blinded to the session identity, rat identity, and experimental group (Ms. Hunter, who has been added as an author). Details of the scoring system have been added to the Materials and methods (paragraph beginning “To assess if AIMs were present during reaches…”), and are based on the system for scoring AIMs in the clear cylinder. These data are shown in the new Figure 11, panel A. Quantifying AIMs during reaches is difficult because the limb is already moving; discerning a superimposed abnormal movement is somewhat subjective. Nonetheless, the vast majority of reaches appeared truncated without superimposed adventitious movements. 3 rats accounted for all of the AIMs – 2 rats with one AIM each, and one rat with 5 (again, out of 10 sampled at random). Furthermore, superimposed AIMs were never observed in the early “laser on” sessions when success rate was already significantly decreased.</p><p>We also looked at whether the dyskinesia scores for individual rats predicted success rates during stimulation (Figure 11—figure supplement 1). In panel A, we looked at “ChR2 During” rats, and plotted the global AIMs score during the second AIMs test (at 20 mW at the fiber tip) against the change in success rate from retraining to “laser on” day 10. Several rats without dyskinesias still had significant drops in success rate, further arguing that dyskinesias are unlikely to account for most of the drop in success rate. In panel B, we looked at “ChR2 Between” rats, and plotted the global AIMs score during the second AIMs test (at 20 mW at the fiber tip) against the change in reach success rate from “occlusion” sessions to the first “laser on during” session. In this case, several rats with significant dyskinesias experienced no change in success rate. Thus, dyskinesias in the cylinder did not necessarily generalize to the reaching context.</p><p>Collectively these data suggest that dyskinesias may account for some reach failures in severely affected rats, but this is not a major failure mechanism. Examples of what we considered abnormal reach kinematics with and without superimposed dyskinesias are shown in Video 7.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>2) Validation of optogenetic manipulations:</p><p>a) In Figure 1—figure supplement 2, viral expression looks fairly uniform but fiber placement in M-L and A-P dimensions is variable. This is problematic if there is a systemic difference between groups. This worry could be addressed by testing for significance in M-L and A-P placement between groups and summarizing those data in Figure 1—figure supplement 1. Is fiber placement related to stim efficacy within groups? The authors could test for correlation between M-L or A-P placement and stim effect for the &quot;ChR2-during&quot; and &quot;Arch-during&quot; groups.</p></disp-quote><p>We added panels C and D to Figure 1—figure supplement 2 showing the distribution of optical fiber locations for each group along the A-P, M-L, and D-V axes. There were no significant differences across groups, and the locations largely overlapped. Therefore, fiber location is very unlikely to account for differences in outcome between groups. Furthermore, “during reach” stimulation following “between reach” stimulation verified that fibers were in the correct location to cause behavioral effects (Figure 10A-C and Figure 10—figure supplements 1 and 2).</p><p>To assess a possible relationship between fiber tip location and the magnitude of kinematic changes, we plotted reach extent (maximum <italic>z<sub>digit2</sub></italic>) as a function of fiber tip coordinates along the A-P, M-L, and D-V axes for each group (the new Figure 6—figure supplement 1 and Figure 7—figure supplement 1). There was a suggestion that more posteromedially located fibers had stronger effects, suggesting that some of these effects could be mediated by activation of lateral VTA in addition to SNc. However, this effect was largely driven by one rat (the diamond in Figure 6—figure supplement 1 “ChR2 during” plots). We added a line under Dopamine manipulations induce progressive changes in reach-to-grasp kinematics describing this result: “This effect may have been stronger for posteromedially located fibers (Figure 6—figure supplement 1).”</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>b) One reviewer was concerned about the lack of measurements of increases or decreases in DA levels in the striatum during optogenetic manipulations. Ultimately, a discussion amongst the reviewers determined that due to precedence in the literature, such validation is not explicitly needed here. If the authors have any data to indicate the magnitude or duration of DA increases or decreases induced by optogenetic manipulations, or firing rate modulation of the TH neurons themselves, this would greatly strengthen the paper. However, the reviewers agreed that if such data could not be provided, it would not preclude publication of the study.</p></disp-quote><p>We do not have these data, but appreciate their relevance. This is a goal of ongoing work.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>3) Methodological and statistical clarification.</p><p>a) Figure 7D: it is puzzling that while there is no overlap in the error bars, no significance is found, but for H, significance is occasionally found (likely a multiple comparisons effect). A correction for multiple comparisons seems necessary.</p></disp-quote><p>The significance was marked in Figure 7I incorrectly (the significance threshold was incorrectly set to p &lt; 0.05 instead of p &lt; 0.01 as for panels E and G). This error has been corrected and all significance bars for within session analyses now reflect p &lt; 0.01.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>b) The authors write that during AIMs test 1, rats &quot;appeared unaffected by dopamine neuron stimulation&quot;. This statement calls for a test of significance difference between AIMs scores in CHR2 test 1 and EYFP test 1.The data appear to be different, but there are no stats. If they are different, this would undercut the author's statement that reaches are unaffected by DA stimulation.</p></disp-quote><p>We performed post hoc contrast tests to directly compare ChR2 test 1 and EYFP test 1 at every power. There were no significant differences on test day 1 between ChR2 and EYFP rats at any power for global, limb, or axial AIMs.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>c). H was the LME model fit (ie in Figure 2, 3, 4, 6)? Was it between all baseline points and all points in the stimulation/control period per animal?</p></disp-quote><p>The LME model was fit using averaged data from “retraining”, “laser on” and “occluded” sessions for each rat in each group. Comparisons were made between “laser on,” “retraining,” and “occluded” sessions.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>4) Interpretation:</p><p>a) The authors interpret the findings in Figures 10 and 11 as reflecting the establishment of &quot;distinct reach-to-grasp representations&quot; and behavioral context dependence. But couldn't they instead reflect a general sensitization to the particular exogenous DA stimulation being used? There has been no distinct representation formed for the AIMs test cylinder, yet on test 2 there are much larger effects on behavior. This doesn't seem the result of a context-dependent, distinct representation as much as an increase in general sensitivity to SNc-DA stimulation. I feel that conclusions about &quot;representations&quot; and &quot;context&quot; should be tempered a bit more.</p></disp-quote><p>We agree with the reviewer that conceptualizing the changes as “sensitized” reaching instead of distinct kinematic representations makes sense, especially since the reaches were qualitatively similar (but compressed or expanded) between stimulated, inhibited, and control rats. In fact, we rewrote the relevant paragraphs (beginning with “Kinematic changes developed gradually, but once established they depended on the dopamine status of the current trial (Figure 10).”) to frame the kinematic changes as a sensitization effect akin to sensitization to drugs of abuse. We believe this is an important idea that provides direction for future studies investigating the mechanism(s) of these effects. We thank the reviewer for this insight.</p><p>However, this sensitization effect is specific based on two key observations. If there were a general sensitization effect, then “during reach” stimulation should immediately cause markedly abnormal reaches after “between reach” stimulation. To test this possibility, we examined these sessions in more detail (new Figures 10A-C and Figure 10—figure supplements 1 and 2). “During reach” stimulation did not immediately cause abnormal reach kinematics in rats that had previously received “between reach” stimulation. Instead, changes in reach kinematics progressed gradually – in fact, they followed a pattern highly similar to initial stimulation in the “During ChR2” group.</p><p>The context-dependence of these effects is illustrated by the comparison between dyskinesias in the cylinder and during reaching. As shown in the new Figure 11A (and Figure 11—figure supplement 1, see response to point 1d), rats had rare limb dyskinesias during reaching in the session immediately preceding the second AIMs test. It is difficult to quantitatively compare AIMs severity during reaching and in the cylinder because the paw is already in motion during reaching. However, compare the severe axial and limb dyskinesias in the cylinder in Video 6 to the limited, relatively mild dyskinesias during reaching in the same rat at the same stimulation amplitude (Videos 6 and 7). In summary, while dyskinesias may occur in either the cylinder or reaching chamber at the same stimulation settings, they were more common and more severe in the cylinder. They are therefore context-dependent.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>b) The fact that SNc-DA inhibition reduces attempted reaches (Figure 4A) is &quot;consistent with a role for midbrain dopamine in motivation to work for rewards,&quot; but then why doesn't stimulation increase attempted reaches?</p></disp-quote><p>There was a non-significant increase in the number of trials performed for both the “during reach” and “between reach” ChR2 groups. However, well-trained rats initiate new trials quickly, even in the absence of stimulation. They are likely already performing a near-maximum number of reaches at baseline. This “ceiling effect” is the most likely explanation for why rats did not perform additional reaches. A sentence was added to note this possibility (“It is not clear why dopamine neuron stimulation did not have the opposite effect…”).</p></body></sub-article></article>
