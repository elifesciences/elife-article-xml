Despite extensive studies, our understanding of this process is hindered by low solubility of phase-separating proteins. One example of this is found in SR and SR-related proteins. These proteins are characterized by domains rich in arginine and serine (RS domains), which are essential to alternative splicing and in vivo phase separation. However, they are also responsible for a low solubility that has made these proteins difficult to study for decades. Here, we solubilize the founding member of the SR family, SRSF1, by introducing a peptide mimicking RS repeats as a co-solute. We find that this RS-mimic peptide forms interactions similar to those of the protein’s RS domain. Both interact with a combination of surface-exposed aromatic residues and acidic residues on SRSF1’s RNA Recognition Motifs (RRMs) through electrostatic and cation-pi interactions. Analysis of RRM domains from human SR proteins indicates that these sites are conserved across the protein family. In addition to opening an avenue to previously unavailable proteins, our work provides insight into how SR proteins phase separate and participate in nuclear speckles.</p></abstract><kwd-group kwd-group-type="author-keywords"><kwd>SRSF1</kwd><kwd>phase separation</kwd><kwd>cation-pi interaction</kwd><kwd>intrinsically disordered protein</kwd><kwd>NMR</kwd><kwd>SR proteins</kwd></kwd-group><kwd-group kwd-group-type="research-organism"><title>Research organism</title><kwd>Human</kwd></kwd-group><funding-group><award-group id="fund1"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000001</institution-id><institution>National Science Foundation</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>MCB2024964</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Zhang</surname><given-names>Jun</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund2"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000002</institution-id><institution>National Institutes of Health</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>R35GM147091</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Zhang</surname><given-names>Jun</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><funding-statement>The funders had no role in study design, data collection and interpretation, or the decision to submit the work for publication.</funding-statement></funding-group><custom-meta-group><custom-meta specific-use="meta-only"><meta-name>Author impact statement</meta-name><meta-value>Short peptides that mimic the regions responsible for phase separation can be used to solubilize phase-separating proteins in their native states and to determine the mechanism of phase separation.</meta-value></custom-meta></custom-meta-group></article-meta></front><body><sec id="s1" sec-type="intro"><title>Introduction</title><p>Liquid-liquid phase separation underpins the formation of membraneless organelles, such as nucleoli (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib43">Lafontaine et al., 2021</xref>), P-bodies (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Brangwynne et al., 2009</xref>), stress granules (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib52">Molliex et al., 2015</xref>), cajal bodies (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib56">Neugebauer, 2017</xref>), and nuclear speckles (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Fei et al., 2017</xref>). The integrity of such organelles is maintained by interactions between biomolecules that form condensates, or liquid droplet-like structures, in which the local concentration of individual components is higher than the surrounding environment (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib78">Yang et al., 2004</xref>). These condensates cluster relevant molecules together to facilitate interactions while allowing rapid material exchange (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib78">Yang et al., 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib67">Souquere et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Dundr and Misteli, 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">Handwerger et al., 2005</xref>).

Several in vivo studies have shown that SRSF1 is found in condensates (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Fei et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Hammarskjold and Rekosh, 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">Haward et al., 2021</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib45">Lamond and Spector, 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Azpurua et al., 2021</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Ilik et al., 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib49">Li and Wang, 2021</xref>). Aberrant condensation behaviors have also been observed in disease states (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Azpurua et al., 2021</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Ilik et al., 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib49">Li and Wang, 2021</xref>). SRSF1 belongs to the Ser/Arg-rich protein family (SR proteins), which contains 12 members possessing one to two structured RNA-recognition motifs (RRMs) and a repetitive Arg/Ser repeat region (RS domain; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib66">Shepard and Hertel, 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib69">Tacke and Manley, 1995</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib65">Screaton et al., 1995</xref>). The RS region is also found in the much larger family of SR-related proteins, which contain the repetitive RS regions but not the other structural features (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Blencowe et al., 1999</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Cascarina and Ross, 2022</xref>). Two SR-related proteins, SRRM2 (serine-arginine rich repetitive matrix protein 2) and SON, are essential for the formation and structural maintenance of the membraneless organelles nuclear speckles (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Ahn et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib77">Xu et al., 2022</xref>). Like many other splicing factors, SRSF1 modulates trafficking to the speckles (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib71">Tripathi et al., 2012</xref>). It has been demonstrated that SRSF1 is found in nuclear speckles when its RS domain is partially phosphorylated but that hyperphosphorylation causes the protein to leave nuclear speckles (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Aubol et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Gui et al., 1994</xref>). It is therefore evident that RS domains play an important role in the organization of nuclear speckles. However, an understanding of the nature of that interaction has been evasive due to a difficulty solubilizing the proteins involved. As with all 12 SR proteins and many speckle components, obtaining soluble SRSF1 has been an imposing challenge for decades, and this has substantially hindered our understanding of the functions of these proteins and of nuclear speckles as a whole (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib66">Shepard and Hertel, 2009</xref>).</p><p>Phase separation is frequently mediated by repetitive sequences. Here, we find this to be the case for the protein SRSF1, whose phase separation is dependent on its RS repeats. Our bioinformatic analysis reveals a correlation of RS repeats with a tendency to phase separate. We successfully solubilize SRSF1 using short peptides that mimic RS repeats. Our success in solubilizing SRSF1 provides an unprecedented opportunity to elucidate the mechanism by which RS repeats interact with SRSF1. We find that this increase in solubility is due to a competition between the peptide and RS domains for the same binding sites on RRM domains. We further discover that acidic residues and aromatic residues from SRSF1 RRMs interact with the RS region through salt bridges and cation-pi interactions. We find that many of the RRM sites interacting with RS repeats are conserved among the SR protein family. These findings provide insight into how interactions between SR and SR-related proteins may occur within membraneless organelles. They also allow us to predict how the nature of these interactions might change when the RS domain becomes phosphorylated.</p></sec><sec id="s2" sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><sec id="s2-1"><title>RS repeats are abundant in the human proteome and associated with phase separation</title><p>RS repeats are often found in SR proteins and SR-related proteins. The serine residues in RS repeats are frequently phosphorylated, a process which regulates the functions of RS repeats. To quantify the abundance of RS repeats in the human proteome, we systematically searched for uninterrupted repeats that were 2–8 amino acids in length (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1A</xref>) and tested whether the length of RS repeats was correlated with protein condensates. Proteins were defined as being in condensates if they were listed in any of three available phase separation databases (PhaSepDB, LLPSDB, and DrLLPS) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib58">Ning et al., 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib48">Li et al., 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib79">You et al., 2020</xref>). Because both RRM domains and RS repeats have been associated with phase separation in previous studies, we separated proteins containing RRM domains in this analysis from those that did not (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib72">Wang et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib54">Murthy et al., 2019</xref>). We found that the chance that a protein was found in condensates increased with the length of RS repeats it harbored regardless of whether the protein contained an RRM domain (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1A</xref>). In our analysis, we did not distinguish RS repeats from SR repeats, and counting started with the first residue, whether it was R or S. We analyzed the correlation between the RS repeat length and the percentage of proteins found in condensates using correlation analysis (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="supp1">Supplementary file 1</xref>) and contingency tables (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="supp3">Supplementary file 3</xref>). Using correlation analysis, we found that the two-tailed Pearson’s <italic>p</italic>-value is 0.02, and the correlation coefficient is 0.93 (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="supp1">Supplementary file 1</xref>). We further extended the correlation analysis to all other possible dipeptide motifs, assuming that the order of the two amino acids in a repeat is interchangeable. As the protein population of some dipeptide motifs is low, we estimated a population-based error of <inline-formula><mml:math id="inf1"><mml:mrow><mml:mrow><mml:mn>1</mml:mn></mml:mrow><mml:mo>/</mml:mo><mml:mrow><mml:msqrt><mml:msub><mml:mrow><mml:mi>N</mml:mi></mml:mrow><mml:mrow><mml:mi>p</mml:mi><mml:mi>s</mml:mi></mml:mrow></mml:msub></mml:msqrt></mml:mrow></mml:mrow></mml:math></inline-formula> , where <italic>N<sub>ps</sub></italic> is the number of proteins containing 8-mer peptides found in condensates (as described more completely in the methods section). Applying a criterion of p-value &lt;0.05 and fraction of proteins in condensates greater than twice the population-based error, we found six dipeptide motifs showed significant correlation with phase separation: GG, KK, QQ, PP, RG, and RS (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="supp1">Supplementary file 1</xref>). Except for the KK motif, the five other dipeptide repeats have been shown to directly drive phase separation for some proteins (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib43">Lafontaine et al., 2021</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Brangwynne et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib52">Molliex et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Fei et al., 2017</xref>). It is noteworthy that among the six dipeptide motifs, RS-containing proteins have the highest percentage of 6-mer and 8-mer-containing proteins in condensates. As the sample sizes across these datasets vary widely, we performed the same analysis on 50 randomly selected size-matched subsets from each category (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="supp2">Supplementary file 2</xref>).

Among proteins with an RRM and at least one 4-mer RS repeat, the likelihood of appearance in condensates was 89%, and this trend became more pronounced as the repeat length was increased (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1A</xref>). Using contingency tables, we analyzed the correlation between the presence of RS dipeptides and the occurrence of RRM domains (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="supp3">Supplementary file 3</xref>). For proteins found in condensates, occurrence of RS dipeptides and RRM domains is clearly correlated, as shown by a p-value of 0.0013 (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="supp3">Supplementary file 3</xref>). In contrast, no significant correlation was found when the same analysis was performed on proteins not in condensates (p-value = 0.1202). As repeat length increased, the correlation between RS repeats and RRM domains also increased.</p><p>Many proteins contain multiple copies of short RS repeats. In fact, most SR and SR-related proteins have several short RS repeats instead of a few long, continuous ones (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Boucher et al., 2001</xref>). One extreme example is nuclear speckle scaffolding protein SRRM2, which has 56 4-mer RS repeats, more than any other protein (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1A</xref>). Therefore, we also analyzed how the number of short RS repeats is correlated with phase separation. We found that the number of RS repeats that a protein harbors also affects its likelihood of being found in condensates (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1B and C</xref>). In the absence of an RRM domain, on average, proteins in condensates have more copies of 2-mer or 4-mer RS repeats than those not in condensates (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1B</xref>). Further, proteins with several RS repeats and an RRM domain are particularly likely to be found in condensates (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1C</xref>, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="supp4">Supplementary file 4</xref>). Definitions of RS domains usually specify either a threshold repeat number (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Boucher et al., 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib50">Manley and Krainer, 2010</xref>) or a threshold percentage R/S composition (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Cascarina and Ross, 2022</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib50">Manley and Krainer, 2010</xref>). To test the effect of percent R/S composition on the likelihood of phase separation, we used LCD composer (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Cascarina et al., 2021</xref>). Similar to the results we found for the effect of short repeats, we found that a 20-amino acid sequence of at least 40% RS composition increased the likelihood of a protein being found in condensates from 31% to 36% (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1B and C</xref>, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="supp4">Supplementary file 4</xref>). Further addition of at least one RRM domain increased the likelihood of phase separation to 89% (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1C</xref>). In summary, we found a correlation between RS repeats and phase separation whether it was analyzed by length, number, or composition of RS repeats.</p></sec><sec id="s2-2"><title>SRSF1 can be solubilized using peptides that mimic its RS region</title><p>The correlation of RS-repeats with phase separation is consistent with observations that many RS- containing proteins have low solubility in vitro. For example, up to this point, none of the full-length SR proteins have been obtained in concentrations suitable for biophysical/biochemical or structural characterization, although the founding member of the family, SRSF1, was identified more than three decades ago (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib41">Krainer et al., 1990a</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Ge and Manley, 1990</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib42">Krainer et al., 1990b</xref>).</p><p>To overcome this obstacle in investigating SR and SR-related proteins, we aimed to develop a new purification and solubilization method using full-length SRSF1. The high Arg composition in these proteins inspired us to use high concentrations of Arg amino acid in our protocol to purify and solubilize SRSF1. An Arg/Glu mixture of 50 mM has been used to increase solubility of some RNA-binding proteins (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Golovanov et al., 2004</xref>). We found that 0.8–1 M of Arg was able to solubilize all SRSF1 constructs during the purification procedure (details in the Materials and methods section). However, the high ionic strength of Arg at this concentration range is unsuitable for many analytical methods, such as NMR and binding assays.</p><p>We predicted that we could solubilize phase-separating proteins using peptide co-solutes that mimic these repeats to compete with inter- and intra- molecular interactions (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2A</xref>). We tested this concept on SRSF1, which contains RS repeats of 16, 5, and 6 amino acids, respectively (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2B</xref>). Serine residues in these regions can be phosphorylated, resulting in an alternation of positive and negative charges (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2B</xref>). To solubilize SRSF1 in its unphosphorylated and phosphorylated forms, we therefore tested peptides of varying lengths to mimic unphosphorylated RS (RS), and phosphorylated RS (DR, and ER) repeats (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2B</xref>). Here, using the purified protein, we found that SRSF1 phase separated at concentrations lower than 300 nM in a phosphate buffer (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2C and D</xref>). This was also the case when the protein was diluted into 90 mM KCl (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2E</xref>).</p><fig-group><fig id="fig2" position="float"><label>Figure 2.</label><caption><title>SRSF1 phase separation can be reduced using peptides that best mimic its RS repeats in their respective phosphorylation states.</title><p>(<bold>A</bold>) Schematic illustration of solubilizing phase-separating proteins using short peptides.

This approach to measuring protein solubility has been used in many studies (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Burgess, 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib70">Trevino et al., 2008</xref>). If mimicking the repetitive sequences with the peptides helps resolve phase separation, we expect to see a more dramatic solubility increase when the peptide co-solutes most closely mimic the repetitive sequences of the proteins. To this end, we measured solubility of unphosphorylated full-length SRSF1, hyper-phosphorylated SRSF1 (pi-SRSF1), and RS-truncated SRSF1 (ΔRS) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2F</xref>). We found that whether phosphorylated or not, full-length SRSF1 was essentially insoluble in the 50 mM and 100 mM KCl control buffers (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2F</xref>). Previous studies have found that truncation of the RS domain increases protein solubility (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib69">Tacke and Manley, 1995</xref>). This suggests that the RS domain is responsible for the protein’s low solubility. To verify this, we measured the solubility of ΔRS and found that it was overall more soluble than full-length SRSF1 in all tested buffers (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2F</xref>). Although an Arg/Glu mixture has been reported to promote protein solubility (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Golovanov et al., 2004</xref>), Arg/Glu at 100 mM provided only a limited solubilizing effect for full-length SRSF1 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2F</xref>). Among the peptides we tested, only RS8 dramatically increased solubility of unphosphorylated SRSF1 (from 0.6±0.29 μM in 100 mM KCl to 120±12 μM with 100 mM RS8). Consistent with our hypothesis, all tested peptides had a less dramatic solubilizing effect on ΔRS, likely because it does not contain the repeat sequences that the peptides are designed to mimic. Hyper-phosphorylation of an RS domain converts the region into a basic acidic repeat resembling ER and DR repeats. To mimic a phosphorylated RS domain, we tested the solubilizing effects of ER and DR peptides (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Cho et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Feng et al., 2012</xref>). ER8 increased the solubility of hyper-phosphorylated SRSF1 (pi-SRSF1) more than other peptides. DR8 and ER4 also had substantial, albeit less pronounced, solubilizing effects (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2F</xref>). The preference for ER8 may be due to the fact that glutamic acid resembles phosphoserine more than aspartic acid in size. This confirmed our hypothesis that the solubilizing effect was more notable with peptides most closely resembling the proteins’ own repeats.</p><p>These trends are clearer when the effect of the peptides on solubility is normalized by the solubility in 100 mM Arg/Glu (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2G</xref>). Whereas peptides designed to mimic the repetitive constructs produce as much as a 30-fold increase in solubility relative to Arg/Glu, the solubility increase of ΔRS only reaches about a twofold difference (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2G</xref>). In accordance with our solubility tests, we found that using increasing concentrations of the RS8 peptide reduced the number of liquid-like droplets in solution (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2H</xref>).</p><p>We also tested the solubilizing effect of these peptide co-solutes on two other RNA-binding proteins, Nob1 and Nop9. These peptides increased solubility of Nob1 and Nop9 by 50–60% and 2–10%, respectively (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s1">Figure 2—figure supplement 1A</xref>). Nob1 contains unstructured regions rich in basic and acidic-basic residues (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s1">Figure 2—figure supplement 1B</xref>) and has an increased solubility despite its unstructured regions having a lower homology to the tested peptides. Nop9 does not have such unstructured sequence regions (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s1">Figure 2—figure supplement 1C</xref>). Consistent with our hypothesis, the tested peptides have a moderate solubilizing effect on Nob1, whereas they have limited or no effect on Nop9. These results for SRSF1 constructs, Nob1, and Nop9 suggest that repetitive peptides improve solubility for proteins that have similar sequences.</p></sec><sec id="s2-3"><title>Peptide co-solutes are compatible with NMR experiments and binding assays</title><p>Ionic co-solutes usually increase the dielectric constant of a sample and complicate NMR data acquisition, producing difficulty in probe tuning/matching, elongation of pulse width, and reduction of sensitivity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib74">Wider and Dreier, 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">Kelly et al., 2002</xref>).

Therefore, we examined the spectra and pulse width of different combinations of peptides and Arginine (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s1">Figure 3—figure supplement 1</xref>).

Inter- and intra- molecular interactions should still occur under these conditions. However, they should be weakened enough to prevent droplet formation, providing us with a stable sample that can be used to study the intermolecular interactions that lead to the initiation of phase separation.

Some proteins experience salting out when ionic co-solutes are introduced (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib54">Murthy et al., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib62">Ryan et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib51">Martin et al., 2021</xref>). For example, we found that the solubility of SRSF1 is around 2–7 μM in 1–5 M of NaCl (data not shown).</p><p>The protein solubilizing strategy used here is of wide applicability, not just confined to the examples of SRSF1 and Nob1. Our bioinformatic search revealed that RS-containing proteins are highly abundant and that there is a positive correlation between these repeats and phase separation. In addition to RS repeats, GG, KK, QQ, PP, and RG demonstrated both a strong positive correlation between repeat length and phase separation and robust enough sample sizes to render these results significant (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="supp1">Supplementary file 1</xref>). However, it is important to note that the repeats mentioned above are likely not a comprehensive list of repetitive sequences conducive to phase separation. In fact, aside from LL, SG, PL, and TA repeats, all dipeptides that exist in 8-mer sequences possess at least a weak positive correlation between repeat length and tendency to appear in condensates (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="supp1">Supplementary file 1</xref>). It is also important to note that with our current knowledge, there is a possibility for both overestimation and underestimation of phase-separating proteins when using these databases. Some proteins that phase separate may not yet be identified. Further, proteins reported to be in condensates do not necessarily phase separate on their own. It is also possible that a protein can have more than one type of repeated motif mediating phase separation. For these reasons, in vitro phase separation experiments using purified protein are imperative. We hope that the use of this method will expand the number of techniques available to perform such experiments. Development of peptide structure-activity relationships (SARs) may serve as a technique for identifying the repeats responsible for phase separation as well. For instance, if a SAR reveals that a protein with more than one repetitive sequence reaches optimum solubility with one particular peptide mimic, the repetitive sequence corresponding to the peptide mimic may contribute more towards driving phase separation. Likewise, if a SAR reveals that a mixture of multiple mimic peptides is optimal for enhancing solubility, it is possible that multiple repetitive sequences within the protein are responsible for phase separation.</p><p>Characterization of intermolecular interactions that occur in the dispersed (soluble) state is an accepted method of understanding what interactions lead to phase separation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib55">Murthy and Fawzi, 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib62">Ryan et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Emmanouilidis et al., 2021</xref>). A previous comparison of intermolecular PRE spectra of the protein FUS in the dispersed versus the condensed (phase separated) state indicated that the transient intermolecular interactions seen between molecules in the solution state are comparable to the intermolecular contacts seen when the protein is phase separated (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib54">Murthy et al., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib53">Monahan et al., 2017</xref> as discussed in <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib55">Murthy and Fawzi, 2020</xref>). Our technique is unique in that it provides transient competition for the intermolecular interactions that lead to phase separation without abolishing these interactions entirely. We find that both RNA binding (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s1">Figure 3—figure supplement 1</xref>) and homotypic intermolecular interactions (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4E</xref>) can still occur in a peptide-containing buffer. However, the presence of the peptide weakens intermolecular interactions enough to allow high quality NMR spectra to be obtained.</p><p>Here, we find that targeted competition for intermolecular interactions provides direct control over the critical point for phase separation, enabling experiments to be performed in the dispersed state that otherwise might not be possible. The ability to compare dispersed and condensed states for more proteins is still desirable. NMR spectra of isolated low complexity domains in the condensed state have been obtained successfully for several proteins including HNRNPA2, FUS, and a Caprin1-pFMRP complex (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib54">Murthy et al., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib62">Ryan et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib75">Wong et al., 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">Kim et al., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Burke et al., 2015</xref>). However, interactions between the structured domains and low complexity domains of these proteins have not yet been probed using these techniques. One bottleneck to obtaining usable condensed state samples involves obtaining high concentrations of soluble protein before inducing phase separation in the sample (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib54">Murthy et al., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib62">Ryan et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib75">Wong et al., 2020</xref>). Due to the high concentrations needed for an NMR backbone assignment and the negative effect of sample viscosity on NMR spectral quality, it is also more practical to perform backbone assignments of proteins in the dispersed states (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib54">Murthy et al., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib62">Ryan et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib75">Wong et al., 2020</xref>). We hope our method may serve as a useful tool in expanding these techniques.</p><p>Homotypic intermolecular interactions and interactions with the peptides involve residues similar to those involved in intramolecular interactions. However, intermolecular interactions seem to have a greater preference for the more negatively charged RRM1. Whereas interactions with RRM1 appear at all concentrations studied, a concentration of 25 mM peptide is needed to observe bleaching of W134 and A150 on the electropositive RRM2 domain (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4C</xref>). This difference may be due to the fact that, while intramolecular interactions involve an RS domain tethered to RRM2 that helps facilitate interaction, external RS repeats do not have a method of compensating for this charge repulsion.</p><p>This preference for RRM1 is interesting because the interactions seen on RRM2 involve the same residues that bind to RNA (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Cléry et al., 2013</xref>), but the interactions on RRM1 are opposite the RNA-binding interface (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Cléry et al., 2021</xref>). In fact, chemical shift perturbations performed in a previous study indicate that the α1 helical residues on RRM1, in particular, remain virtually unaffected when two different RNA ligands are introduced, indicating there are also no allosteric effects (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Cléry et al., 2021</xref>). Further, negative charges in this region are conserved across multiple SR protein family members (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6</xref>). This suggests that RRM domains of SR proteins may have alternative sites used to mediate the protein-protein interactions that lead to phase separation. This is important because it means that the effect of phase separation on RNA binding can potentially be studied by disruption of these distal sites.</p><p>As we learn more about biomolecular condensates, it is of interest to understand what causes proteins to migrate to one condensate over another. It has been shown that the isolated SRSF2 RRM can localize to speckles on its own (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Greig et al., 2020</xref>), which suggests there may be an additional molecular grammar within the structured components of these proteins that directs them towards nuclear speckles. It is known that speckles rely on RS repeats as scaffolds, as truncation of SRRM2’s regions containing RS repeats (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1</xref>) disrupts speckles (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Ilik et al., 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib77">Xu et al., 2022</xref>). It is possible that these RS repeats function in part by providing multiple interaction sites for this type of RRM.</p><sec id="s3-1"><title>Ideas and speculation</title><p>We demonstrate that electronegative α<sub>1</sub> and α<sub>2</sub> helices along with neighboring aromatic residues serve as interacting sites for unphosphorylated RS repetitive sequences. This finding has implications for how phosphorylation might change interactions within the speckles. If negatively charged residues are important for maintaining protein-protein interactions, charge repulsion between a hyperphosphorylated tail and acidic residues might be one reason that SR proteins leave the speckles upon hyperphosphorylation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Gui et al., 1994</xref>). Phosphoserines of RS repeats have been proposed to form salt bridges with neighboring arginine residues (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Hamelberg et al., 2007</xref>), although any such contacts are likely short-lived and do not result in a stable secondary structure (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib57">Ngo et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib76">Xiang et al., 2013</xref>). Temporary phosphoserine-arginine contacts may be sufficient to compete with the highly transient cation-pi stacking interactions that we observe here.</p></sec></sec><sec id="s4" sec-type="materials|methods"><title>Materials and methods</title><sec id="s4-1"><title>SRSF1 expression and purification</title><p>The DNA encoding human SRSF1 was sub-cloned into pSMT3 using BamH I and Hind III.

0.548.</p><p>These Xplor-NIH structures were used to produce an MD-simulation starting structure with 4 peptides and 1 SRSF1 ΔRS structure. The structure was further refined using AMBER20 with the ff19SB forcefield. Solvation was performed with explicit TIP3P water molecules with 0.15 M NaCl used to balance the charges. The simulation temperature was set to 300 K, and the cutoff distance of nonbonded interactions was set to 10 Å. A simulation in which no restraints were applied was run for 201 ns. This simulation accounted for bleached residues, which, with the exception of residue 88, remained within the expected 12–15 Å from the paramagnetic probe. For residue 88, a separate simulation was run for 17 ns in which a distance restraint was used. The distance restraint maintained an interaction between F88 and peptide 2 that was generated by Xplor-NIH and consistent with the bleaching on the PRE spectrum. Distance restraints were not applied to other sites. Whereas the 10 peptides in the Xplor-NIH models accounted for all PRE data, the four peptides were only sufficient to cover the hotspot regions. For the remaining residues on the α<sub>1</sub> and α<sub>2</sub> helices, four peptides only partially accounted for PRE data (<italic>R</italic>=0.681 for residues 29–38 and 64–74), and four peptides and was not sufficient to account for the PRE values across the molecule as a whole (<italic>R</italic>=0.136).</p><p>During the simulation, the nature of interactions within the hotspots changed in some cases, but the distance between peptides and bleached residues did not significantly change. The MD trajectory analysis was performed by CPPTRAJ.</p></sec><sec id="s4-8"><title>Bioinformatics analysis</title><p>Domain annotations and sequences for human proteins were obtained from the Uniprot website. Analysis was restricted to full-length, reviewed, human proteins for which there was evidence at the protein level. A Python script was used to search for consecutive Ser-Arg or Arg-Ser repeats of 4, 6, or 8 amino acids. Identification of proteins in condensates was based on databases PhaSepDB (PhaSepDB2.0 download), DrLLPs, and LLPSDB (natural protein download).</p><p>RRM domains were identified by further restricting our Uniprot search to proteins containing RRM domains of any manual assertion. In analysis of the correlation between condensation, RS repeats, and RRM domains, we found 206 proteins that together contained 365 RRM domains. Python scripts and bioinformatic data can be accessed via the github link: <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://github.com/taliafargason/Repeats_in_Condensates">https://github.com/taliafargason/Repeats_in_Condensates</ext-link> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Fargason, 2023</xref>).</p><p>Percent composition values were obtained using the program LCD composer developed by Sean Cascarina in the Ross lab (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Cascarina et al., 2021</xref>). Search was conducted for sequences 20 amino acids in length with at least 5% composition R/S.

Only proteins in category x=0 were automatically excluded from other categories. For instance, if a protein had a 16-mer RG repeat, it would be counted in the x&gt;2, x&gt;4, x&gt;6, and x&gt;8 categories but not x=0. Likewise, if a protein had neither ‘RG’ nor ‘GR’ anywhere in its sequence, it would be counted in the x=0 category only. Only the length of the longest uninterrupted repeat was considered.

Your article has been reviewed by 2 peer reviewers, and the evaluation has been overseen by Douglas Black as the Reviewing Editor and James Manley as the Senior Editor. The following individual involved in the review of your submission has agreed to reveal their identity: Douglas J Kojetin (Reviewer #2).</p><p>The reviewers have discussed their reviews with one another, and the Reviewing Editor has drafted this to help you prepare a revised submission. This paper addresses a major limitation in the study of SRSF1, a critical and well-known alternative splicing factor. SRSF1 and other members of this family exhibit limited solubility due to their tendency to undergo liquid phase separation driven by their RS domains. The authors tested the hypothesis that short RS repeat peptides might compete with the intermolecular interactions that drive phase separation, and allow sufficient solubilization for biochemical and structural studies. The data convincingly show that short peptides with RS, ER, or DR repeats can render recombinant SRSF1 soluble. They go on to analyze the newly concentrated protein by NMR and present well-resolved and assignable NMR spectra of SRSF1 dissolved with RS8 as a co-solute. The authors use paramagnetic relaxation enhancement experiments to map interactions between RS8 and SRSF1. Their findings suggest that the peptide interactions with the RNA binding domains (RRMs) are similar to those of the RS domain and are mediated by a combination of ionic interactions between arginine and acidic side chains, and pi-stacking interactions with surface-exposed hydrophobic residues.</p><p>A second part of the study seeks to identify features of proteins that make them more likely to undergo phase separations. The authors use a bioinformatics approach to correlate the presence of RS repeats with the identity of proteins in databases of phase-separated material. They also use molecular modeling and software tools to predict additional RRM domains that might be prone to phase separation by looking for those containing acidic amino acids with neighboring surface-exposed aromatic/hydrophobic residues. These findings are much less convincing than the structural and biochemical studies. The findings for SR proteins, which localize to nuclear speckles are extrapolated to all kinds of RNA-binding proteins and cellular condensates. The observed fold enrichments are small. The sample sizes decrease rapidly with increasing repeat length, and it is not clear if the appropriate statistical tests were performed to correct for multiple hypothesis testing. Importantly, these predictions derived from the computational analyses are not tested experimentally.</p><p>Overall, the reviewers found the NMR and PRE data to be convincing. The use of short RS, ER, and DR peptides as co-solutes for insoluble SR-domain proteins is a novel and clever advance. The computational analyses are incomplete and over-interpreted. These findings would require experimental validation.</p><p>The reviewers and editor all found the solubilization and structural data presented in Figures 1 to 6A to be a valuable advance. However, the computational studies of Figure 6 B – F were found to be too preliminary and need validation to add much value to the manuscript. It is recommended that the authors remove Figure 6 B – F, or provide experimental validation for their interpretations of these findings. The paper should be revised to emphasize Figures 1 – 6A, to address the following essential points.</p><p>Essential revisions:</p><p>1.

In figure 1A, the sample size between no RS, 2RS, 4RS, … varies by quite a bit.

Here again, it would be useful to know whether the p-values corrected for multiple hypothesis testing.</p><p>5. It should be relatively straightforward to test the model presented in the discussion, i.e. that acidic residues with neighboring hydrophobic residues are predictive of RRM proteins that localize to nuclear speckles. A mutational analysis demonstrating a change in speckle localization in cells, or even solubility in vitro, would help to test this model's validity.</p><p><italic>Reviewer #2 (Recommendations for the authors):</italic></p><p>Results section, 1st paragraph: The annotation of proteins that are present in condensates in the phase separation databases likely represents the minimal numbers as there are likely proteins not yet reported that can form or go into condensates.

From these two sets of simulations, we observed similar percentage differences for proteins with different RS lengths. Therefore, the difference we observed is not due to sample size.</p><p>Our work is focused on RS-containing proteins, which include both SR proteins and SR-related proteins. The first SR protein, SRSF1, was discovered by Dr. Manley and Dr. Krainer over 30 years ago. The field uses their definition of the SR protein family. The SR protein family was originally defined as: any protein that has one or two N-terminal RRMs, followed by a downstream RS domain of at least 50 amino acids with &gt; 40% RS content, characterized by consecutive RS or SR repeats. In addition to domain and amino acid composition, biological functions and posttranslational modifications are also considerations in defining SR proteins. Based on these criteria, twelve proteins are classified as SR proteins. The proteins that have RS repeats but do not meet all criteria are classified as SR-related or SR-like proteins.</p><p>It is noteworthy that the definition of SR-related proteins is ambiguous. Proposed standards are either based on percent composition(1) or number of 2mer and 4mer repeats(2), not a threshold length. Most SR or SR-like proteins have interrupted RS repeats. For this reason, the population of proteins decreases dramatically along with increased RS length. The longest uninterrupted RS region (16 aa, 8 dipeptide repeats) is found in SRSF1. Therefore, we searched for short RS repeats (2-8aa). We noticed similar trends when we searched by percent enrichment rather than repeat number, which we have added to our supplemental. A discussion of this has been added to the Results section.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>2. In Figure 1A, the authors should also assess other dipeptides and their repeats. It seems reasonably straightforward to repeat this analysis with every possible dipeptide to assess whether there is something special about SR, or if similar enrichments are seen with other dipeptide combinations, perhaps derived from other types of low-complexity domains.</p></disp-quote><p>We appreciate this insightful comment. As suggested, we analyzed how phase separation tendency is correlated with repeat length for all dipeptide motifs. In our analysis, we assumed that the two amino acids are interchangeable. For example, RS and SR motifs are considered the same motif. In total, we analyzed 210 dipeptide motifs (190 motifs with two different amino acids, and 20 motifs with the same amino acid). Two criteria were used to select dipeptide motifs whose length is reliably correlated to phase separation. The first criterion is that the Pearson correlation p-value is smaller than 0.05. The second one is that error of the phase separation probability is smaller than half of the fraction of proteins in condensates. The error was calculated as <inline-formula><mml:math id="sa2m1"><mml:mstyle displaystyle="true" scriptlevel="0"><mml:mrow><mml:mn>1</mml:mn><mml:mrow><mml:mo>/</mml:mo></mml:mrow><mml:msqrt><mml:msub><mml:mi>N</mml:mi><mml:mrow><mml:mtext>ps</mml:mtext></mml:mrow></mml:msub></mml:msqrt></mml:mrow></mml:mstyle></mml:math></inline-formula>, where <italic>N<sub>ps</sub></italic> is the number of proteins with 8-mers found condensates. This estimation resembles the margin of error. The second criterion is related to the number of proteins and therefore reflects the stability of the data point. This criterion filters out the repeats that have only a few proteins (usually 1 or 2). In total, 6 motifs pass these criteria: GG, KK, QQ, PP, RG, and RS. Of these dipeptide repeats, proteins regions rich in Gly, Gln, Pro, RG/RGG, and RS have been reported to drive phase separation. It is noteworthy that 8-mer RS-containing proteins and 6-mer RS-containing proteins have the highest tendency to phase separate among all of these motifs.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>3.

In Figure 1B, we are testing the hypothesis that the number of RS repeats is correlated with a tendency to appear in condensates. However, RRM domains are also correlated with both phase separation and RS repeats. Because many RS-containing proteins have RRM domains, we separated these two variables.</p><p>You bring up a great point that this results in two factors (RRM, phase separation) being analyzed against RS repeat number. To eliminate the possibility that random chance produces a spuriously low <italic>p</italic>-value, we also performed Bonferroni’s adjustment for two hypothesis testing, which would make our significance threshold 0.025 rather than 0.05. In Figure 1B, we considered the difference between columns 1 and 2 (p &lt; 0.0001) and the difference between columns 5 and 6 (p = 0.0014) to be significant. In contrast, we found the difference between columns 3 and 4 (p = 0.139) and the difference between columns 7 and 8 (0.1449) to not be significant. These <italic>p</italic>-values were obtained using the Mann-Whitney test, which is suitable for a sample size &gt; 30 as well as a situation in which sample sizes are very different and distribution is not normal.

In total, 100 Xplor-NIH structures were calculated using the ensemble size of 10. In Xplor-NIH calculations, the RRM1/RRM2 linker and RS peptides were allowed full range of motion. RRM1 was held in place, and RRM2 was allowed to move as a group. Each Xplor-NIH structure had 1 peptide (resulting in 10 peptides total in the ensemble). The ensemble structure that best fit the PRE data had a Q factor of 0.419 and Pearson Correlation Coefficient of 0.938 Using the top Xplor NIH structures, we created a starting structure for MD simulation with 4 peptides (one for each of the major PRE hotspots). This structure did not fully account for all PRE values but met the distance expectations for bleached residues (&lt;12-15 Å). Two MD simulations are shown in this paper—one in which no restraints were applied and one in which peptide 2 was held in contact with residue F88 on the loop region following the β<sub>4</sub> strand. During the simulation, the nature of interactions within the hotspots changed in some cases, but the distance between peptides and bleached residues did not significantly change. The MD trajectory analysis was performed by CPPTRAJ.</p></body></sub-article></article>
