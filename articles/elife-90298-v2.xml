However, tumour cells undergoing EMT have not been observed disseminating into the tissue surrounding human tumour specimens, leaving the relevance to human cancer uncertain. We have previously identified both EpCAM and CD24 as CSC markers that, alongside the mesenchymal marker Vimentin, identify EMT CSCs in human oral cancer cell lines. This afforded the opportunity to investigate whether the combination of these three markers can identify disseminating EMT CSCs in actual human tumours. Examining disseminating tumour cells in over 12,000 imaging fields from 74 human oral tumours, we see a significant enrichment of EpCAM, CD24 and Vimentin co-stained cells disseminating beyond the tumour body in metastatic specimens. Through training an artificial neural network, these predict metastasis with high accuracy (cross-validated accuracy of 87–89%). In this study, we have observed single disseminating EMT CSCs in human oral cancer specimens, and these are highly predictive of metastatic disease.</p></abstract><abstract abstract-type="plain-language-summary"><title>eLife digest</title><p>When oral cancers metastasise – that is, when tumour cells invade other parts of the body – they typically do so by first colonizing the lymph nodes present in the neck. As this event significantly reduces chances of survival, oral cancer patients often have their neck lymph nodes removed to prevent the spread of the disease. However, this surgery carries risks and leads to longer hospital stays, stressing the need for better ways to predict which oral tumours will metastasise.</p><p>Evidence from lab-grown cells and mice studies suggest that, in oral cancer, metastasis occurs when some cells in the original tumour go through a process called the epithelial-mesenchymal transition (EMT for short). This transformation allows the cells to detach from the tumour and become invasive. However, it has so far been difficult to observe this process in actual human tumours; this is partly because cells undergoing EMT stop producing the proteins that scientists rely on to distinguish cancer and healthy cells.</p><p>To address this knowledge gap, Youssef et al. focused on three proteins: two tumour markers, EpCAM and CD24; and Vimentin, which is produced in greater quantities in the invasive mesenchymal state. Previous work had shown that a specific population of oral tumour cells can continue to express all three proteins even when adopting a mesenchymal identity through EMT.</p><p>Based on this knowledge, Youssef et al. hypothesised that tracking Vimentin, EpCAM and CD24 using fluorescence microscopy would allow them to identify metastasising cells in human samples. An analysis of over 12,000 images from 74 tumours obtained from surgeries revealed that, in the metastatic samples, the cells detaching from primary tumours were more likely to express these three proteins. Finally, Youssef et al. used these images to train a machine learning algorithm. When applied to data from new oral cancer patients, the programme was able to predict whether their tumours were likely to spread with 89% accuracy. If confirmed by further work, and in particular on larger samples, these findings could in the future help clinicians decide which patients with oral cancer would benefit the most from surgery to remove neck lymph nodes.</p></abstract><kwd-group kwd-group-type="author-keywords"><kwd>cancer stem cell</kwd><kwd>oral cancer</kwd><kwd>metastasis</kwd><kwd>machine learning</kwd><kwd>multiplexed imaging</kwd><kwd>prognosis</kwd></kwd-group><kwd-group kwd-group-type="research-organism"><title>Research organism</title><kwd>Human</kwd></kwd-group><funding-group><award-group id="fund1"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100009323</institution-id><institution>Animal Free Research UK</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Youssef</surname><given-names>Gehad</given-names></name><name><surname>Philpott</surname><given-names>Michael P</given-names></name><name><surname>Biddle</surname><given-names>Adrian</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund2"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100015999</institution-id><institution>Oracle Cancer Trust</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Ambler</surname><given-names>Leah</given-names></name><name><surname>Biddle</surname><given-names>Adrian</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund3"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100010757</institution-id><institution>National Centre for the Replacement Refinement and Reduction of Animals in Research</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>NC/S001573/1</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Scemama</surname><given-names>Alice</given-names></name><name><surname>Biddle</surname><given-names>Adrian</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><funding-statement>The funders had no role in study design, data collection and interpretation, or the decision to submit the work for publication.</funding-statement></funding-group><custom-meta-group><custom-meta specific-use="meta-only"><meta-name>Author impact statement</meta-name><meta-value>Cancer stem cells that have undergone EMT are identified in the region surrounding metastatic human oral tumours in a retrospective cohort study, and these are predictive of metastatic outcome in an image-based machine learning approach.</meta-value></custom-meta></custom-meta-group></article-meta></front><body><sec id="s1" sec-type="intro"><title>Introduction</title><p>In multiple types of carcinoma, cancer stem cells (CSCs) undergo epithelial-mesenchymal transition (EMT) to enable metastatic dissemination from the primary tumour (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Biddle et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Lawson et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Liu et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Ruscetti et al., 2016</xref>). This model of metastatic dissemination has been built from studies using murine models and human cancer cell line models. However, this process has not been observed in human tumours in the in vivo setting, leading to uncertainty over the relevance of these findings to human tumour metastasis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Bill and Christofori, 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Williams et al., 2019</xref>). A key complication with efforts to study metastatic processes in human tumours is the inability to trace cell lineage. As cancer cells exiting the tumour downregulate epithelial markers whilst undergoing EMT, they become indistinguishable from the mesenchymal non-tumour cells surrounding the tumour (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Li and Kang, 2016</xref>). Therefore, once these cells detach from the tumour body and move away they are lost to analysis. Attempts have been made to use the retention of epithelial markers alongside acquisition of mesenchymal markers to identify cells undergoing EMT in human tumours (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Bronsert et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Jensen et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Puram et al., 2017</xref>). However, these studies were limited to characterising cells undergoing the earliest stages of EMT whilst still attached to the cohesive body of the primary tumour.</p><p>EMT must be followed by the reverse process of mesenchymal-to-epithelial transition (MET) to enable new tumour growth at secondary sites, and therefore retained plasticity manifested as ability to revert to an epithelial phenotype is an important feature of metastatic CSCs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Ocaña et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Tsai et al., 2012</xref>). We have previously demonstrated that a CD44<sup>high</sup>EpCAM<sup>low/-</sup> EMT population can be separated from the main CD44<sup>low</sup>EpCAM<sup>high</sup> epithelial population in flow cytometric analysis of oral squamous cell carcinoma (OSCC) cell lines and fresh tumour specimens (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Biddle et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Biddle et al., 2011</xref>). We identified retained cell surface expression of EpCAM (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Biddle et al., 2011</xref>) and CD24 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Biddle et al., 2016</xref>) in a minority of cells that have undergone a full morphological EMT. Both EpCAM and CD24 were individually associated with enhanced ability to undergo MET, and thus are markers of EMT CSCs exhibiting retained plasticity. We therefore reasoned that retention of one or both of these markers may identify an important population of tumour cells that have undergone EMT and disseminated from the primary tumour in human tumour specimens, and are responsible for subsequent metastatic seeding. Here, we characterise the combined role of EpCAM and CD24 in marking a population of disseminating tumour cells in human OSCC specimens. Staining for EpCAM and CD24 alongside the mesenchymal marker Vimentin in over 12,000 imaging fields from 74 human tumours, stratified on metastatic status, identifies cells that have undergone EMT and disseminated into the stromal region surrounding metastatic primary tumours. Using an image-based machine learning approach, we show that the presence of these EMT CSCs in the tumour stroma is predictive of metastasis.</p></sec><sec id="s2" sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><sec id="s2-1"><title>Identification of human tumour cells that have undergone an EMT and disseminated into the surrounding stromal region</title><p>The retention of EpCAM expression in a sub-population of tumour cells that have undergone EMT raised the prospect that we may be able to identify these cells outside of the tumour body in human tumour specimens, as EpCAM is a specific epithelial marker that would not normally be found in the surrounding stromal region. In combination with EpCAM, we stained tumour specimens for CD24 as a second marker of plastic EMT CSCs, and Vimentin as a mesenchymal marker to identify cells that have undergone EMT. Notably, CD44 cannot be used as an EMT marker in the context of intact tissue as it requires trypsin degradation in order to yield differential expression in EMT and epithelial populations (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Biddle et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Mack and Gires, 2008</xref>). Vimentin, on the other hand, accurately distinguishes EMT from epithelial tumour cells in immunofluorescent staining protocols (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Biddle et al., 2016</xref>). By combining EpCAM as a tumour lineage and EMT CSC marker, Vimentin as a mesenchymal marker, and CD24 as a plastic EMT CSC marker, we aimed to identify tumour cells that have undergone EMT and disseminated into the surrounding stromal region. For this, we developed a protocol for automated four-colour (three markers +nuclear stain) immunofluorescent imaging and analysis of entire histopathological slide specimens, to test for co-localisation of the three markers in each individual cell across each specimen.</p><p>To determine whether this marker combination identifies EMT CSCs, we initially tested the protocol on the CA1 OSCC cell line and an EMT CSC sub-line that is a derivative of this cell line (EMT-stem sub-line; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Biddle et al., 2016</xref>). EpCAM<sup>+</sup>Vim<sup>+</sup>CD24<sup>+</sup> cells were greatly enriched in the EMT-stem sub-line, comprising 41% of the population, compared to 2.1% in the CA1 line (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1A, B and E</xref>). Cells with this staining profile were absent from normal keratinocyte culture and cancer associated fibroblast culture (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1</xref>). To test the specific role of EpCAM retention, we replaced EpCAM with a pan-keratin antibody against epithelial keratins. There was very little Pan-keratin<sup>+</sup>Vim<sup>+</sup>CD24<sup>+</sup> staining, and no enrichment for Pan-keratin<sup>+</sup>Vim<sup>+</sup>CD24<sup>+</sup> cells in the EMT-stem sub-line (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1C, D and E</xref>). Therefore, whilst epithelial keratins are lost, EpCAM is retained in cells undergoing EMT and an EpCAM<sup>+</sup>Vim<sup>+</sup>CD24<sup>+</sup> staining profile can be used as a marker for EMT CSCs in immunofluorescent staining protocols.</p><fig-group><fig id="fig1" position="float"><label>Figure 1.</label><caption><title>Immunofluorescent co-staining for EpCAM, Vimentin and CD24 identifies the EMT stem cell state.</title><p>(<bold>A–D</bold>) Immunofluorescent staining for EpCAM, Vimentin and CD24 (<bold>A, B</bold>) and pan-keratin, Vimentin and CD24 (<bold>C, D</bold>) in the CA1 cell line (<bold>A, C</bold>) and the EMT-stem CA1 sub-line (<bold>B, D</bold>).

Expression of EpCAM, Vimentin and CD24 was then analysed for every nucleated cell in every imaging field that included both tumour and stroma (3500 manually curated imaging fields across the 24 tumours). This enabled the proportion of each cell type in each region to be quantified (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2F</xref>). EpCAM<sup>+</sup>Vim<sup>+</sup>CD24<sup>+</sup> cells were enriched in the stroma compared to the tumour body, and there was a much greater accumulation of EpCAM<sup>+</sup>Vim<sup>+</sup>CD24<sup>+</sup> cells in the stroma of metastatic tumours compared to non-metastatic tumours. Interestingly, this was not the case for EpCAM<sup>+</sup>Vim<sup>+</sup>CD24<sup>-</sup> cells, which were also enriched in the stroma but showed no difference between metastatic and non-metastatic tumours. Pan-keratin<sup>+</sup>Vim<sup>+</sup>CD24<sup>+</sup> cells were not detected.</p><p>To extend this analysis, we stained and imaged a further 59 tumour slides from 54 regions across 50 additional tumours, stratified on the same criteria. These displayed the same evidence of individual disseminating cells co-expressing EpCAM, Vimentin and CD24 in metastatic tumours only (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2G</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s1">Figure 2—figure supplements 1</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s2">2</xref>). For these tumours, using a variation on the previous image segmentation protocol (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s3">Figure 2—figure supplement 3A–D</xref>), the proportion of EpCAM<sup>+</sup>Vim<sup>+</sup>CD24<sup>+</sup> and EpCAM<sup>+</sup>Vim<sup>+</sup>CD24<sup>-</sup> cells was quantified for each cell in over 9000 imaging fields at the tumour-stroma boundary (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s3">Figure 2—figure supplement 3E</xref>).

In this dataset, tumour and non-tumour cells were separated using bioinformatic techniques (principally inferred CNV and a ‘tumour-epithelial’ expression signature). Analysing this dataset for EpCAM, Vimentin and CD24 co-expression, we found that 12% of tumour cells (267/2215) were EpCAM<sup>+</sup>Vim<sup>+</sup>CD24<sup>+</sup>. In the non-tumour cells, only 0.8% (29/3687) were EpCAM<sup>+</sup>Vim<sup>+</sup>CD24<sup>+</sup> (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s4">Figure 2—figure supplement 4</xref>). Therefore, the observed EpCAM<sup>+</sup>Vim<sup>+</sup>CD24<sup>+</sup> cells in our tumour specimens are highly likely to be a tumour cell population. Indeed, use of EpCAM as a tumour lineage marker is specifically intended to exclude staining for stromal constituents. EpCAM is a specific epithelial marker, that is not expressed in stromal or immune cells – it is expressed exclusively in epithelia and epithelial-derived tumours (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Keller et al., 2019</xref>).</p><p>These findings demonstrate that an EpCAM<sup>+</sup>Vim<sup>+</sup>CD24<sup>+</sup> staining profile marks tumour cells disseminating into the surrounding stroma, and that these cells are enriched specifically in metastatic tumours. The presence of disseminating tumour cells that express EpCAM but not CD24 did not correlate with metastasis. This highlights a requirement for the plasticity marker CD24, when identifying disseminating metastatic CSCs.</p></sec><sec id="s2-2"><title>Identification of EpCAM<sup>+</sup>CD24<sup>+</sup>Vim<sup>+</sup> CSCs enables clinical prediction using a machine learning approach</title><p>OSCC are an important health burden and one of the top ten cancers worldwide, with over 300,000 cases annually and a 50% 5-year survival rate. There is frequent metastatic spread to the lymph nodes of the neck; this is the single most important predictor of outcome and an important factor in treatment decisions (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Sano and Myers, 2007</xref>). If spread to the lymph nodes is suspected, OSCC resection is accompanied by neck dissection to remove the draining lymph nodes, a procedure with significant morbidity. At presentation it is currently very difficult to determine which tumours are metastatic and this results in sub-optimal tailoring of treatment decisions. Accurate prediction of metastasis would therefore have great potential to improve clinical management of the disease to reduce both mortality and treatment-related morbidity. We sought to determine whether the EpCAM<sup>+</sup>CD24<sup>+</sup>Vim<sup>+</sup> staining pattern could be predictive of metastasis.</p><p>Starting with the EpCAM, Vimentin and CD24 immunofluorescence grey levels for each nucleated cell, we used a supervised machine learning approach to predict whether an imaging field comes from a metastatic or non-metastatic tumour (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3A</xref>). As a benchmark we used the pan-keratin, Vimentin and CD24 immunofluorescence grey levels, as we hypothesised that pan-keratin would provide an inferior predictive value than EpCAM given that there was no dissemination of pan-keratin expressing cells in the stroma. A total of 3500 imaging fields containing 2,640,000 total nucleated cells from 24 tumour specimens were used in the machine learning task. We compared the performance accuracy (10-fold cross-validated F-score) of different machine learning classification algorithms. The best performing classifiers for EpCAM, Vimentin and CD24 were the artificial neural network (ANN) and support vector machine (SVM), with F1 accuracy scores of 91% and 87% respectfully (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3B</xref>). For the ANN, the area under the curve (AUC) accuracy score was 87%, with 94% sensitivity and 82% specificity. Training with Pan-keratin, Vimentin and CD24 gave much worse prediction across all classifiers (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3C</xref>). These findings demonstrate that, utilising a machine learning algorithm, staining for EpCAM, Vimentin and CD24 can predict metastatic status with high accuracy and may therefore have clinical utility.</p><fig id="fig3" position="float"><label>Figure 3.</label><caption><title>Predicting metastasis using EpCAM, Vimentin and CD24 immunofluorescent staining and a supervised machine learning approach.</title><p>(<bold>A</bold>) Pipeline for machine learning based on grey level intensities for the three markers in tumour cohort 1.

We stained and imaged 59 tumour slides from 54 regions across 50 tumours, stratified on the same criteria as the previous cohort, for EpCAM, Vimentin and CD24. We conducted a blinded test of 10 fields of view from each slide, to determine whether the ANN trained using the previous 24 specimens could predict the metastatic status of these new specimens. Taking the majority prediction from the 10 fields of view from each slide, the ANN correctly predicted metastatic status for 54/59 slides (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="supp2">Supplementary file 2</xref>). Next, we determined whether the increased input available from this new cohort could yield improved predictive accuracy. Over 9000 imaging fields at the tumour-stroma boundary, containing over 8.5 million nucleated cells, were fed into a new ANN machine learning task. For this task, we recorded the predictive accuracy from the training and validation sets after each training round (‘epoch’), which showed good alignment and an 89% accuracy score after 12 training epochs (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3D</xref>). Interestingly, this is a similar accuracy to the previous ANN trained using 3500 imaging fields from 24 specimens, suggesting that feeding more imaging data into the ANN may only improve prediction up to a point.</p><p>Finally, to test whether an imaging-based machine learning approach provides increased predictive accuracy over simpler approaches, we compared our ANN trained using image pixel intensity values to ANNs trained using summary data. These were trained using the CD24<sup>+</sup>EpCAM<sup>+</sup>VIM<sup>+</sup>-positive cell counts for each field of view, separated into tumour body and stroma using our imaging segmentation pipeline (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2E and F</xref>). We used a dummy ANN fed with random gaussian signals as a baseline. The resulting ROC curves (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3E</xref>) demonstrate that only the ANN trained using image pixel intensity values has predictive utility in our cohort.</p><p>To our knowledge, this is the first time immunofluorescent staining of human tumour tissue specimens has been used in a machine learning pipeline for clinical prediction. Previous studies using cytokeratin immunohistochemistry, clinicopathological data and serum biomarkers for clinical prediction via machine learning have achieved AUCs of 75% in breast cancer (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Tseng et al., 2019</xref>), 80% in OSCC (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Bur et al., 2019</xref>), and 82% in colorectal cancer (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Takamatsu et al., 2019</xref>).</p></sec></sec><sec id="s3" sec-type="discussion"><title>Discussion</title><p>The role of EMT in tumour dissemination has long been debated but, lacking evidence of cells undergoing EMT whilst disseminating from human tumours in vivo, this role has had to be inferred from mouse models and human cell line models. Here, through applying our understanding of EMT cancer cell heterogeneity and markers for EMT CSCs, we have identified EMT CSCs disseminating from the primary tumour in human pathological specimens. Importantly, the presence of these disseminating stem cells is strongly correlated with tumour metastasis. Using an image-based machine learning approach, we have demonstrated the ability to predict metastasis with high accuracy through staining for EMT CSCs.</p><p>A partial EMT state has previously been identified in an OSCC scRNAseq dataset; this state retained epithelial gene expression alongside expression of mesenchymal genes, and was correlated with nodal metastasis and adverse pathological features (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Puram et al., 2017</xref>). Now, using immunofluorescent staining for EMT CSCs that retain the epithelial marker EpCAM alongside the mesenchymal marker Vimentin and the CSC plasticity marker CD24, we have identified single EMT CSCs disseminating into the stroma surrounding oral tumours. However, epithelial keratins are not retained. We have also shown that retention of EpCAM is not on its own sufficient alongside Vimentin to mark disseminating EMT CSCs that correlate with metastasis. There is a requirement for CD24, which we have previously shown to be a plasticity marker within the EMT population even when driven into full morphological EMT under TGFβ treatment (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Biddle et al., 2016</xref>). This suggests that the EMT CSC state may be more complex than a simple coalescence of epithelial and mesenchymal characteristics.</p><p>Image-based machine learning approaches employ a greater range of inputs to develop their predictions, and therefore often achieve greater predictive accuracy than machine learning approaches that use simpler data inputs. This comes at the cost of increased computing requirements and reduced ability to decode the learning process (the so-called ‘black box’), but in our study the image-based approach proved essential to achieve high predictive accuracy. The lack of improvement in predictive accuracy when trained on a collection of 9000 images compared to 3500 suggests a limitation of the ANN, and a possible role for more sophisticated neural network architectures such as convolutional neural networks (CNNs). Whereas the ANN is trained using intensity values for each pixel, a CNN uses the raw image for training. CNNs require many more images for training, but can reach higher levels of accuracy. To support the conclusions of this study, a further blinded cohort and a greater number of tumour specimens would be valuable. This may also enable the application of a CNN to the imaging data to see if it can achieve even higher predictive accuracy than that reported here.</p><p>We have shown that immunofluorescent antibody co-staining for EpCAM, Vimentin and CD24 can separate disseminating EMT CSCs from the stromal content of human tumours, a challenge which has confounded previous attempts to develop a predictive EMT signature (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Tan et al., 2014</xref>). We also show that EpCAM<sup>+</sup>Vim<sup>+</sup>CD24<sup>-</sup> tumour cells in the stroma do not correlate with metastasis, and therefore the clinically predictive utility of tumour cell staining in the stroma can be isolated specifically to the EpCAM<sup>+</sup>Vim<sup>+</sup>CD24<sup>+</sup> EMT CSCs. This highlights the value of using techniques that give single cell resolution, enabling isolation of the signal to the specific cell type of interest within a highly heterogeneous cellular environment. An important strength of our study has been the ability to look at the single cell level in an automated fashion across thousands of fields of view from human tumours, enabling us to observe and quantify human tumour cells disseminating into the surrounding tissue. This in turn enabled us to identify single disseminating EMT CSCs, and use these to train an ANN to predict metastasis.</p></sec><sec id="s4" sec-type="methods"><title>Methods</title><table-wrap

The clinical ground truth was then provided to us by the pathologists to confirm the accuracy of the predictions.</p></sec></sec></body><back><sec sec-type="additional-information" id="s5"><title>Additional information</title><fn-group content-type="competing-interest"><title>Competing interests</title><fn fn-type="COI-statement" id="conf1"><p>No competing interests declared</p></fn></fn-group><fn-group content-type="author-contribution"><title>Author contributions</title><fn fn-type="con" id="con1"><p>Conceptualization, Formal analysis, Investigation, Writing - original draft</p></fn><fn fn-type="con" id="con2"><p>Investigation, Methodology</p></fn><fn fn-type="con" id="con3"><p>Investigation, Methodology</p></fn><fn fn-type="con" id="con4"><p>Investigation, Methodology</p></fn><fn fn-type="con" id="con5"><p>Investigation, Methodology</p></fn><fn fn-type="con" id="con6"><p>Resources, Data curation, Investigation</p></fn><fn fn-type="con" id="con7"><p>Resources, Data curation</p></fn><fn fn-type="con" id="con8"><p>Conceptualization, Supervision</p></fn><fn fn-type="con" id="con9"><p>Supervision, Funding acquisition</p></fn><fn fn-type="con" id="con10"><p>Conceptualization, Supervision, Funding acquisition, Investigation, Writing - original draft, Project administration, Writing - review and editing</p></fn></fn-group><fn-group content-type="ethics-information"><title>Ethics</title><fn fn-type="other"><p>Human subjects: Archival human specimens and associated de-identified clinical data was accessed under UK HRA approval with REC ref 18/WM/0326.</p></fn></fn-group></sec><sec sec-type="supplementary-material" id="s6"><title>Additional files</title><supplementary-material id="supp1"><label>Supplementary file 1.</label><caption><title>Tumour characteristics for the 12 metastatic tumours (tumours 1–12) and 12 non-metastatic tumours (tumours 13–24) that were sectioned and stained for EpCAM, CD24 and Vimentin in the first cohort.</title></caption><media xlink:href="elife-90298-supp1-v2.docx" mimetype="application" mime-subtype="docx"/></supplementary-material><supplementary-material id="supp2"><label>Supplementary file 2.</label><caption><title>Clinical details and blinded analysis outcomes for second tumour cohort.</title></caption><media xlink:href="elife-90298-supp2-v2.docx" mimetype="application" mime-subtype="docx"/></supplementary-material><supplementary-material id="mdar"><label>MDAR checklist</label><media xlink:href="elife-90298-mdarchecklist1-v2.docx" mimetype="application" mime-subtype="docx"/></supplementary-material></sec><sec sec-type="data-availability" id="s7"><title>Data availability</title><p>There are no sequencing datasets associated with this study.

These subpopulations appear to exist within oral squamous cell carcinoma (OSCC) cell lines and within primary tissues. The paper demonstrates that CD24 expression is requisite for plasticity and suggests that the presence of CD24+/EpCAM+/VIM+ cells in the stroma of OSCC tumors may be indicative of metastasis. Some whole genome transcriptome analysis was also done to determine differences between bulk, EMT restricted and EMT stem populations. Overall, the notion that specific cells have the plasticity needed to move between epithelial and mesenchymal states is intriguing, and the presumption that these cells contribute to metastasis seems logical. However, the work is still rather preliminary. Accordingly, it is difficult to make solid conclusions regarding the prognostic utility of this state or of what may regulate it.</p><p>The study uses a very small sample size (24 patients) for the test and validation cohorts.

Only one example of the putative invading population is shown (Figure 4C) and the stromal 'infiltrative' subpopulation is adjacent to a very flat and 'pushing' tumour/stroma boundary, with no apparent budding into the stroma. This would need to be addressed with several more examples and high-magnification H&amp;E images. Furthermore, this is a major claim- namely that occult infiltrating EMT cells are commonly encountered in peritumoural stroma but can only be differentiated from somatic stroma by multiplex immunofluorescence- and it needs major evidence to back it up. What do these cells look like on H&amp;E? Are they mesenchymal in their appearances on H&amp;E? Can they be conclusively differentiated from other stromal constituents (eg myofibroblasts, plasma cells) immunohistochemically and/or morphologically? It could be that the power to predict metastatic status power is related to somatic stromal factors rather than EMT.</p><p>The AI prediction of metastatic status is compelling, but this fundamental point would need to be persuasively addressed in order to support the author's major claims.</p><p>I do not feel qualified to comment upon the AI strategies used later in the study.</p><p><italic>Reviewer #3 (General assessment and major comments (Required)):</italic></p><p>The article by Youssef G et al., focused on developing a Machine Learning system to use immunofluorescence data to detect metastatic cells in tumor stroma, which might be responsible for metastasis in case of OSCC. To detect single cell in the transition of EMT to MET they focused on EMT-Stem cells rather than only EMT phenotypes. They have shown that retention of epithelial marker EpCAM and stem cell marker CD24 and upregulation mesenchymal marker Vimentin can identify disseminating EMT stem cells in the tumor stroma. It is very well presented, well written and has high implication.</p><p>Comments to improve:</p><p>1. Strongly recommended to add the distribution of tumor status vs. proposed marker expression pattern. That is to show the distribution of EpCAM, CD24, Vimentin +/- in metastatic vs. other tumor status as mentioned in Supplementary figure 2. This might help you to establish these markers combination to follow a pattern in disease progression.</p><p>2. In all cell and tissue images add the scale.</p><p>3. For figure 3f, show enlarged picture of the single cell staining on the inset or add a separate panel to show only single cell staining.</p><p>4. Figure 4, the panel name or the font is too small to read, enlarge the font size (a, b, c, d, f).</p><p>5. Same problem with figure 6a, font size too small. In addition, in the heat maps, is it possible to add cluster names horizontally? Also for figure 6c, the cluster names are too small.</p><p>6. The EMT sub-populations are not associated with a spectrum of epithelial/mesenchymal genes expression (supplementary figure 5). The explanation is not very clear.</p><p>[Editors’ note: further revisions were suggested prior to acceptance, as described below.]</p><p>Thank you for submitting your article &quot;Disseminating cells in human oral tumours acquire an EMT cancer stem cell state that is predictive of metastasis&quot; for consideration by <italic>eLife</italic>.

The reviewer indicated that our manuscript needed further development, and detailed the areas requiring development in their comments below. We have now substantially revised our manuscript to address these comments, and will address each in turn.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>The study uses a very small sample size (24 patients) for the test and validation cohorts. The study should be expanded to use a different set of patient samples for test and validation sets. Moreover, the utility of the stem-EMT signature should be tested using multivariate analyses.</p></disp-quote><p>We initially performed this experiment using 10 samples, and saw a large difference in staining between the metastatic and non-metastatic specimens. Based on this large difference, we determined that a further 14 were required for a robust statistical analysis – this gave a total of 24 samples. We have developed a high-content multiplexed approach (a major innovation of this study), where each sample takes a significant amount of time to analyse and produces a large amount of multi-parameter data on a single cell basis (across the 24 specimens, we took 3500 imaging fields containing 2,640,000 cells into our analysis of Vimentin/EpCAM/CD24 co-staining at the tumour-stroma interface). Fields of view were randomly assigned to training and validation sets with a 70:30 split and reported outcomes are based on the validation set. With this high-content multiplexed approach, training and validation of a machine learning approach can be achieved using a relatively small number of specimens.</p><p>However, we appreciate the value of this reviewer’s request for a fully independent experimental set, and therefore we have now performed a new experiment staining 60 new specimens (30 metastatic and 30 non-metastatic) as an independent experimental set for the machine learning (Figure 3D). This set was trained and tested on a 70:30 split entirely independently from the first experimental set, and achieved very similar performance. This second set comprised over 9000 imaging fields at the tumour-stroma boundary from 60 evenly stratified tumour specimens, containing over 8.5 million nucleated cells.</p><p>The nature of the data in this experiment, with a very large number of datapoints at single cell level, does not lend itself to a multivariate analysis. Machine learning approaches have the major advantage that they can incorporate the complexity of single cell data.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>In figure 4, it looks like CD24 is positive in the bulk of tumors (regardless of stage) and in skin. Is this specific? Also, there appear to be VIMENTIN/EPCAM/CD24 positive cells in the bulk of non-metastatic tumours. Can this be seen using sequencing? Overall, the images as presented are not overly convincing.</p></disp-quote><p>CD24 on its own is not a specific marker. It is expressed in the epithelial tumour cells, in normal keratinocytes, and in a number of other cell types. Therefore, staining for CD24 would be expected in the tumour bulk and the normal epithelial layer (oral mucosa, in this case). The important advance of our immunofluorescence approach is that we have multiplexed CD24, EpCAM and Vimentin together for identification of co-localisation on a single cell basis. We have added immunofluorescence (Vimentin/EpCAM/CD24) data as a supplementary figure (Figure S1), showing that an EMT sub-population co-staining for Vimentin, CD24 and EpCAM is present in cancer culture but absent in cultured keratinocytes and fibroblasts. However, CD24 and EpCAM staining alone are both abundant in bulk tumour cells and normal keratinocytes and Vimentin is abundant in fibroblasts. It is the multiplexing of the three markers together (combined with image analysis at the single cell level) that is key, and a major innovation of our study.</p><p>In addition, we have analysed a scRNAseq dataset for head and neck cancer (Puram et al., 2017), and this showed that co-expression of Vimentin, EpCAM and CD24 in single cells is specific to a subset of tumour cells and not present in stromal cells. This data has been added to the manuscript (Figure S4).</p><p>We detected only very few Vimentin/EpCAM/CD24 co-staining cells in the body of non-metastatic tumours (quantification shown in Figure 2F). This was dwarfed by the number seen in the tumour stroma, particularly of metastatic tumours.</p><p>The comment that the images presented in figure 4 (now Figure 2) are not overly convincing agrees with more detailed comments from reviewer 2, and we will address this point in detail under reviewer 2’s comments.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>EMT stem versus restricted signatures should be validated using additional models.</p></disp-quote><p>We agree that this aspect of the manuscript was somewhat preliminary and, on reflection, detracted from the main message of the manuscript – the first identification of individual EMT CSCs disseminating from the tumour in human pathological specimens, which are predictive of metastasis. We have therefore revised our manuscript to focus on these major findings, and have removed this more preliminary work on transcriptional signatures.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Also, greater evidence is required to determine how these cell fractions may differ. Are they sitting in different epigenetic states? Can trajectories be detected in human cancers, using single cell sequencing, for example?</p></disp-quote><p>We agree that these are very interesting questions. However, we think they are outside the scope of the current study. We have revised the manuscript to make the scope and major focus of the study clearer.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Finally, do they have different metastatic potentials?</p></disp-quote><p>The differing metastatic potentials of EMT-stem and EMT-restricted sub-populations has been previously demonstrated in animal metastasis models. A requirement for sequential EMT and MET in metastasis is well-established (Tsai et al., 2012), and the ability to undergo MET to seed secondary lesions is restricted to a specific stem-like EMT sub-population in metastasis (Ocana et al., 2012; Pastushenko et al., 2018). In addition, we have previously described the differing tumour initiation potential of the EMT-stem and EMT-restricted sub-lines used in our work – EMT-stem has tumour initiation potential when transplanted orthotopically into NOD/SCID mice, and EMT-restricted does not (Biddle et al., 2016). This is on the background of a cell line where we have demonstrated that EMT drives metastasis (Biddle et al., 2011), and relates to metastatic potential as a cell must have tumour initiation potential in order to seed metastasis. These studies provide the underlying rationale for using ability to undergo MET as the criteria for identifying markers of the EMT CSCs for use in the current study.</p><p>The aim of the current study is to translate these findings into human specimens, in order that the findings of metastasis driven by EMT CSCs in experimental models can be investigated in human pathological specimens. Again, in revising the manuscript we have been careful to clarify the scope to focus on these major aims.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Reviewer #2 (General assessment and major comments (Required)):</p><p>The authors tackle the important and intractable question of the mismatch between the primacy of EMT in cell culture studies versus the rarity with which EMT is morphologically apparent in resected tumour tissues.</p><p>The early part of the study is convincing and well conducted, with identification of subpopulations of EMT cells with the ability to undergo MET, and associated marker profiles in flow cytometry.</p><p>They then develop an impressive multiplex assay for the identification of cells with the same profile in resected tumour material- a really promising approach bringing molecular findings into the context of primary tumour tissue.</p><p>The major issue that I have is in the application of this assay to tissues, and the subsequent AI analysis.

This would need to be addressed with several more examples and high-magnification H&amp;E images. Furthermore, this is a major claim- namely that occult infiltrating EMT cells are commonly encountered in peritumoural stroma but can only be differentiated from somatic stroma by multiplex immunofluorescence- and it needs major evidence to back it up. What do these cells look like on H&amp;E? Are they mesenchymal in their appearances on H&amp;E? Can they be conclusively differentiated from other stromal constituents (eg myofibroblasts, plasma cells) immunohistochemically and/or morphologically? It could be that the power to predict metastatic status power is related to somatic stromal factors rather than EMT.</p></disp-quote><p>We are very pleased that this reviewer has noted both the importance of our research question and the promise of our approach. They also note that our experiments focusing on EMT CSC marker identification and AI prediction of metastasis are compelling. This reviewer notes the single major concern, also noted by reviewer 1, that the images in figure 4 (now figure 2) are not sufficient to support our major finding that occult infiltrating EMT cells are present in human tumours and can be differentiated from somatic stroma using multiplexed EMT CSC markers. We fully appreciate this concern, and agree that a greater range of images in the revised manuscript, along with clarification of some specific points, is required. Specifically:</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Only one example of the putative invading population is shown (Figure 4C) and the stromal ‘infiltrative’ subpopulation is adjacent to a very flat and ‘pushing’ tumour/stroma boundary, with no apparent budding into the stroma.

We chose the image in Figure 4C (now Figure 2C) because the flat boundary is clearly identifiable as a boundary to a broad, non-specialist audience. However, we agree that we need to present more images, and we have now included more examples with different boundary presentations (Figure 2G and Figure S3).</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>What do these cells look like on H&amp;E?

In support of this conclusion, we can make a couple of observations based on the data already included. (1) There is no co-staining in the stroma of normal mucosal regions that are distant from the tumour. (2) Our use of EpCAM as a tumour lineage marker is specifically intended to exclude staining for stromal constituents. EpCAM is a specific epithelial marker, that is not expressed in stromal or immune cells – it is expressed exclusively in epithelia and epithelial-derived tumours (Keller et al., 2019), and we have made this point more clearly in the revised manuscript. Contrastingly, CD24 is quite widely expressed, and Vimentin is expressed by stromal fibroblasts. They are only specific to the EMT CSCs when multiplexed together with EpCAM.</p><p>Analysis of H&amp;Es proved challenging, as the immunostained sections are often several sections away from the H&amp;Es. This can mean that there is up to 100µm between them and, whilst the broad structures are preserved, the individual cells are different. Due to this, we were unable to identify the triple-stained cells in the H&amp;Es. Instead, to further test the conclusion that we are staining infiltrating tumour cells and not stromal constituents, we analysed a published scRNAseq dataset for head and neck cancer (Puram et al., 2017). This showed that co-expression of Vimentin, EpCAM and CD24 in single cells is specific a subset of tumour cells and not present in stromal cells. This data has been added to the manuscript (Figure S4). This strengthens our conclusion that we are staining infiltrating tumour cells and not stromal constituents.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>The AI prediction of metastatic status is compelling, but this fundamental point would need to be persuasively addressed in order to support the author's major claims.</p><p>I do not feel qualified to comment upon the AI strategies used later in the study.</p><p>Reviewer #3 (General assessment and major comments (Required)):</p><p>The article by Youssef G et al., focused on developing a Machine Learning system to use immunofluorescence data to detect metastatic cells in tumor stroma, which might be responsible for metastasis in case of OSCC. To detect single cell in the transition of EMT to MET they focused on EMT-Stem cells rather than only EMT phenotypes. They have shown that retention of epithelial marker EpCAM and stem cell marker CD24 and upregulation mesenchymal marker Vimentin can identify disseminating EMT stem cells in the tumor stroma. It is very well presented, well written and has high implication.</p></disp-quote><p>We are grateful for this reviewer’s very positive comments on both the importance and presentation of our study, as well as their useful suggestions for improving the manuscript.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Comments to improve:</p><p>1. Strongly recommended to add the distribution of tumor status vs. proposed marker expression pattern.

This might help you to establish these markers combination to follow a pattern in disease progression.</p></disp-quote><p>The nature of the data in this experiment, with a very large number of datapoints at single cell level, does not lend itself to a multivariate analysis.

This blinded analysis is now described in the paper; it involved using the ANN trained using the first cohort to predict the metastatic status of the second cohort with the researchers blinded, prior to provision of clinical data by the pathologist. In the original revised manuscript, we omitted this analysis as we thought it better to treat the two cohorts separately.
