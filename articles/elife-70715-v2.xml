FBXO45 is an E3 ubiquitin ligase that is frequently elevated expression in human HCC. However, it remains unknown whether FBXO45 is associated with hepatocarcinogenesis and how to treat HCC patients with high FBXO45 expression. Here, IHC and qPCR analysis revealed that FBXO45 protein and mRNA were highly expressed in 54.3% (57 of 105) and 52.2% (132 of 253) of the HCC tissue samples, respectively. Highly expressed FBXO45 promoted liver tumorigenesis in transgenic mice. Mechanistically, FBXO45 promoted IGF2BP1 ubiquitination at the Lys190 and Lys450 sites and subsequent activation, leading to the upregulation of PLK1 expression and the induction of cell proliferation and liver tumorigenesis in vitro and in vivo. PLK1 inhibition or IGF2BP1 knockdown significantly blocked FBXO45-driven liver tumorigenesis in FBXO45 transgenic mice, primary cells, and HCCs. Furthermore, IHC analysis on HCC tissue samples revealed a positive association between the hyperexpression of FBXO45 and PLK1/IGF2BP1, and both had positive relationship with poor survival in HCC patients. Thus, FBXO45 plays an important role in promoting liver tumorigenesis through IGF2BP1 ubiquitination and activation, and subsequent PLK1 upregulation, suggesting a new strategy for treating HCC by targeting FBXO45/IGF2BP1/PLK1 axis.</p></abstract><kwd-group kwd-group-type="author-keywords"><kwd>ubiquitination</kwd><kwd>HCC</kwd><kwd>tumorigenesis</kwd><kwd>FBXO45</kwd><kwd>PLK1</kwd><kwd>IGF2BP1</kwd></kwd-group><kwd-group kwd-group-type="research-organism"><title>Research organism</title><kwd>Ubiquitination</kwd><kwd>HCC</kwd><kwd>Over survival</kwd><kwd>Tumorigenesis</kwd><kwd>Targeted therapy</kwd><kwd>FBXO45</kwd><kwd>PLK1</kwd><kwd>IGF2BP1</kwd></kwd-group><funding-group><award-group id="fund1"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution>Third Military Medical University</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>4174C6</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Xie</surname><given-names>Chuan-Ming</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund2"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100001809</institution-id><institution>National Natural Science Foundation of China</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>32071294</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Xie</surname><given-names>Chuan-Ming</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><funding-statement>The funders had no role in study design, data collection and interpretation, or the decision to submit the work for publication.</funding-statement></funding-group><custom-meta-group><custom-meta specific-use="meta-only"><meta-name>Author impact statement</meta-name><meta-value>Using IGF2BP1-PLK1 axis as an example, targeting oncogenic signaling represents a direction treatment for HCC patients with high FBXO45 expression.</meta-value></custom-meta></custom-meta-group></article-meta></front><body><sec id="s1" sec-type="intro"><title>Introduction</title><p>Hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) is a highly aggressive primary liver malignancy. HCC treatment strategy is based on tumor staging. Staging system such as TNM (tumor-node-metastasis) staging has been proposed for HCC, where T represents the characteristics of the primary tumor, N describes the presence or absence of spread to certain lymph nodes, and M details whether the tumor has distant metastasis in the body. According to the eighth American Joint Committee on Cancer (AJCC) TNM Staging for HCC, T1 (solitary tumor ≤2 cm; solitary tumor &gt;2 cm without vascular invasion), T2 (solitary tumor &gt;2 cm with vascular invasion; or multiple tumors, none &gt;5 cm), T3 (multiple tumors, at least one of which is &gt;5 cm), and T4 (single tumor or multiple tumors of any size involving a major branch of the portal vein or hepatic vein, or tumor(s) with direct invasion of adjacent organs other than the gallbladder or with perforation of visceral peritoneum) were differentiated. With these descriptors, stages I, II, III, and IV were defined as T1 N0 M0, T2 N0 M0, T3 N0 M0, and T4 N0 M0 or any T N1 M0 or any T Any N M1, respectively.</p><p>Although treatment strategies against HCC have developed in recent years, such as the application of molecule-targeted drug, yet it is still one of the leading causes of cancer-related mortality worldwide. Currently, around 60% of HCC patients are diagnosed at advanced stages of carcinogenesis, consequently not able to receive potentially curative treatments (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Altekruse et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Cucchetti et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Kanwal and Singal, 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Llovet et al., 2019</xref>). The pathogenesis of HCC is poorly understood. Therefore, more efforts should be devoted to investigating the molecular mechanisms of HCC tumorigenesis and development. Mounting evidence shows that HCC is a stepwise process, as HCC is a heterogeneous disease driven by the serial accumulation of mutations in tumor suppressor genes (such as <italic>TP53, PTEN,</italic> and <italic>RB</italic>) and proto-oncogenes (such as <italic>MYC, MET, BRAF,</italic> and <italic>RAS</italic>)(<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">Zhang et al., 2020</xref>). Thus, it is especially important to expound the possible molecular mechanisms underlying the development of HCC.</p><p>Ubiquitination is a posttranslational modification that can affect protein localization and regulate cell cycle progression, apoptosis, and transcriptional activity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Teixeira and Reed, 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">DiAntonio et al., 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Meyer-Schwesinger, 2019</xref>). The ubiquitin-proteasome system (UPS) is initiated by the conjugation of ubiquitin (a 76-amino acid polypeptide) to a substrate protein, which involves enzymes in three distinct classes of enzymes, a ubiquitin-activating enzyme (E1), ubiquitin-conjugating enzyme (E2), and ubiquitin ligase (E3)(<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Micel et al., 2013</xref>). E3 ubiquitin-protein ligases are critical in the UPS for the selectivity needed to target specific proteins for degradation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Deshaies and Joazeiro, 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Nakayama and Nakayama, 2006</xref>). Increased evidence has indicated that HCC is associated with abnormal regulation of E3 ubiquitin ligases (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Shen et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Li et al., 2014</xref>). F-box protein is the substrate recognizing subunit of SCF (SKP1, CUL1, and F-box protein) E3 ubiquitin ligase complexes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Chen et al., 2014</xref>) and plays important roles in cancer development and progression via regulation of the expression and activity of oncogenes and tumor suppressor genes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Randle and Laman, 2016</xref>).</p><p>F-box/SPRY domain-containing protein 1 (FBXO45) is an atypical E3 ubiquitin ligase (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Saiga et al., 2009</xref>). FBXO45 promotes ubiquitin-dependent proteolysis of some key molecules governing cell survival or DNA damage, in which include FBXW7 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Richter et al., 2020</xref>), PAR4 (prostate apoptosis response protein 4) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Chen et al., 2014</xref>), p73 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Peschiaroli et al., 2009</xref>), and ZEB1 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Wu et al., 2019</xref>) and it can also block the proteolysis of some proteins, including N-cadherin (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Chung et al., 2014</xref>). Previous studies mainly investigated the role of FBXO45 in cell fate at the cell line level or clinical outcomes in human cancer tissues. Recently, IHC staining showed that nearly 54.2% of HCC patients had high FBXO45 expression in HCC tissues compared with adjacent normal tissues. It is not yet known whether FBXO45 is related to HCC tumorigenesis in vivo or if it has clinical significance in HCC.</p><p>Insulin-like growth factor 2 mRNA-binding protein 1 (IGF2BP1) is an oncogenic protein expressed in various cancers, including HCC. For example, IGF2BP1 affects the proliferation and tumorigenic potential of leukemia cells through the critical regulators of self-renewal HOXB4 and MYB and the aldehyde dehydrogenase ALDH1A1 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Elcheva et al., 2019</xref>). IGF2BP1 increases melanoma metastasis via extracellular vesicle-mediated promotion (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Ghoshal et al., 2019</xref>). IGF2BP1 enhances the expression of various serum response factor (SRF) target genes, including <italic>PDLIM7, FOXK1, MKI67,</italic> and <italic>MYC</italic>, and promotes tumor cell growth and invasion in HCC and other cancers (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Gutschner et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Müller et al., 2018</xref>). However, a few recent studies found that suppressive roles for IGF2BP1 in tumor growth and metastasis in breast cancer and colon cancer (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">Wang et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Hamilton et al., 2015</xref>).</p><p>Here, hyperexpression of FBXO45 was correlated with poor prognosis in HCC. Furthermore, FBXO45 significantly promoted HCC tumorigenesis in FBXO45-OE (OE as over-expressed) mice. Mechanistically, FBXO45 specifically bound to IGF2BP1 and promoted its ubiquitination and activation, followed by upregulation of PLK1. IGF2BP1 was identified as a novel substrate of FBXO45. Targeting IGF2BP1-PLK1 signaling significantly attenuated HCC tumorigenesis triggered by FBXO45. These data uncovered an important role of FBXO45 in regulating HCC tumorigenesis through activation of IGF2BP1-mediated protumorigenic signaling PLK1, suggesting a new strategy for HCC therapy by targeting IGF2BP1-PLK1 axis in HCC patients exhibiting high FBXO45 expression.</p></sec><sec id="s2" sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><sec id="s2-1"><title>FBXO45 is associated with poor survival in HCC patients</title><p>To determine the role of FBXO45 in human HCC, the protein expression of FBXO45 in a cohort of 105 paired human HCC and adjacent noncancerous liver tissue specimens were examined.

This high expression of FBXO45 localized to HCC cells but not hepatic stellate cells (HSCs; identified by alpha-smooth muscle actin [α-SMA], a well-established marker of HSCs in the fibrotic liver) or fibrotic cells (Sirius red signal, an indicator of fibrotic cells), implying that the expression of FBXO45 was restricted to HCC cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1A–B</xref>).

hepatocarcinogenesis in vivo was addressed. To achieve this, a mouse model with FBXO45 hyperexpression (FBXO45-OE) was generated and injected intraperitoneally with DEN/CCl<sub>4</sub> to promote hepatocarcinogenesis and shorten the observation period. DNA and protein were isolated from liver tissues of FBXO45-OE and wild-type (WT) mice.

FBXO45, upon ectopic expression in HCCLM3 or HepG2 cells, pulled down endogenous IGF2BP1 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3B</xref>). Reciprocally, endogenous IGF2BP1 pulled down ectopically expressed FBXO45 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3C</xref>). Significantly, WT FBXO45, but not its F-box domain-deleted mutant(FBXO45ΔF), pulled down IGF2BP1 in both HepG2 and HCCLM3 cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3D</xref>), while both WT FBXO45 and FBXO45ΔF pulled down N-cadherin (a FBXO45 target protein binding the Sprouty domain) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Chung et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s1">Figure 3—figure supplement 1A</xref>), suggesting that IGF2BP1 interacted with FBXO45 at the F-box domain. In addition, FBXO45 and IGF2BP1 were co-localized in cytoplasm, which further supports the binding of these two proteins (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s1">Figure 3—figure supplement 1B</xref>). Based on the analysis of the ubiquitome shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3A</xref>, we found that IGF2BP1 in HCC exhibited the upregulated ubiquitination at Lys190 and Lys450. However, it is still unclear whether the oncogenic activity of IGF2BP1 is related to its ubiquitination. Here, these two sites were evolutionarily conserved among different species (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s1">Figure 3—figure supplement 1C</xref>). Next, whether FBXO45 promoted IGF2BP1 ubiquitination was evaluated. As shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3E</xref>, FBXO45 enhanced IGF2BP1 polyubiquitination, while the K190A or K450A mutants significantly blocked this action. To characterize the type of ubiquitin chains involved in FBXO45-mediated IGF2BP1 polyubiquitination, two ubiquitin mutants (K48R and K63R) were used along with the WT ubiquitin. The in vivo ubiquitination assay indicated that a K63R ubiquitin mutant significantly attenuated the formation of polyubiquitin chain to IGF2BP1 compared with both WT and a K48R mutant form of ubiquitin (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3F</xref>). In line with this finding, K48 ubiquitin attenuated IGF2BP1 polyubiquitination compared with K63 and WT ubiquitin (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s1">Figure 3—figure supplement 1D</xref>), which further confirmed that FBXO45 promoted K63-linked polyubiquitination of IGF2BP1. FBXO45 formed a complex with the E3 ubiquitin ligase PAM (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Richter et al., 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Saiga et al., 2009</xref>). In order to know whether the ubiquitylation of IGF2BP1 was dependent on PAM activity, ubiquitination assay was performed to investigate the effect of PAM knockdown on IGF2BP ubiquitination. As shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s2">Figure 3—figure supplement 2A</xref>, knockdown of PAM could significantly block FBXO45-mediated IGF2BP1 ubiquitination. Furthermore, IGF2BP1 interacted with SKP1 but not cullin-1 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s2">Figure 3—figure supplement 2B</xref>). Taken together, FBXO45-PAM-SKP1 promoted K63-linked ubiquitination of IGF2BP1.</p><p>In addition, MG132, an inhibitor of proteasome, did not significantly increase IGF2BP1 protein level compared with FBXO45-overexpressed alone group, indicating that FBXO45 doesn’t mediate IGF2BP1 proteasome-dependent degradation in HCCs (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3G</xref>). In order to validate whether FBXO45 increased IGF2BP1 activity via polyubiquitination at K190 and K450, the effect of FBXO45 and its mutants on cell proliferation was analyzed by CCK-8 assay. WT IGF2BP1 dramatically promoted HCC proliferation, whereas K190A and K450A mutants attenuated its oncogenic activity (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3H</xref>). In line with this finding, FBXO45 promoted WT IGF2BP1-mediated cell proliferation much stronger than two IGF2BP1 mutants (K190A and K450A) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3I</xref>). Taken together, the ubiquitination of IGF2BP1 at K190 and K450 was positively related to its oncogenic activity, which was mediated by FBXO45.</p></sec><sec id="s2-4"><title>FBXO45 promotes cell proliferation via IGF2BP1-PLK1 axis</title><p>The RNA-binding protein IGF2BP1 is an important protumorigenic factor in liver carcinogenesis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Gutschner et al., 2014</xref>).

Research evidence has indicated a close link between abnormal expression of E3 ubiquitin ligases and HCC (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Shen et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Li et al., 2014</xref>). Recent studies have reported that FBXO45 may play key roles in the tumorigenesis and prognosis of squamous cell lung carcinoma and colorectal cancer (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">Wang et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Wu et al., 2019</xref>). However, it is still unknown whether FBXO45 promotes HCC tumorigenesis in vivo and the underlying mechanism is also unclear. Here, the data showed that (1) FBXO45 functioned as an oncogene by promoting HCC tumorigenesis in vivo. (2) FBXO45 protein expression in HCC tissue was increased and significantly associated with poor survival in HCC patients. (3) Multivariate analysis revealed that FBXO45 was an independent risk factor for patient survival. (4) FBXO45 promoted HCC tumorigenesis via IGF2BP1 polyubiquitination and activation. (5) Targeting IGF2BP1-PLK1 axis protected against HCC tumorigenesis triggered by elevated expression of FBXO45 in vitro and in vivo. Our findings elucidated the oncogenic role of FBXO45 in HCC tumorigenesis as well as the mechanism underlying this process. Targeting IGF2BP1-PLK1 axis might represent a novel therapeutic strategy for the treatment of human HCC with high FBXO45 expression.</p><p>In addition to the role of FBXO45 in the regulation of emotional expression (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Shimanoe et al., 2019</xref>), recent studies have demonstrated that FBXO45 binds specifically to the tumor suppressor PAR4 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Chen et al., 2014</xref>), transcription factor p73 (a member of the p53 family) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Peschiaroli et al., 2009</xref>), and FBXW7 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Richter et al., 2020</xref>), triggering ubiquitin-mediated proteolysis and regulating cell survival. Conversely, elevated expression of FBXO45 results in decreased proteolysis of N-cadherin and promotion of neuronal differentiation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Chung et al., 2014</xref>). In contrast to these previous studies, these genes were not involved in FBXO45-triggered HCC, as indicated by analysis of the ubiquitin sites and FBXO45-binding proteins (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3A</xref>). Our data suggested that FBXO45 specifically bound to IGF2BP1 and promoted its polyubiquitination and activation in HCC. IGF2BP1, an oncogene, was one of the strongly upregulated RNA-binding proteins among 116 proteins identified in HCC tissue compared with normal liver tissue (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Gutschner et al., 2014</xref>). At the molecular level, IGF2BP1 bound to and stabilized the mRNA transcripts and increased the protein expression of MYC and KI67, two potent regulators of cell proliferation and apoptosis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Gutschner et al., 2014</xref>). In addition, several IGF2BP1 target genes were identified, including <italic>PDLIM7</italic>, F<italic>OXK1</italic>, <italic>PLK1</italic>, and <italic>ATG5</italic>, some of which were validated in previous studies (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Müller et al., 2019</xref>). Here, IGF2BP1 significantly upregulated the transcription of PLK1 and KI67 (two proteins related to cell proliferation) compared with that of other genes in HCCLM3 and HepG2 cells. Furthermore, FBXO45 increased the expression of these two proteins, and silencing IGF2BP1 blocked this effect in vitro and in vivo, indicating the promotive effect of the FBXO45-IGF2BP1-PLK1 axis on hepatocarcinogenesis.</p><p>IGF2BP1 is a known essential regulator of intestinal development and cancer. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Chatterji et al., 2019</xref>. reported increased IGF2BP1 expression in patients with Crohn’s disease or ulcerative colitis.

However, it remains unknown whether the oncogenic activity of IGF2BP1 is related to its ubiquitination. Here, an ubiquitome study indicated that FBXO45 promoted IGF2BP1 polyubiquitination at K190 and K450. An ubiquitination assay demonstrated that mutation of K190 or K450 could significantly block the FBXO45-mediated polyubiquitination of IGF2BP1, reduce IGF2BP1 activity and inhibit cell proliferation. Therefore, the ubiquitination of IGF2BP1 at K190 and K450 is positively related to its activity in hepatocarcinogenesis.</p><p>In summary, FBXO45 played an important role in promoting hepatocarcinogenesis in vitro and in vivo. There was a positive correlation between increased FBXO45 and IGF2BP1 expression in HCC tissue, and these two proteins were associated with poor survival in patients with HCC. Targeting IGF2BP1-PLK1 axis may be a novel approach for treating HCC exhibiting high FBXO45 expression.</p></sec><sec id="s4" sec-type="materials|methods"><title>Materials and methods</title><sec id="s4-1"><title>Human subjects</title><p>In total, 105 human HCC and paired adjacent paraffin tissue specimens were obtained from the Department of Hepatobiliary Surgery, Southwest Hospital, Chongqing, PR China.

The samples were subsequently subjected to LC-MS/MS analysis. The tryptic peptides were dissolved in 0.1% formic acid (solvent A), directly loaded onto a home-made reversed-phase analytical column (15 cm length, 75 μm i.d.). The gradient was comprised of an increase from 6% to 23% solvent B (0.1% formic acid in 98% acetonitrile) over 26 min, 23% to 35% in 8 min and climbing to 80% in 3 min then holding at 80% for the last 3 min, all at a constant flow rate of 400 nl/min on an EASY-nLC 1000 UPLC system. The peptides were subjected to NSI source followed by tandem mass spectrometry (MS/MS) in Q ExactiveTM Plus (Thermo Fisher Scientific) coupled online to the UPLC. The electrospray voltage applied was 2.0 kV. The m/z scan range was 350–1800 for full scan, and intact peptides were detected in the Orbitrap at a resolution of 70,000. Peptides were then selected for MS/MS using NCE setting as 28 and the fragments were detected in the Orbitrap at a resolution of 17,500.

liver tumorigenesis through enhancing IGF2BP1 ubiquitination and subsequent PLK1 upregulation&quot; for consideration by <italic>eLife</italic>. Your article has been reviewed by 2 peer reviewers, and the evaluation has been overseen by a Reviewing Editor and Wafik El-Deiry as the Senior Editor. The reviewers have opted to remain anonymous.</p><p>The reviewers have discussed their reviews with one another, and the Reviewing Editor has drafted this to help you prepare a revised submission.</p><p>Essential revisions:</p><p>The authors need to address the below raised concerns:</p><p>1. The overexpression of FBXO45 in the liver needs to be demonstrated at the protein level and evaluated in respect to impact independent of DEN/CCl4 treatment.</p><p>2. The analysis of liver tissue (Figure 2) need further specification. Were the analyses performed on tumor tissue or non-malignant liver tissue. How was tumor content considered?</p><p>3. The analyses of FBXO45 overexpression/depletion in liver cancer cell models remain puzzling. The DepMap portal clearly indicates a median positive essentiality score for FBXO45 in liver and other cancer cells (specifically in HepG2!). The authors report the opposite here based on overexpression and a single depletion without convincing control of depletion efficiency – barely any depletion is seen in Figure S2C. Here deletion studies and comparison with DepMap reported data is required.</p><p>4. The data on the ubiquitination of IGf2BP1 need further in detail evaluation and consideration. In Biogrid, ubiquitination of at least 35 lysine residues, incl. the here proposed have been reported. However, no association has been reported for FBXO45, but other E3 ubiquitin ligases. Although the data appear convincing, how can the data exclude additional/other lysine residues to be modified. Moreover, the authors need to evaluate the quantity of ubiquitinated IGF2BP1 to conclusively demonstrate if this modification could contribute substantially. Along these lines, the authors need to investigate how the modification of lysine residues influences IGF2BP1-controlled mRNA turnover/translation and/or RNA-association.</p><p>5. Although PLK1 likely is a target mRNA stabilized by IGF2BP1, the data presented in Figure 4C-E are only partially convincing. The steady state mRNA levels of PLK1 are only reduced by ~20%, whereas the protein content suggests a substantially more pronounced downregulation. Moreover, in one cell line FOXK1 is down- whereas it is upregulated in the other cell line upon IGF2BP1 depletion. Finally, the decay analyses (Figure 4E) require more time points, semi-logarithmic data presentation and the error bars are unlikely to result from biological but rather technical replicates. Additional positive and negative controls are required here. Finally, establishing IGF2BP1-dependent regulation of PLK1 expression requires investigation of IGF2BP1-PLK1 mRNA association and need to include studies on how IGF2BP1 depletion impairs PLK1-directed phosphorylation.</p><p>6. Figure 4F does not show a dramatic attenuation of FBXO45-promoted cell proliferation. Instead, it only demonstrates that IGF2BP1 depletion results in modestly reduced proliferation in both, wild type as well as FBXO45-overexpressing cells. How does depletion affect FBXO45 expression?</p><p>7. Analyses of PLK1 inhibition do not provide any useful insights. Here it needs to be demonstrated that IGF2BP1 deletion and FBXO45 overexpression modulate the potency of the respective inhibitors and that this is connected to IGF2BP1 ubiquitination.</p><p>8. Results presented in Figure 5 provide interesting hints for a role of IGF2BP1 in promoting HCC, as previously reported, and regulation of PLK1 expression, but they fail to demonstrate that this is linked to FBXO45. Why is FBXO45 expression not monitored here by Western blotting?</p><p>9. Data shown in Figure 6 only prove that PLK1 inhibition impairs tumor growth irrespective of FBXO45, IGF2BP1 or IGF2BP1 ubiquitination. How would this provide any new insights?</p><p>10. The model presented in Figure 7G provides a promising hypothesis, but the presented studies fail in conclusively supporting this ubiquitination-dependent stimulation of pro-oncogenic roles of IGF2BP1.</p><p>11. The authors should analyze whether Skp1 and Cullin1 are required for the ubiquitylation of IGF2BP1; for instance, by using a Cullin-1 dominant negative and/or a NEDD8ylation inhibitor.</p><p>12. In the experiments presented here, the authors show that an FBXO45 mutant lacking its F-box is unable to bind IGF2BP1. In contrast, most F-box protein substrates would not be affected by this deletion. Does this mean that IGF2BP1 interacts with FBXO45 at the F-box domain and not the Sprouty domain? Known substrates of SCF FBXO45 could be used as a controls for these experiments.</p><p>13. Another possibility is that FBXO45 forms a complex with the E3 ubiquitin ligase PAM, as previously shown by Saiga et al. 2020. In this case, have the authors looked whether the ubiquitylation of IGF2BP1 is dependent on PAM activity? Have the authors attempted to reconstitute this complex in vitro and undertake in vitro ubiquitylation experiments?</p><p>14. The composition and architecture of the ubiquitin chain should also be studied in more detail. The evidence provided here suggests that IGF2BP1 K190/450 sited are ubiquitylated with K63 linked chains; however, additional experiments would be required. This could include sensitivity of the ubiquitin chain to different recombinant DUBs with pan, K48, or K63 activity.</p><p>15. The authors report on a novel mouse strain that over-expresses FBXO45; however, it has not been shown whether this strain produces higher protein levels. The authors should analyze FBXO45 levels in different tissues. It is also unclear whether higher FBXO45 protein levels would translate into more active FBXO45. How is the activity of this protein regulated in cells?</p><p>16. Mass spectrometry raw data should be made available.</p></body></sub-article><sub-article article-type="reply" id="sa2"><front-stub><article-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.70715.sa2</article-id><title-group><article-title>Author response</article-title></title-group></front-stub><body><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Essential revisions:</p><p>The authors need to address the below raised concerns:</p><p>1.

We have added the protein expression level of FBXO45 in the liver tissues independent on DEN/CCl4 treatment in the revised manuscript (New data shown in Figure 2—figure supplement 1B). The result indicated that FBXO45 is highly expressed in liver in FBXO45-OE mice compared with wild type mice. In addition, FBXO45 mainly high expressed in liver compared with other tissues. Furthermore, we observed FBXO45-OE mice for up to 350 days in the absence of tumor promoters (e.g. DEN and CCl4) and found that FBXO45 significantly promoted liver fibrosis and upregulated fibrotic markers compared to wild-type mice (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="sa2fig1">Author response image 1A-C</xref>). As hepatocarcinogenesis is a complex process involving chronic liver injury, inflammation, subsequent fibrosis and carcinogenesis, it makes sense that FBXO45 may induce liver tumorigenesis in the longer-term. Here, we used DEN/CCl4 treatment just to shorten observation period. In this study, under tumor promotes DEN and CCl4 condition, FBXO45 significantly promoted liver fibrosis and hepatocarcinogenesis compared with wild-type mice.</p><fig id="sa2fig1" position="float"><label>Author response image 1.</label><graphic mime-subtype="tiff" mimetype="image" xlink:href="elife-70715-sa2-fig1-v2.tif"/></fig><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>2.

Here, we identified the whole ubiquitinated proteins by ubiquitome using FBXO45 tumors and normal tissues(data shown in Figure 3A). We found that IGF2BP1 only exhibited the upregulated ubiquitination at Lys190 and Lys450 sites in FBXO45 overexpression tumors compared with normal tissues. Next, we wanted to know whether these two sites were involved in FBXO45-mediated IGF2BP1 polyubiquitination. Our results indicated FBXO45 enhanced IGF2BP1 polyubiquitination, while the K190A or K450A mutants significantly blocked this action (Figure 3E), suggesting that K190 and K450 are responsible for FBXO45-mediated IGF2BP1 polyubiquitination. Furthermore, we found that combination of the ubiquitination level of K190A and K450A groups is similar to total ubiquitination level of IGF2BP1, which further supported that FBXO45 promoted IGF2BP1 ubiquitination at K190 and K450 sites.</p><p>RIP-PCR analysis indicated that IGF2BP1 interacted with <italic>PLK1</italic> mRNA in both HepG2 and HCCLM3 cells (New data shown in Figure 4E and Figure 4—figure supplement 1A).

Taken together, these results demonstrated that IGF2BP1 bound <italic>PLK1</italic> mRNA and promoted <italic>PLK1</italic> mRNA stability. As the ubiquitination of IGF2BP1 at K190 and K450 sites related to its activity(Figure 3H), we can draw a conclusion that FBXO45 promoted IGF2BP1 polyubiquitination at K190 and K450 sites, which enhanced its binding with <italic>PLK1</italic> mRNA and promoted <italic>PLK1</italic> mRNA stability.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>5.

Moreover, in one cell line FOXK1 is down – whereas it is upregulated in the other cell line upon IGF2BP1 depletion. Finally, the decay analyses (Figure 4E) require more time points, semi-logarithmic data presentation and the error bars are unlikely to result from biological but rather technical replicates. Additional positive and negative controls are required here. Finally, establishing IGF2BP1-dependent regulation of PLK1 expression requires investigation of IGF2BP1-PLK1 mRNA association and need to include studies on how IGF2BP1 depletion impairs PLK1-directed phosphorylation.</p></disp-quote><p>Thanks for this Reviewer’s suggestion. In order to enhance the knockdown efficiency of IGF2BP1, we have used lentivirus-mediated shRNA to knockdown IGF2BP1 expression in both HCCLM3 and HepG2 cells. The new data shown in Figure 4C-D have demonstrated that IGF2BP1 silencing significantly inhibited the expression of IGF2BP1, PLK1 and, KI67 at mRNA and protein levels in both HepG2 and HCCLM3 cells. The results are consistent in these two cells.</p><p>As for the decay analyses (Figure 4E in the original version), we have followed up this Reviewer’s suggestion and added more time points, repeated more than 3 times and added a positive control (<italic>PEG10</italic>, a well-known target mRNA stabilized by IGF2BP1) and a negative control (<italic>β-actin</italic>) (Zhang et al. Theranostics, 2021).

Figure 4F does not show a dramatic attenuation of FBXO45-promoted cell proliferation. Instead, it only demonstrates that IGF2BP1 depletion results in modestly reduced proliferation in both, wild type as well as FBXO45-overexpressing cells. How does depletion affect FBXO45 expression?</p></disp-quote><p>Maybe the siRNA targeting IGF2BP1 used in the previous version was not strong. Here we have used shIGF2BP1 lentivirus against IGF2BP1 expression in primary hepatocytes. As new data shown in Figure 4D of the revised manuscript, knockdown of IGF2BP1 by lentivirus could significantly reduce IGF2BP1 expression. We found that knockdown of IGF2BP1 by shIGF2BP1 dramatically reduced cell proliferation in both wild type and FBXO45-overexpressing cells (New data shown in Figure 4G of the revised manuscript). The data presented in Figure 4G are convincing.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>7. Analyses of PLK1 inhibition do not provide any useful insights. Here it needs to be demonstrated that IGF2BP1 deletion and FBXO45 overexpression modulate the potency of the respective inhibitors and that this is connected to IGF2BP1 ubiquitination.</p></disp-quote><p>We found that FBXO45 upregulated PLK1 accumulation in HCCLM3 cells and knockdown of IGF2BP1 attenuated this action, suggesting FBXO45 increased PLK1 expression via IGF2BP1 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="sa2fig4">Author response image 4</xref>).

Results presented in Figure 5 provide interesting hints for a role of IGF2BP1 in promoting HCC, as previously reported, and regulation of PLK1 expression, but they fail to demonstrate that this is linked to FBXO45. Why is FBXO45 expression not monitored here by Western blotting?</p></disp-quote><p>We have followed up this reviewer’s constructive suggestion and added the expression of FBXO45 in Figure 5D of the revised manuscript.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>9. Data shown in Figure 6 only prove that PLK1 inhibition impairs tumor growth irrespective of FBXO45, IGF2BP1 or IGF2BP1 ubiquitination. How would this provide any new insights?</p></disp-quote><p>As shown in Figure 6, FBXO45 overexpression enhanced tumor growth and this effect could be significantly attenuated by PLK1 inhibitor, suggesting inhibition of PLK1 could be a potential target for HCC patients with FBXO45 high expression. Our previous data have demonstrated that FBXO45 upregulated PLK1 expression via IGF2BP1 ubiquitination and activation (Data shown in Figure 3E-I and Figure 4C-D).</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>10. The model presented in Figure 7G provides a promising hypothesis, but the presented studies fail in conclusively supporting this ubiquitination-dependent stimulation of pro-oncogenic roles of IGF2BP1.</p></disp-quote><p>Our pervious data showed that FBXO45 promoted wild-type IGF2BP1 ubiquitination and activation(Figure 3E-F and Figure 3—figure supplement 1D), as indicated by low pro-oncogenic role of IGF2BP1 with K190 and K450 mutants on cell proliferation compared with wild-type IGF2BP1 (Figure 3H). In addition, K63-linked ubiquitination is usually related to protein activation or stability. Here, we found that FBXO45 mediated K63-linked polyubiquitination of IGF2BP1 and then activation(Figure 3F). Our data support ubiquitination-dependent stimulation of pro-oncogenic roles of IGF2BP1.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>11. The authors should analyze whether Skp1 and Cullin1 are required for the ubiquitylation of IGF2BP1; for instance, by using a Cullin-1 dominant negative and/or a NEDD8ylation inhibitor.</p></disp-quote><p>Many E3 ubiquitin ligases contain a Cullin scaffolding protein, a Skp adaptor protein, and an F-box protein. However, FBXO45 acts as an atypical E3 ubiquitin ligase, which contains Skp1 but lacks a Cullin (Saiga et al. Mol Cell Biol 2009; Brace et al. J neurosic 2014). Consistently, according to the immunoprecipitation (IP)-MS results, FBXO45, upon ectopic expression in HCCLM3 cells, pulled down endogenous SKP1 but without Cullin-1. In line with this finding, our new data shown in Figure 3—figure supplement 2B demonstrates that FBXO45 binds to SKP1 but not endogenous Cullin-1. These results indicated FBXO45-mediated IGF2BP1 ubiquitylation requires Skp1 but not requires Cullin-1.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>12. In the experiments presented here, the authors show that an FBXO45 mutant lacking its F-box is unable to bind IGF2BP1. In contrast, most F-box protein substrates would not be affected by this deletion. Does this mean that IGF2BP1 interacts with FBXO45 at the F-box domain and not the Sprouty domain? Known substrates of SCF FBXO45 could be used as a controls for these experiments.</p></disp-quote><p>Here we have chosen N-cadherin (a FBXO45 target protein binding at the Sprouty domain) as a positive control(Chung et al. J Biol Chem 2014). The new data shown in Figure 3—figure supplement 1A demonstrated that FBXO45 and FBXO45ΔF (FBXO45 without F-box domain) could pulldown N-cadherien, suggesting N-cadherin didn’t bound FBXO45 at F-box domain. However, FBXO45 but not FBXO45ΔF could pulldown IGF2BP1(Figure 3D), indicating that IGF2BP1 interacts with FBXO45 at the F-box domain.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>13. Another possibility is that FBXO45 forms a complex with the E3 ubiquitin ligase PAM, as previously shown by Saiga et al. 2020. In this case, have the authors looked whether the ubiquitylation of IGF2BP1 is dependent on PAM activity? Have the authors attempted to reconstitute this complex in vitro and undertake in vitro ubiquitylation experiments?</p></disp-quote><p>We have followed up this Reviewer’s constructive suggestion and analyzed whether PAM was involved in FBXO45-mediated IGF2BP1 ubiquitination. As new data shown in Figure 3—figure supplement 2A of the revised manuscript, knockdown of PAM could significantly attenuated FBXO45-mediated IGF2BP1 ubiquitination, suggesting he ubiquitylation of IGF2BP1 is dependent on PAM activity.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>14. The composition and architecture of the ubiquitin chain should also be studied in more detail. The evidence provided here suggests that IGF2BP1 K190/450 sited are ubiquitylated with K63 linked chains; however, additional experiments would be required. This could include sensitivity of the ubiquitin chain to different recombinant DUBs with pan, K48, or K63 activity.</p></disp-quote><p>Our previous result indicated that K63 mutant (K63R) could significantly blocked IGF2BP1 polyubiquitination compared with wild-type and K48 mutant ubiquitin group. In order to further validate this finding, we investigated the role of wild-type Ub, K63, and K48 Ub in FBXO45-mediated IGF2BP1 ubiquitination. We found that K63 Ub- mediated IGF2BP1 ubiquitination was similar to wild-type Ub group, and they were all stronger than K48 Ub group (New data shown in Figure 3—figure supplement 1D). Taken together, these results indicated that FBXO45 promoted IGF2BP1 via K63-linked ubiquitination.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>15. The authors report on a novel mouse strain that over-expresses FBXO45; however, it has not been shown whether this strain produces higher protein levels. The authors should analyze FBXO45 levels in different tissues. It is also unclear whether higher FBXO45 protein levels would translate into more active FBXO45. How is the activity of this protein regulated in cells?</p></disp-quote><p>Thanks for this Reviewer’s suggestion. We have detected the FBXO45 expression by IHC staining and WB. The new data shown in Figure 5E, 6D and Figure 2—figure supplement 1B indicated the higher expression of FBXO45 in overexpressed FBXO45 liver tissues. Also, we have analyzed FBXO45 levels in different tissues and found that FBXO45 is highly expressed in liver tissues compared with other tissues (i.g. brain, spleen, kidney, lung and skin) (New data shown in Figure 2—figure supplement 1C of the revised manuscript). Based on our in vivo and in vitro cell proliferation assay, it indicated that high expression of FBXO45 could translate into more active FBXO45 and promote tumor growth and cell proliferation (Figure 2A , 2I-K, Figure 2—figure supplement 1E-G).</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>16.
