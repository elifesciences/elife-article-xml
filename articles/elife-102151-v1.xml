glia (MG), reprogramming into proliferating MG-derived progenitor cells (MGPCs), and neuronal differentiation of the progeny of MGPCs in the chick retina. We found that S1P-related genes are highly expressed by retinal neurons and glia, and levels of expression were dynamically regulated following retinal damage. Drug treatments that activate S1P receptor 1 (S1PR1) or increase levels of S1P suppressed the formation of MGPCs. Conversely, treatments that inhibit S1PR1 or decrease levels of S1P stimulated the formation of MGPCs. Inhibition of S1P receptors or S1P synthesis significantly enhanced the neuronal differentiation of the progeny of MGPCs. We report that S1P-related gene expression in MG is modulated by microglia and inhibition of S1P receptors or S1P synthesis partially rescues the loss of MGPC formation in damaged retinas missing microglia. Finally, we show that TGFβ/Smad3 signaling in the resting retina maintains S1PR1 expression in MG. We conclude that the S1P signaling is dynamically regulated in MG and MGPCs in the chick retina, and activation of S1P signaling depends, in part, on signals produced by reactive microglia.</p></abstract><abstract abstract-type="plain-language-summary"><title>eLife digest</title><p>The retina is a layered structure of the central nervous system located at the back of our eyes that contains neuronal cells. Retinal neurons convert visible light into nerve signals, which travel from our eyes to our brain along the optic nerve, allowing us to see. Healthy retinas are, therefore, critical for vision.</p><p>Unfortunately, many factors can damage our retinas. These range from acute eye injuries to eye diseases like diabetic retinopathy and glaucoma; if too many neurons are damaged, it can lead to blindness. In some animals, damaged retinas can repair themselves, or ‘regenerate’. This ability varies depending on the species: in fish, retinal regeneration is highly efficient, but it is reduced in birds and entirely absent in mammals – including humans.</p><p>In animals that can regenerate their retinas, the resident support cells of the retina (called Müller glia) respond to retinal injury by dividing to form progenitor cells. These progenitor cells can further reprogram into new neurons to replace damaged tissue and restore sight. The efficiency of this regeneration process depends on how many cells proliferate and the ability of these progenitors to become neurons. In birds, for example, many progenitor cells are formed, but only a fraction turn into neurons.</p><p>In the Müller glia of birds – specifically, in chicks – the activity of the genes for a set of biological signals (collectively termed the S1P signalling pathway, or S1P) changes after retinal injury. More generally, S1P is also known to be associated with tissue damage and inflammation. Taylor et al. therefore wanted to determine if S1P played a role in chick retinal regeneration, particularly in the development of Müller glia into ‘successful’ progenitor cells capable of replacing damaged neurons.</p><p>Taylor et al. employed a combination of microscopy and genetic techniques to track the production of various cell types and measure S1P gene activity under different conditions. When chick retinas were treated with drugs known to suppress S1P activity, the production of progenitor cells increased. Importantly, these new progenitor cells were also more likely to develop into new neurons. In contrast, drugs that turned on S1P activity resulted in fewer progenitor cells being formed. These findings suggest that S1P signalling activity suppresses retinal regeneration.</p><p>This study adds to our understanding of how inflammatory signals control the retina’s ability to repair itself after damage. However, more research is needed to determine the role of S1P in mammalian retinas. Ultimately, Taylor et al. hope that the knowledge gained will produce treatments to recover vision for people with retinal disease.</p></abstract><kwd-group kwd-group-type="author-keywords"><kwd>retinal regeneration</kwd><kwd>Müller glia</kwd><kwd>Müller glia-derived progenitor cells</kwd><kwd>MGPCs</kwd><kwd>Sphingosine 1 phosphate</kwd><kwd>S1P</kwd></kwd-group><kwd-group kwd-group-type="research-organism"><title>Research organism</title><kwd>Chicken</kwd></kwd-group><funding-group><award-group id="fund1"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000053</institution-id><institution>National Eye Institute</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>R01 EY032141-03</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Fischer</surname><given-names>Andy J</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund2"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000053</institution-id><institution>National Eye Institute</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>R01 EY032141-04</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Fischer</surname><given-names>Andy J</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><funding-statement>The funders had no role in study design, data collection and interpretation, or the decision to submit the work for publication.</funding-statement></funding-group><custom-meta-group><custom-meta specific-use="meta-only"><meta-name>Author impact statement</meta-name><meta-value>Inflammatory S1P signaling is dynamically regulated in chick Müller glia after retinal injury and suppresses Müller glia reprogramming into neuron-like cells.</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta specific-use="meta-only"><meta-name>publishing-route</meta-name><meta-value>prc</meta-value></custom-meta></custom-meta-group></article-meta></front><body><sec id="s1" sec-type="intro"><title>Introduction</title><p>Different cell signaling pathways are known to regulate the reprogramming of Müller glia (MG) into MG-derived progenitor cells (MGPCs) in damaged retinas. There are crucial roles of growth factors, pro-inflammatory cytokines, and transcription factors in the regulation of MG reprogramming into MGPCs in different vertebrate species (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib63">Taylor et al., 2024</xref>). Nuclear Factor Kappa B (NFκB) is one the key cell signaling ‘hubs’ that regulates the reactivity of MG, acts restore glial quiescence and suppress the neurogenic of MG-derived progenitors in the mouse retina (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Hoang et al., 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib43">Palazzo et al., 2022</xref>). We found that NFκB signaling in damaged retinas is manifested in MG by pro-inflammatory signals produced by activated microglia (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib43">Palazzo et al., 2022</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib44">Palazzo et al., 2023</xref>). Further, we show that inhibition of NFκB-signaling results in diminished recruitment of immune cells in damaged retinas, increased neuronal survival, and increased formation of neuron-like cells from Ascl1-overexpressing MG (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib43">Palazzo et al., 2022</xref>). In the chick retina, by comparison, rapid activation of NFκB via signals produced by reactive microglia starts the process of MG activation and reprogramming, but sustained NFκB signaling suppresses the proliferating of MGPCs and neuronal differentiation of progeny (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib42">Palazzo et al., 2020</xref>). NFκB signaling is known to be coordinated with Sphingosine-1-phosphate (S1P) signaling to regulate different cellular processes, including inflammation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Blom et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib46">Pérez-Jeldres et al., 2021</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib77">Zheng et al., 2019</xref>).</p><p>S1P signaling is a promising candidate to regulate the ability of MG to reprogram into proliferating, neurogenic progenitor cells. S1P is produced by sphingosine kinases (SPHK1 and SPHK2) and is degraded by a lyase (SGPL1). Notably, SPHK2 does not directly contribute to levels of secreted S1P (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib64">Thuy et al., 2022</xref>), nor is it annotated in the chick genome. S1P can be exported from cells by a transporter (MFSD2A and SPNS2) or converted to sphingosine by a phosphatase (SGPP1). Levels of sphingosine are increased by ASAH1 by conversion of ceramide or decreased by CERS2/5/6 by conversion to ceramide. S1P is known to activate G-protein-coupled receptors, S1PR1 through S1PR5. S1PRs are known to activate different cell signaling pathways including MAPK and PI3K/mTor, and crosstalk with pro-inflammatory pathways such as NFκB (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Hu et al., 2020</xref>). Alternatively, activation of S1PRs can activate Jak/Stat signaling, which upregulates Egr1 to upregulate pro-inflammatory cytokines that secondarily activate NFκB (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Gurgui et al., 2010</xref>). S1P signaling is an important pathway that has been widely implicated as mediating inflammatory responses, cellular proliferation, promote survival, and regulate angiogenesis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib40">Obinata and Hla, 2019</xref>). S1P signaling is required for vascular maturation, progenitor cell-cycle exit, and axon guidance in the developing retina (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib57">Simón et al., 2019</xref>). However, S1P can have detrimental effects including migration of MG, angiogenesis, and inflammation associated with proliferative retinopathies and aging. Most of these studies in retinal cells were conducted in vitro, and these studies need to be followed-up by in vivo analyses to assess the coordinated impact of S1P signaling on the many different cell types in the retina. The functions of S1P signaling in normal and damaged retinas are poorly understood, and nothing is known about how S1P signaling impacts MG-mediated retinal regeneration.</p><p>Pro-inflammatory signaling represses reprogramming of mouse MG by promoting reactivity networks and anti-neurogenic factors, while increasing cell death in damage retinas (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib43">Palazzo et al., 2022</xref>). Therefore, it is important to understand how different cell signaling pathways impact inflammation to develop techniques to enhance neuronal survival and retinal regeneration. In this study, we target S1P synthesis, S1P degradation and S1P receptors to investigate the roles of S1P signaling during damage-dependent MG reprogramming and neurogenesis in the chick model system.</p></sec><sec id="s2" sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><sec id="s2-1"><title>S1P signaling regulates the formation of MGPCs in damaged retinas</title><p>We first probed for patterns of expression of S1P-related genes in a large aggregate scRNA-seq library of &gt;180,000 cells isolated from retinas treated with saline, NMDA, or two or three doses insulin + FGF2 and the combination of NMDA and insulin + FGF2 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1a</xref>), as described previously (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Clark et al., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Campbell et al., 2022</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">El-Hodiri et al., 2022</xref>).

S1P and ceramides have been described as a rheostat that regulates cell survival; S1P is protective, and ceramides trigger apoptotic pathways (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib57">Simón et al., 2019</xref>). ASAH1 (acid ceramidase) acts to restrict ceramide accumulation and is dynamically regulated in the chick retina (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1</xref>). To investigate whether ceramide accumulation regulates cell survival and MGPC proliferation, we applied an acid ceramidase inhibitor (Ceranib-2) before and following NMDA-treatment (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s3">Figure 4—figure supplement 3</xref>). We observed no significant differences in cell death, microglia reactivity, MGPC proliferation between Ceranib-2-treated retinas and control damaged retinas (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s3">Figure 4—figure supplement 3</xref>). Thus, ceramide accumulation may not impact cell survival or the responses of MG to retinal damage.</p><p>MG reprogramming remains robust in mature chick retinas from P7 and up to P30, but the zones of proliferation become increasingly confined to the peripheral regions of retina (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Fischer and Reh, 2003b</xref>). In post-hatch chick retina, it is likely that MG ‘maturation’ occurs in a central-to-peripheral gradient, much like the process neuronal differentiation in the embryonic retina. Accordingly, a zone of regeneration-competent MG persists in the retinal periphery in maturing chicks. We have previously shown that the expression of Notch-related genes differs by retinal region and chick age, and Notch inhibition suppresses numbers of MGPCs in central but not peripheral regions (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Ghai et al., 2010</xref>).

We collected whole retinas 48 hr after saline treatment, Sphk1 inhibitor (PF543) treatment, NMDA-treatment, NMA + PF543 treatment, or NMDA + S1P lyase inhibitor (S1PLin31) treatment. As predicted, Sphk1 inhibitor treatment decreased levels of S1P in undamaged retinas (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5e</xref>). We found that S1P levels increased in NMDA-treated retinas, which correlated well with increased Sphk1 transcript levels after damage. Surprisingly, SPHK1 inhibitor treatment was not sufficient to ameliorate high levels of S1P induced by NMDA. It is possible that the effects of PF-543 (<italic>k</italic><sub>off</sub> <italic>t</italic><sub>1/2</sub> = 8.5 min) subsided in the 24 hr prior to tissue collection. Alternatively, this observation may reflect the rapid and transient nature of SPHK1 activity after damage, which is consistent with prior experimental observations; we found that S1P/S1PR1-targeting drugs had to be applied prior to NMDA damage to produce robust effects on MGPC proliferation (data not shown). S1P lyase inhibitor treatment robustly boosted levels of S1P in damaged retinas (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5f</xref>). In summary, differences in levels of S1P between undamaged retinas and NMDA-treatment are consistent with observed Sphk1 RNA levels (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2e, f</xref>).

It is important to understand how pro-inflammatory signaling fits into the complex network of pathways that control MG reprogramming. We provide evidence that S1P signaling is among the network of pro-inflammatory pathways the regulate the responses of MG to retinal damage. Here, we report patterns of expression of S1P-signaling components and the effects of activating or inhibiting S1P signaling on regeneration in the chick retina. This study highlights the significant role of S1PR1, which is highly expressed in resting MG and non-neurogenic MGPCs, in suppressing damage-dependent MGPC proliferation and neuronal differentiation. Inhibition of S1PR1 promoted MGPC cell-cycle re-entry and enhanced the number of regenerated amacrine-like cells after retinal damage. Inhibition of S1P synthesis produced similar effects to inhibiting S1PR1 to promote MGPC formation, and inhibiting S1P degradation produced similar effects to activating S1PR1 to inhibit MGPC formation.</p><sec id="s3-1"><title>Specificity of drugs</title><p>We report cell-specific effects of different agonists and antagonists that increase or decrease S1P signaling that is centered on the MG. Since we compare cell-level effects within contralateral eyes wherein one retina is exposed to vehicle and the other is exposed to vehicle plus drug, it seems highly likely that the drugs are responsible for eliciting effects upon the MG. It seems unlikely that the cellular responses that we describe resulted from drugs acting at extra-retinal tissues which secondarily release factors that selectively impact the MG and elicit cellular responses that are inferred by the different agonists/antagonists and consistent with patterns of expression for S1P-related genes. For example, using scRNA-seq and FISH, we find that <italic>S1PR1</italic> and <italic>S1PR3</italic> expression is predominant in MG. Thus, we expect that S1PR1/3 inhibitors directly act on MG and this is consistent with readouts of cell signaling with injections of S1P in undamaged retinas. We show that <italic>SPHK1</italic> and <italic>SGPL1</italic>, which encode the enzymes that synthesize or degrade S1P, are expressed by different retinal cell types, including the MG. The efficacy of the drugs that target SPHK1 and SGPL1 was supported by findings that inhibition of S1P synthesis significantly decreased levels of S1P in normal retinas, whereas inhibition of S1P degradation increased levels of S1P in damaged retinas. Further, inhibition of SPHK1 (to decrease levels S1P) results in decreased levels of ATF3, pS6 (mTor), and pSMAD1/5/9 in MG, consistent with the notion that reduced levels of S1P in the retina impacts signaling at S1PR1/3 that are expressed by MG. Finally, we find similar cellular responses to chemically different agonists or antagonists that target the same protein, and we find opposite cellular responses to agonists and antagonists that target the same protein, which is expected to be complimentary if the drugs are acting specifically at the intended targets.</p></sec><sec id="s3-2"><title>Regulation of S1PR1 expression</title><p>The identity of factors that downregulate S1PR1 in MG in damaged retinas remains uncertain.

Previous studies have found S1P production and S1P receptor activation are regulated by several growth factor receptors, including EGFR and VEGFR (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Igarashi et al., 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib45">Paugh et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib60">Sukocheva et al., 2006</xref>). In the current study, FGF and insulin treatment were sufficient to downregulate <italic>S1PR1</italic> without retinal damage. Further, we found that TGFβ-dependent Smad3 activity stimulates <italic>S1PR1</italic> expression in resting retinas. These findings support prior in vitro studies which report that TGFβ treatment robustly drives upregulation of S1PR1-3 mRNA and protein (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">Lin et al., 2022</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib73">Yang et al., 2018</xref>). We have previously reported that TGFβ1 is expressed by microglia and TGFβ3 is expressed by neurons in resting retinas, and TGFβ-treatment in damaged retinas suppresses MGPC formation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">El-Hodiri et al., 2023</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib67">Todd et al., 2017</xref>). Thus, homeostatic TGFβ/Smad2/3 signaling between microglia and MG may maintain <italic>S1PR1</italic> expression to promote quiescence in MG.</p><p>Several TFs have been found to influence <italic>S1PR1</italic> expression. KLF2, FOXF1, STAT1, and YAP have been found to directly bind to the S1PR1 promoter to positively regulate transcription (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Cai et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Carlson et al., 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib62">Tao et al., 2023</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib72">Xin et al., 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib78">Zheng et al., 2023</xref>). Notably, due to the sequestering of NFκB co-activators by KLF2, S1PR1 transcription is linked to the silencing of NFκB-related pro-inflammatory genes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Jha and Das, 2017</xref>). Conversely, S1PR1 activity has been shown to promote downstream NFκB-mediated gene transcription (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib51">Rostami et al., 2019</xref>). Thus, signaling through S1PR1 is part of an intricate bidirectional regulatory network that imparts influence through the NFκB pathway. Taken together with present findings, this is consistent with the reported roles of NFκB signaling in rapid microglia-mediated activation of MG and thereafter suppression of MGPC formation in damaged retinas (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib42">Palazzo et al., 2020</xref>).</p><p>S1P synthesis in MG in damaged retinas may be a symptom of glial maturation and loss of the ability to reprogram into progenitor-like cells. Unlike MG in peripheral regions of retina, <italic>SPHK1</italic> is not increased in MG and inhibition of SPHK1 does not stimulate the formation of MGPCs in central regions of retina (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s4">Figure 4—figure supplement 4</xref>). Similarly, we have previously reported that Notch-related genes show different patterns of expression in the central and peripheral regions of the retina, and expression levels differentially change at P0, P7, and P21 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Ghai et al., 2010</xref>). We reported that Notch inhibition reduced cell death and numbers of MGPCs in central regions but not peripheral regions. Because retinal differentiation occurs in a central-to-peripheral gradient and zones of MGPC proliferation become increasingly confined to the periphery in post-hatch birds (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Fischer, 2005</xref>), we hypothesize that maturing MG undergo a shift in maturity or reprogramming competence in a central-to-peripheral gradient. Notch and S1P signaling may be components of this maturation process, but spatial transcriptomic analyses are needed to reveal key differences in signaling pathway gene expression which confer a persistent competence for MG-mediated regeneration in the periphery of chick retinas.</p></sec><sec id="s3-3"><title>S1PR1 activation and downstream inflammatory signaling</title><p>We and others have reported that inflammatory cytokine signaling is necessary for the initiation of MG cell-cycle re-entry in chicks and zebrafish (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Fischer et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib56">Silva et al., 2020</xref>), but persistent microglial reactivity and NFκB signaling suppress MG reprogramming (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib42">Palazzo et al., 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib71">White et al., 2017</xref>). In the current study, we report that S1PR1 activity suppresses MGPC proliferation and neurogenesis without impacting microglia. We report differential activation of Jak/Stat, mTOR, and Smad pathways in MG treated with exogenous S1P or SPHK1 inhibitor. These pathways are activated following NMDA-treatment and are necessary for MGPC formation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib65">Todd et al., 2016a</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib67">Todd et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib76">Zelinka et al., 2016</xref>).</p><p>S1PR1 inhibitors and NFκB inhibitors produce similar effects on MGPC proliferation in damaged retinas (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib42">Palazzo et al., 2020</xref>). In the absence of microglia, S1PR1 inhibition promoted damage-dependent MGPC formation but application of an NFκB <italic>activator</italic> was found to increase MGPCs. A comparison of these findings may support the notion that NFκB signaling must be transiently activated to initiate dedifferentiation but must be later suppressed to release the glial phenotype and permit cell-cycle re-entry. It is probable that S1PR1 activation potentiates downstream NFκB signaling to suppress regeneration, but we could not confirm this in the current study; we have not identified antibodies to NFκB pathway components that produce plausible patterns of expression in chick retinas.</p><p>Although S1P signaling has been shown to activate the NFκB pathway, we find distinct differences between the impacts of S1P and NFκB signaling on cell signaling in MG, neuronal differentiation of the progeny of MGPCs and neuronal survival in damaged retinas. In the current study we demonstrate that intravitreal injections of S1P activate mTor (pS6) and Jak/Stat3 (pStat3) signaling in MG. Further, inhibition of S1P synthesis decreased ATF3, mTor (pS6) and pSmad1/5/9 levels in activated MG in damaged retinas. By contrast, inhibition of NFκB signaling in damaged chick retinas did not impact the above-mentioned cell signaling pathways (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib42">Palazzo et al., 2020</xref>). However, we cannot exclude the possibility of cross-talk between NFκB and different cell signaling pathways. Further, inhibition of NFκB signaling potently decreases numbers of dying cells and increases numbers of surviving ganglion cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib42">Palazzo et al., 2020</xref>). Consistent with these findings, a TNF orthologue, which activates NFκB signaling, exacerbates cell death in damage chick retinas (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib42">Palazzo et al., 2020</xref>). By contrast, five different drugs targeting S1P signaling had no effect on numbers of dying cells and only one S1PR1 inhibitor modestly decreased numbers of dying cells (current study). Although different inhibitors of NFκB-signaling suppressed the proliferation of microglia in damaged retinas (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib42">Palazzo et al., 2020</xref>), all of the S1P-targeting drugs had no effect upon the proliferation of microglia (current study). In addition, inhibition of NFκB does not influence the neurogenic potential of MGPCs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib42">Palazzo et al., 2020</xref>), whereas inhibition of S1P receptors or inhibition of S1P synthesis increased the differentiation of amacrine-like neurons in damaged retinas (current study). Collectively, our findings indicate that S1P signaling through S1PR1 and S1PR3 in MG has distinct effects upon cell signaling pathways, neuronal regeneration and cell survival compared to the effects of pro-inflammatory cytokines and NFκB-signaling in the retina.</p></sec><sec id="s3-4"><title>S1P and neuronal differentiation</title><p>We found that inhibitors to SPHK1, S1PR1, or S1PR1/3 increased numbers of cells that differentiated as amacrine-like cells that expressed HuC/D. However, none the progeny of MGPCs differentiated into cells that expressed calretinin (a subset of amacrine cells) or visinin (photoreceptors). There is currently no evidence that MGPCs in the chick retina can produce progeny that differentiate into photoreceptors. By contrast, we recently reported that inhibition of ID factors enhances neuronal differentiation of calretinin-expressing MGPC-derived cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib63">Taylor et al., 2024</xref>). Calretinin may be expressed by a subset of amacrine cells not specified by inhibition of S1P receptors. Alternatively, the progeny of MGPC do not fully differentiate to the point where calretinin is expressed when S1P signaling is diminished. Control over the differentiation of MGPC progeny is regulated by different cell signaling pathways. For example, activation of retinoic acid receptors stimulates neuronal differentiation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib68">Todd et al., 2018</xref>), whereas signaling through Notch (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Ghai et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Hayes et al., 2007</xref>), glucocorticoid receptors (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Fischer et al., 2014</xref>), and Jak/Stat3 pathway (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib66">Todd et al., 2016b</xref>) suppress neuronal differentiation. It is possible that activation of S1P receptors acts through Jak/Stat3 or possibly NFκB to suppress the neuronal differentiation of MGPC progeny. Our data indicate that <italic>S1PR1</italic> is downregulated by activated MG and proliferating MGPCs. However, <italic>S1PR3</italic> is upregulated in MGPCs and, thus, it is likely that signaling through S1PR3 mediates the cell-fate specification of MGPC progeny.</p></sec><sec id="s3-5"><title>S1P signaling and neuroprotection</title><p>The current study provides evidence that inhibition of the S1P pathway supports neuron survival in the damaged chick retinas. In retinas where microglia were absent, we found that SPHK1 inhibitor PF543 and S1PR1 inhibitor MT1303 alleviated retinal cell death. In retinas where microglia were present, only MT1303 significantly reduced numbers of dying cells. As mentioned previously, NFκB-related genes are regulated in a similar pattern to S1P-related genes; inhibiting NFκB signaling supports inner retinal cell and retinal ganglion cell survival (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib42">Palazzo et al., 2020</xref>). In contrast, we recently reported that Inhibitor of DNA-binding 4 (ID4) factor is transiently upregulated in MG after NMDA and may support the survival of inner retinal neurons (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib63">Taylor et al., 2024</xref>). Other factors such as fatty acid binding proteins (FABPs) and Midkine are also rapidly upregulated in activated MG and these factors are neuroprotective (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Carlson et al., 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Campbell et al., 2022</xref>).</p><p>Interestingly, one of the S1PR1 inhibitors, NIBR0213, <italic>increased</italic> cell death in damaged retinas where microglia were absent. This disparity might be explained by differences in inhibitor specificity. MT1303 is a potent functional antagonist which induces receptor internalization and degradation, whereas NIB0213 is slightly less potent and does not drive internalization (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib49">Quancard et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib54">Shimano et al., 2019</xref>). Further, MT1303 is a prodrug (requiring phosphorylation) and has an elimination half-life of several days, whereas direct-acting NIBR0213 has a half-life of a few hours (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib49">Quancard et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib54">Shimano et al., 2019</xref>).

We found that SPHK1, which catalyzes the synthesis of S1P from sphingosine, was expressed by cells scattered across different types of retinal cells. Further, SGPL1, which catalyzes the degradation of S1P, had dynamic patterns of expression following NMDA-treatment in different types of retinal cells, including amacrine cells and microglia. These finding suggest that S1P is secreted by these cells to bind to S1P receptors on MG. S1P:S1PR paracrine signaling has been observed between neural cells and astrocytes and is hypothesized to be necessary for proper astrocyte morphogenesis during synapse formation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Alam et al., 2023</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib58">Singh et al., 2022</xref>). Another possibility is that S1P produced by SPHK2. However, SPHK2 is not annotated in the <italic>Gallus gallus</italic> genome, and we could not identify any genes that aligned significantly with <italic>SPHK2</italic> from other bird species. Further, this gene was not expressed at significant levels in scRNA libraries created from mouse, zebrafish, or pig retinas. A final possibility is that changes in S1P metabolism in retinal neurons are a byproduct of the recycling of other sphingolipid molecules in response to NMDA damage.</p></sec><sec id="s3-7"><title>The sphingolipid ‘rheostat’ in the retina</title><p>S1P synthesis is dependent on the availability of ceramides and ceramide-related enzymes like acid ceramidase (ASAH1).

Similarly, the protective effects of S1P are countered by ceramides, which activate intrinsic and extrinsic apoptotic pathways (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib57">Simón et al., 2019</xref>).

Our findings suggest that S1PR1 activity maintains quiescence in MG and acts to drive activate toward a resting phenotype. The expression of S1PR1 is regulated by microglia, neuronal damage and TGFβ/Smad3 signaling. Inhibitors to S1P synthesis or S1PR1 signaling promoted MGPC cell-cycle re-entry and enhanced neural differentiation. Interestingly, patterns of expression of S1P-related genes are highly conserved across vertebrates, namely high levels of expression of S1PR1 in the MG in chick, fish and human retinas. Activation of S1PR1 in MG is one of the key pro-inflammatory signaling pathways that control glial responses to neuronal damage, microglial activation, and the ability of MG to reprogram into neurogenic progenitor-like cells.</p></sec></sec><sec id="s4" sec-type="methods"><title>Methods</title><sec id="s4-1"><title>Animals</title><p>The animal use approved in these experiments was in accordance with the guidelines established by the National Institutes of Health and IACUC at The Ohio State University (protocol # 2009A0139-R5).

The S1P-targetting drugs are classified as BDDCS Class II, indicating low solubility but high cell permeability.

Sphingosine-1-shosphate (d18:1) (S1P) and sphingosine (d17:1) (Avanti Polar Lipids) were used as internal standards. Retinal samples were extracted with 80% methanol at a ratio of 1:20 (wt/vol) in a 2-ml Eppendorf tube.

Images were optimized for color, brightness, and contrast, multiple channels over laid and figures constructed using Adobe Photoshop. Cell counts were performed on representative images. To avoid the possibility of region-specific differences within the retina, cell counts were consistently made from the same region of retina for each dataset. Peripheral regions of the retina were designated as 1–3 mm from the circumferential marginal zone, and central regions of the retina were designated as within 3 mm of the posterior pole of the eye in the nasotemporal plane.</p><p>The sample size for this study was determined through a power analysis.

The authors describe the expression of S1P signaling components. Using agonist and antagonist of the pathways they also investigate their effect on the de-differentiation and proliferation of Muller glial cells in damaged retina of postnatal chicks. They show that S1PR1 is highly expressed in resting MG and non-neurogenic MGPCs. This receptor suppresses the proliferation and neuronal activity promotes MGPC cell cycle re-entry and enhanced the number of regenerated amacrine-like cells after retinal damage. The formation of MGPCs in damaged retinas is impaired in the absence of microglial cells. This study further shows that ablation of microglial cells from the retina increases the expression of S1P-related genes in MG, whereas inhibition of S1PR1 and SPHK1 partially rescues the formation of MGPCs in damaged retinas depleted of microglia. The studies also show that expression of S1P-related genes is conserved in fish and human retinas.</p><p>Strengths:</p><p>This is well-conducted study, with convincing images and statistically relevant data</p><p>Weaknesses:</p><p>In a previous study, the authors have shown that S1P is upstream of NF-κB signaling (Palazzo et al. 2020; 2022, 2023).

This study tested how S1P signaling regulates glial phenotype, dedifferentiation of, reprogramming into proliferating MG-derived progenitor cells (MGPCs), and neuronal differentiation of the progeny of MGPCs using in vivo chick retina. Major techniques used are Sc-RNASeq and immunohistochemistry to determine the gene expression and proliferation of MG cells that co-label with signaling antibodies or mRNA FISH following treating the in vivo eyes with various S1P signaling antagonists, agonists, and signal modulators. The major conclusions drawn are supported by the results presented.

S1P can be exported from cells by a transporter (MFSD2A and SPNS2) or converted to sphingosine by a phosphatase (SGPP1) (Fig. 2a). Levels of sphingosine are increased by ASAH1 by conversion of ceramide or decreased by CERS2/5/6 by conversion to ceramide (Fig. 2a). S1P is known to activate G-protein coupled receptors, S1PR1 through S1PR5 (Fig. 2a). S1PRs are known to activate different cell signaling pathways including MAPK and PI3K/mTor, and crosstalk with pro-inflammatory pathways such as NFκB (Fig. 2a) (Hu et al., 2020).&quot;</p></disp-quote><p>We have removed references to Fig. 2a, which was from a previous draft of this manuscript.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Please correct the typo in the following sentence (Fid.)</p><p>&quot;S1PR1 was most prominently expressed by resting MG and MG returning to a resting state, whereas S1PR3 was detected in relatively few scattered cells in clusters of MG, ganglion cells, horizontal cells, bipolar cells, amacrine cells, photoreceptors, oligodendrocytes, microglia and NIRG cells (Fid. 1d).</p></disp-quote><p>We have corrected this typo_._</p></body></sub-article></article>
