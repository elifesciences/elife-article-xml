These organs are thought to have arisen as vertebrates evolved from their filter-feeding ancestors and adopted an increasingly active and predatory lifestyle. The cranial placodes are tissues in the vertebrate embryo that give rise to many of these sense organs early in development. The sensory neurons that transmit information from the organs to the brain – including those that process hearing and smell – also develop from these tissues.</p><p>While much is known about how the sense organs work, relatively little is known about the early processes involved in their development. Two genes have been established as crucial for the formation and later development of the sense organs. These genes encode two proteins called Six1 and Eya1 that regulate other genes, although the identity of the genes that they target in placodes was not known.</p><p>Using computational and experimental approaches in the African clawed frog (<italic>Xenopus laevis</italic>), Riddiford and Schlosser identified hundreds of genes that are regulated by both Six1 and Eya1 in placodes. Many of these targeted genes regulate the activity of other genes and direct important cell decisions, such as whether a stem cell should develop into a neuron. After validating several of these targets in the laboratory, Riddiford and Schlosser proposed a network of gene regulation, activated by Six1 and Eya1, that drives sense organ development in vertebrates.</p><p>While Riddiford and Schlosser provide strong evidence that Six1 and Eya1 directly regulate many of the newly identified genes, further work is required to firmly establish this. Future studies could also explore how Six1 and Eya1 drive seemingly contradictory cellular decisions, encouraging some stem cells to develop into neurons and others to maintain a stem-like state.</p><p><bold>DOI:</bold> <ext-link ext-link-type="doi" xlink:href="10.7554/eLife.17666.002">http://dx.doi.org/10.7554/eLife.17666.002</ext-link></p></abstract><kwd-group kwd-group-type="author-keywords"><title>Author Keywords</title><kwd>cranial placodes</kwd><kwd>Six1</kwd><kwd>Eya1</kwd><kwd>sense organs</kwd></kwd-group><kwd-group kwd-group-type="research-organism"><title>Research Organism</title><kwd><italic>Xenopus</italic></kwd></kwd-group><funding-group><award-group id="par-1"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100001602</institution-id><institution>Science Foundation Ireland</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>11/RFP/EOB/3168</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Schlosser</surname><given-names>Gerhard</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><funding-statement>The funders had no role in study design, data collection and interpretation, or the decision to submit the work for publication.</funding-statement></funding-group><custom-meta-group><custom-meta><meta-name>elife-xml-version</meta-name><meta-value>2.5</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta specific-use="meta-only"><meta-name>Author impact statement</meta-name><meta-value>RNA sequencing of the African clawed frog has identified hundreds of putative direct Six1 and Eya1 target genes, including transcriptional regulators of neuronal progenitors and neuronal/sensory differentiation.</meta-value></custom-meta></custom-meta-group></article-meta></front><body><sec id="s1" sec-type="intro"><title>Introduction</title><p>The cranial placodes give rise to many sense organs of the vertebrate head (including nose, ear and lateral line) and contribute to the anterior pituitary and sensory ganglia of the cranial nerves. Together with the neural crest, which also contributes to cranial ganglia as well as the head skeleton, they originated as an evolutionary novelty in stem vertebrates, on the adoption of a more active and exploratory life style (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib72">Northcutt and Gans, 1983</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib91">Schlosser, 2015</xref>). Defects in placode development underlie many congenital diseases of sensory organs and the endocrine system (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib78">Petit et al., 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Davis et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib106">Xu, 2013</xref>), however, despite this central importance of placodes in the evolution and development of the vertebrate head, they have been much less well studied than the neural crest, and little is known about the gene regulatory networks (GRNs) driving early placode development.</p><p>Fate mapping studies have shown that all cranial placodes develop from a common precursor region, the pre-placodal ectoderm (PPE) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib95">Streit, 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Bhattacharyya et al., 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib105">Xu et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib80">Pieper et al., 2011</xref>). In neural plate stage embryos, the PPE is located as a horseshoe-shaped domain around the anterior neural plate (and abutting the cranial neural crest laterally) which subsequently breaks up into individual placodes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib90">Schlosser, 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Grocott et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib83">Saint-Jeannet and Moody, 2014</xref>). Molecularly, the PPE is characterised by the expression of <italic>Six1</italic> and <italic>Eya1</italic>, which also continues in most placodes derived from the PPE (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib86">Schlosser and Ahrens, 2004</xref>). Whereas <italic>Six1</italic> encodes a transcription factor, <italic>Eya1</italic> encodes a transcriptional co-activator that also has phosphatase activity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib51">Kumar, 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib98">Tadjuidje and Hegde, 2013</xref>), and Six1 and Eya1 have been shown to form a protein complex and synergistically activate transcription (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib73">Ohto et al., 1999</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib57">Li et al., 2013</xref>). However, both Six1 and Eya1 also interact with other protein interaction partners; Six1, for example, has been shown to act as a transcriptional repressor after binding to the co-repressor Groucho (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Brugmann et al., 2004</xref>) whereas Eya1 is known to form protein complexes with other binding partners including the transcription factor Sox2 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Ahmed et al., 2012a</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib98">Tadjuidje and Hegde, 2013</xref>).</p><p>Loss of Six1 or Eya1 function in mouse, zebrafish, chick or <italic>Xenopus</italic> embryos leads to a similar spectrum of PPE and placodal defects, with altered expression of other PPE genes, decreased proliferation and increased apoptosis in many placodes, compromised morphogenetic movements (invagination or cell delamination) and a decreased production of sensory cells and neurons (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib107">Xu et al., 1999</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib52">Laclef et al., 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib110">Zheng et al., 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Brugmann et al., 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib112">Zou et al., 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib50">Kozlowski et al., 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib87">Schlosser et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Christophorou et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Ahmed et al., 2012a</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">2012b</xref>). In human patients, mutations in both Six1 and Eya1 lead to branchio-oto-renal (BOR) and branchio-otic (BO) syndromes with congenital hearing loss (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib48">Kochhar et al., 2007</xref>). These findings suggest that these proteins are core regulators of placode development and promote multiple aspects of placode development synergistically, although Eya1-independent roles of Six1 have also been reported (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Brugmann et al., 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Bricaud and Collazo, 2011</xref>). Specifically, Six1 and Eya1 have been shown to play central roles, during multiple steps, in the development of sensory cells (e.g. hair cells in the inner ear) as well as sensory neurons, and promote both the proliferation of sensory/neuronal progenitors as well as sensory and neuronal differentiation in a dosage dependent fashion (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib112">Zou et al., 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib87">Schlosser et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib111">Zou et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Ahmed et al., 2012b</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">2012a</xref>). Recently Atoh1, an essential determination gene for hair cell development, has been shown to be directly transcriptionally activated by Six1/Eya1 binding to its enhancer (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Ahmed et al., 2012a</xref>). Moreover, the neuronal progenitor genes <italic>Sox2</italic> and <italic>Sox3</italic> have been shown to be up-regulated by Six1 and Eya1 in the absence of protein synthesis, suggesting that they are also direct target genes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib87">Schlosser et al., 2008</xref>). Several other direct target genes of Six1 have been identified (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib51">Kumar, 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib106">Xu, 2013</xref>), but no specific screen for direct target genes of Six1 and Eya1 in the PPE and the developing placodes has yet been conducted.</p><p>Here, using RNA-Seq in <italic>Xenopus laevis</italic>, we present the first comprehensive screen for presumptive direct target genes of Six1 and Eya1 in the developing placodes in any vertebrate. Hormone-inducible constructs of Six1 and Eya1 (fused with the human glucocorticoid receptor [GR]) were overexpressed, either alone or in combination, in <italic>Xenopus</italic> embryos. We then explanted the PPE at neural fold stages and activated nuclear translocation of Six1 or Eya1 in these explants by the addition of dexamethasone (DEX) after blocking protein synthesis by cycloheximide (CHX). This approach has previously been shown to reliably activate direct targets of GR-fusion constructs only in the presence of DEX (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib49">Kolm and Sive, 1995</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib92">Seo et al., 2007</xref>). We then analysed the transcriptome of placodal explants by RNA-Seq and compared this to control explants which were not hormone induced, in order to specifically survey target genes directly activated or repressed by Six1 or Eya1 in the PPE and developing placodes. Using this method, we were able to identify a large number of novel target genes with potentially important roles for cranial placode development. We were further able to show in loss of function studies that several target genes encoding known regulators of progenitor fates (e.g. <italic>Sox2, Hes8</italic>) and neuronal/sensory differentiation (e.g. <italic>Ngn1, Atoh1, Pou4f1.2, Gfi1a</italic>) required both Six1 and Eya1 for their expression in the developing placodes. Our findings provide pioneering insights into the GRNs regulating placode development downstream of Six1 and Eya1, and suggest exciting new avenues of research for understanding placode development and disease.</p></sec><sec id="s2" sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><sec id="s2-1"><title>The pre-placodal transcriptome</title><p>RNA was extracted from explants cut from the PPE of un-injected embryos and characterised using RNA-Seq to provide a complete transcriptome of the PPE.

Hence, a subset of target genes with high response thresholds to the Six1-Eya1 coregulatory complex (e.g. due to low affinity binding sites) will respond to overexpression of Six1 or Eya1 alone with differential expression in these parts of the ectoderm while another subset of genes with low response thresholds (e.g. due to high affinity binding sites) will not. The latter subset will, thus, only be differentially expressed after overexpression of both Six1 and Eya1, creating expanded areas of Six1 and Eya1 coexpression in the ectoderm. Notably, the false discovery rate is expected to be lower for the former subset, which is supported by three independent treatment groups (Six1<sub>i</sub>, Eya1<sub>i</sub> and Six1+Eya1<sub>i</sub>), than in the latter subset, supported only by one (Six1+Eya1<sub>i</sub>).</p><p>About half of all genes differentially expressed in the PPE in our various treatment groups show evidence of co-regulation by Six1 and Eya1. This includes 690 (633+57) up-regulated and 444 (440+4) down-regulated genes (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2A and B</xref>). Indeed, the top 10% of transcripts (ranked by FC; post DEX-filtering) up-regulated in Six1<sub>i</sub>, Eya1<sub>i</sub> or Six+Eya1<sub>i</sub> treatment groups were each highly enriched for the top 10% of transcripts up-regulated in any of the other experimental treatment groups (p&lt;0.0001; Fisher’s exact test). More genes co-regulated by Six1 and Eya1 were up-regulated than were down-regulated (690/1134 = 60.8% for all co-regulated genes, 57/61 = 93.4% for co-regulated genes identified in each treatment group; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2A and B</xref>), corroborating previous findings that Six1 and Eya1 typically act synergistically to activate transcription (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Ahmed et al., 2012b</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">2012a</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Brugmann et al., 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Christophorou et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib56">Li et al., 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib82">Ruf et al., 2004</xref>). However, our identification of a subset of genes synergistically down-regulated by Six1 and Eya1 suggests that Eya1 may not always act as a co-activator of Six1.</p><p>In contrast, there is no support for co-regulation for genes that are differentially expressed only in Six1<sub>i</sub> but not Eya1<sub>i</sub> treatment groups (and vice versa) even for those genes that are also differentially expressed after Six1+Eya1<sub>i</sub> treatment. We identified 283 (190+93) genes up-regulated and 270 (233+37) genes down-regulated by Six1 but not Eya1, indicating that these are regulated by Six1 in an Eya1 independent way but possibly dependent on other co-factors. Conversely, we identified 426 (373+53) genes up-regulated and 196 (187+9) genes down-regulated by Eya1 but not Six1 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2A,B</xref>) suggesting that these are regulated by Eya1 in conjunction with transcription factors other than Six1.</p><p>To add statistical power to our analysis, we next merged treatment groups and determined significantly differentially expressed genes (q&lt;0.05) in these merged groups. We first created a data set Six1+Eya1<sub>m</sub> in which all replicates that involved overexpression of either Six1 or Eya1 were considered as equivalent (injection of Six1-GR, Eya1-GR or Six1-GR+Eya1-GR; 6 replicates in total). This allowed us to identify genes that are significantly differentially expressed across all treatment groups. We also created a data set Six1<sub>m</sub>, in which all replicates that involved Six1 overexpression were considered as equivalent (injection of Six1-GR or Six1-GR+Eya1-GR; 4 replicates). This allowed us to identify genes with significant differential expression after Six1 upregulation. Similarly, we created data set Eya1<sub>m</sub> based on all replicates that involved Eya1 overexpression (injection of Eya1-GR or Six1-GR+Eya1-GR; 4 replicates) allowing us to identify genes differentially expressed after Eya1 upregulation. We found 181 significantly (q&lt;0.05) up-regulated genes in the Six1+Eya1<sub>m</sub> group, 149 in Six1<sub>m</sub> and 112 in Eya1<sub>m</sub> (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD3-data">Supplementary file 3</xref>, Tables 1–3). Substantially fewer genes were negatively regulated in these merged groups, with only 14 significantly down-regulated genes found in Six1+Eya1<sub>m</sub>, 11 in Six1<sub>m</sub> and 13 in Eya1<sub>m</sub> (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD3-data">Supplementary file 3</xref>, Tables 4–6), re-enforcing the notion that together, Six1 and Eya1 act primarily as transcriptional activators (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2C</xref>).</p></sec><sec id="s2-4"><title>Target genes of Six1 and Eya1 are implicated in sensory neurogenesis</title><p>Presumptive direct targets that were significantly up-regulated in our merged data set (Six1+Eya1<sub>m</sub>) were analysed using Panther (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib65">Mi et al., 2013</xref>) to examine the representation of genes grouped by molecular function (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2D</xref>). Transcription factors and protein binding together accounted for the largest fraction of up-regulated genes (53% in total), followed by enzymes (30%) and transporter molecules (13%), suggesting a developmental function of many of the genes up-regulated by either Six1 or Eya1. GSEA was then conducted using DAVID (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib40">Huang et al., 2009</xref>) on the sets of significantly up- or down-regulated genes in our merged data sets, as well as in various combinations of subsets of differentially expressed genes from our individual treatment groups (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s1">Figure 3—figure supplement 1</xref>). This analysis showed that genes directly up-regulated by Six1, Eya1 or Six1+Eya1 were highly enriched for terms associated with sense organ development, inner-ear development, mechanoreceptor differentiation, eye morphogenesis, neurogenesis and axon guidance consistent with their synergistic role in sensory development (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Grocott et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib90">Schlosser, 2010</xref>) and neurogenesis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib62">Maier et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib88">Schlosser and Northcutt, 2000</xref>).

Here, we combine this approach with high-throughput sequencing of tissue-specific RNA to identify several hundred novel presumptive direct target genes of Six1 and Eya1 in the PPE. We show that this strategy indeed recovers the majority of direct Six1 target genes known from previous studies, indicating its reliability. Our in situ and qPCR analyses of target genes predicted from the RNA-Seq screen also provided independent verification of selected target genes suggesting a low false discovery rate. Moreover, the expression of all genes selected for detailed analysis proved to be dependent on Six1 and Eya1 in the PPE, indicating that many genes our screen predicted as Six1/Eya1 targets are also functionally dependent on these upstream regulators in the PPE. A comparison of our data set with recently identified direct target genes of <italic>sine oculis</italic>, the <italic>Six1</italic> orthologue in the developing eye of <italic>Drosophila</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib45">Jusiak et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib44">Jin et al., 2016</xref>) also reveals that homologues to six out of the 12 <italic>sine oculis</italic> target genes identified with high confidence in <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib44">Jin et al. (2016)</xref> are differentially expressed in our Six<sub>i</sub> or Six1+Eya1<sub>i</sub> (and often also in Eya1<sub>i</sub>) treatment groups, viz. <italic>Six1</italic> and <italic>Six2; Eya4; Shh</italic>; various matrix metalloproteases (e.g. <italic>MMP9); Ets2</italic>; and <italic>Frizzled1</italic> and <italic>Frizzled4</italic>. This suggests that a relatively high proportion of Six1 target genes may be evolutionarily conserved.</p><p>Our finding that many of the presumptive direct target genes of Six1 or Eya1 are not up-regulated in the absence of CHX indicates that without blocking protein synthesis it is not possible to reliably identify direct target genes, presumably due to the existence of indirect interactions with such targets. We believe that this is one of the reasons why our findings differ substantially from the study of <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib108">Yan et al. (2015)</xref>, which analysed differentially expressed genes in <italic>Xenopus</italic> animal cap explants after overexpression of Six1 without first blocking protein synthesis. None of the transcription factors in our prioritised list was identified in the study by <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib108">Yan et al. (2015)</xref>; and we found none of the transcription factors differentially expressed in their study. A second likely reason for the discrepancy between the results presented here and in <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib108">Yan et al. (2015)</xref> is that, while we specifically analysed PPE tissue (presumably containing tissue-specific cofactors required for the activation or repression of Six1 and Eya1 target genes specific for the developing placodes), they analysed target genes in animal cap tissue, known to be composed of pluripotent cells.</p><p>Previous studies have shown that Six1 and Eya1 are essential for both the establishment of the PPE (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Brugmann et al., 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Christophorou et al., 2009</xref>), as well as for the subsequent development of placode-derived sense organs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib107">Xu et al., 1999</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib52">Laclef et al., 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib110">Zheng et al., 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Brugmann et al., 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib112">Zou et al., 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib50">Kozlowski et al., 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib87">Schlosser et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Ahmed et al., 2012b</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">2012a</xref>) but the mechanisms through which they act are poorly understood. The continued expression of both genes in almost all placodes developing from the PPE (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib86">Schlosser and Ahrens, 2004</xref>), combined with the observed deficiencies in derivatives from most placodes after loss-of-function of either Six1 or Eya1, indicates that they play a role in generic aspects of placode development shared by all placodes. Indeed, our data show that genes revealed as presumptive direct targets of Six1 and Eya1 were highly enriched for GO terms associated with neurogenesis and placode development. Our screen also confirms previous studies suggesting that Six1 and Eya1 synergistically regulate many genes in the PPE, and that the Six1-Eya1 protein complex predominantly acts by activating transcription (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib56">Li et al., 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Brugmann et al., 2004</xref>). However, we also find support for independent action of Six1 and Eya1 in the PPE, possibly in conjunction with other interacting partners (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Brugmann et al., 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Ahmed et al., 2012a</xref>). Surprisingly, we found <italic>Hox</italic> genes to be strongly enriched in the list of target genes activated by Eya1 only. This deserves further study since Eya1 has not previously been recognised as an upstream regulator of <italic>Hox</italic> genes.</p><p>It has previously been suggested (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib89">Schlosser, 2006</xref>) that a generic role of Six1 and Eya1 for all placodes could be implemented in two possible ways: (1) By the direct contribution to the activation of genes regulating developmental processes shared between different placodes such as proliferation, morphogenetic movements and neuronal or sensory cytodifferentiation; or (2) by direct contribution to the activation of genes defining the identity of different individual placodes within the PPE. Our data strongly suggest that Six1 and Eya1 act predominantly in the first rather than in the second mode. A large number of transcription factor encoding genes, including several <italic>Pax, Pitx, ANF</italic> and <italic>FoxI</italic> genes, have been implicated in conferring identity to individual placodes, or groups of placodes, within the PPE (reviewed in <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib89">Schlosser, 2006</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib90">2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Grocott et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib83">Saint-Jeannet and Moody, 2014</xref>) however only a few of these genes were recovered as targets of Six1 or Eya1, e.g. <italic>Gbx2</italic> (FC 1.7 in Six1+Eya1<sub>i</sub>) and <italic>FoxI4</italic> (FC 1.09 in Six1<sub>i</sub>). In contrast, we found a large number of genes encoding transcription factors with roles in neuronal/sensory cytodifferentiation but also other proteins with likely roles for the maintenance of proliferating progenitors (e.g. <italic>Cyclin D, RGCC</italic>), the regulation of cell adhesion and morphogenetic movements (e.g. <italic>EDAR, CXCR7, Protocadherin11, RhoV, Claudin3</italic>) and cytodifferentiation (e.g. <italic>Espin, Neurotrophin3</italic>).

Both Hes (Hes8, Hes9) and SoxB1 (Sox2, Sox3) proteins are known to keep progenitor cells in an undifferentiated state, and must be down-regulated for neuronal differentiation to proceed.

Among these are many promising candidates potentially involved in mediating the effects of Six1 or Eya1 on proliferation, morphogenesis and cytodifferentiation in developing placodes. This makes our data an invaluable repository of information for designing further functional studies on early sensory development in vertebrates. Finally, while our study focussed on the role of Six1 and Eya1 during sensory development, cell proliferation, morphogenesis and cytodifferentiation are also known to be affected in human patients in which Six1 and Eya1 are dysregulated, leading to sensory deficits after <italic>Six1</italic> or <italic>Eya1</italic> loss of function mutations (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib48">Kochhar et al., 2007</xref>) or enhanced tumour progression after <italic>Six1</italic> or <italic>Eya1</italic> up-regulation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Blevins et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib59">Liu et al., 2016</xref>).

Your article has been reviewed by two peer reviewers, and the evaluation has been overseen by K VijayRaghavan as the Senior Editor and Reviewing Editor. The following individuals involved in review of your submission have agreed to reveal their identity: Sally Moody (Reviewer #1) and Jean-Pierre Saint-Jennet (Reviewer #2)</p><p>The reviewers have discussed the reviews with one another and the Reviewing Editor has drafted this decision to help you prepare a revised submission.</p><p>Summary:</p><p>This is an interesting transcriptomic analysis of the direct targets of Six1 and Eya1 in the pre-placodal ectoderm (PPE). This is a very important analysis because both genes are critical for the development of cranial sensory organs and they are mutated in a human developmental defect, branchio-oto-renal syndrome. Although the role of Six1 and Eya1 in cranial placode development has been established for over 15 years, their direct transcriptional targets have not yet been analyzed in a comprehensive manner in a vertebrate model. This study uses techniques that have been very successful in <italic>Xenopus</italic> to detect direct transcriptional targets by expressing hormone inducible versions of Six1 and Eya1 in the presence of protein synthesis inhibitors. The authors have meticulously dissected out the precursor cells of the cranial placodes, the PPE, which provides important tissue specificity to the results. In addition, they make important comparisons between Six1 only, Eya1 only and Six1 + Eya1 targets. This is important because the literature shows in both fly and vertebrates that both proteins have alternate binding partners that can influence target gene specificity. This work is carefully carried out, includes appropriate controls and provides important new information for the community.</p><p>Some of the strengths/novelty of this manuscript are:</p><p>1) A comparison to a neural crest data set (Simoes-Costs 2014), which is interesting because it is a related but distinct tissue.</p><p>2) Inclusion of a Chx-treated only sample, which would identify genes that are expressed when repression is relieved.</p><p>3) qPCR validation of RNA-seq and excellent controls for the MO-knockdown experiments.</p><p>4) Confirmation of known Six1 targets based on the literature</p><p>5) Implication that Eya1 may not always act as a co-activator with Six1; this could be very important and explain some unexplained observations in the literature.</p><p>6) Solid evidence that Six1 works with other co-factors and Eya1 works with other partners in PPE development.</p><p>7) Potential role of Eya1 in regulating Hox genes</p><p>8) Comparison of the RNA-seq data to previously published microarray analysis.</p><p>Essential revisions: (These are all straightforward)</p><p>Our main concern with the manuscript is whether the authors have truly identified direct targets of Six1 and Eya1, as the title suggest. We are not sure based on the experimental approach used here, that the authors can make this claim. Direct targets cannot be defined just based on cycloheximide treatment experiments, especially since there is no indication of the efficiency of the treatment at blocking protein synthesis in this assay. Moreover, cycloheximide has been shown to alter gene expression on its own (see Sinner et al., 2004) – though the authors appear to have the appropriate controls. The identification and validation of Six1 binding sites in the regulatory regions of these targets would make for a much stronger case in favor of genuine direct targets. Until this is done, we suggest that the authors revise the wording throughout the manuscript by using terms such as &quot;potential direct targets&quot; or &quot;presumptive direct targets&quot;. While it is very probable their list of genes contain direct targets, it seems unlikely that Six1 and Eya1 directly regulate the expression of several hundred genes in the PPE as stated at the beginning of the Discussion.</p><p>As a way of validating the approach and the quality of the data, the authors searched for established targets of Six1 in their data sets, however some of these genes (<italic>Sox2</italic> and Atoh1) are also upregulated in the Eya1 samples (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s1">Figure 3—figure supplement 1</xref>). What does it say about these targets and the quality of the data if they can be regulated independently of Six1? This should be discussed.</p><p>While this group has the demonstrated expertise to identify the various placodal domains at different stages of <italic>Xenopus</italic> development, it would be useful in some instances to confirm the placodal expression domain of these targets using well-characterized genes expressed in the same domain or in adjacent tissues, either using double ISH or single ISH in stage-matched embryos. For example, the expression pattern of Hes2 at the neurula stage appears to be largely confined to the neural crest territory, but <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4F</xref> indicate that it is expressed in the posterior placodal region.</p></body></sub-article><sub-article article-type="reply" id="SA2"><front-stub><article-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.17666.031</article-id><title-group><article-title>Author response</article-title></title-group></front-stub><body><p><italic>Essential revisions: (These are all straightforward)</italic> </p><p><italic>Our main concern with the manuscript is whether the authors have truly identified direct targets of Six1 and Eya1, as the title suggest.

To clarify this issue we have now added the following sentences to the relevant section: “Moreover, <italic>Atoh1, Sox2</italic> and <italic>MyoD1</italic> were found both in our Six1+Eya1<sub>i</sub> and Eya1<sub>i</sub> datasets as expected based on the known coregulation of these Six1 target genes by Eya1 (Grifone et al., 2007; Ahmed et al., 2012 a; Schlosser et al., 2008). We suggest that overexpression of Eya1 alone may upregulate such genes in those parts of the ectoderm where Six1 is already expressed at high levels but Eya1 at relatively low levels in vivo.”</p><p><italic>While this group has the demonstrated expertise to identify the various placodal domains at different stages of Xenopus development, it would be useful in some instances to confirm the placodal expression domain of these targets using well-characterized genes expressed in the same domain or in adjacent tissues, either using double ISH or single ISH in stage-matched embryos.

This shows that Hes2 as well as the other genes are predominantly expressed in the PPE and not the neural crest at neural plate stages (even though some overlap with the lateral part of the neural crest cannot be ruled out based on our data). We also have added images of Six1 expression in stage-matched embryos as an additional row to <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s1">Figure 4—figure supplements 1</xref>-4 to facilitate comparison of expression domains.</p></body></sub-article></article>
