The link between SoC and risk of cancer has however rarely been assessed. We performed a cohort study of 46,436 women from the Karolinska Mammography Project for Risk Prediction of Breast Cancer (Karma). Participants answered a SoC-13 questionnaire at recruitment to Karma and were subsequently followed up for incident breast cancer. Multivariate Cox models were used to assess the hazard ratios (HRs) of breast cancer in relation to SoC. We identified 771 incident cases of breast cancer during follow-up (median time: 5.2 years). No association was found between SoC, either as a categorical (strong vs. weak SoC, HR: 1.08, 95% CI: 0.90–1.29) or continuous (HR: 1.08; 95% CI: 1.00–1.17 per standard deviation increase of SoC) variable, and risk of breast cancer. In summary, we found little evidence to support an association between SoC and risk of breast cancer.</p></abstract><kwd-group kwd-group-type="author-keywords"><kwd>breast neoplasms</kwd><kwd>cohort studies</kwd><kwd>prevention &amp; control</kwd><kwd>risk</kwd><kwd>sense of coherence</kwd></kwd-group><kwd-group kwd-group-type="research-organism"><title>Research organism</title><kwd>Human</kwd></kwd-group><funding-group><award-group id="fund1"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100002794</institution-id><institution>Cancerfonden</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>CAN 2017/322</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Fang</surname><given-names>Fang</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund2"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100006636</institution-id><institution>Swedish Research Council for Health, Working Life and Welfare</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>2017-00531</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Fang</surname><given-names>Fang</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund3"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100004047</institution-id><institution>Karolinska Institutet</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>Senior Researcher Award</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Fang</surname><given-names>Fang</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund4"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100004047</institution-id><institution>Karolinska Institutet</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>Strategic Research Area in Epidemiology Award</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Fang</surname><given-names>Fang</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund5"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100004543</institution-id><institution>China Scholarship Council</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>201806240005</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Hu</surname><given-names>Kejia</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><funding-statement>The funders had no role in study design, data collection and interpretation, or the decision to submit the work for publication.</funding-statement></funding-group><custom-meta-group><custom-meta specific-use="meta-only"><meta-name>Author impact statement</meta-name><meta-value>There is little evidence for an association between sense of coherence and risk of breast cancer.</meta-value></custom-meta></custom-meta-group></article-meta></front><body><sec id="s1" sec-type="intro"><title>Introduction</title><p>Health, by definition of the World Health Organization (WHO), is a state of complete physical, mental and social well-being (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">World Health Organization, 2014</xref>). The theory of salutogenesis was developed by <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Antonovsky, 1979</xref> to study factors that support human health and well-being, in contrast to ‘pathogenesis’ which studies factors that cause diseases, with a specific focus on understanding the relationship between health, stress, and coping. According to this theory, health is a lifelong and dynamic process of actively coping with a variety of stress factors one might encounter in life (i.e., stimuli), and, although stress is ubiquitous, people experience different health outcomes in response to stress.</p><p>Sense of coherence (SoC) is the essence of the theory of salutogenesis, defined as “a global orientation that expresses the extent to which one has a pervasive, enduring though dynamic feeling of confidence that (1) the stimuli deriving from one’s internal and external environments in the course of living are structured, predictable, and explicable; (2) the resources are available to one to meet the demands posed by these stimuli; and (3) these demands are challenges, worthy of investment and engagement’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Antonovsky, 1987</xref>). Accordingly, SoC has three components, namely comprehensibility, manageability and meaningfulness, and salutogenesis is greatly dependent on a strong SoC. Generalized Resistance Resources are one of the key determinants for SoC, consisting all resources that help a person cope and are effective in avoiding or combating a range of stress factors, including socioeconomic standing and social support (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Antonovsky, 1972</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Idan et al., 2016</xref>).</p><p>The theory of salutogenesis has been applied in different fields of health and medicine. For instance, a potential link has been suggested between SoC and different somatic diseases (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Flensborg-Madsen et al., 2005</xref>), including diabetes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Eriksson et al., 2013</xref>) and cardiovascular diseases (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Poppius et al., 1999</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Nasermoaddeli et al., 2004</xref>). Yet, little is known about the link between SoC and cancer development. Animal research has proposed stress as a contributing factor to the initiation, growth, and metastasis of cancer (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Lutgendorf and Andersen, 2015</xref>). In addition, human mechanistic studies have suggested various pathogenic processes (e.g., altered antiviral defenses, DNA repair, and cellular aging) as potential pathways linking together stress and oncogenesis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Antoni et al., 2006</xref>). However, evidence from previous studies on the association of stress with cancer incidence in humans remains largely equivocal (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Chida et al., 2008</xref>). One reason for the observed diverging results might be the highly heterogeneous definitions and measurements of stress of the existing literature (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Fang et al., 2015</xref>). In contrary, there is so far one study, to the best of our knowledge, that assessed the role of SoC on cancer development, and found an association between weak SoC and an increased risk of cancer during an 8 year follow-up, although not 12 year follow-up, of a population of middle-aged Finnish men (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Poppius et al., 2006</xref>). No study has addressed this research question among women and for female cancer. To this end, we took advantage of a mammography screening cohort in Sweden and assessed the association of SoC with the subsequent risk of breast cancer.</p></sec><sec id="s2" sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><p>In total, we included 46,436 eligible women (65.5% of all Karma participants) in the present study.

Our study represents the first attempt to date to examine the association of SoC with the subsequent risk of breast cancer.</p><p>The correlations noted between SoC and different characteristics of the women are consistent with results from previous studies, which found SoC to increase with age (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Poppius et al., 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Nilsson et al., 2010</xref>), and decrease with an unhealthy lifestyle (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Igna et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Midanik et al., 1992</xref>). We also found SoC to increase with number of births and years of education, which has not been reported previously. SoC was found to be lower among women with non-European ancestry, which is in line with a previous study reporting a lower SoC for immigrants than their local counterparts (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Erim et al., 2011</xref>), perhaps due to the challenge in sociocultural and economic adaptation among the immigrants. Finally, the internal consistency of SoC (Cronbach’s Alpha = 0.87) noted in the present study is also in line with previous studies (Cronbach’s Alpha ranged from 0.70 to 0.92) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Eriksson and Lindström, 2005</xref>).</p><p>To our knowledge, few studies have examined the link between SoC and risk of cancer. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Poppius et al., 2006</xref> reported a 52% higher risk of any cancer during an 8 year follow-up of middle-aged men in Finland, when comparing men with a weak SoC to men with a strong SoC. The risk increment diminished however when expanding the follow-up to 12 years, although a statistically significantly increased cancer risk was observed among older men (i.e., above 55 years of age at baseline) regardless of the length of follow-up (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Poppius et al., 2006</xref>). Our study is the first to examine the role of SoC on cancer risk among women and showed a null association between SoC and the risk of breast cancer development. The different study population (men versus women) and cancer outcomes (all cancers among men versus female breast cancer) might have contributed to the diverging results observed between Poppius et al and the present study. The role of SoC in other cancer types among women, in populations outside the Nordic countries, or among other age groups needs to be further investigated. The lack of association between SoC and risk of breast cancer does however not necessarily exclude a possible link between SoC and prognosis of breast cancer. For instance, a previous study has found higher SoC to be associated with a decreased risk of both breast cancer-specific mortality and all-cause mortality (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Lindblad et al., 2018</xref>).</p><p>The strength of the present study includes the large-scale population-based cohort design, the comprehensive information collected from questionnaires, and the complete follow-up through linkages to national registers, which reduce greatly the possibility of systematic and random errors. There are however also limitations in our study. In the SoC-13 questionnaire used in Karma, 12 out of the total 13 items were reversed as a result of restructuring answers. Reverse item bias may therefore exist in SoC scoring due to acquiescence, careless responding, or confirmation bias (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Weijters et al., 2013</xref>). However, this concern may be partly alleviated by the high internal consistency noted between the items. Our study used the National Cancer Register and INCA to ascertain incident cases of breast cancer during follow-up. As the accuracy and completeness of breast cancer registration have both been shown as excellent in the National Cancer Register (underreporting rate of 1.1% for breast cancer in women under 70 years) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Barlow et al., 2009</xref>) and INCA (underreporting rate of 0.1% compared to the National Cancer Register) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Löfgren et al., 2019</xref>), the present results are unlikely greatly affected by misclassification of outcome measurement. Similarly, the Total Population Register (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Ludvigsson et al., 2016</xref>) and Causes of Death Register (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Brooke et al., 2017</xref>) have highly complete information on migration and death, largely alleviating concern about loss to follow-up. Karma is a mammography screening cohort, with the participants actively attending mammography screening and willing to participate in the research cohort (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Gabrielson et al., 2017</xref>). In the present study, we only included Karma participants who have responded to SoC-13. Consequently, the participants included in the final analysis might differ from the entire female population in Sweden, for instance, in terms of socioeconomic status. As a result, caution is needed when extrapolating these results to all women in Sweden or to female populations outside Sweden.</p><p>In summary, based on a large cohort of Swedish women, we found little evidence to support an association between SoC and the risk of breast cancer.</p></sec><sec id="s4" sec-type="materials|methods"><title>Materials and methods</title><sec id="s4-1"><title>Study design</title><p>The Karolinska Mammography Project for Risk Prediction of Breast Cancer (Karma) cohort recruited 70,872 women who attended a mammography screening or clinical mammography between October 2010 and March 2013 at any of the four mammography units (Stockholm South General Hospital, Helsingborg Hospital, Landskrona Hospital, and Skåne University Hospital, Lund) in Sweden (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Gabrielson et al., 2017</xref>). Participants answered a comprehensive questionnaire, including SoC-13 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Antonovsky, 1993</xref>), at the baseline visit (recruitment to Karma). More information about Karma, including details of the questionnaires, is available at <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://karmastudy.org/">karmastudy.org</ext-link>. In this study, we included participants who had no prevalent breast cancer, were at the age of 40 to 74 years, and had completed at least two-thirds of the items included in SoC-13 questionnaire at the baseline visit. The participants were then individually followed up from the date of baseline visit, through cross-linkages to various Swedish national registers, using the unique Swedish personal identity numbers. The personal identity numbers were replaced with study specific identity numbers at the Swedish National Board of Health and Welfare before data were received by the researchers. The follow-up ended at a diagnosis of breast cancer (through INCA and National Cancer Register), emigration out of Sweden (through Total Population Register), death (through Causes of Death Register), or October 6th, 2017, whichever occurred first.</p></sec><sec id="s4-2"><title>Sense of coherence (SoC)</title><p>SoC was measured at baseline using the SoC-13 questionnaire (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="supp1">Supplementary file 1</xref>), which was developed by <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Antonovsky, 1993</xref> and validated in different studies (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Eriksson and Mittelmark, 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Holmefur et al., 2015</xref>). A total score of SoC was calculated by the sum of included items, with the scores of a few items reversed as needed. As SOC-13 has high internal consistency (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Eriksson and Mittelmark, 2016</xref>) (Cronbach’s alpha = 0.87 in our study), any missing value of a single item was replaced by the mean value of the other items if at least two-thirds of the items were answered by one single person (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Volanen, 2011</xref>). We categorized the total score of SoC as ‘weak’, ‘moderate’, or ‘strong’ according to the tertile distribution.

We also used breast density percent measured at baseline by previously reported STRATUS software (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Eriksson et al., 2018</xref>). Finally, to study different subtypes of breast cancer, we also obtained information on the tumor markers for women with incident breast cancer identified during follow-up.

We assessed the correlations between sociodemographic and lifestyle factors and SoC using linear regression models. We then used Cox proportional hazards models to assess the association between SoC and the risk of breast cancer. We first fitted a model not adjusted for any other covariables (Model 1). In a full model (Model 2), we adjusted the analyses for sociodemographic factors (age, ancestry, and education) and lifestyle factors (body mass index, smoking, alcohol consumption, and physical activity), and known risk factors for breast cancer including reproductive and hormonal factors (age at menarche, age at first birth, No. of pregnancies, No. of births, use of contraceptives, use of hormone replacement therapy, menopausal status), as well as family history of breast cancer, benign breast disorders, other malignancies, and breast density. We tested proportional hazard assumptions of the Cox models using Schoenfeld residuals and found no major deviation from the assumptions. To assess the potential temporal pattern of the association, we did a sensitivity analysis by fitting a flexible parametric model allowing for the effect of SoC on breast cancer risk to vary over time since study entry. We further performed a sub-analysis to assess whether the studied association would differ between subtypes of breast cancer using the full model. The statistical analyses were performed using Stata, version 16, StataCorp LP and R (version 4.0.2). We used a two-sided p&lt;0.05 to indicate statistical significance.</p></sec></sec></body><back><ack id="ack"><title>Acknowledgements</title><p>This study was supported by the Swedish Cancer Society (grant number: CAN 2017/322) and the Swedish Research Council for Health, Working Life and Welfare (grant number: 2017–00531); by Karolinska Institutet Senior Researcher Award and Strategic Research Area in Epidemiology Award; and by China Scholarship Council (No. 201806240005).

Your article has been reviewed by three peer reviewers, one of whom is a member of our Board of Reviewing Editors, and the evaluation has been overseen by a Senior Editor. The following individual involved in review of your submission has agreed to reveal their identity: Jitka Pikhartova (Reviewer #3).</p><p>As is customary in <italic>eLife</italic>, the reviewers have discussed their critiques with one another. What follows below is the Reviewing Editor's edited compilation of the essential and ancillary points provided by reviewers in their critiques and in their interaction post-review. Please submit a revised version that addresses these concerns directly. Although we expect that you will address these comments in your response letter, we also need to see the corresponding revision in the text of the manuscript. Some of the reviewers' comments may seem to be simple queries or challenges that do not prompt revisions to the text. Please keep in mind, however, that readers may have the same perspective as the reviewers. Therefore, it is essential that you attempt to amend or expand the text to clarify the narrative accordingly.</p><p>Given the present situation, we will give authors as much time as they need to submit revised manuscripts. We are also offering, if you choose, to post the manuscript to bioRxiv (if it is not already there) along with this decision letter and a formal designation that the manuscript is &quot;in revision at <italic>eLife</italic>&quot;. Please let us know if you would like to pursue this option. (If your work is more suitable for medRxiv, you will need to post the preprint yourself, as the mechanisms for us to do so are still in development.)</p><p>Summary:</p><p>Sense of coherence (SoC) refers to a person's psychological ability to properly adapt to stress and adversity during the life course. The scale was developed to measure how people view life and to identify how a person may use her/ his intrinsic resources to overcome difficulties while maintaining their health. It seeks to understand why some people remain healthy under stress while others become sick. The SoC concept has been widely used and there is evidence suggesting a link between SoC and several health outcomes including cardiovascular disease and diabetes. However, the association between SoC and cancer is less studied. In the current study, the authors examine the association between SoC and risk of breast cancer using data from a cohort study of 46,436 women recruited in the Karolinska Mammography Project for Risk of Breast Cancer (Karma). This well-conducted study did not show an association between SoC and breast cancer. This study represents a potentially valuable contribution to the literature on SoC and breast cancer. However, there are a few substantive concerns.</p><p>Essential revisions:</p><p>While the authors provide a brief explanation of the SoC, the theoretical framework is still underdeveloped, and the explanations and definitions are vague and unclear. The text would benefit from a more elaborated explanation of theory of salutogenesis and how it relates to breast cancer. In addition, the authors need to provide a more comprehensive definition of SoC and its three aspects of comprehensibility, manageability and meaningfulness, notably explaining more about the nature of the stimuli as mentioned in the paper. A clearer definition of Generalized Resistance Resources (GRRs) is also required.</p><p>In summary, the manuscript fails to highlight the theoretical importance of examining the link between SoC and breast cancer, except that previous studies' results have been mixed or that no clear relationship has been established for this association. It is unclear to the reviewer which aspect of this current manuscript can resolve the issues of the existing mixed results on this topic.</p><p>The analytical approach of the paper needs to be improved; we recommend that the authors run a sensitivity analysis without adjustment for life stressors, hours of sleep, and quality of life. This is for the following reasons:</p><p>• &quot;Sense of coherence (SOC) reflects a coping capacity of people to deal with everyday life stressors&quot;. Therefore, life stressors should not be adjusted for; the effects of SOC are likely washed away when stressful life events are included as confounders (over adjustment).</p><p>• Having a high SOC means that one is able to cope better with stressors in the surrounding environment; therefore, how stressed one feels is an inherent part of SOC and should not be adjusted for.</p><p>• Quality of life (QOL) is also typically assessed as an outcome of SOC, rather than as a confounder as this paper has done. The stronger the SOC, the better the quality of life (https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC2465600/). Please omit QOL from the confounder list in the sensitivity analysis.</p><p>• The study by Poppius et al. cited in the Discussion section did find an association with cancer in the shorter follow-up period of 8 years. In contrast to this study on SOC and breast cancer, Poppius et al. only adjusted for age, occupation, smoking, and alcohol consumption. In line with the above comments, the authors of the current study are over adjusting. Also, the Poppius et al. study combined all cancers and measured their association with SOC, so the endpoint is different. Hence, the differences in results between studies.</p><p>According to the SOC literature: &quot;Generalized Resistance Resources (GRR) comprise the characteristics of a person, a group, or a community that facilitate the individuals' abilities to cope effectively with stressors and contribute to the development of the individual's level of (SOC)&quot;</p><p>Table 1 – GRRs are part of the SOC concept, they shouldn't be separated from it (the authors should not assess the relationship between GRRs and SOC, because the former is part of the latter). Please change the title of Table 1 to &quot;participant characteristics associated with SOC&quot; or something along those lines. Better to show that you are assessing the relationship of SOC with sociodemographics, lifestyle factors, etc. (potential confounders), and dispense with GRR terminology.</p></body></sub-article><sub-article article-type="reply" id="sa2"><front-stub><article-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.61469.sa2</article-id><title-group><article-title>Author response</article-title></title-group></front-stub><body><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Essential revisions:</p><p>While the authors provide a brief explanation of the SoC, the theoretical framework is still underdeveloped, and the explanations and definitions are vague and unclear.
