body. The SCN clockwork is a self-sustaining transcriptional-translational feedback loop (TTFL) that in turn coordinates the expression of clock-controlled genes (CCGs) directing circadian programmes of SCN cellular activity. In the mouse, the transcription factor, ZFHX3 (zinc finger homeobox-3), is necessary for the development of the SCN and influences circadian behaviour in the adult. The molecular mechanisms by which ZFHX3 affects the SCN at transcriptomic and genomic levels are, however, poorly defined. Here, we used chromatin immunoprecipitation sequencing to map the genomic localization of ZFHX3-binding sites in SCN chromatin. To test for function, we then conducted comprehensive RNA sequencing at six distinct times-of-day to compare the SCN transcriptional profiles of control and ZFHX3-conditional null mutants. We show that the genome-wide occupancy of ZFHX3 occurs predominantly around gene transcription start sites, co-localizing with known histone modifications, and preferentially partnering with clock transcription factors (CLOCK, BMAL1) to regulate clock gene(s) transcription. Correspondingly, we show that the conditional loss of ZFHX3 in the adult has a dramatic effect on the SCN transcriptome, including changes in the levels of transcripts encoding elements of numerous neuropeptide neurotransmitter systems while attenuating the daily oscillation of the clock TF <italic>Bmal1</italic>. Furthermore, various TTFL genes and CCGs exhibited altered circadian expression profiles, consistent with an advanced in daily behavioural rhythms under 12 h lightâ12 h dark conditions. Together, these findings reveal the extensive genome-wide regulation mediated by ZFHX3 in the central clock that orchestrates daily timekeeping in mammals.</p></abstract><kwd-group kwd-group-type="author-keywords"><kwd>circadian rhythm</kwd><kwd>genomics</kwd><kwd>SCN</kwd></kwd-group><kwd-group kwd-group-type="research-organism"><title>Research organism</title><kwd>Mouse</kwd></kwd-group><funding-group><award-group id="fund1"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100000265</institution-id><institution>Medical Research Council</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>MC_U142684173</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Bafna</surname><given-names>Akanksha</given-names></name><name><surname>Banks</surname><given-names>Gareth</given-names></name><name><surname>Nolan</surname><given-names>Patrick M</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund2"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100000268</institution-id><institution>Biotechnology and Biological Sciences Research Council</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>BB/Z514792/1</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Bafna</surname><given-names>Akanksha</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund3"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100000265</institution-id><institution>Medical Research Council</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>MC_U105170643</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Hastings</surname><given-names>Michael H</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund4"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100000266</institution-id><institution>Engineering and Physical Sciences Research Council</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>C53561/A19933</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Dallmann</surname><given-names>Robert</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund5"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100000265</institution-id><institution>Medical Research Council</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>MR/N014294/1</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Vasilyev</surname><given-names>Vadim</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><funding-statement>The funders had no role in study design, data collection and interpretation, or the decision to submit the work for publication.</funding-statement></funding-group><custom-meta-group><custom-meta specific-use="meta-only"><meta-name>Author impact statement</meta-name><meta-value>A multiomic study reveals the role of ZFHX3 transcription factor in daily timekeeping with a combination of transcription factor and histone ChIP-seq and time-resolved RNA-seq in the mammalian central clock.</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta specific-use="meta-only"><meta-name>publishing-route</meta-name><meta-value>prc</meta-value></custom-meta></custom-meta-group></article-meta></front><body><sec id="s1" sec-type="intro"><title>Introduction</title><p>Circadian (approximately 1 day) clocks are internal biological timekeepers coordinating coherent 24 h molecular, behavioural, and physiological rhythms that are synchronized with changing environmental conditions across day and night. In mammals, the circadian clock mechanism consists of cell-autonomous transcription-translation feedback loops (TTFLs) that drive rhythmic, ~24 h expression patterns of canonical clock components (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib46">Takahashi et al., 2008</xref>). The primary TTFL involves rhythmic transcription of period (<italic>Per1</italic>, <italic>Per2</italic>, and <italic>Per3</italic>) and cryptochrome genes (<italic>Cry1</italic> and <italic>Cry2</italic>). Thereafter, PER and CRY proteins form heterodimers that act on the dimeric complex of CLOCK (circadian locomotor output cycles kaput) and BMAL1 (brain and muscle ARNT-Like 1) to repress their own transcription, which is mediated by E-box (<italic>CACGTG</italic>) <italic>cis</italic>-regulatory sequences at their gene promoters. A secondary feedback loop is driven by <italic>Nr1d1</italic> (<italic>Rev-erbÎ±</italic>), which is also directly transcribed through binding of CLOCK:BMAL1 at E-boxes. NR1D1 feeds back to repress <italic>Bmal1</italic> transcription by competing with a retinoic acid-related orphan receptor (ROR) activator to bind ROR response elements (RREs) in the <italic>Bmal1</italic> promoter. Along with this, CLOCK:BMAL1 heterodimers also trans-activate a series of clock-controlled gene (CCGs), many of which encode transcription factors (TFs) that regulate additional downstream programmes of gene expression (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Herzog et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Hogenesch et al., 2003</xref>).</p><p>At an organismal level, mammalian circadian rhythms are directed by the suprachiasmatic nucleus (SCN) of the hypothalamus, which synchronizes robust 24 h oscillations across peripheral tissues (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Hastings et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Hastings et al., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib44">Schibler et al., 2015</xref>). In the SCN, the cell-autonomous TTFL molecular clocks in individual cells are synchronized through intercellular coupling to form a coherent oscillatory network (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Herzog et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">Maywood et al., 2021</xref>). This intercellular coupling is maintained through several neuropeptide neurotransmitter systems, including vasoactive intestinal peptide (VIP), arginine vasopressin (AVP), and gastrin-releasing peptide (GRP) systems (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Brown et al., 2005</xref>), while Prokinetin2 (PROK2) serves as a pace-making element in the SCN (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">Morris et al., 2021</xref>). Moreover, zinc finger homeobox-3, ZFHX3, is a key TF in the SCN. It is highly expressed in discrete populations of adult SCN cells and exerts robust control over circadian behavioural rhythms. Intriguingly, while a dominant missense mutation in <italic>Zfhx3</italic> (short circuit, <italic>Zfhx3<sup>Sci/+</sup></italic>) results in a short circadian period in mice (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib41">Parsons et al., 2015</xref>), a conditional null <italic>Zfhx3</italic> mutation results in more severe behaviour with short circadian period and arrhythmic mice (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib54">Wilcox et al., 2017</xref>).</p><p>Given the crucial role of the SCN in orchestrating daily timekeeping in mammals, it is imperative to understand the role of ZFHX3 in regulating the molecular circadian clock, but, although the effects of mutations in <italic>Zfhx3</italic> are known at the level of circadian behaviour, its molecular functions that underpin daily timekeeping are not well-characterized. Therefore, we set out to assess systematically the function of ZFHX3 by employing a multi-omics approach in the SCN. First, we analysed the genomic binding pattern of ZFHX3 by conducting ZFHX3 targeted chromatin immunoprecipitation (ChIP-seq) of SCN tissue to identify the genomic scope of ZFHX3 and its potential mechanistic roles. Second, we implemented a detailed transcriptional profiling of the SCN in control and <italic>Zfhx3</italic> conditional null mutants using vibratome-based microdissection (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Bafna et al., 2023b</xref>). This allowed us to map the effect of ZFHX3 on tissue-specific expression of both rhythmic and non-rhythmic genes.</p><p>Overall, we have defined genome-wide occupancy of ZFHX3 in the SCN, showing that it is found predominantly around actively transcribed genes and is accompanied by modified histones and other SCN TFs. We noted that conditional (adult) deletion of ZFHX3 drastically modifies the SCN transcriptome by affecting genes important for circadian timekeeping, neuropeptide signalling and synaptic processes. An in-depth investigation on time-of-day dependent gene expression clearly highlighted loss of <italic>Bmal1</italic> rhythmic transcription along with aberrant 24 h oscillations for TTFL and non-TTFL genes. This change in rhythmic clock gene transcriptional profiles contributed towards a phase-advanced internal central clock mirroring the advance seen in the daily behavioural activity patterns of the null mutant mice. These findings reveal a pivotal and genome-wide physiological role for ZFHX3 in the maintenance of robust circadian timekeeping in the SCN and identify molecular substrates that underpin this role.</p></sec><sec id="s2" sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><sec id="s2-1"><title>ZFHX3 binds to active promoter sites in the SCN</title><p>Genome-wide binding of ZFHX3 was profiled in the SCN using ChIP-seq. Briefly, genomic DNA was extracted from C57BL/6J mice raised in standard 12 h/12 h light-dark conditions at two distinct timepoints; <italic>Zeitgeber</italic> time (ZT) 03 (3 hours after lights on) and ZT15, and subjected to ChIP-seq (âMaterials and methodsâ). The sequenced reads were aligned to the mouse genome and significant sites of ZFHX3 occupancy were assessed in the context of previously identified modified histone binding regions (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Bafna et al., 2023a</xref>) in the SCN. We found a total of 43,236 ZFHX3-bound sites, overlapping with approximately 22% of total modified histone regions in the SCN genome. About 60% of the ZFHX3 bound sites were found near promoters (â¤ 3 kb of transcription start sites [TSS]) and so would be likely to identify direct transcriptional targets of ZFHX3, whilst ca. 21% were in distal intergenic regions potentially involved in other modes of gene regulation.</p><p>When assessed in relation to modified histone binding, ZFHX3 sites fell into four categories. First, the majority of ZFHX3 peaks coincided with both H3K4me3 (trimethylation of histone H3 at lysine 4) and H3K27ac (histone 3 lysine 27 acetylation) occupancy (48.9% of total ZFHX3 peaks at ZT3, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="supp1">Supplementary file 1</xref>), and were focussed near TSS (TSS Â±3 kb) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1B</xref>). Since such sites are likely responsible for active transcription (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Beacon et al., 2021</xref>), the ZFHX3 occupancy in these sites highlighted probable transcriptional regulation by ZFHX3 in the SCN. Next, a subset of ZFHX3 sites (20.7%) were bound only by H3K4me3 (no H3K27ac) as illustrated at <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1C</xref>. These are indicative of poised transcriptional regulation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Calo and Wysocka, 2013</xref>) and were also enriched near the TSS. About 8.2% of ZFHX3 sites were bound by H3K27ac exclusively (no H3K4me3) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1D</xref>). These sites were commonly found at intergenic and intronic regions and suggestive of enhancer-mediated gene regulation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib56">Won et al., 2008</xref>). Finally, 22% of ZFHX3 sites were found to be devoid of modified histone binding and were also concentrated at distal intergenic regions (39.04%) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1D</xref>). Overall, the broad occurrence of ZFHX3 alongside histone modifiers near the gene TSS and at distal intergenic regions in the SCN genome suggests its crucial role in gene regulation potentially via promoterâenhancer interaction.</p><fig-group><fig id="fig1" position="float"><label>Figure 1.</label><caption><title>Genomic occupancy of ZFHX3 in the suprachiasmatic nucleus (SCN).</title><p>(<bold>A</bold>) Left: Venn diagram illustrating overlap of ZFHX3 peaks with histone marks, H3K4me3 and H3K27ac; right: table showing the number of sites co-occupied by ZFHX3 and histone marks.

The functional annotation of genes which were associated with ZFHX3 and both the H3K4me3 and H3K27ac histone modifications was found to be associated with neurodegeneration and axonal guidance, synaptic processes known to be important in the SCN (glutamatergic, GABAeric, and dopaminergic systems) and various signalling pathways. Importantly, they also included pathways involved with circadian entrainment and timekeeping (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1âfigure supplement 1A</xref>), highlighting the reciprocal intersection between ZFHX3 and the SCN cell-autonomous clock. In contrast, genomic regions cooperatively bound by ZFHX3 and H3K4me3 but with no H3K27ac, or sites with ZFHX3 alone, were found to be associated with genes involved in several fundamental biological processes such as DNA replication or MAPK signalling, but notably not circadian rhythm (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1âfigure supplement 1B and C</xref>). Therefore, it is plausible that ZFHX3 binds at the TSS and regulates actively transcribing genes, particularly those involved in tissue-specific functions such as daily timekeeping, while its occupancy without histone modifiers and/or at poised state regulates genes responsible for other basal functions. Interestingly, it is worth noting that ZFHX3 occupancy did not differ appreciably between the two timepoints tested (ZT03 vs. ZT15): ZFHX3 was seen to bind consistently at the same genomic loci (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="supp1">Supplementary file 1</xref>). This indicates that other factors/mechanisms confer temporal control to these sites whilst the presence of ZFHX3 is permissive to such <italic>cis</italic>- and <italic>trans</italic>-regulatory cues.</p><p>We next examined the signature DNA binding motifs/<italic>cis</italic>-regulatory elements occupied by ZFHX3, either alone or with specific histone modifications (H3K4me3, H3K27ac). As anticipated, this revealed an over-representation of AT-rich motifs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib41">Parsons et al., 2015</xref>). Notably, it also suggested co-occurrence of ZFHX3 with SCN developmental and maintenance TFs such as DLX (distal-less homeobox) and LHX (LIM homeobox) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib47">VanDunk et al., 2011</xref>) across the tested categories (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1âfigure supplement 1D</xref>). Furthermore, ZFHX3-bound sites were also enriched for non-AT-rich motifs such as the RFX family of TFs, which have been implicated in transcriptional responses to light in the SCN (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Araki et al., 2004</xref>). Interestingly, we noted enrichment of ARNT (bHLH) domains but only where ZFHX3 peaks were seen adjacent to H3K27ac and H3K4me3 (i.e., active promoters). This clearly points towards the possibility of shared binding of ZFHX3 with the circadian clock TFs BMAL1:CLOCK at E-boxes and highlights a point of interaction between the core TTFL and ZFHX3 in the regulation of circadian gene transcription in the central pacemaker.</p></sec><sec id="s2-2"><title><italic>Zfhx3</italic> knock-out affects circadian behaviour and entrainment of mice</title><p>To explore the contribution of <italic>Zfhx3</italic> to SCN function in the adult animal, we compared circadian wheel-running in cohorts of <italic>Zfhx3</italic><sup>Flox/Flox</sup>;UBC-CreERT2 mice that had been dosed with tamoxifen (gene deletion, +Tamoxifen group) with mice that had not been dosed with tamoxifen (no deletion genetic control, -Tamoxifen group).

Conversely, ~18% of gene expressed in the SCN exhibited daily rhythmicity under one or other condition. Of these, ~45% were not affected by loss of ZFHX3, whereas ~55% of rhythmic transcripts showed alteration in their daily pattern following loss of ZFHX3. Indeed, ~42% of rhythmic genes required ZFHX3 to maintain that rhythm, whereas ~2% of genes (403/20,521) gained rhythmicity in the absence of ZFHX3. Thus, ZFHX3 contributes, directly or indirectly, to a significant part of the daily rhythmic transcriptome of the SCN.</p><p>For each module, we compiled the gene list and examined the functional enrichment pathways. The genes that lost rhythmic transcription after the deletion of ZFHX3 (module 2) were seen to be involved in intracellular protein transport, signal transduction such as WNT-pathway linking circadian and cell-cycle processes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">Matsu-Ura et al., 2018</xref>), oxidative stress response, etc. (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s2">Figure 4âfigure supplement 2A</xref>). On the contrary, genes that gain rhythmicity (module 3) were associated with RNA processing, stress, and metabolic pathways. The genes that did not show any change in rhythmic expression (module 4) were found to be enriched for functional processes such as protein phosphorylation and de-phosphorylation, cytoskeleton organization, DNA repair, etc. Interestingly, only a tiny proportion (~1.8%) of the rhythmic genes showed substantial changes in their daily cyclic gene expression profiles (phase and amplitude, module 5), but these were primarily involved in circadian rhythm generation, entrainment, and CCG expression (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s2">Figure 4âfigure supplement 2B</xref>).

CCGs are basically genes whose expression is regulated by circadian clock factors (such as CLOCK:BMAL1) that are directly associated with the TTFL. Several CCGs like DBP (D site albumin promoter binding protein) show rhythmic transcription (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">Lopez-Molina et al., 1997</xref>), and in turn control expression of a repertoire of genes, generating a cascade of 24 h cycling genes in the SCN (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Herzog et al., 2017</xref>). In our mutant group, <italic>Dbp</italic> mRNA levels also presented an advanced peak (~1.66 h) with reduced amplitude (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5C</xref>). Another such TF- <italic>Creb3l1</italic> (cAMP-responsive element-binding protein 3-like 1), which has been implicated in intercellular coupling (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Bedont et al., 2017</xref>), showed a distinctive change in phase and amplitude. Therefore, the alteration seen in the rhythmicity index at the level of TTFL genes due to the loss of ZFHX3 was recapitulated in the diurnal expression of certain CCGs in the SCN.</p><p>Finally, we studied the effect of ZFHX3 deletion on the rhythmic pattern of intercellular coupling agents (neuropeptides), whose overall mean expression levels were significantly reduced (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3</xref>, <italic>Vip, Grp</italic>). Along with lowered baseline expression, we noted severe loss in 24 h rhythm for crucial SCN neuropeptides such as <italic>Avp</italic> (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4a</xref>), <italic>Prok2</italic> and <italic>Npy</italic> (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5c</xref>). For <italic>Avp</italic>, there was no apparent increase in daytime mRNA expression (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Arima et al., 2002</xref>), and the levels remained intermediate throughout the day. Conversely, for both <italic>Prok2</italic> and <italic>Npy,</italic> transcript levels were reduced to minimal levels, possibly resulting in compromised intercellular-coupling in the SCN.</p><p>The effects of ZFHX3 on daily transcriptional profiles therefore varied between different gene categories. Whereas rhythmicity of downstream, CCGs was either independent of ZFHX3 or required ZFHX3 to be sustained, core circadian function was sustained but with altered dynamics. Intriguingly, this systematic approach not only highlighted the genes that lost 24 h rhythmic oscillations, such as <italic>Bmal1</italic> and the neuropeptide <italic>Avp</italic> (module 2, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4A</xref>), but also identified genes that retained rhythmicity with changes in their waveform (module 5). Given the fact that ZFHX3 deficient mice do not lose rhythmic behaviour in a daily LD cycle (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib54">Wilcox et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2</xref>), but do exhibit a short circadian period or arrhythmicity in free-running (complete darkness: DD) conditions, we believe our targeted SCN-specific assessment unravels the vital role of ZFHX3 in the mechanistic regulation of the daily molecular clock.</p></sec><sec id="s2-5"><title>The state of the daily SCN clock in ZFHX3-deficient mice</title><p>In order to link the perturbations of the core molecular clock in the SCN of ZFHX3-deficient mice with their altered behavioural profiles, we used TimeTeller (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib48">Vasilyev, 2025</xref>), a recently established method to predict circadian clock phase alongside the parameter âThetaâ which provides an index of clock disruption from transcriptomic data (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib49">Vlachou et al., 2024</xref>). This approach allows one to assess the clock globally as a system instead of gene by gene. For this, an initial training model was built using the available Cre-neg and -Tamoxifen (n = 35, control) mice data (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6A</xref>). Cross-validation for the training model suggested that the model is informative and predicts the control SCN time well with a median prediction error of â0.08 h (95% CI â0.83, 1.33) and 0.50 h (95% CI â1.67, 3.00), that is, the difference between the TimeTeller predicted time and the known ZT of SCN collection (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6s1">Figure 6âfigure supplement 1A</xref>). This was further assessed by predicting SCN timing in an independent dataset of SCN RNA-seq (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Deota et al., 2023</xref>). Similar to the TimeTeller predictions for the control group, median prediction error was 0.00 h (95% CI â2.00, 1.33) for the ad libitum fed and â0.66 h (95% CI â1.83, 1.00) for the temporary night-time-restricted feeding groups. These are not distinguishable from the control SCN in the current study (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6B</xref>). Similarly, the clock disruption parameter theta is low (medians: 0.03, 0.03, and 0.04) as is expected for a fully functional and well-predictable circadian clock in all three control groups. Furthermore, TT clock functionality parameter theta suggests that +Tamoxifen SCN have a similarly functional daily clock compared to the control SCN (median 0.04 vs. 0.03 in controls; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6s1">Figure 6âfigure supplement 1B</xref>).</p><fig-group><fig id="fig6" position="float"><label>Figure 6.</label><caption><title>TimeTeller model suprachiasmatic nucleus (SCN) circadian clock in control and ZFHX3-KO mice.</title><p>(<bold>A</bold>) TimeTeller (TT) model build with the data of all 35 available SCN from Creneg and âTam mice.

Our current findings highlight the instrumental role of the TF, ZFHX3, in driving the daily timekeeping mechanism. By comparing the daily behavioural activity of ZFHX3-KO mice with the genetic matched control, we clearly noted an advancement in LD activity and shortening of circadian period in mutants. This finding is consistent with previous studies (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib41">Parsons et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib55">Wilcox et al., 2021</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib54">Wilcox et al., 2017</xref>) and prompted a detailed molecular investigation in the SCN. Through targeted ChIP-seq, we successfully demonstrated the genome-wide occupancy of ZFHX3 in SCN chromatin with 78% of ZFHX3 bound sites found to be co-localized with modified histones (H3K4me3, H3K27ac), and a vast majority of these concentrated near gene TSS. This provides strong evidence in support of the observed pervasive regulation conferred by ZFHX3 on the SCN transcriptome. That said, a considerable proportion of ZFHX3 sites were also seen devoid of joint histone modifications (H3K4me3+H3K27ac) and enriched for CTCF binding sites. CTCF is a ubiquitous DNA binding protein that has exceptional roles in genomic organization, chromatin looping, and gene regulation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Holwerda and de Laat, 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Kim et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Mach et al., 2022</xref>). This co-occurrence hints on the potential accessory role of ZFHX3 in modifying genome topology and chromosomal looping to bring about changes in target gene expression by regulating promoterâenhancer interactions (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib42">Pugacheva et al., 2020</xref>). Interestingly, along with CTCF binding sites, ZFHX3 sites were also enriched for other SCN-enriched regulatory factors; RFX, LHX, ZIC (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Araki et al., 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Hatori et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1âfigure supplement 1D</xref>), suggesting well-coordinated tissue-specific gene regulation.</p><p>Given the crucial role of ZFHX3 in daily timekeeping, we speculated a dynamic change in its genomic occupancy and compared the binding intensity of the TF at two anti-phasic (12 h apart, ZT3 vs. ZT15) timepoints (âMaterials and methodsâ). Surprisingly, we did not detect any differential binding site(s) between the tested timepoints, but rather noticed a uniform and coherent localization. This suggests that ZFHX3 belongs to a family of poised TFs, whose occupancy at regulatory sites does not change during the day, but could potentially act as a co-activator/mediator to modulate oscillating gene transcription. Indeed, in a recent unpublished study (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Del RocÃ­o PÃ©rez Baca et al., 2023</xref>), ZFHX3 was shown to be associated with chromatin remodelling and mRNA processing factors, strengthening the viewpoint as a co-regulator. It is, therefore, highly plausible that ZFHX3 occupies the targeted TSS and partners with clock TFs such as BMAL1 (<italic>CACGTG</italic>), as observed around active sites, to regulate rhythmic gene transcription.</p><p>Along with ChIP-seq, we executed detailed RNA sequencing to study the effect of loss of ZFHX3 specifically in the SCN. Crucially, ZFHX3 affected almost a third of the transcriptome in the SCN. An overall (time-independent) assessment of deletion of <italic>Zfhx3</italic> highlighted a significant impact on the expression of genes involved in several biological processes ranging from cellular differentiation to behavioural responses. We then performed a comprehensive time-dependent assessment to delineate the functional role of ZFHX3 in regulating the circadian timekeeping mechanism. We observed about 55% of rhythmic genes showed alteration at distinct levels in their daily transcriptional pattern following loss of ZFHX3.</p><p>At the TTFL level, ZFHX3-KO resulted in the loss of rhythmic <italic>Bmal1</italic> gene expression. It remains to be determined whether this is associated with changes at the post-translational level, given the findings by Abe et al where arrhythmic <italic>Bmal1</italic> transcript did possess posttranslational rhythm (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Abe et al., 2022</xref>), and could explain the subsequent 24 h-driven <italic>Per (1-3</italic>) and <italic>Cry (1-2</italic>) mRNA rhythms noted in our study. Likewise, in a separate study constitutive <italic>Bmal1</italic> expression has been shown to sustain rhythmic levels of transcriptional and translational products of <italic>Per, Cry, Clock, RORc,</italic> and <italic>Nr1d1</italic> by means of mathematic modelling (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">Mirsky et al., 2009</xref>). Arguably, clear circadian rhythmicity in BMAL1, CLOCK, or NR1D1 protein levels was not sustained in association with constitutive <italic>Bmal1</italic> levels under in vitro conditions (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib40">Padlom et al., 2022</xref>). Therefore, in future it will be interesting to study the daily abundance of protein levels of the clock genes in <italic>Zfhx3</italic>-deficient SCN, with its associated loss of <italic>Bmal1</italic> mRNA 24 h rhythm, to gain a complete understanding of the clock molecular circuitry.</p><p>Broadly speaking, aside from <italic>Bmal1</italic>, the majority of clock genes did not lose 24 h rhythmicity but showed an early peak in expression, ranging between ~0.4 and 2 h that perfectly resonates with the advanced rhythmic behaviour seen in mutants. In this case, it is difficult to delineate a straightforward cause-and-effect axis in terms of the direct targets of the perturbed ZFHX3 activity. Based on the current data, ZFHX3 is possibly partnering with CLOCK:BMAL1 to regulate the daily transcription of clock genes (<italic>Per, Ror, Reverb</italic>) and CCGs. Two possible scenarios could explain the noted effect on the TTFL genes due to lack of ZFHX3 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5</xref>). First, ZFHX3 preferentially controls <italic>Per</italic> family gene transcription (and not <italic>Cry</italic>) by binding at the promoter (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1</xref>). Loss of ZFHX3 affects the daily rhythm of <italic>Per</italic> gene transcription, and potentially PER protein levels, which in turn disturbs the CLOCK:BMAL1-driven transcription cascades. This leads to an aberrant daily transcriptional profile of the <italic>Ror</italic> (activator)/<italic>Reverb</italic> (repressor) genes as observed, which are known to control the amplitude and oscillation of <italic>Bmal1</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Liu et al., 2008</xref>), and further results in loss of <italic>Bmal1</italic> transcriptional rhythm. Therefore, the observed change in <italic>Ror</italic> and <italic>Reverb</italic> family gene expression levels could be reminiscent of the effect of ZFHX3 on the TTFL. In a second scenario, the constitutive expression of <italic>Bmal1</italic> mRNA could result from the primary effect of ZFHX3 on CLOCK:BMAL1-driven <italic>Ror/Reverb</italic> genes (affecting ROR/REVERB translational products), which does not disrupt the TTFL, but weakens the daily clock. The direct/indirect effect is seen in the cyclic expression of <italic>Per</italic> family genes, with relatively greater phase change in <italic>Per2</italic> and <italic>Per3</italic> than the <italic>Per1</italic> gene (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Kuhlman et al., 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5s1">Figure 5âfigure supplement 1</xref>). It is, however, noteworthy that the CRY family of genes (<italic>Cry1, Cry2</italic>) did not show any obvious change in the daily expression and is supposedly shielding the molecular clock, as recently postulated by <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Abe et al., 2022</xref>.</p><p>As previously reported (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib41">Parsons et al., 2015</xref>), lack of ZFHX3 also resulted in severe reduction in the SCN neuropeptides such as <italic>Avp, Vip, Grp, Prok2</italic>, which potentially compromises intercellular coupling and synchronization of circadian timekeeping. This universal effect, where loss of ZFHX3 does not deter a particular but all the key SCN neuropeptides, clearly points that (1) ZFHX3 is prevalent in almost all neuronal populations within the SCN, which are largely clustered based on their neuropeptide expression (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">Morris et al., 2021</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib53">Wen et al., 2020</xref>); and (2) potentially results in loosely coupled intercellular clocks that are still able to drive 24 h behavioural and molecular rhythms but with advanced phase. The prevalence of ZFHX3 in neuronal populations is also supported by a complete independent assessment in which almost 60% of the top 100 categorized neuronal genes in the SCN (as per single-cell atlas) were seen to be affected by ZFHX3 deletion based on the current dataset. In contrast, only 20% of the 100 most expressed genes in the astrocytic cell populations were impacted.</p><p>Along with this, lack of <italic>Zfhx3</italic> also leads to aberrant daily transcriptional rhythms of several CCGs, with the majority of them seen to lose daily oscillations. This could potentially result in hindrance of clock-regulated vital biological processes such as regulation of cell-cycle and metabolic pathways. Indeed, ZFHX3 is reported to be crucial for the development of a functional SCN (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib55">Wilcox et al., 2021</xref>) and could act as an âintegratorâ of afferent signals such as light and feeding to generate timely and robust physiological outputs. Moreover, genetic ablation of <italic>Zfhx3</italic> has been shown to result in a compromised light sensing mechanism in retina (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Hughes et al., 2021</xref>), while the missense mutation (<italic>Zfxh3<sup>Sci/+</sup></italic>) results in reduced growth and altered metabolic gene expression in the arcuate nucleus of the hypothalamus (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">Nolan et al., 2023</xref>) converging on its functional roles in other brain regions. The pleiotropic roles of ZFHX3 further extend in non-brain tissues with its recently described crucial involvement in angiogenesis for tumour development (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Fu et al., 2020</xref>), cardiac function (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Jameson et al., 2023</xref>), and spinocerebellar ataxia (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Figueroa et al., 2024</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib50">Wallenius et al., 2024</xref>). It is important to note that although in the present study we used adult-specific <italic>Zfhx3</italic> null mutants resulting in global loss of ZFHX3, the circadian effects observed both at molecular and behavioural levels are independent of its pleiotropic role(s) in other tissues. In the future, however, it will be beneficial to carry out the investigation using an inducible, SCN-specific genetically ablated model to circumvent any confounding effects. Regardless, the current research is of great importance as it not only maps the genomic binding of ZFHX3, but also demonstrates its critical association with both lineage- and clock-controlling TFs that perfectly resonates with the observed profound effects of ZFHX3 on the SCN transcriptome, regulating a vast majority of genes ranging from circadian timing to synaptic transmission and inflammatory responses. This highlights how ZFHX3 regulates the core-clock (TTFL) in addition to its control over CCGs in order to drive sustained transcriptional rhythms in the SCN. Given the extensive pleiotropy of ZFHX3, it provides a solid substrate to further understand the functional interaction of ZFHX3 in distinct tissues indispensable for overall health and fitness.</p></sec><sec id="s4" sec-type="materials|methods"><title>Materials and methods</title><table-wrap id="keyresource" position="anchor"><label>Key resources table</label><table frame="hsides"

Then, the reads were aligned to mm10 genome assembly using STAR (v2.7.8a) with MAPQ value for unique mappers set to 60. BAM files were used to generate read counts per gene by FeatureCounts via Samtools (v1.11). Finally, limma-voom method (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">Liu et al., 2015</xref>) from the Bioconductor package-limma (v3.48.0) was adopted to quantify differential gene expression and normalized logarithmic counts per million (CPM) values were generated for downstream analysis. Genes without more than 0.5 CPM in at least two samples are insignificant and filtered out. 8582 of 24,421 (35.14%) genes were filtered out for low expression. TMM was the method used to normalize library sizes.</p><p>To study the overlap between genes with ZFHX3 occupancy at TSS and those impacted by <italic>Zfhx3</italic> deletion, R-package GeneOverlap (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://bioconductor.org/packages/release/bioc/html/GeneOverlap.html">https://bioconductor.org/packages/release/bioc/html/GeneOverlap.html</ext-link>) was adopted where overlap between two gene lists was tested sing Fisherâs exact test with p-value=0, meaning the overlap is highly significant. Fisherâs exact test also gives an OR, which represents the strength of association. If an OR is equal to or less than 1, there is no association between the two lists. If the OR is much larger than 1, then the association is strong. The class also calculates the Jaccard index, which measures the similarity between two lists. The Jaccard index varies between 0 and 1, with 0 meaning there is no similarity between the two and 1 meaning the two are identical.</p></sec><sec id="s4-9"><title>Differential rhythm analysis</title><p>The read counts per gene (n=24,421) for each analysed sample were obtained by FeatureCounts and arranged in sample matrix using coreutils (v8.25).

In the current manuscript, the authors assess the function of ZFHX3 by using a multi-omics approach including ChIPSeq in wildtype SCNs and RNAseq of SCN tissues from both wildtype and conditional null mice. RNAseq analysis showed a loss of oscillation in Bmal1 and changes in expression levels of other clock output genes. Moreover, a phase advance gene transcriptional profile using the TimeTeller algorithm suggests the presence of a regulatory network that could underlie the observed pattern of advanced activity onset in locomotor behavior in knockout mice.</p><p>In Figure 1, the authors identified the ZFHX3 bound sites using ChIPseq and compared the loci with other histone marks that occur at promoters, TSS, enhancers and intergenic regions. And the analysis broadly points to a role for ZFHX3 in transcriptional regulation. The vast majority of nearly 40000 peaks overlapped H3K4me3 and K27ac marks, active promoters which also included genes falling under the GO category circadian rhythms. However, no significant differential ZFHX3 bound peaks were detected between ZT3 and ZT15. In these experiments, it is not clear if and how the different ChIP samples (ZFHX3 and histone PTM ChIPs) were normalized/downsampled for analysis. Moreover, it seems that ZFHX3 binding or recruitment has little to do with whether the promoters are active.</p><p>Based on an enrichment of ARNT domains next to K4Me3 and K27ac PTMs, the authors propose a model where the core-clock TFs and ZFHX3 interact. If the authors develop other assays beyond just predictions to test their hypothesis, it would strengthen the argument for a role in circadian transcription in the SCN. It would be important in this context to perform a ChIP-seq experiment for ZFHX3 in the knockout animal (described from Figure 2 onwards) to eliminate the possibility of non-specific enrichment of signal from &quot;open chromatin'. Alternatively, a ChIPseq analysis for BMAL1 or CLOCK could also strengthen this argument to identify the sites co-occupied by ZFHX3 and core-clock TFs.</p><p>Next, they compared locomotor activity rhythms in floxed mice with or without tamoxifen treatment. As reported before in Wilcox et al 2017, the loss of ZFHX3 led to a shorter free running period and reduced amplitude and earlier onset of activity. Overall, the behavioral data in Figure 2 and supplementary figure 2 has been reported before and are not novel.</p><p>Next, the authors performed RNAseq at 4hr intervals on wildtype and knockout animals maintained in light/dark cycles to determine the impact of loss of ZFHX3. Overall transcriptomic analysis indicated changes in gene expression in nearly 36% of expressed genes, with nearly half being upregulated while an equal fraction was downregulated. Pathways affected included mostly neureopeptide neurotransmitter pathways. Surprisingly, there was no correlation between the direction in change in expression and TF binding since nearly all the sites were bound by ZFHX3 and the active histone PTMs. The ChIP-seq experiment for ZFHX3 in the UBC-Cre+Tam mice again could help resolve the real targets of ZFHX3 and the transcriptional state in knockout animals.</p><p>To determine the fraction of rhythmic transcripts, Using dryR, the authors categorise the rhythmic transcriptome (about 7% in all) into modules that include genes that lose rhythmicity in the KO, gain rhythmicity in the KO or remain unaffected or partially affected. The analysis indicates that a large fraction of the rhythmic transcriptome is affected in the KO model. However, among core-clock genes only Bmal1 expression is affected showing a complete loss of rhythm. The authors state a decrease in Clock mRNA expression (line 294) but the panel figure 4A does not show this data. Instead it depicts the loss in Avp expression - {{ misstated in line 321 we noted severe loss in 24-h rhythm for crucial SCN neuropeptides such as Avp (Fig. 3a).}}</p><p>However, core-clock genes such as Pers and Crys show minor or no change in expression patterns while Per2 and Per3 show a ~2hr phase advance. While these could only weakly account for the behavioral phase advance, the authors used TimeTeller to assess circadian phase in wildtype and ZFHX3 deficient mice. This approach clearly indicated that while the clock is not disrupted in the knockout animals, the phase advance can be correctly predicted from a network of gene expression patterns.</p><p>Strengths</p><p>The authors use a multiomic strategy in order to reveal the role of the ZFHX3 transcription factor with a combination of TF and histone PTM ChIPseq, time-resolved RNAseq from wildtype and knockout mice and modeling the transcriptomic data using TimeTeller. The RNAseq experiments are nicely controlled and the analysis of the data indicates a clear impact on gene-expression levels in the knockout mice and the presence of a regulatory network that could underlie the advanced activity onset behavior.</p><p>Weaknesses</p><p>It is not clear whether ZFHX3 has a direct role in any of the processes and seems to be a general factor that marks H3K4me3 and K27ac marked chromatin. Why it would specifically impact the core-clock TTFL clock gene expression or indeed daily gene expression rhythms is not clear either. Details for treatment of different ChIP samples (ZFHX3 and histone PTM ChIPs) on data normalization for analysis are needed. The loss of complete rhythmicity of Avp and other neuropeptides or indeed other TFs could instead account for the transcriptional deregulation noted in the knockout mice.</p><p>Comments on revisions:</p><p>The authors addressed the majority of my criticisms. They also explained that some requested experiments are beyond the scope of the current manuscript, while others are technically not feasible. I do not have any further concerns.</p></body></sub-article><sub-article article-type="author-comment" id="sa3"><front-stub><article-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.102019.3.sa3</article-id><title-group><article-title>Author response</article-title></title-group><contrib-group><contrib contrib-type="author"><name><surname>Bafna</surname><given-names>Akanksha</given-names></name><role specific-use="author">Author</role><aff><institution>University of Oxford</institution><addr-line><named-content content-type="city">Oxford</named-content></addr-line><country>United Kingdom</country></aff></contrib><contrib contrib-type="author"><name><surname>Banks</surname><given-names>Gareth</given-names></name><role specific-use="author">Author</role><aff><institution>Nottingham Trent University</institution><addr-line><named-content content-type="city">Nottingham</named-content></addr-line><country>United Kingdom</country></aff></contrib><contrib contrib-type="author"><name><surname>Vasilyev</surname><given-names>Vadim</given-names></name><role specific-use="author">Author</role><aff><institution>University of Warwick</institution><addr-line><named-content content-type="city">Warwick</named-content></addr-line><country>United Kingdom</country></aff></contrib><contrib contrib-type="author"><name><surname>Dallmann</surname><given-names>Robert</given-names></name><role specific-use="author">Author</role><aff><institution>University of Warwick</institution><addr-line><named-content content-type="city">Coventry</named-content></addr-line><country>United Kingdom</country></aff></contrib><contrib contrib-type="author"><name><surname>Hastings</surname><given-names>Michael H</given-names></name><role specific-use="author">Author</role><aff><institution>Medical Research Council</institution><addr-line><named-content content-type="city">Cambridge</named-content></addr-line><country>United Kingdom</country></aff></contrib><contrib contrib-type="author"><name><surname>Nolan</surname><given-names>Patrick</given-names></name><role specific-use="author">Author</role><aff><institution>Medical Research Council</institution><addr-line><named-content content-type="city">Didcot</named-content></addr-line><country>United Kingdom</country></aff></contrib></contrib-group></front-stub><body><p>The following is the authorsâ response to the original reviews.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p><bold>Public Reviews:</bold></p><p><bold>Reviewer #1 (Public review):</bold></p><p>Summary:</p><p>Authors of this article have previously shown the involvement of the transcription factor Zinc finger homeobox-3 (ZFHX3) in the function of the circadian clock and the development/differentiation of the central circadian clock in the suprachiasmatic nucleus (SCN) of the hypothalamus.

Different ChIP samples (ZFHX3 and histone PTM ChIPs) were treated in the same manner from preprocessing (quality control by FastQC, adapter trimming, alignment to mm10 genome) and peak calling was performed using respective input samples as control using MACS2 as mentioned in Methods. The data was normalized using bamCoverage tools and bigwig files were generated for visual inspection using UCSC Genome Browser. These additional details are added to Methods at line 592. Finally, BEDTools was employed to study overlapping peaks between ZFHX3 and histone PTMs.</p><p>We agree that, alone, the current data does not make any claim for ZFHX3 being crucial for promoter to be active. Our data clearly suggests that a vast majority of ZFHX3 genomic binding in the SCN was observed at active promoters marked by H3K4me3 and H3K27ac and potentially regulating gene transcription.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Based on a enrichment of ARNT domains next to K4Me3 and K27ac PTMs, the authors propose a model where the core-clock TFs and ZFHX3 interact.

However, this is beyond the scope of the current study.</p><p>(4b) Again, conducting complementary ChIPseq in ZFHX3 knockout mice will strengthen the findings, but conducting TF-ChIPseq in a specific brain tissue such as the SCN (unlike peripheral tissues such as liver) does not only warrant use of multiple animals per sample but is also technically challenging and time-consuming to ensure specificity of the sample. For these reasons, datasets such as ours on the SCN are uncommon. Furthermore, in this particular context, we are certain that, based on current dataset, the ZFHX3 peaks (narrow) we observed were well-defined and met the specified statistical criteria mitigating any risk of signal arising from non-specific enrichment from open-chromatin regions.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Next, they compared locomotor activity rhythms in floxed mice with or without tamoxifen treatment.

In the current study, however, we used a separate cohort of mice, to focus on the behavioral advance noted in 24-h LD cycle and generated a more refined assessment. Importantly, these mice were also used for transcriptomic studies as detailed in Figure 3, which we consider to be a positive feature of our experimental design: behavior and molecular analyses were performed on the same animals.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Next, the authors performed RNAseq at 4hr intervals on wildtype and knockout animals maintained in light/dark cycles to determine the impact of loss of ZFHX3.

That said, the current dataset is in line with recently published ZFHX3-CHIPseq data by Baca et al; 2024 [PMID: 38412861] in human neural stem cells and Hu et al; 2024 [PMID: 38871709] in human prostate cancer cells that clearly suggests ZFHX3 binds at active promoters and act as chromatin remodellers/mediators that modulate gene transcription depending on the accessory TFs assembled at target genes. Therefore, finding no correlation in the direction of change in expression is not striking.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>To determine the fraction of rhythmic transcripts, Using dryR, the authors categorise the rhythmic transcriptome into modules that include genes that lose rhythmicity in the KO, gain rhythmicity in the KO or remain unaffected or partially affected. The analysis indicates that a large fraction of the rhythmic transcriptome is affected in the KO model. However, among core-clock genes only Bmal1 expression is affected showing a complete loss of rhythm.

However, given the mice were rhythmic (as assessed by wheel-running activity) in LD conditions, the observed 24-h gene expression rhythm in the majority of core-clock genes (Pers and Crys) is consistent with behavior data, and suggests towards an altered molecular clock with plausible scenarios as explained at line 439. That said, the unique and well-defined changes (amplitude and phase) observed as demonstrated in Figure 5 highlights a model in which ZFHX3 exerts differential control, for example in case of Per2 noted advance in molecular rhythm (~2-h), but no such change in Cry, presents an opportunity to delineate further the regulation of TTFL genes.</p><p>(7b) Line 294 revised as â âBmal1 demonstrating a complete loss of 24-h rhythm (Fig. 4A), and its counterpart Clock mRNA showing overall reduced expression levels (Supplementary Table 3)â.</p><p>(7c) Line 321 is referring to loss of Avp expression and the typo has been corrected from âFigure 3a to 4aâ. Thank you.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>However, core-clock genes such as Pers and Crys show minor or no change in expression patterns while Per2 and Per3 show a ~2hr phase advance. While these could only weakly account for the behavioral phase advance, the authors used TimeTeller to assess circadian phase in wildtype and ZFHX3 deficient mice.

The current data suggests ZFHX3 acts as a mediating factor, occupying targeted active promoter sites and regulating gene expression by partnering with other key TFs in the SCN. Please see point 6 for clarification. The binding sites of ZFHX3 clearly showed enrichment for E-box(CACGTG) motif bound by CLOCK/BMAL1 along with binding sites for key SCN-specific TFs such as RFX (please see Supplementary Fig1). Our data thereby shows that it affects both core-clock and clock output genes (at varied levels) thereby exercising a pervasive control over the SCN transcriptome.</p><p>For treatment of ChIP samples please see point 3. We followed ENCODE guidelines strictly.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p><bold>Recommendations for the authors</bold>:</p><p><bold>Reviewer #1 (Recommendations for the authors):</bold></p><p>- The early activity onset associated with a short photoperiod is a phenotype found in mice with a perturbed function of the SCN like Per2 mutant (PMID: 17218255), or Clock KO (PMID: 22431615). Such disruption of the SCN function also leads to a faster synchronization to day feeding (PMID: 23824542) or jetlag (PMID: 25063847; PMID: 24092737). Therefore, authors should study the synchronizing function of these mice to day feeding and/or jetlag.</p></disp-quote><p>(9) Please see our response to point 1.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>- The description of the negative controls needs clarification. While the &quot;Method&quot; suggests that both Cre- and Cre+ mice are treated with Tamoxifen, the text rather suggest that the controls are Cre- and Cre+ animals non-treated by Tamoxifen. Because of the potential effect of Tamoxifen on gene expression, Cre- treated animals are a required control.</p></disp-quote><p>(10) We thank the reviewer. As detailed in Methods, both Cre- and Cre+ mice were treated with Tamoxifen and compared. The text had been revised at line 212. In addition to this, another genetic control (-Tamoxifen) was also used (Figure 2 and 3).</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>- On line 486, authors wrote &quot;It is important to note that although in the present study we used adult-specific Zfhx3 null mutants resulting in global loss of ZFHX3, the effects observed both at molecular and behavioural levels are independent of its functional role(s) in other tissues.&quot; On what evidence is this statement based? Using global KO rather suggest a potential role of other tissues.</p></disp-quote><p>(11) We agree with the reviewer, but at line 486 we refer to the effects observed at circadian behavior and daily gene expression in the SCN to be independent of pleiotropic roles of ZFHX3 such as involvement in angiogenesis, spinocerebellar ataxia etc. We have revised the text.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p><bold>Reviewer #2 (Recommendations for the authors):</bold></p><p>It is not clear whether the behavioral experiments presented in this study were performed on a new set of animals - different from the cohort used in the Wilcox et al 2017 paper. For example, the proportion of total activity graphed in Figure 2C look strikingly similar to activity counts in Figure 3A in the prior publication (doi: 10.1177/0748730417722631)- down to the small burst in activity after ZT20 in the control (-Tam) group.</p></disp-quote><p>(12) The behavioral experiments presented in this study were performed on a completely new cohort of mice to those used in Wilcox et al.; 2017. The mice used for behavioral assessment. In the current study were later used for molecular experiments.
