evolution of finely tuned disguise strategies. While the theoretical benefits of predator camouflage are well established, no study has yet been able to quantify its consequences for hunting success in natural conditions. We used high-resolution movement data to quantify how barn owls (<italic>Tyto alba</italic>) conceal their approach when using a sit-and-wait strategy. We hypothesized that hunting barn owls would modulate their landing force, potentially reducing noise levels in the vicinity of prey. Analysing 87,957 landings by 163 individuals equipped with GPS tags and accelerometers, we show that barn owls reduce their landing force as they approach their prey, and that landing force predicts the success of the following hunting attempt. Landing force also varied with the substrate, being lowest on man-made poles in field boundaries. The physical environment, therefore, affects the capacity for sound camouflage, providing an unexpected link between predator-prey interactions and land use. Finally, hunting strike forces in barn owls were the highest recorded in any bird, relative to body mass, highlighting the range of selective pressures that act on landings and the capacity of these predators to modulate their landing force. Overall, our results provide the first measurements of landing force in a wild setting, revealing a new form of motion-induced sound camouflage and its link to hunting success.</p></abstract><kwd-group kwd-group-type="author-keywords"><kwd>acoustic camouflage</kwd><kwd>animal movement</kwd><kwd>prey-predator relationship</kwd><kwd>barn owl</kwd><kwd>bio-logging</kwd><kwd>hunting success</kwd></kwd-group><kwd-group kwd-group-type="research-organism"><title>Research organism</title><kwd>Other</kwd></kwd-group><funding-group><award-group id="fund1"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100001711</institution-id><institution>Swiss National Science Foundation</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>31003A_173178</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Roulin</surname><given-names>Alexandre</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><funding-statement>The funders had no role in study design, data collection and interpretation, or the decision to submit the work for publication.</funding-statement></funding-group><custom-meta-group><custom-meta specific-use="meta-only"><meta-name>Author impact statement</meta-name><meta-value>Bio-logging reveals that barn owls enhance hunting success by using man-made poles to silently approach their prey, emphasizing a link between predator-prey interactions and land-use in the agricultural landscape.</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta specific-use="meta-only"><meta-name>publishing-route</meta-name><meta-value>prc</meta-value></custom-meta></custom-meta-group></article-meta></front><body><sec id="s1" sec-type="intro"><title>Introduction</title><p>Predation represents one of the strongest forms of selection in nature (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Grant and Clarke, 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Cook and Saccheri, 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Cuthill, 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib56">Stevens and Merilaita, 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Hall et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Dawkins and Krebs, 1979</xref>). As a result, animals have evolved sophisticated adaptations to modify the sensory information they emit (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib56">Stevens and Merilaita, 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Brooker and Wong, 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib49">Ruxton, 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Garrouste et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Caro et al., 2014</xref>). Camouflage has been widely studied as an anti-predator defence, with mechanisms including background matching, disruption, and self-shadow concealment facilitating predator avoidance (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib58">Stuart-fox et al., 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib57">Stevens et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib50">Ruxton et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Ancillotto et al., 2022</xref>). Predators also show adaptations to reduce detection by prey e.g., in their color, markings, and/ or behavior (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">Pembury Smith and Ruxton, 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib61">Théry and Casas, 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib51">San-Jose et al., 2019</xref>). However, in general, predator camouflage is far less understood due to the challenges of simulating predation in controlled settings (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">Nebel et al., 2019</xref>) and observing predation attempts in the wild (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Morisaka and Connor, 2007</xref>). This has hindered our understanding of the evolutionary forces driving predator camouflage and explains why predator cues have yet to be linked to prey capture success.</p><p>Predation typically requires movements of a predator towards its prey, either during a pursuit or an ambush, which usually exposes chasing predators to detection (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">Pembury Smith and Ruxton, 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Anderson and McOwan, 2003</xref>). Indeed, motion makes individuals more conspicuous (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Hall et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib57">Stevens et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib48">Rushton et al., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib44">Regan and Beverley, 1984</xref>). But motion also produces sound through the generation of vibrations and turbulence (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Larsson, 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Clark, 2016</xref>), which can be detected by prey with acute hearing. Many predators alter their movements accordingly, for instance, by moving slowly during the pursuit, which may provide both acoustic and visual camouflage (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib49">Ruxton, 2009</xref>), particularly when combined with a background colour matching (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">Pembury Smith and Ruxton, 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Anderson and McOwan, 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib71">Zylinski et al., 2009</xref>). While the direct link to hunting success remains unclear (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">Pembury Smith and Ruxton, 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">Mizutani et al., 2003</xref>), selection should favour camouflage strategies that reduce sound emission in quiet environments. The resulting arms race may explain why many nocturnal species have acute senses of hearing, which they rely on to detect danger or prey (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib49">Ruxton, 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Gerkema et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib40">Popper and Fay, 1997</xref>).</p><p>The silent flight of owls is one of the most iconic examples of noise camouflage. Quiet flight is achieved through comb-like serrations on the leading edge of owls’ wing feathers that break up the turbulent air and minimize associated sound production (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib49">Ruxton, 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Clark et al., 2020</xref>). This should provide advantages when hunting on the wing. However, most owls also launch attacks from perches, which involves moving from one perch to the next as they approach their prey (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">Payne, 1971</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib47">Roulin, 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib60">Taylor, 2004</xref>). Landing also produces vibrations, and hence sound, with the intensity being proportional to the landing force (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib65">Wernli et al., 2016</xref>). In this dynamic sit-and-wait strategy, landing likely becomes a key element of the prey approach. We use high-frequency GPS and accelerometer data to investigate the landing dynamics of this sit-and-wait strategy in wild barn owls (<italic>Tyto alba</italic>). Specifically, we quantify whether the landing force varies with (i) the time until the hunting strike (i.e. hunting motivation), (ii) perch type (i.e. environmental context), and (iii) body mass, which varies between males and females (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib46">Roulin et al., 2001</xref>). Finally, we test the extent to which the magnitude of the landing force affects hunting success.</p></sec><sec id="s2" sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><p>We used GPS loggers and accelerometers to record high-resolution movement data during two consecutive breeding seasons (May to August in 2019 and 2020) from 163 wild barn owls (79 males and 84 females) breeding in nest boxes across a 1000  km² intensive agricultural landscape in the western Swiss plateau. Of these individuals, 142 belonged to pairs for which data were recovered from both partners (71 pairs in total, 40 in 2019, 31 in 2020).

But these predators also use a sit-and-wait strategy, with owls in this study achieving greater hunting success when launching attacks from a perch. Here, owls typically approach prey by moving between multiple perches. They must, therefore, avoid detection both in flight and as they land, as the benefits of silent flight may be negated if owls are detected during touchdown. We found that barn owls hunting from pasture poles reduced their landing force as they got closer to their prey. This suggests that soft landings are a novel form of acoustic camouflage, with predators reducing their motion-induced sound production in response to information on prey presence, which they gather as they move between perches in the final phase of the hunt. The landing force also affected the success of the subsequent strike, demonstrating the link between the predator camouflage and hunting success. However, the relatively low R-squared value (<xref ref-type="table" rid="app1table10">Appendix 1—table 10</xref>) suggests that hunting success is affected by additional factors such as prey behaviour, substrate type, and grass length (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Low-Décarie et al., 2014</xref>).</p><p>Owls appeared to vary their perch use in relation to their motivation to hunt. For instance, barn owls that landed on a perch 30–90 min before a strike may have done so without the immediate intention of hunting. This phase was associated with greater use of buildings and trees, which are much higher structures than poles. Owls may, therefore, preferentially use these perches to rest or gather information over a wider area. The shift in predominant perch type to pasture poles 5–10 min before hunting strikes appears to represent a shift to periods of active prey searching. In some systems, the choice to hunt from pasture poles may be driven by prey availability, as pasture poles may be embedded in hedgerows or areas with longer grass where prey density might be higher. However, this is unlikely to be the case in our system as pasture poles generally occur in the middle of short-cropped grass (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="app1fig2">Appendix 1—figure 2</xref>). Instead, poles may offer advantages in being close to the ground, enhancing opportunities for owls to refine their estimates of prey location, prey type, or size. Indeed, the opportunity to gather information from perches could help explain the greater overall hunting success in attacks launched from a perch, compared to hunting on the wing.</p><p>In birds, landings are primarily governed by the need to maintain flight control and minimize the risk of injury (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">KleinHeerenbrink et al., 2022</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Lee et al., 1993</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">Paskins et al., 2007</xref>),. For instance, Harris’ hawks (<italic>Parabuteo unicinctus</italic>) landing in controlled conditions postponed the stall until they were as close to the landing perch as possible (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">KleinHeerenbrink et al., 2022</xref>). Such a strategy could serve two functions in barn owls using sit-and-wait hunting; minimizing both the energy dissipated on impact and the associated sound production (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib65">Wernli et al., 2016</xref>). This raises the question of why owls would ever land with anything above the minimal force. To date, almost all studies have examined landings in controlled conditions (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">KleinHeerenbrink et al., 2022</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib45">Roderick et al., 2017</xref>), yet in the wild, birds are faced with a range of perch types and landing conditions. Perch characteristics are likely to play a pivotal role, as forces tend to be absorbed to a greater degree by compliant substrates (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Demes et al., 1995</xref>). In support of this, landings on buildings were associated with the highest mean forces, and higher forces than tree branches (<xref ref-type="table" rid="app1table4">Appendix 1—table 4</xref>), which would be more compliant, with the extent varying with branch type and diameter (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">Paskins et al., 2007</xref>). It was, therefore, notable that forces were lowest for landings on poles, which, like buildings, are rigid. However, poles occur in open habitats (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="app1fig2">Appendix 1—figure 2</xref>), providing a predictable landing surface that can be approached from all directions, facilitating control through optimal use of the wind vector. Landing force may, therefore, be influenced by the access options as well as the substrate type. There may also be greater incentive to reduce landing force on poles, since they are close to the ground and sound attenuates with distance (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Clark et al., 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib63">Wahlberg and Larsen, 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Larsen et al., 2017</xref>).</p><p>The biggest difference in landing force was observed between perching events and hunting strikes. Strike forces in our study are the highest recorded in any bird, relative to body mass, with maximal force reaching more than 34 times the body weight (100 N). This exceeds estimates previously reported for captive barn owls (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib62">Usherwood et al., 2014</xref>), and the kicking strike of the secretary bird (<italic>Sagittarius serpentarius</italic>) that reached an average of 5.1 times body weight (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib41">Portugal et al., 2016</xref>). Unlike secretary birds, whose kicking strength depends solely on the muscular power of their lower limbs, owls use the dynamics of their entire body in flight. While this likely minimizes the chances of prey escape, it is also associated with a potential risk of injury (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">KleinHeerenbrink et al., 2022</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib43">Provini et al., 2014</xref>). Our results likely underestimate the true peak forces, as acceleration was recorded at 50 Hz (for reference, data on force development in controlled car crashes are typically recorded at &gt;2 kHz). Nonetheless, our data can still provide new insight into the selective pressures that have influenced owl morphology. Indeed, the lower limbs of owls allow for the dual function of absorbing shock during pre-hunt perching and generating extremely powerful hunting strikes.</p><p>We find that males and females had very similar strike forces, despite their substantial difference in body mass. This indicates that there might be a selective pressure for a minimum strike force, which males may generate by increasing or maintaining their flight speed prior to a strike to a greater extent than females. Males had a lower flight speed during prey searching, most likely due to their lower body mass (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">Pennycuick, 2008</xref>). While the difference in flight speed was relatively small, slower flight could still have advantages in (i) providing additional time to localize prey, and (ii) enabling birds to manoeuvre into the strike phase (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Amélineau et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">Machovsky-Capuska et al., 2012</xref>). This may help explain why males have higher success when hunting on the wing. Males also showed greater hunting success than females in the sit-and-wait strategy. Here, a lower body mass could also provide advantages by facilitating lower impact, and hence quieter landings.</p><p>Given that sit-and-wait hunting is associated with higher success, why do male barn owls not use this strategy more (it was associated with less than 10% of hunting attempts)? Male barn owls engage in intense hunting activity in the breeding season, providing over 15 prey per night in our study. Our results showed that foraging duration increases with the use of the sit-and-wait strategy. Thus, the time required to capture prey appears to be the key element influencing the choice of hunting strategy in males. Females provide fewer prey items and the additional time required for sit-and-wait hunting may, therefore, be less of a constraint. Furthermore, sit-and-wait hunting may require less flight time and hence effort, which is likely to be particularly advantageous for females due to their greater body mass (and higher flight costs per unit mass).</p><p>In conclusion, we use high-frequency movement data to propose a novel form of acoustic camouflage and demonstrate that the magnitude of predator cues can influence hunting success (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">English et al., 2024</xref>). Minimizing landing force, and associated sound production is likely to be particularly pertinent for nocturnal predators, which operate in quiet environments and target prey with an acute sense of hearing (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Gerkema et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib40">Popper and Fay, 1997</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib64">Webster and Plassmann, 1992</xref>). Importantly, the ability to minimize landing force was modulated by the perch characteristics, providing a potential link between landing impact and habitat characteristics. This suggests there could be spatial patterns in the effectiveness of acoustic camouflage and, ultimately, hunting success. The availability of different perch types could, therefore, be an additional, and previously unrecognized, aspect of habitat and territory quality, and, in this case, one that is strongly linked to land-use practices.</p></sec><sec id="s4" sec-type="materials|methods"><title>Materials and methods</title><sec id="s4-1"><title>Study area and tag deployment</title><p>Data were collected from wild barn owls breeding in nest boxes across the Western Swiss plateau, an area of 1000 km<sup>2</sup> characterized by an open and largely intensive agricultural landscape (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Almasi et al., 2015</xref>).

Travelling flight was associated with smoothed VeDBA values &gt;0.1 g, and body pitch values &lt;30 °.

Successful provisioning hunts were further confirmed using nest box camera data when available and, in all cases, by manually checking that the GPS data matched the nest site to identify cases where the owls returned with a single prey for their offspring.

Sex was included in the model to control for sexual differences in foraging strategy as well as a sexual dimorphism in body mass (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib47">Roulin, 2019</xref>). The model included bird ID as a random intercept to account for repeated measurements of the same individual over multiple nights, and night ID (nested in bird ID) to account for repeated measurement of the same individual within the same night. The same random effect structure was applied to all the following LMs and GLMs as they were fitted to dataset of similar grouping structure. We also fitted a LMM of the landing force during hunting strikes (log-transformed). Fixed factors in the model included hunting success (a two-level factor: successful and unsuccessful), the hunting strategy (a two-level factor: perching and flying), and their interaction. Sex was also included as a fixed factor.</p><p>We next fitted a generalized additive mixed-effects model (GAMM) to assess how the landing force (log-transformed) varied between perching events. Specifically, we examined whether this was affected by the physical environment (perch type, wind), or motivation (owls can perch for long periods between hunts, and the most pertinent currency determining landing force may, therefore, vary between periods of resting and active searching). Time until the next hunting strike was extracted for every perching event and included as a continuous fixed covariable in the model. An interaction between a smoothed function of the time until the next hunting strike and perch type was also included, using a thin plate regression spline and the ‘by’ condition, with the number of bases per smooth term (k) set at a conservative value of 9. The sex of the individual, windspeed, and perch type (a three-level factor: pole, tree, building) were included as linear predictors in the model. The model included the random intercept effect of bird ID (included with bs=‘re’ in a smooth function).</p><p>Our GAMM of landing force showed that owls perched more softly the closer they came to the next hunting strike. To identify periods when there was a significant change in landing force, we calculated the first derivative <italic>f`(x</italic>) of the estimated smoothed relationship between the time to the next strike and the peak landing force, according to each perch type, to highlight significant periods of positive or negative relationships (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib55">Simpson, 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Becciu et al., 2023</xref>). Periods of significant change were identified as those time points where the simultaneous confidence interval on the first derivative does not include zero.</p><p>Finally, we performed a set of analyses to investigate how hunting success varied with sex and hunting strategy, and most specifically whether success might be influenced by the landing force involved during perching events. To study how hunting success overall varied with sex and hunting strategy, we ran a first generalized linear mixed-effect model (GLMM) with hunting success as binary response variable (1=successful, 0=unsuccessful). In this first model, the sex of each individual, the hunting strategy, and their interaction were included as fixed effects.</p><p>Then, we fitted a second GLMM with hunting success as a binary response variable to specifically investigate whether the landing force applied in the last perching events would influence the success of the following hunting attempts. Hypothesizing that landing force might affects barn owl detectability, we only selected hunting strikes that were immediately preceded by a perching event (hereafter pre-hunt perching). We also selected hunting strikes that occurred &lt;90 s after the last perching event to maximize the probability of capturing a response to the pre-hunt perching force. The threshold of 90 s corresponded to the lower tercile of the distribution of time differences between perching and hunting strikes. The fixed effects included in this second model were pre-hunt perching force (i.e the force applied during perching events directly preceding each hunting attempt), hunting strategy and their interaction. The sex of the individual, windspeed, and the interaction between sex and hunting strategy were also included as fixed effects in the model.</p><p>In birds, body mass usually influences flight speed (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">Pennycuick, 2008</xref>). We, therefore, hypothesized that the sexual dimorphism in body mass present in barn owls’ population might influence the speed at which males and females would fly when foraging on the wing. This could in turn impact on their ability to locate and target prey on the ground and, therefore, ultimately influence hunting success when hunting on the wing. To test this hypothesis, we fitted a second LMM with foraging flight speed as continuous response variable and the sex of each individual as fixed effect.</p><p>Finally, we fitted a LMM to assess how preferences of a given hunting strategy might affect barn owls foraging trip duration. The model included the foraging trip duration (min) as response variable. The model also included the frequency of use of the sit-and-wait strategy (number of hunting attempts in the sit-and-wait per trip divided by the total number of hunting attempts per trip), the total number of hunting attempts per trip, and the sex as predictors.</p><p>All statistical analyses were conducted with R 4.0.5 (R Core Team, Vienna, Austria), with RStudio (RStudio Team, 2020) as graphic user interface. LMMs and GLMMs were fitted with the functions <italic>lmer</italic> and <italic>glmer</italic>, respectively, implemented in the package ‘lme4’ (R package v1.1–27.1) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Bates et al., 2015</xref>) and we used the package ‘lmerTest’ (R package v3.1–3) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Kuznetsova et al., 2017</xref>) to estimate p-values. GAMM model was fit using the <italic>gam</italic> function from the package ‘mgvc’ (R package v1.8–34) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib69">Wood, 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib70">Wood, 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib68">Wood, 2004</xref>). For all models, linear predictors were centered and scaled to mean zero and units of standard deviation (i.e. z-scores) to ensure comparability among variables. We selected the optimal structure of the fixed component of each models using a multi-model selection framework ranking the selected models according to the Akaike information criterion (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Burnham and Anderson, 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Burnham et al., 2011</xref>), using an automated stepwise model selection procedure in which models are fitted through repeated evaluation of modified calls extracted from the model containing all the meaningful variables, corrected for small sample sizes (AICc) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib59">Sugiura, 1978</xref>). The final models were chosen as the best models among the candidate models within ∆AICc &lt;2, that was always relatively low (between 1 and 4) (see <xref ref-type="table" rid="app1table5 app1table7 app1table9 app1table11 app1table3">Appendix 1—table 3, 5, 7, 9 and 11</xref>). Additionally, we performed pairwise comparisons using the <italic>emmeans</italic> function from the package ‘emmeans’ (R package v1.6.0) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Lenth et al., 2021</xref>) to further assess differences between predictors level. Models were fitted, checked for collinearity between predictors, and assumptions were verified by visually inspecting residual diagnostic plots.

The R2 values are indeed small. It is however important to keep in mind that we are assessing the outcome of one specific behavior (i.e. landing force during sit-and-wait hunts) on hunting success in a wild environment, where many complex ecological interactions likely influence hunting success. Nonetheless, the coefficients (as reported in the results) show that for every 1 N increase in landing force, there is a 15% reduction in hunting success, which is substantial. In the discussion we also note that 50 Hz is a relatively low sampling frequency for estimating the peak ground reaction force.

Details of our methods of behavioural identification are provided in lines 385 – 429. There are two reasons why our results should not be limited by the sample size. First, we used the temporal sequence of changes in acceleration, and rates of change in acceleration data, which make the methods robust to individual differences in acceleration values. Furthermore, our methods for behavioural identification were not based on machine learning. Instead, we use a Boolean based approach (as described in Wilson et al. 2018. MEE), which is more robust to small differences in absolute values that might occur e.g. in relation to slight changes in device position.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p><bold>Recommendation for the authors:</bold></p><p><bold>Reviewer #1 (Recommendations For The Authors):</bold></p><p>Comment 1.

Can you compare the difference in landing force between males and females with similar body mass (females from the lower part of the distribution and males from the upper part)? Is there still a difference?</p></disp-quote><p>Thank you, following your comment we made some new analyses that clarified the situation around landing force involved in perching and hunting strike events between sexes. But firstly, we wanted to clarify why there is a difference in number of hunting attempts between males and females. During the breeding season, females typically perform most of the incubation, brooding, and feeding of nestlings in the nest, while the male primarily hunts food for the female and chicks. The female supports the male providing food in a very irregular way, and this changes from pair to pair (paper in prep.). The differences in number of hunting attempts between males and females reflects this asymmetry in food provisioning between sexes during this specific period. We specified this in the revised version of the manuscript (lines 164 – 174).</p><p>We also provide a new analysis to investigate sex differences in mass-specific landing force (force/body mass). We found that males and females produce similar force per unit of body mass during perching events. This demonstrates that the overall higher perching force in females (see Fig. 4C in the manuscript) is therefore driven by their higher body mass.

We specifically investigated the hypothesis that the force involved during pre-hunt landings, and consequently the emitted noise, influences the success of the next hunting attempt in wild barn owls. Factors such as prey behavior and micro-habitat characteristics surrounding prey (such as substrate type and vegetation height) are most likely to be influential but hard, or nearly impossible, to model. We now cover this in a more nuanced way in the discussion (lines 266 – 268)</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Comment 13.
