Curiously, independent transmission of homologous DNA to archaea, bacteria, eukaryotes, and viruses is extremely rare and often defies ecological and functional explanations. Here, we demonstrate that a bacterial lysozyme family integrated independently in all domains of life across diverse environments, generating the only glycosyl hydrolase 25 muramidases in plants and archaea. During coculture of a hydrothermal vent archaeon with a bacterial competitor, muramidase transcription is upregulated. Moreover, recombinant lysozyme exhibits broad-spectrum antibacterial action in a dose-dependent manner. Similar to bacterial transfer of antibiotic resistance genes, transfer of a potent antibacterial gene across the universal tree seemingly bestows a niche-transcending adaptation that trumps the barriers against parallel HGT to all domains. The discoveries also comprise the first characterization of an antibacterial gene in archaea and support the pursuit of antibiotics in this underexplored group.</p><p><bold>DOI:</bold> <ext-link ext-link-type="doi" xlink:href="10.7554/eLife.04266.001">http://dx.doi.org/10.7554/eLife.04266.001</ext-link></p></abstract><abstract abstract-type="executive-summary"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.04266.002</object-id><title>eLife digest</title><p>Living things inherit most of their genetic material from their parents, so genes tend to be passed on from one generation to the next—from ancestors to descendants. Sometimes, however, DNA is transferred from one organism to another by other means. These events, collectively called horizontal gene transfer, are fairly common in nature; genes have been passed between different species as well as between different groups of organisms. For example, genes that confer resistance to antibacterial drugs have transferred from one species of bacteria to another, and other genes have also ‘jumped’ from bacteria to plants or animals.</p><p>Now Metcalf et al. have studied a gene that first arose in bacteria and that encodes an enzyme called a lysozyme. This enzyme breaks down the outer casing of a bacterial cell: a step that is required for a bacterium to reproduce and divide in two. When Metcalf et al. searched for relatives of the lysozyme gene, they found copies in many other species of bacteria and revealed that this gene has been repeatedly transferred between different bacteria. Members of the lysozyme gene family have also ‘jumped out’ of bacteria and into other organisms at least four times. Metcalf et al. found related lysozyme genes in a plant, an insect, many species of fungi, and a single-celled microbe (called an archaeon) that lives at hot, deep-sea vents.</p><p>A gene family being spread this widely across the tree of life has not been seen before. Nevertheless, as DNA is a common biological language to all living things, it is likely that all the different species that have received a lysozyme gene might use it for similar purposes.</p><p>Metcalf et al. reveal that the lysozyme could be being used as an antibacterial molecule. The archaeon lysozyme can kill a broad range of bacteria; and when the gene was transferred into <italic>Escherichia coli</italic> bacteria, only the bacteria that mutated the lysozyme gene to render it useless were able to survive. Metcalf et al. also revealed that the archaeon microbe produces more of the enzyme if bacteria are present, which allows it to outcompete these bacteria.</p><p>These findings suggest that there may be a number of horizontally transferred genes that have antibacterial activity against a wide range of bacteria. Searching for these genes—particularly in the largely underexplored group of archaea—might reveal new sources for antibiotic drugs to treat bacterial infections.</p><p><bold>DOI:</bold> <ext-link ext-link-type="doi" xlink:href="10.7554/eLife.04266.002">http://dx.doi.org/10.7554/eLife.04266.002</ext-link></p></abstract><kwd-group kwd-group-type="author-keywords"><title>Author keywords</title><kwd>horizontal gene transfer</kwd><kwd>antibiotic</kwd><kwd>lysin</kwd><kwd>archaea</kwd></kwd-group><kwd-group kwd-group-type="research-organism"><title>Research organism</title><kwd>Other</kwd></kwd-group><funding-group><award-group id="par-1"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000001</institution-id><institution>National Science Foundation</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>DEB1046149</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Bordenstein</surname><given-names>Seth R</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="par-2"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000002</institution-id><institution>National Institutes of Health</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>R01GM085163</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Bordenstein</surname><given-names>Seth R</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="par-3"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000002</institution-id><institution>National Institutes of Health</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>T32GM07347</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Metcalf</surname><given-names>Jason A</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="par-4"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000001</institution-id><institution>National Science Foundation</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>DEB1134877</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Reysenbach</surname><given-names>Anna-Louise</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><funding-statement>The funders had no role in study design, data collection and interpretation, or the decision to submit the work for publication.</funding-statement></funding-group><custom-meta-group><custom-meta><meta-name>elife-xml-version</meta-name><meta-value>2</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta specific-use="meta-only"><meta-name>Author impact statement</meta-name><meta-value>Parallel horizontal gene transfer has spread a bacteriolytic gene family to all domains of life, and has bestowed a niche-transcending adaptation in recipients that must deploy antibacterial molecules to survive in a bacterial world.</meta-value></custom-meta></custom-meta-group></article-meta></front><body><sec id="s1" sec-type="intro"><title>Introduction</title><p>HGT is rampant among prokaryotes and phages and is an important mechanism for acquisition of new genes and functions (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib59">Popa and Dagan, 2011</xref>), including the shuttling of antibiotics and antibiotic resistance between bacteria (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Clardy et al., 2009</xref>). Instances of interdomain horizontal transfer of diverse genes between two domains of life or between viruses and their hosts are also increasingly documented (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib52">Nelson et al., 1999</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">Husnik et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Dunning Hotopp et al., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib76">Wu et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Gladyshev et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Bratke and McLysaght, 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Danchin et al., 2010</xref>). While a minority of these transfers have been functionally investigated, the biological activity, selective advantages, and ecological contexts of many interdomain HGT events remain poorly characterized (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Dunning Hotopp 2011</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">Keeling and Palmer, 2008</xref>). In comparison to these intradomain or interdomain highways of HGT (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Beiko et al., 2005</xref>), independent transmission of the same gene family to archaea, bacteria, eukaryotes, and viruses is extremely uncommon and subject to apparently rare events throughout the history of life (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib51">Moran et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib45">Lundin et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib41">Koonin et al., 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib48">McClure, 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib49">McDonald et al., 2012</xref>). When taken together, genome-enabled studies suggest that horizontal gene transfers (HGTs) are biased and experience a frequency gradient that decreases from within domain &gt; between two domains &gt; between all domains of life (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Bruto et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib77">Zhaxybayeva and Doolittle, 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib60">Puigbo et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Andam and Gogarten, 2013</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">2011</xref>). However, the fact that a large number of organisms from all domains of life have been artificially transformed with genes evolved in other taxa indicates that there is no fundamental obstruction to interdomain HGT when barriers to transfer are deliberately removed.</p><p>One significant question then is why do highways of intra- or interdomain transfers occur more frequently than transfers to all domains in the universal tree of life? There are at least two explanations. First, recurrent transfer of the same gene family may be limited by incompatible mechanics of gene transfer (e.g., transduction, transfection, plasmid exchange, isolation of eukaryotic genome in nucleus, separation of somatic and germline tissues in multicellular eukaryotes) between domains compared to within domains. However, the individual success of gene transfers between any two domains of life, for example archaea and bacteria (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib52">Nelson et al., 1999</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib71">van Wolferen et al., 2013</xref>), bacteria and eukaryote (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Andersson, 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Bordenstein, 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Gladyshev et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Danchin et al., 2010</xref>), and archaea and eukaryote (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Andersson et al., 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib66">Schonknecht et al., 2013</xref>), suggests that these barriers may be minimal. Second, the selective barriers against HGT of the same gene to multiple taxa and preservation of the gene through evolutionary time are multifaceted given the potential costs associated with HGT (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Baltrus, 2013</xref>), and that each recipient may not benefit from the trait conferred. In the case of selfish genetic elements, HGT provides a strong benefit to the gene itself, yet these genes can be detrimental to the host organism and select for the evolution of countermeasures to gene propagation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib74">Werren, 2011</xref>). Thus, it may be necessary for a transferred gene to confer a benefit to its new host in order to be stably maintained in the host genome over the long term. Given these evolutionary dynamics, there may be very few niche-transcending genes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib75">Wiedenbeck and Cohan, 2011</xref>), defined as genes that are useful in different physiological capabilities, cellular structures, and ecological niches, which repeatedly increase fitness of each recipient across the whole diversity of life and can be stably and repeatedly transferred between very divergent organisms.</p><p>Among the few putative cases, there is a pore-forming toxin domain that appears to have been anciently transferred between diverse lineages (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib51">Moran et al., 2012</xref>). However, the distribution of the transfer across the tree of life is unclear because archaeal sequences were not included in phylogenetic analyses due to low support values. Other candidate genes encode proteins involved in nucleotide metabolism, intramembrane proteolysis, or membrane transport, but the transfer events defy clear interpretations due to their deep antiquity in evolutionary time and the confounding issues of ancient paralogy (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib45">Lundin et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib41">Koonin et al., 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib48">McClure, 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib49">McDonald et al., 2012</xref>). Moreover, these transfers are often not functionally validated in the recipient taxa.</p><p>Here we demonstrate for the first time, to our knowledge, that a functional antibacterial gene family scattered across the tree of life in diverse ecological contexts. This bacterial gene encodes a glycosyl hydrolase 25 (GH25) muramidase, a peptidoglycan-degrading lysozyme that hydrolyzes the 1,4-β-linkages between N-acetylmuramic acid and N-acetyl-D-glucosamine in the bacterial cell wall. Typically found in bacteria (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Cantarel et al., 2009</xref>), the lytic enzyme classically functions in cell division and cell wall remodeling (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib72">Vollmer et al., 2008</xref>), while in bacteriophages they lyse bacterial peptidoglycan at the end of the phage life cycle (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Fastrez, 1996</xref>). Although members of the GH25 muramidase family have been noted in other taxa (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib42">Korczynska et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib53">Nikoh et al., 2010</xref>), extensive analysis of their evolutionary history and functions have not been undertaken. We hypothesized that the transfer of antibacterial genes from bacteria to archaea and to eukaryotes bestows a niche-transcending adaptation that overcomes the barriers against repeated and evolutionarily stable HGT of the same type of gene across the tree of life.</p></sec><sec id="s2" sec-type="results|discussion"><title>Results and discussion</title><sec id="s2-1"><title>A bacterial GH25 muramidase is present in all domains of life</title><p>During a homology search, we uncovered 75 nonredundant sequences (E-values ≤ 10<sup>−12</sup>) of a bacterial GH25 muramidase in disparate taxa across the tree of life, indicating possible HGT of a bacterial gene to both eukaryotic and archaeal species as well as to phages. Putative HGT events were identified in the genomes of the plant <italic>Selaginella moellendorffii</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Banks et al., 2011</xref>), the deep-sea hydrothermal vent archaeon <italic>Aciduliprofundum boonei</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib63">Reysenbach et al., 2006</xref>), the pea aphid <italic>Acyrthosiphon pisum</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">International Aphid Genomics Consortium 2010</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib53">Nikoh et al., 2010</xref>), and several species of fungi such as <italic>Aspergillus oryzae</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib46">Machida et al., 2005</xref>). We verified the presence of the lysozyme gene in natural populations of selected HGT recipients by PCR and sequencing of the GH25 muramidase domain (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1</xref>), including <italic>Aciduliprofundum</italic> field samples harvested from hydrothermal vents worldwide. We detected lysozyme genes in 9 out of 12 field isolates of <italic>Aciduliprofundum</italic> from deep-sea vents in the Atlantic and Pacific oceans, 5 out of 6 species in the plant genus <italic>Selaginella</italic>, and 8 out of 9 aphid species in the subfamily Aphidinae (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1-data">Supplementary file 1</xref>). However, it is possible that PCR-negative strains actually do possess lysozyme genes and were simply more divergent than could be detected with our primers. At the protein level, sequenced field isolate lysozymes were relatively similar to each other in each clade, with 74% pairwise identity (385aa alignment) amongst <italic>Aciduliprofundum</italic> sequences, 85.1% (203aa alignment) amongst three intact <italic>Selaginella</italic> sequences, and 87.3% identity (93aa alignment) amongst Aphidinae sequences, with more variable divergence between clades (full identity matrix available in <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD2-data">Supplementary file 2</xref>). We also found lysozymes in two additional WO phages as part of an ongoing next generation sequencing project of <italic>Wolbachia</italic> viruses (unpublished data).</p><p>To rule out spurious bacterial contamination in these genomes and to confirm genomic integration of the lysozyme gene, we employed direct sequencing of PCR products amplified using primers inside the lysozyme gene paired with primers outside the gene for <italic>Aciduliprofundum</italic> field samples and <italic>S. moellendorffii</italic>. Incorporation of the lysozyme gene was verified in all cases tested (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s2">Figure 1—figure supplement 2</xref>). Additionally, <italic>Aciduliprofundum</italic> samples were grown in strict monocultures as determined by 16S amplicon monitoring. Integration of the <italic>A. pisum</italic> lysozyme has been previously established (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib53">Nikoh et al., 2010</xref>). Flanking genes in the recipient genomes were non-bacterial on either side of the transferred lysozyme in each case (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1</xref>, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD3-data">Supplementary file 3</xref>), with two exceptions. A bordering gene in <italic>A. boonei</italic>, ADP-ribose-1”-monophosphatase (App-1), possesses both bacterial and archaeal homologs and a phylogenetic analysis suggests HGT unrelated to the lysozyme transfer (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s3">Figure 1—figure supplement 3A</xref>). This transfer was likely between archaea and Thermotogae bacteria. The second exception is a GH2 hydrolase gene adjacent to the lysozyme in <italic>A. oryzae</italic>. This hydrolase has bacterial homologs in the phylum Actinobacteria, and recapitulates the same phylogenetic pattern seen in the GH25 muramidase (see below, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s3">Figure 1—figure supplement 3B</xref>). Thus, it is likely that the lysozyme and GH2 hydrolase were transferred to fungi in a single event. GH2 hydrolases have a number of carbohydrate-degrading enzymatic abilities (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Cantarel et al., 2009</xref>), including β-galactosidase, β-mannosidase, and β-glucuronidase activities, suggesting that this gene may benefit the fungi by adding additional digestive/nutritive capabilities in Dikarya.<fig-group><fig id="fig1" position="float"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.04266.003</object-id><label>Figure 1.</label><caption><title>Architecture of HGT candidates and surrounding genes.</title><p>Each arrow represents an open reading frame transcribed from either the plus strand (arrow pointing right) or the minus strand (arrow pointing left).

In this hypothetical tree consistent with the tree of life, lineage relationships within the bacterial and nonbacterial groups were permissively set as unconstrained. Results indicate that the hypothetical tree is significantly worse than the HGT tree, as expected (p&lt;0.01, D(LH) = −133.9, SD = 31.5). We repeated this analysis with the hypothetical tree compared to 100 randomly sampled HGT trees from maximum likelihood bootstrapping and found the hypothetical tree was also worse than each of these trees (p&lt;0.01). Finally, we performed SH tests between the HGT tree and either 1) a three-domain constraint tree or 2) a monophyletic eukaryote branch constraint tree, and again found that the constraint trees were significantly worse than the HGT tree (p&lt;0.01). Thus, the null hypothesis of vertical descent is rejected, even under the most permissive conditions.</p><p>We observed that each interdomain HGT event (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2</xref>) occurred between taxa that coexist in the same ecological niche, a likely prerequisite for HGT. For instance, the <italic>A. boonei</italic> lysozyme is in a clade dominated by Firmicutes whose members can be common in deep ocean sediments (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib56">Orcutt et al., 2011a</xref>). Indeed, <italic>Bacillus</italic> species have even been found in hydrothermal vents of the same fields in which <italic>Aciduliprofundum</italic> strains were isolated (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib62">Reysenbach et al., 2000</xref>). The <italic>A. pisum</italic> lysozyme clade includes <italic>Wolbachia</italic> prophages and Proteobacteria, which are common endosymbionts of aphids and other insects (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">Gomez-Valero et al., 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Augustinos et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib73">Wang et al., 2014</xref>). The <italic>S. moellendorffii</italic> plant lysozyme is closely related to Actinobacteria, which are dominant microbes in soil (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Bulgarelli et al., 2013</xref>). These associations, while not proof of HGT, establish interactions that may have facilitated the transfers, although any number of intermediate gene carriers is possible. While the phylogenetic pattern of the GH25 muramidase found in fungi is consistent with HGT (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2A</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s2">Figure 2—figure supplement 2</xref>), the transfer occurred anciently in fungal evolution prior to the divergence of Dikarya, as the domain is present in both Basidiomycota and Ascomycota, but not other fungal phyla. As is the case with most putative ancient transfers, the deep branches of the tree are poorly supported and a definitive donor taxon cannot be established. Additionally, the possibility of multiple ancient transfers between bacteria and fungi or among fungi and plants cannot be excluded. However, a nucleotide-level phylogeny also supports HGT from an ancestral Actinobacterium (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s3">Figure 2—figure supplement 3</xref>).</p><p>Interestingly, the lysozyme gene in the aphid <italic>A. pisum</italic> consists of a fusion of a bacterial GH25 muramidase domain and a eukaryotic carboxypeptidase domain. The gene includes five introns (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib53">Nikoh et al., 2010</xref>), none of which interrupt the GH25 domain, consistent with a relatively recent HGT event and the absence of the gene from most sequenced insects (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1</xref>). The lysozyme in the fungus <italic>A. oryzae</italic>, meanwhile, contains only a single intron, but it does interrupt the GH25 domain, consistent with the domain’s long association with fungi from the subkingdom Dikarya (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1</xref>). We found no evidence of a GH25 muramidase in 323 sequenced archaeal genomes spanning all the major phyla and sister taxa to <italic>A. boonei</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib63">Reysenbach et al., 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Flores et al., 2012</xref>). This lack of homology does not appear to be due to insufficient representation of archaeal diversity, as the 323 members span all of the major phyla: Crenarchaeota (56), Euryarchaeota (205), Nanoarchaeota (10), and Thaumarchaeota (39). Indeed, if vertical descent were assumed for a recent Bayesian phylogeny of archaea with sequenced genomes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Brochier-Armanet et al., 2011</xref>), this would require at least 10 independent losses of the lysozyme gene, an assumption that is certainly less parsimonious than a single HGT event. Moreover, the relative divergence of the small subunit rRNA gene in <italic>A. boonei</italic> compared to the putative bacterial HGT donors is greater than the relative divergence of the lysozyme gene (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4</xref>), a finding that is inconsistent with both genes being transmitted by vertical descent. Also, there are no other homologs beyond those presented in this study in 132 plant genomes, and only one insect species with additional homologs out of 109 insect genomes. Thus, if the lysozyme were present in the last common ancestor of all domains, it would require the unlikely loss of the gene in dozens of lineages while maintaining it in an exceedingly small number of species. In summary, the presence of a GH25 muramidase in nonbacterial species represents a series of recurrent, independent horizontal gene transfer events derived from diverse, ecologically associated bacteria.<fig id="fig4" position="float"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.04266.012</object-id><label>Figure 4.</label><caption><title>Comparison of GH25 muramidase and rRNA divergence.</title><p>(<bold>A</bold>) Unrooted Bayesian phylogeny of the GH25 muramidase from <italic>A. boonei</italic> and selected relatives, based on an alignment of 185aa without indels.

This difference is marginally non-significant, perhaps due to low sample sizes (p = 0.11, N = 5, MWU two-tailed test).

Indeed, HGTs have been described between each domain including archaea and bacteria (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib52">Nelson et al., 1999</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib71">van Wolferen et al., 2013</xref>), bacteria and eukaryote (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Andersson, 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Bordenstein, 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Gladyshev et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Danchin et al., 2010</xref>), and archaea and eukaryote (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Andersson et al., 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib66">Schonknecht et al., 2013</xref>). Despite these cases and others (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Brown, 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib77">Zhaxybayeva and Doolittle, 2011</xref>), HGTs are not without limits and often succumb to the selective costs of genomic rearrangements, cytotoxic effects, disruptive insertions, and functional inefficiencies upon integration (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Baltrus, 2013</xref>).</p><p>It follows then that HGTs do not occur at equal rates across the universal tree, but rather experience preferential routes in which the costs of HGT are easier to overcome. The resulting pattern of HGT can be understood as a gradient of decreasing frequency from within domain &gt; between two domains &gt; between all domains of life (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Bruto et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib77">Zhaxybayeva and Doolittle, 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib60">Puigbo et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Andam and Gogarten, 2011</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">2013</xref>). In support of this pattern, the overwhelming evidence of gene transfers between bacteria is counterbalanced by the extreme lack of parallel gene transfers across all extant groups of life. As these parallel transfers are usually ancient and occur in non-model organisms (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib45">Lundin et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib41">Koonin et al., 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib48">McClure, 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib49">McDonald et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib51">Moran et al., 2012</xref>), they can defy clear interpretations due to their deep antiquity and lack of functional validation.</p><p>One feature that parallel HGTs have in common is that the gene's phenotype must transcend different physiological capabilities, cellular structures, and ecological niches to repeatedly increase the fitness of each recipient across the whole diversity of life. While not traditionally used in the context of parallel HGT across all cellular domains, the term niche-transcending gene appropriately captures these conditions (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib75">Wiedenbeck and Cohan, 2011</xref>). The lysozyme gene family we describe in archaea, bacteria, eukaryotes, and viruses provides one such example because the adaptive benefit of an antibacterial muramidase has repeatedly surmounted the obstacles against recurrent HGT. Indeed, horizontally transferred homologs of the GH25 muramidase exhibit differential tissue expression in <italic>A. pisum</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib53">Nikoh et al., 2010</xref>) and bacteriolytic activity in the fungus <italic>Aspergillus nidulans</italic> (AN6470.2) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Bauer et al., 2006</xref>). Thus, the horizontally transferred homologs in eukaryotes confer the same transcriptional and enzymatic activity as in the archaea.</p><p>The muramidase in a thermophilic archaeon is of special note as archaea do not possess murein cell walls (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Albers and Meyer, 2011</xref>), and genes encoding an antibacterial peptide have never before been identified (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Cantarel et al., 2009</xref>). Members of the genus <italic>Aciduliprofundum</italic> are widespread thermoacidophiles in deep-sea hydrothermal vent chimney biofilms (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Flores et al., 2012</xref>) in which bacteria are frequent inhabitants (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib56">Orcutt et al., 2011a</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib50">Miroshnichenko and Bonch-Osmolovskaya 2006</xref>), including the <italic>M. lauensis</italic> species tested above. Archaea have been largely ignored in the context of antibiotic discovery, likely because of the conjecture that archaea do not compete with bacteria in nature. However, given that they coexist with diverse bacterial species in the environment (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib58">Oren, 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">Kato and Watanabe, 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib57">Orcutt et al., 2011b</xref>) and can compete for similar resources, there may be significant, unexploited potential for antibiotics in this domain. Only a handful of antimicrobial peptides produced by archaea have been characterized, and those are active only against other archaea (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib55">O'Connor and Shand 2002</xref>) despite the fact that archaea are known to inhibit bacteria in diverse environments (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Atanasova et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib67">Shand and Levya, 2008</xref>). It is also possible that since <italic>Aciduliprofundum</italic> strains metabolize peptides, the lysozyme enables a nutritive strategy in which lysed bacteria provide nutrients for the archaeon to scavenge.</p><p>Based on this work, we suspect that systematic surveys of archaeal gene products will likely uncover a broad range of antibacterial activities, and may eventually offer novel peptide or small molecule therapeutics. Such antibacterial products may have naturally evolved thermostability that would increase their attractiveness as therapeutics. GH25 muramidases have been demonstrated as effective antibacterials against biofilms of <italic>Streptococcus pneumoniae</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Domenech et al., 2011</xref>) and related enzymes have proven efficacious in mouse models of bacterial mucosal colonization (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Fenton et al., 2010</xref>), sepsis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib44">Loeffler et al., 2003</xref>), and endocarditis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Entenza et al., 2005</xref>).</p><p>In summary, we infer that the evolutionary path to this parallel HGT was paved by the universal drive for nonbacterial taxa to compete in a bacterial world. We predict that similar to the cascade of antibiotic gene transfer discoveries that followed their initial reporting, parallel transfers of genes to all cellular domains and viruses might regularly have antimicrobial functions.</p></sec></sec><sec id="s3" sec-type="materials|methods"><title>Materials and methods</title><p>Unless otherwise stated, reagents were obtained from Fisher Scientific (Waltham, WI).</p><sec id="s3-1"><title>PCR and sequencing</title><p>PCR was performed using GoTaq DNA Polymerase (Promega, Madison, WI) with primers listed in <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1-data">Supplementary file 1</xref>.

An edited version of the letter sent to the authors after peer review is shown, indicating the substantive concerns or comments; minor concerns are not usually shown. Reviewers have the opportunity to discuss the decision before the letter is sent (see <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://elifesciences.org/review-process">review process</ext-link>). Similarly, the author response typically shows only responses to the major concerns raised by the reviewers.</p></boxed-text><p>Thank you for sending your work entitled “Antibacterial Gene Transfer Across the Tree of Life” for consideration at <italic>eLife</italic>. Your article has been favorably evaluated by Diethard Tautz (Senior editor), Wilfred van der Donk (Reviewing editor), and 3 reviewers (Peter Gogarten, Anthony Poole, and David Baltrus). The Reviewing editor and the reviewers discussed their comments before we reached this decision, and the Reviewing editor has assembled the following comments to help you prepare a revised submission.</p><p>The study provides clear evidence for the transfer of the GH25 muramidase between the three domains of life. Phylogenetic analyses establish that the eukaryotic and archaeal versions of the gene have bacterial neighbors and that the transfers occurred more recently than the splitting of the domains. Furthermore, the use of phenotypic tests as well as expression in <italic>E. coli</italic> establishes that the GH25 muramidase is functional across its range and not a pseudogene or other non-functional relic. The assessment of genomic context also supports that the GH25 muramidase gene has been transferred from bacteria to archaeal and eukaryote recipients.</p><p>The potential antibacterial role of the GH25 muramidase gene in the archaeal recipient Aciduliprofundum boonei is addressed by showing that the product of the transferred gene exhibits antibiotic properties against expected species in purified form. Experimental work in a non-model system that lacks standard genetic tools is challenging, so these experiments along with the data in <italic>E. coli</italic> provide a good means of assessing function.</p><p>Finally, the authors test whether the gene can impact competitors. Again, without the capacity to undertake direct knockouts, the authors do an admirable job of testing this, by examining relative growth in both monocultures and cocultures with Mesoaciditoga lauensis, a bacterium known to cohabit the environments from which A. boonei has been isolated.</p><p>All reviewers agreed that this study is of high interest to the readership of <italic>eLife</italic>, but request you address the following points in a revised manuscript:</p><p>1) One question stems from the observation that not all field isolates appear to have lysozyme genes. If there are isolates that genuinely lack the GH25 muramidase genes, these would make a good control.

If there are isolates that genuinely lack the GH25 muramidase genes, these would make a good control. It would be helpful if the authors could comment on whether they think the isolates definitely lack the GH25 muramidase gene, and whether they have tried the growth and coculture assays with any of these isolates</italic>.</p><p>The idea of using an <italic>Aciduliprofundum</italic> strain without GH25 muramidase in coculture experiments is an excellent one. Unfortunately, it is not clear that the strains that lacked GH25 muramidase by PCR truly do not possess the gene. Two species of <italic>Aciduliprofundum</italic> have been fully sequenced, T469 from the Lau Spreading Center in the Western Pacific Ocean and Mar08-339 from the Mid-Atlantic Ridge. The lysozyme sequences from these two strains have only 58% pairwise identity at the nucleotide level, suggesting that there has been substantial divergence between geographically disparate species. Thus, although PCR using degenerate primers designed for both sequenced species was able to detect close relatives in the same vent fields, we suspect that the PCR-negative <italic>Aciduliprofundum</italic> strains likely also have the lysozyme. We have updated the text to reflect this possibility.</p><p><italic>2) The clarity of the manuscript would benefit greatly from the inclusion of a single phylogeny (recA-like genes?) across all domains of life with arrows actually showing putative transfer directions.

We have now performed two more SH tests between the lysozyme HGT tree and either 1) a three-domain constraint tree, or 2) a constraint tree in which the eukaryote branch is monophyletic and other branches are unconstrained. In both cases, the constrained trees were statistically inferior to the HGT trees at P &lt; 0.01. SH tests using monophyletic constraints on individual HGT clades (i.e., plant and bacteria) are not suitable in these individual cases because the transferred genes are monophyletic in both the constraint tree and the HGT tree.</p><p>However, the recurrent patchy distribution of these lysozyme genes and the comparison between branch lengths in lysozyme phylogenies compared to 16S phylogenies further support the hypothesis of HGT, as discussed in the manuscript.</p><p><italic>4) In regards to the competition assays, the reviewers realize that the authors are dealing with intractable genetic systems, but were wondering if there might be cleaner ways of comparing growth between microbes, instead of independent vs. together.

We agree that there may be reasons other than lysozyme-dependent inhibition of bacterial competitors for the results seen in our coculture assays. We have added these caveats to the manuscript in addition to the original ones already stated. While the experiments suggested are interesting, the poor availability of cultured microbes that can subsist in these extreme culture conditions, as well as the need to test such strains for lysozyme susceptibility, make such studies outside the scope of the current work.</p></body></sub-article></article>
