insects to mammals. In males, this culminates in ejaculation, a precisely timed sequence of organ contractions driven by the concerted activity of interneurons, sensory neurons, and motor neurons. Although central command circuits that trigger copulation have been mapped, the motor architecture and the chemical logic that couple specific neuronal subclasses to organ-specific contractility, seminal fluid secretion, and sperm emission remain largely uncharted. This gap in knowledge limits our ability to explain how neural circuits adapt to varying contexts and how their failure contributes to infertility. Here, we present an in-depth anatomical and functional analysis of the motor neurons that innervate the internal male reproductive tract of <italic>Drosophila melanogaster</italic>. We identify two classes of multi-transmitter motor neurons based on neurotransmitter usage, namely octopamine and glutamate neurons (OGNs) and serotonin and glutamate neurons (SGNs), each with a biased pattern of innervation: SGNs predominate in the accessory glands, OGNs in the ejaculatory duct, with equal contributions of each to the seminal vesicles. Both classes co-express vesicular transporters for glutamate (vGlut) and amines (vMAT), confirming their dual chemical identity. Their target organs differentially express receptors for glutamate, octopamine, and serotonin, suggesting combinatorial neuromodulation of contractility. Functional manipulations show that SGNs are essential for male fertility but OGNs are dispensable. Glutamatergic transmission from both classes is also dispensable for fertility. These findings provide the first high-resolution map linking multi-transmitter motor neurons to specific reproductive organs, reveal an unexpected division of labor between serotonergic and octopaminergic signaling pathways, and establish a framework for dissecting conserved neural principles that govern ejaculation and male fertility.</p></abstract><kwd-group kwd-group-type="author-keywords"><kwd>neuron</kwd><kwd>male fertility</kwd><kwd>neurotransmitter receptor</kwd><kwd>ejaculation</kwd></kwd-group><kwd-group kwd-group-type="research-organism"><title>Research organism</title><kwd><italic>D. melanogaster</italic></kwd></kwd-group><funding-group><award-group id="fund1"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="ror">https://ror.org/01cwqze88</institution-id><institution>National Institutes of Health</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>2R01GM115510</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Certel</surname><given-names>Sarah J</given-names></name><name><surname>Stowers</surname><given-names>R Steven</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><funding-statement>The funders had no role in study design, data collection and interpretation, or the decision to submit the work for publication.</funding-statement></funding-group><custom-meta-group><custom-meta specific-use="meta-only"><meta-name>Author impact statement</meta-name><meta-value>Drosophila internal male reproductive organs exhibit parallel innervation by two types of multi-transmitter neurons, a subset of which are essential for fertility, and organ-specific spatially discrete neurotransmitter receptor expression.</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta specific-use="meta-only"><meta-name>publishing-route</meta-name><meta-value>prc</meta-value></custom-meta></custom-meta-group></article-meta></front><body><sec id="s1" sec-type="intro"><title>Introduction</title><p>Reproduction is a biological imperative of all species. For most sexually reproducing animal species, this involves locating a mate, courtship, and most essentially, the transfer of genetic material via copulation. The endpoint of copulation, ejaculation, consists of two coordinated phases, emission and expulsion (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Alwaal et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib110">Soni et al., 2022</xref>). During the emission phase, sperm and seminal fluid are relocated from their site of origin to a central canal for transfer to the female during the subsequent expulsion phase. The series of events that culminate in ejaculation are regulated by a spinal ejaculation generator located in the lumbar L3-L4 region of the spinal cord of mammals that executes a motor program coordinating a series of muscle contractions and relaxations of the internal and external male genitalia (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib120">Truitt and Coolen, 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Carro-Juárez et al., 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Chéhensse et al., 2017</xref>).</p><p>While male external genitalia exhibit remarkable evolutionary variation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib44">Eberhard, 1985</xref>), internal male reproductive organs exhibit remarkable evolutionary conservation over the last 600 million years since the last common ancestor of insects and mammals (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib54">Guerrero et al., 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib51">Gomes et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Beguelini et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib117">Tomas et al., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib46">Fromme et al., 2021</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib85">Oliveira et al., 2021</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib130">Yartsev and Evseeva, 2021</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">da Maciel et al., 2024</xref>). These evolutionarily conserved structures of the male reproductive system include paired testes, seminal vesicles (SVs), and semen-producing organs (prostate glands in humans, accessory glands (AGs) in insects), as well as a singular duct (urethra in humans, ejaculatory duct (ED) in insects) through which sperm and seminal fluid flow during mating.</p><p><italic>Drosophila melanogaster</italic> has been instrumental in revealing fundamental principles of male reproductive behavior and physiology that extend beyond insects, including how neural circuits control mating drive, courtship, and the mechanics and duration of copulation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Acebes et al., 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Billeter et al., 2006a</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib122">Villella and Hall, 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib115">Tayler et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Crickmore and Vosshall, 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib88">Pavlou et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib61">Jois et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Baker et al., 2024</xref>). Among the findings of these studies is the existence of neural circuitry in the ventral nerve cord that regulates ejaculation similar to the spinal ejaculation generator circuitry of mammals, suggesting an ancient evolutionary origin. How the motor neurons directly innervating the internal male reproductive organs control the events leading to ejaculation is less well understood. It is also known in <italic>Drosophila</italic> and other species, including humans, that male ejaculate quality is plastic and can be adapted to environmental conditions, especially the level of male-male competition (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib47">Gage and Baker, 1991</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib123">Wedell and Cook, 1999</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib91">Pizzari et al., 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib93">Pound and Gage, 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Bretman et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib49">Garbaczewska et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib59">Hopkins et al., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">DeLecce et al., 2025</xref>), but the neural mechanisms underlying these adaptations remain to be identified.</p><p>Previous studies have determined there are at least three types of motor neurons innervating the <italic>Drosophila</italic> internal male reproductive system distinguished by neurotransmitter usage, including serotonergic (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib66">Lee and Hall, 2001</xref>), octopaminergic (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib87">Pauls et al., 2018</xref>), and glutamatergic (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib88">Pavlou et al., 2016</xref>) motor neurons, although there may be at least some overlap in neurotransmitter usage as serotonin/glutamate multi-transmitter motor neurons have been reported in the seminal vesicle (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Castellanos et al., 2013</xref>). How these neurons coordinate the motor program to elicit ejaculation is an open question, as is their anatomical organization relative to each other. Clarifying the targets and anatomy of these motor neuron classes will uncover critical principles for how neuronal coordination of internal male reproductive organ function contributes to male fertility. To address these questions, we performed a comprehensive analysis of the neurons innervating each internal organ, defined their neurotransmitter complements and receptor profiles, and tested their necessity for successful sperm transfer and fecundity.</p></sec><sec id="s2" sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><sec id="s2-1"><title><italic>Drosophila</italic> male reproductive system anatomy</title><p>The <italic>Drosophila</italic> male reproductive system consists of paired testes, SVs, and AGs, as well as a singular ED and ejaculatory bulb (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">Demerec, 1950</xref>). The testes are surrounded by smooth muscle with no neuronal innervation, while the SVs, AGs, and ED are ensheathed by neuronally innervated skeletal muscles (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib66">Lee and Hall, 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Billeter et al., 2006b</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib113">Susic-Jung et al., 2012</xref>). The ejaculatory bulb also possesses neuronally innervated skeletal muscle for pumping sperm out of the ED to the female. The SVs fuse just prior to termination in the ED where they form a narrow sphincter that opens during mating to allow sperm to flow. The AGs, insect equivalent of mammalian prostate glands, produce the bulk of seminal fluid (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib126">Wolfner, 1997</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib73">Majane et al., 2022</xref>) and remain separate before terminating in the ED (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Bairati, 1968</xref>).

In the first approach, split-GAL4 drivers specific for each neurotransmitter were tested in pairwise combinations. Both <italic>Tdc2-AD</italic> paired with <italic>vGlut-GAL4-DBD</italic> (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2D</xref>) and <italic>vGlut-AD</italic> paired with <italic>Tdc2-GAL4-DBD</italic> (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2E</xref>) exhibited expression patterns very similar to <italic>Tdc2-GAL4</italic> with dense innervation of the SV and ED, and sparse innervation of the AGs. These results suggest that all the Tdc2 neurons innervating the male reproductive system are OA/glutamate dual neurotransmitter neurons (OGNs). Similarly, both <italic>TRH-AD</italic> paired with <italic>vGlut-GAL4-DBD</italic> (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2F</xref>) and <italic>vGlut-AD</italic> paired with <italic>TRH-GAL4-DBD</italic> (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2G</xref>) exhibited expression patterns very similar to <italic>TRH-GAL4</italic> with dense innervation of the SVs and AGs with modest innervation of the ED. These results suggest that all the serotonergic neurons innervating the male reproductive system are 5-HT/glutamate dual neurotransmitter neurons (SGNs). To determine if there is overlap between the OGNs and SGNs, <italic>Tdc2-AD</italic> was paired with <italic>TRH-GAL4-DBD</italic> with the result that no neuronal expression was observed (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2H</xref>). This result suggests the OGNs and SGNs are exclusive and non-overlapping.</p><p>A second approach to assess overlap between octopaminergic, serotonergic, and glutamatergic neurons of the male reproductive system utilized pairwise combinations of GAL4 and LexA drivers specific for each neurotransmitter. Pairing <italic>TRH-GAL4</italic> and <italic>Tdc2-LexA</italic> together with <italic>UAS-6XGFP</italic> and <italic>LexAop-6XmCherry</italic> reporters revealed no overlap in either the SVs (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3A-F</xref>), ED (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3G-L</xref>), or AGs (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3M-R</xref>). These results are consistent with the split-GAL4 result above of no intersection between octopaminergic and serotonergic neurons of the male reproductive system, although both neuron types are often tightly fasciculated, especially in the SVs. Pairing <italic>vGlut-LexA</italic> with <italic>TRH-GAL4</italic> revealed a high degree of overlap in the SVs (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s1">Figure 3—figure supplement 1A–F</xref>), partial overlap in the ED (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s1">Figure 3—figure supplement 1G–L</xref>), and near complete overlap in the AGs (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s1">Figure 3—figure supplement 1M-R</xref>). Pairing <italic>vGlut-LexA</italic> with <italic>Tdc2-GAL4</italic> revealed significant overlap in the SVs (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s2">Figure 3—figure supplement 2A-F</xref>), majority overlap in the ED (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s2">Figure 3—figure supplement 2G-L</xref>), and limited overlap in the AGs (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s2">Figure 3—figure supplement 2M-R</xref>). The results of the split-GAL4 intersectional strategy and the GAL4/LexA overlap strategy are entirely consistent with each other. Taken together, they demonstrate that the <italic>Drosophila</italic> internal male reproductive system receives input from two distinct and non-overlapping motor-neuron populations, one population that co-expresses octopamine and glutamate (OGNs) and another distinct population that co-expresses serotonin and glutamate (SGNs).

To overcome this limitation, expansion microscopy was performed on EDs using co-conditional expression of vGlut-40XMYC and 6XV5-vMAT separately in SGNs and OGNs as above. The protocol utilized in these experiments reported 10X expansion in a single round (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Damstra et al., 2023</xref>), and this agreed well with our empirically determined expansion factor of 10.47X based on the size comparison of nuclei area in muscles of the unexpanded and expanded EDs (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5s5">Figure 5—figure supplement 5A and B</xref>, respectively).

This distribution pattern is not entirely surprising as it is consistent with the prior observation that vesicular neurotransmitter transporters have been detected on LDCVs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib131">Yu et al., 2025</xref>).</p><p>Similar results were observed in the ED and AGs. In the ED, prominent IA2-GFP expression was evident (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6s4">Figure 6—figure supplement 4C and I</xref>) that partially co-localized with vGlut-40XMYC (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6s4">Figure 6—figure supplement 4E and K</xref>) and 6XV5-vMAT (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6s4">Figure 6—figure supplement 4F and L</xref>).

This finding of pronounced expression of IA2-GFP throughout the pre-synaptic terminals of neurons innervating the male reproductive system suggests substantial LDCVs are present in both SGNs and OGNs, and that these neurons are thus communicating not just via small molecule neurotransmitters inside synaptic vesicles but also by neuropeptides contained within LDCVs.</p></sec><sec id="s2-10"><title>No cholinergic or GABAergic transmission at OGN or SGN synapses</title><p>Although to our knowledge, there have been no motor neurons reported in <italic>Drosophila</italic> that use acetylcholine or GABA as a neurotransmitter, to rule out these possibilities for the male reproductive system, <italic>Drosophila</italic> containing genome-edited 7XMYC-vAChT and 9XV5-vGAT were immunostained for their corresponding epitope tags.

As a first step in testing this prediction, GAL4 drivers for each of these neurotransmitters were paired with the <italic>UAS-CD8-mCherry</italic> reporter and assessed for expression. As it is well established that the GluRIIA-E/kainate type glutamate receptors mediate synaptic transmission at <italic>Drosophila</italic> NMJs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">DiAntonio, 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib56">He and Dickman, 2025</xref>), GAL4 drivers for all five were assessed. GAL4 drivers for GluRIIA, GluRIID, and GluRIIE showed no expression in the male reproductive system, but they also exhibited no expression in other adult or larval muscles where they are known to be expressed. These results suggest that the GAL4 drivers for these three GluRII receptors are simply non-functional and are, therefore, non-informative. However, GluRIIB-GAL4 and GluRIIC-GAL4 exhibited broad expression in the musculature of the male reproductive system (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7A and B</xref>, respectively).

In the SV, GluRIIA-GFP (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8">Figure 8B and E</xref>) exhibited punctate expression that paralleled, but was complementary to, that of the glutamatergic synaptic vesicle marker vGlut-40XV5 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8">Figure 8A and D</xref>). This distribution of GluRIIA-GFP is not unlike its distribution at the NMJ of third instar larva, optimally localized post-synaptically to bind glutamate released from pre-synaptic terminals (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Beckers et al., 2024</xref>).

OAMB-10XV5 was similarly distributed in the ED with low-level expression in muscle and clearly discernible expression in pre-synaptic neurons (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8s1">Figure 8—figure supplement 1J</xref>) based on substantial overlap with Syn (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8s1">Figure 8—figure supplement 1L</xref>).</p><p>Strong OAMB-10XV5 expression was also observed in the epithelial cells of the ED in a honeycomb pattern (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8s1">Figure 8—figure supplement 1M and P</xref>) reminiscent of Dlg and presumably associated with the plasma membrane. OAMB-10XV5 expression in the epithelial cells of the AGs was similar to its expression in the epithelial cells of the ED with prominent signal in a honeycomb pattern (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8s2">Figure 8—figure supplement 2A and D</xref>). OAMB-10XV5 also exhibited low-level expression in the muscles of the AG and expression in the pre-synaptic neurons (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8s2">Figure 8—figure supplement 2G</xref>) by virtue of significant overlap with Syn (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8s2">Figure 8—figure supplement 2I</xref>). Prominent OAMB-10XV5 expression was also observed in the ejaculatory bulb. Low-level expression of OAMB-10XV5 was detected in the muscles of the ejaculatory bulb, as was expression in the pre-synaptic neurons (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8s2">Figure 8—figure supplement 2J and M</xref>) as evidenced by mostly overlapping expression with Syn (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8s2">Figure 8—figure supplement 2L and O</xref>). In the non-muscular portion of the ejaculatory bulb, OAMB-10XV5 expression was readily discernible in the epithelial cells in a honeycomb pattern (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8s2">Figure 8—figure supplement 2J and P</xref>).</p><p>OAα2R-20XV5 exhibited strong expression in the muscles of both the SVs and more distal regions of the proximal ED near where it connects with the ejaculatory bulb, as well as lower-level expression in the AGs (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8s3">Figure 8—figure supplement 3A</xref>). Higher resolution images of OAα2R-20XV5 in the SV indicate expression is restricted to the muscle (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8s3">Figure 8—figure supplement 3G</xref>) as there is no apparent overlap with Syn (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8s3">Figure 8—figure supplement 3I</xref>). A cross-section of the SV muscle reveals OAα2R-20XV5 is localized to the membrane of the muscle (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8s3">Figure 8—figure supplement 3J</xref>), as would be expected for a GPCR. In the AGs, OAα2R-20XV5 is expressed in the muscles (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8s3">Figure 8—figure supplement 3M and P</xref>) as well as in the pre-synaptic neurons, as evidenced by co-localization with Syn (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8s3">Figure 8—figure supplement 3O and R</xref>). OAα2R-20XV5 expression ends abruptly just after the SVs fuse into the sphincter that regulates the movement of sperm into the ED (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8s4">Figure 8—figure supplement 4A and D</xref>). OAα2R is expressed in the pre-synaptic neurons innervating the sphincter with little to no expression in the sphincter muscles (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8s4">Figure 8—figure supplement 4C and F</xref>). In the proximal region of the anterior ED, prominent OAα2R-20XV5 expression is observed throughout the innervating neurons with little to no OAα2R-20XV5 in the muscles (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8s4">Figure 8—figure supplement 4G, I, J, and L</xref>). In contrast, in the distal region of the anterior ED, robust expression of OAα2R-20XV5 is detected in the muscles (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8s4">Figure 8—figure supplement 4M, P, and S</xref>) but not in the pre-synaptic neurons (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8s4">Figure 8—figure supplement 4O, R, and U</xref>). This complementary pattern of OAα2R-20XV5 in neurons but not muscles in the proximal ED and muscles but not neurons in the distal ED suggests these different regions of the ED are exhibiting a differential response to OA. As in the SV, OAα2R-20XV5 localizes to the membrane of the muscles as evident in a cross-sectional image (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8s4">Figure 8—figure supplement 4S</xref>). Interestingly, in this region, Syn expression is inside the muscles of the ED (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8s4">Figure 8—figure supplement 4T</xref>), potentially suggesting the muscles are being stimulated from the inside, or alternatively, that the neurons are stimulating the underlying epithelial cells. As pre-synaptic neuronal expression of adrenoreceptors in mammals has been shown to be release-inhibiting (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Brown and Gillespie, 1957</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib111">Starke, 1972</xref>), including in the urinary bladder (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib109">Somogyi and de Groat, 1990</xref>) and vas deferens (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib84">O’Connor et al., 1999</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib99">Scheibner et al., 2001</xref>), OAα2R expression in the pre-synaptic neurons of the internal male reproductive system may also function via inhibitory auto-reception.</p><p>OAβ2R-40XV5 exhibits strong expression in the epithelial cells of the ED, the muscles of the ejaculatory bulb, the muscles of the SVs near the point of fusion, the testes, with lower-level muscle expression in the SVs, ED, and AGs (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8s5">Figure 8—figure supplement 5A</xref>). Higher resolution images of the SV reveal obvious expression in the muscle (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8s5">Figure 8—figure supplement 5D and G</xref>) but not in the pre-synaptic neurons as there is no apparent overlap with Syn (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8s5">Figure 8—figure supplement 5F and I</xref>). A cross-sectional image of the SV reveals OAβ2R-40XV5 is localized to the plasma membrane of muscle cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8s5">Figure 8—figure supplement 5J</xref>). In higher resolution images of the ED, moderate levels of OAβ2R-40XV5 are present in the muscles (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8s5">Figure 8—figure supplement 5M and P</xref>) but not in the innervating pre-synaptic neurons as there is no obvious overlap with Syn (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8s5">Figure 8—figure supplement 5O and R</xref>). At the junction where the SVs fuse into a single duct, OAβ2R-40XV5 expression is strong prior to fusion but drops off abruptly at the point of full fusion (arrow, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8s6">Figure 8—figure supplement 6A</xref>). The strongest levels of OAβ2R-40XV5 expression throughout the entire male reproductive system is in what appears to be the epithelial cells that line the ED (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8s6">Figure 8—figure supplement 6A</xref>). A cross-section of the ED reveals the distribution of OAβ2R-40XV5 in epithelial cells is exclusively at the apical surface (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8s6">Figure 8—figure supplement 6D</xref>). Also notable, there is another boundary of OAβ2R-40XV5 expression in the SVs somewhat prior to fusion (solid arrow, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8s6">Figure 8—figure supplement 6G</xref>). Higher resolution images of OAβ2R-40XV5 expression at the point of SV fusion show the sharp dip in expression at the point of full fusion (arrow, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8s6">Figure 8—figure supplement 6J</xref>). A cross-sectional image also reveals the drop in expression and membrane localization of OAβ2R-40XV5 in the muscle (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8s6">Figure 8—figure supplement 6M</xref>). Similar to the proximal anterior ED, the more distal region of the anterior ED exhibits strong expression in the muscles, and especially the underlying epithelial cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8s7">Figure 8—figure supplement 7A and D</xref>). In the AGs, OAβ2R-40XV5 expression is manifest in the muscles (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8s7">Figure 8—figure supplement 7G and J</xref>) but does not overlap with the pre-synaptic neurons as evidenced by the lack of overlap with Syn (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8s7">Figure 8—figure supplement 7I and L</xref>). Prominent OAβ2R-40XV5 expression was also observed in the ejaculatory bulb (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8s7">Figure 8—figure supplement 7M and P</xref>). As β2 adrenoreceptors relax bladder muscles in mice (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib128">Wuest et al., 2009</xref>), OAβ2R may relax muscles in the male reproductive system.</p><p>Octopamine receptor expression in the internal organs of the male reproductive tract was predicted based on the dense OGN innervation of these tissues. Although OA receptor presence in these muscles aligns with their role in modulating contractile strength and rhythm, the organ-specific differences in receptor subtype abundance could only be established empirically. Epithelial expression implies that octopamine influences non-neuronal functions such as protein secretion or barrier permeability, but the precise cellular responses remain to be defined. Mapping OAMB, OAα2R, and OAβ2R to discrete muscle, neuronal, and epithelial compartments provides mechanistic information about how octopamine fine-tunes contraction, secretion, and presynaptic feedback across the male reproductive tract, offering an evolutionary framework for adrenergic control of fertility and pinpointing cell-specific targets for modulating reproductive output.</p></sec><sec id="s2-14"><title>5-HT7 is widely expressed in the male reproductive system but most prominently in the sphincter region</title><p>Since the <italic>5-HT7-GAL4</italic> reporter delineates a sharp posterior boundary in the SV, endogenous 5-HT7 receptor expression was evaluated to pinpoint where 5-HT may directly modulate reproductive tract motility. To assess the expression pattern of the 5-HT7 receptor, a 20XV5 tag was added to the carboxy-terminus by CRISPR/Cas9 genome editing at its endogenous genomic location. 5-HT7-20XV5 localizes to the muscles of the SV just before and after the junction, the epithelial cells of the AGs, and the ejaculatory bulb (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8s8">Figure 8—figure supplement 8A</xref>). Higher resolution images of the SV reveal low-level expression in muscles (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8s8">Figure 8—figure supplement 8D and G</xref>), as well as expression in the pre-synaptic neurons innervating the male reproductive system as evidenced by co-localization with Syn (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8s8">Figure 8—figure supplement 8F and I</xref>). In the ED, 5-HT7-20XV5 is expressed in the muscles (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8s8">Figure 8—figure supplement 8J and M</xref>), but unlike the SV, it is not expressed in the pre-synaptic neurons as it does not appear to co-localize with Syn (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8s8">Figure 8—figure supplement 8L and O</xref>). Expression levels of 5-HT7-20XV5 increase in the SV near the point of fusion and are maximal from just before the junction all the way to the terminus in the ED (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8s9">Figure 8—figure supplement 9A</xref>). Expression levels of 5-HT7-20XV5 appear to increase at a discrete boundary point on the SVs prior to fusion (arrow, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8s9">Figure 8—figure supplement 9D</xref>). This boundary of increasing expression at this same region of the SV is highly reminiscent of OAβ2R-40XV5 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8s6">Figure 8—figure supplement 6G</xref>). A higher resolution image of the sphincter region of the SV post-fusion reveals high levels of 5-HT7-20XV5 expression (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8s9">Figure 8—figure supplement 9G</xref>) but not in the innervating pre-synaptic neurons based on the absence of co-localization with Syn (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8s9">Figure 8—figure supplement 9I</xref>). A cross-section of this same region reveals the 5-HT7-20XV5 protein localizes to muscle membranes (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8s9">Figure 8—figure supplement 9J</xref>). A high-resolution image of the terminus of the sphincter confirms 5-HT7-20XV5 expression extends all the way to the end (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8s9">Figure 8—figure supplement 9M</xref>). This observation of 5-HT7-20XV5 expression throughout the fused sphincter region of the SV contrasts with that of OAα2R-20XV5 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8s4">Figure 8—figure supplement 4D</xref>) and OAβ2R-40XV5 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8s6">Figure 8—figure supplement 6A</xref>), both of which end at the point of full SV fusion and suggests 5-HT plays a more important role than OA in sphincter regulation. 5-HT7-20XV5 expression is also elevated in the muscles at the terminus of the AGs (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8s9">Figure 8—figure supplement 9P</xref>). In the AGs, 5-HT7-20XV5 is most prominently expressed in the underlying epithelial cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8s10">Figure 8—figure supplement 10A and D</xref>). An AG cross-section reveals 5-HT7-20XV5 localizes exclusively to the apical surface of the epithelial cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8s10">Figure 8—figure supplement 10G</xref>), highly reminiscent of OAβ2R-40XV5 localization to the apical surface of epithelial cells of the ED (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8s6">Figure 8—figure supplement 6D</xref>). Nearer the surface of the AGs, low-level expression of 5-HT7-20XV5 is detected in the muscle (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8s10">Figure 8—figure supplement 10J</xref>) and obvious expression is observed in the innervating pre-synaptic neurons based on overlapping expression with Syn (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8s10">Figure 8—figure supplement 10L</xref>). 5-HT7-20XV5 expression was also observed in the ejaculatory bulb (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig8s10">Figure 8—figure supplement 10M</xref>). Interestingly, none of the OA or serotonin receptors exhibited preferential accumulation in the post-synaptic muscle opposite the pre-synaptic terminals, as observed for GluRIIA. This observation implies volume transmission may play a significant role in modulating muscle activity in the male reproductive system. Neurotransmitter signaling via volume transmission has previously been proposed for the <italic>Drosophila</italic> female reproductive system based on expression patterns of OA receptors (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib97">Rohrbach et al., 2024a</xref>).</p></sec><sec id="s2-15"><title>SGNs are essential for male fertility but OGNs are dispensable</title><p>Having established that both OGNs and SGNs innervate the male reproductive system, an obvious question follows: what are their roles in male fertility?

However, in Tβh and Tdc2 mutant flies that fail to synthesize OA, glutamate signaling in the OGNs innervating the male reproductive system is still intact. To determine if simultaneously silencing the OGNs innervating the male reproductive system for both glutamate and OA signaling causes sterility, <italic>Tdc2-GAL4-DBD</italic> was combined with <italic>AbdB-AD</italic> and <italic>UAS-BONT-C</italic> to block all synaptic transmission in these neurons (BONT-C cleaves the SNARE protein syntaxin <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib55">Han et al., 2022</xref>). This intersectional combination results in the silencing of only the Tdc2 neurons in the posterior VNC by virtue of the restricted expression of the AbdB-AD hemidriver to the posterior few segments of the VNC. The result was the same as eliminating OA signaling alone, males were fertile, and females were sterile (<xref ref-type="table" rid="table1">Table 1</xref>), thus establishing that neither OA nor glutamate signaling is required for fertility in the OGNs innervating the male reproductive system.

The observation that females were also sterile, while no serotonergic innervation of the female reproductive system has been reported, suggests that male sterility is due to 5-HT neurons common to both males and females, and thus the male sterility cannot be unambiguously attributed to the SGNs innervating the male reproductive system.</p><p>In an attempt to identify a split-GAL4 combination that more specifically targets SGNs innervating the male reproductive system, several dozen hemi-drivers that express in neurons whose cell bodies are located in the most posterior region of the VNC were screened for male sterility in combination with UAS-BONT-C and either <italic>TRH-AD</italic> or <italic>TRH-GAL4-DBD</italic>, as appropriate.

During copulation, <italic>Drosophila</italic> males deliver seminal fluid and ~4000–6000 sperm to females during a tightly choreographed ~20 min window (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib62">Kaufman and Demerec, 1942</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib50">Gilbert, 1981</xref>). This involves the emission of sperm and seminal fluid from their sites of origin into the ED where they mix and are subsequently expelled into the female reproductive tract. Despite the critical importance of ejaculation, its neuronal mechanisms have remained poorly defined, hindering broader insights into the neural logic of male fertility. Here, we close this gap by demonstrating that two distinct yet intermingled classes of amine/glutamate neurons, OGNs and SGNs, coordinate the ejaculatory sequence that ensures successful reproduction. Their transmitter pairs confer the capacity to co-release both fast excitatory and slower-acting aminergic modulatory neurotransmitters. Differential expression of ionotropic glutamate receptors and aminergic metabotropic neurotransmitter receptors combines in post-synaptic muscle across the male reproductive system to confer an additional level of complexity to coordinately regulate fluid secretion, organ contractility, and directional sperm movement, to the end of optimizing male fertility.</p><p>This system can serve as a genetically tractable model to gain general insights into how multi-transmitter neurons coordinate and modulate interrelated action sequences critical for complex organ function.

Thus, pre-synaptic expression of OAMB and OAα2R may have the effect of increasing the cycling frequency of muscle contractions and relaxations.</p><p>As glutamate is acting via post-synaptic GluRII-type receptors, its effect will almost certainly be excitatory with the result of eliciting fast muscle contractions. In contrast, the functional consequences of OA and 5-HT are not so clear-cut. Either of these amines could enhance muscle contractions or facilitate muscle relaxation, depending on the neurotransmitter receptor(s) receiving the signal. In muscles of the mammalian prostate and lower urinary tract, α-type adrenergic and noradrenergic receptors have been demonstrated to augment muscle contractions while β-type receptors have been found to facilitate muscle relaxation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib58">Honda et al., 1985</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib79">Michel and Vrydag, 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib128">Wuest et al., 2009</xref>).

The amines OA or 5-HT acting on post-synaptic metabotropic OA and 5-HT receptors will have the effect of either prolonging the length of, or augmenting the relaxation of, muscles, dependent on the specific aminergic neurotransmitter receptors involved. These latter effects will be delayed relative to the glutamate-induced fast muscle contractions due to the discrepancy in the time course of action between ionotropic and metabotropic receptors. Thus, co-releasing a fast-acting excitatory neurotransmitter acting through an ionotropic receptor simultaneous with a modulatory aminergic neurotransmitter acting through slower-acting GPCRs in the same multi-transmitter neuron may create a sequential timing mechanism whereby fast glutamate-mediated muscle contractions always precede either amine-mediated prolonging of muscle contraction or facilitation of muscle relaxation. A single neuron co-releasing one fast and one slow neurotransmitter may thus have the advantage over two distinct neurons separately releasing these transmitters in that the former can more effectively synchronize, and at the same time, stagger events that require precise timing.</p></sec><sec id="s3-3"><title>Potential for adaptation to environment</title><p>The complexity of neuronal control of male reproductive function revealed in this investigation exposes a variety of possibilities for adaptive regulation to dynamic environmental conditions. Polygynous <italic>Drosophila</italic> males are well-established to alter the quantity and quality of their ejaculate based on environmental circumstances, especially the level of competition with other males (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Bretman et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib81">Moatt et al., 2014</xref>), but also due to nutrient availability (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib71">Macartney et al., 2021</xref>) and the presence of pathogens (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib69">Liao et al., 2024</xref>). The male reproductive system may adapt to environmental conditions by tuning octopamine, serotonin, and glutamate signaling, adjusting the levels of their biosynthetic enzymes, the vesicular glutamate and monoamine transporters vGlut and vMAT, or relevant receptors to alter the amount of sperm and seminal fluid released during copulation. Given that glutamate-deficient SGNs and OGNs, as well as BONT-C-silenced OGNs, show no readily detectable male fertility defects under benign laboratory conditions, the primary role of glutamate and octopamine may be to optimize male reproductive success under fluctuating or adverse environmental conditions.</p><p>An additional potential mechanism for altering OA and/or 5-HT levels is extra-synaptic volume transmission, whereby the level of OA or 5-HT secreted into the hemolymph in locations anatomically distant from the male reproductive system. Thus, global levels of OA and 5-HT in the hemolymph could be adjusted based on environmental conditions and this signal could then impact the male reproductive system to optimize ejaculate quality and quantity. Finally, the presence of OAMB and 5-HT7 on epithelial cells suggests the potential for the regulation of the quality of seminal fluid, as the expression of these receptors implies, they could differentially alter gene expression in the epithelial cells in response to changing levels of OA and 5-HT. The results of this study create a foundation for mechanistic investigations into the molecular basis by which male reproductive resources are adaptively modulated.</p></sec><sec id="s3-4"><title>Potential for signaling via neuropeptides</title><p>The broad abundant expression of the LDCV reporter IA2 in the neurons innervating the internal organs of the male reproductive system suggests a significant role for neuropeptide signaling since neuropeptides are known to be packaged into LDCVs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib89">Pelletier and Leclerc, 1979</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib64">Kreiner et al., 1986</xref>). Bolstering the prospect of this possibility, numerous neuropeptides across evolutionary distant insect species have been shown to alter the frequency and/or amplitude of the spontaneous peristaltic waves in the ED of male insect reproductive systems (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib75">Marciniak et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Čižmár et al., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib65">Lange et al., 2023</xref>).

The differential expression patterns of OAα2R, OAβ2R, and 5-HT7 in this region of the SV is intriguing. The extent of OAα2R and OAβ2R expression ends very shortly after the merge, at precisely the point where full SV fusion occurs and there is no longer a partition separating the ducts (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Bairati, 1968</xref>). Only 5-HT7 expression extends into the fully fused SV that constitutes the sphincter separating the SV from the ED. This expression pattern implies a prominent role for 5-HT7 in sphincter regulation. Previous reports of 5-HT7 mediating relaxation of smooth muscle in the mammalian gut (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Carter et al., 1995</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib94">Prins et al., 1999</xref>), urinary bladder neck (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib96">Recio et al., 2009</xref>), cardiovascular system (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib68">Leung et al., 1996</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Chang Chien et al., 2015</xref>), lymphatic system (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Chan and von Der Weid, 2003</xref>), and oviduct (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib60">Inoue et al., 2003</xref>) raise the possibility it may function to relax the sphincter muscles during copulation to permit sperm flow, consistent with our observations that silencing a subset of serotonergic neurons results in male fertility due to failure of sperm emission into the ED (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig10s1">Figure 10—figure supplement 1</xref>). Additionally, the expression of OAβ2R and the likely relaxation-promoting 5-HT7 receptors increases sharply in the SV just prior to the point of fusion. Perhaps not coincidentally, this limit of expression corresponds with the distal-most extent of sperm localization in the SV where relaxation of the SV muscles must also occur for sperm to move along the duct to the ED. It is also notable, as revealed in the Ca++ imaging experiments, that the sphincter region is the site of initiation of the peristaltic waves of muscle contractions that are promulgated through the ED. The SV/ED junction is thus a critical control center for both regulation of sperm flow into the ED during mating and initiating neuron-independent peristaltic waves in the ED.</p></sec><sec id="s3-6"><title>Molecular continuity of neurotransmitter signaling between males and females</title><p>The expression of 5-HT7 and OAβ2R on the apical surface of the epithelial cells lining the AG and ED, respectively, is surprising because it implies that levels of 5-HT and OA are fluctuating in the lumen of these organs. The origin of these neurotransmitters is not obvious but if OA and 5-HT are present in the lumen of the AG and ED, another intriguing possibility is that these neurotransmitters are transferred to the female at mating for signaling in order to modulate female behavior and/or reproductive activity. A recent study detailed the molecular continuity of proteins in the seminal fluid of males functionally interacting with proteins in the female reproductive tract (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib77">McCullough et al., 2022</xref>). The potential presence of OA and 5-HT in the lumen of the AG and ED raises the possibility that this molecular continuity could extend to neurotransmitters in male seminal fluid signaling to neurotransmitter receptors in the female reproductive tract to convey information such as health, internal state, or environmental conditions to regulate female reproductive output. A detailed examination of the expression patterns of OA receptors in the female reproductive tract indicates this is indeed a possibility, at least for OA signaling (<xref ref-type="bibr"

Briefly, <italic>Drosophila</italic> male reproductive systems were dissected and fixed for at least 30 min in 4% paraformaldehyde. The EDs were then dissected out and immunostained as described above except using ATTO 647N secondary antibodies. Tissues were then incubated in Acryloyl-X solution, 1:100 dilution (Invitrogen, catalog #2604348), overnight, at room temperature and protected from light. The next day, the EDs were rinsed in PBS and incubated in TRex solution at 4° C, for 45–60 min. 0.15% ammonium persulfate and 0.15% TEMED was added and the TREx mixture was quickly transferred to chamber slides. TREx mixture with EDs were placed in wells (1 ED per well), cover slipped and allowed to polymerize at 37 C for at least 45 min. After gel polymerization, each gel-ED was trimmed to eliminate excess gel. Gel-EDs were incubated in proteinase K (New England Biolabs, catalog #P8107S, 800 U/ml) 1:100 solution, overnight at room temperature. Expansion of gel-EDs was done the following day. Three washes in water were performed, at least 20 min per wash. DAPI (Thermofisher Scientific, catalog# D1306), 2 ug/ml, was added in the first wash to aid in tissue visualization. After the third wash, hydrogel-EDs were trimmed again and placed in chamber slides. 1 hydrogel-ED per well and cover slipped. Imaged expanded EDs in upright confocal (Leica Stellaris 8 DIVE) equipped with a 40x NA = 0.8 water objective. z Stack images were deconvoluted using the Lightning confocal function and 3D images were generated for each image. EDs typically expanded approximately tenfold.</p></sec><sec id="s4-11"><title>Colocalization analysis</title><p>Digitally deconvolved 3D images of expanded EDs were analyzed using ImageJ software (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib100">Schindelin et al., 2012</xref>). To exclude background in an unbiased manner, we thresholded all images by using the Otsu threshold and calculated Manders’ coefficients by using the BIOP JACop.plugin. A scatter plot of green and red pixel intensities (associated with each of the two markers, Vmat and Vglut) was generated by using the colocalization function. Manders' coefficient ranges from 0 to 1, indicating no or complete colocalization. Prior to doing the colocalization analysis of each image, a region of interest (ROI) was traced using the stain from the CD8 marker. This ROI corresponded to an axon terminal.</p></sec><sec id="s4-12"><title>Mating assays</title><p>Mating assays involved placing single 3–7-day-old virgin males with single 3–7- day-old virgin females in the same well of a 12-well tissue culture plate without anesthesia.

They identify two classes of multi-transmitter motor neurons-OGNs (octopamine/glutamate) and SGNs (serotonin/glutamate)-with distinct innervation patterns across reproductive organs. The authors further characterize the differential expression of glutamate, octopamine, and serotonin receptors in both epithelial and muscular tissues of these organs. Behavioral assays reveal that SGNs are essential for male fertility, whereas OGNs and glutamatergic transmission are dispensable. This work provides a high-resolution map linking neuromodulatory identity to organ-specific motor control, offering a valuable framework to explore the neural basis of male reproductive function.</p><p>Strengths:</p><p>Through the use of an extensive set of GAL4 drivers and antibodies, this work successfully and precisely defines the neurons that innervate the male reproductive tract, identifying the specific organs they target and the nature of the neurotransmitters they release. It also characterizes the expression patterns and localization of the corresponding neurotransmitter receptors across different tissues. The authors describe two distinct groups of dual-identity neurons innervating the male reproductive tract: OGNs, which co-express octopamine and glutamate, and SGNs, which co-express serotonin and glutamate. They further demonstrate that the various organs within the male reproductive system differentially express receptors for these neurotransmitters. Based on these findings, the authors propose that a single neuron capable of co-releasing a fast-acting neurotransmitter along side a slower-acting one may more effectively synchronize and stagger events that require precise timing. This, together with the differential expression of ionotropic glutamate receptors and metabotropic aminergic receptors in postsynaptic muscle tissue, adds an additional layer of complexity to the coordinated regulation of fluid secretion, organ contractility, and directional sperm movement-all contributing to the optimization of male fertility.</p><p>Weaknesses:</p><p>One potential limitation of the study is the absence of information regarding the number of individuals examined for the various characterizations, which may weaken the strength of the conclusions. Another limitation may be the lack of quantitative analyses in the colocalization and morphological differentiation experiments. Nevertheless, the authors have indicated that such quantifications will be provided in a forthcoming publication; therefore, this should be considered only a partial limitation, as it is expected to be addressed in the near future.</p><p>Wider context:</p><p>This study delivers the first detailed anatomical map connecting multi-transmitter motor neurons with specific male reproductive structures. It highlights a previously unrecognized functional specialization between serotonergic and octopaminergic pathways and lays the groundwork for exploring fundamental neural mechanisms that regulate ejaculation and fertility in males. The principles uncovered here may help explain how males of Drosophila and other organisms adjust reproductive behaviors in response to environmental changes. Furthermore, by shedding light on how multi-transmitter systems operate in reproductive control, this model could provide insights into therapeutic targets for conditions such as male infertility and prostate cancer-where similar neuronal populations are involved in humans. Ultimately, this genetically accessible system serves as a powerful tool for uncovering how multi-transmitter neurons orchestrate coordinated physiological actions necessary for the functioning of complex organs.</p></body></sub-article><sub-article article-type="referee-report" id="sa3"><front-stub><article-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.108225.3.sa3</article-id><title-group><article-title>Reviewer #3 (Public review):</article-title></title-group><contrib-group><contrib contrib-type="author"><anonymous/><role specific-use="referee">Reviewer</role></contrib></contrib-group></front-stub><body><p>Summary:</p><p>This work provides an overview of the motor neuron landscape in the male reproductive system. Some work had been done to elucidate the circuits of ejaculation in the spine, as well as, the cord but this work fills a gap of knowledge at the level of the reproductive organs. Using complementary approaches the authors show that there are two types of motor neurons that are mutually exclusive: neurons that co-express octopamine and glutamate and neurons that co-express serotonin and glutamate. They also show evidence that both types of neurons express large dense core vesicles indicating that neuropeptides play a role in male fertility. This paper provides a thorough characterization of expression of the different glutamate, octopamine and serotonin receptors in the different organs and tissues of the male reproductive system. The differential expression in different tissues and organs allows building initial theories on the control of emission and expulsion. Additionally, the authors characterize the expression of synaptic proteins and the neuromuscular junction sites. On a mechanistic level, the authors show that neither octopamine/glutamate neuron transmission nor glutamate transmission in serotonin/glutamate neurons are required for male fertility. This final result is quite surprising and opens up many questions on how ejaculation is coordinated.</p><p>Strengths:</p><p>This work fills an important gap on characterization of innervation of the male reproductive system by providing an extensive characterization of the motor neurons and the potential receptors of motor neuron release.The authors show convincing evidence of glutamate/monoamine co-release and of mutual exclusivity of serotonin/glutamate and octopamine/glutamate neurons.</p><p>Weaknesses:</p><p>The experiment looking at peristaltic waves in the male organs is missing labeling of the different regions and quantification of the observed waves.</p></body></sub-article><sub-article article-type="author-comment" id="sa4"><front-stub><article-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.108225.3.sa4</article-id><title-group><article-title>Author response</article-title></title-group><contrib-group><contrib contrib-type="author"><name><surname>Chaverra</surname><given-names>Marta</given-names></name><role specific-use="author">Author</role><aff><institution>Montana State University</institution><addr-line><named-content content-type="city">Bozeman</named-content></addr-line><country>United States</country></aff></contrib><contrib contrib-type="author"><name><surname>Toney</surname><given-names>John Paul</given-names></name><role specific-use="author">Author</role><aff><institution>Montana State University</institution><addr-line><named-content content-type="city">Bozeman</named-content></addr-line><country>United States</country></aff></contrib><contrib contrib-type="author"><name><surname>Dardenne-Ankringa</surname><given-names>Lizetta D</given-names></name><role specific-use="author">Author</role><aff><institution>Montana State University</institution><addr-line><named-content content-type="city">Bozeman</named-content></addr-line><country>United States</country></aff></contrib><contrib contrib-type="author"><name><surname>Knee</surname><given-names>Jace Tolleson</given-names></name><role specific-use="author">Author</role><aff><institution>Montana State University</institution><addr-line><named-content content-type="city">Bozeman</named-content></addr-line><country>United States</country></aff></contrib><contrib contrib-type="author"><name><surname>Morris</surname><given-names>Ann R</given-names></name><role specific-use="author">Author</role><aff><institution>Montana State University</institution><addr-line><named-content content-type="city">Bozeman</named-content></addr-line><country>United States</country></aff></contrib><contrib contrib-type="author"><name><surname>Wadhams</surname><given-names>Joseph B</given-names></name><role specific-use="author">Author</role><aff><institution>Montana State University</institution><addr-line><named-content content-type="city">Bozeman</named-content></addr-line><country>United States</country></aff></contrib><contrib contrib-type="author"><name><surname>Certel</surname><given-names>Sarah J</given-names></name><role specific-use="author">Author</role><aff><institution>The University of Montana</institution><addr-line><named-content content-type="city">Missoula</named-content></addr-line><country>United States</country></aff></contrib><contrib contrib-type="author"><name><surname>Stowers</surname><given-names>R Steven</given-names></name><role specific-use="author">Author</role><aff><institution>Montana State University</institution><addr-line><named-content content-type="city">Bozeman</named-content></addr-line><country>United States</country></aff></contrib></contrib-group></front-stub><body><p>The following is the authors’ response to the original reviews.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p><bold>Reviewer #1 (Public review):</bold></p><p>Summary:</p><p>This very thorough anatomical study addresses the innervation of the Drosophila male reproductive tract.

The functional data showing that SGNs are required for male fertility and for the release of sperm from the seminal vesicle into the ejaculatory duct is convincing.</p><p>Weaknesses:</p><p>The functional analysis of the characterized neurons is not as comprehensive as the anatomical description, and phenotypic characterization was limited to simple fertility assays. It is understandable that a full functional dissection is beyond the scope of the present work. The paper contains experiments showing neuron-independent peristaltic waves in the reproductive tract muscles, which are thematically not very well integrated into the paper. Although very interesting, one wonders if these experiments would not fit better into a future work that also explores these peristaltic waves and their interrelation with neuromodulation mechanistically.</p><p><bold>Reviewer #2 (Public review):</bold></p><p>Summary:</p><p>Cheverra et al. present a comprehensive anatomical and functional analysis of the motor neurons innervating the male reproductive tract in <italic>Drosophila melanogaster</italic>, addressing a gap in our understanding of the peripheral circuits underlying ejaculation and male fertility. They identify two classes of multi-transmitter motor neurons-OGNs (octopamine/glutamate) and SGNs (serotonin/glutamate)-with distinct innervation patterns across reproductive organs. The authors further characterize the differential expression of glutamate, octopamine, and serotonin receptors in both epithelial and muscular tissues of these organs. Behavioral assays reveal that SGNs are essential for male fertility, whereas OGNs and glutamatergic transmission are dispensable. This work provides a high-resolution map linking neuromodulatory identity to organ-specific motor control, offering a valuable framework to explore the neural basis of male reproductive function.</p><p>Strengths:</p><p>Through the use of an extensive set of GAL4 drivers and antibodies, this work successfully and precisely defines the neurons that innervate the male reproductive tract, identifying the specific organs they target and the nature of the neurotransmitters they release. It also characterizes the expression patterns and localization of the corresponding neurotransmitter receptors across different tissues. The authors describe two distinct groups of dual-identity neurons innervating the male reproductive tract: OGNs, which co-express octopamine and glutamate, and SGNs, which co-express serotonin and glutamate. They further demonstrate that the various organs within the male reproductive system differentially express receptors for these neurotransmitters. Based on these findings, the authors propose that a single neuron capable of co-releasing a fast-acting neurotransmitter alongside a slower-acting one may more effectively synchronize and stagger events that require precise timing. This, together with the differential expression of ionotropic glutamate receptors and metabotropic aminergic receptors in postsynaptic muscle tissue, adds an additional layer of complexity to the coordinated regulation of fluid secretion, organ contractility, and directional sperm movement-all contributing to the optimization of male fertility.</p><p>Weaknesses:</p><p>The main weakness of the manuscript is the lack of detail in the presentation of the results. Specifically, all microscopy image figures are missing information about the number of samples (N), and in the case of colocalization experiments, quantitative analyses are not provided. Additionally, in the first behavioral section, it would be beneficial to complement the data table with figures similar to those presented later in the manuscript for consistency and clarity.</p><p>Wider context:</p><p>This study delivers the first detailed anatomical map connecting multi-transmitter motor neurons with specific male reproductive structures. It highlights a previously unrecognized functional specialization between serotonergic and octopaminergic pathways and lays the groundwork for exploring fundamental neural mechanisms that regulate ejaculation and fertility in males. The principles uncovered here may help explain how males of Drosophila and other organisms adjust reproductive behaviors in response to environmental changes. Furthermore, by shedding light on how multi-transmitter systems operate in reproductive control, this model could provide insights into therapeutic targets for conditions such as male infertility and prostate cancer, where similar neuronal populations are involved in humans. Ultimately, this genetically accessible system serves as a powerful tool for uncovering how multi-transmitter neurons orchestrate coordinated physiological actions necessary for the functioning of complex organs.</p><p><bold>Reviewer #3 (Public review):</bold></p><p>Summary:</p><p>This work provides an overview of the motor neuron landscape in the male reproductive system. Some work had been done to elucidate the circuits of ejaculation in the spine, as well as the cord, but this work fills a gap in knowledge at the level of the reproductive organs. Using complementary approaches, the authors show that there are two types of motor neurons that are mutually exclusive: neurons that co-express octopamine and glutamate and neurons that co-express serotonin and glutamate. They also show evidence that both types of neurons express large dense core vesicles, indicating that neuropeptides play a role in male fertility. This paper provides a thorough characterization of the expression of the different glutamate, octopamine, and serotonin receptors in the different organs and tissues of the male reproductive system. The differential expression in different tissues and organs allows building initial theories on the control of emission and expulsion. Additionally, the authors characterize the expression of synaptic proteins and the neuromuscular junction sites. On a mechanistic level, the authors show that neither octopamine/glutamate neuron transmission nor glutamate transmission in serotonin/glutamate neurons is required for male fertility. This final result is quite surprising and opens up many questions on how ejaculation is coordinated.</p><p>Strengths:</p><p>This work fills an important gap in the characterization of innervation of the male reproductive system by providing an extensive characterization of the motor neurons and the potential receptors of motor neuron release. The authors show convincing evidence of glutamate/monoamine co-release and of mutual exclusivity of serotonin/glutamate and octopamine/glutamate neurons.</p><p>Weaknesses:</p><p>(1) Often, it is mentioned that the expression is higher or lower or regional without quantification or an indication of the number of samples analysed.</p><p>(2) The experiment aimed at tracking sperm in the male reproductive system is difficult to interpret when it is not assessed whether ejaculation has occurred.</p><p>(3) The experiment looking at peristaltic waves in the male organs is missing labeling of the different regions and quantification of the observed waves.</p><p><bold>Recommendations for the authors:</bold></p><p><bold>Reviewer #1 (Recommendations for the authors):</bold></p><p>(1) While the peripheral innervations are very carefully described, it is not clear to which SGNs and OGNs (i.e., cell bodies in the central nervous system) these innervations belong.

At 10 minutes, it is expected that the male has already ejaculated, and therefore, a failure to ejaculate would result in more sperm in the reproductive system, not less. Since we are not certain when the male ejaculates, it would be important to do the analysis at different time points.</p></disp-quote><p>In the Prot-GFP experiments, the 10-minute time point was chosen because we nearly always observe sperm in the ejaculatory duct of control males. In the experimental males, we never observed sperm in the ejaculatory duct at this time point. Also, no Prot-GFP sperm were observed in the reproductive tract of females mated to experimental males even when mating was allowed to go to completion, while abundant sperm were found in females mated to Prot-GFP controls. Figure 10S1 has been updated to include Images of these female reproductive systems. The results showing the absence of Prot-GFP sperm in the female reproductive tract mated to experimental males indicates sperm transfer in these males isn't occurring earlier during the copulation process than in control males and that we didn't miss it by only examining at the ejaculatory duct.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>(2) Discuss what may be the role of the octopamine/glutamate neurons and glutamate transmission in serotonin/glutamate neurons in the male reproductive system, given that they are not required for fertility (at least under the context in which it was tested).
