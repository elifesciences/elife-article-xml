Of admixed invasive individuals, those that carry endemic alleles at one of two different carotenoid biosynthesis loci also have orange fruits—characteristic of the endemic species—instead of typical red <italic>S. pimpinellifolium</italic> fruits.

Introduction events are often associated with strong genetic bottlenecks (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Kolbe et al., 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Colautti et al., 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Golani et al., 2007</xref>) and reduced effective population sizes, features which may constrain the ability of colonizers to adapt to novel environments and compete with native biota (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Lande, 1988</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Lee, 2002</xref>). This suggests that biological invasions should rarely follow from introductions (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib44">Queller, 2000</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Kolbe et al., 2004</xref>), yet successful invasions are nonetheless pervasive (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Kolbe et al., 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Allendorf and Lundquist, 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Estoup et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Comeault et al., 2020</xref>).</p><p>Several factors could be involved in this success. Despite intense bottlenecks, diversity could be maintained by other means, including multiple independent introductions (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Facon et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Kolbe et al., 2004</xref>) or via hybridization with congenerics present in the new habitat (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Ellstrand and Schierenbeck, 2000</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Lavergne and Molofsky, 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib48">Reatini and Vision, 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib58">Stepien et al., 2005</xref>). Of these mechanisms, hybridization might be particularly important for facilitating invasion into island habitats. Hybridization among native and introduced taxa is common on islands (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Carlquist, 1974</xref>), potentially because of limitations on geographic extent, the abundance of generalist pollinators (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">Olesen et al., 2002</xref>), and/or frequent anthropogenic disturbance (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Bertolo et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">Lin et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">Long et al., 2014</xref>). In addition, while the geographic isolation of insular habitats makes them hot spots for species endemism, only a small subset of continental taxa are successful in colonizing remote islands. The resulting incomplete trophic networks provide abundant ecological opportunities for invaders, including reproductive interactions between closely related species. Given these potentially complex contributing factors, describing the occurrence and consequences of invasion is critical for understanding both the dynamics of colonizing populations and for predicting conservation outcomes.</p><p>In this study, we investigate the contributions of demographic bottlenecks, single versus multiple introductions, and post-invasion hybridization, to patterns of genomic variation in populations of invasive and endemic tomato species on the Galápagos Islands. Two yellow/orange-fruited tomato species are considered endemic to the islands: <italic>Solanum cheesmaniae</italic> (L. Riley) Fosberg [CHS] and <italic>Solanum galapagense</italic> S.C. Darwin and Peralta [GAL] (<italic>Appendix 1, section S1</italic>). Two red-fruited invasive species from continental Ecuador and Peru are now also documented on the archipelago: <italic>Solanum pimpinellifolium</italic> L. [PIM] and <italic>Solanum lycopersicum</italic> L. [LYC]—the domesticated tomato. Domesticated LYC was almost certainly introduced for agriculture (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib50">Rick, 1963</xref>). Wild species PIM was also likely introduced by early human colonizers (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Darwin et al., 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Darwin, 2009</xref>), however the timing and source of this introduction is not known. Recent field surveys indicate substantially increased abundance of the invasive species while abundance of the two endemic species has markedly declined over the past two decades (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Darwin, 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">Nuez et al., 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Gibson et al., 2020</xref>), suggesting that recent demographic shifts may pose an extinction threat to the endemic species. Several factors also indicate a high potential for hybridization between native and invasive species, including overlapping habitats (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Darwin, 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">Nuez et al., 2004</xref>), similar flower morphologies (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Darwin et al., 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Darwin, 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib52">Rick et al., 1977</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib62">Vosters et al., 2014</xref>), and shared pollinators (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Darwin, 2009</xref>). Moreover, all four species are closely related—having diverged less than 500 kya (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib42">Pease et al., 2016</xref>)—and all can be crossed to produce hybrids in the greenhouse (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib49">Rick, 1956</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib53">Rick and Bowman, 1961</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib54">Rick and Fobes, 1975</xref>).</p><p>Using genomic sequencing data from 174 plants (representing all four species) from the largest islands of San Cristobal, Santa Cruz, and Isabela, and a panel of 132 mainland PIM accessions from across the entire native range on continental South America, we (i) infer the timing, source, and number of invasions by PIM onto the Galápagos and (ii) evaluate evidence for post-colonization gene flow between the four tomato taxa, and its evolutionary consequences. We find that the majority of PIM originated in central Ecuador, are the product of a recent invasion, and are actively hybridizing with an endemic relative. By characterizing fine-scale local ancestry, we find that the emergence of novel orange-fruited plants—which resemble the endemic species in color—in two invasive populations can be explained by endemic introgression at distinct carotenoid loci with known phenotypic effects specifically on fruit color. Our findings reconstruct a recent path of invasion via Ecuador, provide evidence for ongoing interspecific gene flow, and suggest a history of natural selection favoring orange fruits in the island habitat.</p></sec><sec id="s2" sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><sec id="s2-1"><title>Sequencing and collections</title><p>Sequence data were drawn from 306 individual samples.

In general, pairwise sequence divergence was lower in Galápagos-Ecuador comparisons (average d<sub>xy</sub> = 2.3×10<sup>3</sup>) than between Galápagos-Peru comparisons (average d<sub>xy</sub> = 3.6×10<sup>3</sup>; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2C</xref>), and samples showing low genome-wide divergence were clustered in central Ecuador (similar patterns were observed using F<sub>ST</sub>; <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="supp1">Supplementary file 1f</xref>).</p><p>To investigate potential source localities for invasive populations at a finer scale, we implemented the software <italic>Locator</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Battey et al., 2020</xref>) which uses a machine learning algorithm to predict sample origins from genotype data. <italic>Locator</italic> predictions indicated two to three source regions for Galápagos PIM, although the exact locations varied across runs and depended on which island PIM collections were considered (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s1">Figure 2—figure supplement 1</xref>). Santa Cruz and San Cristobal PIM collections were predicted to have originated in central Ecuador; this result was generally consistent across runs, with the consensus being an origin near Los Rios and Guayas provinces in southcentral Ecuador (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s3">Figure 2—figure supplement 3</xref>). Interestingly, we also infer that one mainland accession represents a back migration from the Galápagos to Los Rios (LA0411; <italic>Appendix 1, section S2</italic>), further highlighting the high degree of connectivity between this region and the islands. In contrast, the remaining two samples, LA3123 (a historical collection from Santa Cruz sampled in 1991) and MG128-1 (newly sampled on Isabela), were predicted to have originated in alternative locations, with most runs supporting a Peruvian origin for LA3123 and an Ecuadorian origin for MG128-1 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s3">Figure 2—figure supplement 3</xref>). The exact origin locations for these samples varied substantially across runs. In general, <italic>Locator</italic> predictions were consistent with the pattern of low pairwise sequence divergence between Galápagos PIM and central Ecuadorian samples, pointing to Ecuador, and perhaps central Ecuador in particular, as the source of the majority of invasive PIM populations on the Galápagos.</p><p>Together our data support two to three independent introductions of PIM onto the archipelago, each with variable consequences for current invasive populations: (i) a minor event from Peru [LA3123], (ii) a minor event from Ecuador [MG128-1], and (iii) a major event from central Ecuador that is responsible for nearly all sampled populations.</p></sec><sec id="s2-3"><title>Demographic reconstruction supports a recent colonization by PIM on the Galápagos</title><p>We used the allele frequency spectrum to model the demographic history of invasive populations.

Orange fruits are very rare in mainland PIM (TGRC passport data; <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://www.tgrc.ucdavis.edu">http://www.tgrc.ucdavis.edu</ext-link>) but are diagnostic of the two endemic Galápagos species.

The most likely topology inferred by <italic>Treemix</italic> implies three separate admixture events between PIM and CHS: two cases of CHS → PIM admixture and one case of PIM → CHS admixture on Santa Cruz (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3C</xref>; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s2">Figure 3—figure supplement 2</xref>; <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="supp1">Supplementary file 1k</xref>). This analysis therefore indicates repeated gene flow between PIM and CHS, although how many distinct events were involved is difficult to infer given the high genomic similarity of island PIM populations and recency of the invasion. As independent support for a history of gene flow, we calculated the four taxa D-statistic of <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Durand et al., 2011</xref> using <italic>Solanum pennellii</italic> (LA3778) as an outgroup and treating PIM population MG114 and CHS (MG115) as P2 and P3, respectively. We found that D was 0.818 (s.d. = 0.028; bootstrapped p&lt;0.02), indicating an excess of ABBA sites and strong evidence for admixture between island PIM and CHS. D was also significant when other invasive PIM populations—Santa Cruz population MG117 or San Cristobal populations MG107 and MG105—were used as P2, indicating that the detected admixture likely predates the dispersal and differentiation between Santa Cruz and San Cristobal invasive PIM. This is consistent with inferences in the <italic>Treemix</italic> graph, in which admixture events between PIM and CHS involve internal branches that subtend current San Cristobal and Santa Cruz PIM populations (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3C</xref>).</p><p>Interestingly, <italic>fastStructure</italic> and <italic>Treemix</italic> produced conflicting results regarding evidence for admixture in the polymorphic PIM populations; <italic>Treemix</italic> appears to support this while <italic>fastStructure</italic> does not. To evaluate whether this was due to differences in the detection of more subtle—and potentially older—signals of introgression, we implemented a local ancestry assignment algorithm using a Hidden Markov Model (HMM) to probe for evidence of introgression at a finer scale. Doing so, we found evidence for bidirectional gene flow between CHS and PIM (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4</xref>; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s1">Figure 4—figure supplement 1</xref>), with inferred introgression being more common in the CHS → PIM direction and in PIM populations that were polymorphic for fruit color. Our HMM detected clear evidence for CHS ancestry within the polymorphic PIM populations MG114 and MG117, reflecting admixture from CHS → PIM. In contrast, inferred admixture in nonpolymorphic PIM (e.g., MG116) was much more restricted. For MG114, CHS ancestry blocks were large (average = 16,235 kb), of varying size (sd = 139.43 kb), and composed on average 3.64% of the genomes of any given MG114 plant (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4C,D</xref>). Shared ancestry between MG114 and MG115 was dominated by two large CHS haplotypes segregating at moderate to high frequencies on chromosome three (40%; mean size = 51.35 Mb) and chromosome six (20%; mean size = 35.3 Mb; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4B</xref>). The genomic distribution of CHS ancestry blocks in different individuals indicates they are not independent. For example, on chromosome 3 all but one individual (5/6) carrying the CHS haplotype had identical breakpoints, consistent with them being derived from the same hybridization (and subsequent recombination) event and/or the individuals being closely related (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="supp1">Supplementary file 1l</xref>). In MG117, CHS ancestry made up 4.36% (sd = 2.56%) of any given MG117 genome and average block size was 9,687.5 kb (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4C,D</xref>; <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="supp1">Supplementary file 1m</xref>). As with MG114, a large CHS haplotype on chromosome six occurs at a frequency of 0.42. This block varied substantially in size in each individual, and all were discontinuous across the chromosome (i.e., there is an implied double crossover event). Further, two individuals were heterozygous for ancestry at the downstream portion of the haplotype (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s2">Figure 4—figure supplement 2</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5s1">Figure 5—figure supplement 1</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5s2">Figure 5—figure supplement 2</xref>). In comparison to MG114 and MG117, MG116 showed little evidence for shared ancestry. While 3/7 individuals had inferred signals of CHS ancestry, these blocks were generally small compared to MG114 and MG117 (average = 4,450 kb; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5</xref>) and made up a substantially smaller fraction of the total genome (average admixture proportion = 0.55%; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4D</xref>).

We can broadly estimate the age of these haplotypes using a simple logarithmic relationship (<italic>Appendix 1, section S4</italic>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">Lynch and Walsh, 1998</xref>). In MG114 and MG117, age estimates are within the range of 4–12 generations (e.g., the large chromosome 3 and 6 CHS haplotypes in MG114 are estimated at 4.23 and 4.74 generations, respectively). In addition to placing boundaries on when the initial hybridization took place in the past (&gt;4 and up to 12 generations), there is close agreement between age estimates in MG114 and MG117, suggesting that these instances of CHS introgression might have been derived from the same admixture event (<italic>Appendix 1, section S4</italic>).</p><p>Relative to the patterns of gene flow from CHS into polymorphic PIM described above, gene flow in the opposite direction (PIM → CHS) was more restricted. The average proportion of PIM ancestry within CHS individuals (at MG115) was 1.62% (s.d. = 2.72%). These results point to a potential bias in the direction of gene flow, with more exchange occurring from CHS into PIM than from PIM into CHS.</p><p>In addition to inferred introgression between PIM and CHS, we also found evidence for hybridization/introgression involving the other two taxa: GAL and LYC. In particular, we uncovered a recent history of hybridization between CHS and GAL on Isabela—at <italic>la Laguna de Manzanilla</italic> (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3B and D</xref>). These two species have been reported as co-occurring at this site since 2000, and hybridization has previously been hypothesized based on allozyme and morphological analyses (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Darwin, 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Gibson et al., 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3D</xref>; <italic>inset images</italic>). Our <italic>fastStructure</italic> and principal components analyses (PCA) of individuals at this site clearly identify nine samples as admixed (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3B</xref>), mostly corresponding with morphological classifications of intermediacy (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3D</xref>). Of the nine admixed plants, four appear to be first generation backcrosses, whereas four are F<sub>2</sub> (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="supp1">Supplementary file 1i</xref>). We also identified putative cases of CHS/GAL×LYC admixture in two populations on Isabela (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3B</xref>), although some of these signals might be the product of unmodeled genetic substructure (<italic>Appendix 1, section S5</italic>). On Santa Cruz, low levels of LYC (domesticated tomato) ancestry were also detected within some PIM populations, including a potential hybrid PIM×LYC population MG118 that was predicted to be entirely first-generation hybrids.</p></sec><sec id="s2-5"><title>An introgressed origin for orange fruits in PIM</title><p>Because introgression from CHS into PIM was most evident in PIM populations that were polymorphic for fruit color (MG114 and MG117), we took an admixture mapping approach to investigate whether introgression influences fruit color variation in these populations. Specifically, we examined the association between local ancestry across the genome and observed fruit color phenotypes, paying special attention to genomic locations of eight known genes involved in carotenoid biosynthesis (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="supp1">Supplementary file 1o and 1p</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib41">Paran and van der Knaap, 2007</xref>). For MG117, we found that the presence of orange fruits correlated perfectly with CHS ancestry at one carotenoid synthesis gene: <italic>CYC-B</italic> on chromosome 6 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5B</xref>; <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="supp1">Supplementary file 1o</xref>). This association is significant based on a χ<sup>2</sup> test of independence (χ<sup>2</sup> = 8.33; df = 1; p=0.0039). <italic>CYC-B</italic> is a lycopene beta cyclase and the specific locus known to underlie the lighter (orange) colored fruits observed in the endemic species (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib59">Stommel and Haynes, 1994</xref>).</p><p>In contrast, the similarly sized chromosome six haplotype in MG114 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4B</xref>) does not include the CHS allele at the <italic>CYC-B</italic> locus. Instead, in MG114 we find that the presence of orange fruits was solely predicted by CHS ancestry at <italic>PSY1</italic> on chromosome 3, the first enzyme in the carotenoid fruit color pathway (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="supp1">Supplementary file 1p</xref>; χ<sup>2</sup> = 11.12; df = 1; p=0.0009). Although the role of <italic>PSY1</italic> in the coloration of endemic fruits has not yet been studied, loss of function mutations in <italic>PSY1</italic> have been described in LYC and these produce orange fruit color (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Fray and Grierson, 1993</xref>). To further investigate the association of <italic>PSY1</italic> with endemic fruit pigmentation, we used previously published RNAseq data (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib42">Pease et al., 2016</xref>) to examine variation in <italic>PSY1</italic> across the entire wild tomato clade. <italic>PSY1</italic> is expressed at detectable levels in both endemic species and has a highly conserved coding sequence (1203/1239 shared sites), whose exceptions include a single non-synonymous substitution (62R → W) unique to the endemic clade (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5s3">Figure 5—figure supplement 3</xref>). This substitution lies outside of the trans-isoprenyl diphosphate synthase protein domain associated with the enzyme’s function, but within the transit peptide signal sequence (residues 1–70), although the specific functional importance of this variant remains to be assessed. Regardless, based on our observed associations between carotenoid biosynthesis loci and fruit color variation, our data support two separate mechanisms underlying the emergence of orange fruits in Galápagos PIM, both of which were likely derived via introgression from CHS.</p></sec></sec><sec id="s3" sec-type="discussion"><title>Discussion</title><p>Biological invasions are one of the foremost threats to global biodiversity, yet we still have a poor understanding of the processes that contribute to invasive colonization success. Here, we studied patterns of genome-wide ancestry and relatedness between endemic, invasive, and continental wild tomato populations in order to reconstruct the history and consequences of a recent biological invasion on the Galápagos. Invasive populations of <italic>S. pimpinellifolium</italic> (PIM) had low levels of genetic diversity and an excess of rare alleles, and we inferred two to three recent introductions onto the archipelago from Ecuador and Peru. As a consequence of this invasion, we uncovered evidence for recent and ongoing gene flow between PIM and the congeneric endemic species <italic>S. cheesmaniae</italic> (CHS). Local ancestry at two key carotenoid loci further supported an introgressed (CHS) origin for orange fruits in at least two invasive populations. Together, our results reconstruct the history of invasion, and infer that the source of convergent phenotypic evolution in the invasive populations is introgression of important functional alleles from endemic relatives.</p><sec id="s3-1"><title>Genomic data reconstruct the demographic history of invasion onto the Galápagos Islands</title><p>Our analyses identify three independent introduction events, yet only a single event from Ecuador comprises 98% of sampled invasives on the archipelago. The other two introductions—each represented by single plant collections—either did not produce large invasive populations or they result from much more recent introductions which have not yet established broadly. Indeed, our PCA (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2A</xref>) supports the idea that they are the product of more recent introduction events, as these two collections are more closely related to the mainland PIM populations than plants derived from the primary introduction.</p><p>For the primary introduction, although we observed variance in source region predictions (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s3">Figure 2—figure supplement 3</xref>), the consensus prediction supports a southcentral origin near Guayas or Los Rios provinces. Intriguingly, historical data on human migration and trade on the islands also point to this as a likely region for the source of invasive PIM. First, although Ecuadorian colonizers of the Galápagos originate from across the country, one of the earliest and largest bursts of migration coincided with the Tungurahua province earthquake in 1949 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib61">Toral-Granda et al., 2017</xref>). This province is geographically central and close to Los Rios. Second, the vast majority of all trade between Galápagos and the continent occurred—and continues to occur—from Guayaquil, the second largest city in Ecuador (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Lundh, 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib61">Toral-Granda et al., 2017</xref>). The surrounding agricultural regions, which include Los Rios, would be the most proximate sources for raw product shipments to the islands. This historical context provides additional support for our genetic inference of a majority southcentral origin for invasive populations.</p><p>Our inferences also clearly implicate humans as the source of PIM introduction. Our demographic reconstruction points to a recent bottleneck and expansion of PIM on the archipelago (<xref ref-type="table" rid="table2">Table 2</xref>), much more recent than our estimate for CHS. Similarly, our inference that LA0411 (a mainland Ecuador accession) is the product of back migration from the Galápagos underscores the recent and likely substantial human influence on the movement of PIM. We conclude that PIM is most likely the result of a recent, human-mediated expansion on the archipelago. Human introduced species represent upward of 70% of all alien plant species on the Galápagos (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib45">Quiroga, 2018</xref>), and PIM has similarly been hypothesized to be the product of a human introduction; however the timing and mode of its introduction—including the role of humans—was not previously known.</p></sec><sec id="s3-2"><title>Hybridization as a consequence of invasion onto the Galápagos</title><p>One key evolutionary consequence of PIM’s introduction onto the Galápagos that emerges from our analyses is its hybridization with endemic congeneric species—primarily CHS. Hybridization has been hypothesized as a mechanism for promoting invasive colonization success, as it could help overcome the adaptive limits that might otherwise be imposed by genetic bottlenecks during the colonization process (the so-called ‘genetic paradox’ of invasion; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Allendorf and Lundquist, 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib55">Sakai et al., 2001</xref>). These bottlenecks can be especially severe during introductions onto islands (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Kolbe et al., 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Colautti et al., 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Golani et al., 2007</xref>). In addition, several factors indicate the high potential for gene flow specifically between the four studied species (CHS, GAL, PIM, LYC), including their very close evolutionary relationships (all are members of the red-fruited Esculentum subclade within the wild tomatoes; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib42">Pease et al., 2016</xref>), and their incomplete reproductive barriers (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib49">Rick, 1956</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib53">Rick and Bowman, 1961</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib54">Rick and Fobes, 1975</xref>). Nonetheless, previous analyses based on handfuls of loci provided conflicting evidence for and against the occurrence of gene flow between species presents on the island (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">Nuez et al., 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Darwin, 2009</xref>).</p><p>Our data provide clear evidence for recent hybridization and introgression between all four tomato taxa on the archipelago. Although our focus here is primarily on CHS and PIM, we also find evidence for recent hybridization and/or introgression between CHS and PIM (Santa Cruz), PIM and LYC (Santa Cruz), CHS and GAL (Isabela), and, to a lesser extent, CHS and LYC (Isabela). These patterns suggest that hybridization—both with congeneric endemics (CHS and GAL) and invasives (LYC)—could serve as a source of adaptive genetic variation in invasive PIM.</p><p>The most prominent signal of gene flow is between PIM and CHS (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3</xref>; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4</xref>; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5</xref>), including clear evidence for both early generation (F1 and F2) hybrid offspring and older introgression 4–12 generations in the past. Our results indicate (i) that CHS ancestry is maintained in some PIM populations beyond initial hybridization and (ii) that gene flow is ongoing.</p><p>The potential consequences of secondary genetic contact are numerous (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib63">Wolf et al., 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib60">Todesco et al., 2016</xref>). While we do not have direct data on relative fitness of hybrids, the persistence of later generation CHS×PIM hybrids indicates they are not immediately selected against. Indeed, the genomes of most admixed PIM (MG114 and MG117) are consistent with a history of secondary contact and gene flow characterized not by strong hybrid incompatibility, but a less restricted exchange of alleles between species. Furthermore, the nonrandom distribution of CHS ancestry throughout admixed PIM suggests that it may be selectively maintained in certain regions of the genome. Instead of observing a heterogeneous set of CHS alleles in the backcrossed genome of PIM, we find that CHS ancestry is enriched on chromosomes 3 and 6, and absent in much of the rest of the genome, in both MG114 and MG117 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4B</xref>; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s2">Figure 4—figure supplement 2</xref>). Moreover, our local ancestry predictions provide evidence that these introgressed regions may contain key genes responsible for the emergence of orange fruit color in MG114 and MG117.</p></sec><sec id="s3-3"><title>Orange fruit color in island PIM was derived via introgression from CHS</title><p>A key finding of our analyses is that introgression is likely the source of phenotypic convergence on orange fruits that is observed in invasive Santa Cruz PIM. Orange/yellow fruit color is diagnostic for the endemic species (CHS is typically pale yellow; GAL is typically orange) but extremely rare in PIM. At the genetic level, convergence could be based on three potential sources of variation: ancestrally segregating variation, introgression, or via a de novo transition. Of these, ancestral variation is the least likely: The very few described examples of orange fruits among continental PIM are all located in Peru (e.g., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib57">Sifres et al., 2007</xref>), and none have been reported in the inferred geographic region of origin of this invasion (TGRC passport data; <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://www.tgrc.ucdavis.edu">http://www.tgrc.ucdavis.edu</ext-link>). One goal here was therefore to distinguish between introgressed and novel mutation as the source of phenotypic convergence. We did so by mapping the landscape of introgression throughout the genomes of invasive PIM plants, and evaluating its association with observed fruit color variation, and with loci known to underlie this trait in <italic>Solanum</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib41">Paran and van der Knaap, 2007</xref>). With these data we inferred a unique scenario in which phenotypic transitions to orange fruits in two different invasive PIM populations were each derived from introgression at a distinct carotenoid locus: <italic>CYC-B</italic> or <italic>PSY1</italic>.</p><p>Our data in conjunction with existing experimental evidence indicate that <italic>CYC-B</italic> is the causative locus for orange fruits in MG117. Interestingly, <italic>CYC-B</italic> mutants were first identified as natural allelic variation in the endemic species CHS (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib49">Rick, 1956</xref>). Introgression of the CHS <italic>beta</italic> allele at <italic>CYC-B</italic> into LYC causes the accumulation of β-carotene in ripening tissues and the production of orange fruits (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib59">Stommel and Haynes, 1994</xref>). Orange fruits segregate as a single dominant gene, and genotypic variation at this locus explains a large fraction of fruit color variation in experimental crosses (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib49">Rick, 1956</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib59">Stommel and Haynes, 1994</xref>). Our data show a clear association between CHS ancestry and orange fruit color at this locus (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5</xref>)—including the observation that individuals heterozygous for ancestry display the dominant phenotype—so we infer that introgression of CHS <italic>CYC-B</italic> into PIM has the same large, dominant effect on fruit color in admixed individuals of this wild species.</p><p>Unlike <italic>CYC-B</italic>, <italic>PSY1</italic> was first identified in the spontaneous fruit color mutant <italic>yellow-flesh</italic> in LYC (accession LA2997; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Fray and Grierson, 1993</xref>), and its role has not been directly evaluated in CHS or GAL. Recessive <italic>r</italic> mutants at <italic>yellow-flesh</italic> carry a truncated version of <italic>PSY1</italic> that is unable to convert precursor into phytoene. The resulting fruits accumulate almost no carotenoids and the yellow skin pigmentation is driven primarily by the accumulation of the flavonoid chaloconaringenin (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Fray and Grierson, 1993</xref>). Using previously published RNA-seq data (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib42">Pease et al., 2016</xref>), we confirmed the expression of <italic>PSY1</italic> in both endemic species and did not detect any truncation or premature stop mutations. Rather, we identified a single non-synonymous substitution (62R→W) within the transit peptide signal domain, found in both endemic species. Disruption of the transit signal sequence may prevent localization to the chloroplast and thus result in a nonfunctional enzyme, although determining the exact role <italic>PSY1</italic> has in endemic—and by extension PIM—fruit coloration would require future functional confirmation. Regardless, <italic>CYC-B</italic> and <italic>PSY1</italic> in invasive orange-fruited PIM are unequivocally derived from CHS, and current functional knowledge of both loci indicate their effects on fruit color could entirely explain observed phenotypic variation in orange-fruited PIM.</p><p>Finally, the ubiquitous lighter (orange and yellow) fruits of the two endemic species, the appearance of convergence toward endemic-like fruit colors in invasive PIM, and the likely independent recruitment of endemic fruit color alleles at <italic>PSY1</italic> and <italic>CYC-B</italic> in MG114 and MG117, together suggest intriguing evidence that lighter fruits may have a specific selective advantage on the islands. The potential environmental basis of this selection is unknown, however differences in fruit dispersal—including disperser color preference(s) and/or fruit color apparency—on the islands versus the continental mainland could be a likely mechanism. Alternatively, at least in the case of <italic>PSY1</italic> which likely involves either a full or partial loss of function, orange pigmentation could arise due to relaxed selection, if it is more costly to produce red fruits and they have no specific advantage in island environments. Future field experiments and fitness measurements will help to distinguish among these selective hypotheses.</p></sec><sec id="s3-4"><title>Conclusions</title><p>Our results reconstruct a complex and recent history of invasion by wild tomato onto the Galápagos Islands, and highlight the potential importance of gene flow during colonization. Our results also add to an emerging phenotypic convergence literature by highlighting how admixture brought on by anthropogenic change can drive convergence over very short time scales. While the adaptive benefit of orange fruits remains to be evaluated, our finding of two separate molecular mechanisms underlying orange coloration each derived from CHS is highly suggestive that lighter fruit pigmentation is favored in the island environment.

To convert from these coalescent time values to numbers of generations, we estimate N<sub>ref</sub> as θ/4 μL, where θ is the population scaled mutation parameter (estimated by <italic>δaδi</italic>; 68.40 for MG114), μ is the per-generation mutation rate (assumed here to be 1 × 10<sup>−8</sup> muts/bp/generation), and L is the length of queried sequence (5,806,952 bp; estimated from the data as the total number of bases where at least one sample in the focal population had data). Bottleneck and final effective population sizes were similarly converted from relative to absolute values using N<sub>ref</sub>.</p></sec><sec id="s4-5"><title>Inferring gene flow between contemporary island populations</title><p>We used several independent methods to characterize genetic structure in our dataset. First, we applied <italic>Treemix</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib43">Pickrell and Pritchard, 2012</xref>) to assess evidence for broad signatures of admixture among populations. Because we were interested in understanding the history of PIM, we subset our full SNP dataset to exclude LYC populations since the exact taxonomic status of these samples is unclear and does not help address questions of gene flow between PIM and endemic species. Furthermore, we remove PIM populations with fewer than eight samples. We ran <italic>Treemix</italic> with several values for m (0–8), the migration parameter which determines how many reticulation branches are allowed. Based on the likelihoods provided by <italic>Treemix</italic>, we determined that a migration parameter of 6 was most appropriate. Increasing m led us to infer more intraspecific migration within PIM, but no additional interspecific events could be inferred and the increase in data likelihood was marginal (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s2">Figure 3—figure supplement 2</xref>; <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="supp1">Supplementary file 1j</xref>).</p><p>We also employed model-based (<italic>fastStructure;</italic> <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib46">Raj et al., 2014</xref>) and non-model-based (multi-locus PCA) methods to evaluate genetic structure. We ran both methods using the LD-filtered dataset of 5767 SNPs and on each island separately. For each island, we ran <italic>fastStructure</italic> for values of k between 1 and 7. We then chose an appropriate model complexity using the <italic>chooseK.py</italic> script supplied with <italic>fastStructure</italic>. After a value for k was chosen, we evaluated the stability of the ancestry assignments across 5–10 separate runs. The multi-locus PCA was implemented in the R package <italic>adegenet</italic>.</p><p>For select populations with evidence for admixture, we ran <italic>NewHybrids</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Anderson and Thompson, 2002</xref>) to identify any early generation hybrid individuals (F<sub>1</sub>, F<sub>2</sub>, and backcrosses). <italic>NewHybrids</italic> was run using the same LD-filtered dataset as in <italic>fastStructure</italic> and PCA (script for converting from vcf to <italic>NewHybrids</italic> format is provided at <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://github.com/gibsonmatt/galtom">http://github.com/gibsonmatt/galtom</ext-link>). For each <italic>NewHybrids</italic> run, we specify three groups: a parent population A group, a parent population B group, and an admixed group. For the CHS×PIM interaction on Santa Cruz, parent populations were defined as non-admixed MG115 and MG113 individuals. For the CHS×GAL interaction on Isabela, parent populations were MG120C and MG120G. For each population, we ran the Markov chain for at least 6000 iterations. Individual assignments were not sensitive to the choice of priors. Lastly, four-sample D-statistics (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Durand et al., 2011</xref>) were calculated using the <italic>compD</italic> software package (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://github.com/stevemussmann/Comp-D">https://github.com/stevemussmann/Comp-D</ext-link>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">Mussmann, 2020</xref>), using <italic>S. pennellii</italic> (LA3778) as an outgroup species.</p></sec><sec id="s4-6"><title>Introgression analysis</title><p>We implemented an HMM to identify fine-scale genomic signatures of introgression. Although RAD sequencing is not optimal for genome scanning due to lower marker density, recent signatures of introgression should be large and detectable. Nonetheless, we acknowledge the fact that our sequencing methods may not allow for full characterization of the landscape of introgression. In our analysis we leveraged the fact that, in regions of recent introgression, genetic diversity between samples within the destination population (π) should be elevated relative to diversity between samples in the source and destination populations (d<sub>XY</sub>). In other words, regions of recent interspecific coalescence should resemble individuals from the introgressing population more than individuals in the destination population. For each pairwise comparison between samples, we thus have an estimate of π (if the samples are from the same population) or d<sub>XY</sub> (if they are from different populations) as well as the raw number of sequence differences and total sites with data.</p><p>Our HMM featured three hidden states: (i) CHS ancestry, (ii) PIM ancestry, and (iii) heterozygous CHS/PIM ancestry, for which we used π, d<sub>XY</sub>, and the mean of π and d<sub>XY</sub> (m) in nonoverlapping 100 kb windows, respectively, to calculate emission probabilities. The HMM was applied to each individual separately, using pairwise sequence comparisons between it and all other focal samples to calculate probabilities. We used three binomial models to obtain these probabilities (see <italic>Appendix 1, section S7</italic> for a detailed description of the model). For each chromosome and for each focal comparison, we found the most likely hidden state path for a given sequence of π and d<sub>XY</sub> using the Viterbi algorithm, controlling for underflow by operating in log-space. Because of the coarse scale (100 kb windows) used in ancestry assignment, our HMM struggled to identify smaller genetic signals potentially consistent with introgression. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s3">Figure 4—figure supplement 3</xref> provides a per-window look at how ancestry assignment correlated with patterns of diversity and divergence in MG114. Patterns of diversity/divergence vary substantially even between adjacent windows and thus it is likely that we are not capturing sub-100kb signals of introgression. Nonetheless, the large size of the blocks we do identify allows us to be confident they are the result of introgression rather than ILS.</p></sec></sec></body><back><ack id="ack"><title>Acknowledgements</title><p>We thank the Galápagos Science Center staff on San Cristóbal for logistic and permitting support, and the Galápagos National Park for assistance locating and sampling endemic populations.

Evidence for back migration</title><p>Based on patterns of genomic relatedness to Galápagos and surrounding PIM accessions, we infer that mainland Ecuadorian accession LA0411 (collected in 1956 by Charles Rick) is the product of a back migration from the Galápagos to mainland Ecuador. This accession showed a particularly strong resemblance to Galápagos PIM (average d<sub>xy</sub> = 0.0006) and was also divergent from neighboring mainland Los Rios accessions (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s4">Figure 2—figure supplement 4</xref>). This accession was indeed noted as morphologically similar to Galápagos PIM tomato collections when sampled on mainland Ecuador in 1956 (TGRC passport data; <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://tgrc.ucdavis.edu">http://tgrc.ucdavis.edu</ext-link>; S2.1, above). This inference has two implications for understanding the history of PIM and other invasive species on the islands. First, it sets an upper bound on the timing of the initial introduction of PIM to the Galápagos as no later than 1956, as it must have already been established there prior to a back migration event. Second, it highlights the substantial connectivity between this region (the putative source of invasive PIM) and the Galápagos in general.</p><p>This finding does not affect our analyses of invasive population origins, including our inference that most invasive PIM have an Ecuadorian source. Invasive PIM have high genetic similarity with many accessions in this region of Ecuador (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2A</xref>). Furthermore, running <italic>Locator</italic> without accession LA0411 produces results identical to those described in the main text.</p></sec></sec><sec id="s10" sec-type="appendix"><title>S3. The impact of recent introgression on demographic inferences with <italic>δaδi</italic></title><p>A recent history of introgression from CHS/GAL into invasive PIM populations could bias <italic>δaδi</italic> parameter estimates toward older dates by introducing low-frequency alleles that would incorrectly be interpreted as de novo mutations derived post-expansion. To examine this possibility, we determined whether rare alleles in MG114 were private (i.e., informative of the time since bottleneck) or shared with CHS (e.g., from introgression). We found that a large portion (52%) of singleton and doubleton SNPs in MG114 were shared with CHS (MG115), suggesting that introgressed variants could substantially affect our parameter estimates of the occurrence and timing of demographic changes within invasive PIM. For this reason, prior to model fitting we removed SNPs within all genomic regions where at least one MG114 individual had evidence for CHS ancestry based on our HMM. Any region inferred to be of CHS ancestry in any individual was removed from the dataset for all individuals. This resulted in 365 sites being filtered from the SFS relative to the original dataset.</p></sec><sec id="s11" sec-type="appendix"><title>S4. On the timing of introgression</title><p>The size of introgression blocks contains information about their age. Over time, recombination will break up contiguous blocks into smaller tracts, resulting in a mosaic of ancestry throughout the genome. We can roughly estimate the age of any given block if we assume that an initial hybridization event was followed by subsequent backcrossing to non-admixed parental individuals. Using a simple logarithmic relationship, the expected time t required to arrive at a proportion <italic>p</italic> of the donor genome after repeated backcrossing is estimated as:<disp-formula id="equ1"><mml:math id="m1"><mml:mstyle displaystyle="true" scriptlevel="0"><mml:mrow><mml:mi>log</mml:mi><mml:mo>⁡</mml:mo><mml:mrow><mml:mo>(</mml:mo><mml:mfrac><mml:mn>1</mml:mn><mml:mi mathvariant="normal">p</mml:mi></mml:mfrac><mml:mo>)</mml:mo></mml:mrow><mml:mrow><mml:mo>/</mml:mo></mml:mrow><mml:mi>log</mml:mi><mml:mo>⁡</mml:mo><mml:mrow><mml:mo>(</mml:mo><mml:mn>2</mml:mn><mml:mo>)</mml:mo></mml:mrow></mml:mrow></mml:mstyle></mml:math></disp-formula>via <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">Lynch and Walsh, 1998</xref>. As block size gets smaller, the expected time since hybridization increases.</p><p>The distribution of introgression tract sizes and the concordance of break points between blocks within and between populations are indicative of non-independence among blocks. Such a pattern makes any detailed assessment of the timing of these events difficult, and our broad estimate makes several simplifying assumptions. The occurrence of selfing and/or small population sizes may also affect the relationship between block length and age of introgression. Nonetheless, it is clear that many of the observed patterns of CHS ancestry throughout the genomes of MG114 and MG117 plants were derived from very recent (and likely shared) events. We further investigated the degree to which these histories of introgression were shared by comparing the ancestry of each population window-by-window. Specifically, we called windows of shared CHS ancestry in MG114 and MG117 as those where at least one individual in each population was assigned as CHS by our HMM. Across the genome, 250 windows were inferred to be of CHS ancestry in both populations, representing 26.8% of all CHS ancestry in MG114% and 35.4% of all CHS ancestry in MG117. These patterns imply a complex and partially shared history of admixture in MG114 and MG117. This inference is consistent with several of our other analyses, including <italic>Treemix</italic> (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4</xref>) and D-statistics which also pointed to a shared basis to detected patterns of admixture. At the resolution which we are able to assign local ancestry, our data also firmly indicate that endemic variation is maintained within PIM beyond the first or second generation of hybridization.</p></sec><sec id="s12" sec-type="appendix"><title>S5. Further details on evidence for gene flow</title><p>We use several statistical methods for detecting gene flow between invasive and endemic populations. Our primary focus was on characterizing admixture between CHS and PIM on Santa Cruz (described in text), however several additional patterns are also worth presenting. These are discussed below.</p><sec id="s12-1"><title>S5.1. Treemix</title><p>In addition to the two cases of interspecific PIM×CHS admixture, three cases of intraspecific admixture within PIM were inferred using <italic>Treemix</italic>: one from Peru PIM into Ecuador PIM, one from the ancestral Galápagos branch to MG107, and one from Ecuador PIM to MG111. It is difficult to interpret the factors responsible for these inferred events, although they may not all reflect true admixture cases. The edge between Ecuador and Peru PIM is most likely a byproduct of our distinction between these groups; in reality the relatedness among mainland samples reflects a pattern of IBD across latitude. The edges leading to MG107 and MG111 could suggest the occurrence of additional minor introduction events nested within the major Ecuador event. Such a scenario might be plausible given the known substantial trade between the Galápagos and central mainland Ecuador, and the occurrence of at least one reintroduction event. However, we have no independent support for such additional events. Increasing m in <italic>Treemix</italic> had the effect of inferring additional intraspecific migration within PIM, but did not infer any additional between species admixture (see <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s2">Figure 3—figure supplement 2</xref> for additional <italic>Treemix</italic> run summaries) and the increase in data likelihood was marginal (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="supp1">Supplementary file 1k</xref>). This indicates that the precise parameter choices in these analyses do not change the number of introgression events inferred between invasive PIM and the endemic island species, beyond those that described in the main text.</p></sec><sec id="s12-2"><title>S5.2. <italic>S. lycopersicum</italic></title><p>In addition to MG118 (population of F1 PIM×LYC plants) described in text, other weaker signals of LYC ancestry in PIM (e.g., in MG113, M114, M116, and M117; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4A</xref>) may also be the result of post-colonization admixture, however they may also represent latent (unmodeled) population structure within PIM and/or reflect the hybrid ancestry of LYC var. <italic>cerasiforme</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib47">Ranc et al., 2008</xref>). Increasing K from 3 to 4 in <italic>fastStructure</italic> swapped the minor LYC ancestry fractions seen in MG113, MG116, and MG117 for a fourth ancestry class. However, the minor LYC component seen in MG114 as well as the 50/50 LYC×PIM MG118 population retained their original LYC classifications. It is difficult to interpret this given the complex and unresolved history of LYC var. <italic>cerasiforme</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib47">Ranc et al., 2008</xref>), however it may indicate (i) the presence of two or more distinct LYC lineages on the Galápagos or (ii) a contribution by <italic>S. galapagense</italic> (GAL; not sampled on Santa Cruz but historically present). The former scenario may be expected if multiple varieties of domesticated seed have been used for cultivation on the archipelago.</p><p>Separate from the clear case of CHS×GAL admixture on Isabela at <italic>la laguna de manzanilla</italic> (discussed in the main text), additional signals of admixture between CHS/GAL (MG120)×LYC (MG122 and MG126) were also detected (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4B</xref>). In MG122, increasing K from 3 to 4 clearly separates the three inferred GAL×LYC individuals into a separate non-admixed subcluster, suggesting that the inferred GAL ancestry in these samples likely reflects latent substructure within LYC. In contrast, even when increasing K from 4 to 5, the three inferred CHS×LYC samples in MG126 retain their minority CHS component, consistent with a real signal of shared ancestry between CHS and LYC for these individuals. Whether this is the result of gene flow post-colonization of LYC on the islands or a reflection of breeding history (CHS germplasm has been used as a source for certain beneficial crop traits; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib51">Rick, 1967</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib59">Stommel and Haynes, 1994</xref>) is unclear.</p></sec></sec><sec id="s13" sec-type="appendix"><title>S6. Evaluating the potential impact of allele dropout and reference mapping bias</title><p>Allele drop out (ADO) is a potential source of bias in restriction enzyme-based genotyping protocols. When polymorphisms occur in restriction cut sites, the RAD tag can ‘drop out’, potentially masking true SNPs present in linked haplotypes. ADO can convert true heterozygous genotypes into homozygous calls. It has been well documented in simulations and real data (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Cariou et al., 2016</xref>), yet methods for dealing with it are lacking. The general observation is that, when polymorphism is high, the probability of an SNP occurring in a cut site increases, resulting in fewer true heterozygotes being identified and an overall bias toward observing lower levels of diversity.</p><p>To assess whether ADO is having a substantial effect in our dataset, we examined the relationship between sequencing depth and observed locus heterozygosity, since loci experiencing dropout are expected to be sequenced to lower depths. We observe no significant association between depth and heterozygosity (linear regression p = 0.191; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="app1fig1">Appendix 1—figure 1</xref>), indicating that ADO is unlikely to be having a pervasive effect on our data or findings.</p><fig id="app1fig1" position="float"><label>Appendix 1—figure 1.</label><caption><title>Sequencing depth (average number of reads per individual) across loci.</title><p>Panel (<bold>A</bold>) histogram of depth values.

Data missingness (the fraction of individuals at a locus without data) never exceeded 20%. We found that CHS/GAL individuals had a higher proportion of sites with 0% missing data than did PIM, although PIM overall never exceeded 10% missing data whereas CHS/GAL did for some markers (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="app1fig2">Appendix 1—figure 2</xref>). Regardless, both observations confirmed that the final marker set has low levels of missing data, which should minimize any mapping bias. We also directly examined whether read mapping was biased toward any particular species or population. We did find variation by population (but not by species) in the total number of reads mapped with BWA (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="app1fig3">Appendix 1—figure 3</xref>, right panel), but since each population had higher than 95% of reads retained in Stacks (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="app1fig3">Appendix 1—figure 3</xref>, center panel), this variation in total reads mapped actually reflects variation among populations in total sequencing output.

The current work is based on genotype information from native and introduced tomatoes on the islands as well as mainland individuals. The authors infer multiple introductions using demographic modelling and admixture/introgression between introduced and native populations, nicely highlighting that introduction histories are rarely simple.</p><p>Essential revisions:</p><p>A major concern are the potential biases inherent in the use of RAD-seq data in combination with a single reference genome. If the authors want to include the dadi analysis (which is based on the joint SFS), they must not only clearly discuss the caveats, but additional analyses must be conducted with other models. Currently, only a very limited set of models is used, with a focus on the median results in the main text – with very large CIs. One would expect the optima (reported in the text) as well as the bootstrap medians to be similar. That they are not suggests a poor fit between the data and the model. As the authors are very well aware, in these types of analyses there is always a 'best fit model' but the 'best' model is not particularly informative if it does not fit the data well.&quot;</p><p>I am including the full reviews, which provide several suggestions for how to improve the analyses / moderate the claims.</p><p><italic>Reviewer #1:</italic></p><p>Gibson and colleagues use RAD-seq genotyping data from continental and island populations of closely related Solanum species to examine population history and evidence for admixture in the Galapagos islands.

The authors genotype multiple samples from four species, including native and invasive tomatoes, and their putative mainland progenitors.

It does a very nice and clean job of testing its hypotheses using modern techniques, like dadi or Locator, but also backing them up with basic pop-gen statistics, e.g., π and dxy. The figures are well-made and thoughtful, and the methods are very well documented. I think the results are worth publishing in <italic>eLife</italic>, in particular the finding that fruit color has introgressed is an interesting story that will catch people's interests. With this in mind, I wholeheartedly endorse the paper.</p></body></sub-article><sub-article article-type="reply" id="sa2"><front-stub><article-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.64165.sa2</article-id><title-group><article-title>Author response</article-title></title-group></front-stub><body><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Essential revisions:</p><p>A major concern are the potential biases inherent in the use of RAD-seq data in combination with a single reference genome.

One would expect the optima (reported in the text) as well as the bootstrap medians to be similar. That they are not suggests a poor fit between the data and the model. As the authors are very well aware, in these types of analyses there is always a 'best fit model' but the 'best' model is not particularly informative if it does not fit the data well.&quot;</p><p>I am including the full reviews, which provide several suggestions for how to improve the analyses / moderate the claims.</p></disp-quote><p>Thank you for handing our manuscript and for the positive feedback. Below we have addressed each reviewer comment point-by-point, including detailing the text changes as well as additional analyses and figures that have been integrated in the revised submission. Broadly, these revised changes include (i) a thorough quantitative assessment of the impact of allele drop out (ADO) in our RAD seq data; (ii) a reassessment of sequence metadata to evaluate any evidence for mapping bias introduced by our use of a single reference; and (iii) correction of several errors in the dadi inference pipeline that led to exaggerated CIs. We summarize these changes below:</p><p>(i) RADseq bias: We agree that the previous manuscript could have better addressed the potential bias in RADseq data caused by allele drop out (ADO). In the revised submission, we now show evidence that genotyping errors caused by polymorphisms in restriction sites are likely not having systematic effects on our results (as detailed further in responses to reviewers below). Briefly, first we note that for species with genome-wide diversity estimates (i.e., π) below 2% (which includes our study species), previous studies (Cariou et al. 2016) indicate that the bias introduced by ADO is negligible. Second, we find no relationship between diversity metrics and sequencing depth (Appendix 1—figure 1); this would be expected if sites sequenced to lower depths experienced drop-out in our dataset. We have amended our methods section to highlight the lack of evidence for ADO (lines 598-602), added an additional supplementary text section (S6), and added Appendix 1—figures 1-3.</p><p>(ii) Mapping bias: We agree that the choice of reference genome can have a large influence on diversity metrics when studied species are distantly related. However the four species included in this manuscript are &lt; 0.5My diverged, and prior data indicate that GAL/CHS and PIM are approximately equally related to LYC (the reference species; Pease et al., 2016). Our removal of sites with greater than 20% missing data should also reduce any potential effects of mapping bias if they exist. Nonetheless, to show this more directly, we now investigate data presence/absence, numbers of recovered RAD loci, and total number of mapped reads between species/populations, each of which indicates that mapping to the domesticated tomato reference genome does not generate any consistent or substantial bias between the three wild species. We have added additional text to our methods section to highlight the absence of mapping bias (lines 598-602), provided additional supplementary figures (Appendix 1—figures 2 and 3), and a supplementary text section (S6).</p><p>(iii) Demographic models: The largest concern you bring up regards inferences from our demographic models. We agree that the large reported CIs, and the disagreement between optimized estimates and bootstrapped medians, was an unexpected element of our previous analysis, given the natural history and collection data that indirectly support our two main inferences from this analysis (recent, human-mediated introduction of PIM, and older/pre-human introduction/evolution of endemic species). In revisiting our models in response to these concerns, we found three coding errors (described in detail below) that appear to have been responsible for the unexpected difference between optimization and bootstrap runs as well as inflated variance in bootstrapped sampling distributions. After correcting these errors, our revised analyses of the timing and strength of the bottleneck in PIM now have CIs that are more narrow (see revised Table 2), and estimates from optimization and bootstrapping that are in close agreement. For MG115 (CHS), our reanalysis with corrected code indicates that CHS most likely experienced a large expansion between 1114 and 1845 generations ago (rather than a bottleneck, which was a local minimum in our optimization runs), coupled with a very recent and strong contraction. Compared to our estimate of the timing of the bottleneck in PIM, the expansion in CHS is nearly 8 times older. These corrections address the major concerns about our prior poor model fit, while still using only single population SFSs for each species, but also acknowledge that the true history of these populations is likely much more complicated. More complex models which leverage the joint SFS might be possible, but we believe these would be less appropriate for these particular populations/species. We previously constructed a joint SFS from MG114 (PIM) and MG115 (CHS) but found that most variation is actually private and not shared between the two populations (species). We believe this is a realistic consequence of inbreeding coupled with the occurrence of a strong/recent bottleneck in PIM, and indicates that models built around single population SFSs for each species are a preferable alternative to more complex model inferences, that likely go beyond the inferential power of our dataset. Instead, in the revisions we now also provide model-free support for the inferred histories in the form of bootstrapped estimates for genome-wide Tajima’s D (<italic>Table 2—figure supplement 1</italic>). These also clearly support our inference of a recent bottleneck in PIM. We have amended our Results section to reflect the updates to our demographic model fits as well as to include the updated estimates and error intervals for Tajima’s D (lines 220-223).</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Reviewer #1:</p><p>Gibson and colleagues use RAD-seq genotyping data from continental and island populations of closely related Solanum species to examine population history and evidence for admixture in the Galapagos islands. This paper combines results from those previously published (Gibson et al., 2020, Molecular Ecology, Gibson et al., 2020, Evolutionary Ecology) and adds in new genotyping and population genetic analyses. The conclusions here are that (i) the wild tomato species S. pimpinellifolium was introduced to the Galapagos in the recent past and has caused a decline in the endemic S. cheesmaniae species and S. galapagense species (which appear not to actually be separate species based on the results here) and that (ii) 'borrowed' alleles from the S. cheesmaniae (CHS) and S. galapagense (GAL) have benefitted S. pimpinellifolium in some way, enhancing its reproductive success.</p></disp-quote><p>Thank you for providing a thorough review of our manuscript. You are correct that there has been historical disagreement about the taxonomic status of the two Galapagos endemic species GAL and CHS. While the most current taxonomic treatments consider them to be separate species, past classifications have not. The distinction does not influence the major inferences from our study – with regard to invasion and introgression involving <italic>S. pimpinellifolium –</italic> so we reference the most recent and widely accepted classifications presented in Darwin et al. (2003).</p><p>We have addressed each of your comments below, which includes additional analyses, figures, and text changes where applicable.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>The results are broadly consistent with the previous findings published earlier this year both in terms of overall population structure (Gibson et al., 2020, Molecular Ecology) and the introgression of the orange fruit locus (Gibson et al., 2020, Evolutionary Ecology) and represent a clear next-step in this series of papers.</p></disp-quote><p>Thank you for taking the time to become familiar with the previous literature supporting this manuscript. We agree that data on non-invasive/mainland PIM population structure, and field observations of invasive and endemic species on the Galapagos, both help to provide a clear context for posing and answering the central questions in the current study.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>For the population genetic analyses presented, I am concerned about the potential biases introduced from RAD-seq data and in particular the strong conclusions and especially the specific time estimates regarding the migration of the S. pimpinellifolium populations. Inherent biases from this type of data and their impacts on basic population genetic parameters have been well-characterized. These were described in Gautier et al., 2013, Arnold et al., 2013, and more recently detailed in Cariou et al., BMC 2016. Arnold et al., 2013 (Mol Ecol) conducted analyses based on simulations and empirical data and found severe biases in genealogical inferences as well as population genetic summary statistics (pi, ThetaW, Tajima's D, FST). Similarly, Gautier et al., (Mol Ecol 2013) showed that allelic dropout in RAD-seq studies biases the inference of genetic variation within and between populations, which was further detailed by Cariou et al., BMC 2016.</p></disp-quote><p>Thank you for raising this concern. We agree that the manuscript could have more thoroughly addressed potential concerns about biases that can arise from RADseq data, and we have now modified this in the revised text. To clarify, the main source of bias is the potential for polymorphisms in restriction sites leading to allele drop out (ADO). As shown in the papers you cite, genotyping errors caused by ADO can lead to underestimates of SNP-based estimates of polymorphism and, as a result, can bias summary statistics generated from these data (as well as the SFS, but see response to your additional comments below). While we acknowledge this potential concern, two lines of evidence indicate that this effect does not systematically influence the results we present.</p><p>First, since ADO is dependent on the occurrence of polymorphisms in restriction cut sites, the impact of ADO is dependent on overall levels of diversity, and any potential bias should roughly scale with levels of sequence diversity. As a result, when polymorphism is low, the potential for bias is also expected to be low. Consistent with this, in their simulation and in silico digestion experiments, Cariou et al. (2016) show that, for species with genome-wide diversity estimates (i.e., π) below 2%, the bias introduced by ADO is “negligible” (pg 5). The average levels of genetic diversity in our species are substantially (an order of magnitude or more) lower than this threshold. In particular, the three wild species in our analysis have estimated average levels of heterozygosity between 0.03% and 0.04% for genome-wide coding sequences and between 0.0% and 0.01% for ultra-conserved orthologs, using high-depth (~30x or more) transcriptome data (Pease et al., 2016). Our estimates from RADseq data in the current study similarly point to extremely low levels of diversity, both on the continent (PIM heterozygosity = 0.025% – 0.033%) and on the Galapagos (PIM heterozygosity = 0.011% – 0.024%). These estimates are generally consistent with previous estimates using other non-RADseq datasets (Caicedo and Shall, 2004). These low levels of polymorphism indicate that the bias introduced by ADO is likely to be negligible in our species. We also note that ADO does not impact estimates of between population divergence (Cariou et al., 2016)</p><p>Second, we have also directly reexamined our data for evidence of a potential ADO bias by evaluating conditions under which we would expect to see this effect to be pronounced, if present (see Appendix 1—figure 1). Because high variability in depth is common in RAD datasets, it precludes any “depth-based” methods aimed at detecting ADO (e.g., the approximate Bayesian computation method presented in Cariou et al., 2016). (Indeed, depth across our filtered SNP loci is variable across the genome (Appendix 1—figure 1A) despite being very high on average (average read depth per sample = 114). To reduce this effect of variable depth, we had already filtered sites with fewer than 8 reads supporting either allele, and those where &lt;80% of samples had data.) Instead, we performed a regression of observed heterozygosity (at polymorphic sites; N = 5767) on average depth per sample (Appendix 1—figure 1B) and observe no significant association (P = 0.191), a finding that is not due to lack of power given our large sample size. If ADO was leading to significant bias across the genome, we would expect to observe an association between estimates of genetic diversity (heterozygosity) and read depth, since sites experiencing drop out will also be sequenced to lower depth. This lack of association indicates little evidence for an effect of ADO, similarly indicating that this potential bias is unlikely to impact our inferences from this data.</p><p>To address this potential concern in the revised manuscript itself, we have amended our methods section (lines 598-602) to more directly state the possible caveats of using RADseq data. We also added Appendix 1—figure 1 and a brief section (SI section S6) to our supplementary file.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Compounded with the issues known for RAD-seq, a single Solanum species is used for alignment of reads, which likely results in a further bias toward apparent lower variation in the diverged island species.</p></disp-quote><p>We agree that choice of reference genome can potentially be a source of bias when compared species are distantly diverged and/or when the species being mapped are differentially related to the reference species. However the data indicate this is not the case for the tomato species presented here. First, all four species (GAL, CHS, PIM, and LYC) are members of the same sub-clade and are less than 0.5 My diverged. Because of this very recent, rapid divergence, species relationships between the individual taxa show substantial gene tree discordance (due to ILS; Pease et al., 2016). However there is no evidence that GAL/CHS and PIM are strongly differentially related to LYC (the reference species); if anything, the data suggests a polytomy among PIM, GAL/CHS, and LYC. Second, our filtering criteria for retaining data was very strict; we removed any sites with higher than 20% missing data, which should also substantially reduce any potential effects of mapping bias.</p><p>Third, to more directly investigate any possible effects of mapping bias, we have now also compared how data presence/absence, numbers of recovered RAD loci, and total number of mapped reads varies between species/populations. Appendix 1—figure 2 indicates that data missingness (the fraction of individuals at a locus without data, indicative of failure to map and/or low quality mapping) never exceeds 20% (as expected from our filtering scheme). In these data, we find that CHS/GAL individuals had a higher proportion of sites with 0% missing data than did PIM, although PIM overall never exceeded 10% missing data whereas CHS/GAL did for some markers (Appendix 1—figure 2). Regardless, both observations confirm that final marker set has low levels of missing data, which should minimize mapping bias. We also directly examined whether read mapping was biased towards any particular species or population (Appendix 1—figure 3). We did find variation by population (but not by species) in the total number of reads mapped with BWA (Appendix 1—figure 3, right panel), but since each population had higher than 95% of reads retained in Stacks (Appendix 1—figure 3, center panel), this variation in total reads mapped actually reflects variation among populations in total sequencing output. As a net result, there is little variation among populations in the total number of assembled RAD loci (Appendix 1—figure 3, left panel), and no consistent difference between species.</p><p>From the data in Appendix 1—figures 2 and 3, we conclude that reference-based mapping to the domesticated tomato genome bias is likely not responsible for any substantial mapping bias between our three wild species, and does not explain lower variation detected in the endemic species. Instead, the latter is more consistent with the known high selfing rates in these taxa, as well as their historical endemism.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Here, the authors calculate the summary statistics that were already shown to be biased when calculated from RAD-seq data and also go further, using the joint site frequency spectrum for inference via analysis with dadi. Tajima's D is of course a summary statistic based on aspects of the SFS and if it is shown to be biased, I would expect that the numbers of variants assigned to the bins of the JSFS (used in dadi) are problematic.</p></disp-quote><p>We jointly address this comment in our response to the related comment below.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Even in the best case (i.e., full sequence data), with dadi it is easily possible to find multiple very different demographic models that fit the data equally well (for example earlier migration of fewer individuals vs. more recent migration of a larger number of individuals). Also, in this case, the CIs from the dadi analysis are extremely large, which suggests that the models examined are not very close to reality (or that there are deeper issues with bias due to the nature of the genotype data). For example, in PIM, the bootstrap median estimates for the bottleneck and recovery times are 847 generations ago and 840 generations ago, with confidence intervals of 22-13,591 generations ago for the time to recovery and 0-8000 generations ago for the time to the bottleneck. For the species considered to be island endemics, some estimates were provided but no confidence intervals from that dadi analysis were reported. Even if we are to trust there is no major bias in the RAD-seq genotyping, the dadi do not exlude an ancient natural migration of the S. pimpinellifolium species and even seem to support this possibility.</p></disp-quote><p>Thank you for clearly stating your concerns. We agree that demographic models are significantly prone to bias (given that they are idealized representations of much more complicated true histories they are always incorrect to some degree, even with perfect knowledge of the SFS) and confidence intervals are typically large. This is especially true for very recent demographic events. Uncertainty in parameter estimates is expected to increase closer to the present (Li and Durbin, 2011). Our purpose for including them was not to place hard estimates on the timing of introduction; it was instead to show (1) that we observe a clear excess of rare alleles consistent with a bottleneck model, and (2) that the relative timing of the endemic dispersal event (GAL/CHS) is likely older than the invasive dispersal event (PIM).</p><p>As stated in our responses above, our data indicate that ADO is not leading to a systematic bias in our estimates of diversity. This should also extend to the SFS. In their simulations, Arnold et al. (2013) show that ADO affects the SFS by generating an artificial deficit of rare alleles and abundance of intermediate frequency alleles. This pattern would work against the detection of past bottlenecks, so it is unlikely that our inference of bottleneck events in PIM are spuriously generated only by ADO. Genotyping errors brought on by variance in allele sequencing depth are likely a bigger concern, as are the effects of introgression. (Introgression can inject low frequency alleles into the destination population, potentially inflating the observed abundances of rare alleles.) We have mitigated the effects of erroneous genotype calls from low depth sites by using strict filtering schemes (e.g., at least 8X coverage; see methods). Similarly, before estimating the SFS for population MG114 (the population used for invasive bottleneck inference), we removed all sites with evidence for introgression as predicted by our HMM.</p><p>As you mention, potential biases introduced by genotyping errors/ADO aside, large confidence intervals might also simply be due to non-identifiability in the limited set of models evaluated. We do not disagree with this statement and have spent a substantial amount of time investigating this during our revisions, especially as the previous –comparatively poor – model fit was puzzling, given other natural history and collections data from the endemic and invasive wild species. Upon reinspection and refitting of our models, we uncovered three programming errors that had substantial effects on our parameter estimates (both in the optimization procedure and in bootstrapping). We thank you for raising questions about these results so we were prompted to catch these errors! The errors were:</p><p>1) Only a single grid size was used in dadi for approximation of the diffusion system. The dadi manual suggests that at least two grid sizes are used for proper extrapolation and this we mistakenly did not do this previously. Furthermore, our choice of grid size (30) was likely too small. We have corrected this by now using three grid sizes (30, 40, and 60) and this has substantially reduced variance between optimization runs.</p><p>2) A for loop error that resulted in improper bootstrapping. Rather than fitting each replicate using the same starting parameter values, our code mistakenly caused each replicate run to use the previous bootstrap’s model fit as its starting values. This resulted in abnormally long runs (since it quickly approached parameter bounds) and heavily inflated levels of variation between replicates.</p><p>3) An error in the dadi optimization pipeline in Portik et al. (2017) that mis-reported the optimal parameter values. It appears that there was an indexing issue in the code provided with their manuscript that led to the mismatching of parameters with their likelihoods after fitting. The reported parameters deviated slightly from the true maximum likelihood estimates. We have addressed this by implementing our own similar optimization procedure (see methods, lines 652-657).</p><p>We have now refitted all models using the corrected code. We have revised table 2 (showing parameter estimates and CIs for MG114 – the invasive PIM population)and figure S6 showing the distributions of bootstrapped estimates. During the revisions, we also compared two optimization procedures (BFGS and Nelder-Mead) to ensure that choice of algorithm was not affecting our estimates. In both cases, optimized estimates matched closely with the bootstrapped median estimates (Figure S6) and CIs for TB and TF were smaller by 15-fold or more at the upper bound compared to the previous draft. The estimate for F remained approximately unchanged.</p><p>We similarly refitted the same two-epoch model to MG115 (CHS – the endemic species) using the corrected code and performed bootstrapping (Table 2—figure supplement 2). This reanalysis suggested that CHS likely experienced a large expansion between 1114 and 1845 generations ago, coupled with a very recent and strong contraction. The extreme recency of this inferred contraction led us to evaluate additional models as well. However, optimized estimates for single epoch (one size change) as well as a three-epoch (three sizes changes) models were less likely than the two-epoch fit, and so we continue to report the two-epoch model results.</p><p>Compared to our estimate of the timing of the bottleneck in PIM, the expansion in CHS is nearly 8 times older, consistent with our understanding of the comparative introduction history of these two species based on historical and contemporary collections and natural history. We have amended our Results section to reflect the change in maximum likelihood estimates for CHS and their associated implications (lines 234-232).</p><p>We believe that these corrections address concerns of non-identifiability, especially as it appears that the large CIs were partially a technical error that arose from our prior implementation of these models. We nonetheless acknowledge that the simple models we fit are more or less rough approximations. Unfortunately, fitting more complex models (i.e., to include an ancient speciation event (between CHS and PIM), followed by separate bottlenecks + migration) would require 5-6 additional parameters, as well as estimation of the joint SFS for these two species. We have previously constructed a joint SFS but found that most variation is actually private and not shared between the two populations, suggesting that little additional information is actually contained in the 2D spectrum. We think this is a realistic consequence of inbreeding coupled with the occurrence of strong/recent bottlenecks; thus models built around single population SFSs for each species are a preferable alternative to more complex model inferences that would rely on the joint SFS. We agree with the reviewer that we do not want to go beyond the limits of our data by using it to fit models for which we have insufficient power and resolution, such as these much more complex models.</p><p>Instead, as secondary support for our broad conclusions regarding the timing and occurrence of bottlenecks, we now provide additional results (Tajima’s D) which are model-free and do not assume any particular population history. We previously provided a Tajima’s D estimate for MG114 (invasive PIM), and we now provide the same estimate for MG115 (endemic CHS) as well as bootstrapped error intervals (Table 2—figure supplement 1). In accordance with our inference of a more recent bottleneck in PIM, the median value of Tajima’s D (estimated genome-wide) in PIM (-0.49 +/- 0.24) was lower than that of CHS (-0.18 +/- 0.16) indicating a larger excess of rare alleles in PIM consistent with expansion after a recent bottleneck. We have updated text in the Results section to reflect this (lines 220-223 and 240-242).</p></body></sub-article></article>
