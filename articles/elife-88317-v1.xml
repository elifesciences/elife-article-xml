They are essential for sexual reproduction as precursors of the gametes. They also play an essential role in parasite transmission to mosquitoes. Elucidation of the gene regulation at this stage is essential for understanding these two processes at the molecular level and for developing new strategies to break the parasite lifecycle. We identified a novel <italic>Plasmodium</italic> transcription factor (TF), designated as a partner of AP2-FG or PFG. In this article, we report that this TF regulates the gene expression in female gametocytes in concert with another female-specific TF AP2-FG. Upon the disruption of <italic>PFG</italic>, majority of female-specific genes were significantly downregulated, and female gametocyte lost the ability to produce ookinetes. ChIP-seq analysis showed that it was located in the same position as AP2-FG, indicating that these two TFs form a complex. ChIP-seq analysis of PFG in <italic>AP2-FG</italic>-disrupted parasites and ChIP-seq analysis of AP2-FG in <italic>PFG</italic>-disrupted parasites demonstrated that PFG mediates the binding of AP2-FG to a ten-base motif and that AP2-FG binds another motif, GCTCA, in the absence of PFG. In promoter assays, this five-base motif was identified as another female-specific <italic>cis</italic>-acting element. Genes under the control of the two forms of AP2-FG, with or without PFG, partly overlapped; however, each form had target preferences. These results suggested that combinations of these two forms generate various expression patterns among the extensive genes expressed in female gametocytes.</p></abstract><kwd-group kwd-group-type="author-keywords"><kwd><italic>Plasmodium berghei</italic></kwd><kwd>gametocyte</kwd><kwd>female</kwd><kwd>transcription factor</kwd></kwd-group><kwd-group kwd-group-type="research-organism"><title>Research organism</title><kwd>Other</kwd></kwd-group><funding-group><award-group id="fund1"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100001691</institution-id><institution>Japan Society for the Promotion of Science</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>23H02709</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Yuda</surname><given-names>Masao</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund2"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100001691</institution-id><institution>Japan Society for the Promotion of Science</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>21K06986</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Nishi</surname><given-names>Tsubasa</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund3"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100001691</institution-id><institution>Japan Society for the Promotion of Science</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>23K06515</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Kaneko</surname><given-names>Izumi</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund4"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100001691</institution-id><institution>Japan Society for the Promotion of Science</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>17H01542</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Yuda</surname><given-names>Masao</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><funding-statement>The funders had no role in study design, data collection and interpretation, or the decision to submit the work for publication.</funding-statement></funding-group><custom-meta-group><custom-meta specific-use="meta-only"><meta-name>Author impact statement</meta-name><meta-value>Sequential expression of two transcription factors that bind to five- and ten-base female-specific <italic>cis</italic>-acting elements, respectively, promotes differentiation of <italic>Plasmodium</italic> female gametocytes.</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta specific-use="meta-only"><meta-name>publishing-route</meta-name><meta-value>prc</meta-value></custom-meta></custom-meta-group></article-meta></front><body><sec id="s1" sec-type="intro"><title>Introduction</title><p><italic>Plasmodium</italic> gametocytes are erythrocytic sexual stages essential for parasite transmission to mosquito vectors. Within the blood meal of a mosquito, female and male gametocytes egress host erythrocytes and transform into gametes for fertilization. Zygotes undergo meiotic nuclear division and develop into motile ookinetes to escape from the blood meal to the mosquito midgut epithelium. The elucidation of gene regulation during this lifecycle stage is important for developing antimalarial strategies that block transmission and prevent the spread of the disease.</p><p>Gametocytes develop from a subset of asexual erythrocytic parasites that are committed to sexual reproduction. The transition from the asexual erythrocytic stage to gametocytes occurs in late trophozoites; a subpopulation of trophozoites differentiates into gametocytes for sexual reproduction, and the rest develop into schizonts to continue asexual proliferation. Early gametocytes display no sex-specific features, but after a period of time, which is different among <italic>Plasmodium</italic> species, they start differentiating into each sex and finally become mature male and female gametocytes that are ready to transform into gametes. In <italic>Plasmodium berghei</italic>, early gametocytes manifest morphologies distinguishable from asexual stages at 18 hpi (hours post-infection of the new red blood cell) and manifest sex-specific features at 20 hpi. They then complete a sex-specific maturation process, during which a sex-specific gene expression repertoire is established, at approximately 24–26 hpi (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Mons et al., 1985</xref>). Sex-specific proteomic and transcriptomic analyses in <italic>P. berghei</italic> have revealed a number of genes specifically expressed in each sex (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Khan et al., 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">Witmer et al., 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">Yeoh et al., 2017</xref>). In females, genes necessary for fertilization and protein synthesis are expressed, and the number of transcripts is stored in an untranslated state in the cytoplasm to prepare for zygote development (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Mair et al., 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Guerreiro et al., 2014</xref>). In males, genes for flagella-based motility and genome replication are expressed, as well as genes for fertilization.</p><p>Recently, it has become clear that transcription factors (TFs) belonging to the AP2 family play a central role in sexual development. AP2-G is essential (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Sinha et al., 2014</xref>). Disruption of this gene causes the parasite to lose its ability to generate gametocytes. In <italic>P. berghei</italic>, its expression starts from the late trophozoite at 14–16 hpi and peaks at 18 hpi when sexual stage-specific features first appear (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib41">Yuda et al., 2021</xref>). <italic>P. berghei</italic> AP2-G induces hundreds of genes that contain several TFs important for the development of gametocytes, suggesting that induction of these TFs by AP2-G generates a driving force for gametocytogenesis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib41">Yuda et al., 2021</xref>).</p><p>AP2-FG is a member of the <italic>Plasmodium</italic> AP2 family of TFs and is a target genes of AP2-G (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib41">Yuda et al., 2021</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib40">Yuda et al., 2019</xref>). AP2-FG is a female-specific TF and plays an essential role in the development of female gametocytes. In <italic>P. berghei</italic>, <italic>AP2-FG</italic> is expressed from early gametocytes to mature females, and by disruption of <italic>AP2-FG</italic>, the development of the female gametocytes is impaired, showing immature morphologies and resulting in complete loss of capability to mediate parasite transmission to mosquitoes. This TF binds to a ten-base female-specific <italic>cis</italic>-acting element and regulates variety of genes including those for fertilization, meiosis, and the development of ookinetes. This broad repertoire of target genes and their essential role in female development suggest that this TF is a master regulator of female development. However, <italic>AP2-FG</italic>-disrupted parasites can produce ookinetes with decreased numbers and abnormal morphologies, suggesting that additional mechanisms for activating female-specific genes are still functional upon the disruption of <italic>AP2-FG</italic>.</p><p>We explored novel TFs for gametocyte development in the target genes of AP2-G and identified a novel female gametocyte-specific TF. In this article, we report that this TF, designated as PFG, regulates the gene expression in female gametocytes in concert with AP2-FG.</p></sec><sec id="s2" sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><sec id="s2-1"><title><italic>PFG</italic> is a target gene of AP2-G and is expressed in female gametocytes</title><p>We screened for novel sequence-specific TFs among target genes that were functionally unannotated in PlasmoDB (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://plasmodb.org/plasmo/app/">https://plasmodb.org/plasmo/app/</ext-link>) using highly conserved amino acid sequences among <italic>Plasmodium</italic> species as a criterion. We hypothesized that the amino acid sequences of DNA-binding domains of sequence-specific TFs would have been difficult to change during evolution because even a small change in the sequence specificity of TFs could cause catastrophic effects by global changes in gene expression. Through this screening, a gene encoding a 2709 amino acid protein with two regions highly conserved among <italic>Plasmodium</italic> was identified (PBANKA0902300, designated as <italic>a partner of AP2-FG</italic> [<italic>PFG</italic>]; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1A</xref>). This gene is one of the <italic>P. berghei</italic> genes that were previously identified as genes involved in female gametocyte development (named <italic>FD2</italic>), based on mass screening combined with single-cell RNA-seq (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Russell et al., 2023</xref>).

A CPW-WPC family protein gene (PBANKA_1346300) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Rao et al., 2016</xref>) harbors a ChIP-seq peak for PFG and a ten-base motif under the summit of the peak.

Female-specific genes harbor either or both of the female-specific <italic>cis</italic>-activating elements, five-base and ten-base elements in the upstream. In early female gametocytes, AP2-FG binds to a five-base <italic>cis</italic>-activating element via its AP2 domain and activates genes for gametocyte development and some genes for zygote/ookinete development. In the later stage, when PFG is highly expressed, AP2-FG is predominantly recruited to the PFG on the ten-base <italic>cis</italic>-activating element, and the AP2-FG/PFG complex activates a full repertoire of genes for zygote/ookinete development.</p></caption><graphic mimetype="image" mime-subtype="tiff" xlink:href="elife-88317-fig6-v1.tif"/></fig><p>Target prediction also showed that <italic>PFG</italic> is a target of sAP2-FG and cAP2-FG.

The log<sub>2</sub> distribution (fold change = <italic>PFG</italic>(-)/wild type) in the three groups of target genes showed that the average value was significantly higher (i.e., less downregulated) in targets unique to sAP2-FG than in the other two groups (targets unique to cAP2-FG or common targets for both), with p-values of 1.3 × 10<sup>–10</sup> and 1.4 × 10<sup>–5</sup>, respectively, by two-tailed Student’s <italic>t</italic>-test (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6F</xref>). In addition, the average log<sub>2</sub> (fold change) value of the common target genes was relatively higher (i.e., less downregulated) than that of targets unique to PFG, suggesting that transcriptional activation by sAP2-FG partly complements the impact of PFG disruption on these common target. These results suggest that the trans-activity of cAP2-FG and sAP2-FG is independent of each other.</p></sec></sec><sec id="s3" sec-type="discussion"><title>Discussion</title><p>Genes transcribed in female gametocytes are involved in various steps of parasite transmission to the mosquito vector, including sex-specific differentiation in the vertebrate host and zygote/ookinete development that take place in the mosquito vector. In a previous study, we reported that this wide range of gene expression repertoires in females is regulated directly by a female-specific TF AP2-FG that binds to a ten-base <italic>cis</italic>-acting element upstream of these genes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib40">Yuda et al., 2019</xref>). In this study, we report two findings that change our previous view. First, the binding of AP2-FG to the ten-base motif is mediated by another female-specific TF, PFG. Second, there is another <italic>cis</italic>-acting element in female-specific promoters, and AP2-FG binds to this element directly as a <italic>trans</italic>-activating factor. These findings suggest that transcriptional regulation of female-specific genes is not as simple as previously thought but is regulated by various promoters composed of different combinations of the two <italic>cis</italic>-acting elements. Considering the different expression profiles of PFG and AP2-FG, it is assumed that different expression profiles are generated among female-specific genes by the combination of these two <italic>cis</italic>-acting elements.</p><p>This study suggests that PFG is upregulated in two steps in female gametocytes; first by sAP2-FG, and then by cAP2-FG. Transcriptional activation of <italic>PFG</italic> by cAP2-FG constitutes a transcriptional positive feedback loop, suggesting that after activation by sAP2-FG, PFG maintains its transcription through this autoactivation mechanism. As the expression of PFG increases via this mechanism, AP2-FG recruited by PFG (cAP2-FG) increases and eventually becomes predominant in the transcriptional regulation of female gametocytes. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6G</xref> illustrates this model. Considering that targetome of cAP2-FG contains many ookinete genes, transcripts for ookinete development would gradually increase in transcriptome of females. In this model, it is hypothesized that binding of AP2-FG contributes to the trans-activity of cAP2-FG. This is supported by the observation that expression of many unique targets of PFG decreases in <italic>AP2-FG</italic>-disrupted parasites (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib40">Yuda et al., 2019</xref>). However, it remains elusive how AP2-FG contributes to this activity. As discussed below, PFG may have its own trans-activity for the ten-base element. It is necessary to investigate the role of AP2-FG in cAP2-FG as a next step.</p><p>In <italic>AP2-FG</italic>-disrupted parasites, while female gametocytes display immature morphologies, a few develop into retort-form ookinetes. Because PFG is essential for the parasite’s capacity to produce ookinetes, this phenotype suggests that PFG retains trans-activity in the absence of AP2-FG and partly promote ookinete development. The observation also supports this assumption that RFP signals in female gametocytes could still be detected in <italic>AP2-FG</italic>(-)<sup>820</sup> parasites by FACS (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib40">Yuda et al., 2019</xref>) even though RFP signals were reduced to undetectable level in <italic>PFG</italic>(-)<sup>820</sup> parasites under the same experimental conditions. This suggests that the promoter of the CCP2 gene, which is a target of PFG only, is still active in <italic>AP2-FG</italic>(-)<sup>820</sup> parasites. This putative trans-activity of PFG could also explain why the expression of <italic>PFG</italic> was still observed in <italic>AP2-FG</italic>-disrupted parasites. It is assumed that PFG continues to activate its transcription through a positive feedback loop once it is induced by AP2-G and complements the absence of AP2-FG. Based on this assumption and the model presented in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6G</xref>, phenotypic differences between <italic>PFG</italic>-disrupted and <italic>AP2-FG</italic>-disrupted parasites can be explained as follows. <italic>PFG</italic>(-) parasites completely lose their ability to develop into ookinetes because the expression of genes necessary for ookinete development is significantly reduced. However, they manifest mature morphologies in females owing to the induction of the genes necessary for female development by sAP2-FG. In contrast, <italic>AP2-FG</italic>(-) parasites show immature morphologies in females because the expression of genes involved in female development is downregulated in the early stage. Despite this immature morphology, they retain the ability to fertilize and develop into retort-form ookinetes because PFG is still expressed in <italic>AP2-FG</italic>(-) and activates genes for zygote/ookinete development.</p><p><italic>P. falciparum</italic> gametocytes require 9–12 d to mature, which is much longer than that of <italic>P. berghei</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Gautret and Motard, 1999</xref>). Meanwhile, it has been reported that the ten-base motif is highly enriched in the upstream regions of gametocyte-specific genes also in <italic>P. falciparum</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">Young et al., 2005</xref>). Thus, despite the difference in maturation periods, PFG is likely to play an important role in the transcriptional regulation of female gametocyte development in <italic>P. falciparum</italic>.</p><p>In conclusion, our results suggest that the two forms of AP2-FG, which correspond to distinct female-specific <italic>cis</italic>-acting elements, play pivotal roles in female gametocyte development and can generate variations among female-specific promoters. The present findings provide the possibility to predict the expression profile of each gene by analyzing its promoter sequence and further estimating its functions according to this regulation. In the next step, it will be necessary to compare the properties of the number of actual promoter activities in vivo and improve the model presented in this study. Such studies deepen our understanding of the sexual stage, including gametocyte development in erythrocytes, fertilization, meiosis, and development into ookinetes, and provide clues to interrupt parasite transmission from humans to mosquitoes.</p></sec><sec id="s4" sec-type="materials|methods"><title>Materials and methods</title><sec id="s4-1"><title>Parasite preparations</title><p>The ANKA strain of <italic>P. berghei</italic> was maintained in female BALB/c mice (6–10 wk of age).

In this study, Murata et al investigated the mechanisms of gene regulation in female gametocytes in the rodent malaria model parasite Plasmodium berghei. According to current views, gene regulation in Plasmodium parasites is dominated by the family of AP2 transcription factors (TFs), such as the AP2-G TF, which drives sexual commitment. The same authors previously identified one AP2 TF, called AP2-FG, as an essential TF mediating differentiation of female gametocytes. Here, they identified a novel protein, called PFG (for partner of AP2-FG, also described as Fd2 in a recently published study), which cooperates with AP2-FG to regulate a subset of female gametocyte genes.</p><p>PFG was identified among AP2-G targets, but possesses no known DNA binding or other characterized domain. The authors show that PFG-knockout P. berghei parasites can form male and female gametocytes yet cannot transmit to mosquitoes, due to a defect in female gametocyte development. Using RNA-seq, they show that many female-specific genes are down-regulated in PFG(-)parasites. Chromatin immunoprecipitation combined with DNA sequencing (ChIP-seq) revealed that PFG colocalizes with AP2-FG on a ten-base motif that is enriched upstream of female-specific genes. Importantly, the ChIP-seq profile of PFG is unchanged in the absence of AP2-FG, suggesting that PFG binds to DNA independently of AP2-FG. Mutation of the ten-base motif in one target gene using CRISPR-Cas9 demonstrates that this motif is required for PFG localization at the gene locus. The data also show that binding of AP2-FG is affected in the absence of PFG, with disruption of AP2-FG interaction with the ten-base motif, but conservation of AP2-FG binding to distinct five-base motifs. Using a recombinant AP2 domain from AP2-FG, the authors demonstrate that the AP2 domain of AP2-FG binds to the five-base motifs. Using CRISPR they show that disruption of the five-base motifs in the genome abrogates AP2-FG binding, and using a reporter expression system they confirm that these motifs act as a cis-activating promoter element.</p><p>Through the analysis of target genes based on the presence of the ten- versus five-base motifs, the authors propose a model where AP2-FG can function in two forms, associated or not with PFG, and acting on the ten- or five-base motifs, respectively, to regulate distinct gene subsets during development of female gametocyte development.</p><p>The paper is well written, with a clear narrative, and the work is very well performed, relying on robust molecular approaches. Generally the conclusions and the model proposed by the authors are well supported by the data. Nevertheless, the study as it stands raises a number of questions. While the data convincingly show that PFG and AP2-FG cooperate to regulate the expression of a subset of female-specific genes, the paper does not show whether the two proteins actually interact with each other to form a complex. Also, how PFG binds to DNA and whether the protein has transactivating activity remains elusive, as the protein apparently possesses no known DNA-binding or activating domain. These points could be discussed in more detail in the manuscript and/or be the subject of follow up studies.</p><p>In summary, this work reveals the essential role of a Plasmodium protein with no known DNA binding or regulatory domain, illustrating that unknown facets remain to be uncovered in this fascinating pathogen.</p></body></sub-article><sub-article article-type="referee-report" id="sa2"><front-stub><article-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.88317.3.sa2</article-id><title-group><article-title>Reviewer #2 (Public Review):</article-title></title-group><contrib-group><contrib contrib-type="author"><anonymous/><role specific-use="referee">Reviewer</role></contrib></contrib-group></front-stub><body><p>Murata et al have characterized a transcription activator previously identified in an earlier genetic screen by Russell et al (named Fd2; for female-defective 2), here named PFG. The authors show solid evidence that PFG is a partner of the previously described transcription factor AP2-FG and describe three sets of genes: genes activated by PFG or AP2-FG alone and genes activated by the complex. The authors also show differential binding to the target DNA sequences by AP2-FG to either a 10bp, if in a complex with PFG or a 5bp motif if alone. In all, this is a useful study which further elucidates the underlying regulatory network that drives development of sexual stages and ultimately transmission to mosquitoes. The data presented are clear and solid and the conclusions drawn are mostly supported by the results shown.</p><p>A few comments:</p><p>Given that the transcriptional programme is so dynamic, the timing of the ChIP-seq experiments is crucial.

I only have suggestions to improve the manuscript, to make the study more appealing or to discuss in more detail some questions raised by the work.</p><p>1. In the study as it stands, PFG seems to come out of the blue. The authors apparently selected this protein based on sequence conservation between species but this is unlikely to be sufficient to identify novel TFs. Explaining in more detail the reasoning that led to PFG would make the story more appealing. Perhaps PFG was identified through a large reverse genetics screening?</p></disp-quote><p>Response: Thank you for your suggestion. We identified this gene solely by the strategy we described in the manuscript. We decided on this strategy based on the findings of our previous study on AP2-Family TFs, whose DNA binding domains are highly conserved among Plasmodium orthologues. Using this screening strategy, we identified a novel AP2 family TF AP2-Z. The results of the present study demonstrated that this strategy is applicable to TFs other than those belonging to the AP2 family. We are aware that this strategy is not all-encompassing. In fact, we failed to identify HDP1 as a candidate TF when it was also in the target list of AP2-G. However, at present, this is our primary strategy for identifying novel TFs in the targetome.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>1. The authors propose that PFG and AP2-FG form a complex, but this is actually not shown. Did they try to document a physical interaction between the two proteins, for example using co-IP?</p></disp-quote><p>Response: Even when the two molecules were identified to be at the same position by ChIPseq, it cannot be concluded that they form a physical complex because it is possible that they competitively occupy the region. However, in this study, we performed ChIP-seq in the absence of PFG and demonstrated that the cAP2-FG peaks disappeared while those of sAP2-FG remained. This result can only be explained by the two proteins forming a complex at this region, which excludes the possibility that AP2-FG binds the region independently.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>1. It is unclear how PFG can bind to DNA in the absence of DNA-binding domain. Did the authors search for unconventional domains in the protein? This should be at least discussed in the manuscript.</p></disp-quote><p>Response: We speculate that the two highly conserved regions, region 1 and region 2, function as DNA-binding domains in PFG. However, this domain is not similar to any DNA binding domains reported thus far. A straightforward way to demonstrate this would be to perform in vitro binding assays using a recombinant protein. However, thus far, we have not succeeded in obtaining soluble recombinant proteins for these regions. We have added the following sentences to the results section.</p><p>“At present, we speculate that PFG directly interacts with genomic DNA through two highly conserved regions; region 1 and region 2. However, these regions are not similar to any DNA binding domains reported thus far. In other apicomplexan orthologues, these two domains are located adjacent to one another in the protein (Fig. 1A). Therefore, these two regions may be separated by a long interval region but constitute a DNA binding domain of PFG as a result of protein folding.”</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>1. How do the authors explain that PFG is still expressed in the absence of AP2-FG? Is AP2G alone sufficient to express sufficient levels of the protein? Is PFG down-regulated in the absence of AP2-FG?</p></disp-quote><p>Response: Our previous ChIP-seq data indicate that PFG is a target of AP2-G. According to the study by Kent et al. (2018), this gene is up-regulated in the early period following conditional AP2-G induction. The results of the present study showed that PFG is capable of autoactivation through a transcriptional positive feed-back loop. These results suggest that PFG can maintain its expression to a certain level once activated by AP2-G, even in the absence of AP2-FG. In our previous microarray analysis, significant decreases in PFG expression were not observed in AP2-FG-diaruptedparasites.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>1. How do AP2-FG regulated genes (based on RNAseq) compare with the predicted cAP2FG/sAP2-FG predicted genes (based on ChIPseq)? Are the two subsets included in the genes that are actually down-regulated in AP2-FG(-)?</p></disp-quote><p>Response: Disruption of the AP2-FG gene impairs gametocyte development. We considered that the direct effect of this disruption would be difficult to analyze in gametocyte-enriched blood, in which gametocytes are pooled during sulfadiazine treatment to deplete asexual stages. Therefore, in our previous paper, we performed microarray analysis between WT and KO parasites to detect the direct effect of AP2-FG disruption on target gene expression, using mice which were synchronously infected with parasites. According to our results, 206 genes were down-regulated in AP2-FG-disrupted parasites. Of these genes, 40 and 117 were targets of sAP2-FG and cAP2-FG, respectively. However, it is still possible that a significant proportion of genes were indirectly down-regulated by AP2-FG disruption, which may impair gametocyte development. Moreover, based on the results of the present study, expression of a significant proportion of AP2-FG target genes could be complemented by PFG transcription. We believe that it would be difficult to compare the direct effects of these TFs on gene expression via transcriptome analysis (therefore, targetome analysis is important). In this study, we compared the expression of target genes of sAP2-FG and cAP2FG between PFG(-) and WT parasites. We expected that down-regulation of PFG (cAP2FG) targets would be complemented with transcription by sAP2-FG.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>1.

To deplete any parasites in the asexual stages, all ChIP-seq experiments in this study were performed using blood from mice treated with sulfadiazine, namely, gametocyte-enriched blood. As the reviewer points out, timing is important, and samples from the period when TFs are maximally expressed are optimal for ChIP-seq. However, when parasites in the asexual stages are present, the background becomes higher. Thus we usually use gametocyte-enriched blood for ChIP-seq when expression of the TF is observed in mature gametocytes. The exception was our ChIP-seq analysis of AP2-G, because is not present in mature gametocytes.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><list list-type="bullet"><list-item><p>Fig 4c is an example of great overlap of peaks, but it would be helpful if the authors could quantify the overlaps between experiments (and describe the overlap parameters used).</p></list-item></list></disp-quote><p>Response: According to the comment, we have created a Venn diagram of overlapping peaks (attached below).

In addition, the average log2 (fold change) value of the common target genes was relatively higher (i.e., less down-regulated) than that of targets unique to PFG, suggesting that transcriptional activation by sAP2-FG partly complements the impact of PFG disruption on these common targets.”</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><list list-type="bullet"><list-item><p>Page 8, line 42: Fig 6G, not 5G</p></list-item></list></disp-quote><p>Response: Thank you for pointing this out.

The gene at the center of this study (PBANKA_0902300) was identified in an earlier genetic screen by Russell et al. as being a female specific gene with essential role in transmission and named Fd2 (for female-defective 2). Since this name entered the literature first and is equally descriptive, the Fd2 name should be used instead of PFG to maintain clarity and avoid unnecessary confusion. Surprisingly, this study is neither cited nor acknowledged despite a preprint having been available since August of 2021. This should be remedied.</p></disp-quote><p>Response: Thank you for the comment. We have added the paper by Russell et al. accordingly and mentioned the name FD2 in the revised manuscript. However, we have retained the use of PFG throughout the paper. We believe that this usage of PFG shouldn’t be confusing, as FD2 has only been used in one previous paper. We have added the following:</p><p>“Through this screening, a gene encoding a 2709 amino acid protein with two regions highly conserved among Plasmodium was identified (PBANKA0902300, designated as a partner of AP2-FG PFG; Fig. 1A).

This indicates that gametocyte development (i.e., the ability to egress the erythrocyte and to fertilize) and zygote development were both impaired. This phenotype is consistent with the observation that genes expressed in female gametocytes are broadly downregulated. PFG is a TF, and its disruption led to decreased expression of hundreds of female genes. Thus, the observed phenotype may be derived from combined decreased expression of these genes. We believe further detailed phenotypic analyses will not generate much novel information on this TF. Instead, RNA-seq data in PFG(-) parasites and the targetome have promise in helping to characterize the functions of this TF.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>1. Figure 3: what fraction of down-regulated genes have the Fd2 10mer motif?</p></disp-quote><p>Response: Thank you for the question. We investigated the upstream binding motifs of these genes. Of the 279 significantly down-regulated genes (containing 165 targets), 161 genes harbor the motif (including nine-base motifs that lack one lateral base which is likely not essential for binding) in their upstream regions (within 1,200 bp from the first methionine codon). However, this result has not been described in the revised manuscript because it is more important whether these regions harbor PFG peaks (upstream motifs can exist without being involved in the binding of PFG).</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>1. sAP2-FG (single) vs cAP2-FG (complex) nomenclature is confusing and possibly misleading since few TFs function in isolation and sAP2-FG likely functions in a complex that doesn't contain Fd2, possibly with another DNA binding protein that binds the TGCACA hexamer. The name for the distinct peaks should refer to the presence or absence of Fd2 in the complex, or maybe simply refer to them as complex A &amp; B.</p></disp-quote><p>Response: As shown in the DIP-seq analysis results, AP2-FG can bind the motif by itself. In contrast, AP2-FG must form a complex with PFG to bind to the ten-base motif. The complex and single forms are named according to this difference (the presence or absence of PFG) and used solely in its relation with PFG. We wrote “In the following, we refer to the form with PFG as cAP2-FG or the complex form, and the form without PFG as sAP2-FG or the single form.” We believe that the nomenclature has sufficient clarity. However, we have partially (underlined) revised certain sentences in the discussion section as follows.</p><p>“As the expression of PFG increases via this mechanism, AP2-FG recruited by PFG (cAP2FG) increases and eventually becomes predominant in the transcriptional regulation of female gametocytes.”</p><p>“This suggests that the promoter of the CCP2 gene, which is a target of PFG only, is still active in AP2-FG(-)820 parasites.”</p><p>We recently reported that the TGCACA motif is a cis-activation motif in early gametocytes and important for both male and female gametocyte development. Thus we speculate that sAP2-FG is not involved in cis-activation by the TGCACA motif. The p-value of the six-base motif is indeed comparable to that of the five-base motif. However, the pvalue (calculated by Fisher’s exact test) in six-base motifs tend to be lower than that calculated in five-base motifs, because the population is much large. We speculate that there is a sequence-specific TF that may be expressed in early gametocytes and bind this motif, independently of AP2-FG.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>1.

This means that at least 441 binding sites for AP2-FG independent of PFG exist. This is a straightforward conclusion from our ChIP-seq data. On the other hand, simple deduction of peaks between two ChIP-seq experiments (AP2-FG peaks minus PFG peaks) is not a precise method for determining sAP2-FG. Peak-calling is independently performed in each ChIP-seq experiment. Thus, peaks remaining after the deduction between two experiments can still contain peaks that are actually common, but which are differentially picked up through the process of peak calling. Even when using data obtained by the same ChIP-seq experiment, markedly different numbers of peaks are called according to the conditions for peak calling (in contrast, common peaks between two independent experiments increase the reliability of the data). If wanting to identify sAP2-FG peaks via comparisons between AP2-FG peaks and PFG peaks, the reviewer has to increase the number of PFG peaks by reducing the peak-calling threshold until the number of overlapping peaks between AP2-FG and PFG are saturated, and then deduce the overlapping peaks from the AP2-FG peaks. However, as described above, for the purposes of estimating the number of sAP2-FG, it would be better to perform ChIP-seq of AP2-FG in the absence of PFG.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>1. Possible explanations of why recombinant Fd2 doesn't bind the TGCACA hexamer. It would also be good to note that the GCTCA AP2-FG motif found in Fig4G is now perfect match for the motif identified by protein binding microarray in Campbell et al.</p></disp-quote><p>Response: It is not known what sequence recombinant PFG binds. The TGCACA motif is not enriched in PFG peaks. If the reviewer is referring to AP2-FG, our findings that the recombinant AP2 domain binds the five-base motif strongly suggests that other TFs recognize this motif. As described in our response to comment 9, we recently reported that TGCACA is a cis-activating sequence important for the normal development of both male and female gametocytes. Therefore, we currently speculate that this motif is a binding motif of other TFs and is independent of AP2-FG.</p><p>We have mentioned the protein binding microarray data in the Results section as follows.</p><p>“The most enriched motif matched well with the binding sequence of the AP2 domain of <italic>P. falciparum</italic> AP2-FG, which was reported by Campbell et al.”</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>1. What might explain the strong enrichment for TGCACA in ChIPseq but when pulled down by AP2-FG DBD: another binding partner? requires more of AP2-DF than just DBD?</p></disp-quote><p>Response: As described above in our response to comment 6, we have recently submitted a preprint studying the roles of the remodeler subunit PbARID in gametocyte development. We reported that the remodeler subunit is recruited to the six-base motif and that the motif is a novel cis-activation element for early gametocyte development. We speculate that a proportion of AP2-FG targets are also targets of a TF that recognizes this motif and recruits the remodeler subunit. These two TFs may be involved in the regulation of early gametocyte genes but function independently.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>1. Calling DNA pulldown with recombinant AP2-FG DNA-binding domain DNAImmunoprecipitation sequencing (DIP-seq) is confusing since there are no antibodies involved. Describing it directly as a pulldown of fragmented DNA will be clearer to the reader.</p></disp-quote><p>Response: Thank you for the comment. We have also recognized this discrepancy. However we called the method DIP-seq because the original paper reporting this method used this name, wherein it did not use antibodies to capture the MBP-fusion recombinant protein. Our experiment was performed using essentially the same methods, and thus we retained the name.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>1. The legends and methods are very sparse and should include substantially more detail.</p></disp-quote><p>Response: Thank you for the comment. We have revised the description of the FACS experimental method for clarity.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>1. BigWig files for all ChIPseq enrichment used for analysis in this study need to be provided.</p><p>(two replicates each of : Fd2 in WT, Fd2 in ∆AP2-GF, AP2-FG in WT, AP2-FG in ∆Fd2)</p></disp-quote><p>Response: We have deposited the BigWig files to GEO (GSE.226028 and GSE114096).</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>1. Tables of ChIP data need to have both summits and peaks and need to list nearest gene. Also the ChIPseq peaks for Fd2 are surprisingly broad (ChIP peaks are very large, e.g. 68% of Fd2 peaks (dataset2) are greater than 1000kb) give its specificity for a long motif. Why is this?</p></disp-quote><p>Response: We have revised Table S2 to include the nearest genes. We are unsure why peaks in the over 1000-bp peak region exist in such high proportions. However, this proportion was also high in our previous ChIP-seq data. Therefore, we speculate that this is a tendency of peak-calling by MACS2. We did not use these values in this paper. For example, targets were predicted using peak summits, and binding motifs were calculated using the 100-base regions around peak summits.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>1. Figure 5E: The positions of the 10mer and 5mer motifs in the promoter should be indicated as well as the length of the promoter. Moreover, mutation of just the 5bp motifs would be valuable to understand if 10mer is sufficient for expression of the reporter.</p></disp-quote><p>Response: Thank you for the comment. We have revised the figure accordingly. The majority of female-specific promoters only harbor ten-base motifs. Thus the ten-base motif is sufficient for evaluating reporter activity (i.e., it would function without five-base motifs).</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>1. How is AP2-FG expression affected in ∆Fd2 and vice versa?</p></disp-quote><p>Response: According to our previous microarray data, PFG expression was not significantly downregulated by disruption of AP2-FG. This may be because PFG transcriptionally activates itself through a positive feedback loop after being induced by AP2-G. Similarly, according to our present study, AP2-FG expression was not downregulated by PFG disruption. This may be because AP2-FG is transcriptionally activated by AP2-G.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>1. The single cell data in Russell et al. could easily be used to indicate the order of expression.</p></disp-quote><p>Response: Determining the expression order of gametocyte TFs via the single cell RNA-seq data from Russel et al. is difficult, because only a small number of parasite cells were considered to be in the early gametocyte stage in this study. This is because the parasites were cultured for 24h before the analysis. The analysis suggested by the reviewer may be possible via single cell RNA-seq, but the experiments must be performed with more focus on the early gametocyte stage.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>1. A discussion of the implication of <italic>P. falciparum</italic> transmission would be appreciated.</p></disp-quote><p>Response: Thank you for the comment. We have added the following to the Discussion section:</p><p>“<italic>P. falciparum</italic> gametocytes require 9-12 days to mature, which is much longer than that of P. berghei. Meanwhile, it has been reported that the ten-base motif is highly enriched in the upstream regions of female-specific genes also in <italic>P. falciparum</italic>.

The lack of identifiable DNA binding domains in Fd2 is intriguing given the strong sequence-specificity. Do the authors think they have identified a new DNA-binding fold ?</p><p>Alphafold of the orthologs with contiguous regions 1&amp;2 might offer insight.</p></disp-quote><p>Response: We speculate that these regions function as DNA binding domains. We performed analysis using Alfafold2 according to the comment. However, the predicted structure of the region was not similar to any other canonical DNA-binding domains. Thus, it may be a novel DNA-binding fold as the reviewer mentioned. Further studies such as binding assays using recombinant proteins would be necessary to confirm this, but thus far we have not successfully obtained the soluble proteins of these regions.</p></body></sub-article></article>
