acid, begins in the cytosol and is completed in the lysosomes. Acetylation of the terminal non-reducing amino group of α-D-glucosamine of HS is essential for its complete breakdown into monosaccharides and free sulfate. Heparan-α-glucosaminide <italic>N</italic>-acetyltransferase (HGSNAT), a resident of the lysosomal membrane, catalyzes this essential acetylation reaction by accepting and transferring the acetyl group from cytosolic acetyl-CoA to terminal α-D-glucosamine of HS in the lysosomal lumen. Mutation-induced dysfunction in HGSNAT causes abnormal accumulation of HS within the lysosomes and leads to an autosomal recessive neurodegenerative lysosomal storage disorder called mucopolysaccharidosis IIIC (MPS IIIC). There are no approved drugs or treatment strategies to cure or manage the symptoms of, MPS IIIC. Here, we use cryo-electron microscopy (cryo-EM) to determine a high-resolution structure of the HGSNAT-acetyl-CoA complex, the first step in the HGSNAT-catalyzed acetyltransferase reaction. In addition, we map the known MPS IIIC mutations onto the structure and elucidate the molecular basis for mutation-induced HGSNAT dysfunction.</p></abstract><kwd-group kwd-group-type="author-keywords"><kwd>N-acetyltransferase</kwd><kwd>mucopolysaccharidosis</kwd><kwd>Cryo-EM</kwd><kwd>Acetyl-CoA</kwd><kwd>lysosomes</kwd></kwd-group><kwd-group kwd-group-type="research-organism"><title>Research organism</title><kwd>Human</kwd></kwd-group><funding-group><award-group id="fund1"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100007270</institution-id><institution>University of Michigan</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>Startup funding</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Mosalaganti</surname><given-names>Shyamal</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund2"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000002</institution-id><institution>National Institutes of Health</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>1DP2GM150019-01</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Mosalaganti</surname><given-names>Shyamal</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><funding-statement>The funders had no role in study design, data collection and interpretation, or the decision to submit the work for publication.</funding-statement></funding-group><custom-meta-group><custom-meta specific-use="meta-only"><meta-name>Author impact statement</meta-name><meta-value>First high-resolution structure of HGSNAT-acetyl-CoA complex, that describes the architecture of a novel transmembrane <italic>N</italic>-acetyltransferase fold and provides a molecular basis for MPS IIIC causing mutation induced destabilization of HGSNAT.</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta specific-use="meta-only"><meta-name>publishing-route</meta-name><meta-value>prc</meta-value></custom-meta></custom-meta-group></article-meta></front><body><sec id="s1" sec-type="intro"><title>Introduction</title><p>Degradation of the extracellular matrix proteoglycans begins in the cytosol, where they are proteolyzed to GAGs such as HS, chondroitin sulfate, dermatan sulfate, and keratan sulfate. The proteolyzed GAGs are further degraded to monosaccharides and free sulfate residues within the lysosomes in GAG-specific multi-enzyme degradation pathways. Dysfunction, often inherited, of the enzymes involved in GAG degradation causes abnormal accumulation of the partial degradation products within the lysosomes, resulting in mucopolysaccharidoses (MPSs), a collective term for the group of rare autosomal recessive lysosomal storage disorders characterized by the accumulation of partially degraded GAGs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Coutinho et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Huizing and Gahl, 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">Klein et al., 1978</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib49">Platt et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib58">Ruivo et al., 2009</xref>). HS is a GAG made of repeating units of <italic>N</italic>-acetylglucosamine and glucuronic acid, and impairment of enzymes in the HS degradation pathway causes mucopolysaccharidosis III (MPS III), or Sanfilippo’s syndrome that is characterized by abnormal storage of HS degradation pathway intermediates within the lysosomes in all organs and excretion of these intermediates in the urine. The onset of the symptoms of MPS III, which include organomegaly, abnormal joint mobility, compromised cardiac function, degeneration of vision and hearing, and dementia, often begins in juveniles and ends in premature death. Currently, no therapies for MPS III are available (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Coutinho et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Huizing and Gahl, 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">McBride and Flanigan, 2021</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib51">Pshezhetsky et al., 2018</xref>).</p><p>Depending on the dysfunctional enzyme, MPS III is classified into four subtypes – MPS IIIA-IIID. Of these four MPS III subtypes, MPS IIIC (prevalence rate of 1 in 1.4 million) is caused by the dysfunction of heparan-α-glucosaminide <italic>N</italic>-acetyltransferase (HGSNAT, EC 2.3.1.78). HGSNAT is the only enzyme of the GAG pathway that is not a hydrolase. It catalyzes the only known biosynthetic reaction of the GAG degradation pathway within the lysosome, that is, the acetyl-CoA (ACO) mediated <italic>N-</italic>acetylation of the terminal non-reducing amino group of α-D-glucosamine (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Fan et al., 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Hrebícek et al., 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Huizing and Gahl, 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">Klein et al., 1978</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib44">Nagel et al., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib51">Pshezhetsky et al., 2018</xref>). Acetylation of the terminal α-D-glucosamine group is essential for subsequent HS degradation within the lysosomes. HGSNAT is not homologous to any known proteins, including acetyl-CoA binding proteins, <italic>N</italic>-acetyltransferases, and other lysosomal proteins. HGSNAT mRNA has two translation start sites (M1 and M29), yielding two functionally active isoforms (73 kDa and 70 kDa) of HGSNAT, both targeted to the lysosomal membrane (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Durand et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Fan et al., 2011</xref>). In this study, we use isoform 2 of HGSNAT, which is produced as a 635 amino acid protein containing a 30 amino acid N-terminal signal peptide, a ~110 amino acid long luminal domain, and 11 transmembrane helices (TMs). HGSNAT is believed to be expressed in the cell as an immature precursor protein that localizes as an <italic>N</italic>-glycosylated dimer on the lysosomal membrane (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Durand et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Fan et al., 2011</xref>). The localization of HGSNAT happens via the adaptor protein-mediated pathway, aided by the lysosomal targeting motifs <italic>[DE]-XXXL[LI]</italic> (<sup>204</sup>ETDRLI<sup>209</sup>) and <italic>YXXØ</italic> (<sup>624</sup>YILYRKK<sup>630</sup>) present towards the N- and C-terminus of HGSNAT, respectively (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib57">Rudnik and Damme, 2021</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib61">Schwake et al., 2013</xref>). Deleting the C-terminal lysosomal sorting signal in HGSNAT retains the protein in the plasma membrane (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Bonifacino and Traub, 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Durand et al., 2010</xref>). Once targeted to the lysosomal membrane, HGSNAT, like a few other lysosomal membrane proteins, is proteolyzed by unidentified acid proteases in the lysosomal lumen into two unequal fragments - a smaller luminal N-terminal α-HGSNAT and a larger transmembrane C-terminal β-HGSNAT that continue to co-localize despite the proteolysis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Durand et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Fan et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib57">Rudnik and Damme, 2021</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib64">Steenhuis et al., 2012</xref>). Upon proteolytic maturation, it is believed that HGSNAT is assembled as a hetero oligomer of α- &amp; β-HGSNAT chains (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Durand et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Feldhammer et al., 2009b</xref>). However, the essentiality of proteolytic cleavage and oligomerization for HGSNAT activity remains debated as endoplasmic reticulum (ER) retained monomeric HGSNAT was also shown to be active (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Durand et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Fan et al., 2011</xref>).</p><p>So far, over 70 unique mutations in the <italic>HGSNAT (TMEM76</italic>) gene have been identified. These mutations span the entire sequence and include deletions, nonsense mutations, splice-site variants, and silent and missense mutations (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Canals et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Fan et al., 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Fedele and Hopwood, 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Feldhammer et al., 2009a</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Feldhammer et al., 2009b</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Hrebícek et al., 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Huizing and Gahl, 2020</xref>). The majority of the mutations that cause MPS IIIC are missense mutations that result in HGSNAT folding and localization defects, making them ideal targets for pharmacochaperone therapy. Site-specific inhibitors of HGSNAT activity have been explored as agents to rescue the misfolded conformation of certain missense variants, thereby restoring the partial <italic>N</italic>-acetyltransferase activity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Coutinho et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Fedele and Hopwood, 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Feldhammer et al., 2009b</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib47">Pan et al., 2022</xref>). Despite its clinical relevance, the structure of HGSNAT and the mechanism of <italic>N</italic>-acetyltransferase activity are poorly understood. Here, using single-particle cryo-EM, we report the high-resolution structure of full-length HGSNAT in a complex with acetyl-CoA. This is the first structure of a member of the transmembrane acyl transferase (TmAT) superfamily (classes 9.B.97 and 9.B.169 in the Transporter Classification Database (TCDB)) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib59">Saier et al., 2021</xref>). The HGSNAT-acetyl-CoA complex structure presented here provides a high-resolution snapshot of the first step in HGSNAT catalyzed acetyltransferase reaction, and reveals critical cofactor binding amino acids in the HGSNAT active site. In addition, our structure also provides molecular insights into the impact of MPS IIIC-causing mutations on acetyl-CoA binding and the overall architecture of the protein.</p></sec><sec id="s2" sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><sec id="s2-1"><title>Purification of dimeric HGSNAT</title><p>Two groups have previously reported purification of HGSNAT in varying oligomeric forms (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Durand et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Fan et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Feldhammer et al., 2009b</xref>). The first group used non-ionic surfactants, NP-40 and Triton X-100, in their purification experiments and observed dimers and hexamers of HGSNAT. The PEG-based headgroup in these detergents is relatively bulky and yields micelles of variable sizes (45–100 kDa) and has been known to cause sample heterogeneity in eukaryotic membrane proteins (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib46">Orwick-Rydmark et al., 2016</xref>). The second group purified monomeric HGSNAT using non-ionic detergent DDM, which forms a relatively uniform, albeit large, micelle (98 kDa). However, the purification process involved two overnight incubation steps – the first in 1% and the second in 0.2% DDM. Both groups used transient transfection to express the protein in COS-7 or HeLa cells, respectively. All these factors could impact the monodispersity of purified HGSNAT. To identify the ideal conditions for expression and purification of monodisperse HGSNAT, we transfected HEK293 GnTI<sup>-</sup> cells with plasmids expressing either N-terminal or C-terminal GFP-fusion of HGSNAT and monitored GFP fluorescence in detergent-solubilized HGSNAT lysates by fluorescence-detection size-exclusion chromatography (FSEC) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">Kawate and Gouaux, 2006</xref>). We noticed that the position of GFP did not alter the expression of HGSNAT (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1A</xref>). However, the HGSNAT dimer model predicted using ColabFold suggested that the C-termini of the protomers lie at the dimer interface (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib42">Mirdita et al., 2022</xref>). Thus, for large-scale production of HGSNAT for structural studies, we expressed N-terminal StrepII-tag-GFP-HGSNAT fusion. Large quantities of GFP-HGSNAT fusion were produced using baculovirus-mediated transduction of HEK293 GnTI<sup>-</sup> cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Goehring et al., 2014</xref>). We found that reducing the temperature of the suspension cell culture to 32 °C at about 8–10 hr after transduction, or transient transfection, resulted in a better yield than continuing to grow cells at 37 °C (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1B</xref>). To identify the ideal conditions for the purification of HGSNAT, we screened various detergents. In most of the detergent conditions we tested, HGSNAT was predominantly dimeric (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1C–H</xref>). Then, we performed a single-point thermal melt test of solubilized cell lysates to compare the relative stability of HGSNAT in different detergents. The rationale is that heating should exacerbate the instability of the protein in a said condition. HGSNAT appeared most stable in digitonin (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1I–L</xref>). Based on our FSEC analysis of relative thermal stability and homogeneity, we purified HGSNAT in digitonin. We observed a dimer in our chromatography experiments and a band corresponding to a monomer on SDS-PAGE (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1M–O</xref>).</p></sec><sec id="s2-2"><title>Architecture of HGSNAT</title><p>We solved the structure of HGSNAT in complex with acetyl-CoA (HGSNAT-ACO complex) to a global resolution of 3.26 Å, with the transmembrane domain (TMD) being better resolved than the luminal domain (LD) (<xref ref-type="table" rid="table1">Table 1</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s2">Figure 1—figure supplement 2</xref>, and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s3">Figure 1—figure supplement 3A–C</xref>). This is the first experimentally determined structure of a member of the protein family (TmAT). Our structure reveals that HGSNAT is a dimer where the protomers are related to each other by twofold rotational symmetry, and the C2 axis of rotation is perpendicular to the plane of the membrane (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1A–C</xref>). Each polypeptide of HGSNAT has an N-terminal LD followed by 11 TMs that comprise the TMD, which is ensconced in the lysosomal membrane. We could model all the secondary structure elements of the protein unambiguously except the first 48 amino acids including the N-terminal signal peptide and the cytoplasmic loop 1 (CL1; L183-L236). The regions that are poorly resolved are the β-turn that connects β7 and β8 (N140-E148) the C-terminal half of TM1 (V176-F181) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1A</xref>, and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s3">Figure 1—figure supplement 3D and E</xref>). The C-terminus of the protein lies at the dimer interface but is unlikely to be directly involved in dimerization as the C-termini of the protomers lie ~25 Å away from each other, pointing towards the central acetyl-CoA binding site (ACOS) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1B and C</xref>).</p><table-wrap id="table1" position="float"><label>Table 1.</label><caption><title>Cryo-EM data

TMs 2–5, along with TM10, form a ‘catalytic core’ and enclose the ACOS accessible via the cytosol and lumen along the dimer interface. ACOSs of the protomers lie on either side of the dimer interface axis. TMs 6–9, along with TM11, form a ‘scaffold domain’ separated from the dimer interface by the catalytic core (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1E</xref>). The third luminal loop (LL3) connecting TM6 and TM7 forms a lid that limits the access to the cavity between the catalytic core and the scaffold domain from the luminal side (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1A, C and D</xref>). The TMD region comprising TM2-TM11 of HGSNAT is predicted to be evolutionarily conserved across HGSNATs from other kingdoms (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s1">Figure 2—figure supplement 1A</xref>). Owing to the unique architecture we have named this novel fold as the transmembrane N-acetyltransferase (TNAT) fold. Although the resolution for the C-terminal half of TM1 is poor, it is sufficient to position the helix separately from the rest of the TMD (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1A</xref>). TM1 is connected to TM2 by ~50 amino acid long CL1 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1D</xref>). LL1-LL3 and LL5 form the boundaries for the luminal entrance of ACOS. The C-terminus, CL2, and a part of CL1 form the boundaries of the cytosolic entrance of ACOS. The ACOS in our structure is relatively more accessible from the luminal side than the cytosolic side, as the nucleoside head group of the bound acetyl-CoA blocks the cytosolic entrance of ACOS (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1C</xref>). Thus, the HGSNAT-ACO complex is in a conformation where the active site is readily accessible for the binding of the second substrate from the lysosomal lumen.</p></sec><sec id="s2-2-2"><title>Luminal domain (LD)</title><p>The LDs of the protomers lie diagonally opposite to each other ~45 Å away from the dimer interface and are not involved in dimerization (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1B</xref>). Located between the N-terminal signal peptide and the TM1, LD is a~110 amino acids long β-sandwich made of two beta sheets of four strands each where strands β1, β4, β7, &amp; β8 form the mixed β-sheet on top (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1A–E</xref>, blue), and the strands β2, β3, β5, &amp; β6 arrange as bottom anti-parallel β-sheet (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1A–E</xref>, gray). The mixed β-sheet is arranged such that the order of the strands is β4-β1-β7-β8, with β1 &amp; β7 being parallel. β8 of LD is connected to TM1 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figures 1B, D</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">2A</xref>). LD has two predicted disulfide bonds – one in the β-turn that connects β2 and β3 (C76-C79), and the other between the strands β6 and β8 (C123-C151) holding the two sheets together. The resolution of the LD domain in our structure allows us to model only one (C76-C79) of these unambiguously (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2B</xref>). HGSNAT is produced as a pro-protein that is believed to get proteolyzed into two fragments, HGSNAT-α and HGSNAT-β, of unequal sizes, which remain together (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Durand et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Fan et al., 2011</xref>). It is unclear if HGSNAT-α is made of just LD or LD and TM1, and if HGSNAT-β is made of all TMs or only TMs2-11 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2A</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s1">Figure 2—figure supplement 1</xref>). While our structure has relatively poor local resolution at the predicted protease sites, making it difficult to map them unambiguously, the FSEC nor the SDS-PAGE analyses of the purified protein indicate that the recombinant HGSNAT is not proteolyzed (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1</xref>). We believe the relatively low local resolution of LD is because of the flexibility introduced by GFP fused to the N-term of HGSNAT.</p><fig-group><fig id="fig2" position="float"><label>Figure 2.</label><caption><title>Domain organization, and LD-TMD and dimer interfaces of heparan-α-glucosaminide N-acetyltransferase (HGSNAT).</title><p>(<bold>A</bold>) HGSNAT is predicted to be proteolyzed into two chains of unequal size - α-HGSNAT (dark magenta cartoon, gray shaded area) and β-HGSNAT (purple cartoon, yellow shaded area).

The N-terminus of TM11 interacts with the N-terminus of β1 and LL1. LL1 also interacts with the N-terminus of TM1 and the β4-β5 turn. The β2-β3 turn, including the C76-C79 disulfide, interacts extensively with LL3 and is a part of LL4. The β2-β3 turn-LL3-LL4 interaction is also stabilized by a 3π-network formed by the stacking of Y77, H78, &amp; F428 side chains. The hydrogen bond network that stabilizes the LD-TMD interaction is formed between the amino acids M51, H78, and S162 of LD with H605 and Q603, D427 and F428, and Y264 of the TMD, respectively (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2B</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s2">Figure 2—figure supplement 2A</xref>).

Although the TMs 4, 10, and 11 from both protomers lie on either side of the dimer interface, they do not directly interact to stabilize the dimer interface. The primary mediator of dimerization is the disulfide between C334s within the LL2s of each protomer (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2C</xref>, rectangle inset). In addition to the C334-C334 disulfide, the dimer interface is also stabilized by an extensiveπ-π interaction network formed between the aromatic residues of LL2 (332-340) of one protomer and the aromatic residues of LL5 (588-598) of the other protomer (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2C</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s2">Figure 2—figure supplement 2B</xref>). Notably, the aromatic bulky side chains at the interface are buried in the membrane, and the hydrophilic residues face the lumen (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2C</xref>, oval inset). Y333, L338, and S339 of LL2 from one protomer form a series of hydrogen bonds with F593 and K598 of LL5 of the other protomer, which adds to the stabilization of the dimer interface (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2C</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s2">Figure 2—figure supplement 2B</xref>). In all the detergents we tested, HGSNAT eluted as a dimer, a testimony to the extensive side-chain interaction network. The twofold rotational symmetry between the protomers juxtaposes the ACOSs of protomers connecting them with each other on the cytosolic side (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figures 1</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">2C</xref>). This interconnected space is partitioned by lipids, preventing the diffusion of ligands from one active site to the other within a dimer (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s3">Figure 2—figure supplement 3</xref>). We generated two HGSNAT mutants of residues at the dimer interface – C334A and F593A. C334 from each protomer is linked in a disulfide bond, and F593 forms hydrogen bonds with multiple residues from the opposite protomer (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2C</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s2">Figure 2—figure supplement 2B</xref>). In both these mutants, the overall expression of HGSNAT was not reduced. In the case of F593A, the stability of the dimer also remained unaffected (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s1">Figure 4—figure supplement 1A,H,I and N</xref>).

We note that the helix TM10 is bent by ~80<sup>o</sup> such that the luminal-side 2/3<sup>rd</sup> (TM10b) of the helix is parallel to TM2 and the cytosolic-side 1/3<sup>rd</sup> (TM10a) of the helix protrudes between TM2 and TM11 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3A</xref>). The bending of TM10 is aided by P575 and G576, residues are known to induce helix breaks and kinks (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Javadpour et al., 1999</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib66">Ulmschneider and Sansom, 2001</xref>). We find a density in our cryo-EM map overlapping the MOLEonline prediction in both protomers, spanning the entire length of TMD, that allowed us to unambiguously model a single acetyl-CoA, such that the 3’, 5’-ADP nucleoside head group is towards the cytosol and the acetyl group is hydrogen bonded (~3.5 Å) to N258 of TM2 that is located at the luminal entrance of ACOS. On the cytosolic side, the orientation of TM10a between TM2 and TM11 seemed to have allowed the positioning of the 3’, 5’-ADP nucleoside head group in the space created by bending away of TM10a from the central axis of the catalytic core. The catalytic H269, which is predicted to be acetylated during the acetyltransferase reaction, is ~4.5 Å away from the acetyl group of acetyl-CoA, nestled within the negative charge on the luminal opening, and is ergonomically positioned to perform acetyltransferase reaction in the presence of the acetyl group acceptor (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3A</xref>). The binding pocket, like the rest of the protein, shows a polarity of charge. As we move from the cytosolic side to the luminal side, the charge changes from positive to neutral to negative (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3B</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s1">Figure 3—figure supplement 1A and D</xref>). The cytosolic opening of the site is comprised of basic and nonpolar amino acids, making it an ideal pocket for binding the 3’, 5’-ADP head group.

HGSNAT belongs to the YeiB family. A meaningful sequence alignment could not be generated between the members of these two families.

E471 is close to the acetyl group of acetyl-CoA, and acidic to basic side chain substitution in an E471K mutation could impact the binding affinity of acetyl-CoA. N258 side chain can act as both hydrogen acceptor or donor and is hydrogen bonded to acetyl-CoA in the structure. N258I mutation could directly impact the binding of acetyl-CoA and acetyltransferase activity. R344 forms salt bridges with E469 and E471 that stabilize the luminal entrance of ACOS. The mutations of R344C/R344H could affect the integrity of the luminal entrance of ACOS. In addition to being involved in acetyl-CoA binding, all these three positions – E471, R344, and N258 – are also highly conserved (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4A and B</xref>). P283 is not directly involved in the binding of acetyl-CoA. However, the residues flanking P283 – V281, F282, F285, I288, and M289 – all interact with the pantothenate group of acetyl-CoA (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3A</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s1">Figure 3—figure supplement 1D</xref>). Proline residues define helix conformation, and mutation of a relatively conserved proline to an aliphatic leucine could alter the TM3 conformation on the luminal side and thus affect acetyl-CoA binding. FoldX prediction indicates that P283L is the most destabilizing of all ACOS mutations perhaps because it impacts the TM3 conformation. In contrast, other catalytic core mutants only show a potential to impact the binding of acetyl-CoA. We generated N258I and R344H mutants to test the effect of these substitutions on the expression and stability of HGSNAT. We noticed that these substitutions did not reduce the overall expression of HGSNAT (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s1">Figure 4—figure supplement 1A</xref>).

N273K is predicted to be least destabilizing by FoldX, as all these mutations, except N273K, result in charge reversal and drastic change in the side chain size, leading to steric clashes and breakdown of existing interactions (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figures 4B</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">2B</xref>). Although none of these missense positions at the LD-TMD interface, except C76, are directly involved in LD-TMD interface contacts, the drastic side chain changes in the vicinity of the residues directly involved are expected to destabilize the interaction (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s2">Figure 2—figure supplement 2</xref>). For example, the glycine residues (G262, G423, and G424) lie within pockets lined by aromatic side chains containing amino acids, and the substitution of such a residue with a bulky side chain will cause a steric clash, destabilizing those pockets of interaction (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4B</xref>).

It has been demonstrated, previously, that acetyl-CoA binding happens on the cytosolic side and is optimal around pH 7.0–8.0, and the acetyl transfer activity happens on the luminal side and is optimal at pH 5.5–6.0. The K<sub>m</sub> of <italic>N</italic>-acetyltransferase reaction in the presence of acetyl-CoA as the substrate is in the 0.2–0.6 mM range at pH 5–5.8, and 2.5–20 μM range at pH 7.0, suggesting that HGSNAT has a high affinity for acetyl-CoA at pH <underline>&gt;</underline>7.0 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Bame and Rome, 1985</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Bame and Rome, 1986a</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib40">Meikle et al., 1995</xref>). The transfer of the acetyl group from acetyl-CoA to the terminal non-reducing amino group of α-D-glucosamine is believed to be catalyzed by H269 located on the luminal entrance of ACOS (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3A</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s1">Figure 3—figure supplement 1</xref>). It is unclear if H269 gets acetylated and forms a stable acetylated intermediate in the process of acetyl transfer. However, for the H269 to be acetylated or for it to transfer the acetyl group to its putative acceptor, protonation of the imidazole sidechain amine group is necessary. The catalytic H269 is primarily uncharged at pH 7.5, and the acetyl-CoA remains an acetate ion. The carboxamide group of N258 can act as both an acceptor and donor in a hydrogen bond. In our structure, ACOS is more accessible from the luminal side than the cytosolic entrance. We note that the acetyl-CoA is hydrogen-bonded to N258 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3A</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s1">Figure 3—figure supplement 1D</xref>).

Because the cytosolic pH is favorable for acetyl-CoA binding and the protein we purified endogenously pulled down acetyl-CoA with it, we believe this is the most stable conformation of HGSNAT in the absence of an acetyl group acceptor. Furthermore, in our FSEC-based analysis, we noticed that H269A substitution did neither alter the expression nor stability of HGSNAT (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s1">Figure 4—figure supplement 1A,D and J</xref>). However, the N258I mutation completely destabilized HGSNAT (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s1">Figure 4—figure supplement 1A and C</xref>).

By performing acetylation and acetyltransferase reactions at different pH, and in the presence of different amino acid modification reagents, they showed that the acetylation process is optimal at pH 7, acetyltransferase activity is optimal at pH 5.5, and the amino acid on the lysosomal membrane that gets acetylated is a histidine. They proposed that the <italic>N</italic>-acetyltransferase activity follows a Ping Pong Bi Bi mechanism of reaction, where acetyl-CoA from the cytosol acetylates the active site histidine of the <italic>N</italic>-acetyltransferase located on the lysosomal membrane, inducing a conformational change in the transmembrane enzyme that enables the access of active site histidine from the luminal side (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5D</xref>). Due to the change in pH of the active site cavity, the acetyl-histidine interaction is destabilized, and the acetyl group is transferred to the α-D-glucosaminide on the luminal side (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Bame and Rome, 1985</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Bame and Rome, 1986a</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Bame and Rome, 1986b</xref>). Pshezhetsky and colleagues showed that acetylation of lysosomal membranes expressing <italic>N</italic>-acetyltransferase activity occurred even in the absence of the acetyl group acceptor, suggesting the formation of an acetylated enzyme intermediate (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Ausseil et al., 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Durand et al., 2010</xref>). Here, we purified HGSNAT at a pH favorable for acetyl-CoA binding, but not acetyl transfer reaction. In our structure, we find that the HGSNAT ACOS is more accessible via the lumen as opposed to the cytosol and that the His269 of LL1 is not acetylated. Instead, we find an acetyl-CoA molecule in the ACOS, hydrogen bonded to N258 of TM2, a residue within a close vicinity (~5 Å) of H269 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s1">Figure 3—figure supplement 1</xref>). We believe N258 holds onto acetyl-CoA and aids H269 in the acetyltransferase reaction, at low pH and in the availability of acetyl group acceptor.</p><p>Meikle and colleagues argued that the <italic>N</italic>-acetyltransferase reaction occurs via a random-order mechanism (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5C</xref>). They demonstrated that both <italic>N</italic>-acetyl-α-D-glucosamine and COA are required for the reverse reaction, suggesting that the formation of a ternary complex of acetyl-CoA, α-D-glucosamine, and the enzyme enables the reaction to proceed in a single step without the requirement of an acetylated-enzyme intermediate. They also report two K<sub>m</sub> values, that differ by 5–10 times, for both acetyl-CoA and glucosamine substrates, suggesting that both protomers, perhaps, bind to the substrates at varying affinity and only one of the protomers is catalyzing the acetyl transfer at any given point of time (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib40">Meikle et al., 1995</xref>). Mahuran and colleagues showed that acetylated enzyme intermediate could not be identified by affinity pulldown of purified transmembrane <italic>N</italic>-acetyltransferase after incubating it with [<sup>3</sup>H] acetyl-CoA and proposed that the formation of a stable acetylated enzyme intermediate is not required for the reaction to proceed (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Fan et al., 2011</xref>). Our structure does not provide evidence of H269 acetylation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3</xref>). However, we observe that acetyl-CoA binds tightly to HGSNAT endogenously resulting in a stable HGSNAT-acetyl-CoA intermediate that stayed as an intact complex all through the affinity purification, size-exclusion chromatography, and cryo-EM sample preparation steps even without the addition of exogenous acetyl-CoA to any of the buffers (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5s1">Figure 5—figure supplement 1</xref>). Perhaps, this tight endogenous binding of HGSNAT is the reason why Mahuran and colleagues could not observe the labeling of purified transmembrane <italic>N</italic>-acetyltransferase by [<sup>3</sup>H] acetyl-CoA. The structure that we obtained does not by itself settle the debate about the mechanism of HGSNAT-mediated acetylation. Our structure is in a conformation that could proceed through any of the three enzyme-catalyzed bisubtrate reaction mechanisms for acetyl transfer (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5</xref>). While we were revising our manuscript, another group published structures of apo HGSNAT and HGSNAT-ACO, HGSNAT-COA-NAG complexes. All these structures were obtained at pH 8.0 in 1% GDN and revealed no drastic conformational isomerization in the protein except for localized motion in TM2 and TM3 and residues at ACOS (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib68">Xu et al., 2024</xref>). Xu and colleagues do not show if the order of binding of the substrate is crucial for catalysis, and nor do they disprove the existence of acetylated enzyme intermediate. We believe structures of HGSNAT at lysosomal luminal pH in the presence and absence of an acetyl group acceptor will demonstrate not only if the enzyme gets acetylated during the reaction but also show if there are pH-driven conformational changes within the protein. It is also likely that the choice of detergent used determines the conformational isomerization. So, obtaining structures in membrane mimetics like nanodiscs in the presence of native HGSNAT lipids could provide a clearer insight into HGSNAT catalyzed reaction mechanism.</p><p>HGSNAT is believed to be produced as a pro-protein that gets proteolytically processed into its mature form where two fragments of unequal sizes, the α-HGSNAT and β-HGSNAT, continue to stay together because of a disulfide bond mediated interaction between C123 (β6) in the N-terminal LD of the α-HGSNAT and C434 in the LL3 of the <italic>C</italic>-terminal TMD of β-HGSNAT (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Durand et al., 2010</xref>). However, according to the structure, these amino acids are ~34 Å apart making such a bond impossibility in the acetyl-CoA bound HGSNAT conformation reported here (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figures 1A, D</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">2B</xref>). Moreover, we notice that C434 is disulfide bonded to C415 on LL3. C123 of β6 is predicted to form a disulfide bond with C151 of β8, and we do not see density to model such a disulfide. A bond between C123 of LD and C434 of LL3 could be a possibility only if there is a drastic conformational change during that brings LD closer to the LL3. Thus, we believe that the α-HGSNAT and β-HGSNAT stay together because of a series of hydrogen bonds, dipole-dipole and hydrophobic interactions between β2-β3 turn, β4-β5 turn, LL1, LL3, and LL4 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s2">Figure 2—figure supplement 2</xref>).</p><p>The protease that cleaves HGSNAT into α-HGSNAT and β-HGSNAT is unknown, and the site for proteolysis is unclear. Fan et al, proposed that the site of proteolysis is between amino acids N144 and G145 in the LD (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Fan et al., 2011</xref>). N144-G145 is located on the β7-β8 turn of the LD, a region poorly resolved in our structure (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figures 1A</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">2A</xref>). Although proteolysis at this position will cleave the LD into two parts (β1–7 and β8), the LD should remain attached to TMD because of the extensive network of interactions along the LD-TMD interface (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2B</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s2">Figure 2—figure supplement 2</xref>). Durand et al, proposed that the site of proteolysis is between the end of the luminal domain and the beginning of LL1 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Durand et al., 2010</xref>). Sequence-based protease site prediction in Procleave and Prosper servers, using the sequence between β8 of LD and LL1, suggests multiple potential sites of proteolysis, for example, L154-A155 at the C-term of β8, S162-N163 in the loop connecting LD to TM1, F170-L171 at the N-term of TM1, L187-S188, and W231-R232 at the N- and C-term of the CL1 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">Li et al., 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib63">Song et al., 2012</xref>). It is hard to speculate which of these are most probable, as the lysosomes are rich in aspartic, serine, and cysteine proteases, including intra-membrane proteases that are involved in protein degradation and proprotein processing. In addition, some matrix metalloproteinases have also been shown to act in intracellular compartments and have been implicated in MPS diseases (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Batzios et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Jobin et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib43">Müller et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib60">Schröder and Saftig, 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib65">Turk et al., 2000</xref>). The recombinant HGSNAT that we produced is a non-proteolyzed form of HGSNAT, as we see a band corresponding to full-length HGSNAT in our SDS-PAGE analysis and a peak corresponding to an intact full-length dimer in our FSEC analysis. HGSNAT is encoded by 18 exons, where the first 6 exons encode an N-terminal LD &amp; TM1, which are only present in the metazoans. The remaining 10 TMs and the C-terminus are well conserved in archaea, bacteria, and plants (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Fan et al., 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Hrebícek et al., 2006</xref>). Based on the evolutionary sequence and structure conservation and conformational flexibility observed in CL1, we speculate that LD &amp; TM1 together form α-HGSNAT and TMs 2–11 form β-HGSNAT (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figures 2A</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">4A</xref>, and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s1">Figure 2—figure supplement 1A</xref>).</p><p>There are no known homologs of the LD, and even the strand arrangement in two sheets appears to be rare (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Koch et al., 1992</xref>). A structure-based search in the Dali server lists hits with &lt;15% identity, with immunoglobulin-like &amp; transthyretin folds as top hits (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="supp1">Supplementary file 1</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Beale et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Felisberto-Rodrigues et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib48">Parker et al., 2021</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib54">Rajasekar et al., 2019</xref>). Unlike the LD, a typical immunoglobulin-like fold is a disulfide-containing β-sandwich made of 7–9 β-strands arranged in two anti-parallel β-sheets, with a conserved core formed by four strands β2, β3, β5, &amp; β6 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s1">Figure 2—figure supplement 1C and D</xref>). In the Ig-like fold, the β2 and β5 strands are in one sheet, and the β3 and β6 strands are in the second one, with β2 and β6 being linked by a disulfide bond. The remaining 3–5 strands comprise the remaining variable region of the Ig-like fold (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Bork et al., 1994</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Chidyausiku et al., 2022</xref>). Although the % identity of LD and the transthyretin fold containing hits is &lt;15%, the strand composition of the two sheets that make the β-sandwich is identical. However, a typical transthyretin fold contains a conserved short α-helix between β5 &amp; β6 and often does not contain disulfide bonds (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s1">Figure 2—figure supplement 1C and D</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Hörnberg et al., 2000</xref>). Another β-sandwich that shows a similar secondary structure assignment as LD is the type-II C2 domain, where the top sheet is made of β1, β4, β7, &amp; β8 strands while the bottom sheet is made of β2, β3, β5, &amp; β6 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Hirano et al., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">Kretsinger et al., 2013</xref>). However, both sheets in the type-II C2 domain are anti-parallel, and the arrangement of the top strand is β4-β1-β8-β7. In LD, one sheet is anti-parallel, and the other is a mixed sheet where the arrangement in the top sheet is β4-β1-β7-β8 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s1">Figure 2—figure supplement 1C and D</xref>). Because of these non-trivial dissimilarities of LD with three major types of β-sandwiches, we believe that LD is a new fold of β-sandwich that could be best described as a ‘transthyretin-like’ fold. In fact, two proteins in the top hits from a structure-based similarity search on the Dali server show the same sheet arrangement as LD (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="supp1">Supplementary file 1</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s1">Figure 2—figure supplement 1D</xref>). One of these proteins is AlgF (PDB ID: 6CZT), an adaptor protein from Pseudomonas believed to be involved in O-acetylation of alginate exopolysaccharides and the other is an SPH (self-incompatibility protein homolog) domain (PDB ID: 6G7G) that is described as transthyretin-like and is believed to be a plant secreted protein involved in cell death (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s1">Figure 2—figure supplement 1D</xref>).</p><p>The function of LD remains unknown. DeepSite predicts the presence of two ligand binding sites in HGSNAT, one that overlaps with the ACOS and the other in the cavity between the two sheets of LD (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s1">Figure 3—figure supplement 1B</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Jiménez et al., 2017</xref>). However, it is unclear if LD binds to a ligand and/or a metal ion. It has been shown that the <italic>N</italic>-acetyltransferase activity of HGSNAT is enhanced in the presence of anionic phospholipids (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Fan et al., 2011</xref>). However, we expect lipids to bind towards the cytosolic side at the dimer interface. We see unexplained density in these regions that could be best explained as ordered lipids or digitonin (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s3">Figure 2—figure supplement 3</xref>). A recent report of a computational modeling and molecular dynamics simulation study conducted on a model of OafB, a bacterial O-antigen modifying transmembrane acetyltransferase of the ATAT family within the TmAT superfamily, showed that the periplasmic SGNH domain undergoes large conformational changes and aid in O-antigen acetylation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib45">Newman et al., 2023</xref>). OafB has two domains – the transmembrane acetyltransferase-3 domain (AT-3) and the periplasmic SGNH domain. Although the domain organization is similar to HGSNAT, there are marked differences in the structure (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s1">Figure 2—figure supplement 1B</xref>). AT-3 domain and HGSNAT TMD are not homologous, even though they share a similar architecture to the ACOS. The LD of HGSNAT is different from the SGNH domain, in the sense that LD is a β-sandwich at the N-terminus of the protein while SGNH is a α-β-α sandwich with a single β-sheet sandwiched between two helical domains at the C-terminus of the protein. There are non-trivial differences between the predicted structures of ATAT and YeiB family members. However, it is possible that the TMDs and the extra-membranous domains function similarly. It is likely that LD of HGSNAT binds to HS, stabilizing the terminal non-reducing sugar of HS near the luminal side of ACOS for catalysis and remains to be structurally investigated. In fact, it has been shown that as the size of the acetyl group acceptor was increased in an acetyltransferase reaction from mono- to di- to tetra-saccharide, the K<sub>m</sub> values decreased from 0.6 mM to 7 μM (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib40">Meikle et al., 1995</xref>).</p><p>The high-resolution structure of HGSNAT reported in this study heralds a new beginning for structural exploration of the TmAT superfamily. The conformation of HGSNAT observed in our cryo-EM studies does not put to rest the debate on the kind of bi-substrate reaction mechanism that HGSNAT follows to catalyze the acetyl transfer. However, our structure underscores the requirement to characterize the remaining states of the enzymatic reaction. The molecular basis we delineated for the mutation-induced dysfunction in HGSNAT will serve as a blueprint for the structure-based design of novel therapeutic modulators that could rescue the function of milder variants.</p></sec><sec id="s4" sec-type="materials|methods"><title>Materials and methods</title><table-wrap id="keyresource" position="anchor"><label>Key resources table</label><table

of full-length human HGSNAT was synthesized by GenScript. The synthesized gene was then cloned into the pEG BacMam expression vector (Addgene plasmid # 160683) between EcoRI and NotI restriction sites, to be expressed via baculoviral transduction in HEK293S GnTI<sup>-</sup> cells (ATCC # CRL-3022) as a fusion protein containing an N-terminal Strep-tag-II-GFP. The integrity of the clone was confirmed by Sanger sequencing (Plasmidsaurus, OR). HGSNAT variants discussed in the manuscript were prepared in the pEG BacMam expression vector background by GenScript.</p></sec><sec id="s4-2"><title>Cell culturing, transient transfection, and transduction</title><p>Adherent HEK293S GnTI<sup>-</sup> cells were grown in Dulbecco’s Modified Eagle Medium (DMEM, Croning) supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum (FBS, Gibco) at 37 °C. Immediately preceding transfection, the cells were washed with 1 X PBS (Gibco) and supplied with fresh pre-warmed DMEM containing 10% FBS. 1×10<sup>6</sup> cells were transfected with 1 μg DNA using TurboFect (Thermo Fisher Scientific) suspended in serum-free DMEM as suggested by the manufacturer’s protocol. The transfected cells were grown at 37 °C and 5% CO<sub>2</sub> for 8–10 hr. The cell-culture media was then replaced with fresh pre-warmed DMEM containing 10% FBS and 10 mM of sodium butyrate, and the cells were grown at 32 °C and 5% CO<sub>2</sub> for an additional 24–36 hr, before harvesting. All transfections were done at 80% confluency. Transfected cells were used to screen for ideal expression and purification conditions.</p><p>Baculovirus preparation was done as described by Goehring and colleagues (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Goehring et al., 2014</xref>). Briefly, DH10Bac cells (Thermo Fisher Scientific) were transformed with an HGSNAT expression vector, and lacZ<sup>-</sup> colonies were selected on gentamycin-kanamycin-tetracycline LB agar plates for bacmid DNA isolation. 1×10<sup>6</sup> adherent Sf9 cells (Gibco # 12659017) grown in serum-free Sf-900 III media (Gibco) were transfected with 1 μg of bacmid using Cellfectin II reagent (Gibco) per the manufacturer’s protocol. Transfected cells were grown at 27 °C for 96 hr. The supernatant media from the cells was harvested, filtered through a 0.2 μm filter, and stored as P1 virus. 100 μL of P1 virus was added to 1 L of Sf9 cells at a cell density of 1×10<sup>6</sup>/mL in serum-free Sf-900 III media. The cells were grown at 96 hr at 27 °C while shaking at 120 rpm. The cells were spun down at 4000×g for 20 min, and the supernatant media was filtered through a 0.2 μm filter and stored as P2 baculovirus. P2 baculovirus was used for large-scale transduction of HEK293S GnTI<sup>-</sup> cells. Large-scale expression of HGSNAT was done by baculoviral transduction of HEK293S GnTI<sup>-</sup> cells suspended in FreeStyle 293 expression media containing 2% FBS. Mammalian cell culture at a density of 3×10<sup>6</sup> cells/mL was transduced using P2 baculovirus at a multiplicity of infection of 1.5–2 and was incubated on an orbital shaker at 37 °C and 5% CO<sub>2</sub> for 8–10 hr. The cells were supplemented with 10 mM sodium butyrate and were then incubated in a shaker at 32 °C and 5% CO<sub>2</sub> for an additional 38–40 hr.

Briefly, 100,000 transfected cells were solubilized in 500 μl of 1% detergent, 25 mM Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, 200 mM NaCl, 1 mM PMSF, 0.8 μM aprotinin, 2 μg/mL leupeptin, and 2 μM pepstatin A at 4 °C for 1 hr on an end-end rotator. After solubilization, the lysate was centrifuged at 185,000×g for 1 hr at 4 °C. The supernatant was filtered through 0.45 μm filter, and 100 μl filtrate was analyzed on a Superose 6 Increase 10/300 GL column (Cytiva Life Sciences) pre-equilibrated with 0.15 mM LMNG, 25 mM Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, and 200 mM NaCl. GFP fluorescence in the eluate was monitored by a fluorometer (Shimadzu scientific instruments) set at Ex/Em of 485/510 nm. To test the stability of HGSNAT in various conditions, the solubilized samples were heated at 55 °C for 15 min, centrifuged at 10,000 rpm for 10 min, filtered through 0.45 μm filter, and were analyzed again on a Superose 6 Increase 10/300 GL column. To measure the overall relative expression of mutants, 100,000 cells expressing the mutants were solubilized in 100 ul of 1% digitonin, 25 mM Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, 200 mM NaCl, 1 mM PMSF, 0.8 μM aprotinin, 2 μg/mL leupeptin, and 2 μM pepstatin A at 4 °C for 1 hr on an end-end rotator. The solubilized lysates were transferred to Costar 96-well flat bottom clear plates without centrifugation, and GFP fluorescence was monitored at Ex/Em of 480/520 nm in SpectroMax M5 (Molecular Devices) microplate reader. For FSEC analysis, mutants were solubilized in 1% digitonin, but were also centrifuged and filtered before being analyzed on Superose 6 Increase 10/300 GL column. Thermal stability of the mutants was tested by heating solubilized lysates of the mutants and WT HGSNAT at 65 °C for 15 min and analyzing them by FSEC.</p></sec><sec id="s4-4"><title>Purification of HGSNAT</title><p>Cell debris from the sonicated lysate of HEK293S GnTI<sup>-</sup> cells expressing N-terminal GFP fusion of HGSNAT was removed by centrifugation at 2400×g for 10 min. The supernatant from the low-speed centrifugation step was subjected to ultra-centrifugation at 185,000×g for 1 hr at 4 °C to harvest membranes. Membranes were resuspended using a dounce homogenizer in suspension buffer (25 mM Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, 200 mM NaCl, 1 mM PMSF, 0.8 μM aprotinin, 2 μg/mL leupeptin, and 2 μM pepstatin A). To this membrane suspension, an equal volume of 2% digitonin solution prepared in membrane suspension buffer was added. The membrane suspension was solubilized for 90 min. at 4 °C. The solubilized membrane suspension was centrifuged at 185,000×g for 1 hr at 4 °C. The solubilized supernatant was passed through the Strep-Tactin affinity resin (IBA Life Sciences) column at a flow rate of ~0.3–0.5 ml/min. Affinity resin saturated with HGSNAT was washed with 5–6 column volumes of 0.5% digitonin, 25 mM Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, and 200 mM NaCl. The bound protein was eluted using 5 mM D-desthiobiotin prepared in the wash buffer. The purity and homogeneity of purified HGSNAT was confirmed by performing FSEC and SDS-PAGE. The amino acid sequence of purified HGSNAT was verified by peptide mass fingerprinting of the bands on SDS-PAGE. For FSEC experiments, ~10 μL of elution fractions were loaded onto a Superose 6 Increase 10/300 GL column pre-equilibrated with 0.15 mM LMNG, 25 mM Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, and 200 mM NaCl. The elution fractions containing homogeneous and pure protein were pooled and concentrated to 2 mg/mL. The concentrated protein was further purified by size-exclusion chromatography (SEC) using Superose 6 Increase 10/300 GL column pre-equilibrated with 0.5% digitonin, 25 mM Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, and 200 mM NaCl. HGSNAT corresponding to the dimeric peak from the SEC step was pooled and concentrated to 0.9 mg/mL for cryo-EM sample preparation.</p></sec><sec id="s4-5"><title>LC-MS analysis of purified HGSNAT</title><p>To identify the endogenously bound acetyl-CoA in recombinant HGSNAT, the purified protein was loaded onto a Chromolith RP-18 end-capped column (4.6 mm X 100 mm; Supleco) operated at 1 ml/min flow rate and 40 °C. Acetyl-CoA was eluted by a gradient of mobile phase A (5 mM ammonium formate) and mobile phase B (10–90% acetonitrile). The eluted samples were analyzed by a Thermo TSQ-Quantis (Thermo Scientific) in positive mode at 5.5kV capillary voltage while scanning at 1000 Da/s from 200 to 1000 m/z in single reaction monitoring (SRM) mode. The data was analyzed using Thermo FreeStyle 1.6 (Thermo Scientific), using an SRM filtering for acetyl-CoA precursor (810.1 m/z) and product (303.1 m/z). To monitor the specific endogenous binding of acetyl-CoA to HGSNAT, we also purified apo HGSNAT from the membrane suspension dialyzed in membrane suspension buffer for 4 days at 4 °C. Apo HGSNAT was processed for LC-MS analysis in the same fashion as the HGSNAT-ACO complex.</p></sec><sec id="s4-6"><title>Cryo-EM sample preparation and data collection</title><p>UltrAuFoil holey-gold 300 mesh 1.2/1.3 μm size/hole space grids (UltrAuFoil, Quantifoil) were glow discharged, using a PELCO glow discharger, for 1 min at 15 mA current and 0.26 mBar air pressure and were immediately used for sample vitrification. 2.5 μL of HGSNAT at 0.9 mg/ml was applied to the glow-discharged grids, and subsequently blotted for 2 s at 18 °C and 100% humidity using a Vitrobot (mark IV, Thermo Fisher Scientific). Without any wait time, the grids were plunge-frozen in liquid ethane. Movies were recorded on a Gatan K3 direct electron detector in super-resolution counting mode with a binned pixel size of 0.85 Å per pixel using Serial EM on a FEI Titan Krios G4i transmission electron microscope operating at an electron beam energy of 300 KeV with a Gatan Image Filter slit width set to 20 eV.

A total of 15,067 micrographs were collected, of which 10,394 were selected for further processing based on the CTF fit. Both blob picking and template picking were used to pick particles, and duplicates were removed. Particles were extracted initially using a box size of 288 pixels. A subset of the particles picked by the blob picker was used to generate a low-resolution <italic>ab initio</italic> reconstruction, which was later used as a reference for iterative 3D classification and heterogenous refinement. The pooled particles were subjected to multiple rounds of reference-free 2D classification and heterogenous refinement to get a cleaned subset of particles which resulted in classes with recognizable features. The cleaned particles were re-extracted with a box size of 360 pixels, and a stack of 94,875 good particles was selected and subjected to an initial round of NU refinement using an <italic>ab initio</italic> model as a reference (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib53">Punjani et al., 2020</xref>). 86,500 particles resulted in a 3.89 Å map, which had well-resolved luminal domain architecture, and visible secondary structure features of TM helices. To improve the resolution further, only the particles belonging to micrographs with CTF fit &lt;4 Å were selected for subsequent refinements. Both C1 and C2 symmetry-imposed maps overlapped well, and we used C2 symmetry in the final rounds of processing (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s2">Figure 1—figure supplements 2</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s3">3</xref>). A final subset of 57,739 particles was used for NU-refinement, yielding a 3.26  Å map (Fourier shell coefficient (FSC) = 0.143 criterion). Symmetry expansion and local refinement with a focused mask on the LD and TMD domains was performed to improve local density in these domains. The map obtained by symmetry expansion was only used to assess the fit of the model to density. A composite map generated by combining these local maps was used to finalize the fit of the side chains during model building and refinement (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s3">Figure 1—figure supplement 3D</xref>).

Through careful structural analysis, the authors propose potential reasons why certain human mutations lead to lysosomal storage disorders and outline a catalytic mechanism. The structural data are of good quality, and the manuscript is clearly written. This study represents an important step toward understanding the mechanism of HGSNAT and is valuable to the field. I have the following suggestions:</p><p>(1) The authors should characterize whether the purified protein is active. Otherwise, how does one know if the detergent used maintains the protein in a biologically relevant state? The authors should at least attempt to do so. If these prove to be challenging, at the very least, the authors should try a cell-based assay to demonstrate that the GFP tag does not interfere with the function.</p><p>(2) In Figure 5, the authors present a detailed schematic of the catalytic cycle, which I find to be too speculative. There is no evidence to suggest that this enzyme undergoes isomerization, similar to a transporter, between open-to-lumen and open-to-cytosol states. Could it not simply involve some movements of side chains to complete the acetyl transfer?</p></body></sub-article><sub-article article-type="referee-report" id="sa2"><front-stub><article-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.93510.3.sa2</article-id><title-group><article-title>Reviewer #2 (Public review):</article-title></title-group><contrib-group><contrib contrib-type="author"><anonymous/><role specific-use="referee">Reviewer</role></contrib></contrib-group></front-stub><body><p>Summary:</p><p>This work describes the structure of Heparan-alpha-glucosaminide N-acetyltransferase (HGSNAT), a lysosomal membrane protein that catalyzes the acetylation reaction of the terminal alpha-D-glucosamine group required for degradation of heparan sulfate (HS). HS degradation takes place during the degradation of the extracellular matrix, a process required for restructuring tissue architecture, regulation of cellular function and differentiation. During this process, HS is degraded into monosaccharides and free sulfate in lysosomes.</p><p>HGSNAT catalyzes the transfer of the acetyl group from acetyl-CoA to the terminal non-reducing amino group of alpha-D-glucosamine. The molecular mechanism by which this process occur has not been described so far. One of the main reasons to study the mechanism of HGSNAT is that multiple mutations spanning the entire sequence of the protein, such as, nonsense mutations, splice-site variants, and missense mutations lead to dysfunction that causes abnormal accumulation of HS within the lysosomes. This accumulation is a cause of mucopolysaccharidosis IIIC (MPS IIIC), an autosomal recessive neurodegenerative lysosomal storage disorder, for which there are no approved drugs or treatment strategies.</p><p>This paper provides a 3.26A structure of HGSNAT, determined by single-particle cryo-EM. The structure reveals that HGSNAT is a dimer in detergent micelles, and a density assigned to acetyl-CoA. The authors speculate about the molecular mechanism of the acetylation reaction, map the mutations known to cause MPS IIIC on the structure and speculate about the nature of the HGSNAT disfunction caused by such mutations.</p><p>Strengths:</p><p>The paper describes a structure of HGSNAT a member of the transmembrane acyl transferase (TmAT) superfamily. The high-resolution of a HGSNAT bound to acetyl-CoA is important for our understanding of HGSNAT mechanism. The density map is of high-quality, except for the luminal domain. The location of the acetyl-CoA allows speculation about the mechanistic role of multiple residues surrounding this molecule.

Through careful structural analysis, the authors propose potential reasons why certain human mutations lead to lysosomal storage disorders and outline a catalytic mechanism. The structural data are of good quality, and the manuscript is clearly written. This study represents an important step toward understanding the mechanism of HGSNAT and is valuable to the field. I have the following suggestions:</p><p>(1) The authors should characterize whether the purified protein is active. Otherwise, how does one know if the detergent used maintains the protein in a biologically relevant state? The authors should at least attempt to do so. If these prove to be challenging, at the very least, the authors should try a cell-based assay to demonstrate that the GFP tag does not interfere with the function.</p></disp-quote><p>We have addressed these concerns in the revised version and mentioned these efforts in our previous response letter. We’re briefly mentioning them here again. We attempted measuring HGSNAT catalyzed reaction by monitoring the decrease in acetyl-CoA in the presence of D-glucosamine (acetyl group acceptor) using a coupled enzyme acetyl-CoA assay kit from SIGMA (MAK039) that converts acetyl-CoA to a fluorescent product measurable at Ex/Em of 535/587 nm. We noticed a decrease in the level of acetyl-CoA (gray) upon the addition of HGSNAT (red) (Rebuttal figure 1).</p><fig id="sa4fig1" position="float"><label>Author response image 1.</label><caption><title>Acetyl-CoA levels in absence and presence of HGSNAT purified in digitonin.</title><p>Decrease in the levels of 10 M acetyl-CoA was measured in presence of 10 M D-glucosamine and 30 nM HGSNAT at pH 7.5.</p></caption><graphic mimetype="image" mime-subtype="tiff" xlink:href="elife-93510-sa4-fig1-v1.tif"/></fig><p>While optimizing the assay, Xu et al. (2024, Nat Struct Mol Biol) published structural and biochemical characterization of HGSNAT, showing that detergent-purified HGSNAT is active. In addition, we have shown by cryo-EM that GFP-tagged HGSNAT that we purified in detergent was already bound to the endogenous substrate ACO, an observation that has been observed by Xu et al., as well. Finally, we performed LC-MS on GFP-tagged HGSNAT purified in detergent to detect bound ACO, which could be further removed by dialysis. These results have been included in Figure S9. The endogenous binding of ACO to HGSNAT in detergent suggests that neither the tag nor detergent are detrimental to the function.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>(2) In Figure 5, the authors present a detailed schematic of the catalytic cycle, which I find to be too speculative. There is no evidence to suggest that this enzyme undergoes isomerization, similar to a transporter, between open-to-lumen and open-to-cytosol states. Could it not simply involve some movements of side chains to complete the acetyl transfer?</p></disp-quote><p>We have already changed this figure in our latest submission. Perhaps the changes made were not obvious while reviewing. We agreed with this reviewer that the enzyme could likely achieve catalysis by simple side chain movements without undergoing extensive isomerization steps, as depicted in Figure 5. In the absence of data supporting large movements during the acetyl transfer reaction, old Figure 5 appeared speculative. Hence, we have edited Figure 5 in the revised version of the manuscript based on the observations we made in this study, and different states shown in the figure do not show any conformational changes and only depict acetyl transfer.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p><bold>Reviewer #2 (Public Review):</bold></p><p>Summary:</p><p>This work describes the structure of Heparan-alpha-glucosaminide N-acetyltransferase (HGSNAT), a lysosomal membrane protein that catalyzes the acetylation reaction of the terminal alpha-D-glucosamine group required for degradation of heparan sulfate (HS). HS degradation takes place during the degradation of the extracellular matrix, a process required for restructuring tissue architecture, regulation of cellular function and differentiation. During this process, HS is degraded into monosaccharides and free sulfate in lysosomes.</p><p>HGSNAT catalyzes the transfer of the acetyl group from acetyl-CoA to the terminal non-reducing amino group of alpha-D-glucosamine. The molecular mechanism by which this process occur has not been described so far. One of the main reasons to study the mechanism of HGSNAT is that multiple mutations spanning the entire sequence of the protein, such as, nonsense mutations, splice-site variants, and missense mutations lead to dysfunction that causes abnormal accumulation of HS within the lysosomes. This accumulation is a cause of mucopolysaccharidosis IIIC (MPS IIIC), an autosomal recessive neurodegenerative lysosomal storage disorder, for which there are no approved drugs or treatment strategies.</p><p>This paper provides a 3.26A structure of HGSNAT, determined by single-particle cryo-EM. The structure reveals that HGSNAT is a dimer in detergent micelles, and a density assigned to acetyl-CoA. The authors speculate about the molecular mechanism of the acetylation reaction, map the mutations known to cause MPS IIIC on the structure and speculate about the nature of the HGSNAT disfunction caused by such mutations.</p><p>Strengths:</p><p>The paper describes a structure of HGSNAT a member of the transmembrane acyl transferase (TmAT) superfamily.

Nevertheless, we have made the changes suggested by this reviewer to structure in the previous round and have released the new coordinates (PDB ID: 8TU9).</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Is there any evidence for the interprotomer disulfide except for the map? e.g. if it is a disulfide-linked dimer, one should see a shift in mobility on non-reducing vs reducing SDS-PAGE. Without this, the evidence from the map is not conclusive - while the symmetry-related cysteines are nearby to one another, based on the map I could argue that they could just as well be modeled with the cys sidechains reduced and pointing away from one another.</p></disp-quote><p>In addition to building the density based on cryo-EM maps, we have performed FSEC-based thermal melt analysis of the Ala mutation of C334 that is involved in disulfide at the dimer interface. C334A is still expressed as a dimer, suggesting that C334A is not the only residue stabilizing the dimer. Upon heating the detergent-solubilized protein, we noticed that the FSEC peak for C334A shows a monomeric HGSNAT (Figure 4-Figure supplement 1 in main manuscript). We hypothesize that in the absence of C334 disulfide, the extensive hydrophobic side-chain interaction network displayed in Figure 2C is responsible for maintaining the integrity of the dimer. Heating disturbs these non-disulfide interactions, thereby rendering the protein monomer. We have also performed PAGE analysis as suggested by this reviewer and noticed that reducing conditions result in a monomeric protein band (Rebuttal figure 2). While we were revising this manuscript, two other groups published structures of HGSNAT (Xu et al., 2024, Nat. Struct Mol Biol, and Zhao et al., 2024, Nat. Comm). These groups have also identified this disulfide at the dimer interface in their HGSNAT structures. Zhao et al. showed that this disulfide is not crucial for dimerization and also suggested that it can break depending on the conformation of HGSNAT. Our FSEC results agree with this observation.</p><fig id="sa4fig2" position="float"><label>Author response image 2.</label><caption><title>Comparison of purified HGSNAT on native and reducing SDS-PAGE.</title><p>The arrows on both the gels indicate N-GFP-HGSNAT.

If these prove to be challenging, at the very least, the authors should try a cell-based assay to demonstrate that the GFP tag does not interfere with the function. The authors would need to establish an in vitro assay using purified protein and assess the level of Acetyl-CoA in the reaction (there are commercial kits and a long list of literature showing how to measure this). They could also follow the HS acetylation reaction by e.g. HPLC-MS or NMR (among other methods).</p></disp-quote><p>The cryo-EM sample was prepared without the exogenous addition of ligand, as noted in the manuscript. However, we see that acetyl-CoA was intrinsically bound to the protein, indicating the ability of GFP-tagged HGSNAT protein to bind the ligand. Upon dialysis, we see release of acetyl-CoA from the protein, which we have confirmed by LC-MS analysis (Fig S9). We purified the protein at a pH optimal for acetyl-CoA binding, as suggested by Bame, K. J. and Rome, L. H. (1985) and Meikle, P. J. et al., (1995). Because we see acetyl-CoA in a structure obtained using a GFP fusion, we argue that GFP does not interfere with protein stability and ability to bind to the co-substrate. As demonstrated by existing literature HGSNAT catalyzed reaction is compartmentalized spatially and conditionally. The binding of acetyl-CoA happens towards the cytosol and is optimal at pH 7-0.8.0, while the transfer of the acetyl group to heparan sulfate occurs towards the luminal side and is optimal at pH 5.0-6.0. We attempted measuring HGSNAT catalyzed reaction by monitoring decrease in acetyl-CoA in presence of D-glucosamine (acetyl group acceptor) using a coupled enzyme acetyl-CoA assay kit from SIGMA (MAK039) that converts acetyl-CoA to a fluorescent product measurable at Ex/Em of 535/587 nm. We noticed a decrease in the level of acetyl-CoA in the presence of HGSNAT-ACO complex (blue) and apo HGSNAT (red); the difference compared to the ACO standard (gray) was not significant. While optimizing the assay, Xu et al. (2024, Nat Struct Mol Biol) published structural and biochemical characterization of HGSNAT, showing that detergent-purified HGSNAT is active.</p><fig id="sa4fig3" position="float"><label>Author response image 3.</label><caption><title>Acetyl-CoA levels in absence and presence of HGSNAT purified in digitonin.</title><p>Decrease in the levels of 10 mM acetyl-CoA was measured in presence of 10 mM D-glucosamine and 30 nM HGSNAT at pH 7.5.</p></caption><graphic mimetype="image" mime-subtype="tiff" xlink:href="elife-93510-sa4-fig3-v1.tif"/></fig><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>(2) In Figure 5, the authors present a detailed schematic of the catalytic cycle, which I find to be too speculative. There is no evidence to suggest that this enzyme undergoes isomerization, similar to a transporter, between open-to-lumen and open-to-cytosol states. Could it not simply involve some movements of side chains to complete the acetyl transfer? The speculative nature of this assumption needs to be clearly acknowledged throughout the manuscript and discussed in more detail. The authors could use HDX-MS or introduce cysteine residues in the hypothetical inward- and outward-facing cavities and test accessibility by incubating the purified protein with maleimides or other agents reacting with free cysteine.</p></disp-quote><p>We thank the reviewers for this insightful critique. Yes, the enzyme could likely achieve catalysis by simple side chain movements without undergoing extensive isomerization steps, as depicted in Figure 5. We also agree with the reviewer that HDX-MS could be the best way to monitor the substrate-induced conformational dynamics within HGSNAT experimentally. In the absence of data supporting large movements during the acetyl transfer reaction, figure 5 is speculative. We have now edited Figure 5 in the revised version of the manuscript based on the observations we made in this study.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>(3) The acetyl-CoA-bound state is described as the open-to-lumen state. Indeed, from Figure 1C, the lumen opening appears much larger than the cytosol opening. Is there any small tunnel that connects the substrate site to the cytosol? In other words, is this state accessible to both the lumen and the cytosol, albeit with a larger opening toward the lumen? This question arises because, in Figure S5, the tunnel calculated by MOLE seems to also connect to the cytosol.</p></disp-quote><p>Yes, it is likely that the ACOS is accessible via lumen and cytosol to varying degrees, as evidenced by MOLE prediction. However, binding of the bulky nucleoside head group of acetyl-CoA at ACOS blocks the cytosolic entrance in the confirmation discussed in this manuscript. MOLE prediction was performed on a structure devoid of acetyl-CoA, and it is possible that the protein doesn’t essentially undergo isomerization between open-to-lumen and open-to-cytosol confirmations during acetyl transfer. Likely, ACOS is always accessible from both the lumen and cytosol, but depending on the substrates or products bound, the accessibility could be limited to either the lysosomal lumen or cytosol. We have rewritten all the statements mentioning an open-to-lumen confirmation to reflect this argument.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>(4) The authors state, &quot;Interestingly, in most of the detergent conditions we tested, HGSNAT was predominantly dimeric (Fig S1C-H),&quot; and also mention, &quot;In all the detergents we tested, HGSNAT eluted as a dimer, a testament to the extensive side-chain interaction network.&quot; The dimerization is said to be mediated by a disulfide bond. I would be surprised if the detergents the authors tested could break a disulfide bond. Therefore, can this observation truly serve as a testament to an &quot;extensive&quot; side-chain interaction network?</p></disp-quote><p>We agree with the reviewer that detergents are unlikely to break a disulfide bond. To address this comment, we generated a C334A mutant of HGSNAT and extracted it from cells in 1% digitonin. It is still expressed as a dimer (Fig S8E). However, upon heating the detergent solubilized protein, we noticed that the FSEC peak for C334A shows a monomeric HGSNAT (Fig S8I and S8K). We hypothesize that in the absence of C334 disulfide, the extensive hydrophobic side-chain interaction network displayed in Figure 2C is responsible for maintaining the integrity of the dimer. Heating disturbs these non-disulfide interactions, thereby rendering the protein monomer.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>(5) Apart from the cryo-EM structure, the article does not provide any other experimental evidence to support or explain a molecular mechanism. Due to the complete absence of functional assays, mutagenesis analysis, or other structures such as a ternary complex or an acetylated enzyme intermediate, the mechanistic model depicted in Figure 5 should be taken with caution. This uncertainty needs to be clearly described in the manuscript text. Performing additional mutagenesis experiments to test key hypotheses, or further discussing relevant data from the literature, would strengthen the manuscript.</p></disp-quote><p>We agree with the reviewer on the lack of supporting evidence for the mechanistic models proposed in Fig 5. They were made based on previously reported biochemical characterization of HGSNAT by Rome &amp; Crain (1981), Rome et al. (1983), Miekle et al. (1995), and Fan et al. (2011). However, we agree with the reviewer that this schematic is not experimentally proven and is speculative at best. We have edited Figure 5 in the revised version of the manuscript. In addition, we have also performed mutagenesis analysis to study the stability of mutants (Fig S8) and performed LC-MS analysis to identify endogenously bound acetyl-CoA (Fig S9) to strengthen parts of the manuscript. We have discussed our findings in the results and modified the discussion according to these suggestions.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>(6) It is discussed that H269 is an essential residue that participates in the acetylation reaction, possibly becoming acetylated during the process. However, there is no solid experimental evidence, e.g. mutagenesis analysis or structural analysis, in this or previous articles, that demonstrates this to be the case. Providing more information, ideally involving additional experimental work, would strengthen this aspect of the mechanism that is proposed. This would require establishing an in vitro assay, as described in 1.</p></disp-quote><p>H269, as a crucial catalytic residue, was suggested by monitoring the effect of chemical modifications of amino acids on acetylation of HGSNAT membranes by Bame, K. J. and Rome, L. H. (1986). We generated N258I and H269A mutants of HGSNAT and analyzed their stability. We noticed a greater destabilization in N258I compared to H269A (Fig S8). We believe this is because of the loss of ability to bind acetyl-CoA, as the TMs around a catalytic core of the protein in our cryo-EM structure were stabilized by interactions with acetyl-CoA. Recently, Xu et al. (2024, Nat Struct Mol Biol) suggested that they do not observe acetylated histidine in their structure. However, our structure and that reported by Xu et al. (2024) are obtained at cytosolic pH. Perhaps, acetylation of H269 occurs at acidic lysosomal pH. Extensive structural and catalytic investigation of HGSNAT at low pH is required to rule out H269 acetylation as a step in the HGSNAT catalyzed reaction.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>(7) In the discussion part, the authors mention previous studies in which it was postulated that the catalytic reaction can be described by a random order mechanistic model or a Ping Pong Bi Bi model. However, the authors leave open the question of which of these mechanisms best describes the acetylation reaction. The structure presented here does not provide evidence that could support one mechanism or the other. The authors could explore if an in vitro experimental measurement of protein activity would provide any information in this regard.</p></disp-quote><p>We agree with the reviewer that a more detailed kinetic analysis is necessary to define the bisubstrate reaction mechanism of HGSNAT. All the existing structural data on two isoforms of HGSNAT is obtained at basic pH. As a result, the existing structures do not unambiguously demonstrate the bisusbtrate mechanism of HGSNAT. We believe low pH structural characterization and a detailed kinetic and structural characterization of HGSNAT in membrane mimetics like nanodiscs could provide more insights into the mechanism. However, these studies are a future undertaking and are not a part of this manuscript.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>(8) Although the authors map the mutations leading to MPS IIIC on the structure and use FoldX software to predict the impact of these mutations on folding and fold stability, there is no experimental evidence to support FoldX's predictions. It would be ideal if an additional test for these predictions were included in the manuscript. The authors could follow the unfolding of purified mutants by SEC, FSEC, or changes in intrinsic fluorescence to assess protein stability.</p></disp-quote><p>As suggested here, we prepared HGSNAT MPSIIIC variants and tested their expression and stability (please see Fig S8). These results have been included in the revised version of the manuscript.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>(9) Some sidechains that have quite strong sidechain density are missing atoms. I would be particularly careful with omitting sidechains that pack in the hydrophobic core, as this can tend to artificially reduce the clash score. Check F81, L62, P91 and V87, for example.</p></disp-quote><p>We have revisited the modeling of these regions and deposited new coordinates.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>(10) W316 seems to have the wrong rotamer.</p></disp-quote><p>This has been corrected in the new coordinate file that has been released.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>(11) N134 and N433 seem to have extra density.

However, we see evidence for NAG density at N114, N134, and N433. These have now been modeled in the structure.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>(12) At the C-terminal residue (Ile-635), the very C-terminal carboxylate is modeled pointing to a hydrophobic environment.
