To investigate the relation between <italic>Prdm9</italic>-controlled meiotic arrest and asynapsis, we inserted random stretches of consubspecific homology on several autosomal pairs in sterile hybrids, and analyzed their ability to form synaptonemal complexes and to rescue male fertility. Twenty-seven or more megabases of consubspecific (belonging to the same subspecies) homology fully restored synapsis in a given autosomal pair, and we predicted that two or more DSBs within symmetric hotspots per chromosome are necessary for successful meiosis. We hypothesize that impaired recombination between evolutionarily diverged chromosomes could function as one of the mechanisms of hybrid sterility occurring in various sexually reproducing species.</p></abstract><abstract abstract-type="executive-summary"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.34282.002</object-id><title>eLife digest</title><p>It has been known for centuries that hybrids between closely related species are often infertile.

HS is a universal phenomenon observed in many eukaryotic inter-species hybrids, including examples in yeast, plants, insects, birds, and mammals (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Coyne and Orr, 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib40">Maheshwari and Barbash, 2011</xref>). In the early days of genetics, HS was difficult to accommodate in Darwin's theory of evolution by natural selection. In time, however, the Bateson–Dobzhansky–Muller incompatibility (BDMI) hypothesis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib45">Muller and Pontecorvo, 1942</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Dobzhansky, 1951</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib47">Orr, 1996</xref>) explicated HS, and more generally any hybrid incompatibility, as a consequence of the independent divergence of mutually interacting genes resulting in aberrant interaction of the new alleles that have not been tested by natural selection. HS has several common features across various sexually reproducing eukaryotic species. Haldane's rule posits that if one sex of the F<sub>1</sub> offspring of two different animal races is absent, rare, or sterile, it is the heterogametic sex (XY or ZW) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Haldane, 1922</xref>). Another common feature refers to the disproportionately large role of Chr X compared to that of autosomes in reproductive isolation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib52">Presgraves, 2008</xref>). More recently, interaction between selfish genomic elements causing meiotic drive and their suppressors has been implicated in some instances of reproductive isolation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib48">Orr, 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib63">Zhang et al., 2015</xref>).</p><p>The molecular mechanisms underlying HS remain an unresolved question. Historically, genic and chromosomal mechanisms of HS had been hypothesized, but the latter were soon dismissed as unlikely on the grounds that large chromosomal rearrangements do not segregate with HS genetic factors (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Dobzhansky, 1951</xref>). Other possible forms of non-genic chromosomal HS were not considered because of the limited knowledge of the carrier of genetic information at the time. Thus, for the past 80 years or so, the focus on the genic control of HS prevailed (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Dobzhansky, 1951</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib47">Orr, 1996</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Forsdyke, 2017</xref>). In studies mapping HS genes, the <italic>Drosophila</italic> group of species has been the model of choice, yet only five <italic>Drosophila</italic> HS genes, namely <italic>OdsH</italic>, <italic>JYAlpha</italic>, <italic>Ovd</italic>, <italic>agt,</italic> and <italic>Taf1</italic>, have been identified to date, none of which has a known interacting partner predicted by the BDMI hypothesis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib58">Ting et al., 1998</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib41">Masly et al., 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib50">Phadnis and Orr, 2009</xref>). The low success rate of the positional cloning of HS genes was explained by the oligogenic or polygenic nature of HS phenotypes and by the inherent difficulty in genetically dissecting the phenotype that prevents its own transfer to progeny.</p><p>Over 40 years ago, we introduced the house mouse (<italic>Mus musculus</italic>) as a mammalian model for the genetic analysis of HS. The first mouse HS locus <italic>Hst1</italic> was genetically mapped in crosses of laboratory inbred strains (predominantly of <italic>Mus musculus domesticus</italic> (<italic>Mmd</italic>) origin) with wild <italic>Mus musculus musculus</italic> (<italic>Mmm</italic>) mice (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Forejt and Iványi, 1974</xref>). Later, we developed the PWD/Ph and PWK/Ph inbred strains purely from the wild <italic>Mmm</italic> mice of Central Bohemia (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Gregorová and Forejt, 2000</xref>) and used them in the positional cloning of <italic>Hst1</italic> by high-resolution genetic crosses and physical mapping (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Gregorová et al., 1996</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib59">Trachtulec et al., 1997</xref>). Finally, we identified the <italic>Hst1</italic> locus with the PR-domain-containing nine gene (<italic>Prdm9</italic>) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib42">Mihola et al., 2009</xref>), which codes for histone H3 lysine 4/lysine 36 methyltransferase (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib51">Powers et al., 2016</xref>) the first and still the only HS gene known in vertebrates. Most of the tested laboratory inbred strains share either the <italic>Prdm9<sup>Dom2</sup></italic> or the <italic>Prdm9<sup>Dom3</sup></italic> allele (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib49">Parvanov et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Brunschwig et al., 2012</xref>). The former allele was found in inbred strains producing sterile male hybrids when crossed with PWD females, whereas the <italic>Prdm9<sup>Dom3</sup></italic> was observed in the strains that yielded quasi-fertile males in the same type of inter-subspecific crosses (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Forejt et al., 2012</xref>).</p><p>The male sterility of (PWD x C57BL/6)F1 (henceforth PB6F1) hybrids depends on the interaction of the heterozygous allelic combination <italic>Prdm9<sup>Msc</sup>/Prdm9<sup>Dom2</sup></italic> with the PWD allelic form of the X-linked Hybrid sterility X Chromosome 2 locus, <italic>Hstx2<sup>Msc</sup></italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Dzur-Gejdosova et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Bhattacharyya et al., 2014</xref>). For the sake of clarity and to stress the origin of the alleles, we will use the names <italic>Prdm9<sup>PWD</sup></italic>, <italic>Prdm9<sup>B6</sup></italic> and <italic>Hstx2<sup>PWD</sup></italic> in the rest of this paper. Any other tested allelic combination of these two major HS genes yields fully fertile or subfertile male hybrids (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Dzur-Gejdosova et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Flachs et al., 2012</xref>). The proper allelic combination of <italic>Prdm9</italic> and <italic>Hstx2</italic> genes is necessary but not sufficient to govern HS completely because less than 10% instead of the expected 25% of (PWD x B6) x B6 male backcross progeny replicated the infertility of male PB6F1 hybrids (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Dzur-Gejdosova et al., 2012</xref>). Initially, we explained this 'missing heritability' by assuming the genic interaction of three or more additional HS genes with a small effect that had escaped the genetic screen (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Dzur-Gejdosova et al., 2012</xref>). However, an alternative, non-genic explanation emerged from the analysis of meiotic phenotypes of sterile hybrids. We observed multiple unsynapsed autosomal pairs decorated by phosphorylated histone <bold>γ</bold>H2AX as a mark of persisting unrepaired DNA double-strand breaks (DSBs) in approximately 90% of primary spermatocytes of infertile PB6F<sub>1</sub> hybrids. The asynapsis was accompanied by disturbed transcriptional inactivation of sex chromosomes at the first meiotic prophase (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Bhattacharyya et al., 2013</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">, 2014</xref>). The failure of intersubspecific homologs to synapse was clearly dependent on interhomolog interactions, and we suggested that their fast-evolving nongenic DNA divergence could be the causal factor. Because meiotic asynapses of different origin are known to compromise the normal progression of the first meiotic division (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Forejt, 1984</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">, 1996</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">Mahadevaiah et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Burgoyne et al., 2009</xref>), we proposed that <italic>Prdm9</italic> and <italic>Hstx2</italic>-directed asynapsis per se could be the ultimate cause of the sterility of male hybrids. Recently, the role of PRDM9 zinc-finger-domain binding sites within noncoding genomic DNA has been demonstrated in PB6F<sub>1</sub> male HS. Replacement of the mouse sequence encoding the PRDM9 zinc-finger array with the orthologous human sequence reversed sterility in (PWD x B6-<italic>Prdm9<sup>Hu</sup></italic>)F<sub>1</sub> hybrid males (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Davies et al., 2016</xref>). In PB6F<sub>1</sub> hybrids, roughly 70% of the <italic>Prdm9</italic>-directed DSBs hotspots identified by the DMC1 ChIP-seq method were enriched on the 'nonself' homologous chromosome, as the DSB hotspots determined by the B6 allele of <italic>Prdm9</italic> were found predominantly on PWD chromosomes, and vice versa. Such hotspots were designated as asymmetric DSB hotspots. Chromosome-specific quantification of asymmetry correlated well with the asynapsis rate across five arbitrarily chosen chromosomes of PB6F<sub>1</sub> hybrids (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Davies et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib56">Smagulova et al., 2016</xref>). Another, non-exclusive interpretation of DMC1 ChIP-seq data pointed to significant enrichment of PRDM9-independent hotspots in the PB6F<sub>1</sub> hybrid testis, which occurs in promoters and other regulatory motifs and which is characteristic of spermatogenic arrest in <italic>Prdm9</italic> knockout males (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib56">Smagulova et al., 2016</xref>). Recently, one third of PRDM9-dependent DSBs were reported within sequences that have at least some repetitive character, indicating that inappropriately high DSB levels in transposons and other repetitive elements may contribute to the infertility seen in some mouse hybrids (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib62">Yamada et al., 2017</xref>).</p><p>In this work, we studied the relationship between meiotic chromosome asynapsis, intersubspecific heterozygosity and male HS in a series of PB6F<sub>1</sub> hybrids carrying recombinant chromosomes with <italic>Mmm/Mmm</italic> consubpecific (belonging to the same subspecies) PWD/PWD homozygous intervals on <italic>Mmm/Mmd</italic> intersubpecific (belonging to different subspecies) PWD/B6 heterozygous background. We report the restoration of synapsis of intersubspecific chromosome pairs in the presence of 27 Mb or more of consubspecific sequence, and the reversal of HS by targeted suppression of asynapsis in the four most asynapsis-sensitive chromosomes. Our findings point to the chromosomal basis of <italic>Prdm9</italic>-directed hybrid male infertility as a (nonexclusive) alternative to a widely accepted concept of hybrid sterility driven by multiple genic incompatibilities.</p></sec><sec id="s2" sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><sec id="s2-1"><title>Small chromosomes are more susceptible to asynapsis in sterile F<sub>1</sub> hybrids</title><p>First, we ascertained the frequency of meiotic asynapsis separately for each chromosome pair of PB6F1 hybrid males by combining the use of fluorescence in-situ hybridization (FISH) to decorate chromatin from individual chromosomes with immunostaining of synaptonemal complex protein 3 (SYCP3) (a major component of axial/lateral elements), to visualize synaptonemal complexes, and HORMA domain-containing protein-2 (HORMAD2) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib61">Wojtasz et al., 2012</xref>), to identify the axial elements of unsynapsed chromosomes (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1A</xref>). Altogether, 4168 pachynemas from 40 PB6F1 hybrid males were analyzed. All autosomes of hybrid males displayed a certain degree of asynapsis, classified as complete, partial, or intermingled (more than two tangled univalents within labeled chromatin cloud), with frequencies ranging from 2.6% (Chr 1) to 42.2% (Chr 19) (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="fig2sdata1">Figure 2—source data 1</xref>). A strong bias was evident towards higher asynapsis rates in the five smallest autosomes (p=5.2×10<sup>−14</sup>, comparison of Generalized Linear Mixed Models [GLMM], <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2A</xref>). Recently, SPO11 oligos released during the processing of DSBs were sequenced, mapped and quantified at chromosome-wide scale in male mice of the B6 laboratory inbred strain (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Lange et al., 2016</xref>). This information, together with the estimated frequency of asymmetric DSB hotspots in PB6F1 hybrids (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Davies et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib56">Smagulova et al., 2016</xref>), enabled us to calculate the possible correlation between the number of DSBs within symmetric hotspots (hereafter symmetric DSBs) per chromosome per cell and synapsis between intersubspecific homologs. The calculation is based on and limited by the following premises: (i) the overall densities of DSBs on individual chromosomes of B6 and PB6F1 hybrid males are similar; (ii) approximately 250 DSBs occur per leptotene/zygotene cell (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">Kauppi et al., 2013</xref>); and (iii) the 0.28 proportion of symmetric DSB hotspots in (PWD x B6)F<sub>1</sub> hybrid males (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Davies et al., 2016</xref>) is constant in all autosomes. Under these conditions, a strong negative correlation (Spearman’s ρ=−0.760, p=0.0003) of asynapsis rate with predicted symmetric DSBs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Lange et al., 2016</xref>) can be seen (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="fig2sdata2">Figure 2—source data 2</xref>). This correlation is stronger than the correlation of the asynapsis rate with the chromosomal physical length (Spearman’s ρ=−0.681, p=0.0013). Even though the chromosomal length and the expected number of symmetric DSB hotspots strongly correlate (Spearman’s ρ=0.916, p=1.1 × 10<sup>−7</sup>), we observed that it is the symmetric DSB hotspots that affect the asynapsis rate. The chromosomal length does not add any additional explanation of the asynapsis rate to that provided by symmetric DSBs (p=0.709, comparison of GLMM models). On the contrary, the symmetric DSBs add an additional explanation of the asynapsis rate to that provided by the chromosomal length (p=0.046, comparison of GLMM models).

This asymmetry could be explained in part by erosion of the PRDM9-binding sites due to preferential transmission to progeny of the altered hotspots motifs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Boulton et al., 1997</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib46">Myers et al., 2010</xref>). In a parallel study, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib56">Smagulova et al.

To test this prediction experimentally, we constructed pairs of PWD/B6 intersubspecific homologs carrying stretches of PWD/PWD consubspecific intervals, which by definition cannot carry asymmetric hotspots. We found that chromosomes with 27 Mb or longer stretches of consubspecific sequence always rescued full synapsis in hybrid males. The position of the consubspecific interval along the chromosome was not critical for synapsis rescue, in accordance with the finding that synaptonemal complexes nucleate at multiple recombination sites in each chromosome (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib64">Zickler and Kleckner, 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Finsterbusch et al., 2016</xref>). We assume that the presence of symmetric DSB in the PWD/PWD homozygous stretches exceeded the threshold of a minimum number of timely repaired DSBs, thus rescuing normal meiotic synapsis.</p><p>Allowing for the assumptions enumerated in the 'Results' section, the number of DSBs necessary for proper synapsis of a given chromosome can be estimated on the basis of the expected distribution of symmetric DSB hotspots on all autosomes and their asynapsis ratios in sterile F<sub>1</sub> hybrids (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="fig2sdata2">Figure 2—source data 2</xref>). We aimed to model how the induction and repair of DSBs influence proper meiotic synapsis, and tried to estimate the minimum number of symmetric DSBs per chromosome sufficient for full meiotic synapsis. Our model predicts that in approximately 25% of cases, a chromosome is asynapsed because there are only asymmetric DSBs and no symmetric DSBs (slope of the regression of P[asynapsis] on P[0 symmetric DSBs]=4.22). Assuming a critical threshold of the required DSBs, the remaining 75% of asynapsis could occur on chromosomes with one symmetric DSB and with the other DSBs being asymmetric. Thus, it is consistent with our data that two symmetric DSBs per chromosome could be sufficient for full development of the synaptonemal complex, as shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6</xref> (slope of the regression of P[asynapsis] on P[0 or one symmetric DSBs]=1.00).

Likewise, our early studies considered univalents in PB6F1 primary spermatocytes as a secondary consequence of meiotic arrest caused by genic incompatibilities (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Forejt and Iványi, 1974</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Forejt, 1996</xref>). However, quantitative meiotic analyses revealed that 90% of primary spermatocytes carry one or more pairs of asynapsed homologs and, more importantly, that asynapsis is chromosome-autonomous, depending on inter-homolog (<italic>cis</italic>-) interactions (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Bhattacharyya et al., 2013</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">, 2014</xref>). The findings described in this paper provide the first direct link between <italic>Prdm9</italic>-controlled asynapsis and meiotic arrest in PB6F<sub>1</sub> male hybrids. We showed that by deliberately manipulating the synapsis of homologous chromosomes, we could modify the extent of meiotic arrest in intersubspecific PB6F<sub>1</sub> hybrids in a predictable way.</p><p>Admittedly, the exact molecular basis of meiotic asynapsis and subsequent spermatogenic arrest in PB6F<sub>1</sub> males is still unclear and the lack of symmetric DSBs is not necessarily the only explanation for the sterility of thePB6F<sub>1</sub>hybrid. For instance, multimerization of PRDM9 mediated by PRDM9's zinc fingers (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Baker et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Altemose et al., 2017</xref>) could alter its DNA-binding properties and enable the default PRDM9-independent hotspots (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib56">Smagulova et al., 2016</xref>) to appear and to generate the <italic>Prdm9</italic> null-like phenotype (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Hayashi et al., 2005</xref>). Recent identification of DSB hotspots within repetitive sequences (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib62">Yamada et al., 2017</xref>) indicate another potential threat to homologous synapsis in intersubspecific hybrids, which could be caused by illegitimate interactions with nonhomologous chromosomes or by the absence of an allelic PRDM9 binding site in the genome of the other subspecies.</p><p>Models of the molecular mechanism of hybrid sterility will need to take into consideration that all intersubspecific pairs of homologs synapse properly in the majority of pachynemas. A particular chromosome fails to synapse in as few as 2% and maximally in 45% of PB6F1 pachynemas. Oddly, the B6 allele of the X-linked <italic>Hstx2</italic> locus dramatically increases the pairing efficiency but causes only a small change, if any alteration, in the profile of asymmetric hotspots (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Davies et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib56">Smagulova et al., 2016</xref>).</p><p>The asymmetric DSBs could affect meiotic pairing by hindering repair when searching for the allelic site of a homologous chromosome as a template. The homologous sequence may be inaccessible because of its inappropriate chromatin conformation, such as lack of trimethylation of Lysine four and Lysine 36 of histone H3 or because a critical alteration of the PRDM9-binding motif may provoke the antirecombination activity of the mismatch repair machinery (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Chakraborty and Alani, 2016</xref>) to prevent the repair. It is also probable that some 'difficult' DSBs could be repaired using sister chromatid as a DNA template during the delayed phase of repair when the nonhomologous compensatory synapsis can occur and when the non PAR X chromosome DSBs are most probably repaired (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">Kauppi et al., 2013</xref>). However, such inter-sister recombination cannot contribute to the homolog's synapsis.</p><p>Hybrid sterility, as well as pairing of homologous chromosomes and meiotic recombination, are universal biological phenomena common to the majority of sexually reproducing organisms. We hypothesize that meiotic pairing and hybrid sterility controlled by <italic>Prdm9</italic> could represent a special case of a more universal reproductive isolation mechanism that is based on meiotic recombination. It is tempting to speculate that the mechanisms that safeguard recombination between homologous allelic sequences could function as checkpoints that disable recombination after homologous sequences have diverged sufficiently during the isolation of closely related taxa. Originally, such an inter-species barrier was proposed by Radman and colleagues (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib54">Rayssiguier et al., 1989</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib57">Stambuk and Radman, 1998</xref>) to prevent homeologous recombination between <italic>Escherichia coli</italic> and <italic>Salmonella typhiimurium</italic>.

An exciting possibility, which is experimentally testable, posits an antirecombination machinery as a means to gradually restrict gene flow between related taxa, a 'cause in fact' of speciation.</p></sec></sec><sec id="s4" sec-type="materials|methods"><title>Materials and methods</title><table-wrap id="keyresource" position="anchor"><label>Key resources table</label><table frame="hsides" rules="groups"><thead><tr><th>Reagent type (species) <break/>or resource</th><th>Designation</th><th>Source or reference</th><th>Identifiers</th><th>Additional information</th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td valign="bottom">Antibody - primary</td><td valign="bottom">Anti SYCP3 (mouse monoclonal, clone D-1)</td><td>Santa Cruz Biotechnology</td><td>sc-74569; SCP-3 Antibody (D-1); RRID:<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://scicrunch.org/resolver/AB_2197353">AB_2197353</ext-link></td><td>(1:50)</td></tr><tr><td valign="bottom">Antibody - primary</td><td valign="bottom">Anti gH2AFX (rabbit polyclonal)</td><td valign="bottom">Abcam</td><td valign="bottom">ab2893; gH2AFX antibody; RRID:<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://scicrunch.org/resolver/AB_303388">AB_303388</ext-link></td><td>(1:1000)</td></tr><tr><td valign="bottom">Antibody - primary</td><td valign="bottom">Anti HORMAD2 (rabbit polyclonal)</td><td valign="bottom">DOI: 10.1371/journal.pgen.1000702</td><td valign="bottom">Gift from Dr. Attila Toth</td><td>(1:700)</td></tr><tr><td valign="bottom">Antibody - primary</td><td valign="bottom">Anti HORMAD2 (rabbit polyclonal)</td><td>Santa Cruz Biotechnology</td><td>sc-82192; HORMAD2 antibody (C-18); RRID:<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://scicrunch.org/resolver/AB_2121124">AB_2121124</ext-link></td><td>(1:500)</td></tr><tr><td valign="bottom">Antibody - secondary</td><td valign="bottom">Anti-Rabbit IgG - AlexaFluor568 (goat polyclonal)</td><td>Molecular Probes</td><td>A-11036; RRID:<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://scicrunch.org/resolver/AB_10563566">AB_10563566</ext-link></td><td>(1:500)</td></tr><tr><td valign="bottom">Antibody - secondary</td><td valign="bottom">Anti-Mouse IgG - AlexaFluor647 (goat polyclonal)</td><td>Molecular Probes</td><td>A-21235; RRID:<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://scicrunch.org/resolver/AB_2535804">AB_2535804</ext-link></td><td>(1:500)</td></tr><tr><td valign="bottom">Blocking reagent forimmunostaining</td><td valign="bottom">Normal goat serum from healthy animals</td><td valign="bottom">Chemicon</td><td valign="bottom">S26-100ML</td><td valign="bottom"/></tr><tr><td valign="bottom">Protease inhibitors</td><td valign="bottom">Complete, Mini, EDTA-free Protease Inhibitor Cocktail</td><td valign="bottom">Roche</td><td>4693159001</td><td/></tr><tr><td valign="bottom">Paraformaldehyde</td><td valign="bottom">Paraformaldehyde AQ solution</td><td valign="bottom">Electron Microscopy Sciences</td><td>15714S</td><td/></tr><tr><td valign="bottom">DNA-FISH probes for mouse chromosomes1–19</td><td valign="bottom">XMP X Green - Mouse chromosome paints</td><td>MetaSystems</td><td>D-1401–050-FI; D-1420–050-FI</td><td valign="bottom"/></tr><tr><td>RNA FISH</td><td>Mouse Cot-1 DNA</td><td valign="bottom">Invitrogen</td><td>18440016</td><td/></tr><tr><td>RNA FISH</td><td valign="bottom">Biotin nick translation kit</td><td>Roche</td><td valign="bottom">11,745,824,910</td><td/></tr><tr><td>RNA FISH</td><td valign="bottom">Biotinylated goat anti-avidin antibody</td><td valign="bottom">Vector Laboratories</td><td>BA-0300; RRID:<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://scicrunch.org/resolver/AB_2336108">AB_2336108</ext-link></td><td>(1:100)</td></tr><tr><td>RNA FISH</td><td valign="bottom">Fluorescein-Avidin-DCS</td><td valign="bottom">Vector Laboratories</td><td>A-2011; RRID:<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://scicrunch.org/resolver/AB_2336456">AB_2336456</ext-link></td><td>(1:100)</td></tr><tr><td valign="bottom">RNase inhibitor</td><td valign="bottom">Ribonucleoside-vanadyl complex (RVC)</td><td valign="bottom">SIGMA - ALDRICH</td><td valign="bottom">94742</td><td valign="bottom">(1:100 = 2 mM)</td></tr></tbody></table></table-wrap><sec id="s4-1"><title>Mice, ethics statement and genotyping</title><p>The mice were maintained at the Institute of Molecular Genetics in Prague and Vestec, Czech Republic.

The total number of symmetric DSBs in the autosome was taken as the sum of symmetric DSBs in the respective parts. Steps (i) to (iv) were performed in N = 100000 simulations to obtain a probabilistic distribution (Source Code 1).</p><p>The effects of the number of Spo11 oligos and the chromosomal length on the asynapsis rate were investigated using a GLMM model. In all of the GLMM models used in this work, the asynapsis was modeled as a binary response to the fixed effects under investigation and a random intercept for each animal. In F<sub>1</sub> hybrids, 95% confidence intervals for the the observed rates of asynapsed pachynemas and for the expected rated of asynapsed pachynemas were calculated by bootstrap. The estimates of mean asynapsis rate in respective chromosomes, their standard errors and their 95% confidence intervals were based on the GLMM model. In 2-chr crosses and the 4-chr cross, 95% confidence intervals of asynapsis rate were constructed on the basis of the likelihood ratio to also capture the uncertainty in the cases when the zero asynapsis rate per mouse and per chromosome was observed.</p><p>On the basis of the nature of the dependence between the asynapsis rate and the length of the consubspecific PWD/PWD region on chromosomes of 2-chr crosses and the 4-chr cross, we fitted the data to segmented two-part continuous regression models (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib43">Muggeo, 2003</xref>).</p><p>We fitted the models for all the chromosomes separately (see <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="fig3sdata7">Figure 3—source data 7</xref>), being aware of the limitations caused by the lack of animals having specific lengths of the consubspecific PWD/PWD region in the respective chromosomes. As the best model describing the dependence of asynapsis rate on the lengths of PWD/PWD intervals, we selected piecewise linear models fitting 1) pooled data from 2-chr crosses and 2) pooled data from both 2-chr crosses and the 4-chr cross. These models are not severely affected by the lack of observations with specific lengths of the PWD/PWD segment neither by outliers.</p><p>All calculations were performed in R 3.2.2 (RRID:<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://scicrunch.org/resolver/SCR_001905">SCR_001905</ext-link>); the change point models and the GLMM models were fitted using the packages segmented and lme4, respectively (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib44">Muggeo and Ferrara, 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Bates et al., 2015</xref>).</p></sec></sec></body><back><ack id="ack"><title>Acknowledgements</title><p>We thank Simon Myers for sharing his unpublished data and critical comments, Attila Tóth for providing the HORMAD2 antibody, Mary Ann Handel and Linda Odenthal-Hesse for critical reading of this manuscript, David Green, Sarka Takacova, and members of the Forejt lab for their helpful comments, M Capek for help with analysis of confocal microscopy data, and J Perlova for her assistance with genotyping.

Your article has been favorably evaluated by Patricia Wittkopp (Senior Editor) and three reviewers, one of whom, Scott Keeney (Reviewer #1), is a member of our Board of Reviewing Editors.

Prior work dating back many years from the senior author's laboratory has documented hybrid sterility in crosses of PWD and B6 mouse strains. This impressive study tests the hypothesis that chromosome synapsis defects caused by heterozygosity across large chromosomal segments is a key contributor to sterility, rather than incompatibility of function of specific interacting gene pairs. The experimental approach is to test the effect of introgressing more or less random segments of homozygosity in the context of otherwise heterozygous PWD x B6 chromosome pairs, and evaluating chromosome synapsis and fertility. Two very important findings emerged: 1) that large stretches of conspecific homology along a chromosome greatly improves synapsis rates, and 2) the improved synapsis on one chromosome can improve interspecific synapsis on other chromosomes. Remarkably, the data strongly suggest a minimum threshold of ~27 Mbp for homozygosity being sufficient to support efficient chromosome synapsis. Moreover, restoring homozygosity for portions of four of the five smallest chromosomes is sufficient to rescue fertility in PWD x B6 hybrids. The results are interpreted in light of prior findings from other labs concerning apparent delays in repair of DSBs made within &quot;asymmetric&quot; hotspots, i.e., hotspots with allelic differences in binding by PRDM9. The molecular bases for the two major findings are speculated to be the consequence of increasing symmetric DSBs in item #1, and <italic>very speculatively</italic> by alteration of the mismatch repair machinery, in some unknown fashion, in item #2. These mechanisms would be nice to know, but are reasonably considered to be outside the scope of this study.</p><p>This is an intriguing set of data that is well presented and explained (with a few exceptions noted below). The experiments to define synapsis rates for each chromosome were nothing short of heroic. Similarly, the experiments to measure synapsis in consubspecific hybrids were quite a chore, but the result is very important. The paper will be of interest to a broad audience interested in meiosis, chromosome dynamics, and evolutionary mechanisms. There are a number of issues that need to be addressed to improve clarity of presentation or deal better with discussions of published work, but these can all be dealt with by changes to text. No additional experimentation is requested.</p><p>Essential revision:</p><p>1) Throughout: more care is needed with wording when discussing DSBs and hotspots. In some cases, text specifies DSBs when hotspots are meant, and in other cases, hotspots are mentioned when DSBs are meant. One example is the Abstract: &quot;symmetric DSBs&quot; is not really what is meant (DSBs are not symmetric per se, but rather the chromatin at hotspots is thought to be symmetric owing to biallelic action of PRDM9). Better to say &quot;DSBs within symmetric hotspots&quot;. (Also, symmetry hasn't been defined yet, so this will not be understandable in the Abstract.) Another example is in Results, which describes a &quot;correlation.… of asynapsis rate with symmetric DSB hotspots&quot;. What is meant is a correlation of asynapsis rate with (predicted) DSBs within symmetric hotspots. Similar concern applies to the end of the subsection “Small chromosomes are more susceptible to asynapsis in sterile F1 hybrids”: the data indicate that there is a requirement for a minimum number of DSBs within symmetric hotspots, not a minimum number of symmetric hotspots. Other examples can be found in the subsections “The meiotic asynapsis rate correlates with the presumed paucity of symmetric DSBs in individual chromosomes in sterile hybrids” and “Small stretches of consubspecific sequence restore the synapsis of intersubspecific chromosomes”.</p><p>2) The second section of Results is expected and not novel. It is by now very well established that asynapsis is associated with MSUC. The findings can be reduced to a couple of sentences within the first section, indicating that MSUC accompanies the observed asynapsis, as expected from numerous prior studies.</p><p>3) Subsection “On the chromosomal nature of hybrid sterility”, last paragraph: The Discussion implies that &quot;asymmetric DSBs&quot; (really, DSBs in asymmetric hotspots) do not get repaired because of excessive heterology (heteroduplex rejection). Davies et al. proposed instead that it is asymmetry of PRDM9-dependent chromatin remodeling that causes the repair delay. Moreover, Davies et al. provided fairly strong evidence that DNA sequence heterology is unlikely to be the root cause. Also, there is of high degrees of sequence polymorphism within recombining regions any of a large number of compatible F1 hybrids of inbred strains (e.g., in B6 x A/J). It isn't obvious why only those sequence polymorphisms that affect PRDM9 binding would influence the recombination reaction, while all other sequence polymorphisms nearby do not (i.e., polymorphisms in symmetric hotspots). Thus, the proposed contribution of sequence mismatches is not convincing, and needs to be discussed in a more balanced way. Care should be taken to also make clear that even the DSBs in asymmetric hotspots are repaired, because the data do not indicate that unrepaired DSBs are responsible for spermatocyte death. Delayed repair by interhomolog recombination or repair by intersister recombination could be explicitly mentioned.</p><p>4) Can the general magnitude of the chromosome synapsis trans-effect be calculated from the data?</p><p>5) Subsection “The minimal length of consubspecific sequence necessary to rescue meiotic chromosome synapsis”, last paragraph –: Can the authors provide statistical support for this statement?</p><p>6) End of subsection “Reversal of hybrid sterility by targeted suppression of asynapsis of four of the most asynapsis-sensitive autosomes”: Can the authors provide statistical support for this statement?</p><p>7) Please move all of the supplemental text (Materials and methods plus references) into the main text.</p><p>8) Please move examples of the primary immuno-FISH data (Figure 1—figure supplement 1A) into the main text.</p></body></sub-article><sub-article article-type="reply" id="SA2"><front-stub><article-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.34282.033</article-id><title-group><article-title>Author response</article-title></title-group></front-stub><body><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Essential revision:</p><p>1) Throughout: more care is needed with wording when discussing DSBs and hotspots.

Yet we strongly believe that the asymmetry of PRDM9-dependent chromatin remodeling can be most likely explained by delayed/imperfect PRDM9 binding due to degenerated binding motif on self chromosome. The erasure of PRDM9 binding motifs by meiotic drive is the essence of Myers and Donnelly's findings of PB6F1 male sterility. In their paper they say &quot;These findings reveal that subspecies-specific degradation of PRDM9 binding sites by meiotic drive, which steadily increases asymmetric PRDM9 binding, has impacts beyond simply changing hotspot positions, and strongly support a direct involvement in hybrid infertility&quot;. Moreover, 'heterology' is considered in Smagulova et al. paper as well (“we propose that sequence divergence generated by hot spot turnover may create an impediment for recombination in hybrids, potentially leading to reduced fertility and, eventually, speciation”).</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Also, there is of high degrees of sequence polymorphism within recombining regions any of a large number of compatible F1 hybrids of inbred strains (e.g., in B6 x A/J).</p></disp-quote><p>We suppose that it is the difference in degree of erasure of binding motifs between subspecies that is likely to generate the asymmetry.

[…] On average if predicted synapsis of three chromosomes is increased by ten percent, we expect 4.18% , (95% CI = 2.72% , 5.34% ) decrease of asynapsis rate of the fourth chromosome (P = 0.0266, log-log regression).”</p><p>The primary aim of the study was not to measure the <italic>trans</italic> effect, because we found it during the analysis of our data, and as such it was not designed for this aspect. Nevertheless, there is enough evidence for its presence, as documented by the comparison between expected and observed overall asynapsis rates, and quantified by differences in asynapsis rates on respective chromosomes in F1, 4-chr and 2-chr crosses. It would be rather speculative to extrapolate these observations further, to more general conclusions on the magnitude of the <italic>trans</italic> effect.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>5) Subsection “The minimal length of consubspecific sequence necessary to rescue meiotic chromosome synapsis”, last paragraph: Can the authors provide statistical support for this statement?</p></disp-quote><p>Statistical support was provided: “the location of the consubspecific sequence at the telomeric end was not essential for synapsis (P = 0.9573, F-test)”.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>6) End of subsection “Reversal of hybrid sterility by targeted suppression of asynapsis of four of the most asynapsis-sensitive autosomes”: Can the authors provide statistical support for this statement?</p></disp-quote><p>Statistical support was provided: “the probability of all four consomic chromosomes being synapsed was &gt; 0.7 (P = 0.0014, Mann-Whitney test).”</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>7) Please move all of the supplemental text (Materials and methods plus references) into the main text.</p></disp-quote><p>All supplemental text including references was moved to the main text.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>8) Please move examples of the primary immuno-FISH data (Figure 1—figure supplement 1A) into the main text.</p></disp-quote><p>Figure 1—figure supplement 1 was moved into the main text as Figure 1.</p></body></sub-article></article>
