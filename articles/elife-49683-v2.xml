the approach of choice for drug discovery due to its ability to extract drug-specific multi-layered data. In the field of epigenetics, such screening methods have suffered from a lack of tools sensitive to selective epigenetic perturbations. Here we describe a novel approach, Microscopic Imaging of Epigenetic Landscapes (MIEL), which captures the nuclear staining patterns of epigenetic marks and employs machine learning to accurately distinguish between such patterns. We validated the MIEL platform across multiple cells lines and using dose-response curves, to insure the fidelity and robustness of this approach for high content high throughput drug discovery. Focusing on noncytotoxic glioblastoma treatments, we demonstrated that MIEL can identify and classify epigenetically active drugs. Furthermore, we show MIEL was able to accurately rank candidate drugs by their ability to produce desired epigenetic alterations consistent with increased sensitivity to chemotherapeutic agents or with induction of glioblastoma differentiation.</p></abstract><abstract abstract-type="executive-summary"><title>eLife digest</title><p>Each cell contains a complete copy of a person’s genes coded in their DNA. However, for a cell to perform its specific role, it only needs a small fraction of this genetic information. The mechanisms that control which genes a cell is using fall under the umbrella of ‘epigenetics’ (meaning beyond genetics). These mechanisms involve changes in the way that DNA is organized inside the cell nucleus and changes in how accessible different parts of the genome are to various cellular components.</p><p>DNA is long and fragile so, to maintain its integrity, it is wrapped around protein complexes called histones. Adding chemical modifications to histones is one of the main epigenetic mechanisms that cells use to regulate which genes are turned on and off. Several methods allow researchers to read patterns of histone modification and use this information to derive what state a cell is in and how it might behave. Improving these methods is of particular interest in drug development, where this information could reveal the effects, and side-effects, of new treatments. Unfortunately, existing techniques are costly in both time and money, and they are not well suited to analyzing epigenetic changes caused by the large numbers of compounds tested during drug development.</p><p>To overcome this barrier, Farhy et al. have developed a new system called ‘Microscopic Imaging of the Epigenetic Landscape’ (MIEL for short). The system allows them to quickly analyze the epigenetic changes caused by each of a large number of different chemical compounds when they are used on cells. MIEL tags different histone modifications by staining each with a different color, and then uses automated microscopy to produce images. It then extracts information from these images using advanced image analysis tools. The changes induced by different drugs can then be compared and categorized using machine learning algorithms.</p><p>To test the MIEL system, Farhy et al. grew brain cancer cells (derived from human tumors) in the lab, and treated them with compounds that target proteins involved in histone modifications. Using their newly created pipeline, Farhy et al. were able to identify the unique epigenetic changes caused by these compounds, and train the system to correctly predict which type of drug the cells had been treated with. In a different set of experiments Farhy et al. demonstrate the utility of their new pipeline in identifying drugs that induce a set of epigenetic changes associated with a reduced ability to regrow tumors.</p><p>This new system could help screen thousands of compounds for their epigenetic effects, which could aid the design of new treatments for many diseases.</p></abstract><kwd-group kwd-group-type="author-keywords"><kwd>high content screening</kwd><kwd>glioblastoma</kwd><kwd>epigenetics</kwd></kwd-group><kwd-group kwd-group-type="research-organism"><title>Research organism</title><kwd>Human</kwd></kwd-group><funding-group><award-group id="fund1"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000900</institution-id><institution>California Institute for Regenerative Medicine</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>TG2-01162</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Farhy</surname><given-names>Chen</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund2"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100006436</institution-id><institution>Celgene</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>SCRA</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Terskikh</surname><given-names>Alexey V</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund3"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000002</institution-id><institution>National Institutes of Health</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>R01 NS066278</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Terskikh</surname><given-names>Alexey V</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund4"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100001804</institution-id><institution>Canada Research Chairs</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>Tier 1 Canada Research Chair</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Andrews</surname><given-names>David W</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund5"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100000024</institution-id><institution>Canadian Institutes of Health Research</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Andrews</surname><given-names>David W</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><funding-statement>The funders had no role in study design, data collection and interpretation, or the decision to submit the work for publication.</funding-statement></funding-group><custom-meta-group><custom-meta specific-use="meta-only"><meta-name>Author impact statement</meta-name><meta-value>A novel phenotypic screening platform based on immunofluorescent imaging of histone modifications enables accurate identification of cell fates and environmental perturbations.</meta-value></custom-meta></custom-meta-group></article-meta></front><body><sec id="s1" sec-type="intro"><title>Introduction</title><p>The epigenetic landscape of a cell is largely determined by the organization of its chromatin and the pattern of DNA and histone modifications. These confer differential accessibility to areas of the genome and through direct and in-direct regulation of all DNA-related processes, form the basis of the cellular phenotype (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Jenuwein and Allis, 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">Lawrence et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Berger, 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Goldberg et al., 2007</xref>). By collecting global information about the epigenetic landscape, for example using ATAC- or histone ChIP-seq, we can derive multilayered information regarding cellular states (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib47">Miyamoto et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib46">Mikkelsen et al., 2007</xref>). These include stable cell phenotypes such as quiescence, senescence, or cell fate, as well as transient changes such as those induced by cytokines and chemical compounds. However, current methods for collecting such information are not adapted for high-content drug screening. Over the past decade the decreasing cost and remarkable scalability of high content screening have made it a particularly attractive alternative for drug discovery. More recently, novel image processing tools coupled with multiparametric analysis and machine learning have significantly impacted our ability to investigate and understand the output of phenotypic screens (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Kang et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib65">Scheeder et al., 2018</xref>). Despite these advantages, such assays have not been adapted to extract and utilize information form the cellular epigenetic landscape.</p><p>While malignant glioblastoma is the most common and lethal brain tumor, current therapeutic options offer little prognostic improvement, so the median survival time has remained virtually unchanged for decades (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Jhanwar-Uniyal et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib51">Parvez, 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Burger and Green, 1987</xref>). Tumor-propagating cells (TPCs) are a subpopulation of glioblastoma cells with increased tumorigenic capability (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib53">Patel et al., 2014</xref>) operationally defined as early-passaged (&lt;15) glioblastoma cells propagated in serum-free medium (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib49">Nakano et al., 2008</xref>). Compared to the bulk of the tumor, TPCs are more resistant to drugs, such as temozolomide (TMZ) and radiation therapy (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Bao et al., 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib63">Safa et al., 2015</xref>). This resistance may explain the failure of traditional therapeutic strategies based on cytotoxic drugs targeting glioblastoma. Multiple approaches aimed at reducing or circumventing the resilience of TPCs have been proposed. These include targeting epigenetic enzymes (i.e., enzymes that write, remove, or read DNA and histone modifications) to increase sensitivity to cytotoxic treatments (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Jones et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib69">Strauss and Figg, 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">Lee et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib62">Romani et al., 2018</xref>); and differentiating TPCs to reduce their tumorigenic potential (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib72">von Wangenheim and Peterson, 1998</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib73">Von Wangenheim and Peterson, 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib74">von Wangenheim and Peterson, 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Lee et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib68">Song et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Garros-Regulez et al., 2016</xref>).</p><p>Here, we introduce Microscopic Imaging of the Epigenetic Landscape (MIEL), a novel high-content screening platform that profiles chromatin organization using the endogenous patterns of histone modifications present in all eukaryotic cells. We validate the platform across multiple cell lines and drug concentrations demonstrating its ability to classify epigenetically active compounds by molecular function, and its utility in identifying off-target drug effects.

MIEL takes advantage of epigenetic marks such as histone methylation and acetylation, which are always present in eukaryotic nuclei and can be revealed by immunostaining. MIEL analyzes the immunolabeling patterns of epigenetic marks using conventional image analysis methods for nuclei segmentation, feature extraction, and previously described machine-learning algorithms (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Collins et al., 2015</xref>) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1a</xref> and Materials and methods). Primarily, we utilized four histone modifications: H3K27me3 and H3K9me3, which are associated with condensed (closed) facultative and constitutive heterochromatin, respectively; H3K27ac, associated with transcriptionally active (open) areas of chromatin, especially at promoter and enhancer regions; and H3K4me1, associated with enhancers and other chromatin regions (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1a</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Creyghton et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib67">Shlyueva et al., 2014</xref>). To focus on the intrinsic pattern of epigenetic marks, we use only texture-associated features (e.g., Haralick's texture features [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Haralick et al., 1973</xref>], threshold adjacency statistics, and radial features [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Hamilton et al., 2007</xref>]) for multivariate analysis.

Treated cells were immuno-labeled for multiple histone modifications expected to exhibit alterations following drug treatment (H3K9me3, H3K27me3, H3K27ac and H3K4me1). Image analysis including nuclei segmentation and features extraction was conducted, as previously described (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Collins et al., 2015</xref>) on Acapella 2.6 (PerkinElmer). Phenotypic profiles were generated for each compound or control (DMSO) treated wells. These are vectors composed of 1048 (262 features per modification X four modifications) texture features derived from the staining of each histone modification and representing the average value for each feature across all stained cells in each cell population (drug or DMSO). When treatment reduced cell count to under 50 imaged nuclei per well, the compound was deemed toxic and excluded from analysis. Following feature normalization by z-score, we calculated the Euclidean distance between vectors of the compounds and DMSO- treated cells. These distances were then normalized (z-score) to the average distance between DMSO replicates and the standard deviation of these distances. Compounds with a distance z-score of greater than three were defined as active (see Materials and methods section). This analysis identified 122 compounds that induced significant epigenetic changes. Active compounds were not uniformly distributed across all functional drug categories. Rather, we identified 10 categories in which 50% of the drugs were categorized as active and nontoxic and 13 categories in which 25% or fewer of the drugs induced detectable epigenetic alterations following a 24 hr treatment (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1b</xref>).</p><p>To compare MIEL with current thresholding methods, we repeated the calculation using mean fluorescence intensity for all histone modifications by normalizing (z-score) each drug against DMSO; active compounds were defined as compounds for which z-scored intensity for at least one of the histone modifications was greater than three or less than −3. As a result, we identified 94 active compounds, which were distributed across functional categories similarly to MIEL-identified compounds (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1b</xref>). For each functional category, the number of compounds identified as active using thresholding was smaller than the number identified using MIEL (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1b</xref>) demonstrating MIEL’s increased detection sensitivity over standard thresholding.</p><p>To determine the contribution of individual histone modifications, we repeated both MIEL and thresholding analyses individually for each of the four modifications. Using MIEL-based analysis, a single modification yielded similar detection rates to the combination of modifications across most functional categories (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s2">Figure 1—figure supplement 2a</xref>). Using intensity-based analysis, individual modifications yielded lower detection rates compared to the combination of modifications and displayed equal or reduced detection rates when compared to MIEL in all categories and modifications (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s2">Figure 1—figure supplement 2a</xref>). Of note, 3 of the four modifications used for MIEL analysis showed similar detection rates across most of the functional categories. However, detection rates using H3K27me3 were consistently reduced across most active categories (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s2">Figure 1—figure supplement 2a</xref>) except for EZH1/2 inhibitors, possibly due to the role these enzymes play in regulating this posttranslational modification. To further compare MIEL and thresholding, we estimated the magnitude of epigenetic alterations induced by active compounds. We calculated the fold increase in distance from DMSO (normalized to average distance between DMSO replicates) as well as the fold change in fluorescence intensity for active compounds in each category. In all categories, MIEL showed an increased effect (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s2">Figure 1—figure supplement 2b</xref>).</p><p>These results demonstrate that, across all tested epigenetic marks, detecting epigenetically active compounds was markedly improved using the MIEL method compared to current image-based thresholding methods.</p></sec><sec id="s2-3"><title>MIEL correctly classifies epigenetic compounds by function and detects off-target effects</title><p>One key advantage of phenotypic profiling methods like MIEL is the ability to classify compounds by function and identify nonspecific effects through comparison with profiles of well-defined controls. To assess whether MIEL could correctly group compounds by function, we applied discriminant analysis (DA) to all active, nontoxic compounds from categories that had at least three such compounds (85 compounds; seven categories and DMSO). Two replicates from each drug and 38 DMSO replicates were used as a training set for a quadratic DA, using all texture features derived from images of the four histone modifications. The third replicate for each compound, as well as 10 DMSO replicates, was used as a test set to validate the model. Results showed that MIEL separated multiple categories of epigenetically active drugs with an average accuracy of 91.4% (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1c,d</xref>). Although many of the epigenetically active compounds induced alterations in average fluorescence (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s2">Figure 1—figure supplement 2b</xref>), a DA utilizing intensity measurements from all four channels was ineffective at separating the various categories and yielded only 51.6% average accuracy (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s3">Figure 1—figure supplement 3a</xref>). To test whether individual histone modification textures contain sufficient information to distinguish between the various drug classes, we performed DA using features derived from each modification. Although this degraded MIEL’s ability to separate compound subclasses, which affected similar changes in histone modification such as Class I and Pan HDAC inhibitors, MIEL was still able to separate major categories, such as histone phosphorylation and deacetylation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s3">Figure 1—figure supplement 3b</xref>).</p><p>DNA labeling dyes such as DAPI and Hoechst can partially recapitulate the staining pattern of H3K9me3, which labels constitutive heterochromatin. To test the ability of DNA labeling dyes to capture information regarding chromatin organization and their usefulness for function based classification, we used texture features derived from the DAPI channel to repeat the functional classification. This yielded an overall classification accuracy of 65.6% (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s3">Figure 1—figure supplement 3b</xref>) compared with 86.4% provided by H3K9me3 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s3">Figure 1—figure supplement 3b</xref>). Despite reduced overall accuracy, it is evident that DAPI and other DNA dyes may be an informative and cheap alternative to histone staining in at least some applications when the analyzed epigenetic landscape are very distinct.</p><p>Of note, the compound library used in this study included Pan HDACi, Class I HDACi, and Class I HDACi, known to also target HDAC6. HDAC inhibitors targeting both Class I and HDAC six displayed the same profile as Pan HDAC, and DA showed the two categories to be undistinguishable. This was likely due to the high expression of HDAC Class I and HDAC six and low expression of other HDACs in the GBM2 glioblastoma line (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s4">Figure 1—figure supplement 4a,b,c</xref>).</p><p>Of the 85 compounds tested, 7 (8.2%) were identified as active but were misclassified by MIEL. One of these was valproic acid, a commonly used anticonvulsant (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib54">Peterson and Naunton, 2005</xref>) which also functions as a Pan HDAC inhibitor at high concentrations (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib55">Phiel et al., 2001</xref>). Though valproic acid is expected to inhibit HDACs only at high concentrations (&gt;1.2 mM), a short 24 hr treatment induced detectable epigenetic changes even at low concentrations (&lt;30 µM). However, when we quantified H3K27ac and H3K27me3 immunofluorescence intensity at these concentrations, no increase in histone acetylation or decrease in histone methylation similar to other Pan HDAC inhibitors (TSA, SAHA; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s5">Figure 1—figure supplement 5a</xref>) was seen. To test, whether observed epigenetic changes resulted in corresponding transcriptomic alterations, we sequenced RNA from GBM2 cells treated with either DMSO, TSA, SAHA or valproic acid (15 µM) for 24 hr and identified all genes altered by at least one of the drugs (as compared to DMSO; 118 genes). This analysis indicated that the Pan HDAC inhibitors induced similar transcriptomic changes that were not apparent in the transcriptomic profile of valproic acid-treated cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s5">Figure 1—figure supplement 5b</xref>). To test whether MIEL profiles reflected global drug-induced transcriptomic profiles, FPKM values for all expressed genes (FPKM &gt;1 in at least one cell population) were used to calculate the Euclidean distance between all 4 cell populations. FPKM-based distances were then correlated to image texture feature-based distances, which yielded a high and significant correlation between these metrics (R = 0.91, pv &lt;0.05; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s5">Figure 1—figure supplement 5c</xref>).</p><p>Taken together, these demonstrate a unique ability of the MIEL approach to identify epigenetically active compounds, to accurately categorize them according to their molecular mechanism of action, and to detect off-target effects of compounds with known mechanism of action.</p></sec><sec id="s2-4"><title>Unbiased detection of compound concentration-dependent effect on cellular epigenetic state</title><p>As drugs vary in potency, predicting the function of unknown drugs relies on generating functional category-specific profiles that remain valid over a range of activity levels.

To estimate the impact of toxicity on drug induced profile changes and its contribution to drug misclassification across a range of concentrations, we plotted z-scored distance from DMSO (effect size) against z-scored nuclei count (a proxy for cytotoxicity) for GBM2 cells treated at a range of drug concentrations (0.1, 0.3, 1, 3, 10 µM). This demonstrated that some compound classes, such as Aurora and JAK inhibitors, induce epigenetic alterations only in concentrations at which cell count is significantly reduced, whether through toxicity or direct effect on proliferation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2b</xref> – dark blue and pink respectively), while other compounds, such as HDAC inhibitors, characteristically have a concentration range where epigenetic alterations are not accompanied by reduced cell counts (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2b</xref> – green and yellow).

This revealed a significant positive correlation between all 4 cell lines pointing to similarities in their drug sensitivity profiles and demonstrating the robustness of the MIEL read out (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2c,d</xref>). To assess the ability of MIEL to group compounds by function across multiple cell lines we employed DA to classify DMSO and drug treated TPCs across these 4 GBM lines. This analysis enabled accurate separation of cells treated with drugs modulating distinct functions, such as EZH1/2 or SIRT inhibitors (5 and 3 compounds respectively; mean 100% accuracy; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2e</xref>).

One critical problem is the lack of informative markers faithfully reporting GBM differentiation that could be used for high-throughput screening (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib53">Patel et al., 2014</xref>). The lack of informative markers for GBM differentiation and the ability of MIEL to identify compounds producing desired epigenetic alterations prompted us to test the feasibility of using this approach to screen for drugs inducing GBM TPCs differentiation.</p><p>For this, we first tested the ability of MIEL to discriminate between different cell fates. We analyzed 3 cell types: primary human fibroblasts, induced pluripotent stem cells (iPSCs) derived from these fibroblasts, and neural progenitor cells (NPCs) differentiated from the iPSCs. The fibroblasts were isolated from three unrelated donors (WT-61, WT-101, WT-126) and used to obtain corresponding iPSC and NPC lines. Cellular identities of the 3 cell types were verified by immune-fluorescence for Sox2 and Oct4 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4a</xref>), and MIEL analysis was carried out using data from either H3K4me1 and H3K9me3 or H3K27ac and H3K27me3 staining, with both combinations providing similar results. Multivariate centroids were calculated for each cell population and plotted on a distance map to visualize the relative Euclidean distance between various cell populations. The fibroblasts, iPSCs, and NPCs each segregate to form three visually distinct territories (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s1">Figure 4—figure supplement 1c</xref>). We separated the nine lines by cell-fates using DA, which showed an accurate separation of the different cell-fates across all three donors (average accuracy 100%; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4b</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s1">Figure 4—figure supplement 1e</xref>). A similar analysis aimed at separate the different donors showed only low accuracy (average accuracy 55.5%; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4c</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s1">Figure 4—figure supplement 1f</xref>). To determine whether it was possible to discriminate between individual cells with different fates, a Support Vector Machine (SVM) classifier was trained on a subset of fibroblasts, iPSCs, and NPCS from the three donors. Classification of the test set indicated a high degree of separation between the different fates at a single cell level (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s1">Figure 4—figure supplement 1b,d</xref>). Additionally, MIEL analysis (using only H3K9me3) was able to discriminate between primary hematopoietic cell types freshly isolated from mouse bone marrow, namely lymphoid, myeloid, and stem/progenitors (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s2">Figure 4—figure supplement 2</xref>). However, closely related hematopoietic stem and progenitor cells were not readily separated (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s2">Figure 4—figure supplement 2</xref>).</p><fig-group><fig id="fig4" position="float"><label>Figure 4.</label><caption><title>MIEL can distinguish between cell fates and identify glioblastoma differentiation.</title><p>(<bold>A</bold>) Hoechst 33342 stained (blue), and Sox2 (red) and Oct4 (green) immunofluorescence labeled fibroblasts (Sox2<sup>-</sup>/Oct4<sup>-</sup>), iPSCs (Sox2<sup>+</sup>/Oct4<sup>+</sup>) and NPCs (Sox2<sup>+</sup>/Oct4<sup>-</sup>). Scale bar, 50 µm.

These concentrations were used for all subsequent experiments (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="supp1">Supplementary file 1</xref> - Table S7). Because most of these compounds are known for their cytotoxic effects, we verified the growth rates of drug-treated glioblastoma cells. With the exception of digoxin, which was cytostatic, drug treatment resulted in growth rates comparable with that induced by serum or BMP4 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5s2">Figure 5—figure supplement 2a</xref>). We used immunofluorescence to test for expression of core TPC transcription factors (Sox2, Sall2, Brn2 and Olig2).

GBM2 cells were treated with DMSO, serum, Bmp4, or each of the eight candidate compounds; after 3 days, RNA was extracted and sequenced. Transcriptomic profiles of the eight compounds were ranked according to average Euclidean distance (based on FPKM values for all expressed genes) from serum and BMP4-treated cells. To safeguard against potential artefacts of cytotoxicity, we compared gene expression-based ranking with measured cellular growth rates from drug treatments and found no positive correlation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5s2">Figure 5—figure supplement 2c</xref>). Next, we compared Sox2 levels under all treatment conditions to determine whether expression of this transcription factor can identify drugs that best mimic serum or BMP4. We found no positive correlation between Sox2 expression and the transcriptomic-based rankings (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5s2">Figure 5—figure supplement 2d</xref>), suggesting that Sox2 levels alone are insufficient to stratify the compounds. Finally, to compare MIEL-based signatures to the transcriptomic profile, we ranked MIEL readouts of cells treated with the eight drugs according to average Euclidean distance from serum- or Bmp4-treated cells (calculated using texture features derived from images of H3K27ac, H3K27me3, H3K9me3 and H3K4me1). Comparison of the MIEL-based metric with the gene expression-based metric revealed a high degree of positive correlation between MIEL- and gene expression-based rankings (Pearson correlation coefficient R = 0.92, p&lt;0.001; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5c</xref>). To further visualize these results, we constructed heat maps depicting fold change in expression levels of genes associated with several GO terms enriched by serum and Bmp4. Our top candidate, etoposide, altered expression of a large portion of genes in similar fashion to that of serum and BMP4; in contrast, the lowest-ranking candidate, digoxin, induced changes in gene expression, which were rather different from serum and BMP4 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5d</xref>).</p><p>Taken together, the above results reflect the unique ability of MIEL to identify molecules that shift epigenetic signature of glioblastoma TPCs towards DGCs.

However, separating similar classes (e.g., Aurora and JAK inhibitors, which affect histone phosphorylation, or Pan and Class I HADCs, which affect histone acetylation) required staining for at least one additional histone modification (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1d</xref>). Despite their many advantages, cellular assays, including high-content assays, are often used as secondary screens for epigenetic drugs due to multiplicity of enzyme family members and an inability to determine direct enzymatic activity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib44">Martinez and Simeonov, 2015</xref>). Consequently, MIEL’s ability to separate closely related functional categories on top of other advantages make this profiling approach an attractive alternative for primary screens.</p></sec><sec id="s3-2"><title>Coherence across cell lines can provide vital input for personalized medicine</title><p>Phenotypic profiling methods have been previously used to identify genotype‐specific drug responses by comparing profiles across multiple isogenic lines (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Breinig et al., 2015</xref>). Here we show that activity of biologics (i.e., serum and Bmp4) that induces glioblastoma differentiation, as well as that of 57 epigenetic compounds, was significantly correlated across four different primary glioblastoma lines (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2c,d,e</xref>; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4h</xref>). We also showed that variation in activity levels correlated with target expression levels and that various categories can be distinguished across cell lines. Together, these suggest that MIEL could be used to identify cell lines showing an aberrant reaction to selected drugs and, therefore, aid in identifying optimal treatments for individual patients. Similar applications have previously been used to tailor specific kinase inhibitors to patients with chronic lymphocytic leukemia (CLL) who display venetoclax resistance (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib50">Oppermann et al., 2016</xref>).</p></sec><sec id="s3-3"><title>Non-cytotoxic treatments for Glioblastoma</title><p>Given the limited success of cytotoxic drugs in treating glioblastoma, we focused on alternative approaches: (1) epigenetic drugs aimed at sensitizing glioblastoma TPCs to such treatments, and (2) inducing glioblastoma differentiation. We have demonstrated MIEL’s ability to rank candidate drug activity to correctly predict the best candidates for achieving the desired effect. The importance of this is highlighted in large (hundreds of thousands of compounds) chemical library screens, which typically identify many possible hits needing to be reduced and confirmed in secondary screens (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Hughes et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib70">Strovel et al., 2004</xref>).</p></sec><sec id="s3-4"><title>BET inhibitors modulate expression of MGMT</title><p>Our results show a significant correlation between BET inhibitor activity, as defined by MIEL (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3d</xref>), and their ability to synergize and increase TPC sensitivity to TMZ and reveal a previously unknown role for BET inhibitors in reducing MGMT expression (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3e,f,g</xref>). Previous studies have demonstrated upregulation of several BET transcription factors in glioblastomas (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib52">Pastori et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib75">Wadhwa and Nicolaides, 2016</xref>) and multiple pre-clinical studies have investigated the potential of BET inhibition as a single drug treatment for glioblastoma (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib76">Xu et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Ishida et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Cheng et al., 2013</xref>). However, while clinical trials with the BET inhibitor OTX015 demonstrated low toxicity at doses achieving biologically active levels, no detectable clinical benefits were found (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Hottinger et al., 2016</xref>). This prompted approaches using drug combination treatments (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib61">Ramadoss and Mahadevan, 2018</xref>) such as combining HDACi and BETi (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Heinemann et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Bhadury et al., 2014</xref>). The mechanism by which BETi induces increased TMZ sensitivity has not been described. Recently, a distal enhancer regulating MGMT expression was identified (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Chen et al., 2018</xref>). Activation of this enhancer by targeting a Cas9-p300 fusion to its genomic locus increased MGMT expression while deletion of this enhancer reduced MGMT expression (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Chen et al., 2018</xref>). As BET transcription factors bind elevated H3K27ac levels found in enhancers (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib66">Sengupta et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib41">Lovén et al., 2013</xref>), this may suggest a possible mechanism for BETi-induced reduction of MGMT expression, which in turn results in increased sensitivity to the DNA alkylating agent TMZ.</p><p>Silencing the MGMT gene through promoter methylation has long been known to increase responsiveness to TMZ treatment and improve prognosis in patients with glioblastoma (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Karayan-Tapon et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Hegi et al., 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Esteller et al., 2000</xref>). Yet Despite that, clinical trials that combine TMZ and MGMT inhibitors have not improved therapeutic outcomes in such patients, possibly due to the 50% reduction in dose of TMZ, which is required to avoid hematologic toxicity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib58">Quinn et al., 2009a</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib59">Quinn et al., 2009b</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib60">Quinn et al., 2009c</xref>). Thus, BETi offers an attractive line of research, though further studies are needed to determine whether the elevated sensitivity of glioblastoma to BETi, and its ability to reduce MGMT expression could be exploited to improve patient outcome.</p></sec><sec id="s3-5"><title>MIEL provides a reliable proxy of the transcriptomic profile</title><p>We analyzed serum and BMP4, two established biologicals known to induce glioblastoma differentiation in culture (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">Lee et al., 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib56">Piccirillo et al., 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib57">Pollard et al., 2009</xref>) and established signatures of the differentiated glioblastoma cells based on the pattern of epigenetic marks that could be applied across several genetic backgrounds. This is the first time that a signature for glioblastoma differentiation suitable for high-throughput drug screening has been obtained. Indeed, results of previous studies using bulk glioblastoma analysis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Carén et al., 2015</xref>) or single-cell sequencing (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib53">Patel et al., 2014</xref>) could not be readily applied for high-throughput screening. As a proof of principle, we analyzed the Prestwick chemical library (1200 compounds) to validate MIEL’s ability to select and prioritize small molecules, which mimic the epigenetic and transcriptomic effects of serum and BMP4. Surprisingly, we observed that the degree of reduction in endogenous SOX2 protein levels following drug treatment did not correlate with the degree of differentiation assessed by global gene expression (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5s2">Figure 5—figure supplement 2d</xref>); in contrast, MIEL-based metrics did correlate. This result, taken together with MIEL’s ability to distinguish multiple cells types (iPSCs, NPCs, fibroblasts, hematopoietic lineages; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4b,c</xref>; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s2">Figure 4—figure supplement 2</xref>) across several genetic backgrounds, demonstate that the MIEL approach can readily identify compounds inducing desired changes in cell fate and that it can serve as a cost-effective tool for prioritizing compounds during the primary screenings.</p><p>By tapping into the wealth of information contained within the cellular epigenetic landscape through modern high-content profiling and machine-learning techniques, the MIEL approach represents a valuable tool for high-throughput screening and drug discovery and is especially relevant when the desired cellular outcome cannot be readily defined using conventional approaches.</p></sec></sec><sec id="s4" sec-type="materials|methods"><title>Materials and methods</title><sec id="s4-1"><title>Cell culture</title><p>Monolayer cultures of patient-derived GMB TPCs were propagated on Matrigel-coated plates in DMEM:F12 Neurobasal Medium (1:1; Gibco), 1% B27 supplement (Gibco), 10% BIT 9500 (StemCell Technologies), 1 mM glutamine, 20 ng/ml EGF (Chemicon), 20 ng/ml bFGF, 5 µg/ml insulin (Sigma), and 5 mM nicotinamide (Sigma).

Raw feature values were normalized by z-scoring to the average and standard deviation of all populations being compared. All cells in each population were used to calculate center vectors, and each population contained at least 50 cells. Activity level for each drug was determined by calculating the distance from DMSO. For this, feature values of all DMSO replicates center vectors were used to calculate the DMSO center vector. Euclidean distance of each compound and each DMSO replicate to the DMSO center vector was calculated. Distances were z-scored to the average distance and standard deviation of DMSO replicates from the DMSO center vector.

This method was developed from a prior multivariate image analysis (Collins et al., 2015) in the context of epigenetic modulation. Here the core idea is to rely on a set of structural features of epigenetic marks (H3K27me3, H3K9me3, H3K27ac and H3K4me) as readouts of epigenetic modulation. These structural features were extracted via machine-learning algorithms described previously. To demonstrate the utility of this method, the authors first showed that the current approach is more sensitive than prior &quot;intensity&quot;-based approaches to detect the effects of small-molecule epigenetic modulators. The authors then showed that the multi-variate readouts correlate with treatment doses and the compounds sharing common targets in the context of multiple cell lines. With this approach, the authors further identified the epigenetic modulators that synergistically work with TMZ and radiation and distinguished the cell fates/differentiation of several types of cells. Novelty of this work mainly lies in the machine-learning-based algorithm to extract a set of structural features of chromatin as readouts. However, the reviewer feels that this work is largely an incremental data analysis method with multiple limitations as detailed below.</p><p>1) To examine epigenetic modulation, many robust approaches such as ATAC-seq/ChIP-seq have been developed as noted by the authors. Their methods provide rich information with terrific resolution. In contrast, various Western-blot assays or image-intensity-based assays have been developed to examine the global levels of certain epigenetic marks (H3K27me3, H3K9me3, H3K27ac and H3K4me). Merits of the MIEL largely lies between the two conventional approaches. However, the challenge of data collections (three or four sets of data for a treatment condition) and the complexity of data processing (feature extraction and combination) significantly limited the broad use of this approach.</p><p>2) In contrast with the conventional image-intensity-based assays, MIEL only revealed around 10 additional compounds among &gt;200 candidates that alter the epigenetic landscape (data of Figure 1B). However, it is not clear about the mechanism that the &quot;10&quot; additional compounds cannot be identified with the conventional image-intensity-based assays but can be revealed with MIEL. It is not clear how the authors ruled out the possibility that the changes of epigenetic landscapes associated with the indirect outcomes of off-target effects of the 10 compounds. If it is the case, the positive readouts become irreverent to the primary targets of these compounds.</p><p>3) The underlying molecular mechanism of MIEL is not clear. The altered structural features are very descriptive and may not link to perturbation in a casual manner. As a result, it is likely that the effects of many epigenetic modulators may not be readily detected with MIEL; the MIEL-detectable changes may not be directly relevant to epigenetic biology. As a result, MIEL needs to be fully validated before its implementation in a specific context. Meanwhile, ATAC-seq/ChIP-seq, Western-blot assays and image-intensity based assays are often developed on the basis of molecular mechanisms of epigenetic modulation. The latter are thus more robust given the direct causal relationship between the targets of interest and their function-related readouts.</p><p>In short, in the context of many alternative conventional approaches, the complexity and limitations of MIEL outweigh its merits. The reviewer doesn't feel that the quality of this manuscript reaches the standard of <italic>eLife</italic> in terms of novelty and broad impact.</p><p><italic>Reviewer #2:</italic></p><p>Chen Farhy and colleagues report on an elegant high-throughput way to use image analysis that can identify epigenetically active drugs, classify them by molecular function, and assess candidate drugs for their ability to increase sensitivity to chemotherapeutic agents. This is a really understudied area that has traditionally required expensive plate reader based tools to quantify. The manuscript is very detailed and thorough and has addressed the utility of the MIEL tool in a wide range of drug screening settings.</p><p>The two major concerns are the lack of certain control conditions necessary to support the authors claims.</p><p>1) The authors call their phenotypic screening platform &quot;Microscopic Imaging of Epigenetic Landscape (MIEL)&quot;, and the imaging is solely based on texture features of four immunolabeled epigenetic marks. However, the texture of those histone modifications can be correlated to the general structure and texture of the DNA. The authors exclude compounds that lead to a cell count &gt; 50 nuclei/ well, however, if a compound induces significant apoptosis with ~50% cell death, the texture features could pick up chromatin condensation and thereby potentially generate false-positive hits.</p><p>It would be helpful to see if there is a correlation between nuclei count and MIEL z-scores.</p><p>Furthermore, the authors claim that they can use MIEL to analyse dose-dependent effects from drug treatment. Yet, in light of the concern above, they cannot be sure whether they detect the pharmacological effect or a toxic effect that is not related to epigenetic changes. Concerning is the fact that the initial screen was conducted for just 24h and still was sufficient to separate the drug classes in clusters. However, later in the manuscript the authors increased the treatment times to 2 or 3 days, which reflects much more the time frame required to induce detectable epigenetic changes.</p><p>It would be great if the authors could put a few cytotoxic drugs through their pipeline that act not via epigenetic mechanisms but rather are inducers of apoptosis, necrosis, DNA damage, or cell-cycle arrest, and see whether they cluster with any of the epigenetic modifier classes or form separate clusters.</p><p>2) The second major concern is that, for many of the analyses it seems almost irrelevant whether all four histone modifications are taken into account, or just either of the two pairs, or just one of the four marks. This could be an indicator, that the texture features that are being extracted are not specific to the histone modifications, but rather general changes to DNA structure.</p><p>To clarify this, it would be recommended to stain just for DNA structure (DAPI) and overall Histone structure (H3), treat with representative compounds of the drug screen, and extract the same/ comparable texture features that were used for MIEL. Using DAPI and H3 texture, is it then also possible to discriminate between the compounds?</p><p>The second experiment to confirm that the changes in texture are due to a change in Histone modification landscape and not due to non-specific alteration of DNA structure, is to add a second detection method for the specific Histone modifications. ATAC sequencing after treatment with and without representative compounds of the drug screen should provide biological evidence for the phenotypic results of the image analysis.</p></body></sub-article><sub-article article-type="reply" id="sa2"><front-stub><article-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.49683.sa2</article-id><title-group><article-title>Author response</article-title></title-group></front-stub><body><p>[Editors’ note: the author responses to the first round of peer review follow.]</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Reviewer #1:</p><p>In this manuscript, Farhy and coworkers developed an image-based analysis to examine epigenetic landscapes.

Indeed, ATAC-seq/ChIP-seq provide terrific resolution when a limited number of experimental conditions are studied, and we do not intend for MIEL to be compared with ATAC-seq/ChIP-seq in this setting. However, ATAC-seq/ChIP-seq are not amenable (either technically or economically) for high-throughput drug screening campaigns, which involve several hundred cells per analysis and several hundred thousands of compounds per screening. In contrast, the MIEL platform is intended to be employed for high-throughput phenotypic screening to improve drug discovery. ATAC-seq/ChIP-seq and MIEL platforms would thus complement, rather than compete with, each other by addressing different needs and applications.</p><p>The comparison to image-intensity-based assays is indeed warranted, and our data extensively document the remarkable superiority of MIEL over the intensity-based assays (Figure 1B; Figure 1—figure supplement 2A, B; Figure 1—figure supplement 3A).</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>However, the challenge of data collections (three or four sets of data for a treatment condition) and the complexity of data processing (feature extraction and combination) significantly limited the broad use of this approach.</p></disp-quote><p>The challenges of data collection are similar for the intensity-based assays and MIEL because even one channel acquisition is sufficient for both; however, single-channel MIEL is still far superior to the intensity-based assays (Figure 1—figure supplement 2A, B). In fact, we would argue that data collection is easier with MIEL, because a common standard set of epigenetic marks is used for all types of samples and analyses, and the specific antibodies could be prepared and tested in advance for all subsequent assays. As for the complexity of data processing (feature extraction and combination), we employ a previously described pipeline (Collins et al., 2015; and Oppermann et al., 2016), which is entirely automated, has a step-by-step manual, requires no computation or mathematics training, and is routinely executed by technical personnel in our laboratory. Furthermore, similar software packages are available that do not rely on pre-written scripts but rather utilize an easy-to-use building-block interface (e.g., CellProfiler).</p><p>While we appreciate that in many fields it could be difficult to interpret the mechanism behind the models constructed through machine-learning algorithms, the utility of such approaches is widely recognized and they represent the leading edge in the current drug discovery process.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>2) In contrast with the conventional image-intensity-based assays, MIEL only revealed around 10 additional compounds among &gt;200 candidates that alter the epigenetic landscape (data of Figure 1B).</p></disp-quote><p>We apologize for insufficient clarity in our explanation, which has led to this misunderstanding. First, it is important to note that the power of the MIEL platform lies in its ability to identify the multiparametric signature of epigenetically active compounds and thus accurately classify such compounds according to their mechanism of action, as demonstrated in our study (Figure 1C, D). In contrast, we showed that intensity-based assays lack such classification power (Figure 1—figure supplement 3A). It is predominantly this advantage of MIEL over intensity-based analysis that we are aiming to highlight.</p><p>We apologize that we did not clearly state the different number of compounds identified by MIEL vs. intensity-based analyses in the original manuscript. MIEL identified 122 active compounds that induced significant epigenetic changes, whereas the intensity-based approach identified 94 active compounds using the same stringent criteria (outside ± 3 z-scores). The additional 28 compounds identified by MIEL cover virtually all functional categories of epigenetic activity (Figure 1B and Figure 1—figure supplement 2).</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>However, it is not clear about the mechanism that the &quot;10&quot; additional compounds cannot be identified with the conventional image-intensity-based assays but can be revealed with MIEL. It is not clear how the authors ruled out the possibility that the changes of epigenetic landscapes associated with the indirect outcomes of off-target effects of the 10 compounds. If it is the case, the positive readouts become irreverent to the primary targets of these compounds.</p></disp-quote><p>The reviewer raises the possibility that these 28 additional compounds identified as active by MIEL, but not by intensity-based analysis, elicit off-target effects. Of the 122 compounds that were identified as active by MIEL, 85 were used for functional classification analysis (Figure 1C, D; the remaining 37 compounds belonged to functional classes with an insufficient number of active compounds to support classification algorithms). Of these 85 compounds, 10 were detected as active by MIEL but not by intensity-based analysis, and 8 of these 10 compounds (80%) were correctly classified to the expected functional category based on their known mechanism of action. Therefore, if these compounds do induce off-target effects, they are not dominant and do not preclude correct classification.</p><p>We believe that MIEL’s ability to register off-target effects should be considered as an advantage, enabling a measure of drug specificity in addition to drug activity. Both academic labs and pharmaceutical companies (e.g., Recursion Pharmaceuticals) have identified and successfully exploited off-target effects of compounds. For instance, we identified distinct concentration-dependent patterns for some epigenetic compounds, suggesting possible divergent cell fate outcomes at low vs. high concentrations (Figure 2A). We suggest that this ability further supports the relevance and superiority of the MIEL pattern-based analysis compared with intensity-based readouts.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>3) The underlying molecular mechanism of MIEL is not clear. The altered structural features are very descriptive and may not link to perturbation in a casual manner. As a result, it is likely that the effects of many epigenetic modulators may not be readily detected with MIEL; the MIEL-detectable changes may not be directly relevant to epigenetic biology. As a result, MIEL needs to be fully validated before its implementation in a specific context. Meanwhile, ATAC-seq/ChIP-seq, Western-blot assays and image-intensity based assays are often developed on the basis of molecular mechanisms of epigenetic modulation. The latter are thus more robust given the direct causal relationship between the targets of interest and their function-related readouts.</p></disp-quote><p>We apologize for the lack of clarity in our explanation of the relationship between the MIEL-detectable changes and epigenetic biology. The mechanism of MIEL analysis is deeply rooted in the topology of the cellular epigenome and thus causally linked to perturbations of the epigenome. For example, changing the cell fate (differentiation) involves specific changes in the open/closed chromatin loci, which until now have been studied in bulk, averaging thousands or more cellular states. In contrast, MIEL is capable of assessing the epigenetic landscape in single cells. The sensitivity of MIEL approach, namely, the minimum change of epigenetic landscape that can be detected by MIEL in a single cell is, indeed, a key question and can only be answered experimentally.</p><p>Our present study is focused on addressing this very question in great detail using three specific contexts. Namely, we have validated MIEL’s utility and power (1) to detect and cluster diverse compounds using a large collection of established epigenetic drugs, (2) to distinguish different stages of cellular differentiation and identify signatures of such stages using a primary human glioblastoma model, and (3) to inform the mechanism of drug function using a model of TMZ synergy with PARP or BRD inhibitors. We verified the accuracy of MIEL-based readouts for these three specific contexts using previously published data or whole genome sequencing. Such experiments provide direct validation of MIEL in these contexts.</p><p>As a testimony to the breakthrough that we have achieved, we note that none of the applications demonstrated in the present manuscript was previously possible using a single universal set of markers applicable to any mammalian cell. Thus, the generalizability of our approach surpasses all previous ones. Moreover, unlike “…traditional cell painting approaches rely on unspecified distribution of arbitrary markers” (Pennisi E. Cell painting highlights responses to drugs and toxins. Science 2015:352;877-878), our approach directly interrogates the nuclear distribution (pattern) of epigenetic marks. Such epigenetic marks and their distribution have a well-defined biological meaning. For instance, H3K9me3 mark largely demarcates close/inactive chromatin, while H3K9ac marks labels accessible/expressed chromatin.</p><p>Indeed, the topography of epigenetic marks in the nucleus is directly related to the topology of active/inactive chromatin. Epigenetic marks are universal determinants of cellular fate and are present in all eukaryotic cells. Our discovery that these marks provide unique and importantly, interpretable information about the epigenetic landscape of single cells is not an incremental advance. Instead, it led to the novel insight that similar distributions of nuclear epigenetic marks obtained from image-based analysis equate with similar cellular identity, at least in the several examples described in our manuscript. This contrasts with many conventional phenotypic screening configurations, where cells with similar “distribution of arbitrary markers” have no mechanistic basis to equate with similar cellular identity.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>In short, in the context of many alternative conventional approaches, the complexity and limitations of MIEL outweigh its merits. The reviewer doesn't feel that the quality of this manuscript reaches the standard of eLife in terms of novelty and broad impact.</p><p>Reviewer #2:</p><p>[…] The two major concerns are the lack of certain control conditions necessary to support the authors claims.</p><p>1) The authors call their phenotypic screening platform &quot;Microscopic Imaging of Epigenetic Landscape (MIEL)&quot;, and the imaging is solely based on texture features of four immunolabeled epigenetic marks. However, the texture of those histone modifications can be correlated to the general structure and texture of the DNA. The authors exclude compounds that lead to a cell count &gt; 50 nuclei/ well, however, if a compound induces significant apoptosis with ~50% cell death, the texture features could pick up chromatin condensation and thereby potentially generate false-positive hits.</p></disp-quote><p>As suggested by the reviewer, karyopyknosis is a major concern that would inevitably have a detrimental effect on the staining texture. Fortunately, pyknotic nuclei are very distinct from normal nuclei, even at early stages of pyknosis, and can be easily excluded from the analysis during the nuclei segmentation stage (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="respfig1">Author response image1</xref>; red arrow showing unsegmented pyknotic nucleus).</p><fig id="respfig1"><label>Author response image 1.</label><caption><title>Image of DAPI-stained mouse hepatocytes showing segmentation of normal healthy nuclei (green arrows), but not of pyknotic or pre-pyknotic nuclei (red arrow).</title></caption><graphic mime-subtype="tiff" mimetype="image" xlink:href="elife-49683-resp-fig1-v2.tif"/></fig><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>It would be helpful to see if there is a correlation between nuclei count and MIEL z-scores.</p></disp-quote><p>We agree with the reviewer that it is important to identify a possible correlation between drug toxicity (cell count) and magnitude of the effect (z-scored Euclidean distance) because it may suggest that cell stress is a major contributor to the staining textures analyzed by MIEL. We explored this question in the manuscript (Figure 2B) where we report that: “… some compound classes, such as Aurora and JAK inhibitors, induce epigenetic alterations only in concentrations at which the cell count is significantly reduced, whether through toxicity or a direct effect on proliferation (original Figure 2B, dark blue and pink, respectively), while other compounds, such as HDAC inhibitors, characteristically induce epigenetic alterations at concentrations that are not accompanied by reduced cell counts (green and yellow). Interestingly, inhibitors of both SIRT and EZH1/2 (light blue and red, respectively) induced significant epigenetic changes without significantly affecting cell count.”</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Furthermore, the authors claim that they can use MIEL to analyse dose-dependent effects from drug treatment. Yet, in light of the concern above, they cannot be sure whether they detect the pharmacological effect or a toxic effect that is not related to epigenetic changes.</p></disp-quote><p>The reviewer’s concerns are fully justified. However, as shown above, some drug classes (e.g., EZH1/2 inhibitors) can induce epigenetic changes without toxicity. In addition, we offer <xref ref-type="fig" rid="respfig2">Author response image 2</xref>,which shows a distance map of GBM2 cells treated with DMSO or HDAC inhibitors at multiple concentrations (the size of each node is proportional to the cell count of each population). Treatments that reduced cell counts are partial ‘outliers’ compared with the center of the HDAC ‘cloud’ (green arrows), and a significant reduction in cell count (&lt;50) tends to shift the compound completely away from the cloud (red arrow) <xref ref-type="fig" rid="respfig2">Author response image 2</xref>. This observation further suggests that, while toxicity and cell stress play a role in shaping the epigenetic landscape, the staining texture remains sufficiently robust to correctly classify the treatment by drug function, at least up to a point.</p><fig id="respfig2"><label>Author response image 2.</label><caption><title>Distance map depicting the relative Euclidean distance between the multiparametric centroids of GBM2 cells treated with DMSO (88 replicates) or pan HDAC inhibitors (7 compounds; average or 2 replicates shown).</title><p>Compounds were present at 0.3, 1, 3, 10, and 30 μM.

The distance map shows wide scattering of the various conditions leading to cell death (red). Our interpretation of this finding is that treatments that induce cell death do not converge to form a distinctive staining texture. This may be because the texture of dying cells is greatly influenced by both cell death-related processes and the mechanism of action of the toxic drug. In the future studies, it will be informative to compare the effect of drugs that are known to specifically induce apoptosis, necrosis, paraptosis, and other forms of cell death to further elucidate this question.</p><fig id="respfig3"><label>Author response image 3.</label><caption><title>Distance map depicting the relative Euclidean distance between the multiparametric centroids of GBM2 cells treated with DMSO or 85 active compounds (3 technical replicates per compound; 91 DMSO replicates).</title><p>Distances calculated using texture features derived from images of cells stained for H3K9me3, H3K27me3, H3K4me1, and H3K27ac.</p></caption><graphic mime-subtype="tiff" mimetype="image" xlink:href="elife-49683-resp-fig3-v2.tif"/></fig><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>2) The second major concern is that, for many of the analyses it seems almost irrelevant whether all four histone modifications are taken into account, or just either of the two pairs, or just one of the four marks.

Using DAPI and H3 texture, is it then also possible to discriminate between the compounds?</p></disp-quote><p>We thank the reviewer for his/her valuable contribution. We have previously examined the texture of DAPI-stained cells and found that DNA labeling can partially recapitulate the staining pattern of H3K9me3, which labels constitutive heterochromatin (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="respfig4">Author response image 4A</xref>; image processed to highlight the similarities). We have also conducted the analysis suggested by the reviewer and found that DAPI staining provided an overall classification accuracy of 65.6% (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="respfig4">Author response image 4B</xref>) compared with 86.4% provided by H3K9me3 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="respfig4">Author response image 4C</xref>). However, despite the reduced overall accuracy, it is evident that DAPI staining may be an informative and cheap alternative to histone staining in at least some applications when the analyzed epigenetic landscape are very distinct. This analysis has been added to Figure 1—figure supplement 3B together with accompanying text in the Results section.</p><fig id="respfig4"><label>Author response image 4.</label><caption><title>DAPI images can be used for MIEL analysis.</title><p>(<bold>A</bold>) Image of DAPI-stained GBM2 cells demonstrating the similarities in DAPI and H3K9me3 staining (contrast and brightness adjusted to highlight similarity of stain).

ATAC sequencing after treatment with and without representative compounds of the drug screen should provide biological evidence for the phenotypic results of the image analysis.</p></disp-quote><p>As suggested by the reviewer, it is very likely that information obtained by MIEL on the epigenetic landscape is at least partly influenced by both the organization of chromatin and the pattern of histone modifications. Although we found that one histone modification was as good as another for both the detection and classification of many treatments, this was not always the case. Perhaps the most obvious example is H3K27me3, which is relatively poor at function-based classification for all epigenetic drugs except EZH1/2 inhibitors, for which it yielded the highest classification accuracy of all modifications (Figure 1—figure supplement 3B of the manuscript). We believe that this is due to the direct role of EZH1/2 in the methylation of Lys27 of Histone 3.</p><p>We agree with the reviewer that ATAC-seq may add another layer of confidence to our results. We believe, however, that changes in overall staining intensity for various histone modifications (Figure 1—figure supplement 2B) together with changes in the transcriptomic program (validated using RNA-seq) are sufficiently strong to establish that epigenetic changes do indeed occur following drug, serum, or Bmp4 treatment.</p></body></sub-article></article>
