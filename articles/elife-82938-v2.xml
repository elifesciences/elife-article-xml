We generated MHC class I and II transgenic reporter mice to define their dynamics in response to inflammatory demyelination, providing a means to monitor MHC activation in diverse cell types in living mice and define their roles in aging, injury, and disease.</p></abstract><abstract abstract-type="plain-language-summary"><title>eLife digest</title><p>Nerve cells in the brain and spinal cord are surrounded by a layer of insulation called myelin that allows cells to transmit messages to each other more quickly and efficiently. This protective sheath is produced by cells called oligodendrocytes which together with their immature counterparts can also repair damage caused to myelin.</p><p>In the inflammatory disease multiple sclerosis (MS), this insulation is disrupted and oligodendroglia fail to repair breaks in the myelin sheath, leaving nerves vulnerable to further damage. Recently it was discovered that mature and immature oligodendrocytes (which are collectively known as oligodendroglia) sometimes express proteins normally restricted to the immune system called major histocompatibility complexes (or MHCs for short). Researchers believe that MHC expression may allow oligodendroglia to interact with immune cells, potentially leading to the removal of oligodendroglia by the immune system as well as inflammation that exacerbates damage to nerves and hinders myelin repair.</p><p>Knowing when oligodendroglia start producing MHCs and where these MHC-expressing cells are located is therefore important for understanding their role in MS. However, it is difficult to identify the location of MHC-expressing oligodendroglia using methods that are currently available. To address this, Harrington, Catenacci et al. created a genetically engineered mouse model in which the MHC-expressing oligodendroglia also generated a red fluorescent protein that could be detected under a microscope. This revealed that only a small number of oligodendroglia in the nervous system had MHCs, but these cells were located in areas of the brain and spinal cord with the highest inflammatory activity.</p><p>Further microscopy studies in mice that developed MS-like symptoms revealed that MHC production in oligodendroglia increased compared with healthy animals, and that the proportion of oligodendroglia that produced MHC was highest in mice with the most severe symptoms. MHC-expressing oligodendroglia also congregated in the most damaged areas of the brain and spinal cord.</p><p>These results suggest that MHC expression may contribute to inflammation and impact the function of oligodendroglia that have these molecules. In the future, Harrington et al. hope that their new mouse model will help researchers study the role of MHC expression in different diseases, and in the case of MS, aid the development of new treatments.</p></abstract><kwd-group kwd-group-type="author-keywords"><kwd>multiple sclerosis</kwd><kwd>oligodendrocytes</kwd><kwd>major histocompatibility complex</kwd></kwd-group><kwd-group kwd-group-type="research-organism"><title>Research organism</title><kwd>Mouse</kwd></kwd-group><funding-group><award-group id="fund1"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000002</institution-id><institution>National Institutes of Health</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>NIA AG072305</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Bergles</surname><given-names>Dwight E</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund2"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000890</institution-id><institution>National Multiple Sclerosis Society</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>FAN-1707-28857</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Harrington</surname><given-names>Em P</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund3"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution>Dr. Miriam and Sheldon G Adelson Medical Research Foundation</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Bergles</surname><given-names>Dwight E</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund4"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000001</institution-id><institution>National Science Foundation</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Catenacci</surname><given-names>Riley B</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund5"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000002</institution-id><institution>National Institutes of Health</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>R01 NS041435</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Calabresi</surname><given-names>Peter A</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><funding-statement>The funders had no role in study design, data collection and interpretation, or the decision to submit the work for publication.</funding-statement></funding-group><custom-meta-group><custom-meta specific-use="meta-only"><meta-name>Author impact statement</meta-name><meta-value>Oligodendroglia express major histocompatibility complex (MHC) pathways in response to inflammation and MHC reporter mice allow for the investigation of MHC molecule expressing cells in vivo.</meta-value></custom-meta></custom-meta-group></article-meta></front><body><sec id="s1" sec-type="intro"><title>Introduction</title><p>Single-cell and single-nucleus RNA sequencing has revealed that some oligodendroglia in both mouse inflammatory models (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Falcão et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Meijer et al., 2022</xref>) and human multiple sclerosis (MS) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">Schirmer et al., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Jäkel et al., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Absinta et al., 2021</xref>) express transcripts associated with major histocompatibility complex (MHC) antigen presenting and processing pathways.

The role of these immune oligodendroglia is unknown (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Harrington et al., 2020</xref>), but their presence raises the possibility that oligodendroglia may present antigens to T cells, be subject to cytotoxic CD8 T cell-mediated death (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Kirby et al., 2019</xref>) and perpetuate the immune response through release of cytokines and interactions with CD4 T cells. This oligodendroglial death or inflammation could contribute to impaired remyelination seen in MS and other progressive diseases (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Lubetzki et al., 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Mahad et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Lassmann et al., 2012</xref>). Further exploration of the spatial and temporal dynamics of iOPCs/iOLs have been limited by their relative rarity and our inability to identify which cells have transformed in living tissue. To enable detection of which cells upregulate MHC pathways in vivo, we generated two novel MHC I and MHC II reporter mouse lines that express tdTomato when these pathways are activated, and used these lines to define their incidence and transcriptional characteristics in two mouse models of inflammatory demyelination.</p></sec><sec id="s2" sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><sec id="s2-1"><title>MHC reporter mice are a reliable readout of MHC protein expression</title><p>MHC class II chaperone invariant chain (Cd74 or Ii) and MHC class I component beta-2-microglobulin (B2m) are required components of the antigen processing/presentation machinery that are expressed by a subset of oligodendroglia in mouse inflammatory models (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Falcão et al., 2018</xref>) and human MS brain (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">Schirmer et al., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Jäkel et al., 2019</xref>).

One mature Falcao et al. subset, MOL3_EAE, was under-represented in our dataset, which may reflect differences in spinal cord oligodendroglia compared to brain oligodendroglia. One of our subclusters, 1-OL_homeo, corresponded to primarily oligodendroglia enriched in naïve non-immunized mice from Falcao et al. dataset, which may represent homeostatic oligodendrocytes with low levels of MHC class I, MHC class II, and cell stress/apoptosis transcripts (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig10">Figure 10C–H</xref>). We selected upregulated transcripts from each oligodendroglial subcluster of our dataset (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="fig10sdata1">Figure 10—source data 1</xref>) and evaluated expression of these transcripts in corresponding subclusters in Falcao et al. dataset (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig11">Figure 11C</xref>). Transcripts highly expressed in our oligodendroglial subclusters demonstrated high expression in Falcao et al. subclusters, based on UMAP location.

To overcome this limitation, we developed two new mouse lines in which the fluorescent protein tdT is expressed under control of either the <italic>B2m</italic> or <italic>Cd74</italic> promoters, allowing identification of cells that upregulate MHC I and MHC II pathways, respectively. Our studies reveal that MHC class I and II reporter mice enable reliable detection of immune oligodendroglia in the CNS. Quantitative analysis from naïve and inflammatory disease model mice reveals that these glial cells represent a small, but diverse population that increase in the inflammatory environment, mirroring single-nucleus RNA sequencing results from human MS post-mortem tissues (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">Schirmer et al., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Jäkel et al., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Absinta et al., 2021</xref>). Although not restricted to lesion sites, immune oligodendroglia were more prevalent in areas of enhanced inflammation specific to disease pathology, where they have the potential to influence the behavior of both peripheral and central immune cells and subsequent remyelination. Future, longitudinal intravital imaging of <italic>Cd74<sup>tdT</sup></italic> and <italic>B2m<sup>tdT</sup></italic> mice will help to define the onset and persistence of MHC activation in these cells and determine if they are at higher risk for removal from the CNS through cytotoxic CD8 T cell-induced death.</p><p>Recent evidence suggests that MHC expression may vary with age (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">Nemes-Baran et al., 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">de la Fuente et al., 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Mishra et al., 2020</xref>), and our scRNA-seq data revealed that a subset of MHC class I expressing oligodendroglia express <italic>PD-L1/Cd274</italic> transcripts, which may protect these cells from CD8 T cell-mediated death and may allow MHC class I oligodendroglia to persist in inflammatory settings. Whether these oligodendroglia exhibit impaired differentiation and capacity for remyelination remains to be determined. Conversely, oligodendroglia expressing MHC class II may be more prone to apoptosis or senescence through Gadd45b signaling (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib45">Zaidi and Liebermann, 2022</xref>). Moreover, the frequency of immune oligodendroglia was correlated with disease severity, suggesting that these cells have a relationship with behavioral presentation that could be used to track the progression and treatment of demyelinating disease. The ability to isolate immune oligodendroglia and other cells with activated MHC pathways from the CNS will help define the phenotypic changes they exhibit in diverse disease and injury contexts, and provide new insight into the complex cellular interactions that modify disease progression and repair.</p><p>The value of these MHC reporter mice extends beyond OL lineage cells. Reactive microglia and astroglia can also express MHC class II and have been implicated in many neurodegenerative diseases. <italic>Cd74</italic> is a signature of disease-associated microglia in Alzheimer’s (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Bryan et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib44">Swanson et al., 2020</xref>), as well as being found in microglia associated with MS in post-mortem tissues (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Absinta et al., 2021</xref>). Delineation of the transcriptional profiles of these cells can now be achieved by sorting tdT+ microglia, and their regional dynamics defined through in vivo two-photon imaging.

Three <italic>B2m<sup>tdT</sup></italic> were immunized with MOG<sub>35-55</sub> peptide and sacrificed at 15 dpi with clinical scores ranging 2.5–3. Four <italic>Cd74<sup>tdT</sup></italic> animals were immunized with MOG<sub>35-55</sub> peptide and sacrificed at 12 dpi with clinical scores ranging 1.5–4 for one experiment and separate experiment three <italic>Cd74<sup>tdT</sup></italic> animals were immunized with MOG<sub>35-55</sub> peptide and sacrificed at 13 dpi with clinical scores ranging 3–3.5. Non-immunized adult <italic>B2m<sup>tdT</sup></italic> (n=9) and <italic>Cd74<sup>tdT</sup></italic> animals (n=6) were sacrificed for baseline tissue for these experiments in parallel with EAE animals and as one separate experiment of baseline alone. Animals were anesthetized with isoflurane and intracardially perfused with cold HBSS. Spleens were dissected and dissociated by mashing over 100 µm filter and red blood cells were lysed using RBC lysis buffer (BioLegend 420301). Brain and spinal cords were dissected, cut with razor sagittally for two dissociations per animal, lightly chopped several times with fine razor, and transferred to pre-equilibrated enzyme solution at 37°C. Two separate dissociations with papain/DNase and collagenase/DNase were performed for each sagittal half of the brain and spinal cord. Concentrations of enzymes: papain 20 U/ml (Worthington LS003119), collagenase IV 1 mg/ml (Worthington LS004188) and DNase 100 U/ml (Worthington LS002007). Papain buffer: EBSS (Sigma E7510), 22.5 mM D-glucose, 0.5 mM EDTA, 2.2 g/L NaHCO<sub>3</sub>, 5.5 mM L-cysteine pH 7.4. Collagenase buffer: EBSS, 22.5 mM D-glucose, 2.2 g/L NaHCO<sub>3</sub>, 3 mM CaCl<sub>2</sub> pH 7.4. Tissue dissociations were incubated at 37°C for 10 min followed by mechanical dissociation 10× with 1 ml pipette tip (first time with tip cut to larger bore) and repeated for a total of three incubations/triturations. Cell dissociations were filtered over a 70 µm filter, washed with PBS and myelin was removed with debris removal solution (Miltenyi 130-109-398) according to the manufacturer’s protocol. Lower cell suspension layer was washed with PBS, filtered over FACS tube with 35 µm filter, incubated for 15 min with Fc block (BioLegend 156604) and live/dead Aqua (Thermo Fisher L34966) for spleen samples, washed with FACs buffer and incubated with cell surface antibodies at concentration of 1:100 in FACs buffer for 30 min. Cell surface antibodies: CD45 APCFire 750 (BioLegend 103211), Ly6G bv650 (BioLegend 127641), CD19 PacBlue (BioLegend 115523), CD11b PerCPCy5.5 (BioLegend 101228), CD11c PECy7 (BioLegend 117318), Clec12a APC (BioLegend 143406), CD86 bv421 (BioLegend 105035), CD40 FITC (BioLegend 124608), CD206 bv711 (BioLegend 141727), IA/IE bv785 (BioLegend 107645), CD3 PerCPCy5.5 (BioLegend 317336), CD8 PECy7 (BioLegend 100722), CD4 APC (BD 553051). For B2m staining, rabbit B2m 1:10 (Agilent A0072) primary was added to surface stain, and three washes were performed prior to secondary antibody staining with anti-rabbit bv421 1:500 (BioLegend 406410) with three additional washes after secondary antibody. For CD74 staining after surface stain, cells were fixed with IC fix (eBioscience88-8824-00) for 30 min followed by incubation with CD74 FITC 1:100 (BD 561941) in permeabilization buffer (eBioscience88-8824-00) for 30 min according to the manufacturer’s protocol. Cells were washed in FACS buffer and ran on Cytek Aurora 4 laser (VBYR) flow cytometer in Johns Hopkins Ross Flow Cytometry Core. Compensation was performed with single stained UltraComp eBeads (ThermoScientific 01-3333-42), ArC amine reactive beads for viability dyes (LifeTechnologies A10346) and unstained wild-type dissociated spleen, brain and spinal cord for tdT compensation. FlowJo software was used for analysis and gating. Spleen was gated on singlet, cell, viable, CD45+, Ly6G- then further subgated on CD19+ (B cells), CD11b+ (monocytes), CD11b-CD11c+ (dendritic cells). For brain and spinal cord EAE cells were gated on singlets, cell, CD45+CD11b+ and then further subgated on Clec12a+ vs Clec12a-. Both Clec12a+ (infiltrating myeloid) and Clec12a- (microglia) were gated on co-stimulatory molecule CD40 and CD86 expression. Collagenase and papain dissociations were compared without any notable differences and dissociations with the highest yield of cells of interest were presented (collagenase for <italic>Cd74<sup>tdT</sup></italic> infiltrating myeloid cells and microglia and papain for <italic>B2m<sup>tdT</sup></italic> microglia). Tissue from each animal was stained and analyzed separately for each biological replicate. Multiple flow staining panels were performed on biological replicate and the most informative panels were used for data analysis.</p></sec><sec id="s4-11"><title>Single-cell RNA sequencing</title><p>For single-cell experiments two separate experiments were performed, one for each reporter line.

Animals were anesthetized with isoflurane and intracardially perfused with cold HBSS without cations with 5 µg/ml actinomycin (Sigma A1410) and 10 µM triptolide (Sigma T3652). Brains and spinal cords were dissected and placed in six-well plate with cold dissection buffer (HBSS no cations with 5 µg/ml actinomycin, 10 µM triptolide, and 27 µg/ml anisomycin [Sigma A9789]) protected from light. Brains and spinal cords were lightly chopped several times with fine razor and transferred to pre-equilibrated at 37°C dissociation buffer with enzymes (papain 20 U/ml and DNase 100 U/ml with 5 µg/ml actinomycin, 10 µM triptolide, and 27 µg/ml anisomycin in EBSS, 22.5 mM D-glucose, 0.5 mM EDTA, 2.2 g/l NaHCO<sub>3</sub>, 5.5 mM L-cysteine pH 7.4).

Cell dissociations were filtered over a 70 µm filter, washed with PBS and myelin was removed with two rounds of debris removal solution (Miltenyi 130-109-398) according to the manufacturer’s protocol. Cell pellet was resuspended in PBS and filtered over FACS tube with 35 µm filter and incubated with Zombie live/dead Violet (BioLegend 423114) for 15 min in cold PBS at 4°C, washed in cold PBS and resuspended in 0.5% BSA 1 mM EDTA PBS at concentration of 1×10<sup>6</sup> cells/ml in cold PBS on ice for single-cell sorting. For <italic>Cd74<sup>tdT</sup></italic> samples, two animals were pooled for two sorts. For <italic>B2m<sup>tdT</sup></italic> samples, all three samples were combined then divided into two tubes and only one tube was sorted. Only brain samples were sorted due to the level of myelin debris in spinal cord samples. Brain samples were sorted on Aria Ilu 3 laser (VBR) in Johns Hopkins Ross Flow Cytometry core and gated on scatter and viability. tdT-positive and tdT-negative populations were collected in 0.1% BSA PBS on ice. Samples were sorted for a limit of 2 hr before submission to Johns Hopkins sequencing core. Cell viability and concentration was checked on a Countess II automated hemocytometer using Trypan Blue (Life Technologies) exclusion. Cell volumes calculated to capture 10,000 cells were loaded into a Chromium Next GEM Chip G and GEMs (Gel Bead-in-emulsion) were generated using a Chromium Controller using Single Cell 3’ v3 chemistry (10× Genomics). Barcoded single-cell libraries were then generated according to the manufacturer’s recommendations.

Filtered features from cellranger were imported into R (v4.1.2) using Seurat (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">Satija et al., 2015</xref>) (v4.1.0). Additional per cell metrics were assessed including gene count, UMI count, and ratio of reads mapping to mitochondrial genes. Cells were excluded for gene and UMI counts using adaptive thresholds (±3 median absolute deviations) with scuttle (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">McCarthy et al., 2017</xref>) (v1.4.0) or for mitochondrial gene ratios greater than 10%. The <italic>Cd74<sup>tdT</sup></italic> tdT-positive sorted dataset had 8307 cells with median gene count per cell of 2839 (2122,3478), median UMI count per cell of 11,400 (6522,16856), and median mitochondrial ratio of 3.149% (2.356%,4.196%) before filtering and 7968 cells with median gene count per cell of 2895 (2210,3508), median UMI count per cell of 11848 (6990,17132) and median mitochondrial ratio of 3.105% (2.333%,4.061%) after filtering.

The <italic>Cd74<sup>tdT</sup></italic> tdT-negative sorted and <italic>Cd74<sup>tdT</sup></italic> tdT-positive sorted datasets were then merged into a single object prior to data normalization. For clustering purposes, UMI counts were normalized with a regularized negative binomial regression via the SCTransform function in Seurat (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Hafemeister and Satija, 2019</xref>) using the glmGamPoi method (v1.6.0) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Ahlmann-Eltze and Huber, 2021</xref>). This was followed by principal component analysis (PCA) dimensionality reduction followed by UMAP dimensionality reduction on the first 40 principal components. Clustering was performed by creating a shared nearest-neighbor graph using the first 40 principal components followed by Louvain clustering. Cluster annotation was done in an automated fashion with SingleR (v1.8.1) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Aran et al., 2019</xref>) against the MouseRNASeqData set of 358 mouse bulk RNA-seq samples from sorted populations (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Benayoun et al., 2019</xref>) available in the celldex package (v1.4.0). Automated annotations were then checked manually by comparing against well-characterized reference genes. For purposes of expression visualization (violin plots, feature plots), UMI counts were log normalized with Seurat. For heatmaps, normalized UMI counts were scaled with Seurat’s ScaleData function. Subclustering analysis was performed by subsetting the cells of interest from the larger dataset (oligodendrocytes from merged <italic>Cd74<sup>tdT</sup></italic> tdT-positive sorted and <italic>Cd74<sup>tdT</sup></italic> tdT-negative sorted dataset, or oligodendrocyte cluster 5 from the olidogendrocyte dataset) and repeating above analysis on just the subsetted cells.</p></sec><sec id="s4-13"><title>Data integration and comparison</title><p>Raw counts for the previously published dataset by <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Falcão et al., 2018</xref>, were retrieved from the Gene Expression Omnibus under accession GSE113973.

Your article has been reviewed by 3 peer reviewers, and the evaluation has been overseen by a Reviewing Editor and Carla Rothlin as the Senior Editor. The following individuals involved in the review of your submission have agreed to reveal their identity: Goncalo Castelo-Branco (Reviewer #1); Tim Vartanian (Reviewer #3).</p><p>The reviewers have discussed their reviews with one another, and the Reviewing Editor has drafted this to help you prepare a revised submission.</p><p>Essential revisions:</p><p>1. The authors should explain the rationale for selecting B2m and Cd74, instead of other genes involved in these pathways.</p><p>2. MHC I has been traditionally described as expressed in all nucleated cells (https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC1783040/), although recent single-cell RNA-Seq studies suggest that this might not be the case. The data presented by the authors suggest that indeed activation of MHC I expression might be restricted, and it would be good if the authors discuss this aspect in relation to the current literature.</p><p>3. In Figure 1c, the difference observed in CD74-TdT is of much lower magnitude than B2m-TdT, could the authors comment on the reason why they think this is the case?</p><p>4. Line 162 – &quot;B2m transcripts are upregulated in Cux2 expressing cortical layer II/II pyramidal neurons in human MS, which are susceptible to neurodegeneration3. Expression of MHC class I by these neurons may allow them to present antigen and render them more prone to death in inflammatory conditions.&quot; This is most likely referring to Supplementary Figure 4j, but no Cux2 staining to identify this cortical layer is provided. Also, it should be cortical layer II/III, not cortical layer II/II.</p><p>5. The authors perform several quantifications of the lesion and non-lesion areas, but only mention DAPI hypercellularity to define a lesion, more details should be provided. Also, how many lesions were quantified per mouse, and which regions of the brain and spinal cord? Also, whenever the authors present a high-magnification view of lesions (e.g. Figure 2), it would be good to present a lower magnification image of the same region, to orient the reader.</p><p>6. While the authors present a supplementary video to confirm the colocalization of TdT and oligodendrocyte markers, it would be good to present Z-stacks of the images in Figure 2c. Also, the authors should describe in the methods the parameters by which they define which cells are double positive.</p><p>7. The authors find that the % of TdT+ Olig2+ cells out of Olig2+ cells was around 0.6% in the spinal cord, while Falcao and colleagues (Nature Medicine 2018) found this percentage to be 3-4%. The authors can discuss possible reasons for these differences.</p><p>8. In line 222 and Figure 2F, the authors indicate that the number of OPCs expressing TdT is much lower than CC1+ positive cells. It would be interesting to discuss why this might be the case and the possible implications of this difference.</p><p>9. Figure 2I-J – The differences observed are borderline significant and very variable between lesions and non-lesions. Also in J, representative images are shown from different EAE scores.</p><p>10. Given that most of the EAE pathology occurs in the spinal cord, it is surprising that the authors present their single-cell studies with brain samples. In the Material and Methods, the spinal cord is also mentioned, with challenges in the sample preparation. The authors can integrate their dataset with other similar EAE datasets (Falcao et al., Nature Medicine 2018, Wheeler et al., Nature 2020) to compare the properties of the MHC1+ and/ or MHC2+ oligodendroglia (and astrocytes) they identify with the immune oligodendroglia and altered astrocytes in these datasets. Also, while the purpose of the single-cell experiment is to confirm the transcriptional identity of the TdT cells, which the authors succeed to do, it appears that n=1, and additional biological replicates would be recommended.</p><p>11. From Figure 3G and 3K, it appears that cluster 5 can be subclustered in 2 subpopulations, have the authors attempted to perform further subclustering?</p><p>12. The authors mention in the methods the redundancy in the TdT sequencing. Did this constitute a problem for the detection of the TdT transcripts in the single-cell analysis?</p><p>13. No code for the single-cell RNA-Seq analysis is provided and more information regarding QC (number of UMIs, % mitochondrial genes, etc) should be included.</p><p>14. Many of the images have low resolution and are thus difficult to examine. In particular, Figure 1 would benefit of higher resolution images for instance at the lesion areas, so the reader can observe the labelling in individual cells.</p><p>15. Figure 3—figure supplement 3 is completely missing.</p><p>16. Figure 3—figure supplement 4 – can the authors show the expression of additional oligodendrocytes markers, such as PLP1, CNP, Mog, Mag, and transcription factors as Olig1 and Olig2, to further assess which type of transcripts are contaminating/being phagocytized by non-oligodendroglial cells.</p><p>17. In Figure and Supplementary Figure legends, please state the n for each experiment shown and how many times the experiment was replicated.</p><p>18. The Material and Methods part regarding animals should include much more detail and follow the ARRIVE guidelines as much as possible. Please clarify the methods for the flow experiments described in 1 C-E. Was there an analysis of myelin?</p><p>19. In general, the manuscript is difficult to navigate, with much of the information in supplementary figures. We would recommend the authors reorganize the manuscript text and figures accordingly.</p><p>20. The presence of the 2A self-cleaving peptide should be highlighted when describing the reporter genes so that the reader can better understand reporter expression from the constructs.</p><p>21. The authors demonstrate the presence of the reporter fusion proteins on Western blot. Does the tomato portion need to be released from the fusion to provide fluorescence or is the presence of the fusion sufficient?</p><p>22. B2m and CD74 are necessary for cell surface expression of class I and II, respectively. Do the fusions influence (disrupt) cell surface class I or class II expression in reporter mice?</p><p>23. Some comment on astrocyte expression, or lack thereof, of the reporters in the inflammatory models examined would be of interest.</p><p>24. The mouse models report on class I and class II expression, which in turn report on the presence of inflammatory cytokines, particularly IFN-γ. Please comment on the spatial distribution of reporter-expressing cells in the CNS of their inflammatory models relative to the location of the immune cell infiltrates. This would provide some insight into the diffusion of the inflammatory cytokines away from the infiltrates.</p><p>25. Figure 1, please show boxed regions of interest for the merged images shown below F and G at high power so we can decern at a minimum leptomeninges from parenchyma and overlapping from non-overlapping fluorescence (probably ventrolateral cord).</p><p>26. The ventral brain/meningeal cluster would be better emphasized as a separate figure devoted to the brain.</p><p>27. It would be nice to show it in conjunction with the expression of CD74-TdT and B2m-TdT. Is the meningeal CD74-TdT expression in Figure 1 Supp 3F (baseline) more extensive than in Figure 1F (EAE score 0)?</p><p>28. In Figure 1 supp 4, B2m-TdT expression seems extensive in the cortex (more than just layer 2) and in the corpus callosum.</p><p>29. Are B2m-TdT and NeuN non-overlapping in the cortex (1 supp 4J)? If so, what lineage is B2m-TdT positive in 4J? What cell types are accounting for the intense B2m-TdT signal in the corpus callosum at baseline? What is the nature of the spindle-shaped cells that are Iba1 negative, B2m-TdT positive in the spinal cord (Figure 1 supp 4E)? What is the cell type in the CD74-TdT meningeal clusters in the brain (1I)?</p><p>30. In Figure 2, please provide the HPF of the B2m-TdT glial culture with IFNγ (2A). The TdT signal in 2B seems highly polarized relative to olig2 – is this a consistent finding? For 2C, it would be helpful to see the olig2 (green) unmerged images. Does the quantitation of TdT+/Olig2+ cells in the EAE spinal cord (2D) refer to total spinal cord or lesions? Similarly, for 2H, is this quantification lesion-based or total cord? How were ROI's determined for the quantitative data in Figure 2 (Please include this in the methods)? For 2F please make it somehow clearer that the y-axis is PDGFR (-).</p><p>31. Why was the brain used for the scRNA seq in Figure 3 as opposed to the spinal cord? Was this analysis done on samples at a particular EAE stage? In the results text can you either cite or explain bias based on the efficiency of generating viable single cells for different cell populations? Similarly, would the immune-oligodendroglial cluster potentially be less viable since it is already considered stressed and thus the relative size underestimated? How do the oligodendrocyte subclusters differ by CD74-TdT expression?</p><p>32. The discussion on the highest MHC I expressing oligodendrocyte subcluster is very interesting (proteosome, PD-L1) and I would recommend expanding this discussion since this cluster is the focus of the paper.</p><p>33. In the heat map (3K) I'm trying to understand what the individual vertical bars for a particular cluster and class II gene represent? Technical replicates? Experimental replicates? Perhaps p values are needed?</p><p><italic>Reviewer #1 (Recommendations for the authors):</italic></p><p>The manuscript is acceptable for publication in <italic>eLife</italic>, although there are several points the authors will need to address:</p><p>– The authors should explain the rationale for selecting B2m and Cd74, instead of other genes involved in these pathways.</p><p>– MHC I has been traditionally described to be expressed in all nucleated cells (https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC1783040/), although recent single-cell RNA-Seq studies suggest that this might not be the case.

The authors should explain the rationale for selecting B2m and Cd74, instead of other genes involved in these pathways.</p></disp-quote><p>We chose these MHC associated genes due to previous lines of evidence from in vitro OPC culture, in vivo mouse models, and human MS tissue that these transcripts are upregulated in oligodendroglia in response to inflammation, and because the degree of upregulation of transcript activity from minimal expression at baseline to much higher expression levels in the setting of inflammation was desirable for signal to noise. <italic>B2m</italic> was also chosen as a readout for both classical and non-classical MHC class I activity; <italic>Cd74</italic> is complementary, as the MHC class II invariant chain. We have added additional text (line 66) to indicate the rationale for choosing these genes for reporter generation.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>2. MHC I has been traditionally described as expressed in all nucleated cells (https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC1783040/), although recent single-cell RNA-Seq studies suggest that this might not be the case.

While all nucleated cells express MHC I, it has been known for some time that specific cells can increase MHC expression in response to viral infection or inflammatory stimuli especially IFNγ. A major impetus for making the MHC reporter mice was recent observations in human postmortem MS tissue and in EAE that subsets of glia, most notably oligodendrocyte lineage cells, had expression of MHC I, which may allow them to propagate CNS immune responses, but also then be targeted by CD8 T cells for cytotoxic cell death. This finding has implications for understanding why remyelination fails and why in some MS cases there is a paucity of OPCs. As with most advances in science, the observation is not entirely novel and there are data supporting enhanced MHC expression on oligodendrocyte lineage cells in response to sterile inflammation going back more than ten years, but the confluence of recent papers reporting this in MS tissues and the EAE model using single nucleus RNAseq has garnered widespread interest in the neuroscience community. We have added further discussion regarding this topic and the potential for neuronal MHC expression in the revised manuscript Line 332.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>3.

Cd74 and MHC class II expression at baseline is only present in small populations of blood circulating immune cells. The flow histogram is indicating tdT expression in all CD45+ cells in the peripheral blood and there is a large population of tdT-negative cells in peripheral blood. Blood phenotyping was used in conjunction with PCR genotyping to identify reporter mice.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>4.

In MOG35-55 EAE, the average %tdT+Olig2+ was 6% for <italic>B2m<sup>tdT</sup></italic> and 0.6% for <italic>Cd74<sup>tdT</sup></italic> in the spinal cord, and 6% for <italic>B2m<sup>tdT</sup></italic> and 0.5% for <italic>Cd74<sup>tdT</sup></italic> in the brain. For our EAE analysis we included animals that ranged from clinical score 1.5-3.5, which allowed our study to determine if higher clinical scores were correlated more MHC+ oligodendroglia, which is what we found on an individual animal level both with clinical scores and tdT+ intensity in ROIs as an overall readout of inflammatory activity. The percentage of MHC+ oligodendroglia ranged from 1-17% in <italic>B2m<sup>TdT</sup></italic> and 0.1-1.4% in <italic>Cd74<sup>tdT</sup></italic> EAE spinal cord. Models with high degrees of inflammatory infiltrate in the corpus callosum (AT-CUP) had higher percentages of tdT+Olig2+ cells, with a mean of 17% (range 3-34%) in <italic>B2m<sup>TdT</sup></italic> and 1% (range 0.2-3.8%) in <italic>Cd74<sup>tdT</sup></italic> AT-CUP brain. Thus, we found similar percentages to prior studies in animals with higher clinical scores and the degree of inflammatory activity on an individual animal basis correlated with MHC+ oligodendroglia across animals. We have also included brain regional breakdown, which revealed a higher percentage of MHC+ oligodendroglia in areas of higher inflammatory infiltrates in respective models: Figure 8—figure supplement 1B-D.</p><p>It is likely that the percentage of MHC+ oligodendroglia can differ when comparing quantification from different techniques, such as IHC staining and cells isolated for single-cell RNA sequencing. Tissue dissociation and steps involved in isolating cells from CNS tissue may introduce biases in quantification. When sorting tdT-positive cells from <italic>CD74<sup>tdT</sup></italic> EAE brain, 3% of subclustered oligodendroglia were from the MHC class II <italic>Cd74<sup>tdT</sup></italic> tdT+ sorted population, compared to a mean of 0.5% quantification from the EAE brain regional analysis; however, this varied on an individual animal basis and also by brain region. Quantification of MHC+ oligodendroglia previously published by Falcao et al. was based on mRNA transcript level and not protein or reporter expression, which could contribute to the differences in proportion of MHC expressing oligodendroglia.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>8.

We expanded the tissue quantified to include baseline, pre-symptomatic and symptomatic EAE tissue to determine if there is a loss of MHC+ OPCs with higher inflammatory activity and added this quantification to Figure 7J and Figure 7—figure supplement 1B-D. We found similar percentages of MHC+ OPCs across these conditions and did not find a correlation between the %PDGFRa+tdT+ cells and clinical score, overall %tdT+Olig2+ cells, or mean tdT intensity, suggesting there may not be a loss of MHC+ OPCs with higher inflammatory activity at the timepoints observed in this model.

We provide additional description in the Methods (line 542) describing EAE lesion compared to non-lesion analysis and updated the figure to increase the n for lesion and non-lesion ROIs (Figure 7F).

For our single cell RNA-seq experiments, 3 biological animal replicates were used for <italic>B2m<sup>tdT</sup></italic> and 4 biological animal replicates were used for <italic>Cd74<sup>tdT</sup></italic>. Animals were sacrificed at one time-point with clinical scores indicated in the Methods (Line 627).

Nature Medicine 2018 EAE spinal cord oligodendroglial subclustering with methods described in line 703. We added an additional two figures Figure 11 and Figure 11—figure supplement 1 comparing our mouse EAE dataset with Falcao et al. mouse EAE dataset. Our dataset largely overlaps with the Falcao et al. dataset, with the exception of a paucity of OPCs – which we believe is due to enrichment of OPCs and lineage-traced OPCs with GFP reporter lines that were used in Falcao et al. dataset. Transcripts that were enriched in our subclusters also demonstrated enrichment in corresponding Falcao et al. clusters, based on location in UMAP of integrated datasets. Comparison of the two datasets offered insights into cluster 1, which was predominantly found in naïve EAE mouse in the Falcao et al. dataset and did not demonstrate enrichment of immunoproteasome, class II and class II transcripts, which we hypothesize represents a homeostatic OL population. Subclusters with higher MHC class I, MHC class II and cell stress transcripts were predominantly clustered separately from clusters enriched in naïve mice in Falcao et al. dataset and our cluster 1- homeostatic cluster.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>11. From Figure 3G and 3K, it appears that cluster 5 can be subclustered in 2 subpopulations, have the authors attempted to perform further subclustering?</p></disp-quote><p>We indeed found that cluster 5 could be split into two clusters, which is noted in updated Figure 10 as 5.1 and 5.2. These clusters differed in terms of class II transcripts, with cluster 5.1 having relative enrichment compared to 5.2.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>12. The authors mention in the methods the redundancy in the TdT sequencing. Did this constitute a problem for the detection of the TdT transcripts in the single-cell analysis?</p></disp-quote><p>tdT redundancy was a problem in sequencing of gel purified bands isolated from genomic DNA, but was not a problem for single cell sequencing.

In general, the manuscript is difficult to navigate, with much of the information in supplementary figures.

The presence of the 2A self-cleaving peptide should be highlighted when describing the reporter genes so that the reader can better understand reporter expression from the constructs.</p></disp-quote><p>We added a description of P2A function to Line 73 to help with describing this construct and the reporter expression.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>21. The authors demonstrate the presence of the reporter fusion proteins on Western blot. Does the tomato portion need to be released from the fusion to provide fluorescence or is the presence of the fusion sufficient?</p></disp-quote><p>We are not able to determine the difference in fluorescence between fusion and cleavage <italic>Cd74<sup>tdT</sup></italic> Cd74 protein without a method to differentiate these two protein isoforms in vitro or in vivo. We expect that based on high levels of tdT fluorescence found in <italic>Cd74<sup>tdT</sup></italic> reporter animals and only 10-20% of Cd74 protein represented as fusion protein length on western blots that the presence of this fusion protein likely does not impact reporter expression and that 80-90% of the Cd74 is efficiently cleaved by P2A, which is sufficient for robust reporter expression. We have performed additional experiments assessing antigen presentation by <italic>Cd74<sup>TdT</sup></italic> splenocytes to <italic>OT-II</italic> CD4 T cells in Figure 1—figure supplement 2. Notably, there was no difference between wild-type and <italic>Cd74<sup>tdT</sup></italic> splenocytes in influencing CD4 T cell proliferation and activation, suggesting that the fusion protein does not impact Cd74 function, at least in terms of antigen presentation.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>22. B2m and CD74 are necessary for cell surface expression of class I and II, respectively. Do the fusions influence (disrupt) cell surface class I or class II expression in reporter mice?</p></disp-quote><p>We did not detect fusion proteins in <italic>B2m<sup>tdT</sup></italic> reporter animals. <italic>Cd7t<sup>TdT</sup></italic> reporter animals did have 10-20% of Cd74 protein in spleen as a fusion protein. We think it is unlikely that the presence of a small amount of fusion protein influences MHC expression, as we saw robust reporter expression in cell types with known MHC class II and reporter expression co-localized with MHC class II (IA-IE) that was induced in the setting of inflammation.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>23. Some comment on astrocyte expression, or lack thereof, of the reporters in the inflammatory models examined would be of interest.</p></disp-quote><p>We have added an additional figure investigating astrocyte expression of reporters in EAE in Figure 7—figure supplement 2. Astrocyte expression of both reporters, defined with <italic>Sox9</italic> to label astrocytes, was observed in EAE spinal cord tissue.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>24. The mouse models report on class I and class II expression, which in turn report on the presence of inflammatory cytokines, particularly IFN-γ. Please comment on the spatial distribution of reporter-expressing cells in the CNS of their inflammatory models relative to the location of the immune cell infiltrates. This would provide some insight into the diffusion of the inflammatory cytokines away from the infiltrates.</p></disp-quote><p>This is an interesting question. We assessed regional and lesional differences in the location of reporter positive cells. For EAE spinal cord lesions there was a significant increase in <italic>B2m<sup>tdT</sup></italic> positive oligodendroglia in lesions compared to non-lesions across the same animal (Figure 7F). For <italic>Cd74<sup>tdT</sup></italic>, the higher clinical score animals demonstrated a trend for enrichment of tdT+ oligodendroglia, but this did not reach significance in the whole cohort, individual animal comparison. We also added analysis of whole spinal cord sections with CD45 percent area covered of each cord section compared to %tdT+Olig2+ cells for that section (Figure 7G). We observed a positive correlation between %tdT+Olig2+ cells and CD45 density in <italic>B2m<sup>tdT</sup></italic> EAE spinal cord but observed no correlation in <italic>Cd74<sup>tdT</sup></italic> tissue, in line with our lesion vs. non-lesion regional analysis.</p><p>For analysis of other inflammatory models such as AT-CUP, we expanded our analysis to include a regional breakdown of tdT+ oligodendroglia in the brain across inflammatory models (EAE, AT, CUP, AT-CUP) to determine if there was a regional enrichment in areas of inflammatory infiltrates (Figure 8I and Figure 8—figure supplement 1B-C). We observed an enrichment of tdT+ oligodendroglia in <italic>B2m<sup>tdT</sup></italic> animals in areas with most prominent inflammatory infiltrates in each model; for cuprizone, the majority of tdT+ oligodendroglia were present in the corpus callosum, whereas in EAE the majority of tdT+ oligodendroglia were located in the ventral brain, notable for tdT+ meningeal clusters (Figure 5 A,B,D,E).</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>25. Figure 1, please show boxed regions of interest for the merged images shown below F and G at high power so we can decern at a minimum leptomeninges from parenchyma and overlapping from non-overlapping fluorescence (probably ventrolateral cord).</p></disp-quote><p>Thank you for this comment, we apologize for the poor resolution that occurred when importing figures. We have fixed this issue with a higher resolution version and included panels for cropped images in ventrolateral cord to illustrate Iba1/tdT staining for EAE spinal cord. In revised figures this is found in Figure 4 farthest panels on right.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>26. The ventral brain/meningeal cluster would be better emphasized as a separate figure devoted to the brain.</p></disp-quote><p>We have provided an updated Figure 5 for the brain, demonstrating meningeal clusters for both reporters with animals of different scores and at baseline.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>27. It would be nice to show it in conjunction with the expression of CD74-TdT and B2m-TdT. Is the meningeal CD74-TdT expression in Figure 1 Supp 3F (baseline) more extensive than in Figure 1F (EAE score 0)?</p></disp-quote><p>We have now included a baseline image comparing pre-clinical (EAE score 0) expression patterns in Figure 5. The meningeal expression was not notable at clinical score 0 animals in either reporter line.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>28. In Figure 1 supp 4, B2m-TdT expression seems extensive in the cortex (more than just layer 2) and in the corpus callosum.</p></disp-quote><p>We agree with this comment. The more extensive expression appears to be neutrophil expression: aside from immunostaining for Iba1, vasculature, and NeuN, we did not observe any other cell types that could be accounting for this expression. When performing confocal imaging of these sections using these labeling methods, the remaining expression was diffuse, (see Figure 3C, L).</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>29. Are B2m-TdT and NeuN non-overlapping in the cortex (1 supp 4J)? If so, what lineage is B2m-TdT positive in 4J? What cell types are accounting for the intense B2m-TdT signal in the corpus callosum at baseline? What is the nature of the spindle-shaped cells that are Iba1 negative, B2m-TdT positive in the spinal cord (Figure 1 supp 4E)? What is the cell type in the CD74-TdT meningeal clusters in the brain (1I)?</p></disp-quote><p>B2m and NeuN colocalize in the cortex (Figure 3L). We attempted to perform Cux2 staining for this layer, but were unsuccessful with the commercial antibodies we tried. The spindle-shaped cells in Figure 3F striatum are endothelial cells/structure that are CD31 positive (Figure 3E). The corpus callosum meningeal cluster in Figure 5C had some microglia (TMEM119+Iba1+) and likely peripheral infiltrating macrophages that were TMEM119-Iba1+, (Figure 5G). In flow cytometry of <italic>Cd74<sup>tdT</sup></italic> EAE, brain infiltrating Clec12a+ infiltrating myeloid cells and microglia both exhibited tdT+ expression, with infiltrating myeloid cells having higher tdT expression compared to microglia (Figure 6B).</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>30. In Figure 2, please provide the HPF of the B2m-TdT glial culture with IFNγ (2A). The TdT signal in 2B seems highly polarized relative to olig2 – is this a consistent finding? For 2C, it would be helpful to see the olig2 (green) unmerged images. Does the quantitation of TdT+/Olig2+ cells in the EAE spinal cord (2D) refer to total spinal cord or lesions? Similarly, for 2H, is this quantification lesion-based or total cord? How were ROI's determined for the quantitative data in Figure 2 (Please include this in the methods)? For 2F please make it somehow clearer that the y-axis is PDGFR (-).</p></disp-quote><p>We have provided high power images of a <italic>B2m<sup>tdT</sup></italic> glial culture in Figure 1I. It does appear that some OPCs have areas of higher tdT expression opposing Olig2, although this did not seem consistent across all OPCs in culture. For EAE confocal imaging, we have added Olig2 unmerged images (Figure 7A far right panel). Quantification of EAE spinal cord refers to total ROI mean with ROIs now depicted in Figure 7C. A detailed description of ROI quantification and number of ROIs has been added to the Methods (Line 529). We have also provided a spreadsheet of quantification of all ROIs, sections and animals for EAE and other inflammatory models analyzed in Figure 7-source data 1 and Figure 8- source data 2. Similarly, 2H, now Figure 7H is total ROI mean. For lesional analysis, we categorized images at lesion or non-lesion based on DAPI hypercellularity for 8-9 reporter animals and compared lesion to non-lesion ROIs across individual animals for Figure 7F. We also added an additional analysis of a small cohort of higher scoring EAE animals (3 animals per reporter) and performed CD45 staining and quantified CD45 intensity across the whole spinal cord section compared to whole section %tdT+Olig2+ cells (Figure 7G and Figure 7—figure supplement 1B-C). On a sectional basis, we saw a significant negative correlation between the degree of CD45 intensity and percentage of <italic>Cd74<sup>tdT</sup></italic> tdT+ oligodendroglia, suggesting a possible loss of MHC II+ oligodendroglia in areas of higher inflammatory activity. We adjusted the graph for PDGFRa quantification to reflect PDGFRa+ cells (Figure 7J) and added additional animals to the quantification.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>31. Why was the brain used for the scRNA seq in Figure 3 as opposed to the spinal cord? Was this analysis done on samples at a particular EAE stage? In the results text can you either cite or explain bias based on the efficiency of generating viable single cells for different cell populations? Similarly, would the immune-oligodendroglial cluster potentially be less viable since it is already considered stressed and thus the relative size underestimated? How do the oligodendrocyte subclusters differ by CD74-TdT expression?</p></disp-quote><p>Due to technical limitations, we used the brain instead of the spinal cord for single cell sequencing. Both brain and spinal cord were dissociated, however the flow cytometry core at JHU refused to sort the spinal cord samples, as the percentage of myelin debris was too high compared to percentage of cells. Despite our attempts to reduce myelin debris with multiple rounds of debris removal kit in optimization experiments prior to sort, we did not reach a level that passed this QC step. For the <italic>Cd74<sup>tdT</sup></italic> experiment, we pooled four animals at 14 days post-immunization with clinical scores of 2.5, 3.,3.5, 3.5. For the <italic>B2m<sup>tdT</sup></italic> experiment, we pooled three animals 13 days post-immunization with clinical scores of 2.5, 4, 4. We used papain for dissociation, as we found this was the best for isolating higher percentages of CNS resident cells and this may not allow for isolation of certain cell types such as astrocytes, we added this to text Line 240. It is possible tdT+ oligodendrocytes were underestimated in our cells isolated by sequencing, however in our <italic>Cd74<sup>tdT</sup></italic> samples that we performed oligodendroglia subclustering the percentage of tdT+ sorted oligodendroglia was 3% compared to tdT- sorted oligodendroglia and this percentage was relatively comparable to percentages found in <italic>Cd74<sup>tdT</sup></italic> EAE brain by IHC, Figure 8—figure supplement 1C. <italic>Cd74<sup>tdT</sup></italic> tdT-positive sorted oligodendroglia were found almost exclusively in cluster 5. We have provided an additional panel to illustrate <italic>Cd74</italic> transcript compared <italic>Cd74<sup>tdT</sup></italic> tdT-positive sorted cells in Figure 10F.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>32. The discussion on the highest MHC I expressing oligodendrocyte subcluster is very interesting (proteosome, PD-L1) and I would recommend expanding this discussion since this cluster is the focus of the paper.</p></disp-quote><p>We added additional discussion about this point (line 314). It is intriguing that MHC class I oligodendroglia are present in high numbers in some of our inflammatory models. We observed that <italic>PD-L1</italic> transcript levels were highest in the highest MHC class I transcript clusters. This may suggest MHC class I oligodendroglia are protected from CD8 mediated cytotoxicity.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>33. In the heat map (3K) I'm trying to understand what the individual vertical bars for a particular cluster and class II gene represent? Technical replicates? Experimental replicates? Perhaps p values are needed?</p></disp-quote><p>Vertical bars represent each oligodendroglial subcluster from Figure 10A and are colored accordingly in the bar. Each vertical line represents individual cells from the clusters. We added violin plots of MHC class II transcript expression in Figure 10G, for additional illustration of these data.</p></body></sub-article></article>
