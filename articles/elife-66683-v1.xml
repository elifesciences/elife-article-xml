As we described in the Acknowledgements in the original paper, the data (Figure 1b) had originally been provided by former collaborators. We did not realize that the data had already been included in another paper antecedently published by the former collaborator. We therefore removed Figure 1b from the original paper and corrected Figure 1 is shown here.
