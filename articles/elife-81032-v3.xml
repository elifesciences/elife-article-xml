Recently, rare de novo variants in <italic>TRPM3</italic> were identified in individuals with developmental and epileptic encephalopathy, but the link between TRPM3 activity and neuronal disease remains poorly understood. We previously reported that two disease-associated variants in TRPM3 lead to a gain of channel function . Here, we report a further 10 patients carrying one of seven additional heterozygous <italic>TRPM3</italic> missense variants. These patients present with a broad spectrum of neurodevelopmental symptoms, including global developmental delay, intellectual disability, epilepsy, musculo-skeletal anomalies, and altered pain perception. We describe a cerebellar phenotype with ataxia or severe hypotonia, nystagmus, and cerebellar atrophy in more than half of the patients. All disease-associated variants exhibited a robust gain-of-function phenotype, characterized by increased basal activity leading to cellular calcium overload and by enhanced responses to the neurosteroid ligand pregnenolone sulfate when co-expressed with wild-type TRPM3 in mammalian cells. The antiseizure medication primidone, a known TRPM3 antagonist, reduced the increased basal activity of all mutant channels. These findings establish gain-of-function of TRPM3 as the cause of a spectrum of autosomal dominant neurodevelopmental disorders with frequent cerebellar involvement in humans and provide support for the evaluation of TRPM3 antagonists as a potential therapy.</p></abstract><kwd-group kwd-group-type="author-keywords"><kwd>TRPM3</kwd><kwd>neurodevelopment</kwd><kwd>intellectual disability</kwd><kwd>gain-of-function</kwd><kwd>cerebellar atrophy</kwd><kwd>epilepsy</kwd></kwd-group><kwd-group kwd-group-type="research-organism"><title>Research organism</title><kwd>Human</kwd></kwd-group><funding-group><award-group id="fund1"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution>FWO</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>G.0D1417N</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Vriens</surname><given-names>Joris</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund2"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution>FWO</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>G.084515N</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Vriens</surname><given-names>Joris</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund3"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution>FWO</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>G.0A6719N</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Vriens</surname><given-names>Joris</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund4"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution>FWO</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>11E782</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Van Hoeymissen</surname><given-names>Evelien</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund5"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution>Queen Elisabeth Medical Foundation for Neurosciences</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Voets</surname><given-names>Thomas</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund6"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100004727</institution-id><institution>Vlaams Instituut voor Biotechnologie</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Vriens</surname><given-names>Joris</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund7"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution>FWO</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>G079623N</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Vriens</surname><given-names>Joris</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><funding-statement>The funders had no role in study design, data collection and interpretation, or the decision to submit the work for publication.</funding-statement></funding-group><custom-meta-group><custom-meta specific-use="meta-only"><meta-name>Author impact statement</meta-name><meta-value>Newly identified gain-of-function variants indicate TRPM3 as the cause of a spectrum of autosomal dominant neurodevelopmental disorders with frequent cerebellar involvement in humans.</meta-value></custom-meta></custom-meta-group></article-meta></front><body><sec id="s1" sec-type="intro"><title>Introduction</title><p>TRPM3, a member of the transient receptor potential (TRP) superfamily of tetrameric ion channels, is a Ca<sup>2+</sup>-permeable cation channel activated by increasing temperature and by ligands, including the endogenous neurosteroid pregnenolone sulfate (PS; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">Vriens et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">Wagner et al., 2008</xref>).

More specifically, there are two alternative, mutually exclusive first exons (exon 1 and exon 2), potential exon skipping at exons 8, 15, and 17, an alternative 5’ splice site in exon 24, and intron retention in the final exon 28 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1A</xref>). Recent studies indicate that alternative splicing can have an important impact on TRPM3 channel functionality: the presence of exon 17 is essential for inhibitory regulation of TRPM3 by the G<sub>βγ</sub> subunit of trimeric G proteins (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Behrendt et al., 2020</xref>), whereas the use of alternative 5’ splice sites in exon 24 leads to channel isoforms with either a short or a long pore loop, exhibiting distinct cation selectivity and sensitivity to the neurosteroid PS (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Oberwinkler et al., 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Held et al., 2022</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Held et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Held and Tóth, 2021</xref>). However, the impact of other splicing events on channel function remains unclear, with several splice variants that can be heterologously expressed as channels with indistinguishable functional properties (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib41">Zhao et al., 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Behrendt et al., 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Held et al., 2022</xref>). The existence of multiple transcripts has caused ambiguity in the amino acid numbering of channel variants in patients, and the frequency of the different alternative splicing events in disease-relevant tissue is currently unknown.</p><p>To address this issue, we analyzed a publicly available RNA-seq dataset from human cerebellum and used the Sashimi plot feature of the Integrative Genomics Viewer to quantify the frequency of the different potential alternative splicing events. This analysis indicates that the large majority of transcripts in human cerebellum use exon 2 as first exon (85%), have a short pore loop (&gt;98%), and do not undergo intron retention in exon 28 (82%). Moreover, a variable number of transcripts included the optional exons 8 (12%), 15 (41%), and 17 (85%). A construct using exon 2 as the start exon, with a short pore, including all three optional exons as well as the full exon 28 (transcript variant NM_001366147.2), corresponding to a protein of 1744 amino acids, did, however, not yield a functional channel upon heterologous expression in HEK293T cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1</xref>). In contrast, a construct lacking the lowly expressed exon 8 (transcript NM_001366145.2) yielded robust TRPM3-dependent signals upon expression in HEK293T cells, as assessed using Fura-2-based calcium microfluorimetry and whole-cell patch-clamp experiments. This included robust responses to PS stimulation and potentiation by co-application of PS + clotrimazole (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">Vriens et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1</xref>). We propose to use the latter transcript as the reference for variant numbering, as it represents the longest functional splice variant that includes all exons that are frequently used in human brain tissue and covers all human disease-associated <italic>TRPM3</italic> variants. For instance, according to this nomenclature, the recurrent variant initially indicated as p.Val837Met (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">de Sainte Agathe et al., 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Dyment et al., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Gauthier et al., 2021</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Lines et al., 2022</xref>) will be named p.Val1002Met.</p></sec><sec id="s2-2"><title>Identification of <italic>TRPM3</italic> variants in patients with neurodevelopmental disorders</title><p>Through collaborations and research networks, we ascertained 10 patients carrying <italic>TRPM3</italic> variants (8 females, 2 males; age 21 months to 45 years). Eight individuals carried a de novo variant, while one male patient had inherited the variant from his mildly affected father. Like patients harboring the recurrent p.Val1002Met <italic>TRPM3</italic> variant, patients with the novel variants presented with a neurodevelopmental disorder of variable severity, variably associated with skeletal abnormalities and epilepsy. Clinical summaries of the patients are presented in <xref ref-type="table" rid="table1">Table 1</xref>, summarizing the core phenotypic features of the 10 patients. The first symptoms were observed within the first year of life in 8 out of 10 patients and included hypotonia, poor visual contact or pursuit, and motor delay. In one patient, the first concern was an unstable, ataxic standing at 14 months. One patient showed a slight motor delay in childhood and had mild intellectual deficiency but was only diagnosed when his son was investigated for the same condition. Gross motor milestones were delayed in 9 out of 10 patients, autonomous walking was achieved late, between 19 and 25 months in 4 out of 10 patients, walking with aid in one patient at 4 years, and walking was not achieved in 4 out of 10 patients (ages 21 months, 3 years, 10 years, and 20 years at time of study). Patients were stable or made developmental progress, but one individual had several episodes of behavioral changes with irritability, which were associated with transient degradation in motor skills. Four patients had cerebellar ataxia, and two other patients showed severe hypotonia without weakness and with nystagmus that may be related to cerebellar involvement. Language development was normal in 3 out of 10 patients, delayed in 3 patients, and absent in 4 patients. Two of the latter are able to communicate using non-verbal tools like pictograms. Intellectual deficiency was observed in all subjects, ranging from a low normal-mildly reduced IQ in 3 out of 10 patients to severe intellectual deficiency in 4 patients. There were no striking behavioral anomalies, except for patient n° 5 who displayed food-seeking behavior responsible for his obesity. One patient had febrile seizures. Epilepsy was diagnosed in only two patients: one patient had nocturnal generalized tonic-clonic seizures since 7 years of age, and a further patient had electrical status epilepticus during slow-wave sleep (ESES). Moreover, in a third patient, epilepsy was doubtful, and an epileptic therapy was started (patient n° 4). Note that sleep EEGs were not performed in all patients. None was refractory to antiseizure medication. None of the patients had hearing loss, and there was not a clearly recognizable facial dysmorphism. Notably, 7 out of 10 patients showed skeletal anomalies: hip subluxation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">Wagner et al., 2008</xref>), patellar dislocation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">Vriens et al., 2011</xref>), Perthes’ disease (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">Vriens et al., 2011</xref>), brachydactyly (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">Vriens et al., 2011</xref>), valgus foot (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">Wagner et al., 2008</xref>), and rib hypoplasia (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">Vriens et al., 2011</xref>). Two patients had a statural growth restriction, and 3 out of 10 patients showed mild proportional secondary microcephaly. Cranial MRI was normal in 3 out of 8 patients. However, a substantial number of patients showed cerebellar atrophy (5 out of 8 patients): vermian and cerebellar hemispheres atrophy in patients n° 1–4 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2</xref> and <xref ref-type="table" rid="table1">Table 1</xref>) and a localized partial atrophy of both cerebellar hemispheres in patient n° 7 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s1">Figure 2—figure supplement 1</xref>). Serial cranial MRI performed in three patients showed that the atrophy was progressive and was not present in MRI performed in the first months of life (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2</xref>).

ref-type="table" rid="table1">Table 1</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1</xref>). All variants were absent from the gnomAD database and predicted to be pathogenic according to at least two out of four prediction meta-analysis programs like REVEL (CADD, DANN, and PROVEAN; Table 3; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Quang et al., 2015</xref>). Eight variants occurred de novo, and one was inherited from the affected father. Sequence alignment at positions D614, L769, V1002, G1007, P1102, N1126, and S1133 shows that the variants are located in highly conserved areas, both across orthologs from multiple species (<italic>Drosophila</italic>, zebrafish, mouse, rat, and macaca) and in the most closely related homologs within the TRPM subfamily, namely TRPM1, TRPM6, and TRPM7 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s3">Figure 1—figure supplement 3</xref>). The previously identified and novel disease-associated variants localize to different regions of TRPM3, including the cytosolic N-terminus (D614V and L769V), the transmembrane region (V1002M, V1002G, V1002L, G1007S, and P1102Q), and the cytosolic C-terminus of the channel (N1126D, S1133P, and S1392T; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s3">Figure 1—figure supplement 3</xref>).</p><p>When mapped on the recent cryo-EM structure of TRPM3 in the closed state and in the presence of G<sub>βγ</sub> (pdb:8DDQ; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib42">Zhao and MacKinnon, 2023</xref>), it can be noted that many of the disease-associated variants cluster at the interface between the transmembrane domain and the cytosol (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s2">Figure 1—figure supplement 2</xref>). Notably, the N-terminal L769 sits in close proximity to V1002 and G1007 at the cytosolic end of transmembrane helix S4 and the S4-S5 linker, whereas N1126 and S1133 are located in the cytosolic TRP helix, which runs parallel to the plasma membrane, in close proximity to the S4-S5 linker. Thus, disease-associated variants affecting these residues are localized in a region that is critically involved in the gating of TRP and related voltage-gated cation channels. Interestingly, residue D614 is located in a cytosolic loop that is disordered in the cryo-EM structures. In the structure of the TRPM3 channel subunit in contact with nanobody-tethered G<sub>βγ</sub> (pdb:8DDQ), D614 is located just adjacent to the TRPM3-G<sub>βγ</sub> interaction site (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Behrendt et al., 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib42">Zhao and MacKinnon, 2023</xref>) raising the possibility that charge neutralization in the D614V variant may affect G<sub>βγ</sub>-dependent channel regulation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s2">Figure 1—figure supplement 2</xref>).</p></sec><sec id="s2-3"><title>Functional expression of disease-related <italic>TRPM3</italic> variants</title><p>To address whether the seven newly identified variants affect TRPM3 channel activity, we introduced the corresponding point mutations into a previously well-characterized human TRPM3 expression vector for heterologous expression (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">Van Hoeymissen et al., 2020</xref>). Fura-2-based calcium imaging in transfected HEK293T cells was used to evaluate basal channel activity and responses to the TRPM3 antagonist primidone (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Krügel et al., 2017</xref>) and to investigate the sensitivity toward stimulation via the agonist PS. In line with earlier work, cells transfected with the WT TRPM3 construct showed a small increase in basal intracellular calcium concentration ([Ca<sup>2+</sup>]<sub>i</sub>) compared to non-transfected (NT) cells. In WT transfected cells, the cytosolic [Ca<sup>2+</sup>]<sub>i</sub> decreased slightly in response to treatment with a high dose of primidone (100 µM; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3A and B</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s1">Figure 3—figure supplement 1</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s1">Figure 4—figure supplement 1</xref>).

We highlight a cerebellar phenotype (ataxia or severe hypotonia, nystagmus or abnormal oculomotricity, and cerebellar atrophy) in more than half of the patients as a novel feature of the TRPM3-linked disease pattern.

This should encourage repetition of brain imaging in the early years of life in ataxic children. Although clinical variability, even intra-familial, is observed with the same mutation, we point on some possible genotype-phenotype correlation to be confirmed in larger series, with p.(Gly1007Ser) being associated with a milder phenotype and p.(Asn1126Asp) with a more severe phenotype.</p><p>Functional characterization of the newly identified <italic>TRPM3</italic> variants revealed a pronounced gain-of-function phenotype for all variants in the heterozygous (WT + mutant) condition. Typically, cells expressing these variants along with the WT channel displayed an elevated intracellular calcium concentration and increased calcium responses upon stimulation with PS. These characteristics are consistent with the previously described gain-of-function <italic>TRPM3</italic> variants p.(Val1002Met) and p.(Pro1102Gln) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">Van Hoeymissen et al., 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib41">Zhao et al., 2020</xref>).</p><p>The different disease-associated gain-of-function variants occur in different parts of the TRPM3 channel, including the cytosolic N-terminus, the transmembrane region, and the cytosolic C-terminus, suggesting that they increase channel activity via distinct mechanisms (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s2">Figure 1—figure supplement 2</xref>). Based on fluorescent tagging of the channels, we can exclude increased protein expression levels as an underlying mechanism, suggesting that the variants affect channel gating or membrane localization (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s4">Figure 3—figure supplement 4</xref>). In this respect, it is interesting to note that when mapped on the recent cryo-EM structure of TRPM3, the affected residues L769, V1002, G1007, N1126, and S1133 cluster at the interface between the transmembrane domain and the cytosol, in the gating of TRPM3 and related channels with six transmembrane domains (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s2">Figure 1—figure supplement 2</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Owsianik et al., 2006</xref>). The D614V variant is located adjacent to exon 17, in a region that is not resolved in the cryo-EM structures of the entire TRPM3 channel but forms the N-terminal interaction site for the binding of the G<sub>βγ</sub> subunits of trimeric G proteins, leading to channel inhibition (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Badheka et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Dembla et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Quallo et al., 2017</xref>). Intriguingly, our previous results showed a reduced sensitivity toward G<sub>βγ</sub>-dependent modulation for the p.(Val1002Met) variant compared to WT transfected cells (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">Van Hoeymissen et al., 2020</xref>). Further work will be needed to clarify whether increased activation of the D614V variant occurs (partly) via disturbed binding of the G<sub>βγ</sub> subunits. Interestingly, there are known mutations in the upstream genetic component guanine nucleotide-binding protein beta 1 (GNB1) causing severe neurodevelopmental disability, hypotonia, and seizures (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Petrovski et al., 2016</xref>). In addition, other mutations in GNB2 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Fukuda et al., 2020</xref>) and GNB5 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Lodder et al., 2016</xref>) are observed in patients with neurodevelopmental disorders. Potentially, these neurodevelopmental phenotypes could be partially explained via dysregulation of downstream TRPM3 activity.</p><p>Notably, L769V was the only variant that exhibited no functional activity when expressed in the absence of WT channel subunits, whereas it caused a gain-of-function in the presence of WT subunits, which corresponds to the situation in the cells of the heterozygous patients. One possible explanation could be that the variation in the N-terminus affects proper trafficking of the homotetrameric channel to the plasma membrane and that this trafficking deficit can be rescued by heteromeric channels composed of WT and variant subunits. Clearly, further research is needed to pinpoint the molecular and cellular mechanisms that lead to the gain-of-function caused by the channel variants and to reveal the pathophysiological mechanisms whereby altered channel function leads to the complex symptoms encountered by the patients.</p><p>Importantly, the increased channel activity under basal conditions and associated increased basal calcium levels observed with all the characterized disease-associated <italic>TRPM3</italic> variants can be blocked by application of a high dose of the antiepileptic drug primidone, which has been identified as a direct TRPM3 antagonist in in vitro studies and in animal models (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Krügel et al., 2017</xref>). Since plasma levels in subjects taking primidone are expected to be sufficiently high to cause significant inhibition of TRPM3 activity, it will be of great interest to evaluate whether the drug can alleviate or revert symptoms in patients carrying disease-associated <italic>TRPM3</italic> variants.</p><p>Taken together, we have described seven novel variants in patients with a <italic>TRPM3-</italic>associated neurodevelopmental syndrome. The clinical phenotype of these patients is variable, with GDD and ID as consistent features. Epileptic seizures, skeletal anomalies, and pain insensitivity are observed in a subset of patients, and more than half of the patients presented with a cerebellar phenotype (ataxia or severe hypotonia, nystagmus, or abnormal oculomotricity) associated with a progressive cerebellar atrophy. We propose that <italic>TRPM3</italic> should be added in NGS panels designed for the diagnosis of epilepsy, ID, and congenital ataxia. The disease-associated variants consistently result in a pronounced gain of channel function, providing strong support for the hypothesis that increased channel activity, potentially leading to neuronal hyperexcitability and cellular calcium overload, underlies a spectrum of TRPM3 channelopathies.</p></sec><sec id="s4" sec-type="materials|methods"><title>Materials and methods</title><sec id="s4-1"><title>Patient recruitment and genomic sequencing</title><p>Patients with <italic>TRPM3</italic> variants were recruited through GeneMatcher (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Sobreira et al., 2015</xref>) or previous collaboration between the participating teams.

She has a healthy brother. No medical history in the family was reported. She was born at term without significant pregnancy history. Birth parameters were within normal limits. Initially, psychomotor development was described as normal, with head holding before 3 months, and she was able to sit at around 8 months. The first parental concerns occurred at 14 months as the first steps were abnormally unstable. A neurological assessment at 2 years noted ataxic of stance and gait, and dysmetria. The child evolved with a motor delay and acquired autonomous but unsteady walking at 25 months. She evolved with cerebellar motor symptoms, ataxia of stance and gait, dysmetria, adiadochokinesia, intention tremor, dysarthria, and saccadic breakdown of smooth pursuit with strabismus. The onset of speech appeared normally despite dysarthria. During its evolution, until the last examination at 13 years, she made motor progress, walking is less ataxic, but she had persistent tremor in fine motor skills and severe dysarthria. She never had seizure. She had a neuropsychological assessment at 10 years which showed mild ID (total IQ not calculable because of the heterogeneity of the scores). Difficulties were more marked in executive functions (perseveration, distractibility, and disorder of emotion regulation) and visuospatial function. She was in normal school and had intervention aids such as speech therapy, physiotherapy, and adapted educational equipment. She needed help because of lack of autonomy and emotional immaturity. Brain MRIs performed at 3 years 8 months showed cerebellar atrophy, predominant on the superior cerebellar vermis (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2</xref>), which had increased at 10 years.

Ophthalmological examination revealed a severely reduced central visual acuity, photophobia, normal funduscopy, and a mitigated photopic and scotopic ERG responses with normal flash evoked visual responses. These findings were compatible with a mainly central retinal dysfunction. She also had a Mittendorf cataract at the right eye. MRI performed at 6 months was considered normal. At 11 months, she was able to smile, but she had axial hypotonia, poor visual contact, was unable to sit, and had hand wringing. She had no feeding difficulties. MRI was performed at 16 months and showed a slight enlargement of cerebellar sulci. She progressed slowly, and at 5 years, she was able to walk with assistance, with unsteady gait. She had febrile seizures. Wake EEG showed background slowing without epileptic discharges, and she had some episodes of sharp waves in the fronto-central regions during the night. Head circumference (HC) was at –2.5 SD. She had pes calcaneovalgus and slight dysmorphism, with wide nasal bridge, thin upper lip, and pointed chin.

Left hip luxation was treated by abduction splint for 6 months. She had hypotonia and feeding difficulties from the first weeks, and her development was significantly delayed. She was able to attain head control and independent sitting but was never able to stand alone or walk. She had a paralytic thoracolumbar kyphoscoliosis requiring surgical treatment at 15 years old. She had failure to thrive, and her HC growth slowed in the first months to reach −2 SD. At 20 years of age, she had profound IDs and multiple disabilities. She was able to grasp the objects with dysmetria. She had no language due to her severe intellectual deficiency and was not able to communicate even through visual contact. Brainstem Auditorial Evoked Potential showed hearing threshold at 20 db on the left and 30 db on the right. She had stereotypies, and she never had seizures. Sleep and wake EEG were both normal (one year and 8 years). She experienced feeding difficulties with selective food, and insufficient weight and height gain were on going.

Complete ophthalmological examination (including fundus, ERG) was normal. The child was hypotonic and was not able to hold her head at 18 months. At 2 ½ years, she had growth restriction (weight and height at −2.5 SD) and secondary microcephaly (HC −2.5 SD). She was still unable to sit, but her tone improved slightly. She could not grab but was able to hold the toy placed in contact with her hand. She had poor visual contact. She babbled but was unable to pronounce words. She had no spasticity.

Most of the previous reports based the numbering of disease-associated variants on the NM_020952.4 reference sequence (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">de Sainte Agathe et al., 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Dyment et al., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Gauthier et al., 2021</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Lines et al., 2022</xref>), including the Human Gene Mutation Database (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Stenson et al., 2017</xref>) and OMIM (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://www.omim.org/">https://www.omim.org/</ext-link>), whereas NM_001007471.2 was used as reference by others (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">Van Hoeymissen et al., 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib41">Zhao et al., 2020</xref>). In this report, we based the numbering of the TRPM3 variants on the Mane transcript NM_001366145.2 sequence (see explanation in the section ‘Organization of the human <italic>TRPM3</italic> gene and alternative splicing in the cerebellum’ in Results).</p><p>For functional expression, we used four different WT TRPM3 constructs, representing different splice isoforms (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1</xref>; <xref ref-type="table" rid="table2">Table 2</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">Vriens et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib41">Zhao et al., 2020</xref>). For single-cell calcium imaging, we used the isoform corresponding to GenBank AJ505026.1, with YFP directly linked to the channel’s C-terminus, cloned in the pCDNA3 vector. For plate reader-based experiments, we used the isoform corresponding to NCBI reference sequence NM_001366141.2 cloned in the pcDNA3.1(+)-N-eGFP vector. For whole-cell patch-clamp experiments, we used (a) the isoform corresponding to GenBank AJ505026.1, (b) the isoform corresponding to NCBI reference sequence NM_001366145.2, and (c) the isoform corresponding to NCBI reference sequence NM_001366147.2, both (b) and (c) were cloned in the pCAGGSM2_Ires_GFP vector. Human disease-associated variants were introduced using the standard PCR overlap extension method, and variant sequences were verified by sequencing of the entire DNA constructs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">Vriens et al., 2007</xref>). As indicated in the results section, variant numbering was based on the amino acid position of the mutated residue in the NM_001366145.2 isoform. According to this numbering, the recurrent variant p.Val1027Met will be referred to as p.Val1002Met, p.Pro1127Gln as p.Pro1102Gln, and p.Ser1392Thr as p.Ser1367Thr (<xref ref-type="table"

Fluorescent signals evoked during alternating illumination at 340 and 380 nm using a Lambda XL illuminator (Sutter Instrument, Novato, CA, USA) and recorded by an Orca Flash 4.0 camara (Hamamatsu Photonics, Belgium) on a Nikon Eclipse Ti fluorescence microscope (Nikon Benelux, Brussels, Belgium). The imaging data were recorded using NIS-element software (NIS-Elements). Absolute calcium concentrations were calculated from the ratio of the fluorescence signals at both wavelengths (F<sub>340</sub>/F<sub>380</sub>) after correction for the individual background fluorescence signals, using the Grynkiewicz equation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Grynkiewicz et al., 1985</xref>): [Ca<sup>2+</sup>]=K<sub>m</sub> × (R−R<sub>min</sub>)/(R<sub>max</sub>−R), where K<sub>m</sub>, R<sub>min</sub>, and R<sub>max</sub> were estimated from in vitro calibration experiments with known calcium concentrations. The standard imaging solution contained (in mM): 150 NaCl, 2 CaCl<sub>2</sub>, 1 MgCl<sub>2</sub>, and 10 HEPES, pH 7.4 with NaOH (~320 mOsm). Calcium amplitudes were calculated as the difference between the maximum calcium concentration during the period of stimulus application and the basal value before stimulation of responding cells. At the start of the recording, cellular YFP fluorescence was determined as a measure of TRPM3 protein expression levels. All data represent the results from at least three independent coverslips.</p><p>For the intracellular Ca<sup>2+</sup> measurements using a fluorescent microplate reader, HEK293T cells were plated on poly-D-lysine coated black-wall clear-bottom 96-well plates after 24 hr of transfection, and measurements were performed 24–48 hr after plating. Experiments were performed at room temperature in a buffer containing (in mM): 137 NaCl, 5 KCl, 1 MgCl<sub>2</sub>, 2 CaCl<sub>2</sub>, 10 HEPES, and 10 glucose (pH 7.4) with NaOH. Intracellular Ca<sup>2+</sup> levels were measured by a Flexstation-3 96‐well plate reader (Molecular Devices). GCaMP6 signal was detected at excitation wavelengths 485 nm, and fluorescence emission was detected at 525 nm. Various concentrations of PS were applied to activate TRPM3 channels, and 2 μM ionomycin was applied at the end of the experiment to induce the maximum calcium influx.

The standard internal solution contained (in m<sc>M</sc>): 100 CsAsp, 45 CsCl, 10 EGTA, 10 Hepes, and 1 MgCl<sub>2</sub> (pH 7.2 with CsOH); the standard extracellular solution contained (in m<sc>m</sc>): 150 NaCl, 1 MgCl<sub>2</sub>, and 10 Hepes (pH 7.4 with NaOH). The standard patch pipette resistance was between 2 and 4 MΩ when filled with pipette solution. All experiments were performed at room temperature (23 ± 1°C).

Your article has been reviewed by 3 peer reviewers, including Andrés Jara-Oseguera as the Reviewing Editor and Reviewer #1, and the evaluation has been overseen by Richard Aldrich as the Senior Editor.</p><p>The reviewers have discussed their reviews with one another, and the Reviewing Editor has drafted this to help you prepare a revised submission. All three reviewers were in agreement that this is a carefully done manuscript that makes important contributions that will be of interest to both clinical scientists and ion channel biophysicists. However, the reviewers raised some concerns that should be addressed before publication, which are summarized below.</p><p>Essential revisions:</p><p>1) Differences in exon composition and amino acid sequence should be clearly described for each of the five constructs that are examined in the study, both in Figure 1 and in each of the figure legends. A justification should be provided for using different background constructs to study the mutations.</p><p>2) A more detailed characterization of the mutants is required, at least in regards to their surface expression in the plasma membrane. Surface biotinylation followed by pull-down and western blotting, or using a membrane-impermeable fluorescent dye directed at the channels would be appropriate. Alternatively, the current densities of the different constructs in a sufficiently large number of cells should be evaluated using patch-clamp electrophysiology – patch-clamp experiments should be performed for at least L769V, G1007S channels expressed alone and together with WT, showing the extent of baseline channel activity, and the magnitude in the response to PS.</p><p>3) Individual data points should be included in Figure 3B, D and Figure 4B, D. For the (B) panels, data from individual cells at each of the two conditions could be linked by a line to allow readers to assess the robustness of the findings and the cell-to-cell variability. I suggest displaying the data in the (D) panels in a similar fashion, which would be more informative than how data is currently displayed.</p><p>4) A sequence alignment should be included that allows more precise and mechanistically informative mapping of the mutants onto the channel sequence. The alignment could include TRPM3 orthologues from other species, as well as other TRPM channels that are closely related and whose structures have been determined. A discussion on the relative conservation at these positions would be informative.</p><p>5) Please comment or discuss the use of such high concentrations of primidone (100 µM) when the reported KD for its block of TRPM3 is ~1µM (Krugel et al., Pain, 2017).</p><p>6) Please comment or discuss whether mutations in the upstream genetic components (receptor, Gbeta, Ggamma, or prenylation enzymes) are coincident with any of the phenotypes.</p><p>7) Patient 1: authors refer to &quot;kinetic and static cerebellar symptoms&quot; at 365, please specify. Kinetic and static are often dichotomous pairs used to describe tremor (is it a kinetic and static tremor that the authors are reporting here).</p><p>– Patient 1: also at 365, &quot;ocular saccadic pursuit&quot; is written. Is the meaning that the patient had saccadic intrusions? Dysmetric saccades? Or saccadic breakdown of smooth pursuit? The table refers to nystagmus…</p><p>8) Patient 2: line 375 says &quot;diffuse retinal dysfunction.&quot; How was the retinal dysfunction diagnosed? Did the patient have ERG? Was it a structural finding?</p><p>9) Patient 4: line 424 &quot;Seizures were doubtful…apneas at the beginning of discharges&quot; is unclear. Apnea can be a clinical manifestation of seizures. A more detailed explanation is required.</p><p>10) Patient 5: Line 451 and table &quot;spike and waves.&quot; Were these epileptiform findings generalized or focal and, if the latter, where were they located?</p><p>11) Patient 9: &quot;nystagmoid&quot; is used at 541 and 557. Please clarify.</p><p>12) Patient 10: CSWS is referred to in the text and ESES in the table. Use one or the other and indicate in the description of the patient whether the finding was felt to be strictly an EEG pattern or whether it was felt to be part of epileptic encephalopathy. Primidone was given, presumably directed by the genetic results: was it effective clinically and/or electrographically?</p><p>13) Please give ages that EEGs were performed for all patients who had EEGs and whether wake and sleep were recorded for each</p><p>14) Additional information or discussion should be provided about the behavior of TRPM3 channels in neurons, and ideally in neurons of the cerebellum.

In combination with the YFP fluorescent measurements, they provide further support for our conclusions that the mutations lead to increased channel activity. A detailed study of potential effects on channel trafficking and stability at the plasma membrane of all the different disease-associated variants, with and without co-expression of WT TRPM3, is ongoing, but falls beyond the scope of the present study.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>3) Individual data points should be included in Figure 3B, D and Figure 4B, D.

We agree that adding individual datapoints is more informative as it allows the reader to assess the robustness of our data. However, since there are many data points per condition, plotting the individual datapoints over the bar plots will make the figure rather complicated and unclear. Therefore, we added supplementary figures (Figure 4 —figure supplement 1, 2), displaying the individual data points.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>4) A sequence alignment should be included that allows more precise and mechanistically informative mapping of the mutants onto the channel sequence. The alignment could include TRPM3 orthologues from other species, as well as other TRPM channels that are closely related and whose structures have been determined. A discussion on the relative conservation at these positions would be informative.</p></disp-quote><p>We have followed the suggestion of the reviewers and included a sequence alignment, including TRPM3 orthologues from other species as well as other members of the TRPM family. This additional information convincingly showed the conservation of the amino acid residues in TRPM3 orthologues from other species (<italic>Drosophila</italic>, Zebrafish, mouse, rat, macaca). The alignment with other members of the TRPM subfamily illustrates that all of the residues are conserved in the close homologues of TRPM3 namely TRPM1, TRPM6 and TRPM7. In other non-closely related TRPM members (TRPM4, TRPM5, TRPM2 and TRPM8) some residues are no longer present and substituted by other residues. This additional information is included in the additional Figure 1 —figure supplement 3. Moreover, we now included a figure mapping the residues on the very recent TRPM3 cryo-EM structure and additional discussion, which provides further mechanistically relevant information.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>5) Please comment or discuss the use of such high concentrations of primidone (100 µM) when the reported KD for its block of TRPM3 is ~1µM (Krugel et al., Pain, 2017).</p></disp-quote><p>We acknowledge that we used a very high concentration of primidone compared to the described IC50 value. The main motivation for this is that some of the mutants were less sensitive for primidone compared to wild-type TRPM3, as published in our earlier work (Van Hoeymissen et al., <italic>eLife</italic>, 2020) and work of others (Zhao S et al., 2020, <italic>eLife</italic>). Primidone was used to illustrate that the elevated basal cytosolic calcium concentrations were caused by the basal overactivity of the variants.

Indeed, apnea can be a clinical manifestation of seizures and because of this doubt, the EEG anomalies, and the nature of the gene, a primidone therapy was started as noted in the table. We missed to report the therapy in the clinical summary in the submitted manuscript (noted in table). The sentence in the clinical description was corrected and clarified: There was no obvious motor or behavioral modification, but sometimes apneas occurred at beginning of the discharges, making clinical seizures possible. Primidone was started but, because the beginning of this therapy is recent in this child, we do not have enough hindsight to judge its effectiveness.
