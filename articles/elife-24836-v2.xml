We introduce a method, Minimal-Assumption Genomic Inference of Coalescence (MAGIC), that reconstructs key features of the evolutionary history, including the distribution of coalescence times, by integrating information across genomic length scales without using an explicit model of coalescence or recombination, allowing it to analyze arbitrarily large samples without phasing while making no assumptions about ancestral structure, linked selection, or gene conversion. Using simulated data, we show that the performance of MAGIC is comparable to that of PSMC’ even on single diploid samples generated with standard coalescent and recombination models.

These data are potentially our richest source of new information on evolutionary history. The challenge now is to figure out how to extract this information – how to learn as much as possible about the history of populations from modern data sets of many densely-sequenced individuals.</p><p>Perhaps the best-established approach to historical inference from genetic data is to fit demographic models to the site frequency spectrum (SFS) (e.g., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Gutenkunst et al. (2009)</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Excoffier et al. (2013)</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Liu and Fu (2015)</xref>). The SFS is easy to calculate, even from very large samples, and demographic models can be fit to it without a specific model of recombination, but it neglects all information about how diversity is distributed across the genome, treating each site independently. This is a natural approximation for samples sequenced only at a sparse set of weakly-linked loci, but in large whole-genome samples much of the information is contained in associations among different polymorphisms. Because SFS-based approaches cannot use this information, the number of model parameters they can reliably estimate is limited by the sample size, regardless of how much of the genome is sequenced (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Myers et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Bhaskar and Song, 2014</xref>).</p><p>Recently, an alternative approach has been developed in which a hidden Markov model is used to explicitly model recombination along the genome (the ‘sequential Markovian coalescent’, SMC or SMC’, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">McVean and Cardin (2005)</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Marjoram and Wall (2006)</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Paul et al. (2011)</xref>), vastly increasing the amount of information that can be gleaned from samples of a small number of individuals (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Hobolth et al., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Li and Durbin, 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Harris and Nielsen, 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Sheehan et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Schiffels and Durbin, 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Steinrücken et al., 2015</xref>). But this requires modeling coalescence and recombination throughout the analysis, and as a result becomes computationally intractable for large samples (while still being far less computationally intensive than modeling the full ancestral recombination graph). Additionally, for an increasing number of populations, we have multiple genomic sequences but know almost nothing about their natural histories, including plausible historical demographies and patterns of recombination and selection; this is true even for some model organisms (see <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Alfred and Baldwin (2015)</xref> and other articles in series). It is generally unclear how deviations from the underlying models, e.g., past population structure or gene conversion, affect the inferences of these methods.</p><p>Here we present a method for Minimal-Assumption Genomic Inference of Coalescence (MAGIC) that infers the patterns of ancestry and recombination in an arbitrarily large sample of genomes while making only minimal, generic assumptions about recombination, selection, and demography. MAGIC finds approximate distributions of times to different common ancestors of the sample. These distributions can then be used to fit and test potential models for the history of the population, including the simplest model of a single time-dependent ‘effective population size’, <inline-formula><mml:math id="inf1"><mml:mrow><mml:msub><mml:mi>N</mml:mi><mml:mi>e</mml:mi></mml:msub><mml:mo>⁢</mml:mo><mml:mrow><mml:mo stretchy="false">(</mml:mo><mml:mi>t</mml:mi><mml:mo stretchy="false">)</mml:mo></mml:mrow></mml:mrow></mml:math></inline-formula>. MAGIC strikes a balance between the SFS- and SMC-based approaches, using the distribution of diversity across genomic windows of varying size to generate a description of the single-locus coalescent process that contains far more information than the simple SFS without using a detailed model for recombination.</p></sec><sec id="s2" sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><sec id="s2-1"><title>Approach</title><p>The key fact underlying MAGIC is that the relationship between the population parameters (such as recombination rates, historical demography, and selection) and genomic data is entirely mediated by the coalescent history of the sample (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1a</xref>). We therefore take it as our goal to learn the coalescence time distribution directly from the data without needing a model for the population dynamics. Once one knows the coalescent history, the genomic data typically contains no additional information about the population parameters (unless, e.g., the selective values of different alleles are known), and one can fit or evaluate a wide range of models without having to re-analyze the full data set every time. In simple cases, such as when the population is described by a single effective population size, <inline-formula><mml:math id="inf2"><mml:mrow><mml:msub><mml:mi>N</mml:mi><mml:mi>e</mml:mi></mml:msub><mml:mo>⁢</mml:mo><mml:mrow><mml:mo stretchy="false">(</mml:mo><mml:mi>t</mml:mi><mml:mo stretchy="false">)</mml:mo></mml:mrow></mml:mrow></mml:math></inline-formula>, this can be done analytically (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Gattepaille et al., 2016</xref>), while in general it can be done via Approximate Bayesian Computation (ABC).<fig id="fig1" position="float"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.24836.002</object-id><label>Figure 1.</label><caption><title>Outline of approach.</title><p>(<bold>a</bold>) Concept: we would like to infer the history of the population (top) from the sequence data (bottom), but the causal connection between the two is entirely mediated by the coalescent history of the sample (middle). This suggests that it should be possible to extract much of the coalescent information from the data without making strong assumptions about the population dynamics.

This technique is inspired by <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Li and Durbin (2011)</xref>’s method, PSMC, and its successor MSMC (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Schiffels and Durbin, 2014</xref>), which use the fact that SNPs tend to be dense in regions with a long time to the most recent common ancestor (TMRCA), and sparse in regions with short TMRCAs (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1</xref>, top left and middle left). Thus, the distribution of SNPs across the genome can be used to infer the distribution of <italic>local</italic> coalescence times. But while PSMC and MSMC use models for coalescence and recombination to assign a coalescence time to each locus, MAGIC estimates the genomic distribution of times directly, bypassing the need for explicit modeling. To do this, MAGIC first splits the genome into windows and finds the distribution of genetic diversity across windows, that is, the histogram of the number of polymorphic sites per window of a given length (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1</xref>, bottom left; Figure 6, top left). (This can be seen as a simplified version of the ‘blockwise counts of SFS types (bSFS)’ introduced by (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Bunnefeld et al., 2015</xref>).) This histogram is then used to estimate the distribution of <italic>window-averaged</italic> coalescence times (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1</xref>, bottom right; Figure 6, bottom). For small windows, these times are essentially the true single-locus coalescence times, but the inference is noisy due to the small number of mutations in each window. For large windows, the inference of the window-averaged distribution is more precise, but this distribution is far from the single-locus distribution because windows typically span multiple segments with different coalescence histories. The basic trick of MAGIC is that rather than choosing one window length, it integrates the information gathered from a wide range of different window lengths to find the small-length limit – the true single-locus distribution (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1</xref>, center right).</p><p>MAGIC’s accuracy is comparable to the state-of-the-art model-driven method MSMC (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Schiffels and Durbin, 2014</xref>) on small data sets that conform to MSMC’s assumptions (see ‘Single diploid samples’ in ‘Results’). More importantly, it can also analyze larger samples, and can be useful in analyzing data from populations with features (such as gene conversion, ancestral structure, or linked selection) that violate MSMC’s assumptions, either as a stand-alone inference method or as a way of testing models inferred by other methods that include these features. MAGIC’s algorithm, described in ‘Methods’ below, is designed to be as simple and modular as possible, allowing one to incorporate additional assumptions in situations where more information is available. This also enables the inference of a wide range of parameters, including the distribution of map lengths of blocks of identity-by-descent across the genome (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Ralph and Coop, 2013</xref>). Finally, MAGIC can use the dependence of the window-averaged distributions on window size to learn about the rate of recombination and the variation in recombination rate and the coalescent process across the genome. The variation in the coalescent process is particularly interesting because it is a signature of the effects of non-demographic forces.</p><sec id="s2-1-1"><title>Representing coalescence time distributions</title><p>For single diploid samples, the coalescent history is completely described by a single time at each locus. Thus the pairwise coalescence time distribution could equivalently be described by the hazard function (the pairwise coalescence rate, as in <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Schiffels and Durbin (2014)</xref>) or its reciprocal (the ‘effective population size’ <inline-formula><mml:math id="inf7"><mml:mrow><mml:msub><mml:mi>N</mml:mi><mml:mi>e</mml:mi></mml:msub><mml:mo>⁢</mml:mo><mml:mrow><mml:mo stretchy="false">(</mml:mo><mml:mi>t</mml:mi><mml:mo stretchy="false">)</mml:mo></mml:mrow></mml:mrow></mml:math></inline-formula>, as in <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Li and Durbin (2011)</xref>). However, when estimating the distribution from noisy data, the procedure that minimizes the error for one description will not in general minimize the error for the others. We focus on estimating the coalescence time distribution itself (rather than its hazard function or <inline-formula><mml:math id="inf8"><mml:mrow><mml:msub><mml:mi>N</mml:mi><mml:mi>e</mml:mi></mml:msub><mml:mo>⁢</mml:mo><mml:mrow><mml:mo stretchy="false">(</mml:mo><mml:mi>t</mml:mi><mml:mo stretchy="false">)</mml:mo></mml:mrow></mml:mrow></mml:math></inline-formula>), primarily because it naturally generalizes to arbitrary sets of coalescent tree branch lengths for larger samples (see below). This also lets us emphasize that the idea that the full coalescent can be described by a single <inline-formula><mml:math id="inf9"><mml:mrow><mml:msub><mml:mi>N</mml:mi><mml:mi>e</mml:mi></mml:msub><mml:mo>⁢</mml:mo><mml:mrow><mml:mo stretchy="false">(</mml:mo><mml:mi>t</mml:mi><mml:mo stretchy="false">)</mml:mo></mml:mrow></mml:mrow></mml:math></inline-formula> is a model that can be tested (as in Figure 3 and the right panel of Figure 4). For plotting results from analyzing simulations (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3</xref>), we show cumulative distributions rather than densities so that we can plot the actual coalescent histories of samples (black curves in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2</xref> and left panels of <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3</xref>), which consist of discrete sets of events, and also because the density estimates are very poorly constrained by the data (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Ralph and Coop, 2013</xref>).

We choose this statistic both because of this natural interpretation and because it can be obtained from the observed diversity distribution directly with only very weak assumptions, allowing us to delay introducing stronger assumptions until the very last step of the analysis, when we invert the transform to find the full coalescence time distribution (see Materials and methods below).</p></sec></sec><sec id="s2-2"><title>Single diploid samples</title><p>To validate our approach, we have tested MAGIC on single diploid samples generated under a range of coalescent models simulated with ms (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Hudson, 2002</xref>). MAGIC accurately infers the distribution of coalescent times from samples with map length and polymorphism density similar to that of a human genome (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2</xref>, top two rows, solid curves; see Figure 9 and Methods for detailed parameters and additional tests). MAGIC performs nearly as well as MSMC (Kolmogorov-Smirnov distance to the true distribution of <inline-formula><mml:math id="inf23"><mml:mrow><mml:mn>5</mml:mn><mml:mo>-</mml:mo><mml:mrow><mml:mn>11</mml:mn><mml:mo lspace="0pt" rspace="3.5pt">%</mml:mo></mml:mrow></mml:mrow></mml:math></inline-formula> for the simulations shown, compared to <inline-formula><mml:math id="inf24"><mml:mrow><mml:mn>4</mml:mn><mml:mo>-</mml:mo><mml:mrow><mml:mn>11</mml:mn><mml:mo lspace="0pt" rspace="3.5pt">%</mml:mo></mml:mrow></mml:mrow></mml:math></inline-formula> for MSMC). Both methods tend to smooth out sharp transitions in the coalescence distribution as a consequence of regularization. The distribution of map lengths of blocks of identity by descent (IBD) can be inferred with very high accuracy (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2</xref>, top two rows, dotted curves), improving on MSMC, which sometimes overestimates the amount of very deep coalescence, and correspondingly erroneously estimates a large number of very short blocks. The part of the block-length distribution estimated by MAGIC is complementary to the very long blocks that can be observed directly (as in, e.g., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Ralph and Coop (2013)</xref>). MAGIC is also accurate on genomes simulated with ms under a model in which recombination is dominated by gene conversion (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2</xref>, bottom row); this can be seen as loosely corresponding to a primarily asexual population, with gene conversion representing homologous recombination. In this case, MSMC’s recombination model breaks down and MAGIC’s inferences are more reliable.<fig id="fig2" position="float"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.24836.003</object-id><label>Figure 2.</label><caption><title>MAGIC accurately infers the distribution of coalescence times (solid curves) and lengths of blocks of identity-by-descent (IBD, dotted curves) for pairwise data simulated with ms under several demographic scenarios (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig9">Figure 9</xref>): a single bottleneck (left column), repeated expansions and contractions (middle), and recent admixture of two diverged populations (right).</title><p>The coalescence time plots show the cumulative distribution, while the IBD block-length plots show the survival function. When crossovers are frequent and gene conversion is rare (top two rows), MAGIC and MSMC are comparably accurate for coalescence times.

For frequent gene conversion and rare crossovers (bottom row), the details of the gene conversion process have a strong effect on the IBD block lengths, and neither method can infer their distribution, but MAGIC can still infer the coalescence times.

The space of possible trees grows very rapidly with the sample size, so that even with long genomes it is impossible to directly estimate the full distribution. Instead, MAGIC infers the distribution of some small set of features of the trees, such as mean pairwise distance and total branch length, chosen either because they are important in and of themselves or because they are sufficient statistics for some model of the coalescent process. For example, MAGIC can fit the basic time-dependent effective population size model by estimating the distribution of pairwise coalescence times, and then check whether the fitted model correctly predicts the distributions of other tree features. MAGIC is particularly suited for model-checking, since for all the features beyond the basic pairwise coalescence time one can skip the final, most difficult step in the algorithm – inverting the Laplace transforms – and simply compare the distributions at the level of Laplace transforms.</p><p>We test this approach on a sample of six haplotypes from a recently admixed population simulated with ms (demographic parameters in the last column of <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig9">Figure 9</xref>).

But to be able to consider a wide range of models for the population, one must be able to estimate a wide range of parameters. MAGIC can infer the distribution of the total length of any specified set of tree branches. For a given set, MAGIC first filters the polymorphisms in the original data for those that correspond to mutations on the desired branches, and then proceeds with the same analysis as in the basic case of a single diploid sample. For example, to find the distribution of total branch length, MAGIC analyzes the genomic distribution of all polymorphic sites, while to find the distribution of tip lengths, it only looks at singletons on specific haplotypes. For data with no linkage information, the tree features that can be estimated correspond to components of the site-frequency spectrum (SFS), but while the SFS just gives estimates of the <italic>means</italic> of the lengths of different sets of branches, MAGIC infers full distributions.</p></sec><sec id="s2-4"><title>Human data</title><p>We used MAGIC to analyze the nine diploid sequences from unrelated Yoruban individuals in Complete Genomics’ ‘69 genomes’ data set (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Drmanac et al., 2010</xref>).

To do this, rather than simply taking the small-window limit of Laplace transforms of the window-averaged coalescence time, one can look at how they change as a function of window size. In general, besides the small-window limit in which almost all windows lie within IBD blocks, there should also be a long-window limit in which almost all windows contain many IBD blocks. In between these two there is a transitional regime where the window length lies within the bulk of the distribution of IBD block lengths; finding this transitional length gives an estimate of the recombination rate.</p><p>Because the transition from the small-window to the large-window limit is not very sharp (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6</xref>, bottom right), this estimate of the recombination rate is very rough. A more precise estimation requires a specific model of recombination and coalescence, like the one used by MSMC. But even if one does not have a good model for the dynamics of a population, one can make the assumption that all autosomes are experiencing roughly the same dynamics, whatever they are. (This assumption is implicit in all demographic inference from full genomes.) In that case, the dependence of the Laplace transforms of the window-averaged coalescence time on window length should be similar across autosomes, and differences in average recombination rates across chromosomes should be detectable as rescalings of the window lengths. MAGIC can therefore use these rescalings to precisely estimate <italic>relative</italic> recombination rates.</p><p>As an example of this approach, we analyze each autosome across the nine unrelated Yoruban individuals in the data set. We find that the Laplace transforms of their window-averaged coalescence time distributions all show a similar dependence on window length (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5</xref>, top left). Up to a rescaling in length, the autosomes appear very similar (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5</xref>, top center), with the exception of 19. The collapse of the remaining 21 autosomes suggests that they differ primarily in the amount of very recent coalescence (rescaling the heterozygosity) and in average recombination rates (rescaling the window lengths). The scaling factors for the window lengths therefore are an estimate of relative recombination rates, and are indeed very close to values measured by <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Kong et al.

However, the other autosomes do not have identical gene densities, and there are several large regions with unusual patterns of diversity, such as the MHC locus and flanking regions on chromosome 6. Indeed, even after rescaling, there is still more residual variation in coalescence across the 21 similar autosomes than would be expected by chance under the genomic coalescence time distributions inferred by MAGIC and MSMC (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5</xref>, top right). This variation must be due to non-demographic factors driving coalescence; the fact that they are readily detectable suggests that one should be cautious in interpreting the details of the results of model-based inference in terms of demography.<fig id="fig5" position="float"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.24836.006</object-id><label>Figure 5.</label><caption><title>Integrating diversity patterns across length scales allows to compare recombination rates among chromosomes and to test whether the observed patterns can be explained by a single shared demographic history.</title><p>Top left: One value of the Laplace transform of the window-averaged coalescence time distribution as a function of window size for each autosome.

To see the difference between MAGIC and an SFS-based approach, consider the information that can be gained from sites with singleton polymorphisms. Under an approach that treats sites independently, these can be summarized by one number – their genomic frequency – which can only be used to estimate one number – the mean total tip length of coalescent trees. MAGIC, in contrast, also considers how clustered the sites are over a wide range of lengthscales, allowing it to estimate not just the mean, but the whole distribution of total tip lengths.</p><p>While this manuscript was in preparation, two other methods extending the SFS by using linkage information were posted. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Terhorst et al. (2017)</xref>’s SMC++ uses the SFS to augment the pairwise coalescent inference approach of PSMC; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Beeravolu Reddy et al., 2016</xref>’s ABLE uses ms to fit demographic models to <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Bunnefeld et al., 2015</xref>’s ‘blockwise SFS’ statistics. These methods share MAGIC’s aim of taking advantage of linkage information for large samples, and as mentioned above, ABLE’s initial summary of the genomic diversity is related to MAGIC’s. The fundamental difference is that both SMC++ and ABLE use explicit coalescence and recombination processes (SMC’ for SMC++, ms’s ancestral recombination graph for ABLE) to fit specified demographic models, while MAGIC focuses on just estimating the coalescence time distributions.</p><p>MAGIC is designed to be complementary to the existing inference methods, which largely rely on fitting simplified demographic models that neglect selection (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Schraiber and Akey, 2015</xref>). Because MAGIC makes no assumptions about whether coalescence is driven by demography or selection, and only minimal assumptions about mutation and recombination, it can be used as a first-pass analysis of genomes from species whose natural histories are not already well-known, with its results informing the choice of more detailed, model-based methods that use additional information outside of the sample sequences. Conversely, MAGIC can be used for a necessary final step missing in many demographic inference projects: model checking. To evaluate a model produced by other methods, one can use MAGIC to estimate additional parameters beyond those used to fit the model, and then test whether the model reproduces those values. If it does, this can be a crucial sign that the model is capturing important features of the underlying history, while if it does not, the deviations can point to ways in which the model needs to be adjusted (as with the inferences of the recent past of the Yoruban population above).</p><p>Finally, MAGIC’s estimated Laplace transforms could also be used directly to fit population models (including non-standard ones incorporating, for instance, linked selection, that are not implemented in existing inference methods). Because MAGIC converts the genomic distribution of diversity into the Laplace transforms of single-locus coalescent times, fitting models to its results requires only single-locus coalescent simulations or calculations, which are much less computationally intensive than multi-locus ones. They can thus reasonably be found analytically or via Approximate Bayesian Computation for many models.</p><p>Even for populations for which there are good <italic>a priori</italic> models, the minimal-assumption approach has advantages. Because MAGIC has a modular structure and is not tailored to a specific population model, it can be used to quickly analyze many populations with very different dynamics, with each population’s model incorporated in just the last step of the analysis. Similarly, for any given population, MAGIC can estimate many different parameters describing coalescence and recombination to answer multiple questions about the historical dynamics. Finally, not using any explicit model of coalescence and recombination keeps MAGIC’s algorithm simple enough that it runs quickly even on very large sample sizes, and that users familiar with Python can understand and modify it.</p><p>There are a number of potential modifications to MAGIC that users could make. At a minimum, there are likely to be technical improvements to the estimation methods that would allow it to get more information out of the data. More interestingly, the range of parameters estimated by MAGIC could be extended. In particular, MAGIC currently infers the distributions of features of coalescent trees that can be found from unphased, unpolarized polymorphism data, but it could be extended to take advantage of this extra information when available. It would also be possible to extend MAGIC so that it would infer <italic>joint</italic> distributions of different coalescence times, rather than just all the marginal distributions. This would greatly increase the amount of information that could be extracted from extremely large data sets such as are likely to be available in the near future.</p></sec><sec id="s4" sec-type="materials|methods"><title>Materials and methods</title><sec id="s4-1"><title>Diversity across genomic windows</title><p>A sample set of genomes will comprise many blocks of sequence with different coalescent histories; by looking at the distribution of genetic diversity across blocks, one can estimate the coalescence time distribution of the population the sample was drawn from. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Li and Durbin (2011)</xref> and <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Schiffels and Durbin (2014)</xref> try to do this by considering all possible boundaries between the blocks using a hidden Markov model.

Your article has been favorably evaluated by Diethard Tautz (Senior Editor) and three reviewers, one of whom, Magnus Nordborg (Reviewer #1), is a member of our Board of Reviewing Editors. The following individuals involved in review of your submission have agreed to reveal their identity: Stephan Schiffels (Reviewer #2); Paul Marjoram (Reviewer #3).</p><p>The reviewers have discussed the reviews with one another and the Reviewing Editor has drafted this decision to help you prepare a revised submission.</p><p>Summary:</p><p>Polymorphism data contains information about the evolutionary history of the population, and can be used for inference about the process that gave rise to the data. In the era of cheap genome sequencing, this is of great interest. However, generally speaking, the polymorphism data reflects an underlying &quot;ancestral recombination graph&quot;, which, in itself, is a product of the evolutionary process. If we could infer this graph, we would not need the polymorphism data. This theoretical paper describes a method for extracting information about this graph under a fairly general model – information that can then be used for further dissection of the evolutionary process. As is demonstrated in the paper, this can be massively more efficient than trying to infer the details of this process directly from the polymorphism data.</p><p>Essential revisions:</p><p>The analysis of real data and its presentation could be improved, and help readers understand the method better. For example, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4</xref> shows that MAGIC apparently doesn't improve population size estimates in Yoruba over MSMC, even though the MSMC results are based on single individuals while MAGIC analyses all 9 simultaneously.

The key part is –at the end of the subsection “Human data” – we think that MAGIC can be used with ad hoc ABC to match multiple inferred branch length distributions, or to check the results of multiple stand-alone inference methods. We have also added more on this point in the second paragraph of the subsection “Approach” and in the fourth paragraph of the Discussion.</p></body></sub-article></article>
