While the effects of R-loops on health and disease are well established, there is still an incomplete understanding of the cellular processes responsible for their removal from eukaryotic genomes. Here, we show that a core regulator of chromosome architecture —the Smc5/6 complex— plays a crucial role in the removal of R-loop structures formed during gene transcription. Consistent with this, budding yeast mutants defective in the Smc5/6 complex and enzymes involved in R-loop resolution show strong synthetic interactions and accumulate high levels of RNA-DNA hybrid structures in their chromosomes. Importantly, we demonstrate that the Smc5/6 complex acts on specific types of RNA-DNA hybrid structures in vivo and promotes R-loop degradation by the RNase H2 enzyme in vitro. Collectively, our results reveal a crucial role for the Smc5/6 complex in the removal of toxic R-loops formed at highly transcribed genes and telomeres.</p></abstract><abstract abstract-type="plain-language-summary"><title>eLife digest</title><p>Cells are constantly exposed to external and internal processes that threaten the integrity of their genetic information.

Successful maintenance of genomic integrity requires constant monitoring and repair of DNA lesions because genomes are under constant attack from endogenous sources of DNA damage (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib82">Tubbs and Nussenzweig, 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib81">Thada and Greenberg, 2022</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib44">Lindahl and Nyberg, 1972</xref>). One of the most common sources of endogenous DNA damage is the formation of RNA-DNA hybrid structures in chromosomes. During transcription, nascent RNA transcripts can re-anneal to complementary DNA strands producing an RNA-DNA hybrid and displace the template strand, creating an obstacle to the progression of the DNA replication machinery. The resulting RNA-DNA hybrid and displaced ssDNA segment —together termed the R-loop— are highly deleterious for genome integrity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Chatzidoukaki et al., 2021</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Costantino and Koshland, 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">De Magis et al., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib77">Stork et al., 2016</xref>). RNA-DNA hybrid structures can also be formed under a variety of physiological conditions in eukaryotic genomes and play important roles in cell physiology and regulate genome dynamics. Common physiological roles of RNA-DNA hybrids include immunoglobulin class switching recombination of B cells in vertebrates (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib86">Yu et al., 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib69">Roy et al., 2008</xref>), mitochondrial DNA replication (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib65">Pohjoismäki et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib84">Xu and Clayton, 1996</xref>), bacterial plasmid replication (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Baker and Kornberg, 1988</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib51">McLean et al., 2022</xref>), and CRISPR-Cas9 gene editing (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib88">Zhang et al., 2021</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib83">Xiao et al., 2017</xref>). Moreover, RNA-DNA hybrids co-ordinate specific regulatory steps in transcription initiation and termination (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib75">Sidorenkov et al., 1998</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib76">Skourti-Stathaki et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib59">Nudler et al., 1997</xref>), telomere homeostasis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Balk et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib46">Luke et al., 2008</xref>), and gene expression (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Crossley et al., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">García-Muse and Aguilera, 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Brambati et al., 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib57">Niehrs and Luke, 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib87">Zardoni et al., 2021</xref>). However, the formation of unprogrammed or non-physiological RNA-DNA hybrid structures can interfere with DNA replication-related processes, resulting in replicative stress and the formation of DNA double-strand breaks (DSBs) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Crossley et al., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Aguilera and García-Muse, 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib73">Santos-Pereira and Aguilera, 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Hamperl et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">Kumar et al., 2021</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">Kim et al., 2024</xref>). Importantly, exposed ssDNA in the R-loop can be cleaved by different endonucleases leading to DNA breaks and/or mutagenic events, and can also adopt harmful secondary structures (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Freudenreich, 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib52">Miglietta et al., 2020</xref>). R-loop-induced DNA damage and genomic rearrangements have been linked to various disease states in humans. Examples include trinucleotide repeat-associated diseases, auto-immune disorders, neurological disorders, and cancer, although it is not currently known whether R-loops play a causative or consequential role in such diseases (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">García-Muse and Aguilera, 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib67">Richard and Manley, 2017</xref>).</p><p>To mitigate the toxic consequences associated with the presence of unprogrammed RNA-DNA hybrids in chromosomes, several cellular mechanisms work in concert to prevent their formation, and when they do accumulate, remove them from eukaryotic genomes. For instance, the Ribonuclease H (RNase H) family of enzymes plays a central role in degrading the RNA moiety of R-loops created under a variety of genomic conditions (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib42">Lazzaro et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib45">Lockhart et al., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1A</xref>). Recently, it was shown that the RNase DICER can also cleave the RNA moiety of the R-loops in higher eukaryotes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Camino et al., 2023</xref>). In addition, factors associated with transcription and mRNA biogenesis, RNA-DNA helicases, topoisomerases, chromatin remodelers, and several DNA repair enzymes are known to be involved alongside RNase H in preventing the accumulation of R-loop structures in eukaryotic chromosomes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">García-Muse and Aguilera, 2019</xref>). However, a definitive understanding of the sequence of events and exact molecular mechanisms responsible for the repair of R-loops/RNA-DNA hybrids remains to be established.</p><fig-group><fig id="fig1" position="float"><label>Figure 1.</label><caption><title>Synthetic enhancement of RNase H enzyme defects by mutations affecting Smc5/6 complex activity.</title><p>(<bold>A</bold>) Schematic model showing the mechanism of RNase H mediated RNA-DNA hybrid degradation.

SMC complexes are effectors of large-scale changes in chromosome organization and include three evolutionarily conserved enzyme complexes: condensin, cohesin, and the Smc5/6 complex (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib62">Peng and Zhao, 2023</xref>). The Smc5/6 complex is a particularly intriguing member of this family because its function —unlike that of cohesin and condensin— is primarily concerned with DNA repair, and yet its exact contribution to this process is not fully understood. Recent evidence suggests that the Smc5/6 complex is a DNA compacting enzyme that acts in vivo by regulating local chromatin domains containing unusual DNA structures that can lead to replication stress and/or DNA damage (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib74">Serrano et al., 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Gutierrez-Escribano et al., 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib80">Tanasie et al., 2022</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib66">Pradhan et al., 2023</xref>). Interestingly, genome-wide screens as well as targeted genetic analyses revealed synthetic interactions among a subset of mutants affecting Smc5/6 complex components and RNA-DNA hybrid detoxification enzymes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib41">Lafuente-Barquero et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Costanzo et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib79">Styles et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib40">Kuzmin et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Chang et al., 2019</xref>). Consistent with this, we have previously shown that the Smc5/6 complex can bind to short RNA-DNA duplexes with high affinity and specificity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib74">Serrano et al., 2020</xref>). Together, these results raise the intriguing possibility that the Smc5/6 complex might be involved in the detection and/or processing of toxic R-loops formed in eukaryotic genomes.</p><p>Here, we show that the Smc5/6 complex is directly involved in the repair of unscheduled R-loops generated by a diverse set of genomic transactions. In particular, we demonstrate that the Smc5/6 complex binds strongly to R-loop structures formed during active gene transcription and promotes RNase H2-mediated degradation of the RNA component of R-loops. Our results unravel a hitherto unanticipated role for the Smc5/6 complex in the removal of RNA structures from chromosomes, an essential function for the maintenance of genome integrity and cell fitness.</p></sec><sec id="s2" sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><sec id="s2-1"><title>The Smc5/6 complex collaborates with RNase H enzymes in the maintenance of genome integrity</title><p>In eukaryotes, two partially overlapping enzymes mediate the degradation of R-loops; RNase H1 and RNase H2 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1A</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib42">Lazzaro et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib45">Lockhart et al., 2019</xref>). To determine whether the Smc5/6 complex contributes to R-loop repair in proliferating cells, we introduced the <italic>smc6-9</italic> and <italic>nse4-4</italic> alleles of the Smc5/6 complex (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1B</xref>) into budding yeast strains defective for RNase H1 (<italic>rnh1Δ</italic>) and RNase H2 (<italic>rnh201Δ/rnh202Δ/rnh203Δ</italic>) activity. We used the <italic>smc6-9</italic> and <italic>nse4-4</italic> alleles for our analysis because they correspond to moderate and a strong temperature-sensitive mutants of the Smc5/6 complex, respectively, and inactivate its DNA repair activity in a general/non-specific manner (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Ben-Aroya et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">Hwang et al., 2008</xref>). For simplicity, we will refer to strains defective in both Smc5/6 complex and RNase H activities as double mutants and their parent strains as single mutants (i.e., even if the corresponding strains carry more than one mutant allele).</p><p>The proliferation rate of the Smc5/6-RNase H double mutants was compared to that of parental single mutants at various temperatures (23 °C, 30 °C, and 32 °C) and in the presence of DNA-damaging agents (hydroxyurea [HU], 4-nitroquinoline 1-oxide [4NQO], and methyl methanesulfonate [MMS]) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1C and D</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1A</xref>). Loss of both Smc5/6 and RNase H activities resulted in impaired proliferation even under optimal growth conditions, as illustrated by the growth patterns of haploid spores after sporulation and dissection of heterozygous diploid strains (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1C and D</xref>; YPD 23 °C). Competitive proliferation assays revealed that double mutant strains exhibit heightened temperature sensitivity at 30 °C and 32 °C compared to their corresponding parental strains (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1D</xref>). Yeast cells without RNase H activity can replicate their chromosomes normally under unchallenged growth conditions, but their replication is hampered when exposed to DNA-damaging agents or replication inhibitors (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib45">Lockhart et al., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Heuzé et al., 2023</xref>). Consistent with this, most of the Smc5/6-RNase H double mutants were more sensitive than single mutant strains when exposed to genotoxic stress (e.g., see HU at 23 °C in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1D</xref>; MMS and 4NQO in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1A</xref>). A similar growth exacerbation phenotype was observed when Smc5/6 complex mutations were combined with RNase H2 mutations in a RNase H1 proficient background (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1B</xref>). Loss of Smc5/6 complex E3-ligase activity in the <italic>mms21-H202Y</italic> mutant also gave rise to a synthetic growth defect when combined with RNase H mutations (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1C</xref>), thereby implicating sumoylation in RNA-DNA hybrid processing. Taken together, these experiments reveal that simultaneous loss of Smc5/6 complex and RNase H activities results in severe growth defects in yeast.</p></sec><sec id="s2-2"><title>Simultaneous loss of Smc5/6 complex and RNase H activity exacerbates RNA-DNA hybrid accumulation in chromosomes</title><p>Next, we wanted to evaluate whether the growth defect observed in Smc5/6-RNase H double mutants is due to defective RNA-DNA hybrid removal. We quantified RNA-DNA hybrid foci by indirect immunofluorescence on chromosome spreads stained with the S9.6 antibody (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Bou-Nader et al., 2022</xref>). Remarkably, we detected a large increase in the numbers of S9.6 foci on chromatin spreads prepared from double mutants compared to those from single mutant strains (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s1">Figure 2—figure supplement 1</xref>). Whereas RNase H mutants alone typically show a few RNA-DNA hybrid/S9.6 foci per nucleus, inactivating Smc5/6 components in this genetic background resulted in the accumulation of more than 10 foci per nucleus. We observed similar results when measuring total S9.6 RNA-DNA hybrid fluorescence intensity in multiple fields of view (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s1">Figure 2—figure supplement 1</xref>). The presence of S9.6 foci was highest in the <italic>nse4-4 rnh1Δ rnh201Δ</italic> and <italic>smc6-9 rnh1Δ rnh201Δ</italic> strains, consistent with the fact that <italic>rnh201Δ</italic> represents the deletion of the catalytic subunit of RNase H2 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2A</xref>).

Extensive research over recent years has revealed that yeast and human Smc5/6 complexes are highly conserved and show strong binding affinities towards DNA substrates that mimic single-stranded (ss)–double-stranded (ds) DNA junctions, supercoiled or catenated DNA, and even branched DNA structures (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib74">Serrano et al., 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Gutierrez-Escribano et al., 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib80">Tanasie et al., 2022</xref>). We have also established that the human SMC5/6 complex can bind short RNA-DNA duplexes in vitro (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib74">Serrano et al., 2020</xref>), suggesting the enzyme is capable of recognizing the more complex R-loop structure. To test this notion, we purified the human SMC5/6 complex and prepared R-loop and D-loop substrates (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5A–B</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5s1">Figure 5—figure supplement 1A</xref>) to conduct binding experiments by electrophoretic mobility shift assays (EMSAs) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5B–D</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5s1">Figure 5—figure supplement 1B</xref>). The size of R-loop and D-loop substrates used in binding experiments are the same, enabling direct comparison of SMC5/6 complex affinity for these substrates (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5s1">Figure 5—figure supplement 1A</xref>). We observed that the SMC5/6 complex can bind both R-loop and D-loop structures in EMSA experiments, but its specificity for the R-loop structure appeared slightly greater (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5C and D</xref>). For instance, the SMC5/6 complex can bind the R-loop substrate even at a lower concentration of 6.25 nM and 12.5 nM, as evident from the protein/DNA band shift formed at the top of the gel at that concentration of enzyme (lane 2 and 3; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5C</xref>). In contrast, we observed little to no binding to D-loops at 6.25 nM and 12.5 nM of SMC5/6 complex (lane 2 and 3; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5D</xref>) and visibly moderate binding at the higher concentrations of protein. Consistent with this, the calculated equilibrium dissociation constant (<italic>K</italic><sub>D</sub>) of the Smc5/6 complex was slightly lower for R-loop substrates than for D-loops, but the significance of this difference, if any, remains to be established (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5s1">Figure 5—figure supplement 1C</xref>). The similar range of binding affinities of the SMC5/6 complex for the R-loop and D-loop suggests that the single-stranded DNA part of the R-loop may be important for SMC5/6 complex binding on these structures—a mechanism previously observed for DICER-mediated R-loop resolution (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Camino et al., 2023</xref>). Importantly, we observed that the SMC5/6 complex maintained its binding to R-loops even when challenged with 100-fold excess double-stranded DNA analogue (i.e., Poly[d(I-C)]), a behavior not observed with D-loops (lane 11–13 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5C</xref> vs lane 10–12 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5D</xref>). These data suggest that the binding of the Smc5/6 complex to R-loops is more resilient to challenge by a competitor substrate than the interaction of the enzyme to D-loops.

We therefore tested the impact of the human SMC5/6 complex on the catalytic activity of purified human RNase H2 enzyme in a reconstituted R-loop degradation assay (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6A</xref>). Similar to the EMSA, we introduced a <sup>32</sup>P radiolabel on the RNA moiety of our R-loop substrate to allow direct visualization of RNA degradation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6B</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6s1">Figure 6—figure supplement 1</xref>). We first confirmed that human RNase H2 was able to cleave the radiolabeled RNA in a time and concentration-dependent manner (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6s1">Figure 6—figure supplement 1A–B</xref>).

Next, we incubated increasing concentrations of the SMC5/6 complex with the R-loop substrate in the absence of RNase H2. Under these conditions, the complex did not induce degradation of the RNA moiety or otherwise affect the stability of the R-loop structure (lanes 2–6; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6C</xref>). However, in the presence of low levels of RNase H2 enzyme, the same concentrations of SMC5/6 complex induced a major stimulation of R-loop degradation.

Maintaining a finely balanced cycle of R-loop formation and removal in chromosomes is crucial for the overall fitness of cells because altered RNA-DNA hybrid homeostasis can result in DNA damage and genomic instability, ultimately contributing to the development of several pathological conditions (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib48">Mackay et al., 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Crossley et al., 2023</xref>). Here, we show that the Smc5/6 complex promotes the removal of toxic R-loops in eukaryotic chromosomes. While previous genetic experiments have supported a role for the Smc5/6 complex in the natural regulation of TERRA levels at telomeres (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib41">Lafuente-Barquero et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib54">Moradi-Fard et al., 2016</xref>), our study reports the first demonstration that Smc5/6 complex activity is essential for the removal of unscheduled R-loops from the genome. This discovery is significant because non-physiological R-loops represent the most toxic and damaging source of RNA-DNA hybrids for genome stability (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Crossley et al., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Brambati et al., 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib64">Petermann et al., 2022</xref>) and failure to remove these structures exacts a heavy toll on cell fitness. Moreover, we demonstrate for the first time that the Smc5/6 complex can directly recognize R-loops, suggesting an early role in the detection and repair of these structures in vivo (see model in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7</xref>). Consistent with this suggestion, the Smc5/6 complex has been shown by chromatin immunoprecipitation to accumulate at sites that are common R-loop enrichment zones on chromosomes, including the rDNA locus, telomeres, and highly transcribed/difficult-to-replicate chromosomal loci (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Diman et al., 2023</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">Jeppsson et al., 2023</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Jeppsson et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib61">Pebernard et al., 2008</xref>). We showed that inactivation of Smc5/6 components leads to an increase in R-loop formation at several of these loci in the absence of RNase H enzyme activity, a result that aligns nicely with Smc5/6 complex localization in live cells.</p><fig id="fig7" position="float"><label>Figure 7.</label><caption><title>Proposed mode of action for the Smc5/6 complex during R-loop removal from chromosomes.</title><p>A nascent RNA transcript synthesized during gene transcription invades separated DNA strands and forms a stable interaction with its complementary DNA stand. The Smc5/6 complex then recognizes the R-loop and associates stably with the RNA-DNA hybrid structure. RNase H2 catalytic activity is stimulated in presence of the Smc5/6 complex. Effective removal of the RNA moiety from the R-loop allows reannealing of complementary ssDNA (left panel). Based on the known DNA compaction activity of the Smc5/6 complex (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib74">Serrano et al., 2020</xref>), we hypothesize that this enzyme will also contribute to R-loop prevention and/or repair by facilitating reannealing of separated ssDNA formed during gene transcription and/or after removal of RNA from R-loops. Timely reannealing of complementary ssDNA is expected to prevent re-invasion of separated DNA strands by a new RNA transcript. In the absence of RNase H and Smc5/6 complex, the stabilized R-loop will often cause replication stress and DNA double-strand breaks (right panel).

Synthetic or enhancement phenotypes involving non-null alleles reflect the contribution of two mutations to the same cellular process, but not necessarily or exclusively in the same molecular pathway (i.e., interactions ‘within pathways’ and ‘between pathways;’ reviewed in <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">Huang and Sternberg, 1995</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Boone et al., 2007</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib68">Roth et al., 2009</xref>). As such, the exacerbation of the DNA damage sensitivity of RNase H mutants by temperature-sensitive alleles of the Smc5/6 complex may be the consequence of their effects on RNA-DNA hybrid removal (i.e., thus reflecting a ‘within pathway’ contribution relative to RNase H1/H2) and their roles in additional biochemical pathways distinct from RNA-DNA hybrid degradation but still relevant to R-loop detoxification. We favor a model where the Smc5/6 complex acts at two distinct levels –within and between pathways– in the cellular response to R-loop formation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7</xref>). First, Smc5/6 contributes to RNase H-dependent removal of RNA-DNA hybrids from genomic DNA, as shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figures 1</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">2</xref>. In the execution of this function, the Smc5/6 role is substantial but not as extensive as that of RNase H enzymes (more on this below). Second, the Smc5/6 complex plays an important role in the maintenance of DNA replication fork stability, as previously established (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib62">Peng and Zhao, 2023</xref>). This role is crucial for cellular fitness in the presence of elevated R-loop levels because these structures often disrupt replication fork progression and can lead to fork collapse (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Crossley et al., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Brambati et al., 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib64">Petermann et al., 2022</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">Kemiha et al., 2021</xref>). In this context, losing both RNase H and Smc5/6 complex activities will have consequences well beyond those observed in individual mutants because it will increase R-loop formation in a context where cells have lost the ability to cope with stress at replication forks. This ‘dual hit’ will render cells hypersensitive to R-loops, thus explaining the synthetic effects of combining <italic>smc5/6</italic> and <italic>rnase H</italic> mutations. Interestingly, the dual hit scenario leading to additive phenotypes appears to be the prevalent paradigm observed with effectors of RNA-DNA hybrid metabolism. For instance, past genetic interaction studies have shown that combining <italic>sen1-1</italic> or <italic>sen1-3</italic> alleles with <italic>rnh1Δ rnh201Δ</italic> mutations leads to synthetic lethality (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Appanah et al., 2020</xref>). Likewise, inactivation of the THO complex induces a substantial increase in RNA-DNA hybrids in cells defective in RNase H activity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib85">Yang et al., 2021</xref>), similar to our observation with <italic>nse4-4 rnh1Δ rnh201Δ</italic> and <italic>smc6-9 rnh1Δ rnh201Δ</italic> mutant strains (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2</xref>). This pattern of synthetic enhancements when inactivating effectors of RNA-DNA hybrid metabolism is consistent with multiple mechanisms acting independently to promote the removal of toxic or unscheduled R-loops from eukaryotic genomes.</p><p>How might the Smc5/6 complex association with R-loops promote their degradation in vivo? Hints of a potential mechanism of action come from the observation that one of the enzymes responsible for R-loop degradation, RNase H1, shows little enzymatic activity under basal conditions and requires stimulation by ancillary factors, such as RPA, to achieve maximal R-loop degradation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib56">Nguyen et al., 2017</xref>). It therefore seems plausible that RNase H2 might also require the assistance of a separate stimulatory factor to achieve maximal catalytic efficiency. Testing this notion in a reconstituted R-loop degradation assay confirmed the model that RNase H2 activity can be stimulated effectively, and in a dose-dependent manner by the Smc5/6 complex. The two RNase H enzymes differ, however, in that RNase H1 shows very little RNA degradation activity in the absence of RPA (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib56">Nguyen et al., 2017</xref>), whereas RNase H2 is moderately active as an R-loop degrading enzyme at basal state (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6s1">Figure 6—figure supplement 1</xref>). The implication for the Smc5/6 complex is that it is probably not required to stimulate RNase H2 activity in all contexts in vivo but is likely more important in challenging environments where R-loops are highly abundant or otherwise difficult to degrade effectively by RNase H2 alone. This interpretation dovetails nicely with the synthetic interaction profiles we observed when combining Smc5/6 complex mutations with mutants that increase R-loop formation at selected genomic locations (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4</xref>). Taken together, our genetic analyses indicate that the repertoire of genomic lesions that are substrates for RNase H2 and the Smc5/6 complex in vivo is not fully overlapping.</p><p>An RNase H2 stimulatory role for the Smc5/6 complex is compelling because it provides a cellular capacity/buffer to address substantial fluctuations in the total load of RNA-DNA hybrids produced under physiological and non-physiological conditions (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib48">Mackay et al., 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib64">Petermann et al., 2022</xref>). Consequently, reducing the total load of RNA-DNA hybrids or altering its sources of origin is expected to modify the requirement for the Smc5/6 complex in R-loop metabolism (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib41">Lafuente-Barquero et al., 2017</xref>). How might Smc5/6 stimulate RNase H2 enzymatic activity? This is a question for a future study, but it has not escaped our attention that RNase H1 is strongly stimulated by a ssDNA binding protein, RPA (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib56">Nguyen et al., 2017</xref>), a biochemical property also encoded in the Smc5/6 complex (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib74">Serrano et al., 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib70">Roy and D’Amours, 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib71">Roy et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib72">Roy et al., 2015</xref>). Separate from this possibility, the Smc5/6 complex plays a vital role in promoting RPA binding and maintenance at ssDNA during homologous recombination (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib80">Tanasie et al., 2022</xref>), a function that could indirectly stimulate RNase H1 activity and R-loop repair (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib56">Nguyen et al., 2017</xref>). Addressing these possibilities will require the identification of mutations abrogating the ssDNA binding activity of the Smc5/6 complex, a difficult feat for a holoenzyme known to associate with DNA through multiple different binding modes and domains (i.e. topological and electrostatic; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib74">Serrano et al., 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib72">Roy et al., 2015</xref>).</p><p>Up to now, the Smc5/6 complex has been thought of primarily as a genome stability factor associated with the repair of DSBs, recovery of stalled replication forks, telomeric length maintenance, and virus restriction (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib62">Peng and Zhao, 2023</xref>). While it is not evident why the Smc5/6 complex would be involved in such a diverse and loosely connected group of cellular functions, it is nevertheless clear that failure to execute these functions generates toxic recombination intermediates in vivo. Under normal circumstances, the Smc5/6 complex binds to ssDNA intermediates and branched/structured substrates at DNA repair sites and the association of the complex to these DNA intermediates provides a platform for repair factors to resolve toxic DNA lesions (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib74">Serrano et al., 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Gutierrez-Escribano et al., 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib80">Tanasie et al., 2022</xref>). It is interesting to note that most of the nuclear processes outlined above involve the formation of RNA-DNA hybrids in one form or another (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Brambati et al., 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib64">Petermann et al., 2022</xref>). As such, the function we uncovered for the Smc5/6 complex in RNA-DNA metabolism may be a unifying role that explains its involvement in such a diverse repertoire of cellular functions. More work will be required to test this exciting possibility.</p><p>In conclusion, our work demonstrates a direct and active involvement of the Smc5/6 complex in the removal of R-loops from eukaryotic chromosomes. We showed the Smc5/6 complex binds strongly to RNA-DNA hybrid structures formed during active gene transcription and telomere length regulation, and subsequently promotes the removal of these toxic structures via the stimulation of RNase H2 enzymatic activity. This work uncovered a previously unanticipated contribution of the Smc5/6 complex in genome stability with important ramifications for the health and disease of all eukaryotic organisms.</p></sec><sec id="s4" sec-type="methods"><title>Methods</title><sec id="s4-1"><title>Yeast strains and cell viability assay</title><p>All yeast strains used in this study are derivatives of strain K699/K700.

Briefly, cells from the mid-log phase grown in YPD at 23 °C were collected and washed in 1 mL ZK buffer (25 mM Tris, pH 7.5, 0.8 M KCl) and were resuspended in ZK buffer supplemented with 1 M DTT. Spheroplasting of cells was achieved by the addition of 5 μl of Zymolyase (20 mg/ml) and incubation at 30 °C with gentle rotation. Subsequently, spheroplast cells were centrifuged (2000 rpm/5 min) and resuspended in MES/Sorbitol buffer (0.1 M MES pH 6.5, 0.5 mM MgCl<sub>2</sub>, 1 mM EDTA, 1 M sorbitol). Next, cells were added to the glass slide (Corning) and immediately were fixed and lysed by the addition of a fixative solution (3% paraformaldehyde in 4% sucrose) and 1% NP-40 substitute solution. Cells were spread using a plastic pipette rolled from one end of the slide to the other end. Slides with chromatin spreads were dried overnight. The next day, slides were washed with 1 x TBS (Tris-buffered saline) for 10 min and blocked for 15 min with 5% BSA (Bovine serum albumin) in 1 x TBS. Chromatin spreads were incubated with mouse monoclonal antibody S9.6 (MABE1095) (1:250 dilution) for overnight followed by Cy3-conjugated goat anti-mouse antibody (Jackson Laboratories, #115-165-003) (1:700 dilution) for 2 hr. Nuclei were counterstained with 50 μl of VectaShield (Vector Laboratories, CA) plus 1 x DAPI (4’,6- diamidino-2-phenylindole) and sealed with nail polish.

Cells were lysed by vigorous shaking with glass beads in 800 µL of co-IP lysis buffer (50 mM HEPES–KOH pH 7.5, 140 mM NaCl, 1% Trition X-100, 0.1% Sodium deoxycholate, 1 mM EDTA pH 8.0, 1 mM AEBSF, 10 µM Pep-A, 10 µM E64). The lysates (~1 mL) were then cleared by centrifugation. Once the beads were washed with the PBS-BSA buffer, the lysate were equally split between the two beads conditions and incubated at 4 °C overnight (~12 hr). The beads were then washed with the co-IP lysis buffer, with high salt buffer (50 mM HEPES – KOH pH 7.5, 360 mM NaCl, 1% Trition X-100, 0.1% Sodium deoxycholate, 1 mM EDTA pH 8.0) and with TE buffer (10 mM Tris-HCl pH 8.0, 0.1 mM EDTA) and resuspended in 2 X sample buffer (4 X Sample buffer, 0.2% of BPB [bromophenol blue],~5% ddH<sub>2</sub>O, 5% of β-mercaptoethanol). Proteins were separated on an SDS-PAGE gel [4–12% Bis-Tris] in 1 x MOPS buffer and ran for 2 hr at 120 Volts. Proteins were subsequently transferred on a membrane before being analyzed by immunoblotting with 1:2000 dilution of mouse anti-Strep antibody and 1:5000 dilution of mouse anti-Myc (9E10) antibody (GeneTex 369661).</p></sec><sec id="s4-12"><title>Statistical analyses</title><p>Results presented in this study are representative examples of at least three independent experiments.

The work is solid and will provide an advance, but how Smc5/6 is functioning mechanistically remains obscure. The work identifies altered toxic hybrids when the smc5/6 complex is compromised however, it is difficult to distinguish between cause and effect. For example, is the in vivo localization of the Smc5/6 complex to regions of the genome altered by RNA-DNA hybrid levels?</p><p>The Authors characterize the combined impact of the Smc5/6 complex and RNase H in R-loop degradation. The work is solid and will provide an advance, but how Smc5/6 is functioning mechanistically remains obscure. Is the in vivo localization of the Smc5/6 complex to regions of the genome altered by RNA-DNA hybrid levels. What is the cause vs. what is the effect?</p><p>Please address the following:</p><p>Location of rnh201D and rnh203D are unclear from Figure 1A. I believe one is mislabelled.</p><p>Has it been determined what rnh1D alone looks like with the smc6-9 and nse4-4?</p><p>The authors state that the presence of S9.6 foci was highest in the nse4-4 rnh1Δ rnh201Δ and smc6-9 rnh1Δ rnh201Δ strains, consistent with the fact that rnh201Δ represents the deletion of the catalytic subunit of RNase H2 (Figure 2A). – How would this be interpreted in the context of rnh1Δ rnh201Δ double mutants alone, which show less hybrid formation than counterparts. Please consider rephrasing.</p><p>Importantly, overexpression of RNase H1 largely suppressed the S9.6 signal on chromatin spreads (Figure 2B), indicating that the foci described above are reflective of RNA-DNA hybrid formation in double mutant strains. (p.6) – add more detail into how this was performed in the Results section – ectopic expression?</p><p>The quantification of nse4-4 rnh1D rnh203D +RNH1 doesn't look representative of the microscopy. Also, please address why there more foci in nse4-4 rnh1D rnh203D+RNH1 compared to nse4-4 single mutants, shouldn't these be the same? Perhaps it is the images in the review process, some of the images look quite overexposed/bleached out in Figure 2., please check.</p><p>The Smc5/6 complex is important for HR – why does the nse4-4 allele show no increase in damage formation as measure by Rad52 foci formation?

Authors provided evidence for a synthetic sick interaction between RNase H and Smc5/6 mutants, accompanied by an accumulation of hybrids, particularly evident at the rDNA and telomeres of double mutants. Additionally, the authors demonstrated the binding of the human Smc5/6 complex to DNA-RNA hybrids and its ability to stimulate RNase H2 activity in vitro.

Additionally, the authors successfully demonstrated the binding of the human Smc5/6 complex to DNA-RNA hybrids (with higher affinity than to DNA loops) and its capacity to enhance the activity of RNase H2 in vitro. The use of yeast cells and human complexes additionally underscores the evolutionary conservation of these mechanisms.</p><p>However, there are areas where the conclusions could benefit from further clarification of the presented data:</p><p>Specifically, the focus on combinations of mutations involving both RNase H1 and RNase H2 warrants exploration of genetic interactions when single RNase H1 or H2 genes are mutated in nse4-4 or smc6-9 mutants. A previous report (Lafuente-Barquero et al. 2017) showed that smc6-9 shows genetic interactions with RNase H2, but not with RNase H1. It would be pertinent to explore whether similar genetic interactions are observable when single RNase H1 or H2 genes are mutated in nse4-4 or smc6-9 mutants.</p><p>For additive effects between smc5/6 and hpr1/sen1-1/rat1-1 mutants, it would be important to test synergistic accumulation of hybrids in chromosome spreads. Also, detecting synthetic growth defects in pol2-MG or sen1-3 mutants is challenging since single mutants exhibit minimal phenotypes.

This approach could also allow for a more careful evaluation of hybrids in single mutants.

The authors demonstrate strong genetic interactions between the Smc5/6 complex and Rnase H2 mutants, leading to cell lethality. Mutations in both complexes impair cell growth, particularly at higher temperatures and in the presence of various DNA-damaging agents. The growth defects in double mutants are attributed to increased R-loop accumulation at chromosomes. The study concludes that the Smc5/6 complex exhibits a strong affinity for R-loop structures, recruiting the Rnase H2 complex for their degradation to maintain genome stability. This study sheds light on the role of chromatin architecture protein complexes, such as Smc5/6, in genome stability maintenance. While the genetic analysis supports the overall conclusion, further extension of genomic and in vitro data is recommended to strengthen the claims made by the authors. Particularly:</p><p>(i) The reliance solely on RNA:DNA hybrid foci using the S9.6 antibody for mapping R-loops presents a notable limitation in the study. Given that R-loops are the central focus of the paper, it would be beneficial for the authors to validate these findings through an alternative approach. Utilizing complementary methods such as DNA-RNA immunoprecipitation followed by sequencing (DRIP-seq) or bisulfite sequencing could strengthen the robustness of the R-loop mapping and enhance the credibility of the study's conclusions.</p><p>(ii) The article emphasizes the role of the SMC complex in highly transcribed regions and highlights only three loci, including one telomere and two loci from the rDNA region. However, to firmly establish the direct involvement of the SMC complex in recognizing and binding R-loops, it is imperative to conduct a comprehensive genome-wide analysis of R-loops. This analysis should be juxtaposed with the binding pattern of the SMC complex across the entire genome. Such an approach would provide a more holistic understanding of the interplay between the SMC complex and R-loops and elucidate their functional significance across different genomic regions.</p><p>(iii) The article briefly mentions DNA-damaging agents such as HU, MMS, and 4NQO, yet fails to explore their effects on R-loop accumulation and the ensuing consequences. It is crucial to investigate how these agents impact the formation and stability of R-loops, as well as their potential implications for genome integrity and cellular homeostasis. Integrating this information into the discussion would enrich the understanding of the dynamic interplay between DNA damage response pathways and R-loop biology, thereby broadening the significance of the study's findings.</p><p>(iv) While the authors utilize gel shift assays to demonstrate the binding of the SMC complex to R-loops, it is essential to address the specificity of these claims through comprehensive controls. For instance, considering the possibility of R-loop binding being a general property of ring-shaped complexes such as cohesin and condensin, it is imperative to incorporate appropriate controls to discern specific interactions. Implementing mutant versions of the SMC complex or competing with non-specific DNA substrates could help delineate the precise mechanisms underlying the observed binding events and bolster the validity of the conclusions drawn from the assay results.</p><p>It's essential to improve the readability and academic integrity of the article by minimizing the reliance on review articles as primary references. While review articles can provide valuable insights and overviews of a topic, they should not dominate the reference list, especially in the initial references. Having the first 12 references comprised solely of review articles raises concerns regarding the depth and originality of the research presented. Incorporating more primary research articles alongside review papers would enhance the credibility and rigor of the study by directly referencing the original sources of data and findings.</p><p>Some statements within the text lack proper references, such as the statement on page 17 regarding &quot;Previous studies…&quot;. It's crucial to provide citations for such assertions to support the claims made and to allow readers to access the relevant literature for further context and verification. By including appropriate references, the article can uphold scholarly standards and ensure transparency in attributing information to its sources.</p><p>The redundancy observed in the first paragraph of the discussion, resembling content from the Introduction section, raises questions about the necessity of repeating introductory information. Repetitive content not only hampers readability but also fails to add substantial value to the discussion. It's important to streamline the Discussion section by focusing on novel insights, interpretations, and implications arising from the study's findings rather than reiterating introductory concepts. By avoiding unnecessary repetition, the article can maintain reader engagement and convey its message more effectively.</p></body></sub-article><sub-article article-type="reply" id="sa2"><front-stub><article-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.96626.sa2</article-id><title-group><article-title>Author response</article-title></title-group></front-stub><body><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Essential revisions (for the authors):</p><p>Please address the following essential revisions:</p><p>i) Please provide genetic interaction studies of RNH1 and RNH2 (single mutants) with nse4-4 and smc6-9.</p></disp-quote><p>This suggestion has been implemented.

We have added more details in the revised manuscript regarding the standards followed for quantification of the number of RNA-DNA hybrid foci per nucleus. We have also clarified this point in ‘Essential revisions Point II’ above. Importantly, while counting the number of nuclei with S9.6 specific foci, we only focussed on the blue DAPI (puff like structure) area as the nuclei of interest to quantify the S9.6 foci. Specifically, we aimed to quantify intact nuclei spread and we considered that DAPI (blue) “puffs” represents roughly intact nuclei with little or no broken DNA fragments. We also provided the number of nuclei with 3-10 foci in Figure 2—figure supplement 1 of the manuscript for categorization. Finally, we have shown quantification based on intensity of the S9.6 foci (A.U.) with respect to the whole field of view that consider all the foci outside of the nucleus. We would like to clarify that we are not counting cells by this procedure (see underlined text in paragraph above), as the images only represent nuclei spread on the slide. Overall, the different modes of analysis point towards a consistent conclusion (correlation provided in Reviewer Figure 1 above) that the strains with inactive RNase H and Smc5/6 complex activity have more S9.6 RNA-DNA hybrid signal compared to their corresponding single mutants.</p><p>We believe that investigating whether the changes in the hybrid foci are primarily due to an increase in their number or also involve alterations in their sizes would be intriguing (i.e., last sentence in reviewer paragraph above). We note, however, that the preparation of chromosome spreads requires physical “spreading” of nuclei on a slide, which is likely to impact the native morphology of foci.

In this approach, detection of R-loops is directly linked to AID-induced hyperrecombination and Rad52 foci formation. We chose this approach because it is a validated method to assess R-loop formation without the use of the S9.6 antibody (PMID: 35704184).

One key reason for this assessment is that it was previously shown that R-loop formation is highly enriched in genomic regions such as rDNA locus, telomeres, and highly transcribed/difficult to replicate chromosomal regions (PMID: 24743342, PMID: 29104020, PMID: 25357144, PMID: 27298336), and the Smc5/6 complex has been shown to accumulate in these same regions by chromatin immunoprecipitation (Pebernard et al., 2008, Lindroos et al., 2006.). Furthermore, the Smc5/6 complex plays a vital role in replication and segregation of repetitive rDNA region which are prone to form R-loops (Pebernard et al., 2008, Lindroos et al., 2006., Moradi Fard et al., 2021, Torres-Rosell et al., 2005). Similarly, the Smc5/6 complex plays an important role in telomeric length maintenance where Telomeric Repeat-containing RNA (TERRA) are commonly found (Moradi-Fard et al. 2016, Potts et al. 2007). Finally, recent studies showed that the Smc5/6 complex is enriched at transcription-induced positively supercoiled DNA and is linked to DNA topology management during transcription (Jeppsson et al., 2024). Hence, based on available data, one can conclude that there is a strong overlap of R-loop formation sites and Smc5/6 complex localization in the genome. Also, it is important to point out that no RNA-DNA hybrid metabolism regulator acts on all R-loop substrates formed in the genome. As a consequence, there are limits to the expectation that the localization pattern of the Smc5/6 complex (or any R-loop enzyme) should fully overlap with all R-loop formation sites on chromosomes.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>(iii) The article briefly mentions DNA-damaging agents such as HU, MMS, and 4NQO, yet fails to explore their effects on R-loop accumulation and the ensuing consequences.

Integrating this information into the discussion would enrich the understanding of the dynamic interplay between DNA damage response pathways and R-loop biology, thereby broadening the significance of the study's findings.</p></disp-quote><p>We appreciate the point raised by the reviewer and believe the issue s/he raised has been addressed in the literature. Specifically, replication stress induced by HU or MMS has been shown to increase RNA-DNA hybrid abundance in the yeast genome, and this accumulation is exacerbated in RNase H mutant cells (PMID: 37855233; PMID: 31775053). Consistent with this, low dosage of HU leads RNase H mutant cells to mitotic checkpoint arrest causing massive cell lethality (PMID: 22244334). Additionally, treatment of budding yeast and human cells with 4-nitroquinoline-1-oxide induces polyubiquitylation of the largest RNA polymerase II subunit which affects overall transcription and transcription induced RNA-DNA hybrid formation (PMID: 16705154). We have modified the text of the revised manuscript (Page 3 Line 17 and Page 6 Line 12) to clarify this point.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>(iv) While the authors utilize gel shift assays to demonstrate the binding of the SMC complex to R-loops, it is essential to address the specificity of these claims through comprehensive controls. For instance, considering the possibility of R-loop binding being a general property of ring-shaped complexes such as cohesin and condensin, it is imperative to incorporate appropriate controls to discern specific interactions. Implementing mutant versions of the SMC complex or competing with non-specific DNA substrates could help delineate the precise mechanisms underlying the observed binding events and bolster the validity of the conclusions drawn from the assay results.</p></disp-quote><p>We thank the reviewer for these excellent suggestions, and we have performed the suggested experiments to strengthen our study. To test the R-loop binding ability of another ring-shaped complex, we purified yeast condensin in monomeric and multimeric forms (PMID: 29079757) and prepared R-loop substrates to conduct binding experiments by electrophoretic mobility shift assays (EMSAs). We observed that monomeric SMC5/6 complex binds R-loop substrates with very high efficiency but similar concentrations of monomeric condensin fails to bind R-loop substrates. In contrast, we observed effective R-loop binding with the oligomeric condensin complex. These results demonstrate that binding to R-loop structures is not a universal feature of all ring-shaped complexes (i.e., as seen with the monomeric condensin result). These new results have been included in Figure 5—figure supplement 2 of the revised manuscript.</p><p>We have also performed the DNA binding/competition experiment requested by the reviewer above. Specifically, to evaluate the specificity of the SMC5/6 complex binding to R-loop (compared to D-loop), increasing concentrations of human SMC5/6 complex were incubated with 100x molar excess of unlabeled poly-deoxy-inosinic-deoxy-cytidylic acid (poly[d(I-C)]) along with 40 nM of [<sup>32</sup>P]-labelled R-loop or D-loop followed by EMSA analysis. The results of this experiment fully support the conclusions presented in our original manuscript and are shown in the updated Figure 5 of the revised manuscript.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>It's essential to improve the readability and academic integrity of the article by minimizing the reliance on review articles as primary references. While review articles can provide valuable insights and overviews of a topic, they should not dominate the reference list, especially in the initial references. Having the first 12 references comprised solely of review articles raises concerns regarding the depth and originality of the research presented. Incorporating more primary research articles alongside review papers would enhance the credibility and rigor of the study by directly referencing the original sources of data and findings.</p></disp-quote><p>We thank the reviewer for this helpful comment. We now cite several additional primary research articles in the revised manuscript to enhance the credibility and rigor of the study.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Some statements within the text lack proper references, such as the statement on page 17 regarding &quot;Previous studies…&quot;. It's crucial to provide citations for such assertions to support the claims made and to allow readers to access the relevant literature for further context and verification. By including appropriate references, the article can uphold scholarly standards and ensure transparency in attributing information to its sources.</p></disp-quote><p>We appreciate the suggestion, and we have diligently improved the referencing in the revised manuscript.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>The redundancy observed in the first paragraph of the discussion, resembling content from the Introduction section, raises questions about the necessity of repeating introductory information. Repetitive content not only hampers readability but also fails to add substantial value to the discussion. It's important to streamline the Discussion section by focusing on novel insights, interpretations, and implications arising from the study's findings rather than reiterating introductory concepts. By avoiding unnecessary repetition, the article can maintain reader engagement and convey its message more effectively.</p></disp-quote><p>We appreciate the reviewer’s comment.
