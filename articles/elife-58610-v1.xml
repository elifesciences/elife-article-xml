The inner structure of the eukaryotic flagellum is an arrangement of microtubules (MTs) and accessory proteins called the axoneme (Ax). A highly conserved structure in evolution, the Ax typically consists of nine cylindrically arranged MT doublets cross-bridged by motor proteins of the dynein family. An internal central pair of MTs is connected by radial spokes to the nine peripheral doublets, determining the typical '9+2’ axonemal structure. Motor proteins hydrolyze ATP to generate forces that induce doublet sliding. Due to mechanical constraints exerted by linking proteins (nexins) and the basal body, dynein-induced sliding of MTs translates into bending movements of the whole structure. Motor proteins are thought to self regulate their activity via mechanical feedback, generating the periodic beats of flagella, see, for example, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Brokaw, 2009</xref> and <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Lindemann and Lesich, 2010</xref>.</p><p>Despite a general consensus on the existence of a self-regulatory mechanism, the inner working of the Ax is not fully understood and it is still the subject of active research (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib44">Wan and Jékely, 2020</xref>). While bending-through-sliding is the accepted fundamental mechanism of flagellar motility, how specific flagellar shapes are determined is not yet clear. Nodal cilia present in early embryonic development display markedly non-planar beats (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Buceta et al., 2005</xref>). On the other hand, for the most studied swimming microorganisms, such as animal sperm cells and the biflagellate alga <italic>Chlamydomonas reinhardtii</italic>, the flagellar beat is, to a good approximation, planar. For these organisms, beat planarity is thought to be induced by the inter-doublet links between one pair of MTs, typically those numbered 5 and 6 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Lin et al., 2012</xref>). These links inhibit the relative sliding of the 5-6 MTs pair, thus selecting a beating plane that passes through the center of the Ax and the midpoint between the inhibited MTs.</p><p>A remarkable deviation from the flagellar structure of the aforementioned organisms is found in euglenids and kinetoplastids. These flagellated protists have an extra element attached alongside the Ax (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Cachon et al., 1988</xref>), a slender structure made of a lattice-like arrangement of proteins called 'paraxial’ or 'paraflagellar’ rod (PFR), see <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1</xref>. The latter name is more common, but the former is possibly more accurate (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">Rosati et al., 1991</xref>). PFRs are attached via bonding links to up to four axonemal MTs, depending on the species (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib43">Walne and Dawson, 1993</xref>). PFRs are thought to be passive but, at least in the case of <italic>Euglena gracilis</italic>, some degree of activity is not completely ruled out (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">Piccinni, 1975</xref>).</p><fig id="fig1" position="float"><label>Figure 1.</label><caption><title>Inner structure of Euglena gracilis' flagellum.</title><p>(<bold>a</bold>) A specimen of freely swimming <italic>Euglena gracilis</italic>, and (<bold>b</bold>) a sketch of the cross-section of its flagellum, as seen from the distal end. The flagellar inner structure is composed by the paraflagellar rod (PFR, textured), and the axoneme (Ax). The PFR is connected via bonding links to the axonemal doublets 1, 2, and 3. The inner structure of the flagellum is enclosed by the flagellar membrane (dotted contour). By inhibiting MTs’ sliding, the PFR selects the spontaneous bending plane of the Ax (dashed line). As a key geometric feature, the solid line that joins the Ax center <inline-formula><mml:math id="inf1"><mml:msup><mml:mi mathvariant="bold">𝐫</mml:mi><mml:mi>a</mml:mi></mml:msup></mml:math></inline-formula> and the PFR center <inline-formula><mml:math id="inf2"><mml:msup><mml:mi mathvariant="bold">𝐫</mml:mi><mml:mi>p</mml:mi></mml:msup></mml:math></inline-formula> crosses at an angle <inline-formula><mml:math id="inf3"><mml:msup><mml:mi>ϕ</mml:mi><mml:mi>p</mml:mi></mml:msup></mml:math></inline-formula> the spontaneous bending plane.

The opposite convention, in which microtubules are numbered in increasing order in the anti-clockwise direction when seen from the distal end of the Ax, is far more common in structural studies of cilia.</p></caption><graphic mime-subtype="tiff" mimetype="image" xlink:href="elife-58610-fig1-v1.tif"/></fig><p><italic>E. gracilis</italic> has two flagella, designated as dorsal and ventral. The ventral flagellum remains within the reservoir, an invaginated region of the cell. The dorsal, PFR-bearing, flagellum emerges from the reservoir and serves as a propulsive apparatus by means of periodic beating. In this paper, we show that the beating style of <italic>E. gracilis</italic>, sometimes dubbed ‘spinning lasso’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Bovee, 1982</xref>), is characterized by a distinctive geometric signature, namely, traveling torsional peaks with alternating sign along the length of the flagellum. Moreover, we put forward and test the hypothesis that this distinctive beating style arises from the PFR-Ax mechanical interaction.</p><p>In order to put our hypothesis into context, we observe that the flagellar beat of PFR-bearing kinetoplastid organisms, such as <italic>Leishmania</italic> and <italic>Crithidia</italic>, is planar (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Gadelha et al., 2007</xref>). An apparent exception to beat planarity in kinetoplastids is found in the pathogenic parasite <italic>Trypanosoma brucei</italic>, which shows a characteristic non-planar 'drill-like’ motion (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Langousis and Hill, 2014</xref>). It has been claimed that the flagellar structure alone could account for the emergence this motion (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Koyfman et al., 2011</xref>). However, the flagellum of <italic>T. brucei</italic> is not free, like that of <italic>Leishmania</italic> and <italic>Crithidia</italic>, but it is attached to the organism for most of its length, wrapped helically around the cell body. According to <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Alizadehrad et al., 2015</xref>, the flagellum-body mechanical interaction can alone explain <italic>T. brucei</italic>’s distinctive motion. Confirming this conclusion, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib45">Wheeler, 2017</xref> showed that <italic>T. brucei</italic> mutants with body-detached flagellum generate fairly planar beating. It is conjectured that the PFR-Ax bonds operate as the 5-6 interdoublet links in <italic>Chlamydomonas</italic> and sperm cells, inhibiting MTs sliding and selecting a plane of beat (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib47">Woolley et al., 2006</xref>).</p><p>The spinning lasso beat of <italic>E. gracilis</italic> does not conform to this scenario. Indeed, <italic>E. gracilis</italic> beating style is characterized by high asymmetry and non-planarity. The full 3d flagellar kinematics of freely swimming cells has recently been revealed by <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">Rossi et al., 2017</xref> thanks to a mixed approach based on hydrodynamic theory and image analysis. As we report in the first part of this paper, the geometry of the spinning lasso is characterized by traveling waves of torsion with alternating sign along the flagellum length.</p><p>We argue that the key to the emergence of non-planarity lies in a prominent structural asymmetry of the PFR-Ax attachment in euglenid flagella. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1</xref> shows a sketch of the cross-section of the euglenid flagellum redrawn from the electron microscopy studies by <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Melkonian et al., 1982</xref> and <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Bouck et al., 1990</xref>. Following the latter studies, we number MTs in increasing order in the clockwise direction, as seen from the distal end of the Ax. Notice that a different convention is commonly used in structural studies of cilia and flagella, see, for example, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Lin and Nicastro, 2018</xref>. The PFR is attached to MTs 1, 2, and 3. We consider two lines. One line (dashed) passes through the center of the Ax and MT 2, in the middle of the bonding complex. The other (solid) line connects the center of the Ax and the center of the PFR. The two lines cross each other. This is the structural feature on which we build our model.</p><p>In modeling the flagellar complex, we assume that the bonding links to the PFR select the local spontaneous beating plane of the Ax, from the same principle of MTs’ sliding inhibition discussed above. The local spontaneous beating plane so generated passes through the dashed line in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1</xref>. We follow closely <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Hilfinger and Jülicher, 2008</xref> and <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">Sartori et al., 2016a</xref> in our modeling of the Ax, while we use a simple elastic spring model for the PFR. We show that, under generic actuation, the two flagellar components cannot be simultaneously in their respective states of minimal energy, and this crucially depends on the offset between the spontaneous beating plane of the Ax (dashed line in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1</xref>) and the line joining the PFR-Ax centers (solid line in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1</xref>). Instead, the typical outcome is an elastically frustrated configuration of the system, in which the two competing components drive each other out of plane. Under dyneins activation patterns that, in the absence of extra-axonemal structures, would produce an asymmetric beat similar to those of <italic>Chlamydomonas</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">Qin et al., 2015</xref>), or <italic>Volvox</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">Sareh et al., 2013</xref>), the model specifically predicts the torsional signature of the spinning lasso.</p><p>Interestingly, the lack of symmetry of the spinning lasso beat produces swimming trajectories with rotations coupled with translations (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">Rossi et al., 2017</xref>). In turn, cell body rotations have a key role in the light-guided navigation behavior of phototactic unicellular organisms (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Goldstein, 2015</xref>), and of <italic>E. gracilis</italic> in particular, which has recently attracted renewed attention (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Giometto et al., 2015</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">Ogawa et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib42">Tsang et al., 2018</xref>). Rotations along the major axis of the cell body produced by the spinning lasso beat allow the light-sensing apparatus of the organism to constantly scan the environment, and align <italic>E. gracilis</italic> with light intensity gradients.</p><p>In light of these observations, our analysis shows that the beat of the euglenid flagellum can be seen as an example of a biological function arising from the competition between antagonistic structural components. It is not dissimilar from the body-flagellum interaction in <italic>T. brucei</italic>, which generates 3d motility. But the principle is much more general in biology and many other examples can be found across kingdoms and species, and at widely different scales. For instance in plants, a mechanism of seed dispersal arises from the mechanical competition between the two valves of the seed pods, see, for example <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Armon et al., 2011</xref> for <italic>Bauhinia variegata</italic> and <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Hofhuis et al., 2016</xref> for <italic>Cardamine hirsuta</italic>. Contraction by antagonistic muscles is key for animal movement and, in particular, for the functioning of hydrostatic skeletons (used from wormlike invertebrates to arms and tentacles of cephalopods, to the trunk of elephants, see <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Kier, 2012</xref>). The mechanical coupling of the helical periplasmic flagella to the rod-shaped cell cylinder determines the flat-wave morphology of the Lyme disease spirochete <italic>Borrelia burgdorferi</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Dombrowski et al., 2009</xref>). Antagonistic contraction along perpendicularly oriented families of fibres is at work at the subcellular level, for example in the antagonistic motor protein dynamics in contractile ring structures important in eukaryotic cell division and development, see, for example <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Coffman et al., 2016</xref>. At the same subcellular scale, competing elastic forces arising from lipid-protein interactions are often crucial in determining the stability of complex shapes of the cellular membrane (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Moser von Filseck et al., 2020</xref>), and in the case of the overall structure of the coronavirus envelope (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib41">Schoeman and Fielding, 2019</xref>).</p><sec id="s1-1"><title>Observations</title><p>We first analyze the experimental data from the 3d reconstruction of the beating euglenid flagellum obtained in <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">Rossi et al., 2017</xref> for freely swimming organisms. Swimming <italic>E. gracilis</italic> cells follow generalized helical trajectories coupled with rotation around the major axis of the cell body. It is precisely this rotation that allows for a 3d reconstruction of flagellar shapes from 2d videomicroscopy images. <italic>E. gracilis</italic> takes many beats to close one complete turn around its major axis. So, while rotating, cells expose their flagellar beat to the observer from many different sides. Stereomatching techniques can then be employed to reconstruct the flagellar beat in full (assuming periodicity and regularity of the beat). <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2</xref> shows <inline-formula><mml:math id="inf4"><mml:mrow><mml:mi>N</mml:mi><mml:mo>=</mml:mo><mml:mn>10</mml:mn></mml:mrow></mml:math></inline-formula> different curves in space describing the euglenid flagellum in different instants within a beat taken from <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">Rossi et al., 2017</xref>.

Torsion, the rate of change of the binormal vector, is the geometric quantity that measures the deviation of a curve from a planar path (see the ‘Results’ Section below for the formal definition). The 'spinning lasso’ exhibits here a distinct torsional signature: torsion peaks of alternate sign that travel from the proximal to the distal end of the flagellum.

Then the plane of the curve abruptly rotates by 90° (red plane) first, and then back by 90° in the opposite direction (yellow plane). These abrupt changes correspond to concentrated torsional peaks of opposite sign. When seen in a two-dimensional projection, the torsion dipole generates a looping curve, which closely matches euglenid flagella’s outlines during a spinning lasso beat.</p></sec><sec id="s1-2"><title>Mechanical model</title><p>We model Ax and PFR as cylindrical structures with deformable centerlines, see <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4</xref>. The euglenid flagellum is the composite structure consisting of Ax and PFR attached together. We suppose that the Ax is the only active component of the flagellum, whereas the PFR is purely passive.

These forces and displacements are defined in detail in Appendix 1, and their work computed in <xref ref-type="disp-formula" rid="equ35">Equation 35</xref>. The way <xref ref-type="disp-formula" rid="equ35">Equation 35</xref> gives rise to the equivalent reformulation (<xref ref-type="disp-formula" rid="equ4">Equation 4</xref>) in terms of global cross-section variables, the forces <inline-formula><mml:math id="inf71"><mml:msub><mml:mi>H</mml:mi><mml:mi>i</mml:mi></mml:msub></mml:math></inline-formula> and shears <inline-formula><mml:math id="inf72"><mml:msub><mml:mi>γ</mml:mi><mml:mi>i</mml:mi></mml:msub></mml:math></inline-formula>, is also discussed there. Here, we simply notice that the structural constraints of the Ax lead to simplifications on the kinematics. These constraints do not allow MTs to slide by whatever amount, and the sliding of MT pairs <inline-formula><mml:math id="inf73"><mml:msub><mml:mi>σ</mml:mi><mml:mi>j</mml:mi></mml:msub></mml:math></inline-formula> are not independent. Rather, there are only two degrees of freedom that determine MTs sliding, which are given by the shear variables <inline-formula><mml:math id="inf74"><mml:msub><mml:mi>γ</mml:mi><mml:mn>1</mml:mn></mml:msub></mml:math></inline-formula> and <inline-formula><mml:math id="inf75"><mml:msub><mml:mi>γ</mml:mi><mml:mn>2</mml:mn></mml:msub></mml:math></inline-formula>. Moreover, again due to the structural constraints of the Ax, the shear variables are coupled to the bending strains (<xref ref-type="disp-formula" rid="equ3">Equation 3</xref>), as discussed further below. In Appendix 1, we derive the linear relations between the shear variables and the individual sliding of MT pairs (<xref ref-type="disp-formula" rid="equ36">Equation 36</xref>). We also compute the relations between the dynein forces <inline-formula><mml:math id="inf76"><mml:msub><mml:mi>F</mml:mi><mml:mi>j</mml:mi></mml:msub></mml:math></inline-formula> acting on each pair of adjacent MTs and the shear forces <inline-formula><mml:math id="inf77"><mml:mstyle displaystyle="true" scriptlevel="0"><mml:mrow><mml:msub><mml:mrow><mml:mi>H</mml:mi></mml:mrow><mml:mrow><mml:mn>1</mml:mn></mml:mrow></mml:msub></mml:mrow></mml:mstyle></mml:math></inline-formula> and <inline-formula><mml:math id="inf78"><mml:mstyle displaystyle="true" scriptlevel="0"><mml:mrow><mml:msub><mml:mrow><mml:mi>H</mml:mi></mml:mrow><mml:mrow><mml:mn>2</mml:mn></mml:mrow></mml:msub></mml:mrow></mml:mstyle></mml:math></inline-formula> (<xref ref-type="disp-formula" rid="equ37">Equation 37</xref>).

Consider first the two separated structures in their spontaneous configurations (left). The Ax is bent into a planar arc while the PFR is straight. Then, the PFR is forced to match to the Ax, while the latter is kept in its spontaneous configuration (middle). The attachment constraint induces shear strains in the PFR, such that the composite system cannot be in mechanical equilibrium without external forcing. When the composite system is released (right), it reaches equilibrium by the relaxation of the PFR shear, which induces additional distortion of the Ax. At equilibrium, an optimal energy compromise is reached, which is characterized by an emergent non-planarity.</p></caption><graphic mime-subtype="tiff" mimetype="image" xlink:href="elife-58610-fig5-v1.tif"/></fig></sec><sec id="s1-3"><title>Equilibria</title><p>Under generic (steady) dynein actuation, that is, given <inline-formula><mml:math id="inf160"><mml:mstyle displaystyle="true" scriptlevel="0"><mml:mrow><mml:msub><mml:mi>H</mml:mi><mml:mn>1</mml:mn></mml:msub></mml:mrow></mml:mstyle></mml:math></inline-formula> and <inline-formula><mml:math id="inf161"><mml:mstyle displaystyle="true" scriptlevel="0"><mml:mrow><mml:msub><mml:mi>H</mml:mi><mml:mn>2</mml:mn></mml:msub></mml:mrow></mml:mstyle></mml:math></inline-formula> (not time-dependent), and in the absence of external forces, the flagellum deforms to its equilibrium configuration <inline-formula><mml:math id="inf162"><mml:mrow><mml:mrow><mml:mi>δ</mml:mi><mml:mo>⁢</mml:mo><mml:mi class="ltx_font_mathcaligraphic">𝒲</mml:mi></mml:mrow><mml:mo>=</mml:mo><mml:mn>0</mml:mn></mml:mrow></mml:math></inline-formula>.

We can assume, therefore, that our model effectively describes the flagellum from its emergence point outwards. The only forces the flagellum is subject to come from fluid interaction, which we assume to act all along its length.

This is in agreement with the current understanding of the mechanism that generates beat planarity in other PFR-bearing flagellar systems. Non-planarity in <italic>E. gracilis</italic> can arise because of a marked asymmetry in the Ax-bonding links-PFR complex in the euglenid flagellum, which is not found in kinetoplastids such as <italic>Leishmania</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Gluenz et al., 2010</xref>) or <italic>Trypanosoma</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Portman and Gull, 2010</xref>).</p><p>In the absence of a precise knowledge of the dynein actuation pattern, we tested our mechanical model under shear forces that would, in the absence of extra-axonemal structures, realize a beat similar to those found in model systems like <italic>Chlamydomonas</italic>. We appreciate that the emergent distortion of the Ax, generated by the Ax-PFR interplay, could in principle lead to different actuation patterns, consistently with the hypothesis of dynein actuation via mechanical feedback. Including dynein feedback in the euglenid flagellum model we proposed will require further study, and can potentially open new avenues for the study of ciliary motility in general. While the existence of a mechanical feedback between molecular motors and the flagellar scaffold is fairly accepted, there are several competing theories arguing in favour of different feedback mechanisms. The structural and kinematic peculiarities of the <italic>E. gracilis</italic> beat may provide a challenging new model system to test the relative merits of these alternative theories.</p><p>Along with the mechanism that let the euglenid flagellar shapes emerge, it is worth considering how this characteristic flagellar beat is integrated in the overall behavior of the organism. The spinning lasso produces the typical roto-translational motion of <italic>E. gracilis</italic> cells. Cell body rotation is in turn associated with phototaxis. Indeed, rotation allows cells to veer to the light source direction when stimulated, or escape in the opposite direction, when the signal is too strong. Here, the key biochemical mechanism could be the one often found in nature, by which periodic signals generated by lighting and shading associated with body rotations are used for navigation, in the sense that the existence of periodicity implies a lack of proper alignment (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Goldstein, 2015</xref>). It is known that the PFR is directly connected with the light-sensing apparatus (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">Rosati et al., 1991</xref>), and might even be contractile (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">Piccinni, 1975</xref>). Transient light stimuli have been shown to change flagellar beat patterns. While the euglenid flagellum consistently present looping outlines (the 2d trace of a torsion dipole), its extension from the cell body changes with changing light intensity signals, resulting in a variety of 'quantized’ phototaxis behaviors (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib42">Tsang et al., 2018</xref>). With suitable modifications, our model could provide a starting point to address the (possible) mechanisms of active contraction of the PFR, light perception, and their interplay. Further study on euglenid flagellar motility and phototaxis could lead to a more comprehensive understanding of the biomechanical role of PFR, both in phototaxis and in general.</p><p>The very basic question of 'why' euglenids have evolved a structure such as PFR is an interesting challenge, but beyond the scope of the model we have developed in this paper. Our results confirm, however, the interest of euglenids as model systems for responsive unicellular organisms: <italic>E. gracilis</italic>, in particular, is a unicellular organism exhibiting a variety of motility behaviors (flagellar swimming and metaboly, see <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Leander et al., 2017</xref>) and capable of responding to a variety of stimuli, from light to confinement, see <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Noselli et al., 2019</xref>.</p></sec><sec id="s4" sec-type="materials|methods"><title>Materials and methods</title><p>Strain SAG 1224-5/27 of <italic>Euglena gracilis</italic> obtained from the SAG Culture Collection of Algae at the University of Göttingen was maintained axenic in liquid culture medium Eg.

These were performed at the Sensing and Moving Bioinspired Artifacts Laboratory of SISSA. The microscope was equipped with a LCAch 20X Phc objective (NA 0.40) for the imaging of cells trapped at the tip of a glass capillary using transmitted brightfield illumination. The intermediate magnification changer (1.6 X) of the microscope was exploited to achieve higher magnification.

At each trial, observation a glass capillary was filled with a diluted solution of cells and fixed to the microscope stage by means of a custom made, 3d-printed holder. The holder allowed for keeping the capillary in place and rotating it about its axis, so as to image a cell specimen from distinct viewpoints. Cells were immobilized at the tip of the capillary by applying a gentle suction pressure via a syringe connected to the capillary by plastic tubing. Occasionally, large body deformations of the cells were observed, a behavior commonly known as ‘metaboly’ which <italic>E. gracilis</italic> often manifest under confinement. The observations reported in this paper are restricted to specimens with immotile cell bodies, that is, in absence of metaboly. This choice allows for a clear capture of the flagellar beat. The absence of metaboly also suggests minimal impact on cell behavior in response to capillary entrapment.</p></sec></body><back><ack id="ack"><title>Acknowledgements</title><p>We thank A Beran for his assistance with <italic>E. gracilis</italic> samples.

The single emergent flagellum is held in front of the cell, where it executes a highly-3D, so-called spinning lasso beat pattern. Unusually, the euglena flagellum is flanked by a paraflagellar or para-axial rod structure, whose function is so far unknown. The authors put forward an interesting proposition (based on geometric mechanics) that a structural incompatibility between the two filaments leads to frustration and a torsional signature, consistent with the lasso. Both the static case and the hydrodynamic case were tested – the torsional feature seems to be robust to external forcing.</p><p>The reviewers found this to be a clearly written and well-explained paper that should be of interest to a wide range of researchers in various fields of biology and biophysics. While the level of mathematics is non-trivial, it is explained well within the text, and illustrated well in the figures.</p><p>Essential revisions:</p><p>1) The numbering of MTs is chosen by the authors does not appear to be consistent with published literature. This is important and worth checking carefully, in order to cross-reference any previous structural or EM studies. Usually, authors adopt a certain convention when it comes to numbering of microtubule doublets, as such systems do not exhibit perfect rotational symmetry but retain many heterogeneities – and there could be distinguished associations between certain Mts and other, non-axonemal structures such as mastigonemes.</p><p>2) According to the literature, e.g. Hyams, 1982, the PFR is hollow (Figure 3 of that paper). In contrast in <italic>T. brucei</italic> there are some longitudinal filaments and more like a lattice structure. Does this matter? The ventral flagellum also has a PFR – does this serve any purpose? Also, in euglena the rod extends all the way along the flagellum, but this is not the case in some other species. Do the authors believe that their conclusion extends across phyla, and if not, why not?</p><p>a) There is earlier work on the shape of spirochetes where a similar issue of two elastically competing structures appears: Dombrowski, et al., (2009).</p><p>The authors may wish to comment on the similarities and differences between that study and theirs.</p><p>3) In many other types of cilia and flagella which exhibit strongly non-planar beats, there is no association with a PFR-like structure, i.e. the latter is not necessary to generate non-planar bending. What's different here? Would be good to make and discuss some more cross-species comparisons (e.g. see Koyfman et al., 2011)</p><p>4) Is it clear that the rod assumes a consistent relationship with the numbered doublets? Could the rod itself be twisted around the axoneme? Authors assumed a fixed relationship and phi_p angle, and that this is neither perpendicular nor parallel to the beat plane… this is important according to Equations 25/26 (make sure to cite Melkonian, 1982 when mentioning the phi_p angle.)</p><p>5) In order to test their hypothesis the authors implemented a <italic>Chlamydomonas</italic> like planar beat pattern for dynein actuation, and determined the mismatch between the rod and axoneme… however, why could the naked axonemal beat not be 3D in the first place? Is there any structural evidence (as exists in <italic>Chlamydomonas</italic>) which suggests that the euglena beat is planar?</p><p>6) The authors have also assumed that the PFR, together with the AX_PFR linkages are passive. We suspect this is not the case. The fact that the PFR can be digested easily by trypsin suggests it may be contractile. The question is then could this structure participate in phototaxis – what is known about how the beat pattern changes during phototaxis – could the PFR actively enable a faster change in beat pattern or even beat frequency – via active contraction say, upon perception of photic signals? This could potentially be testable in the model.</p><p>7) Finally, the para-axial rod could also provide or promote a number of other functions, for instance gliding motility.

This is important and worth checking carefully, in order to cross-reference any previous structural or EM studies. Usually, authors adopt a certain convention when it comes to numbering of microtubule doublets, as such systems do not exhibit perfect rotational symmetry but retain many heterogeneities – and there could be distinguished associations between certain Mts and other, non-axonemal structures such as mastigonemes.</p></disp-quote><p>We have changed the numbering of MTs to make it consistent with published literature on <italic>E. gracilis</italic> EM studies. Specifically, we adopted the numbering convention of Melkonian et al., (1982) and Bouck et al., (1990). MT 1 is defined as the doublet with the most prominent attachment to the PFR. In this convention, MTs’ numbering increases in the clockwise direction when seen from the distal end of the Ax. This is at odds with the MTs’ labelling typically used in structural studies of cilia (which is the one we adopted in the first submission of our paper). In the typical case, MTs’ numbering increases in the anti-clockwise direction when seen from the distal end of the Ax. Dynein arms extend from MT N and reach MT N+1. In the convention adopted in this revised version of our manuscript, dynein arms extend from MT N and reach MT N-1, as in Figure 14 in Melkonian et al., (1982) and Figure 2 in Bouck et al., (1990).</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>2) According to the literature, e.g. Hyams, 1982, the PFR is hollow (Figure 3 of that paper). In contrast in <italic>T. brucei</italic> there are some longitudinal filaments and more like a lattice structure. Does this matter? The ventral flagellum also has a PFR – does this serve any purpose? Also, in euglena the rod extends all the way along the flagellum, but this is not the case in some other species. Do the authors believe that their conclusion extends across phyla, and if not, why not?</p></disp-quote><p>Our model for the PFR as a homogeneous elastic rod does not capture the level of detail that the reviewer is aiming for. We consider it as an “effective' coarse-grained model giving a fair first approximation of the forces of elastic origin that the PFR is subject to and transmits to the Ax. Through a suitable choice of geometric and material parameters, it can be used to model both hollow structures and structures with a dense core. Therefore, we believe that our conclusions are robust even against uncertainty of *some* structural details. See answer to no. 3 for more comments on this issue (in particular, comparisons across species).</p><p>The question about the ventral flagellum is interesting but beyond the scope of our work.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>a) There is earlier work on the shape of spirochetes where a similar issue of two elastically competing structures appears: Dombrowski, et al., (2009).</p><p>The authors may wish to comment on the similarities and differences between that study and theirs.</p></disp-quote><p>We thank the reviewers for pointing out the study by Dombrowski et al., to us. We have added it to our reference list, and commented on the similarities between the mechanism of shape-morphing in <italic>B. burgdorferi</italic> and that of flagellar beating in <italic>E. gracilis</italic>. Both mechanisms rely on mechanical “competition' between substructures, which generates frustration resulting in nontrivial shapes.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>3) In many other types of cilia and flagella which exhibit strongly non-planar beats, there is no association with a PFR-like structure, i.e. the latter is not necessary to generate non-planar bending. What's different here? Would be good to make and discuss some more cross-species comparisons (e.g. see Koyfman et al., 2011)</p></disp-quote><p>Yes, the association with a PFR-like structure is not necessary to generate non-planarity in flagella. We did not imply otherwise, but we have made this point clearer in our resubmission. Our main conclusion applies to <italic>E. gracilis</italic> specifically, where a prominent asymmetry in the PFR-Ax bonding complex is present. In our model, the PFR-Ax interaction is needed to generate the typical spinning lasso geometrical signature which defines the peculiar Euglena beating style.</p><p>In other PFR-bearing flagella, like those of <italic>Leishmania mexicana</italic> and <italic>Trypanosoma brucei</italic>, such a prominent asymmetry is lacking, see e.g. Portman and Gull, (2010). For these organisms, the angle <inline-formula><mml:math id="inf560"><mml:msup><mml:mi>ϕ</mml:mi><mml:mi>p</mml:mi></mml:msup></mml:math></inline-formula> is closer to zero, as we mentioned in our first submission. In this case, our model predicts a planar (or quasi planar) beat and this prediction is consistent with the observed behaviour of both <italic>L. mexicana</italic> and <italic>T. brucei</italic> mutants with body-detached flagellum. Following the suggestion by the reviewer, we have added a reference to Koyfman et al., (2011).</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>4) Is it clear that the rod assumes a consistent relationship with the numbered doublets? Could the rod itself be twisted around the axoneme? Authors assumed a fixed relationship and phi_p angle, and that this is neither perpendicular nor parallel to the beat plane… this is important according to Equations 25/26 (make sure to cite Melkonian, 1982 when mentioning the phi_p angle.)</p></disp-quote><p>We believe that the EM study by Melkonian et al., (1982) gives a clear answer to the question raised by the reviewer. The possibility of a systematic numbering convention of MTs strongly implies a consistent relationship between Ax and PFR. The authors define a scheme for the flagellar cross-section “based on the evaluation of 80 different cross-sections of flagella', where MTs are identified based on associations with PFR and mastigonemes. The bonding links complex is conserved through the length of the flagellum (and across flagella), and it seems hard to reconcile this observation with the possibility that the PFR was twisted around the Ax. We cited Melkonian et al., (1982) in the paper when mentioning the <inline-formula><mml:math id="inf561"><mml:msup><mml:mi>ϕ</mml:mi><mml:mi>p</mml:mi></mml:msup></mml:math></inline-formula> angle.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>5) In order to test their hypothesis the authors implemented a Chlamydomonas like planar beat pattern for dynein actuation, and determined the mismatch between the rod and axoneme… however, why could the naked axonemal beat not be 3D in the first place? Is there any structural evidence (as exists in Chlamydomonas) which suggests that the euglena beat is planar?</p></disp-quote><p>In our model the role of the PFR is twofold: it acts as (1) a MTs’ sliding inhibitor, and (2) as a mechanically antagonistic element.</p><p>The Ax-PFR bonding links play the central (structural) role in MTs’ sliding inhibition. Our working hypothesis is that MTs’ sliding stretches the bonding links. This inhibits MTs’ sliding and triggers a dynein organization (via mechanical feedback) similar to the one present in <italic>Chlamydomonas</italic> and sperm cells. However, we are not yet able to model the microscopic details of this response mechanism. We take this feedback-based self-organization process as a given, and we consider a force pattern that would produce planar beat in absence of antagonistic forces on the Ax.</p><p>The agreement of the observed flagellar shapes with the ones we predict shows that our working hypothesis is consistent with the available evidence. Further work will be needed in the future to address the issue of whether the dynein actuation pattern is truly planar and, if so, which feedback mechanisms lead to the emergence of this pattern. We have clarified this point in the revised manuscript (see subsection “Dyneins’ actuation induced by sliding inhibition').</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>6) The authors have also assumed that the PFR, together with the AX_PFR linkages are passive. We suspect this is not the case. The fact that the PFR can be digested easily by trypsin suggests it may be contractile. The question is then could this structure participate in phototaxis – what is known about how the beat pattern changes during phototaxis – could the PFR actively enable a faster change in beat pattern or even beat frequency – via active contraction say, upon perception of photic signals? This could potentially be testable in the model.</p></disp-quote><p>This is an interesting and widely open question, but we believe that the answer is highly non-trivial. The question deserves further ad-hoc study, including a large set of new experiments and a modelling effort to address the mechanisms of active contraction, light perception, and their interplay. We consider this suggestion as a very interesting direction to pursue in future studies, and we have indicated so in Discussion section.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>7) Finally, the para-axial rod could also provide or promote a number of other functions, for instance gliding motility. What do the authors think about this possibility? Or conversely, can they suggest experiments that would help show more definitively that the PFR facilities 3D swimming?</p></disp-quote><p>This is another interesting question, but we are not able to suggest an answer.</p><p>In other systems, the question of whether the paraflagellar rod is “vital' for a certain form of motility has been address with the study of mutants (see e.g., Bastin et al., 1998).Genetic editing techniques are not available to us, and we are unaware of results of this nature in the general literature on <italic>E. gracilis</italic> (possibly because its genome has not been sequenced yet).</p><p>Our experience with physical experiments on <italic>E. gracilis</italic> concerns swimming motility and metaboly, and we have no experience with gliding motility.
