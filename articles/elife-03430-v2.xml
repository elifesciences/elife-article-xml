Experimental screens have identified tens of thousands of interactions, and structural biology has provided detailed functional insight for select 3D protein complexes. An alternative rich source of information about protein interactions is the evolutionary sequence record. Building on earlier work, we show that analysis of correlated evolutionary sequence changes across proteins identifies residues that are close in space with sufficient accuracy to determine the three-dimensional structure of the protein complexes. We evaluate prediction performance in blinded tests on 76 complexes of known 3D structure, predict protein–protein contacts in 32 complexes of unknown structure, and demonstrate how evolutionary couplings can be used to distinguish between interacting and non-interacting protein pairs in a large complex. With the current growth of sequences, we expect that the method can be generalized to genome-wide elucidation of protein–protein interaction networks and used for interaction predictions at residue resolution.</p><p><bold>DOI:</bold> <ext-link ext-link-type="doi" xlink:href="10.7554/eLife.03430.001">http://dx.doi.org/10.7554/eLife.03430.001</ext-link></p></abstract><abstract abstract-type="executive-summary"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.03430.002</object-id><title>eLife digest</title><p>DNA is often referred to as the ‘blueprint of life’, as this molecule contains the instructions that are required to build a living organism from a single cell. But these instructions largely play out through the proteins that DNA encodes; and most proteins do not work alone. Instead they come together in different combinations, or complexes, and a single protein may participate in many complexes with different activities.</p><p>Proteins are so small that it is difficult to get clear information about what they look like. Visualizing protein complexes is even harder. Most protein–protein interactions remain poorly understood, even in the best-studied organisms such as humans, yeast, and bacteria.</p><p>Proteins are made from smaller molecules, called amino acids, strung together one after the other. The order in which different amino acids are arranged in a protein determines the protein’s shape and ultimately its function. Like DNA, protein sequences can change over time. Sometimes, the sequence of one protein changes in a way that prevents it binding to another protein. If these two proteins must work together for an organism to survive, the second protein will often develop a compensating change that allows the protein–protein complex to reform.</p><p>Identifying pairs of changes in the sequences of pairs of proteins suggests that the two proteins interact and gives some information about how the proteins fit together. Different species can have copies of the same proteins that have slightly different sequences. Since the DNA sequences from many different organisms are already known, there are now many opportunities to find sites in pairs of proteins that have evolved together, or co-evolved, over time.</p><p>To find sites that seem to have co-evolved, Hopf et al. used a computer program based on an approach from statistical physics to look at pairs of proteins that were already known to form complexes. Co-evolving sites were found in over 300 pairs of proteins; including 76 where the structure of the complex was already known. When sites that were predicted to be co-evolving were then mapped to these known complex structures, the co-evolving sites were remarkably close to the true protein–protein contacts. This indicates that the information from the co-evolved sequences is sufficient to show how two proteins fit together.</p><p>Hopf et al. then turned their attention to 82 pairs of proteins that were thought to interact, but where a structure was unavailable. For 32 of these pairs, structures of the entire complex could be predicted, showing how the two proteins might interact. Furthermore, when other researchers subsequently worked out the structure of one of these complexes, the prediction was a good match to the solved complex structure.</p><p>The machinery of life is largely made up of proteins, which must interact in ever-changing but precise ways. The new methods developed by Hopf et al. provide a new way to discover and investigate the details of these interactions.</p><p><bold>DOI:</bold> <ext-link ext-link-type="doi" xlink:href="10.7554/eLife.03430.002">http://dx.doi.org/10.7554/eLife.03430.002</ext-link></p></abstract><kwd-group kwd-group-type="author-keywords"><title>Author keywords</title><kwd>co-evolution</kwd><kwd>protein</kwd><kwd>interaction</kwd></kwd-group><kwd-group kwd-group-type="research-organism"><title>Research organism</title><kwd><italic>E. coli</italic></kwd></kwd-group><funding-group><award-group id="par-1"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000057</institution-id><institution>National Institute of General Medical Sciences</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>R01 GM106303</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Hopf</surname><given-names>Thomas A</given-names></name><name><surname>Marks</surname><given-names>Debora S</given-names></name><name><surname>Sander</surname><given-names>Chris</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="par-2"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100000592</institution-id><institution>Fulbright Commission</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Schärfe</surname><given-names>Charlotta P I</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><funding-statement>The funders had no role in study design, data collection and interpretation, or the decision to submit the work for publication.</funding-statement></funding-group><custom-meta-group><custom-meta><meta-name>elife-xml-version</meta-name><meta-value>2</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta specific-use="meta-only"><meta-name>Author impact statement</meta-name><meta-value>Interactions in protein complexes can be predicted from evolutionary information from genomic sequences.</meta-value></custom-meta></custom-meta-group></article-meta></front><body><sec id="s1" sec-type="intro"><title>Introduction</title><p>A large part of biological research is concerned with the identity, dynamics, and specificity of protein interactions. There have been impressive advances in the three-dimensional (3D) structure determination of protein complexes which has been significantly extended by homology-inferred 3D models (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib43">Mosca et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib65">Webb et al., 2014</xref>) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Hart et al., 2006</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib67">Zhang et al., 2012</xref>). However, there is still little, or no, 3D information for ∼80% of the currently known protein interactions in bacteria, yeast, or human, amounting to at least ∼30,000/∼6000 incompletely characterized interactions in human and <italic>Escherichia coli,</italic> respectively (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib43">Mosca et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib51">Rajagopala et al., 2014</xref>). With the rapid rise in our knowledge of genetic variation at the sequence level, there is an increased interest in linking sequence changes to changes in molecular interactions, but current experimental methods cannot match the increase in the demand for residue-level information of these interactions. One way to address the knowledge gap of protein interactions has been the use of hybrid, computational–experimental approaches that typically combine 3D structural information at varying resolutions, homology models, and other methods (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">de Juan et al., 2013</xref>), with force field-based approaches such as RosettaDock, residue cross-linking, and data-driven approaches that incorporate various sources of biological information (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">Kortemme and Baker, 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Dominguez et al., 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">Kortemme and Baker, 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Kortemme et al., 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib60">Svensson et al., 2004</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Chaudhury et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib56">Schneidman-Duhovny et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib63">Velazquez-Muriel et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Karaca and Bonvin, 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib54">Rodrigues et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib65">Webb et al., 2014</xref>). However, most of these approaches depend on the availability of prior knowledge and many biologically relevant systems remain out of reach, as additional experimental information is sparse (e.g., membrane proteins, transient interactions, and large complexes). One promising computational approach is to use evolutionary analysis of amino acid co-variation to identify close residue contacts across protein interactions, which was first used 20 years ago (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Gobel et al., 1994</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib47">Pazos and Valencia, 2001</xref>), and subsequently used also to identify protein interactions (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib49">Pazos et al., 1997</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib48">Pazos and Valencia, 2002</xref>). Others have used some evolutionary information to improve a machine learning approach to developing docking potentials (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Faure et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Andreani et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Andreani and Guerois, 2014</xref>). These previous approaches relied on a local model of co-evolution that is less likely to disentangle indirect and therefore incorrect correlations from the direct co-evolution, as has been described in work on residue–residue interactions in single proteins (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib40">Marks et al., 2012</xref>). More recently, reports using a global model have been successful in identifying residue interactions from evolutionary co-variation, for instance between histidine kinases and response regulators (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Burger &amp; van Nimwegen, 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib59">Skerker et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib66">Weigt et al., 2009</xref>), and this approach has only recently been generalized and used to predict contacts between proteins in complexes of unknown structure, in an independent effort parallel to this work (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib45">Ovchinnikov et al., 2014</xref>). In principle, just a small number of key residue–residue contacts across a protein interface would allow computation of 3D models and provide a powerful, orthogonal approach to experiments.</p><p>Since the recent demonstration of the use of evolutionary couplings (ECs) between residues to determine the 3D structure of individual proteins (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">Marks et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib42">Morcos et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Aurell and Ekeberg, 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Jones et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Kamisetty et al., 2013</xref>), including integral membrane proteins (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Hopf et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib44">Nugent and Jones, 2012</xref>), we reason that an evolutionary statistical approach such as EVcouplings (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">Marks et al., 2011</xref>) could be used to determine co-evolved residues <italic>between</italic> proteins. To assess this hypothesis, we built an evaluation set based on all known binary protein interactions in <italic>E. coli</italic> that have 3D structures of the complex as recently summarized (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib51">Rajagopala et al., 2014</xref>). We develop a score for every predicted inter-protein residue pair based on the overall inter-protein EC score distributions resulting in accurate predictions for the majority of top ranked <italic>inter</italic>-protein EC pairs (inter-ECs) and sufficient to calculate accurate 3D models of the complexes in the docked subset (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1A</xref>). This approach was then used to predict evolutionary couplings for 32 complexes of unknown 3D structures that have a sufficient number of sequences. Predictions include the structurally unsolved interactions between the a-, b-, and c-subunits of ATP synthase, which are supported by previously published experimental results.<fig-group><fig id="fig1" position="float"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.03430.003</object-id><label>Figure 1.</label><caption><title>Co-evolution of residues across protein complexes from the evolutionary sequence record.</title><p>(<bold>A</bold>) Evolutionary pressure to maintain protein–protein interactions leads to the co-evolution of residues between interacting proteins in a complex. By analyzing patterns of amino acid co-variation in an alignment of putatively interacting homologous proteins (left), evolutionary couplings between co-evolving inter-protein residue pairs can be identified (middle).

Without this condition, proteins could be paired together that do not in fact interact with each other and therefore detection of co-evolution would be compromised. Given that the evolutionary couplings method depends on large numbers of diverse sequences (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Hopf et al., 2012</xref>), some assumption must be made about which proteins interact with each other in homologous sequences in other species. Since it is challenging to know a priori whether particular interactions are conserved across many millions of years in thousands of different organisms, we use proximity of the two interacting partners on the genome as a proxy for this, with the goal of reducing incorrect pairings.</p><p>To assemble the broadest possible data sets to test the approach and make predictions, we take all known interacting proteins assembled in a published data set that contains ∼3500 high-confidence protein interactions in <italic>E. coli</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib51">Rajagopala et al., 2014</xref>). After removing redundancy and requiring close genome distance between the pairs of proteins this results in 326 interactions, see ‘Materials and methods’ (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1B</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1</xref>, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1-data SD2-data">Supplementary file 1 and 2</xref>),</p><p>The paired sequences are concatenated and statistical co-evolution analysis is performed using EVcouplings (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">Marks et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib42">Morcos et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Aurell and Ekeberg, 2012</xref>), that applies a pseudolikelihood maximization (PLM) approximation to determine the interaction parameters in the underlying maximum entropy probability model (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Balakrishnan et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Ekeberg et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Kamisetty et al., 2013</xref>), simultaneously generating both intra- and inter-EC scores for all pairs of residues within and across the protein pairs (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1A</xref>). Evolutionary coupling calculations in previous work have indicated that this global probability model approach requires a minimum number of sequences in the alignment with at least 1 non-redundant sequence per residue (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">Marks et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib42">Morcos et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Hopf et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Jones et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Kamisetty et al., 2013</xref>). Our current approach allows complexes with fewer available sequences to be assessed (minimum at 0.3 non-redundant sequences per residue) by using a new quality assessment score to assess the likelihood of the predicted contacts to be correct. The EVcomplex score is based on the knowledge that most pairs of residues are not coupled and true pair couplings are outliers in the high-scoring tail of the distribution (See ‘Materials and methods’, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2A,B</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s1 fig2s2">Figure 2—figure supplement 1 and 2</xref>). The score can intuitively be understood as the distance from the noisy background of non-significant pair scores, normalized by the number of non-redundant sequences and the length of the protein (‘Materials and methods’, <xref ref-type="disp-formula" rid="equ1">equations 1</xref> and <xref ref-type="disp-formula" rid="equ2">2</xref>). If the number of sequences per residue is not controlled for, there is a large bias in the results, overestimating performance with low numbers of sequences (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2B,C</xref>). The precise functional form of the correction for low numbers of sequences was chosen non-blindly after observing the dependencies in the test set.<fig-group><fig id="fig2" position="float"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.03430.005</object-id><label>Figure 2.</label><caption><title>Evolutionary couplings capture interacting residues in protein complexes.</title><p>(<bold>A</bold>) Inter- and Intra-EC pairs with high coupling scores largely correspond to proximal pairs in 3D, but only if they lie above the background level of the coupling score distribution. To estimate this background noise a symmetric range around 0 is considered with the width being defined by the minimum inter-EC score. For the protein complexes in the evaluation set, this distribution is compared to the distance in the known 3D structure of the complex that is shown here for the methionine transporter complex, MetNI. (Plots for all complexes in the evaluation set are shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s1 fig2s2">Figure 2—figure supplement 1 and 2</xref>.) (<bold>B</bold>) A larger distance from the background noise (ratio of EC score over background noise line) gives more accurate contacts. Additionally, the higher the number of sequences in the alignment the more reliable the inferred coupling pairs are which then reduces the required distance from noise (different shades of blue). Residue pairs with an 8 Å minimum atom distance between the residues are defined as true positive contacts, and precision = TP/(TP + FP). The plot is limited to range (0,3) which excludes the histidine kinase—response regulator complex (HK–RR)—a single outlier with extremely high number of sequences. (<bold>C</bold>) To allow the comparison across protein complexes and to estimate the average inter-EC precision for a given score threshold independent of sequence numbers, the raw couplings score is normalized for the number of sequences in the alignment, resulting in the EVcomplex score. In this work, inter-ECs with an EVcomplex score ≥0.8 are used. Note: the shown plot is cut off at a score of 2 in order to zoom in on the phase change region and the high sequence coverage outlier HK-RR is excluded. (<bold>D</bold>) For complexes in the benchmark set, inter-EC pairs with EVcomplex score ≥0.8 give predictions of interacting residue pairs between the complex subunits to varying accuracy (8 Å TP distance cutoff). All predicted interacting residues for complexes in the benchmark set that had at least one inter-EC above 0.8 are shown as contact maps in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s3 fig2s4 fig2s5 fig2s6 fig2s7 fig2s8">Figure 2—figure supplement 3–8</xref>.</p><p><bold>DOI:</bold> <ext-link ext-link-type="doi" xlink:href="10.7554/eLife.03430.005">http://dx.doi.org/10.7554/eLife.03430.005</ext-link></p></caption><graphic xlink:href="elife-03430-fig2-v2.tif"/></fig><fig id="fig2s1" position="float" specific-use="child-fig"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.03430.006</object-id><label>Figure 2—figure supplement 1.</label><caption><title>Distribution and accuracy of raw EC scores for all complexes in evaluation set.</title><p><bold>DOI:</bold> <ext-link ext-link-type="doi" xlink:href="10.7554/eLife.03430.006">http://dx.doi.org/10.7554/eLife.03430.006</ext-link></p></caption><graphic xlink:href="elife-03430-fig2-figsupp1-v2.tif"/></fig><fig id="fig2s2" position="float" specific-use="child-fig"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.03430.007</object-id><label>Figure 2—figure supplement 2.</label><caption><title>Distribution and accuracy of raw EC scores for all complexes in evaluation set (2).</title><p><bold>DOI:</bold> <ext-link ext-link-type="doi" xlink:href="10.7554/eLife.03430.007">http://dx.doi.org/10.7554/eLife.03430.007</ext-link></p></caption><graphic xlink:href="elife-03430-fig2-figsupp2-v2.tif"/></fig><fig id="fig2s3" position="float" specific-use="child-fig"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.03430.008</object-id><label>Figure 2—figure supplement 3.</label><caption><title>Contact maps of all complexes with solved 3D structure with inter-ECs above EVcomplex score of 0.8.</title><p>Predicted coevolving residue pairs with an EVcomplex score ≥0.8 and all inter-ECs up to the rank of the last include inter-EC are visualized in complex contact maps (red dots: inter-ECs, green and blue dots: intra-ECs for monomer 1 and 2, respectively).

The relationship between the EVcomplex score and the precision of the corresponding inter-protein ECs suggests that on average 74% (69%) of the predicted pairs with EVcomplex score greater than 0.8 will be accurate to within 10 Å (8 Å) of an experimental structure of the complex (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2C</xref>). Most complexes have at least one inter-protein predicted contact above the selected score threshold of 0.8 (53/76 complexes). Three complexes have more than 20 predicted inter-protein residue contacts which are over 80% accurate, namely the histidine kinase and response regulator system (78 residue pairs), t-RNA synthetase (32 residue pairs), and the vitamin B importer complex (21 residue pairs), with precision over 80% (complex numbers 330, 019, 130 respectively, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2D</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s3 fig2s4 fig2s5 fig2s6 fig2s7 fig2s8">Figure 2—figure supplements 3–8</xref>, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD1-data">Supplementary file 1</xref>).</p><p>We suggest that users of EVcomplex consider predicted contacts that lie below the threshold of 0.8 in the context of other biological knowledge, where available, or in comparison to other higher scoring contacts for the same complex. In this way additional true positive inter-residue contacts can be distinguished from false positives. For instance, the ethanolamine ammonia-lyase complex (complex 065) has only 3 predicted inter-protein residue pairs above the score threshold, but in fact has 5 additional correct pairs with EVcomplex scores slightly below the threshold of 0.8 which cluster with the 3 high-scoring contacts on the monomers, indicating that they are also correct.</p><p>Some of the high confidence inter-protein ECs in the test set are not close in 3D space when compared to their known 3D structures. These false positives may be a result of assumptions in the method that are not always correct. This includes (1) the assumption that the interaction between paired proteins is conserved across species and across paralogs, and (2) that truly co-evolved residues across proteins are indeed always close in 3D, which is not always the case. In addition, the complexes may also exist in alternative conformations that have not necessarily all been captured yet by crystal or NMR structures, for instance in the case of the large conformational changes of the BtuCDF complex (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Hvorup et al., 2007</xref>).</p></sec><sec id="s2-2-2"><title>Docking is accurate with few pairs of predicted contacts</title><p>To test whether the computed inter-protein ECs are sufficient for obtaining accurate 3D structures of the whole complex, we selected 15 diverse examples (with 5 or more inter-protein residue contacts) for docking (<xref ref-type="table" rid="tbl1">Table 1</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s1">Figure 3—figure supplement 1</xref>, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD3-data">Supplementary file 3</xref>) with HADDOCK (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Dominguez et al., 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">de Vries et al., 2007</xref>). The docking procedure is fast and generates 100 3D models of each complex using all residue pairs with EVcomplex scores above the selection threshold. We additionally dock negative controls to assess the amount of information added to the docking protocol by evolutionary couplings (500 models per run, no constraints other than center of mass, see ‘Materials and methods’). The best models for all 15 complexes docked with evolutionary couplings have interface RMSDs under 6 Å, 12/15 have the best scoring model under 4 Å and the top ranked models for 11/15 are under 5 Å backbone interface RMSD compared to a crystal or NMR structure interface. Over 70% of the generated models are close to the experimental structures of the complexes (&lt;4 Å backbone iRMSD), compared to less than 0.5% in the controls (and these were not high–ranked) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s1">Figure 3—figure supplement 1</xref>, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD3-data">Supplementary file 3</xref>, ‘Supplementary data’). Not surprisingly complexes that have the largest numbers of true positive predicted contacts perform the best when docking. For example, the ribosomal proteins RS3 and RS14 have 11 true positive inter-protein ECs and result in a top ranked model only 1.1 Å iRMSD from the reference structure. More surprisingly, other complexes with a lower proportion of true positive inter-protein contacts, such as Ubiquinol oxidase (6 out of 11) or the epsilon and gamma subunits of ATP synthase (8 out of 15) also produced accurate predicted complexes, with an iRMSD of 1.8 and 1.4 Å respectively. The docking experiments therefore demonstrate that inter-protein ECs, even in the presence of incorrect predictions, can be sufficient to give accurate 3D models of protein complexes, but more work will be needed to quantify the likelihood of successful docking from the predicted contacts.<table-wrap id="tbl1" position="float"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.03430.014</object-id><label>Table 1.</label><caption><p>EVcomplex predictions and docking results for 15 protein complexes</p><p><bold>DOI:</bold> <ext-link ext-link-type="doi" xlink:href="10.7554/eLife.03430.014">http://dx.doi.org/10.7554/eLife.03430.014</ext-link></p></caption><table frame="hsides" rules="groups"><thead><tr><th/><th/><th colspan="3">EVcomplex contacts</th><th colspan="2">Docking quality (iRMSD)</th></tr><tr><th>Complex name</th><th>Subunits</th><th>Seqs<xref ref-type="table-fn" rid="tblfn1">†</xref></th><th>ECs<xref ref-type="table-fn" rid="tblfn2">‡</xref></th><th>TP rate<xref ref-type="table-fn" rid="tblfn3">§</xref></th><th>Top ranked model<xref ref-type="table-fn" rid="tblfn4">#</xref></th><th>Best model<xref ref-type="table-fn" rid="tblfn5">¶</xref></th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td>Carbamoyl-phosphate synthase</td><td>CarB:CarA</td><td>2.3</td><td>17</td><td>0.88</td><td>1.9</td><td>1.9</td></tr><tr><td>Aminomethyltransferase/Glycine cleavage system H protein</td><td>GcsH:GcsT</td><td>2.9</td><td>5</td><td>0.2</td><td>5.4</td><td>5.4</td></tr><tr><td>Histidine kinase/response regulator</td><td>KdpD:CheY (T. maritima)</td><td>95.4</td><td>78</td><td>0.72</td><td>2.1</td><td>2.0</td></tr><tr><td>Ubiquinol oxidase</td><td>CyoB:CyoA</td><td>1.0</td><td>11</td><td>0.55</td><td>1.8</td><td>1.2</td></tr><tr><td>Outer membrane usher protein/Chaperone protein</td><td>FimD:FimC</td><td>3.6</td><td>6</td><td>0.83</td><td>3.2</td><td>3.0</td></tr><tr><td>Molybdopterin synthase</td><td>MoaD:MoaE</td><td>3.6</td><td>8</td><td>1.0</td><td>4.4</td><td>4.1</td></tr><tr><td>Methionine transporter complex</td><td>MetN:MetI</td><td>1.9</td><td>14</td><td>0.86</td><td>1.5</td><td>1.2</td></tr><tr><td>Dihydroxyacetone kinase</td><td>DhaL:DhaK</td><td>1.4</td><td>12</td><td>0.42</td><td>6.7</td><td>2.4</td></tr><tr><td>Vitamin B12 uptake system</td><td>BtuC:BtuF</td><td>3.2</td><td>5</td><td>0.6</td><td>2.8</td><td>2.8</td></tr><tr><td>Vitamin B12 uptake system</td><td>BtuC:BtuD</td><td>9.8</td><td>21</td><td>0.88</td><td>1.1</td><td>0.9</td></tr><tr><td>ATP synthase γ and ε subunits</td><td>AtpE:AtpG</td><td>2.9</td><td>15</td><td>0.53</td><td>1.4</td><td>1.4</td></tr><tr><td>IIA-IIB complex of the N,N'-diacetylchitobiose (Chb) transporter</td><td>PtqA:PtqB</td><td>3.1</td><td>5</td><td>0.2</td><td>7.2</td><td>5.5</td></tr><tr><td>30 S Ribosomal proteins</td><td>RS3:RS14</td><td>1.4</td><td>11</td><td>0.91</td><td>1.1</td><td>1.1</td></tr><tr><td>Succinatequinone oxido-reductase flavoprotein/iron-sulfur subunits</td><td>SdhB:SdhA</td><td>3.0</td><td>8</td><td>0.62</td><td>1.4</td><td>1.4</td></tr><tr><td>30 S Ribosomal proteins</td><td>RS10:RS14</td><td>1.2</td><td>6</td><td>1.0</td><td>5.3</td><td>2.5</td></tr></tbody></table><table-wrap-foot><fn id="tblfn1"><label>†</label><p>Number of non-redundant sequences in concatenated alignment normalized by alignment length.</p></fn><fn id="tblfn2"><label>‡</label><p>Inter-ECs with EVcomplex score ≥0.8.</p></fn><fn id="tblfn3"><label>§</label><p>True Positive rate for inter-ECs above score threshold.</p></fn><fn id="tblfn4"><label>#</label><p>iRMSD positional deviation of model from known structure, for docked model with best HADDOCK score.</p></fn><fn id="tblfn5"><label>¶</label><p>Lowest iRMSD observed across all models.</p></fn></table-wrap-foot></table-wrap><fig-group><fig id="fig3" position="float"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.03430.015</object-id><label>Figure 3.</label><caption><title>Blinded prediction of evolutionary couplings between complex subunits with known 3D structure.</title><p>Inter-ECs with EVcomplex score ≥0.8 on a selection of benchmark complexes (monomer subunits in green and blue, inter-ECs in red, pairs closer than 8 Å by solid red lines, dashed otherwise).

Using the default EVcomplex score threshold of 0.8 to discriminate between interacting and non-interacting pairs of subunits, 24 of the 28 possible interactions between the subunits are correctly classified as interacting or non-interacting. The four incorrect predictions (namely: ε and c, γ and c, ε and β, b and β, for which there is some experimental evidence) are not identified as interacting using the 0.8 EVcomplex threshold. Choosing a threshold lower than 0.8 does identify 2 of these as interacting but also introduces new false positives. The ε and β interaction in the crystal structure 3oaa (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Cingolani and Duncan, 2011</xref>) is a special case in that it involves a highly extended conformation of the last two helices of the ε subunit that reach up into the enzyme making contacts with the β subunit.

In total 80% of the interacting residue pairs in the known 3D structure parts of the synthase complex (7 pairs of subunits) are correctly predicted (threshold: 10 Å minimum atom distance between two residues).

If a protein interaction is conserved across enough sequenced genomes, using a single pair per genome can give accurate predictions of the interacting residues. However, if the protein pair is present in limited taxonomic branches, there may be insufficient sequences at any given time to make confident predictions. A solution to this could be to include multiple paralogs of the interacting proteins from each genome, but this requires correct pairing of the interaction partners, which is in general hard to ascertain. In addition, details of interactions may have diverged for paralogous pairs. Hence, in this current version of the method, we have imposed a genome distance requirement across all genomes for all homolog pairs in order to be less sensitive to these complications.</p><p>As the need to use genome proximity to pair sequences becomes less important with the increasing availability of genome sequences, there will be a dramatic increase in the number of interactions that can be inferred from evolutionary couplings, including those unique to eukaryotes. With currently available sequences (May 2014 release of the UniProt database), EVcomplex is able to provide information for about 1/10<sup>th</sup> of the known 3000 protein interactions in the <italic>E. coli</italic> genome. Once there are ∼10,000 bacterial genome sequences of sufficient diversity, one would have enough information to test each potentially interacting pair of homologs for evidence of interaction and, given sufficiently strong evolutionary couplings, infer the 3D structure of each protein–protein pair, as well as of complexes with more than two proteins. For any set of species, e.g., vertebrates or mammals, one can imagine guiding sequencing efforts to optimize species diversity to facilitate the extraction of evolutionary couplings. This can open the doors for more comprehensive and more rapid determination of approximate 3D structures of proteins and protein complexes, as well as for the elucidation in molecular detail of the most strongly evolutionarily constrained interactions, pointing to functional interactions.</p><p>Determining the three-dimensional models of complexes from the predicted contacts was successful in many of the tested instances. Using minimal computing resources and a small number of inter-EC-derived contacts, low interface positional RMSDs relative to experimental structures can be achieved. However, a significant number of proteins exist as homomultimers within larger complexes. To determine models of these complexes one must deconvolute homomultimeric inter-ECs from the intra-protein signal, which is an important technical challenge for future work.</p><p>The analysis of subunit interactions in ATP synthase in this work is a ‘proof of principle’ study showing that methods such as EVcomplex can determine which proteins interact with each other at the same time as specific residue pair couplings across the proteins (as also shown in the work by the Baker lab on ribosomal protein interactions (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib45">Ovchinnikov et al., 2014</xref>)). Understanding the networks of protein interactions is of critical interest in eukaryotic systems, such as networks of protein kinases, GPCRs, or PDZ domain proteins. An understanding of the distributions of interaction specificities is of high interest to many fields. Although we do not know how well our evolutionary coupling approach will handle less obligate interactions, results on the two-component signaling system (histidine kinase/response regulator) both here and in other work (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib59">Skerker et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib66">Weigt et al., 2009</xref>) suggest optimism.</p><p>The approximately scale-free EVcomplex score is a heuristic based on the distribution of raw EC scores from the statistical model, their dependence on sequence alignment depth and the length of the concatenated sequences. The score provides a simple way of accounting for these dependencies such that a uniform threshold, say 0.8, can be used for any protein pair with the expectation of reasonably accurate predictions. Since cutoff thresholds can be useful but overly sharp, we recommend investigating predicted contacts below the threshold used in this work, especially where there is independent biological knowledge to validate the predictions.</p><p>The work presented here is in anticipation of a genome-wide exploration and, as a proof of principle, shows the accurate prediction of inter-protein contacts in many cases and their utility for the computation of 3D structures across diverse complex interfaces. As with single protein (intra-EC) predictions, evolutionarily conserved conformational flexibility and oligomerization can result in more than one set of contacts that must be de-convoluted. Can evolutionary information help to predict the details and extent for each complex? A key challenge will be the development of algorithms that can disentangle evolutionary signals caused by alternative conformations of single complexes, alternative conformations of homologous complexes, and effectively deal with false positive signals. Taken together, these issues highlight fruitful areas for future development of evolutionary coupling methods.</p><p>Despite conditions for the successful de novo calculation of co-evolved residues, the method described here may accelerate the exploration of the protein–protein interaction world and the determination of protein complexes on a genome-wide scale at residue level resolution. The use of co-evolutionary analysis in computational models to determine protein specificity and promiscuity, co-evolutionary dynamics and functional drift will open up exciting future research questions.</p></sec><sec id="s4" sec-type="materials|methods"><title>Materials and methods</title><sec id="s4-1"><title>Selection of interacting protein pairs for co-evolution calculation</title><p>The candidate set of complexes for testing and de novo prediction was derived starting from a data set of binary protein–protein interactions in <italic>E. coli</italic> including yeast two-hybrid experiments, literature-curated interactions and 3D complex structures in the PDB (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib51">Rajagopala et al., 2014</xref>).

Since we want to compare the computational predictions to some ‘ground truth’, as with the complexes for the rest of the manuscript, we used known 3D structures of the ATP synthase complex to assign whether or not the subunits interact (PDB: 3oaa, 1fs0, 2a7u; <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD7-data">Supplementary file 7</xref>). Since we are also determining whether the subunits interact, not necessarily knowing full atomic detail residue interactions, we included subunit interactions that have been inferred from cryo-EM, crosslinking or other experiments, but do not necessarily have a crystal structure. These are represented as solid blue boxes, if the interaction is well established (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">DeLeon-Rangel et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib57">Schulenberg et al., 1999</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Brandt et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib41">McLachlin and Dunn, 2000</xref>), or crosshatched blue if there is a lack of consensus in the community (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6B</xref>, left panel).</p><p>For each possible interaction the EVcomplex score of the highest ranked inter-EC was considered as a proxy for the likelihood of interaction.

Proteins that have been crystallized together in a complex could bias the results of the docking, as they have complementary positions of the surface side chains. Therefore, where possible we used complexes that had a solved 3D structure of the unbound monomer, namely GcsH/GcsT, CyoA, FimC, DhaL, AtpE, PtqA/PtqB, RS10, and HK/RR, and in all other cases the side chains of the monomers were randomized either by using SCWRL4 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">Krivov et al., 2009</xref>) or restrained minimization with Schrodinger Protein Preparation Wizard (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib55">Sastry et al., 2013</xref>) before docking. For ubiquinol oxidase (complex_054) the unbound structure of subunit 2 (CyoA) only covers the COX2 domain.

All other parameters were left as the default values in the HADDOCK protocol. Each protein complex was run using predicted ECs as unambiguous distance restraints on the Cα atoms (d<sub>eff</sub> 5 Å, upper bound 2 Å, lower bound 2 Å; input files available in ‘Supplementary data’). As a negative control, each protein complex was also docked using center of mass restraints alone (ab initio docking mode of HADDOCK) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">de Vries et al., 2007</xref>) and in this case generating 10,000/500/500 models.</p><p>Each of the generated models is scored using a weighted sum of electrostatic (E<sub>elec</sub>) and van der Waals (E<sub>vdw</sub>) energies complemented by an empirical desolvation energy term (E<sub>desolv</sub>) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Fernandez-Recio et al., 2004</xref>). The distance restraint energy term was explicitly removed from the equation in the last iteration (Edist3 = 0.0) to enable comparison of the scores between the runs that used a different number of ECs as distance restraints.</p></sec><sec id="s4-7"><title>Comparison of predicted to experimental structures</title><p>All computed models in the docked set were compared to the cognate crystal structures by the RMSD of all backbone atoms at the interface of the complex using ProFit v.3.1 (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://www.bioinf.org.uk/software/profit/">http://www.bioinf.org.uk/software/profit/</ext-link>). The interface is defined as the set of all residues that contain any atom &lt;6 Å away from any atom of the complex partner. For the AtpE–AtpG complex, we excluded the 2 C-terminal helices of AtpE as these helices are mobile and take many different positions relative to other ATP synthase subunits (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Cingolani and Duncan, 2011</xref>). Similarly, since the DHp domain of histidine kinases can take different positions relative to the CA domain, the HK-RR complex was compared over the interface between the DHp domain alone and the response regulator partner. In the case of the unbound ubiquinol oxidase docking results, only the interface between COX2 in subunit 2 and subunit 1 was considered. Accuracy of the computed models with EC restraints was compared with computed models with center of mass restraints alone (negative controls) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3s1">Figure 3—figure supplement 1</xref>, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD3-data">Supplementary file 3</xref>).</p><p>Data analysis was conducted primarily using IPython notebooks (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib50">Perez and Granger, 2007</xref>).

The described computational approach (using sequence co-evolution to predict contacts between interacting proteins and to generate three-dimensional models of complex structures) appears to be quite successful and is an important contribution that is of interest to a broad audience. The analyses, results, and conclusions are similar to work conducted during the same period by Baker &amp; coworkers, published recently in <italic>eLife.</italic> Nevertheless, it is the consensus opinion of the reviewers that the present manuscript is potentially suitable for publication in <italic>eLife</italic> as well, provided that all of the comments raised by the reviewers can be addressed satisfactorily.</p><p>We have appended the comments from the three reviewers below. Although many individual points are raised, you will see that the principal concern of the reviewers is that the manuscript falls short of providing the reader with sufficient analysis to judge the validity of the conclusions. It should be possible for you to revise the manuscript to address these concerns without much in the way of new calculations, so we hope that it should be relatively straightforward to deal with these issues.</p><p>In addition, since the Baker paper came out recently, it should be given appropriate credit in a revised version. We recommend removing the word “new” from the manuscript for this reason, and instead simply state what was done.</p><p><italic>Reviewer 1:</italic></p><p>1) The Abstract claims that the authors' approach can discriminate between interacting and non-interacting proteins. However, as far as I can see, the rest of the paper concerns only calculating the interface residues of proteins which are known to interact. No evidence is presented to support the claim to be able to calculate non-interactors. The authors' claim should be corrected accordingly.</p><p>2) The authors claim that the co-evolutionary approach has not previously been applied to prediction of protein-protein interfaces. This is incorrect, as the authors seem to be unaware of the previous work of Raphael Guerois' group, which seems rather surprising. The authors should acknowledge the prior work of Faure et al (2012) and Andreani et al. (2013), and they should modify their claim to novelty accordingly. It would also be appropriate to cite properly the prior work of the Baker group (Ovchinnikov et al., 2014) in the same paragraph (the authors currently mention this work only as a “note added during submission”), and the recent review by Andreani and Guerois (2014).</p><p>3) In several places the authors say that their approach exploits the fact that interacting proteins are often coded close to each other in a genome. Why is this assumption necessary? According to the description given in Methods, any pair of sequences which are presumed to interact could be concatenated and then used in the authors method. Please clarify.</p><p>4) If I understand the authors’ method correctly, they first concatenate the multiple sequences of the presumed interactors, and they then use their previous approach for detecting interacting pairs of columns in the multiple alignment. In this case, when concatenating the alignments for protein “A” with those of protein “B”, the “intra-EC” pairs would appear as A-A and B-B pairs, while the “inter-EC” pairs would come from A-B or B-A interactions. My question is then, are there any observable differences in the inter and intra scores? One might expect that the conservation scores would be lower for inter interactions than intra interactions, as an interface might show more “plasticity” than the core of a domain. It would be very interesting if the authors could comment on this, preferably supported by numerical results.</p><p>5) It is incorrect for the authors to refer to their own data set as a “benchmark”. Suggestion: remove all references to the term “benchmark”. However, if the authors make all their data available in a convenient way on-line, it could be proposed as a new “benchmark”.</p><p>6) It is wrong to claim that “Experimental evidence... agrees with EVcomplex predictions” (!). Please rewrite this to say that your predictions agree with the experimental evidence. But, if this is your claim, please also support it in some way. What is the experimental evidence? How to you calculate and quantify “agrees with”?</p><p>7) Same point in the main text. “The resulting model is consistent with the topologies from cross-linking”. How do you quantify consistent?

While the main Figures / <xref ref-type="table" rid="tbl1">Table 1</xref> currently illustrate useful examples, they should also show overall analyses of the results over all cases in the benchmark datasets. In several cases this is essential to support the stated conclusions. It does not seem that this would require a substantial amount of new work or lengthy simulations, as most of the relevant data are in the Supplementary Materials (most data are in raw table format or with a separate Figure for each example, which makes it hard for the reader to gauge overall performance – this could be presented in a more easily digestible format in the main text). Specifically, I feel the paper could be substantially improved if the following points were addressed:</p><p>1) Please support the statement “Benchmark calculations here ... indicate that the number of sequences in the alignment is critical...” with a Figure showing overall performance versus # of sequences (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figure 3</xref> shows dependency of accuracy on relative rank for only two examples).</p><p>2) Show a main Figure comparing predicted contacts against residue distances in the 30 known crystal structures of complexes that had a sufficient number of sequences (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2</xref> only shows contact plots for two examples, and structural pictures for several more, but no overall quantification). This type of analysis could also help to support the statement “For the top ranked benchmark complexes, the majority of the top 5 ECs is correct to within 8A...” with a more quantitative analysis (<xref ref-type="table" rid="tbl1">Table 1</xref> only shows 7 of the 30 complexes in the dataset; <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD3-data">Supplementary file 3</xref> shows all individual contact maps, but no overall quantification).</p><p>3) “... these benchmarks show ... and demonstrate the criteria needed for successful prediction of unknown interactions”.

The comparison Table in Supplementary Figure 6 could be presented in more quantitative terms in the main text (for example, what does “crosslinking neighborhood” mean?).</p><p>5) What are the possible reasons for false-positive co-variation that does not correspond to contact?</p><p>6) The manuscript deals entirely with pairwise co-evolution, and seems to neglect the possibility of higher-order complexity in the sequence pattern.</p><p><italic>Reviewer 3:</italic></p><p>The manuscript presents an upbeat and optimistic view of the success of the method, with a relatively small amount of critical discussion and little if any investigation of what one can learn from cases in which it does not perform as expected. (For example, a list of possible reasons for false-positive co-variation that does not correspond to contact is given, but an analysis of actual instances is not.) Likewise, a set of methods is presented that is relatively particular, and the reason why these specific methods were chosen over other possibilities is not provided. Moreover, the manuscript deals entirely with pairwise co-evolution, and seems to neglect the possibility of higher-order complexity in the sequence pattern.

However, as far as I can see, the rest of the paper concerns only calculating the interface residues of proteins which are known to interact. No evidence is presented to support the claim to be able to calculate non-interactors. The authors' claim should be corrected accordingly</italic>.</p><p>We have updated the manuscript to clarify the way in which the method addresses discrimination between interacting and non-interacting proteins, and give the specific example of all against all in the ATP synthase complex. We suggest that the correct identification of interacting and non-interacting protein subunits of the ATP synthase complex could serve as a 'proof of principle' that scores derived from evolutionary couplings can identify interactions (in addition to the identification of the interacting residues between protein pairs). Since identification of the interactions of the 8 subunits of ATP synthase is the only example we report, we have been careful to talk about this as a proof of principle that may be generalized with further work (changes in Abstract, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig5">Figure 5</xref>, Materials and Methods, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD5-data">Supplementary file 5</xref>, Supplementary data). [The EV complex score identifies 24/28 of the interactions as correctly interacting or not.]</p><p><italic>2) The authors claim that the co-evolutionary approach has not previously been applied to prediction of protein-protein interfaces. This is incorrect, as the authors seem to be unaware of the previous work of Raphael Guerois' group, which seems rather surprising. The authors should acknowledge the prior work of Faure et al (2012) and Andreani et al. (2013), and they should modify their claim to novelty accordingly</italic>.</p><p><italic>It would also be appropriate to cite properly the prior work of the Baker group (Ovchinnikov et al., 2014) in the same paragraph (the authors currently mention this work only as a “note added during submission”), and the recent review by Andreani and Guerois (2014)</italic>.</p><p>We have now referred to the body of work by the Guerois group in the Introduction. We apologize for the oversight of this very interesting work. We also added more complete referencing to the work of the Valencia group; see response to reviewer 3. The Guerois group has used evolutionary information to improve their machine learnt statistical potentials. Our goal is to ask if we can we identify co-evolving residues (from sequence information alone) across proteins in order to ask whether these co-evolving pairs identify close residues, (1) whether they can be used to determine complexes in 3D and (2) whether we can use this to say if two proteins interact. Hence the approaches we present and those of the Guerois group are nicely synergistic and we hope to work with them to bring these methods together in the future.</p><p><italic>3) In several places the authors say that their approach exploits the fact that interacting proteins are often coded close to each other in a genome. Why is this assumption necessary? According to the description given in Methods, any pair of sequences which are presumed to interact could be concatenated and then used in the authors method. Please clarify</italic>.</p><p>Thanks for making it clear that we did not explain this sufficiently well. We have now clarified this in Results, Discussion, and in the Materials and methods.</p><p>To summarize: The accuracy of the co-evolutionary analysis relies on the concatenation of the protein pair representing a true interaction. This means that the contact prediction across proteins will only be as good as the input alignment pairs. When there is only one protein family member of both interacting partners in each species, one is guaranteed to get the correct alignment, assuming that it is a real complex in all organisms. Hence, subunits of ATP synthase that have only one copy in the genome, would not require this condition, and one could have simply concatenated the one pair per genome. However, for most protein interactions in <italic>E. coli</italic>, there are not yet enough sequences available to allow the use of just one pair per genome, as the complex may not necessarily occur in all bacteria. In these cases, for the time-being, our approach relies on using paralogous interactions to get sufficient sequences for instance histidine kinase; response regulators, transporters and their ATPases. Since we therefore use several paralogous interactions per complex in each genome, the algorithm requires that the partner needs to be correctly paired, something that we do not necessarily know <italic>a priori</italic>, and for which we use genome proximity as a proxy (as others have done in references 22-25). Clearly this problem will secede for many interactions in the next few years as many thousand more bacterial genomes are sequenced, but the problem is an interesting one that we think will have to be thought about in relation to eukaryotic complexes, too.</p><p><italic>4) If I understand the authors</italic>’ <italic>method correctly, they first concatenate the multiple sequences of the presumed interactors, and they then use their previous approach for detecting interacting pairs of columns in the multiple alignment. In this case, when concatenating the alignments for protein “A” with those of protein “B”, the “intra-EC” pairs would appear as A-A and B-B pairs, while the “inter-EC” pairs would come from A-B or B-A interactions. My question is then, are there any observable differences in the inter and intra scores? One might expect that the conservation scores would be lower for inter interactions than intra interactions, as an interface might show more “plasticity” than the core of a domain. It would be very interesting if the authors could comment on this, preferably supported by numerical results</italic>.</p><p>The reviewer makes a good point and one that we have now highlighted more clearly in the text. The inter-EC scores within each complex are almost universally lower than the intra–EC scores as would be expected, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s1">Figure 2–figure supplement 1</xref>.</p><p>In general we observe that the accuracy of the intra-contacts up to the rank of the first inter contact, is a good indication of how accurate the predicted inter-contacts are likely to be. This means we could have used a measure of the accuracy of the <italic>intra</italic>-protein scores to assess the predicted inter-contacts. We chose to develop a scoring method independent that did not rely on the existence of experimentally determined 3D structures of the monomers. The EV complex score implicitly considers where the inter-EC scores lie in the whole distribution instead, hence excluding those inter-ECs that lie within the noise of the whole distribution, see Materials and Methods (<xref ref-type="disp-formula" rid="equ1">equations 1</xref> and <xref ref-type="disp-formula" rid="equ2">2</xref>), <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2A</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s1">Figure 2–figure supplement 1</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2s2">Figure 2–figure supplement 2</xref>, and Supplementary data 3 “EVcomplex predictions”.</p><p><italic>5) It is incorrect for the authors to refer to their own data set as a &quot;benchmark&quot;. Suggestion: remove all references to the term &quot;benchmark&quot;. However, if the authors make all their data available in a convenient way on-line, it could be proposed as a new &quot;benchmark&quot;</italic>.</p><p>We have removed the references to the set of known 3D interactions as ‘benchmark’ and proposed this as a set the community could use in the future, as the reviewer suggests (Materials and methods).</p><p><italic>6) It is wrong to claim that &quot;Experimental evidence... agrees with EVcomplex predictions&quot; (!). Please rewrite this to say that your predictions agree with the experimental evidence. But, if this is your claim, please also support it in some way. What is the experimental evidence? How to you calculate and quantify &quot;agrees with&quot;?</italic></p><p>We have removed this sentence, and reworded this to reflect the fact we are using the experimental data to support the EC predictions and not the other way around.</p><p><italic>7) Same point in the main text. &quot;The resulting model is consistent with the topologies from cross-linking&quot;. How do you quantify consistent? RMSD from the earlier models? Please provide supporting details</italic>.</p><p>To our knowledge there are no experimentally determined atomic resolution structures of the a-subunit of ATP synthase. A 3D model of the a-subunit is from 1999 (PDB ID: 1c17) and was computed using five helical–helical interactions that were inferred from second suppressor mutation experiments, and then imposed as distance restraints for TMH2-5 [1], revealing a four helical bundle (with no information for TMH1). Later, zero-length cross-linking experiments by the Fillingame group [2] identified contacting residues from all pairs of helical combinations of TM2-TM5 (6), supporting the earlier 4 helical bundle topology. 7 of the 8 cross-linked pairs from Schwem et al., are either exactly the same pair (L120-I246) or adjacent to many pairs in the top L intra a-subunit evolutionary couplings (ECs)*, see <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Author response image 1</xref>. (Adjacent is defined as neighboring residues (±3) on chain or one helical turn.) * of ∼ L<sup>2</sup> total, see previous work and work of others for why this number is chosen.</p><p>Information from the cross-linking was not used to construct the model and no presumed membrane topology was used as input. The consistency we report is based on the correspondence between the helical-helical contacts from the experiments and evolutionary couplings together with the resulting contacts in the computed model. These can be examined in detail in the supplementary material. We have clarified this part of the analysis and provided more detail.</p><p>Reviewer 2:</p><p><italic>[…] I feel the paper could be substantially improved if the following points were addressed:</italic></p><p><italic>1) Please support the statement &quot;Benchmark calculations here ... indicate that the number of sequences in the alignment is critical...&quot; with a Figure showing overall performance versus # of sequences (</italic><xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3"><italic>Figure 3</italic></xref> <italic>shows dependency of accuracy on relative rank for only two examples)</italic>.</p><p><italic>2) Show a main Figure comparing predicted contacts against residue distances in the 30 known crystal structures of complexes that had a sufficient number of sequences (</italic><xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2"><italic>Figure 2</italic></xref> <italic>only shows contact plots for two examples, and structural pictures for several more, but no overall quantification).

The a239V- b16L cross-link is exactly one of the ECs. For 3/13 with no evidence, the proposed residue – residue contact between the subunits is consistent with the other cross-links: two are between midway on aTMH1 with midway of the membrane part of the b-subunit (aV50, aG53 with b13A), one is between aTMH3 and the N terminal end of the b-subunit (a155L, b7I) (these regions have not been tested to our knowledge). The 4<sup>th</sup> predicted EC with no cross-link support is between a66K and b68a. This EC is most likely a false positive as residue 68 in the b-subunit may be too far from the membrane surface to be plausible. Taking the body of work together from the experimental side [3-8], there are a number of specific regions of the a-subunit that are in contact with one or both of the b-monomers, and all of these regions are represented in the top evolutionary couplings; namely the first cytoplasmic loop, aTMH2, upper portion, aTMH3 and the periplasmic end of aTMH5, all of which are represented in the EVcomplex pairs (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD6-data">Supplementary file 6</xref>).</p><p>These clarifications are reflected in the main text and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="SD6-data">Supplementary file 6</xref>.</p><p>See reply to Reviewer 1 and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Author response image 1</xref> for more detail on the ECs and crosslink studies within the a-subunit.</p><p><italic>5) What are the possible reasons for false-positive co-variation that does not correspond to contact?</italic></p><p>There are two categories of false positives:</p><p>1) There is co-evolution between residues that are not close in a 3D structure.</p><p>i) This could be functional coupling – e.g. cases of information transmission through membrane proteins, allosteric signaling and indeed we have seen this anecdotally in a number of very interesting cases. The challenge is to distinguish this from other false positives.</p><p>ii) The current crystal structures do not capture all the conformations of the protein(s). This is very clear in examples such as alternating-access membrane transporters that alter their conformations substantially</p><p>2) The assumptions used for the input sequence alignments are wrong</p><p>i) The interactions in the alignments are not homologous despite sequence similarity of the component parts.</p><p>ii) The sequence diversity is insufficient to capture realistic parameters in the global model.</p><p>Deconvolution of these different causes of false positives is a critical part of future work.

The number of sequences needed for a global model such as this to determine accurate higher order covariation would be at least an order of magnitude higher than the requirement for the current method. Indeed there are insufficient sequences for many of the currently known <italic>E. coli</italic> interactions (Discussion) and see response to Reviewer 1 – comment 3. It will be interesting to see what the extent of this higher order dependence might be when enough sequences become available.</p><p>Reviewer 3:</p><p><italic>The manuscript presents an upbeat and optimistic view of the success of the method, with a relatively small amount of critical discussion and little if any investigation of what one can learn from cases in which it does not perform as expected</italic>.</p><p>We have updated the manuscript to include far more quantitative analysis, see replies to Reviewer 2 comments 1-4 above. We have also balanced the enthusiasm with a more specific description of the current limitations, that include sequence availability but also some that require algorithmic development (see Discussion). Critical discussion on the classification of false positives is now more clearly organized in the manuscript; see response to Reviewer 2, comment 5.</p><p><italic>(For example, a list of possible reasons for false-positive co-variation that does not correspond to contact is given, but an analysis of actual instances is not.) Likewise, a set of methods is presented that is relatively particular, and the reason why these specific methods were chosen over other possibilities is not provided</italic>.</p><p>There is a large body of work that has implemented other methods, both force field–based docking and other sequence based methods to explore co-variation e.g. mutual information and phylogeny to detect co-variation of residues across proteins. We have now added more discussion and references to this oeuvre in the Introduction, including new references to the body of work by the Valencia group that used correlations in multiple sequence alignments [9-10], and those suggested by Reviewer 1. Many other methods have addressed somewhat different issues, for instance, identification of interacting proteins (not residue level information), identification of residue patches rather than specific interactions, concentration on docking with hybrid approaches for known interactions or were relatively less successful (e.g. older work). For this reason it is hard to make direct comparisons. The unique aspect to this work is that it can resolve the question of interacting partners together with residue level information if the sequence diversity and space is sufficient. The EVcomplex approach, along with that of the recent work by the Baker group [11] also does this from sequences alone. Since experimentally determined structures may be a somewhat biased set of all protein interactions, our method has the advantage of not learning on known complex structures.</p><p>We look forward to the combination of the co-evolution approach together with existing computational and experimental approaches to accelerate the field.</p><p><italic>Moreover, the manuscript deals entirely with pairwise co-evolution, and seems to neglect the possibility of higher-order complexity in the sequence pattern.
