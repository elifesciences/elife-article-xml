(<italic>APOE2</italic>) benefits longevity, its mechanism is not understood. The protective effects of the <italic>APOE</italic>2 on Alzheimer’s disease (AD) risk, particularly through their effects on amyloid or tau accumulation, may confound <italic>APOE2</italic> effects on longevity. Herein, we showed that the association between <italic>APOE2</italic> and longer lifespan persisted irrespective of AD status, including its neuropathology, by analyzing clinical datasets as well as animal models. Notably, <italic>APOE2</italic> was associated with preserved activity during aging, which also associated with lifespan. In animal models, distinct apoE isoform levels, where <italic>APOE2</italic> has the highest, were correlated with activity levels, while some forms of cholesterol and triglycerides were associated with apoE and activity levels. These results indicate that <italic>APOE2</italic> can contribute to longevity independent of AD. Preserved activity would be an early-observable feature of <italic>APOE2</italic>-mediated longevity, where higher levels of apoE2 and its-associated lipid metabolism might be involved.</p></abstract><kwd-group kwd-group-type="author-keywords"><kwd>APOE</kwd><kwd>longevity</kwd><kwd>Alzheimer's disease</kwd></kwd-group><kwd-group

apolipoprotein E gene (<italic>APOE4</italic>) is a strong risk factor for late-onset Alzheimer’s disease (AD) and that <italic>APOE2</italic> is protective (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Liu et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Guo et al., 2020</xref>). Additionally, both <italic>APOE</italic> alleles are also associated with longevity. Several case-control studies have shown higher frequencies of <italic>APOE2</italic> in elderly individuals and centenarians compared to younger populations, whereas the frequency of <italic>APOE4</italic> is lower in the older individuals (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Cauley et al., 1993</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Schächter et al., 1994</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Sebastiani et al., 2019</xref>). Some longitudinal studies have also demonstrated beneficial effects of <italic>APOE2</italic> and deleterious effects of <italic>APOE4</italic> on longevity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Corder et al., 1996</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Rosvall et al., 2009</xref>). Effects of <italic>APOE</italic> on longevity have also been observed in unbiased GWAS analyses (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Deelen et al., 2011</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Nebel et al., 2011</xref>). Despite the accumulated evidence regarding <italic>APOE</italic> effects on longevity, the underlying mechanism has rarely been addressed.</p><p>ApoE proteins form lipoprotein particles and regulates lipid transport in both the central nervous systems and periphery. While apoE isoforms can directly affect Alzheimer’s neuropathology, including the accumulation of amyloid-β (Aβ) and tau, increasing evidence has demonstrated that apoE isoforms also contribute to cognitive function through AD neuropathology-independent pathways (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Liu et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">M. Di Battista et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Montagne et al., 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib43">Yamazaki et al., 2020</xref>). These effects might be mediated by apoE-regulated lipid metabolism, synaptic function, vascular integrity, and/or neuroinflammation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Liu et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">M. Di Battista et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Montagne et al., 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib43">Yamazaki et al., 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib41">Williams et al., 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Najm et al., 2019</xref>). Recently, by performing both clinical and preclinical analysis, we showed that <italic>APOE2</italic> protects against age-associated cognitive decline independent of AD neuropathology. Interestingly, these effects were also independent of synaptic and neuroinflammatory changes but associated with cholesterol metabolism in both the brain and periphery (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">Shinohara et al., 2016</xref>).</p><p>In this study, we aimed to address the effects of <italic>APOE</italic> on longevity and assess their relationship with AD, including clinical symptoms and neuropathology. Toward this, we analyzed clinical records of a large number of subjects enrolled by the National Alzheimer’s Coordinating Center (NACC). In addition, we analyzed mouse models expressing each human apoE isoform under the control of the mouse endogenous promoter (targeted replacement or ‘TR’ mice). Our results provide important insights into how <italic>APOE2</italic> contributes to longevity.</p></sec><sec id="s2" sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><sec id="s2-1"><title><italic>APOE</italic> is associated with longevity independent of AD in clinical cohorts</title><p>To evaluate relationships of each <italic>APOE</italic> allele with longevity, we analyzed NACC clinical records that collected clinical and neuropathology data of large number of demented and non-demented people in a longitudinal manner (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">Weintraub, 2009</xref>).

During their lives, we performed a non-invasive battery of behavioral tests including the open-field assay (OFA) and elevated plus maze (EPM) at both young (4–7 months age) and old (21–24 months age) ages, and rotarod test at old age (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2A</xref>). Overall, as shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2B</xref>, apoE2-TR mice showed a reduced risk of all-cause mortality when compared to apoE3-TR (p=0.0004), apoE4-TR (p=0.007), and <italic>Apoe</italic>-KO (p=0.0001). Notably, as the survival pattern for ‘control’ apoE3-TR mice varied over time, we also made pair-wise comparisons of ‘early survival’ with the apoE3-TR group by censoring all survival times at day 800. For these comparisons of ‘early survival’, we observed worse survival for apoE4-TR (p=0.013). Additionally, the median age at death was in the order of apoE2-TR (911 days)&gt;apoE3 TR (825 days)&gt;apoE4 TR (753 days)&gt;<italic>Apoe</italic> KO (738 days), where apoE4-TR mice showed ~10% decrease in median lifespan, compared to apoE3-TR mice (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2B</xref>).

As a candidate variable that might reflect the results observed in the animal experiments, we searched for ‘activity’ in NACC variables, and identified ‘dropped activities and interests’ as one component of the geriatric depression scale (GDS) test. Despite its subjective nature, previous studies suggest that this question could reflect age-related changes of some form of physical activity independent of depression (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Scheetz et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Rabaglietti et al., 2011</xref>). As these GDS components could be confounded by cognitive status, we analyzed subjects who were cognitively normal at their final GDS evaluation.

Interestingly, brain cholesterol levels were inversely correlated with apoE levels in the brain (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4J</xref>) and the activity levels in the OFA (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4K</xref>).

Because <italic>APOE2</italic> and <italic>APOE4,</italic> respectively, reduces and increases the risk of AD, there is a critical need to address whether the effects of <italic>APOE</italic> genotype on longevity are mediated through such AD risks. In this study, we uniquely combined human and mouse model studies and observed that <italic>APOE2</italic> can contribute to longevity independent of AD risks.</p><p>Although many clinical studies have observed that <italic>APOE</italic> is associated with longevity, no studies have succeeded in fully distinguishing the longevity effects of <italic>APOE</italic> from its AD effects. NACC database contains both clinical and neuropathological data of large number of AD patients as well as cognitively normal subjects with <italic>APOE</italic> genotypes. Such peculiarities of NACC database indeed allowed us to evaluate whether <italic>APOE-</italic>associated longevity is related to AD or not, including its neuropathology. While we observed significant <italic>APOE</italic> effects on mortality by adjusting cognitive status, or by stratifying AD and non-AD status, we did not observe significant <italic>APOE</italic> effects in cognitively normal individuals, although there are the same trends of difference (data not shown). One possible reason is that compared to demented subjects, there is a smaller number of death event in cognitively normal individuals in NACC database, making it difficult to assess their survival. Another possible reason is that as <italic>APOE2</italic> can also protect against age-related cognitive decline independent of AD (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">Shinohara et al., 2016</xref>), cognitive decline could be a downstream event of <italic>APOE</italic>-associated pathways related to longevity independent of AD. Longer follow-up would be necessary to address such possibilities.</p><p>To strengthen our conclusion regarding NACC clinical data analyses, we analyzed animal models without AD pathology to address human <italic>APOE2</italic> effects on longevity. While we observed significant beneficial effects of <italic>APOE2</italic> on lifespan, compared to <italic>APOE3</italic>, <italic>APOE4</italic> and <italic>Apoe</italic>-KO, we did not observe a significant difference between <italic>APOE4</italic> versus <italic>APOE3</italic> in the overall survival period (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig2">Figure 2B</xref>). Although we observed some harmful effects of <italic>APOE4</italic> on lifespan, as observed in ‘the early survival’ and median age at death, which many previous longevity studies primarily evaluate (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Ladiges et al., 2009</xref>), further studies would be needed to confirm that <italic>APOE4</italic> has indeed worse impacts on overall lifespan, compared to <italic>APOE3</italic>, as observed in clinical data. Nonetheless, this is the first study showing the effect of <italic>APOE</italic>, especially for the beneficial effects of <italic>APOE2</italic>, on longevity in animal models in the absence of amyloid or tau pathology found in AD.</p><p>While we obtained evidence that preserved activity is associated with <italic>APOE2</italic>-related longer lifespan from both clinical and animal studies, similar phenomena were indeed observed in other models of longevity. Calorie restriction, the most validated method to promote longevity in various organisms, was observed to enhance or preserve physical activity, spontaneous locomotive activity or voluntary wheel running activity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib44">Yu et al., 1985</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">Weed et al., 1997</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Bross et al., 2005</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Katewa et al., 2012</xref>). Notably, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Ingram et al., 1982</xref> observed in aged C57BL/6J mice, while exploratory activity was associated with lifespan, similar to our findings, other forms of physical activity, such as the scores of rotarod tests, were not, consistent with this study. Although it is not clear whether such kind of activity is directly involved in prolonged lifespan (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">McCarter et al., 1997</xref>), it would be a potential surrogate maker reflecting longer lifespan. Thus, it should be further investigated how longevity-associated preserved activity can be objectively evaluated in humans in addition to the subjective GDS questionnaires used in the current study.</p><p>Significant associations between the levels of activity and those of apoE protein and related lipids (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4">Figure 4</xref>) would provide important insights into <italic>APOE</italic> effects on longevity. However, the significant correlations were observed mostly by analyzing groups across <italic>APOE</italic> genotypes, not within each <italic>APOE</italic> genotype. Indeed, several positive correlations between activity levels and apoE or lipid levels disappeared after stratifying <italic>APOE</italic> genotype, while correlations between apoE and lipid levels mostly survived even after stratifying <italic>APOE</italic> genotype (data not shown). One possibility is that animal behavior scores due to individual variations (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">Shinohara et al., 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Lathe, 2004</xref>), or the time lag (~1 month) between behavior test and tissue harvesting could contribute additional variability to observe clear correlation within each genotype with limited number of mice. Another possibility is that factors other than apoE and associated lipids might be involved in <italic>APOE2</italic>-mediated longevity. Nonetheless, previous studies have shown that higher HDL-cholesterol levels in plasma are associated with longer lifespan, although effects of plasma total cholesterols were contradictory (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib40">Weverling-Rijnsburger et al., 1997</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">Upmeier et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Barzilai et al., 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Milman et al., 2013</xref>). Moreover, recent studies demonstrate that triglycerides can promote longevity in flies and yeasts (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Katewa et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Handee et al., 2016</xref>). These studies also observed that triglyceride levels are associated with more activity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Katewa et al., 2012</xref>). Thus, higher HDL-cholesterol and triglyceride levels regulated by apoE2 might both contribute to <italic>APOE2</italic>-mediated longevity although further study is necessary to confirm such findings and address the potential underlying mechanisms.</p><p>There are potential limitations of our study; regarding clinical data analysis, (1) NACC is not a population-based study, but a referral- or volunteer-based study, making it inappropriate to estimate the life expectancy of general population, (2) in NACC database, despite a longitudinal design, many participants were followed in a short period, (3) cause of death are unavailable, and (4) we did not consider all potential confounding factors associated with death, such as cancer, and impairment of vascular function (though we have adjusted for vascular pathology, and cardiovascular factors). Indeed, recent studies reported that breakdown of blood–brain barrier (BBB) plays key roles in <italic>APOE4</italic>-mediated cognitive decline, independent of AD pathology (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Montagne et al., 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Nation et al., 2019</xref>), which can be protected by <italic>APOE2</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Conejero-Goldberg et al., 2014</xref>). The possibility of involvement of such factors in <italic>APOE2</italic>-associated longevity should be addressed in future studies. Regarding a major limitation in animal experiments, we have analyzed ε2/ε2 homozygous mice that categorically develop hyperlipidemia, while only a small percentage of human ε2/ε2 carriers develop hyperlipidemia (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Sullivan et al., 1998</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Mahley et al., 1999</xref>). Though we observed such hyperlipidemia phenotype (i.e., high triglyceride levels) associated with activity levels, further investigation of <italic>APOE2</italic> effects with/without hyperlipidemia (e.g., by using ε2/ε3 animal models) should provide additional insights into how <italic>APOE2</italic> contributes to longevity.</p><p>In summary, this study provides complementary evidence from clinical and preclinical data that <italic>APOE2</italic> promotes longevity independent of AD. Our results also indicate that preserved activity during aging might be a good surrogate marker underlying <italic>APOE2</italic>-associated longevity. Moreover, our animal experiments suggest that apoE protein levels, where <italic>APOE2</italic> shows the highest, and associated lipid metabolism might play important roles in <italic>APOE2</italic>-associated longevity. As <italic>APOE2</italic> is a leading longevity gene, understanding the related mechanisms should provide critical insights into healthy living and longevity in our aging society.</p></sec><sec id="s4" sec-type="materials|methods"><title>Materials and methods</title><table-wrap id="keyresource" position="anchor"><label>Key resources table</label><table frame="hsides" rules="groups"><thead><tr><th>Reagent type <break/>(species) or resource</th><th>Designation</th><th>Source or reference</th><th>Identifiers</th><th>Additional information</th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td valign="top">Genetic reagent (<italic>Mus. musculus</italic>)</td><td valign="top"><italic>Apoe</italic><sup>tm1(APOE*2)Mae</sup> or apoE2-TR</td><td valign="top"><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Sullivan et al., 1998</xref></td><td valign="top">RRID:<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://scicrunch.org/resolver/MGI:3695702">MGI:3695702</ext-link></td><td valign="top"/></tr><tr><td valign="top">Genetic reagent (<italic>Mus. musculus</italic>)</td><td valign="top"><italic>Apoe</italic><sup>tm2(APOE*3)Mae</sup>or apoE3-TR</td><td valign="top"><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">Sullivan et al., 1997</xref></td><td valign="top">RRID:<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://scicrunch.org/resolver/MGI:3695698">MGI:3695698</ext-link></td><td valign="top"/></tr><tr><td valign="top">Genetic reagent (<italic>Mus. musculus</italic>)</td><td valign="top"><italic>Apoe</italic><sup>tm3(APOE*4)Mae</sup>or apoE4-TR</td><td valign="top"><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Knouff et al., 1999</xref></td><td valign="top">RRID:<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://scicrunch.org/resolver/MGI:4355228">MGI:4355228</ext-link></td><td valign="top"/></tr><tr><td valign="top">Genetic reagent (<italic>Mus. musculus</italic>)</td><td valign="top"><italic>Apoe</italic><sup>tm1Unc</sup> or <italic>Apoe</italic>-KO</td><td valign="top"><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Piedrahita et al., 1992</xref></td><td valign="top">RRID:<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://scicrunch.org/resolver/MGI:4358709">MGI:4358709</ext-link></td><td valign="top"/></tr><tr><td valign="top">Antibody</td><td valign="top">Goat polyclonal anti-ApoE-biotin</td><td valign="top">Meridian Life Science</td><td valign="top">Cat#: K74180B</td><td valign="top">ELISA detection (1:4000)</td></tr><tr><td valign="top">Antibody</td><td valign="top">Goat polyclonal anti-Apolipoprotein E Antibody</td><td valign="top">Millipore</td><td valign="top">Cat#: AB947</td><td valign="top">ELISA capture (1:4000)</td></tr><tr><td valign="top">Peptide, recombinant protein</td><td valign="top">ApoE3</td><td valign="top">Fitzgerald</td><td valign="top">Cat#: 30 R-2381</td><td valign="top">ELISA standard</td></tr><tr><td valign="top">Commercial assay or kit</td><td valign="top">Cholesterol E</td><td valign="top">Wako</td><td valign="top">Cat. #: 999–02601</td><td valign="top"/></tr><tr><td valign="top">Commercial assay or kit</td><td valign="top">L-Type Triglyceride M</td><td valign="top">Wako</td><td valign="top">Cat. #: 994–02891</td><td valign="top"/></tr><tr><td valign="top">Commercial assay or kit</td><td valign="top">HDL-Cholesterol E</td><td valign="top">Wako</td><td valign="top">Cat. #: 997–01301</td><td valign="top"/></tr><tr><td valign="top">Software, algorithm</td><td valign="top">SAS</td><td valign="top">SAS Institute, Inc</td><td valign="top">version 9.4</td><td valign="top"/></tr><tr><td valign="top">Software, algorithm</td><td valign="top">R Statistical Software</td><td valign="top">R Foundation for Statistical Computing</td><td valign="top">version 3.2.3</td><td valign="top"/></tr><tr><td valign="top">Software, algorithm</td><td valign="top">JMP Pro</td><td valign="top">SAS Institute, Inc</td><td valign="top">version 12</td><td valign="top"/></tr><tr><td valign="top">Software, algorithm</td><td valign="top">AnyMaze software</td><td valign="top">Stoelting Co</td><td valign="top"/><td valign="top">Animal behavior test</td></tr></tbody></table></table-wrap><sec id="s4-1"><title>Human clinical and neuropathological data</title><p>The clinical data from NACC, which were collected by the 34 past and present Alzheimer’s Disease Centers (ADCs) from September 2005 to November 2016 as the longitudinal Uniform Data Set (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">Weintraub, 2009</xref>), were assessed in this study. We restricted our analysis to 24,661 subjects whose sex, race, and <italic>APOE</italic> genotypes were available in order to assess the effects of <italic>APOE</italic> on longevity (~70% of total subjects). NACC subjects are regarded as a referral-based or volunteer series, and the majority of these subjects are Caucasians (84.2%) with variable cognitive status at final visit (36.0% normal cognition, 4.2% impaired but not MCI, 15.6% MCI, 44.3% dementia) (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="supp1">Supplementary file 1a</xref>). This cumulative database also contains neuropathological data from a subset of deceased individuals (N = 3,528, 65.2% of total deceased subjects). For comparison with the <italic>APOE</italic> ε3/ε3 genotype (i.e. <italic>APOE3</italic>) in the primary analysis, <italic>APOE</italic> ε2/ε2 and ε2/ε3 genotypes were grouped together into an <italic>APOE2</italic> group, while <italic>APOE</italic> ε3/ε4 and ε4/ε4 genotypes were grouped together into an <italic>APOE4</italic> group. Although not the primary focus of this study, comparisons between <italic>APOE</italic> ε2/ε4 and ε3/ε3 genotypes were also made, as shown in <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="supp1">Supplementary file 1</xref>.</p><p>NACC demographic variables that were utilized in our study included death, age at death, age at initial visit, age at final visit, sex, and race. Degree of cognitive impairment was assessed by cognitive status at final visit using the NACCUDSD variable (which describes cognitive status: normal cognition, impaired but not mild cognitive MCI, MCI, or dementia), and also by clinically diagnosed AD at final visit. Clinically diagnosed AD at final visit was defined as presence of both dementia on NACCUDSD, and a value of ‘yes’ on NACCALZD (which describes etiologic diagnosis of AD). Cardiovascular factors (occurrence of these at any visit was assessed) that were measured included hypertension, transient ischemic attack, pacemaker, angioplasty/endarterectomy/stent, heart attack/cardiac arrest, cardiac bypass procedure, atrial fibrillation, hypercholesterolemia, congestive heart failure, and stroke. We also utilized data from the geriatric depression scale (GDS), where answers to 15 different yes/no questions are recorded as well as a total GDS score that ranges from 0 to 15 and represents the sum of the scores for the individual GDS questions.</p><p>Neuropathological information was collected regarding Consortium to Establish a Registry for Alzheimer's Disease (CERAD) diffuse plaque score, CERAD neuritic plaque score, Braak NFT stage, and the presence of vascular pathology. It is of note that the neuropathologically-assessed cohort had a different frequency of dementia and AD, compared to the overall cohort, with much higher rates of dementia (78.3 vs. 44.3%) and AD (58.0 vs. 35.3%) at final NACC visit, likely due to higher rate of postmortem analysis of demented subjects (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="supp1">Supplementary file 1b</xref>). Minimal amyloid pathology was defined as both no neuritic plaques and no or sparse diffuse plaques (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">Shinohara et al., 2016</xref>).</p></sec><sec id="s4-2"><title>Statistical analysis of NACC human clinical data</title><p>Statistical analyses were performed using SAS (version 9.4; SAS Institute, Inc, Cary, North Carolina) and R Statistical Software (version 3.2.3; R Foundation for Statistical Computing, Vienna, Austria). The Kaplan-Meier method was used to estimate survival (i.e. after birth), where censoring occurred at the date of the last NACC visit for subjects who did not die. In the primary analysis including all subjects, Cox proportional hazards regression models were used to compare survival between <italic>APOE</italic> carriers. Models were first adjusted for sex and race, and then were subsequently adjusted for cognitive status at final NACC visit and clinically diagnosed AD at final NACC visit in order to account for these two strong confounding factors that are related to both <italic>APOE</italic> genotype and survival. We also stratified by the AD/non-AD status and compared survival using Cox regression models that were adjusted for sex and race. In a sensitivity analysis, we additionally adjusted our Cox models for the aforementioned 10 cardiovascular factors in the subset (97.7%) of subjects who had this information available.</p><p>We subsequently examined only neuropathologically assessed cases in order to evaluate the relationship between <italic>APOE</italic>-mediated longevity and AD-related neuropathology. Specifically, Cox proportional hazards regression models that were adjusted for sex, race, CERAD diffuse plaque score, CERAD neuritic plaque score, Braak NFT stage, and the presence of vascular pathology were utilized to compare survival between <italic>APOE</italic> carriers. These comparisons were also made separately in subjects with minimal amyloid pathology, where Cox proportional hazards regression models were adjusted for sex and race. Finally, additional adjustment for cardiovascular factors in Cox regression models was examined in a sensitivity analysis.</p><p>In order to adjust for the fact that two primary comparisons of survival were made (i.e. between <italic>APOE3</italic> and <italic>APOE4</italic> subjects, and also between <italic>APOE3</italic> and <italic>APOE2</italic> subjects), we applied a Bonferroni correction after multiple testing, after which p-values&lt;0.025 were considered as statistically significant. All statistical tests were two-sided.</p><p>For analysis of the GDS individual items and total score, we restricted the analysis to subjects who were cognitively normal at their last evaluation in order to exclude the possibility of obtaining false answers from cognitively impaired subjects. Comparisons between <italic>APOE3</italic> and <italic>APOE4</italic> subjects, and also between <italic>APOE3</italic> and <italic>APOE2</italic> subjects, were made using binary logistic regression models for the 15 individual yes/no items, and using proportional odds logistic regression models for the ordinal 0–15 total GDS score (where total GDS scores ≥ 10 were collapsed together into one category due to their low frequencies). Models were adjusted for sex, race, and age at the time of the GDS questionnaire. Odds ratios (ORs) and 95% CIs were estimated and are interpreted as the multiplicative increase in the odds of presence of the given characteristic for analysis of individual GDS items, and as the multiplicative increase in the odds of a higher score for analysis of the total GDS score. The primary comparison was regarding the GDS item ‘have you dropped many of your activities and interests’. In secondary analysis, comparisons of the remaining GDS items as well as the GDS score were also made to examine whether <italic>APOE</italic> genotype is systematically associated with depression rather than with the more specific ‘dropped activities and interests’ GDS question. In order to adjust for the two comparisons of each GDS item, we applied a Bonferroni correction separately for each GDS outcome measure, after which p-values&lt;0.025 were considered as statistically significant. Additionally, we evaluated the association between the GDS ‘dropped activities and interests’ item and survival using a Cox proportional hazards regression model that was adjusted for sex, race, and <italic>APOE</italic> genotype group, where the same group of subjects who were cognitively normal and older than 60 at the time of GDS evaluation were examined. Again, censoring occurred at the date of the last NACC visit for subjects who did not die. All statistical tests were two-sided.</p></sec><sec id="s4-3"><title>Animals</title><p>Human apoE-TR mice expressing human apoE2, apoE3, or apoE4, under the control of the mouse apoE promoter, known as apoE-targeted replacement (apoE-TR) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">Sullivan et al., 1997</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Sullivan et al., 1998</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Knouff et al., 1999</xref>), and <italic>Apoe</italic>-knockout (KO) mice (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Piedrahita et al., 1992</xref>) on a pure C57BL/6 background were used in this study. All cohorts examined in this study were generated from homozygous breeding pairs, group housed without enrichment structures in a specific pathogen-free environment in ventilated cages and used in experiments according to the standards established by the Mayo Clinic Institutional Animal Care and Use Committee (IACUC, Protocol# A58312). We analyzed two animal cohorts in this study (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="supp1">Supplementary file 1d</xref>).

The first cohort was employed for the survival analysis, and the second was employed for biochemical analyses. In the first cohort used for the survival analysis (n = 118), we euthanized mice when they showed severe age-related symptoms (33.9% of total animals) including severe weakness (a severely hunched posture, rapid weight loss (10% decrease in one week), and lethargy), large abdominal masses, significant skin lesions, and prolapse, according to the guidelines of the Mayo Clinic IACUC to avoid severe pain and distress before death in animals. These symptoms were diagnosed by the expert on-site veterinarian, according to the NIH Body Condition Scoring system (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Burkholder et al., 2012</xref>). Two mice (2% of the total mice) were also euthanized for reasons not related to these health issues; the animals survived until the end of our project, and thus, they were censored in the whole survival analysis. The remaining 66.1% of mice died naturally. A significant difference in the number of euthanized/naturally-dead mice was not observed among <italic>APOE</italic> genotype groups. In the second cohort employed for biochemical analyses, we analyzed the same apoE2-, apoE3- and apoE4-TR mice as we have previously reported (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">Shinohara et al., 2016</xref>), except <italic>Apoe</italic>-KO mice were also included.

Reviewer 2 asked if it is possible that the increased activity in APOE2 carriers is related to improved cerebrovascular function. For example, Conejero-Goldberg et al., 2014, showed that ECM/integrin-related upregulations, cyclophilin A (CypA) downregulation, and increases in collagen VI and laminin might help in the maintenance of the BBB integrity in APOE2 carriers. Recent studies have shown that the BBB breakdown is associated with cognitive impairment independently of AD amyloid and tau pathology (Nation et al., 2019). Moreover, the BBB breakdown is accelerated in individuals carrying the ε4 allele of the APOE compared to APOE3 homozygotes, and can predict cognitive impairment independently of amyloid and/or tau pathology (Montagne et al., 2020). Although the later study did not include APOE2 carriers gene it is still possible that stabilization of the vascular function, particularly the BBB integrity could contribute to APOE2 protective effects independently of AD pathology. This particularly as the pro-inflammatory CypA-MMP9 pathway is involved in BBB breakdown in APOE4 carriers (Montagne et al., Nature, 2020), and is downregulated in APOE2 carriers as shown by Conejero-Goldberg et al.

In the first cohort employed for the survival analysis, we did not perform any memory-based behavioral tasks, as these tasks are generally invasive, potentially affecting animal survival. In the second cohort employed for biochemical analyses, we have performed water maze test to assess effects of APOE genotype on memory. That result was already reported in Shinohara et al., Annals of Neurology 79(5):758-774, 2016. The current manuscript used only data which was not reported in the previous paper.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Reviewer 2 asked if it is possible that the increased activity in APOE2 carriers is related to improved cerebrovascular function. For example, Conejero-Goldberg et al., 2014, showed that ECM/integrin-related upregulations, cyclophilin A (CypA) downregulation, and increases in collagen VI and laminin might help in the maintenance of the blood-brain barrier (BBB) integrity in APOE2 carriers.

We have now included these three important papers and added discussion of necessity to study potential protective effects of APOE2 on vascular function and integrity (Discussion, sixth paragraph).</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Reviewer 3 points out that certain associations with plasma lipids and other factors (e.g. Triglycerides and rearing behavior and triglycerides and plasma apoE) may be driven by the fact that ApoE2 KI have very high plasma cholesterol and triglycerides in the plasma and not necessarily by the differences in the lipid profiles. Is there any evidence that correlations like this can be seen only within one apoE genotype or when one controls for apoE genotype?</p></disp-quote><p>We appreciate the reviewer 3’s critical and important comments on the necessity to check correlation within each APOE genotype. Indeed, several positive correlations between activity levels and apoE or lipid levels disappeared after stratifying APOE genotype, while correlations between apoE and lipid levels mostly survive even after stratifying APOE genotype. One possibility is that animal behavior scores easily affected by individual variations, or the time lag (~one month) between behavior test and tissue harvesting could contribute additional variability to observe clear correlation within each genotype with limited number of mice. Another possibility is that factors other than apoE and associated lipids might be involved in APOE2-mediated longevity, while the beneficial effects of these apoE-associated lipids (i.e., HDL-cholesterol or triglyceride) on longevity were previously reported as discussed. We have described these points in the Discussion (fifth paragraph).</p></body></sub-article></article>
