risk. Validating causative genes and understanding their mechanisms remain challenging. We assessed a semi-high throughput zebrafish screening platform for rapid in vivo functional testing of candidate FBD genes. Six genes linked to severe recessive osteogenesis imperfecta (OI) and four associated with bone mineral density (BMD) from genome-wide association studies were analyzed. Using CRISPR/Cas9-based crispant screening in F0 mosaic founder zebrafish, Next-generation sequencing confirmed high indel efficiency (mean 88%), mimicking stable knock-out models. Skeletal phenotyping at 7, 14, and 90 days post-fertilization (dpf) using microscopy, Alizarin Red S staining, and microCT was performed. Larval crispants showed variable osteoblast and mineralization phenotypes, while adult crispants displayed consistent skeletal defects, including malformed neural and haemal arches, vertebral fractures and fusions, and altered bone volume and density. In addition, aldh7a1 and mbtps2 crispants experienced increased mortality due to severe skeletal deformities. RT-qPCR revealed differential expression of osteogenic markers bglap and col1a1a, highlighting their biomarker potential. Our results establish zebrafish crispant screening as a robust tool for FBD gene validation, combining skeletal and molecular analyses across developmental stages to uncover novel insights into gene functions in bone biology.</p></abstract><kwd-group kwd-group-type="author-keywords"><kwd>genetics</kwd><kwd>Crispants</kwd><kwd><italic>Danio rerio</italic></kwd></kwd-group><kwd-group kwd-group-type="research-organism"><title>Research organism</title><kwd>Zebrafish</kwd></kwd-group><funding-group><award-group id="fund1"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/501100003130</institution-id><institution>Fonds Wetenschappelijk Onderzoek</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>FWO.OPR.2020.0023.01</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Debaenst</surname><given-names>Sophie</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><funding-statement>The funders had no role in study design, data collection and interpretation, or the decision to submit the work for publication.</funding-statement></funding-group><custom-meta-group><custom-meta specific-use="meta-only"><meta-name>Author impact statement</meta-name><meta-value>Crispant analysis in zebrafish serves as a powerful tool for the rapid functional screening of genes implicated in bone fragility disorders, like osteogenesis imperfecta and osteoporosis.</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta specific-use="meta-only"><meta-name>publishing-route</meta-name><meta-value>prc</meta-value></custom-meta></custom-meta-group></article-meta></front><body><sec id="s1" sec-type="intro"><title>Introduction</title><p>Heritable fragile bone disorders (FBD), which are generally associated with increased fracture risk, range from common multifactorial conditions to rare monogenic diseases (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Charoenngam et al., 2023</xref>). They present within a wide phenotypic spectrum where monogenic disorders are generally more severe and often include skeletal deformities and extra-skeletal abnormalities. Multifactorial FBD, on the other hand, usually present with milder symptoms that are often restricted to bone fragility. Osteoporosis is a common skeletal disease characterized by low bone mass, low bone mineral density (BMD) and increased fracture risk (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Kanis et al., 1994</xref>). It affects about 200 million people around the world (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Pouresmaeili et al., 2018</xref>). In Europe, 5.6% of the population aged over 50 is diagnosed with osteoporosis, making it a highly prevalent disease, especially in the elderly. The risk of osteoporosis is influenced by both environmental factors, such as physical activity, diet preferences, medication use, coexisting diseases, and genetic factors (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">Ralston and Uitterlinden, 2010</xref>). Low BMD and fractures are highly heritable risk factors, with heritability values ranging from 50% to 80% (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">Richards et al., 2012</xref>). Genome-wide association studies (GWAS) in humans have unraveled hundreds of susceptible loci associated with BMD and other bone traits related to risk of osteoporotic fracture (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib53">Zhu et al., 2021</xref>). GWAS results have great potential for the development of drug targets, the identification of risk factors, and risk prediction for osteoporosis. However, the identification of causal genes at these loci or the mechanisms by which GWAS loci alter bone physiology has faced challenges due to the scarcity of <italic>in vivo</italic> validation tools with sufficient throughput (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib38">Sabik and Farber, 2017</xref>).</p><p>In monogenic FBD, on the other hand, gene identification is generally more straightforward. One example of such a disease is osteogenesis imperfecta (OI), a genetically heterogeneous connective tissue disorder that is mainly characterized by bone fragility, skeletal deformities, and other extra skeletal manifestations (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Forlino and Marini, 2016</xref>). Although in the majority of cases, it is caused by autosomal dominant mutations in the collagen type 1 genes, mutations in an increasing number of non-collagen genes causing severe recessive forms of OI, are being identified. These genes encode proteins that are involved in different aspects of bone formation, such as osteoblast differentiation (OSTERIX, WNT1, OASIS, S2P, and SPARC), bone mineralization (PEDF and BRIL) and collagen processing (HSP47, FKBP65, LH2, KDELR2, CRTAP, P3H1, CyPB, and TRIC-B) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Forlino and Marini, 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Jovanovic et al., 2022</xref>). Recent sequencing technologies have improved genetic diagnosis, but the investigation of the pathogenesis of the different forms of OI is still a laborious, costly, and time-consuming task. Hence, it is essential to develop efficient and cost-effective methods for <italic>in vivo</italic> functional testing to validate the involvement and mechanistic role of candidate and newly identified causal genes in the pathogenesis of FBD.</p><p>Zebrafish are a valuable model organism for studying human diseases, as they share a high degree of genetic similarity with humans. More than 70% of human protein-coding genes and 82% of human disease-related genes have zebrafish orthologs, including most of the genes involved in skeletogenesis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Howe et al., 2013</xref>). Additionally, zebrafish share many of their skeletal features and ossification mechanisms with mammals (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Dietrich et al., 2021</xref>) and numerous zebrafish models for skeletal diseases have been established and investigated (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Gistelinck et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Daponte et al., 2023</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Kague and Karasik, 2022</xref>). These models have some advantages over rodent models, such as longer survival, likely due to the reduced impact of gravity on their fragile skeletons in the aquatic environment, and the availability of transgenic lines marking specific bone cell types combined with the transparency of early life stages allowing for <italic>in vivo</italic> observation of the dynamics of skeletal development (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Dietrich et al., 2021</xref>).</p><p>Genome-editing with CRISPR/Cas9 is a fast and easy method to create knockout alleles and stable zebrafish mutant lines (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib46">Uribe-Salazar et al., 2022</xref>). However, obtaining zebrafish lines that are homozygous for the mutant alleles requires two generations of adult animals (&gt;6 months), which limits the efficiency and affordability of genetic screens (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Kroll et al., 2021</xref>). To overcome these drawbacks, phenotyping the first-generation (F0) mosaic founder zebrafish, also known as crispants, is an emerging approach. Adult crispants have a shorter generation time (~3 months) than stable lines (6–9 months), which allows screening more genes in less time and at lower costs and resources. We previously demonstrated the feasibility of this approach by comparing the phenotypes and molecular profiles of a stable knockout line and a crispant for the osteoporosis gene <italic>lrp5</italic>, and found them to be highly similar (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Bek et al., 2020</xref>). In a study by <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib49">Watson et al., 2020</xref>, comparison of crispants to homozygous germline mutants for <italic>bmp1a</italic> and <italic>plod2</italic>, two causal OI genes, revealed phenotypic convergence, suggesting that crispants faithfully recapitulate the biology of germline skeletal disease models. Therefore, while zebrafish crispant screens are promising as an economic, fast, and biologically relevant genetic screening approach in vertebrate model systems, a rigorous evaluation of their potential to screen for FBD-associated genes is needed.</p><p>In this study, we aimed to conduct a pilot-study to evaluate the feasibility of zebrafish crispant screening as a gene-based approach for rapid <italic>in vivo</italic> functional screening and validation of a set of causal genes for a broad range of FBD. The selected set includes on one hand genes associated with traits related to osteoporosis which is a relatively mild late-onset FBD and on the other hand genes causing recessive forms of OI associated with more severe skeletal phenotypes. An overview of the selected genes with observed mutant phenotypes in human, mice and zebrafish is provided in <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="supp1">Supplementary file 1a</xref>. With this study, we want to provide an experimental platform for medium-sized zebrafish crispant screening of FBD genes.</p></sec><sec id="s2" sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><sec id="s2-1"><title>Generation of zebrafish crispants for osteoporosis and OI genes</title><p>To identify and prioritize potential causal genes for osteoporosis, we used the GWAS catalog (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib45">Sollis et al., 2023</xref>). We selected the variants associated with bone density and ranked them by their GWAS evidence, i.e., the number of independent publications that reported significant associations. We then identified the genes that harbored these variants and chose the top four candidates with single zebrafish orthologs: <italic>ALDH7A1</italic>, <italic>ESR1</italic>, <italic>DAAM2,</italic> and <italic>SOST</italic>. Furthermore, we selected six genes associated with recessive forms of OI associated with severe skeletal phenotypes, and involved in different aspects of bone formation, including osteoblast differentiation (<italic>CREB3L1, MBTPS2, and SPARC),</italic> bone mineralization (<italic>SERPINF1</italic> and <italic>IFITM5</italic>) and collagen transport (<italic>SEC24D</italic>).</p><p>For each of the 10 selected genes and ‘scrambled’ sequence, Alt-R gRNAs (IDT) were designed through a thorough procedure, via the Benchling platform.

Based on previous studies, we assumed that high indel (insertion/deletion) and OOF efficiencies result in a sufficient reduction or inactivation of the corresponding protein in crispants to induce a skeletal phenotype (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib33">Naert et al., 2020</xref>). DNA from a pool of 1 dpf larvae (n=10) for the different crispants and corresponding sibling controls, was extracted, and subjected to NGS analysis. Sequencing data was analyzed using the Crispresso2 tool (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib5">Clement et al., 2019</xref>) to determine the fraction of reads containing indels, the OOF rate and the number of in-frame deletions consisting of more than 6 base pairs in these pools (<xref ref-type="table" rid="table1">Table 1</xref>).</p><table-wrap id="table1" position="float"><label>Table 1.</label><caption><title>InDelphi-mESC prediction, indel, out-of-frame indel and in-frame rates for the different crispants, determined by NGS from pools of 1dpf embryos.</title><p>The first four genes are associated with the pathogenesis of osteoporosis, while the last six are linked to osteogenesis imperfecta.

We subsequently determined the proportion of reads containing in-frame deletions of at least six base pairs, resulting in the removal of two or more amino acids (<xref ref-type="table" rid="table1">Table 1</xref>; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1</xref>). Such deletions have a relatively high chance of impairing protein function (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Emond et al., 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib41">Savino et al., 2022</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Miton and Tokuriki, 2023</xref>). The accumulated percentage of reads with indels that likely cause loss-of-function of the respective protein (OOF % + % in-frame indel ≥6 bp), fall within the range of 60% to 92%, although also reads with short in-frame indels (&lt;6 bp) can affect protein function. Finally, we investigated the occurrence of off-target effects in these samples by analyzing NGS data from the three most probable off-target sites per crispant, as determined by the CFD score provided by the CRISPOR tool (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib6">Concordet and Haeussler, 2018</xref>). In 20 out of the 30 examined off-target sites, no off-target mutations were identified (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="supp1">Supplementary file 1b</xref>). For the remaining off-target sites, the off-target rate ranged from 0,11% to 2,82%. This included basepair substitutions which are most likely sequencing errors, or true off-target indel variants, present in such low number of genomes that it is negligible in terms of biological impact in the crispants.</p></sec><sec id="s2-2"><title>Assessment of the early skeleton in crispants reveals differences in osteoblast-positive and mineralized surface areas</title><p>Crispants and sibling controls were raised until 7 or 14 dpf.

In this study, we tested the efficacy of a semi-high throughput zebrafish crispant analysis for rapid validation of candidate disease causing genes for skeletal disorders across a broad phenotypic spectrum. On one hand, we included genes for non-classical recessive OI, which is an early-onset monogenic skeletal syndrome with severe skeletal deformities. On the other hand, we screened a set of top candidate genes for osteoporosis, which is a rather late-onset multifactorial disease with little to no deformities. All selected genes show skeletal expression in both human and zebrafish. An overview of the selected genes with observed mutant phenotypes in human, mice and zebrafish is provided in <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="supp1">Supplementary file 1a</xref>. It is important to note that this study focused on candidate genes for osteoporosis, not on the role of specific variants identified in GWAS studies. Non-coding variants for instance, which are often identified in GWAS studies, present significant challenges in terms of functional validation and interpretation.

distinct larval stages, 7 dpf and 14 dpf, diverse measurements of the early skeleton were conducted, including an assessment of both the osteoblast-positive and the mineralized surface areas located in the head region. The osteoblast-positive area represents the quantity of osteoblasts within a given structure and is a measure of the formation of bone matrix. Although a general tendency towards increased areas could be noted across different crispants at 14 dpf, only crispants for <italic>esr1</italic> showed a consistent increase at both 7 and 14 dpf. Interestingly, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Brett et al., 2021</xref> extensively investigated <italic>esr1</italic> mutations in the context of hormone receptor-positive breast cancer but did not evaluate the presence of osteoblasts. However, the depletion of estrogen in an osteoblastic cell line <italic>in vitro</italic> results in the stimulation of osteoblast differentiation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib42">Schiavi et al., 2021</xref>).</p><p>The extent of mineralization of the head skeletal elements was found to be mostly not different compared to controls, although in the crispants where significant differences were detected at one of the studied time points, the mineralization of the head skeleton elements was mostly lower and of the notochord tip higher. Only crispants for <italic>sec24d</italic>, a gene critical for transporting extracellular matrix (ECM) proteins, exhibited reduced mineralization in different head structures both at 7 dpf and 14 dpf. These findings aligned with the observed malformations in <italic>bulldog</italic> zebrafish, where disrupted <italic>sec24d</italic> function leads to head abnormalities and growth delays in early larval stages (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib40">Sarmah et al., 2010</xref>). Although the measurements of osteoblast-positive and mineralized surface areas may be influenced by size differences among some of the crispants, normalization to size parameters was not conducted, as variations in growth were considered integral to the phenotypic outcome.</p><p>Despite considerable variability in the measurements we conducted, a subtle trend emerged in the expression data for osteogenic markers during early stages. Specifically, the expression of <italic>bglap</italic>, a late osteoblast differentiation marker appeared to be consistently downregulated in near all crispants, except for crispants for <italic>sost</italic>, <italic>mbtps2,</italic> and <italic>sparc</italic> at 7 dpf. However, this downregulation became less pronounced at 14 dpf, affecting only crispants for <italic>aldh7a1, daam2, esr1,</italic> and <italic>creb3l1</italic>. Interestingly, most crispants for genes involved in the pathogenesis of osteoporosis exhibited this downregulation, except for <italic>sost</italic>, where the expression of <italic>bglap</italic> remained unaffected. In contrast, the expression of <italic>col1a1a</italic> showed an opposing trend. Initially, a modest upregulation of this marker was observed at 7 dpf, limited to just four crispants. However, this effect intensified over time, with nearly all crispants displaying upregulation at 14 dpf, except for <italic>aldh7a1</italic>, <italic>esr1</italic>, and <italic>sparc</italic>. The remarkable upregulation of <italic>col1a1</italic> expression could potentially arise from an abundance of immature osteoblasts within the cranial skeleton, a phenomenon we frequently observed across the set of crispants (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Amarasekara et al., 2021</xref>). These osteoblasts play an active role in the synthesis of the organic bone matrix, including the production of collagen type I fibers. Interestingly, the generally diminished expression of the late osteoblastic marker <italic>bglap</italic> corroborates the presence of less mature osteoblasts (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Gavaia et al., 2006</xref>). As mainly mature osteoblasts engage in the deposition of calcium and phosphate ions, essential for the formation of hydroxyapatite crystals, bone mineralization can be expected to be reduced in the crispants, which results in increased formation of non-mineralized osteoid deposits. Indeed, we observed that despite often increased bone osteoblast-positive surfaces, mineralization-positive areas in the head skeleton were frequently found to be reduced (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">Salhotra et al., 2020</xref>). The differential expression profiles of the osteogenic markers <italic>bglap</italic> and <italic>col1a1a</italic> highlight their potential as biomarkers for osteoblast differentiation and bone formation in FBD crispant screens. However, it is important to note that the genes evaluated by RT-PCR are not exclusively expressed in bone tissue. Since whole-body samples were used for expression analysis, there is a possibility that the observed changes in gene expression may be influenced by other non-skeletal cell types.</p><p>In early stages of development, we observed that crispants, although presenting with a high indel frequency, showed a relatively high variability for the phenotypic parameters we tested (mineralization and osteoblast surface areas), which often prevented reaching statistical significance. Phenotypic variability in these zebrafish larvae can be attributed to several factors, including crispant mosaicism, allele heterogeneity, environmental factors, differences in genomic background and development, maternally-deposited RNAs, and slightly variable imaging positioning. In our study, for each crispant and corresponding controls, all experiments at different ages were conducted on zebrafish from the same clutch, allowing analysis of a developmental time series in animals with a relative genetically homogeneous background. Although increasing the number of biological replicates could potentially enhance statistical power, previous studies have not confirmed this (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib51">Winter et al., 2022</xref>). Enhancing out-of frame (OOF) rates by simultaneously targeting a single gene with multiple crRNAs could potentially increase the penetrance of phenotypic abnormalities observed in early crispants. By directing crRNAs to multiple loci within one gene, the likelihood of introducing frameshift mutations increases significantly. This is suggested to lead to a higher rate of biallelic knockout and reduce the chances of retaining the functional protein (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Kroll et al., 2021</xref>). However, this also elevates the likelihood of off-target effects, increases double-strand breaks and toxicity, while simultaneously increasing costs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib52">Wu et al., 2018</xref>). Furthermore, also in-frame indels affecting two or more amino acids, detected in a substantial proportion of NGS reads in our study, are likely to have a detrimental effect on protein function (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Emond et al., 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib41">Savino et al., 2022</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib31">Miton and Tokuriki, 2023</xref>). Therefore, and because we used highly efficient two-part guide RNAs Alt-R CRISPR-Cas9 system, we opted for single crRNA injections. While there remains a possibility of false negatives, the overall indel efficiency, as indicated by our NGS analysis, is high (&gt;90%), thereby reducing the likelihood of having crispants with very low indel efficiency.</p><p>In adult crispants, the skeletal phenotype was generally more penetrant. All crispants showed malformed arches, a majority displayed vertebral fractures and fusions and some crispants exhibited distinct quantitative variations in vertebral body measurements. Additionally, these skeletal malformations were consistently observed in a second clutch of crispants (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig4s3">Figure 4—figure supplement 3</xref>), underscoring the reproducibility of these phenotypic features across independent clutches. This confirmed the role of the selected genes in skeletal development and homeostasis and their involvement in skeletal disease and established the crispant approach as a valid approach for rapidly providing <italic>in vivo</italic> gene function data to support candidate gene identification.</p><p>Osteoporosis is typically linked with symptoms that appear late in life. However, our results challenged this notion, by showing that in crispants for osteoporosis genes, skeletal abnormalities can manifest earlier and are not solely reflected in changes to bone mineral density (BMD). For instance, we found that <italic>aldh7a1</italic> and <italic>esr1</italic> crispants displayed significant skeletal anomalies already at larval stages, with <italic>aldh7a1</italic> crispants showing early lethality. At adult stages, <italic>esr1</italic> and <italic>sost</italic> crispants demonstrated various morphological abnormalities of the vertebral column such as fusions, compressions, and arch malformations. The more pronounced and earlier phenotypes in these zebrafish crispants are most likely attributed to the quasi knock-out state of the studied genes, while more common less impactful variants in the same genes result in typical late-onset osteoporosis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Laine et al., 2013</xref>). This phenomenon is also observed in knock-out mouse models for these genes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Melville et al., 2014</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Coughlin et al., 2019</xref>).</p><p>Interestingly, all adult crispants for osteoporosis genes demonstrated a substantial increase in centrum Tissue Mineral Density (TMD). TMD is quantitative measure of the actual mineral volume within bone tissue, computed as bone mineral content over the bone volume (mgHA/cm3) and obtained through mCT or pQCT. In human patients, reduced bone mineral density (aBMD), a measure for the bone mineral content in a projected bone area and assessed using dual energy X-ray absorptiometry (DXA), is frequently linked to osteoporosis. However, also TMD, or vBMD, can be evaluated in the trabecular and cortical bone. Knock-out mice lacking Sost showed an increase in TMD within the cortical bone, which is comparable to the bone present in the zebrafish vertebral column (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib27">Li et al., 2008</xref>). As for the other genes, for <italic>daam2</italic>, mutant mice with a hypomorphic <italic>Daam2</italic> allele presented with reduced bone strength and increased cortical bone porosity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">Morris et al., 2019</xref>). <italic>ERα</italic> knockout mice presented with a decrease in cortical bone mineral density and increase in trabecular bone mineral density (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Melville et al., 2014</xref>). Further studies are needed to better understand how high TMD values observed in these crispants relate to phenotypic changes observed in these mouse models. Finally, it is worthwhile to note that, osteoporosis typically correlates with low vBMD values. While neither the causal variant nor the biological direction of its effects on the target gene are known for BMD-associated loci harboring these genes, the increased TMD following gene knockdown in our models may help to assign the directionality of their effects, and puts forth the possibility that variants at these loci alter the expression of genes that converge on a common biological process in zebrafish, when disrupted results in the high TMD.</p><p>Conversely, crispants for genes involved in recessive forms of OI, an early-onset severe skeletal disorder, can intuitively be expected to exhibit pronounced skeletal abnormalities already in larval stages. Interestingly, during these early stages, the majority of the crispants do not exhibit consistent skeletal abnormalities. Although this could be partially explained by the above-discussed variability of the phenotypic outcomes we measured, also human OI subjects with these severe conditions, often experience disease onset during infancy only, with progressive worsening of the skeletal phenotype (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib44">Selina et al., 2023</xref>).</p><p>The phenomenon of genetic compensation could play a role in explaining why early phenotypes manifest differently in human patients compared to zebrafish. Genetic compensation ensures an organism to maintain its genetic robustness, even when genetic variation, possibly induced by mutations, occurs. This compensation mechanism can be triggered by the upregulation of compensating genes, often mediated through the regulation of nonsense-mediated decay (NMD) in combination with the epigenetic machinery in zebrafish (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">El-Brolosy and Stainier, 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib20">Jakutis and Stainier, 2021</xref>). Crispants, in contrast to morphants, also undergo NMD although in a mosaic manner. In larval crispants, compensatory mechanisms may effectively mask the impact of gene loss. However, in adult crispants, the cumulative effect of this loss becomes more pronounced, leading to a later onset phenotype. Furthermore, specific tissues or cell types within the organism may activate compensatory pathways more efficiently, thereby influencing the overall manifestation of the phenotype. When a gene is disrupted in humans, the consequences can be more severe due to the complexity of human development and biology. Such disruptions may result in developmental abnormalities, leading to an early onset of phenotypic traits (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">Rouf et al., 2023</xref>).</p><p>To conclude, our study proposes a multifaceted gene-based approach to investigate zebrafish crispants associated with heritable FBDs, employing various techniques, and assessing different skeletal phenotypes and molecular profiles at distinct developmental stages. While this work represents a pioneering effort in establishing a screening platform for skeletal diseases, it offers opportunities for future improvement and refinement. For instance, analyzing different skeletal structures and cell types within various transgenic lines, increasing sample size, and incorporating a broader range of techniques, such as phenotypic scoring based on the type of malformations seen in the vertebral column or alcian blue staining for cartilage tissue evaluation, could enhance the comprehensiveness of the screening process and the skeletal phenotype. Moreover, to explore the underlying mechanisms contributing to disease phenotypes, it is essential to establish stable knockout mutants derived from the crispants. Nonetheless, our initial set-up demonstrates the feasibility of this approach to identify genes potentially implicated in the pathogenesis of skeletal disorders, as all studied crispants exhibit skeletal abnormalities in adult stages. These findings support the prospect of crispant screening as a promising tool for rapid functional assessment of candidate genes for skeletal disorders, providing valuable insights into the roles of these genes in skeletal biology.</p></sec><sec id="s4" sec-type="materials|methods"><title>Materials and methods</title><table-wrap id="keyresource" position="anchor"><label>Key resources table</label><table frame="hsides" rules="groups"><thead><tr><th align="left" valign="top">Reagent type (species) or resource</th><th align="left" valign="top">Designation</th><th align="left" valign="top">Source or reference</th><th align="left" valign="top">Identifiers</th><th align="left" valign="top">Additional information</th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td align="left" valign="top">Genetic reagent (<italic>Danio rerio</italic>)</td><td align="left" valign="top">osx:Kaede transgenic line</td><td align="left" valign="top">Zebrafish Facility Ghent (ZFG) Core Facility</td><td align="left" valign="top">NA</td><td align="left" valign="top">NA</td></tr><tr><td align="left" valign="top">Commercial assay or kit</td><td align="left" valign="top">RNeasy Mini Kit 250 reagentia</td><td align="left" valign="top">Qiagen</td><td align="char" char="." valign="top">74106</td><td align="left" valign="top">NA</td></tr><tr><td align="left" valign="top">Commercial assay or kit</td><td align="left" valign="top">iScript cDNA Synthesis Kit</td><td align="left" valign="top">Bio-rad</td><td align="char" char="." valign="top">1708891</td><td align="left" valign="top">NA</td></tr><tr><td align="left" valign="top">Commercial assay or kit</td><td align="left" valign="top">SsoAdvanced Universal SYBR Green Supermix</td><td align="left" valign="top">Bio-rad</td><td align="char" char="ndash" valign="top">172–5274</td><td align="left" valign="top">NA</td></tr><tr><td align="left" valign="top">Other</td><td align="left" valign="top">Alizarin red S staining</td><td align="left" valign="top">Merck life sience bv</td><td align="left" valign="top">A5533-25G</td><td align="left" valign="top">NA</td></tr></tbody></table></table-wrap><sec id="s4-1"><title>Zebrafish maintenance and breeding</title><p>The zebrafish were incubated at 28 °C until 5 days post-fertilization (dpf).

In this study, the authors seek to develop a pipeline for validating these new candidate genes using crispant screening in zebrafish. Candidates were selected based on GWAS bone density evidence (4 genes) or linkage to OI cases plus some aspect of bone biology (6 genes). NGS was performed on embryos injected with different gRNAs/Cas9 to confirm high mutagenic efficacy, and off-target cutting was verified to be low. Bone growth, mineralization, density, and gene expression levels were carefully measured and compared across crispants using a battery of assays at three different stages.</p><p>Strengths:</p><p>(1) The pipeline would be straightforward to replicate in other labs, and the study could thus make a real contribution towards resolving the major bottleneck of candidate gene validation.</p><p>(2) The study is clearly written and extensively quantified.</p><p>(3) The discussion attempts to place the phenotypes of different crispant lines into the context of what is already known about each gene's function.</p><p>(4) There is added value in seeing the results for the different crispant lines side by side for each assay.</p><p>(5) Caveats to the interpretability of crispant data and limitations of their gene-focused analyses and RT-PCR assays are discussed.</p><p>Weaknesses:</p><p>(1) The study uses only well-established methods and is strategy-driven rather question/hypothesis-driven. This is in line with the researchers' primary goal of developing a workflow for rapid in vivo functional screening of candidate genes. However, this means that less attention is paid to what the results obtained for a given gene may mean regarding potential disease mechanisms, and how contradictions with prior reports of mouse or fish null mutant phenotypes might be explained.</p><p>(2) Normalization to body size was not performed. Measurements of surface area covered by osteoblasts or mineralized bone (Fig. 1) are typically normalized to body size - especially in larvae and juvenile fish - to rule out secondary changes due to delayed or accelerated overall growth. This was not done here; the authors argue that &quot;variations in growth were considered as part of the phenotypic outcome.&quot; This is reasonable, but because standard length was reported only for fish at 90 dpf (not significantly different in any line), the reader is not given the opportunity to consider whether earlier differences in, e.g. surface area covered by osteoblasts at 14 dpf, could be accounted for by delayed or accelerated overall growth. Images in Figure S5 were not taken at the same magnification, further confounding this effort.</p><p>Comments on latest version:</p><p>The authors have largely addressed my comments by making changes to the text.</p><p>However, in response to one of my original comments (&quot;It would be helpful to note the grouping of candidates into OI vs. BMD GWAS throughout the figures&quot;), they added a sentence to this effect to the legends. However, because two of the lines were larval-lethal, the legends to Figs. S6-8 are now incorrect in referring to ten genes when only eight mutants are shown.</p></body></sub-article><sub-article article-type="referee-report" id="sa3"><front-stub><article-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.100060.3.sa3</article-id><title-group><article-title>Reviewer #3 (Public review):</article-title></title-group><contrib-group><contrib contrib-type="author"><anonymous/><role specific-use="referee">Reviewer</role></contrib></contrib-group></front-stub><body><p>The manuscript describes the use of CRISPR gene editing coupled with phenotyping mosaic zebrafish larvae to characterize functions of genes implicated in heritable fragile bone disorders (FBDs). Authors targeted six high-confident candidate genes implicated in severe recessive forms of FBDs and four Osteoporosis GWAS-implicated genes and observe varied developmental phenotypes across all crispants, in addition to adult skeletal phenotypes. While the study lacks insight on underlying mechanisms that contribute to disease phenotypes, a major strength of the paper is the streamlined method that produced significant phenotypes for all candidate genes tested. It also represents a significant increase in number of candidate genes tested using their crispant approach beyond the single mutant that was previously published.</p><p>One weakness was the variability of developmental phenotypes, addressed by authors in the Discussion. This might be a product of maternal transcripts not targeted by CRISPR or genetic compensation, which authors have not fully explored. Overall, the paper was well-written and easy to read.</p><p>Comments on latest version:</p><p>The authors have addressed many concerns in this revision. Figure 1 and Table 2 are much improved.</p><p>While details of orthologous gene expression profiles of target genes is a welcome addition, other features of target genes remain unaddressed. For example, do genes with maternally deposited transcript exhibit dampened phenotypes? Or does genetic compensation impact certain genes more than others? Since authors state that the study represents a methods paper, it will be important for users to understand the caveats of gene selection to effectively implement and interpret results of the approach.</p></body></sub-article><sub-article article-type="author-comment" id="sa4"><front-stub><article-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.100060.3.sa4</article-id><title-group><article-title>Author response</article-title></title-group><contrib-group><contrib contrib-type="author"><name><surname>Debaenst</surname><given-names>Sophie</given-names></name><role specific-use="author">Author</role><aff><institution>Ghent University</institution><addr-line><named-content content-type="city">Ghent</named-content></addr-line><country>Belgium</country></aff></contrib><contrib contrib-type="author"><name><surname>Jarayseh</surname><given-names>Tamara</given-names></name><role specific-use="author">Author</role><aff><institution>Ghent University</institution><addr-line><named-content content-type="city">Ghent</named-content></addr-line><country>Belgium</country></aff></contrib><contrib contrib-type="author"><name><surname>De Saffel</surname><given-names>Hanna</given-names></name><role specific-use="author">Author</role><aff><institution>Ghent University</institution><addr-line><named-content content-type="city">Ghent</named-content></addr-line><country>Belgium</country></aff></contrib><contrib contrib-type="author"><name><surname>Bek</surname><given-names>Jan Willem</given-names></name><role specific-use="author">Author</role><aff><institution>Ghent University</institution><addr-line><named-content content-type="city">Ghent</named-content></addr-line><country>Belgium</country></aff></contrib><contrib contrib-type="author"><name><surname>Boone</surname><given-names>Matthieu</given-names></name><role specific-use="author">Author</role><aff><institution>Ghent University</institution><addr-line><named-content content-type="city">Ghent</named-content></addr-line><country>Belgium</country></aff></contrib><contrib contrib-type="author"><name><surname>Josipovic</surname><given-names>Ivan</given-names></name><role specific-use="author">Author</role><aff><institution>Ghent University</institution><addr-line><named-content content-type="city">Ghent</named-content></addr-line><country>Belgium</country></aff></contrib><contrib contrib-type="author"><name><surname>Kibleur</surname><given-names>Pierre</given-names></name><role specific-use="author">Author</role><aff><institution>Ghent University</institution><addr-line><named-content content-type="city">Ghent</named-content></addr-line><country>Belgium</country></aff></contrib><contrib contrib-type="author"><name><surname>Kwon</surname><given-names>Ronald Y</given-names></name><role specific-use="author">Author</role><aff><institution>University of Washington</institution><addr-line><named-content content-type="city">Seattle</named-content></addr-line><country>United States</country></aff></contrib><contrib contrib-type="author"><name><surname>Coucke</surname><given-names>Paul</given-names></name><role specific-use="author">Author</role><aff><institution>Ghent University</institution><addr-line><named-content content-type="city">Ghent</named-content></addr-line><country>Belgium</country></aff></contrib><contrib contrib-type="author"><name><surname>Willaert</surname><given-names>Andy</given-names></name><role specific-use="author">Author</role><aff><institution>Ghent University</institution><addr-line><named-content content-type="city">Ghent</named-content></addr-line><country>Belgium</country></aff></contrib></contrib-group></front-stub><body><p>The following is the authors’ response to the original reviews.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p><bold>Public Reviews:</bold></p><p><bold>Reviewer #1 (Public review):</bold></p><p>Summary:</p><p>In this work, a screening platform is presented for rapid and cost-effective screening of candidate genes involved in Fragile Bone Disorders.

In this study, the authors seek to develop a pipeline for validating these new candidate genes using crispant screening in zebrafish. Candidates were selected based on GWAS bone density evidence (4 genes) or linkage to OI cases plus some aspect of bone biology (6 genes). NGS was performed on embryos injected with different gRNAs/Cas9 to confirm high mutagenic efficacy and off-target cutting was verified to be low. Bone growth, mineralization, density, and gene expression levels were carefully measured and compared across crispants using a battery of assays at three different stages.</p><p>Strengths:</p><p>(1) The pipeline would be straightforward to replicate in other labs, and the study could thus make a real contribution towards resolving the major bottleneck of candidate gene validation.</p><p>(2) The study is clearly written and extensively quantified.</p><p>(3) The discussion attempts to place the phenotypes of different crispant lines into the context of what is already known about each gene's function.</p><p>(4) There is added value in seeing the results for the different crispant lines side by side for each assay.</p></disp-quote><p>We would like to thank the reviewer for highlighting the strengths of our paper.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Weaknesses:</p><p>(1) The study uses only well-established methods and is strategy-driven rather than question/hypothesis-driven.</p></disp-quote><p>We thank the reviewer for this correct remark. The mayor aim of this study was to establish a workflow for rapid <italic>in vivo</italic> functional screening of candidate genes across a broad range of FBDs.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>(2) Some of the measurements are inadequately normalized and not as specific to bone as suggested:</p><p>(a) The measurements of surface area covered by osteoblasts or mineralized bone (Figure 1) should be normalized to body size. The authors note that such measures provide &quot;insight into the formation of new skeletal tissue during early development&quot; and reflect &quot;the quantity of osteoblasts within a given structure and [is] a measure of the formation of bone matrix.&quot; I agree in principle, but these measures are also secondarily impacted by the overall growth and health of the larva. The surface area data are normalized to the control but not to the size/length of each fish - the esr1 line in particular appears quite developmentally advanced in some of the images shown, which could easily explain the larger bone areas. The fact that the images in Figure S5 were not all taken at the same magnification further complicates this interpretation.</p></disp-quote><p>We thank the reviewer for this detailed and insightful remark. We agree with the reviewer and recognize that the results may be influenced by size differences. However, we do not normalize for size, as variations in growth were considered as part of the phenotypic outcome. This consideration has been addressed in the discussion section.</p><p>Line 335-338: ‘Although the measurements of osteoblast-positive and mineralized surface areas may be influenced by size differences among some of the crispants, normalization to size parameters was not conducted, as variations in growth were considered integral to the phenotypic outcome.’</p><p>Line 369: ‘Phenotypic variability in these zebrafish larvae can be attributed to several factors, including crispant mosaicism, allele heterogeneity, environmental factors, differences in genomic background <bold>and development</bold>, and slightly variable imaging positioning.’</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>(b) Some of the genes evaluated by RT-PCR in Figure 2 are expressed in other tissues in addition to bone (as are the candidate genes themselves); because whole-body samples were used for these assays, there is a nonzero possibility that observed changes may be rooted in other, non-skeletal cell types.</p></disp-quote><p>We thank the reviewer for this valuable comment. We acknowledge that the genes assessed by RT-PCR are expressed in other tissues beyond bone. This consideration has been addressed in the discussion section.</p><p>Line 362-365: “However, it is important to note that the genes evaluated by RT-PCR are not exclusively expressed in bone tissue.

We acknowledge that the results for the larval stages exhibit variability, making it challenging to synthesize them into a coherent model. However, it is important to emphasize that all adult crispant consistently display a skeletal phenotype. Consequently, the feasibility and reproducibility of this screening method are primarily focusing on the adult stages. This consideration has been addressed in the discussion section of the manuscript.</p><p>Line 391-399: ‘In adult crispants, the skeletal phenotype was generally more penetrant. All crispants showed malformed arches, a majority displayed vertebral fractures and fusions and some crispants exhibited distinct quantitative variations in vertebral body measurements. This confirmed the role of the selected genes in skeletal development and homeostasis and their involvement in skeletal disease and established the crispant approach as a valid approach for rapidly providing in vivo gene function data to support candidate gene identification.’</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>(4) Several additional caveats to crispant analyses are worth noting:</p><p>(a) False negatives, i.e. individual fish may not carry many (or any!) mutant alleles. The crispant individuals used for most assays here were not directly genotyped, and no control appears to have been used to confirm successful injection. The authors therefore cannot rule out that some individuals were not, in fact, mutagenized at the loci of interest, potentially due to human error. While this doesn't invalidate the results, it is worth acknowledging the limitation.</p></disp-quote><p>We thank the reviewer for this valuable remark. We recognize the fact that working with crispants has certain limitations, including the possibility that some individuals may carry few or no mutant alleles. To address this issue, we use 10 individual crispants during the larval stage and 5 during the adult stage. Although some individuals may lack the mutant alleles, using multiple fish helps reduce the risk of false negatives.</p><p>Furthermore, we perform NGS analysis on pools of 10 embryos from the same injection clutch as the fish used in the various assays to assess the indel efficiency. While there remains a possibility of false negatives, the overall indel efficiency, as indicated by our NGS analysis, is high (&gt;90%), thereby reducing the likelihood of having crispants with very low indel efficiency. We included this in the discussion.</p><p>Line 387-390: ‘While there remains a possibility of false negatives, the overall indel efficiency, as indicated by our NGS analysis, is high (&gt;90%), thereby reducing the likelihood of having crispants with very low indel efficiency.’</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>(b) Many/most loci identified through GWAS are non-coding and not easily associated with a nearby gene. The authors should discuss whether their coding gene-focused pipeline could be applied in such cases and how that might work.</p></disp-quote><p>The authors thank the reviewer for this insightful comment. Our study is focused on strong candidate genes rather than non-coding variants. We recognize that the use of this workflow poses challenges for analyzing non-coding variants, which represents a limitation of the crispant approach.

The authors targeted six high-confident candidate genes implicated in severe recessive forms of FBDs and four Osteoporosis GWAS-implicated genes and observed varied developmental phenotypes across all crispants, in addition to adult skeletal phenotypes.</p><p>A major strength of the paper is the streamlined method that produced significant phenotypes for all candidate genes tested.</p></disp-quote><p>We would like to thank the reviewer for highlighting the strengths of our paper.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>A major weakness is a lack of new insights into underlying mechanisms that may contribute to disease phenotypes, nor any clear commonalities across gene sets. This was most evident in the qRT-PCR analysis of select skeletal developmental genes, which all showed varied changes in fold and direction, but with little insight into the implications of the results.</p></disp-quote><p>We thank the reviewer for this insightful remark. We want to emphasize that this study focusses on establishing a new screening method for candidate genes involved in FBDs, rather than investigating the underlying mechanisms contributing to disease phenotypes. However, to investigate the underlying mechanisms in these crispants, the creation of bona fide mutants is necessary. We have included this consideration in the discussion.</p><p>Furthermore, we acknowledge that the results for the larval stages exhibit variability, which can complicate the interpretation of these findings. This is particularly true for the RT-PCR analysis, where whole-body samples were used, raising the possibility that other tissues may influence the expression results. Therefore, our primary focus is on the adult stages, as all crispants display a skeletal phenotype at this age. We have elaborated on this point in the discussion.</p><p>Line 462-463: ‘Moreover, to explore the underlying mechanisms contributing to disease phenotypes, it is essential to establish stable knockout mutants derived from the crispants’.</p><p>Line 391-399: ‘In adult crispants, the skeletal phenotype was generally more penetrant.

It was surprising that all four GWAS candidate genes (which presumably were lower confidence) also produced a result.</p></disp-quote><p>We appreciate the reviewer’s comment. We would like to direct attention to the discussion section, where we offer a possible explanation for the observation that all four GWAS candidate genes produce a skeletal phenotype.</p><p>Line 460-410: 'The more pronounced and earlier phenotypes in these zebrafish crispants are most likely attributed to the quasi knock-out state of the studied genes, while more common less impactful variants in the same genes result in typical late-onset osteoporosis (Laine et al., 2013) . This phenomenon is also observed in knock-out mouse models for these genes (Melville et al., 2014)(Coughlin et al., 2019).’</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>These authors have previously demonstrated that crispants recapitulate skeletal phenotypes of stable mutant lines for a single gene, somewhat reducing the novelty of the study.</p></disp-quote><p>We thank the reviewer for this comment and appreciate their concern. We have indeed demonstrated that crispants can recapitulate the skeletal phenotypes observed in stable mutant lines for the osteoporosis gene LRP5. However, we would like to highlight that the current study represents the first large-scale screening of candidate genes associated with bone disorders, including genes related to both OI and osteoporosis.

It is however difficult to read in its present form.

However, we chose not to place the measurements that resulted in 'ns' for all crispants at the end of the table, as we believe it is important to track the evolution of the phenotype over time.

They are straightforward to reproduce, as well as cost- and time-effective. The strength of this approach lies in its use of simple, reproducible techniques that form the foundation for characterizing bone development. Although the candidate genes were chosen based on their putative links to bone quality, early skeletal phenotypes can already be observed during bone development.</p><p>The mineralized surface area of the total head and specific head structures was selected to evaluate the degree of mineralization in early skeletal development, as mineralization is a direct indicator of bone formation. Additionally, the osteoblast-positive surface areas were measured to provide insight into the formation of new skeletal tissue during early development. Osteoblasts, as active bone-forming cells, are essential for understanding bone growth and the dynamics of skeletal phenotypes.</p><p>Examples in the manuscript:</p><p>Line 212-214: ‘The osteoblast-positive areas in both the total head and the opercle were then quantified to gain insight into the formation of new skeletal tissue during early development.’</p><p>Line 221-223: ‘Subsequently, Alizarin Red S (ARS) staining was conducted on the same 7 and 14 dpf crispant zebrafish larvae in order to evaluate the degree of mineralization in the early skeletal structures.’</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>(2) Reword: The opercle bone is the earliest forming bone of the opercular series, and appears to be what the authors are referring to as the &quot;operculum&quot; at 7-14 dpf.

Is there evidence of skeletal expression in humans/zebrafish?</p></disp-quote><p>Supplementary Table 4 lists the selected human candidate genes with reported mutations and/or polymorphisms associated with both skeletal and non-skeletal phenotypes. The table also includes additional findings from studies in mice and zebrafish. An extra column was now added to indicate gene conservation between human and zebrafish. We consulted UniProt (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://www.uniprot.org">https://www.uniprot.org</ext-link>) and ZFIN (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://zfin.org">https://zfin.org</ext-link>) to assess the skeletal expression of these genes in human and zebrafish. All genes showed expression in the trabecular bone and/or bone marrow in humans, as well as in bone elements in zebrafish.

In the case of common disease and GWAS hits, how did authors narrow in on candidate genes (which often have Mbp-scale associated regions spanning multiple genes)? Further, what is the evidence that the mechanism of action of the GWAS variant is haploinsufficiency modeled by their crispant zebrafish?</p></disp-quote><p>We have kept Supplementary Table 4 in the supplementary material but have referred to it earlier in the manuscript’s introduction. Consequently, the table has been renumbered from ‘Supplementary Table 4’ to ‘Supplementary Table 1’.</p><p>The selection of genes potentially involved in the pathogenesis of osteoporosis is based on the data from the GWAS catalog, which annotates SNPs using the Ensemble mapping pipeline.

Four genes were selected for this screening method based on the criteria outlined in the results section.

However, previous experience suggests that relying on RNA expression to verify haploinsufficiency in zebrafish can be challenging. In zebrafish KO mutants, RT-qPCR often still detects gene transcripts, potentially due to incomplete nonsense-mediated decay (NMD) of the mutated mRNA, which may allow residual expression even in the absence of functional protein. As a more definitive approach, we prefer to use antibodies to confirm haploinsufficiency at the protein level. However, as the reviewer noted, generating and applying specific antibodies in zebrafish remains challenging.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>(5) Please indicate how parametric vs. non-parametric statistical tests were selected for datasets.</p></disp-quote><p>We initially selected the parametric unpaired t-test, assuming the data were normally distributed with similar variances between groups. We verified the assumption of equal variances using the F-test, which was not significant across all assays. However, we did not assess the normality of the data directly, meaning we cannot confirm the normality assumption required for the t-test. Given this, we have opted to use the non-parametric Mann-Whitney U test, which does not require assumptions of normality, to ensure the robustness of our statistical analyses. We changed the Figures, the figure legends and the text accordingly.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>(6) In the figures and tables, I recommend adding notation showing the grouping of the first four genes as GWAS osteoporosis, the next three genes as osteoblast differentiation, the next two genes as bone mineralization, and the final gene as collagen transport to orient the reader.

This would be particularly useful to include in Table 2.</p></disp-quote><p>Our primary objective is to assess the feasibility and reproducibility of the crispant screen rather than performing an in-depth pathway analysis or categorizing genes by biological processes. For this purpose, we have organized candidate genes based on their relevance to osteoporosis and Osteogenesis Imperfecta, without subdividing them further.
