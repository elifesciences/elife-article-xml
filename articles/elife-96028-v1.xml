However, the functions of these TF condensates in 3-Dimentional (3D) genome organization and gene regulation remain elusive. In response to methionine (met) starvation, budding yeast TF Met4 and a few co-activators, including Met32, induce a set of genes involved in met biosynthesis. Here, we show that the endogenous Met4 and Met32 form co-localized puncta-like structures in yeast nuclei upon met depletion. Recombinant Met4 and Met32 form mixed droplets with LLPS properties in vitro. In relation to chromatin, Met4 puncta co-localize with target genes, and at least a subset of these target genes is clustered in 3D in a Met4-dependent manner. A <italic>MET3pr</italic>-GFP reporter inserted near several native Met4-binding sites becomes co-localized with Met4 puncta and displays enhanced transcriptional activity. A Met4 variant with a partial truncation of an intrinsically disordered region (IDR) shows less puncta formation, and this mutant selectively reduces the reporter activity near Met4-binding sites to the basal level. Overall, these results support a model where Met4 and co-activators form condensates to bring multiple target genes into a vicinity with higher local TF concentrations, which facilitates a strong response to methionine depletion.</p></abstract><kwd-group kwd-group-type="author-keywords"><kwd>transcription factors</kwd><kwd>biological condensates</kwd><kwd>phase separation</kwd><kwd>3D genome</kwd><kwd>gene clustering</kwd><kwd>gene regulation</kwd></kwd-group><kwd-group kwd-group-type="research-organism"><title>Research organism</title><kwd><italic>S. cerevisiae</italic></kwd></kwd-group><funding-group><award-group id="fund1"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000057</institution-id><institution>National Institute of General Medical Sciences</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>R35 GM139654</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Bai</surname><given-names>Lu</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><award-group id="fund2"><funding-source><institution-wrap><institution-id institution-id-type="FundRef">http://dx.doi.org/10.13039/100000001</institution-id><institution>National Science Foundation</institution></institution-wrap></funding-source><award-id>MCB 2016266</award-id><principal-award-recipient><name><surname>Bai</surname><given-names>Lu</given-names></name></principal-award-recipient></award-group><funding-statement>The funders had no role in study design, data collection, and interpretation, or the decision to submit the work for publication.</funding-statement></funding-group><custom-meta-group><custom-meta specific-use="meta-only"><meta-name>Author impact statement</meta-name><meta-value>The condensates of activator Met4 are associated with 3D clustering of the <italic>MET</italic> regulon and its enhanced expression.</meta-value></custom-meta><custom-meta specific-use="meta-only"><meta-name>publishing-route</meta-name><meta-value>prc</meta-value></custom-meta></custom-meta-group></article-meta></front><body><sec id="s1" sec-type="intro"><title>Introduction</title><p>Chromosomes form extensive 3D contacts that can occur over long linear genomic distances (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib46">Misteli, 2020</xref>). A subset of these interactions, such as promoter–promoter or promoter–enhancer looping, is thought to play a central role in gene regulation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib54">Schoenfelder and Fraser, 2019</xref>). In some cases, multiple genes come together in 3D space to form ‘multi-gene clusters’, and these clusters often involve co-regulated genes responding to stress or other types of environmental cues, such as heat shock, starvation, virus infection, or developmental signals (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib22">Du and Bai, 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib39">Lim and Levine, 2021</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib60">Uyehara and Apostolou, 2023</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib68">Zhao and Faryabi, 2023</xref>). Evidence from imaging and genomic studies suggests that these gene clusters may be related to a phenomenon called ‘transcription factories’, where RNA polymerase II (Pol II), Mediator, and nascent transcripts coalesce into distinct foci (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib13">Carter et al., 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib56">Sutherland and Bickmore, 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib52">Rieder et al., 2012</xref>). Proteomic analysis of transcription factories showed that they are also enriched with other components in the transcription pathway, including transcription factors (TFs), histone modification enzymes, and chromatin remodelers (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib41">Lyons et al., 2023</xref>). Overall, these observations suggest that some co-regulated genes can physically cluster into sub-nuclear compartments with elevated local concentrations of transcription-related factors.</p><p>How multi-gene clusters are formed is not well understood. Since co-regulated genes are often activated by a common set of TFs, such clustering may be mediated by the DNA–protein and protein–protein interactions of the TFs. Recent studies showed that TFs like Gcn4, OCT4, and TAZ, as well as some co-factors such as the Mediator and histone-acetylation reader Brd4, tend to form biomolecular condensates through liquid–liquid phase separation (LLPS) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib62">Whyte et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib7">Boija et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib53">Sabari et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib40">Lu et al., 2020</xref>). In LLPS, multivalent interactions among proteins, often through their intrinsically disordered regions (IDRs), allow them to condense into liquid-like droplets that are separated from the aqueous phase (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib3">Banani et al., 2017</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib19">Dignon et al., 2020</xref>). The existence of TF/co-factor condensates is supportive of the ‘transcription factory’ model mentioned above where transcription-related factors are locally concentrated through LLPS. So far, LLPS of TFs and co-factors has often been studied in vitro using purified systems or in vivo with artificial induction. How these proteins behave in a chromatin context at the endogenous concentration, and more specifically, if they contribute to multi-gene cluster formation, is not very clear.</p><p>Another unresolved issue related to multi-gene clusters is their functional role in gene regulation. Earlier studies of gene clusters found a positive correlation between clustering and gene expression level (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib2">Apostolou and Thanos, 2008</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib26">Fullwood et al., 2009</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib37">Li et al., 2012</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib24">Fanucchi et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib66">Zhang and Bai, 2016</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib45">Mir et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib69">Zhu et al., 2021</xref>), but the mechanism of the phenomenon was not clear. This again may be related to TF/co-factor condensates: if a gene cluster is situated within a condensate, higher local concentrations of these factors can potentially enhance expression. This is proposed to be the case at super-enhancers, where the condensates of co-factors like Med1 and Brd4 are thought to drive the high transcriptional activities of the target genes. However, some reports studying TF condensates reveal a complex, sometimes contradictory, relation to gene expression, where the condensates are observed to have positive, negative, or neutral effects on transcription (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Chong et al., 2022</xref>). In a recent study of the <italic>GAL</italic> genes, for example, it is proposed that Gal4 condensation facilitates its recruitment to target genes but does not contribute to gene activation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib43">Meeussen et al., 2023</xref>). In general, the relation between TF condensates, multi-gene clustering, and gene regulation needs to be further studied.</p><p>Upon met depletion (−met) in budding yeast, Met4 is recruited by several sequence-specific DNA-binding co-activators, including Cbf1, Met31, and Met32, to bind and rapidly activate a subset of genes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib57">Thomas et al., 1992</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib35">Lee et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib51">Ouni et al., 2010</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib12">Carrillo et al., 2012</xref>). This activator complex is further stabilized by Met28 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib34">Kuras et al., 1997</xref>). In a previous study, we carried out a screen to probe long-distance gene regulation that affected <italic>MET3</italic> promoter (<italic>MET3pr</italic>) activity by inserting an insulated <italic>MET3pr-</italic>GFP reporter into many genomic loci and measuring GFP intensity in −met (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Du et al., 2017</xref>). At most locations, the reporter has comparable induction level; however, it shows enhanced activity at a small subset of loci, which were defined as ‘transcriptional hotspots’ (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib23">Du et al., 2017</xref>). These hotspots tend to be located near endogenous Met4 target genes, and 3C assay detects physical proximity among the hotspots. These results led to a hypothesis that hotspots occur at loci where <italic>MET</italic> genes cluster, and such clustering and transcriptional elevation may be both mediated by the condensates of related TFs.</p><p>In this study, we test the hypothesis above using a combination of biochemistry, genetics, genomics, and imaging approaches. We demonstrate that Met4 and Met32 form co-localized puncta in the yeast nuclei upon met depletion. Purified Met32 forms condensate with LLPS properties in vitro, with which Met4 can merge. In relation to chromatin, we show that the loci that are associated with the Met TFs co-localize with the Met4 puncta, and at least a subset of Met4 target genes cluster in 3D nuclear space in a Met4-dependent manner. Functionally, the <italic>MET3pr-GFP</italic> reporter inserted near the endogenous Met4 target sites shows higher enrichment of Met TFs/Pol II and enhanced transcriptional activity (hotspots). A Met4 IDR truncation that reduces Met4 puncta formation selectively affects the reporter activity at hotspots. Collectively, our results support a model where TFs in the met response pathway form LLPS condensates, organize multiple target genes in their vicinity, and enhance gene expression by creating a local environment with elevated concentrations of transcription-related factors. This may represent a common strategy for cells to concentrate limited resources to mount a strong response to stress.</p></sec><sec id="s2" sec-type="results"><title>Results</title><sec id="s2-1"><title>The trans-activator Met4 and its co-factor Met32 form puncta in the nucleus</title><p>Our previous study presented evidence that the ‘hotspots’ for <italic>MET3pr</italic> transcription may form 3D clusters, but the mechanisms of clustering and transcriptional elevation are unknown. Given the recent reports on TF condensation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib53">Sabari et al., 2018</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib40">Lu et al., 2020</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib67">Zhang et al., 2022</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib49">Okada et al., 2023</xref>), we hypothesize that these phenomena may be related to condensates formed by TFs in the <italic>MET</italic> pathway. To test this possibility, we labeled the endogenous Met4 protein with GFP and visualized Met4 in live cells under Airyscan confocal microscopy (Materials and methods; see <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="supp1">Supplementary file 1</xref> for strain list). We observed nuclear-localized Met4-GFP under both the repressed (+met) and activated (−met) conditions, with the latter showing higher intensity. Importantly, the Met4-GFP displays puncta-like structures, especially under −met (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1A</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1A</xref>). As controls, we constructed strains expressing a nuclear-localized free GFP or GFP fused to various chromatin-associated factors, including TFs Cbf1 and Reb1, and Sth1, a subunit of RSC nucleosome remodeler, which also bind chromatin with sequence specificity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib10">Cai and Davis, 1990</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib30">Ju et al., 1990</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib21">Donovan et al., 2023</xref>). The GFP signals appear more evenly distributed in these control strains (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1A</xref>). To evaluate the distribution more quantitatively, we calculated the coefficient of variance (CV) of the fluorescent intensities among the pixels inside each nucleus (Materials and methods, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="supp2">Supplementary file 2</xref>). Uneven distribution of the GFP molecules would result in large variations in the pixel intensities and higher CVs. The CVs of Met4-GFP in both ±met conditions are significantly higher than free GFP and other nuclear proteins (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1B</xref>). Since the strains in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1A</xref> express GFP at different levels, which directly affects CV, we also calculated the Fano number (variance divided by the mean) to control for this variable. Met4-GFP in the −met condition has the largest Fano number (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1C</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1B</xref>), which indicates that in the activated state it forms the most punctate structures. This data supports the notion that Met4 forms condensates in the nuclei upon activation.</p><fig-group><fig id="fig1" position="float"><label>Figure 1.</label><caption><title>The trans-activator Met4 and its co-factor Met32 form puncta in the nucleus.</title><p>(<bold>A</bold>) Representative images of Met4-GFP in ± methionine (met) conditions.

We imaged cells containing endogenous Met32 labeled with mCherry and compared its distribution to free mCherry. Unlike Met4, Met32-mCherry is barely visible in +met, and it is significantly upregulated in −met (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1D</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1C</xref>). In the latter condition, Met32-mCherry also shows uneven distribution with high CV and Fano number (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1E, F</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1D</xref>). We also imaged Met31-mCherry, but its concentration is too low to be detected. When Met4-GFP and Met32-mCherry are tagged in the same strain, their fluorescent signals largely overlap (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1G</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1s1">Figure 1—figure supplement 1E</xref>). To quantify the overlap, we extracted the GFP and mCherry fluorescence intensities for all the pixels inside each nucleus and calculated their correlation coefficient. As a control, we carried out the same analysis with co-expressed Sth1-GFP and Met32-mCherry, which appear to be less co-localized (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1G</xref>). Indeed, the Pearson correlation between Met4 and Met32 fluorescence on average was 0.75, much higher than that between Sth1 and Met32 (<italic>R</italic> = 0.19) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1H</xref>).

Since LLPS is often promoted by IDRs, we first performed PONDR analysis of Met4 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib63">Xue et al., 2010</xref>). This analysis reveals three distinct stretches of IDRs interspersed with two previously annotated functional domains: the activation domain (aa95–144), which interacts with Mediator, and the auxiliary domain (aa312–375), which interacts with Met31/32 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7A</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib32">Kuras and Thomas, 1995</xref>).

To probe the effect of these IDRs on Met4 puncta formation, we first truncated individual IDR stretches: ΔIDR1 (aa1–69), ΔIDR2 (aa117–359), or ΔIDR3 (aa397–651). As Met4 is essential for cell viability in the −met media, we constructed strains containing the endogenous unlabeled Met4 with an additional copy of truncated Met4-GFP driven by the native <italic>MET4</italic> promoter. This allows us to visualize Met4 mutants without hindering cell growth (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7B</xref>). Deletions of IDR2 and IDR3 both lead to significant reductions in Met4-GFP Fano number, with ΔIDR2 having a slightly more pronounced effect (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7B, C</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7s1">Figure 7—figure supplement 1A</xref>). Purified Met4-ΔIDR2 show less partitioning into the Met32 condensates (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7s1">Figure 7—figure supplement 1B</xref>), which may contribute to the decreased puncta formation.

Given our model and supporting evidence that Met4 condensates increase local TF concentration at Met4 targeted genes and enhance their expression, we expect a Met4 mutant less prone to condense will result in diminished Met4 binding and reduced induction. We therefore compared the ChIP-seq and RNA-seq data of the full-length vs truncated Met4. Consistent with the idea above, the Met4 ΔIDR2.3 shows decreased binding across all the previously annotated Met TF-binding sites, without generating new ChIP-seq peaks (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7D, E</xref>). Interestingly, the three Met4-binding sites near <italic>MUP1</italic>, <italic>STR3</italic>, and <italic>YKG9</italic> that cluster with <italic>MET6</italic> show significantly more reduction in Met4 ChIP-seq peaks (reduced to 42 ± 4%) than other Met4 sites (61 ± 8%, p value = 0.02) in the Met4 ΔIDR2.3 strain.

Importantly, our model also predicts that decreased Met4 condensation should have more impact on target genes that are located near Met4 puncta than those farther away. To test this idea, we again took advantage of the <italic>MET3pr</italic>-GFP reporter inserted into hotspots and basal loci. We expect the reduced Met4 condensation to have a larger impact on the reporter activity in the former case because the reporter is only associated with Met4 puncta at hotspots (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6B</xref>). Indeed, after substituting Met4 with Met4-ΔIDR2.3 in these strains, we observed strong decreases in the reporter gene activity in hotspots but minimal effect on those in basal regions (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig7">Figure 7G</xref>). These findings collectively support a model wherein Met4 condensates cluster target genes, enhance their activity, and give rise to the formation of transcriptional hotspots.</p></sec></sec><sec id="s3" sec-type="discussion"><title>Discussion</title><p>In this study, we investigated TF distribution, 3D genome organization, and gene activation in the met response pathway using a combination of genetics, genomics, and imaging approaches. Our findings connect three emerging phenomena in gene regulation: TF condensates, co-regulated gene clusters, and transcriptional hotspots. More specifically, we show that the activator Met4 and its co-factor Met32 form puncta-like structures that co-localize with at least some Met4 target genes. Multiple <italic>MET</italic> genes on different chromosomes cluster in the 3D nuclei space, and such clustering requires the presence of Met4. Chromosomal loci near endogenous Met4-binding sites, in one case within a 40-kb range, are hotspots for <italic>MET3pr</italic> reporter expression. Mutations that decrease Met4 puncta formation lead to selective reduction of the reporter transcriptional activity at the hotspots.</p><sec id="s3-1"><title>Condensate formation of Met4 and Met32</title><p>Using live-cell imaging, we found that fluorescently labeled Met4 and Met32 from puncta-like structures in yeast nuclei under the −met condition. This is reflected by the higher Fano numbers in Met4/Met32 pixel intensities in comparison to free GFP, and in the case of Met4, other chromatin-associated factors. Although Met4 can form smaller puncta in the +met condition (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1A</xref>), it cannot be recruited to its target genes due to the absence of its sequence-specific binding partners and therefore does not have 3D genome organization and gene regulatory functions. High-resolution microscopy of yeast TFs is challenging due to the small size of the nuclei. The low intensities of the Met4/Met32 signals require high excitation for imaging, which also makes them prone to photobleaching. Thus, we were unable to measure Met4 and Met32 puncta dynamics in vivo. When purified in vitro, Met32-mCherry readily forms droplets with typical LLPS properties without molecular crowder, while His- and MBP-tagged Met4 remain diffusive at physiological salt concentration. We also found that Met4 partitions into the Met32 droplets when they are mixed, and inside cells, the two factors show significant co-localization. These observations raise the intriguing possibility that Met32 serves as a scaffold to nucleate the co-condensates of Met4 and other Met TFs. This may explain why Met4 distribution becomes more puncta-like when switched from +met to −met condition, when Met32 becomes available inside the nuclei. However, we cannot exclude the possibility that the absence of Met4 LLPS is due to our in vitro condition (tag, impurity, lack of post-translational modification, etc.). Met4 is reported to recruit its co-factors including Mediator and SAGA complex (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib36">Leroy et al., 2006</xref>), and these factors, together with Pol II and RNA, may affect Met4 condensate formation in vivo (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib28">Henninger et al., 2021</xref>).</p></sec><sec id="s3-2"><title>TF condensates and 3D genome topology</title><p>TF condensation in vivo occurs in a chromatin context, but the relationship between TF condensates and 3D genome topology has not been extensively studied. By recruiting multiple TFs, Mediator, and transcription machineries into proximity, TF-binding loci can potentially serve as nucleation sites for transcription condensates. Looped enhancers and promoters, as well as clustered genes, may also function as scaffold and stabilize these condensates. This is best illustrated at super-enhancers, where clustered enhancer sites tend to associate with transcriptional condensates and lead to very high activities of their target genes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib29">Hnisz et al., 2013</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib53">Sabari et al., 2018</xref>). Synthetic LacO array and endogenous microsatellite repeats were also shown to promote local condensation of associated TFs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib15">Chong et al., 2018</xref>). Reversely, TF condensates can mediate long-distance chromosomal interactions by contacting multiple genomic sites and therefore inducing their 3D proximity. This idea is supported by the findings here: (1) multiple Met4-targeted genes are co-localized with Met4 condensates, (2) at least a subset of Met4-targeted genes form clusters with long-distance intra- and inter-chromosomal interactions, and (3) such clustering only occurs in −met activating condition in the presence of Met4. Similar observations were made during yeast heat shock response, where the activator Hsf1 coalesces and mediates transient clustering and activation of heat shock genes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib17">Chowdhary et al., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib18">Chowdhary et al., 2022</xref>). A few mammalian TFs were also shown to contribute to 3D genome conformation. For example, YAP/TAZ organizes their target sites into clusters that co-localize with the YAP/TAZ/TEAD1 condensates (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib40">Lu et al., 2020</xref>). NUP98-HOXA9, a chimeric TF related to the pathogenesis of AML, was also shown to mediate long-distance chromosomal loops between NUP98-HOXA9-bound enhancers and oncogenes into SE-like clusters (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib1">Ahn et al., 2021</xref>).</p><p>Interestingly, a <italic>MET3pr</italic> reporter that is associated and activated by Met4 only co-localizes with Met4 puncta when inserted near native Met4-binding sites. Also, adding <italic>MET3pr</italic> reporter gene into these sites does not further increase the local Met4 concentration (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">Figure 6B, C</xref>). These observations indicate that Met4 binding is not <italic>sufficient</italic> for a gene to nucleate or be recruited into a Met4 condensate. The underlying mechanism of this observation is unclear, but we speculate that some properties of the endogenous <italic>MET</italic> genes may facilitate their clustering with Met4 puncta. For example, some <italic>MET</italic> genes, like <italic>MET13</italic> and <italic>MET6</italic>, are associated with nuclear pore complex (NPC) even in the presence of met (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib25">Forey et al., 2021</xref>). The tethering by NPCs may increase the chance for these genes to come into proximity, enhancing the local density of Met4 target sites to nucleate the Met4 condensates. In contrast, a reporter gene inserted into random genomic locations may not be optimally positioned to contact NPC and/or other Met4 target genes. Further experiments are required to test these ideas. Notably, interaction with NPC was found to be necessary and sufficient to promote clustering of the <italic>GAL1-10</italic> alleles (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib8">Brickner et al., 2016</xref>).</p></sec><sec id="s3-3"><title>TF condensates and gene expression</title><p>The Met4 condensates represent a local environment with elevated Met4 concentrations, which can promote Met4 binding and lead to enhanced gene expression. Consistent with this idea, a <italic>MET3pr</italic> reporter inserted near these Met4 targets, which also co-localizes with the Met4 puncta, shows increased transcriptional activity. Near <italic>MET6</italic>, such hyperactivity of the reporter occurs over a 40-kb range. According to previous measurement (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib9">Bystricky et al., 2004</xref>), 40 kb linear chromatin explores a 3D space with ~200 nm diameter, which may reflect the size of the Met4 condensates. The elevation of transcription level is pathway specific, as <italic>GAL1Spr-</italic>GFP inserted into the same loci does not show the same effect. This finding agrees with the ‘specialized transcription factory’ previously proposed (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib4">Bartlett et al., 2006</xref>) and argues against a model where the transcription elevation solely relies on general TFs like Mediator or transcription machinery.</p><p>The relation between Met4 condensation and transcriptional activity is further supported by Met4 ΔIDR2.3. This Met4 mutant, in comparison to full-length Met4, reduces the Met4 puncta formation and the activities of most of its target genes in the genome. Importantly, ΔIDR2.3 does not have strong effect on the transcriptional activity of <italic>MET3pr</italic> reporter inserted into basal loci, suggesting that this truncation does not directly impact Met4 integrity and its activation function. Instead, it selectively reduces reporter activity at transcriptional hotspots, consistent with the idea that such reduction is due to the disruption of Met4 condensates.</p><p>In terms of mechanism, we speculate that (1) high Met4 local concentration inside the condensates may increase the binding rate of Met4, and/or (2) multivalent interactions among Met4, Met32, and possibly other co-activators may slow down the dissociation of Met4 from its target genes. Both ideas are consistent with our observation that Met4 ΔIDR2.3 shows less binding than the full-length Met4. The same mechanism has been proposed for other TF condensates, and in some cases, it is supported by direct kinetic evidence (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib59">Trojanowski et al., 2022</xref>). It should be noted that more TF binding does not necessarily lead to an increase in gene expression level, for example, transcription may be limited by a step downstream of TF binding. Consistent with this idea, a recent study reports that Gal4 condensation facilitates its recruitment to target genes but does not contribute to gene activation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib43">Meeussen et al., 2023</xref>). In human cells, artificially enhanced condensation of a TF EWS::FLI1 causes sequestering of this TF into the nucleolus, resulting in decreased expression of their target genes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib16">Chong et al., 2022</xref>). This indicates that the exact relation between TF condensates and gene expression relies on the nature of the multivalent interaction, location of condensate formation, transcription kinetics, etc., and it needs to be analyzed on a case-by-case basis.</p></sec><sec id="s3-4"><title>TF condensates and stress response</title><p>The sulfur-containing amino acid methionine is a key metabolite for cell survival, and its depletion represents a major stress for budding yeast. Interestingly, the TFs that were found to form condensates in yeast, include Met4, Gal4, and Hsf1, all respond to certain types of environmental stress. Similar observations are made in higher eukaryotes. For example, YAP forms condensates in response to osmotic stress (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib11">Cai et al., 2019</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib40">Lu et al., 2020</xref>), and phyB in plants uses altered LLPS properties to sense light and temperature cues (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib14">Chen et al., 2022</xref>). In contrast, constitutive TFs in yeast, like Reb1, Cbf1, and Sth1, are more evenly distributed in the nuclei (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig1">Figure 1</xref>). The condensation of stress-responding TFs may reflect a functional need to rapidly concentrate related resources into a subset of the nuclear space for more efficient usage. In the case of Met4, its condensates indeed allow yeast cells to mount a stronger response to met depletion. In addition, TF condensates may accelerate TF target search and response rate, facilitate synchronized expression of target genes, and/or enhance the activation specificity. These potential condensate functions need to be further explored.</p></sec></sec><sec id="s4" sec-type="materials|methods"><title>Materials and methods</title><sec id="s4-1"><title>Plasmid and strain construction</title><p>Standard molecular methods were used to construct budding yeast strains and plasmids (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="supp1">Supplementary file 1</xref>).

For single-cell fluorescent images, the images were taken with Airyscan detector and deconvoluted with Zen Black software.</p><p>The individual nuclei from single cells were segmented to extract the nuclear boundaries and pixel fluorescent information of single nuclei with NucleiSplicer (Matlab) and subsequent nuclei information was analyzed with NucleiAnalyzer (Matlab). Variance and standard deviation were calculated from the nuclear pixels and plotted with OriginPro (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="supp2">Supplementary file 2</xref>). The mean GFP intensities were calculated by subtracting the measure GFP intensities by the mean background intensities of unlabeled cells. Coefficient of variation (CV) values were calculated by dividing the Std. Dev by the mean GFP values for individual cells. The Fano number was calculated by dividing the variance by the mean GFP. To normalize the Fano number, the mean Fano number of Free GFP was set to a value of 1 and the rest of the conditions were divided by the mean GFP Fano number (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="supp2">Supplementary file 2</xref>).</p><p>Single-cell images of yeast cells expressing tetR-mCherry and Met4-GFP were imaged with 10 z-stacks (0.4 µm). The z-stack images of mCherry and GFP channels were analyzed by DotTracker (MATLAB). For individual cells, the program detects the z-stack with the highest mCherry dot intensity. We then either used the GFP image from the same z position (same z) or projected the highest GFP intensity at each pixel for all z positions onto a 2D plane (MIP). The MIP images were aligned with the mCherry dot at the center and averaged among all cells. To calculate the GFP intensities like in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig3">Figures 3G</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="fig6">6C</xref>, a single line was drawn across the center and the GFP profile was analyzed by ImageJ.</p><p>To measure <italic>S.kud</italic> Met3pr-GFP expression, yeast cells were grown in SCD +10x Met liquid media at 30°C to OD<sub>660</sub> ~0.2, washed, and then transferred onto a SCD-Met agarose pad for induction. After 6 hr, the agarose pad was put under a Leica DMI6000 B fluorescent microscope for imaging. The GFP fluorescent intensity within each cell boundary was quantified using Celltracker4 (MATLAB) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib70">Zou and Bai, 2019</xref>).</p></sec><sec id="s4-3"><title>Met4 and Met32 purification</title><p>Constructs of Met32-mCherry, and Met4-MBP were inserted into pET28b(+) backbones with an N-terminus 6x-His tag. Met4 and Met32 genes were cloned from budding yeast genomic DNA. MBP-tag was cloned from Addgene CAT#98651 and fusion constructs were assembled using 2xHiFi mastermix (NEB #E2621L) and transformed into DH5α cells (NEB C2987). A single cysteine sequence was added to the linker between Met4 and MBP to facilitate maleimide conjugation of fluorophores for imaging. For protein expression, all plasmids were transformed into BL21(DE3)-Sigma32 cells (courtesy of Xin Zhang) and induced according to reported protocol for the Sigma32 cell line (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="bib65">Zhang et al., 2014</xref>). Bacterial protein expression was carried out with cells grown in LB supplemented with 50 mg/L kanamycin and 100 mg/L ampicillin at 37°C to OD<sub>600</sub> = 0.3, induced with 2 g/L arabinose (TCI A0515).

Met32-mCherry was purified using Ni-NTA chromatography (Thermo Scientific HisPur resin #88222) with proteins buffers A (20 mM Tris pH 8.0, 400 mM NaCl, 5 mM imidazole) and B (20 mM Tris pH 8.0, 400 mM NaCl, 250 mM imidazole) with a stepwise gradient of buffer B. Protein was buffer exchanged into buffer C (20 mM HEPES pH 7.5, 400 mM NaCl, 10% glycerol, 1 mM DTT) and concentrated to at least 80 mM using Amicon Pro centrifugal filters 10,000 NMWL (Milipore #ACS501024). The Met4 construct was purified using Ni-NTA chromatography with proteins buffers A and B with a stepwise gradient of buffer B. Ni-NTA elution was immediately loaded onto an amylose column (NEB E8021S) and purified using a stepwise gradient of buffers A and D (20 mM Tris pH 8.0, 400 mM NaCl, 10 mM maltose). Protein was labeled by incubating with 0.8 molar equivalents of Alexa Flour 488 maleimide (Invitrogen A10254). Proteins were buffer exchanged into buffer C and concentrated to less than 50 mM (to avoid aggregation).</p></sec><sec id="s4-4"><title>Western blot analysis of recombinant proteins</title><p>Met4-MBP samples were run on a 4–20% SDS–PAGE gel (Bio-Rad #4561094). Gels were wet transferred to a Polyvinylidene fluoride (PVDF) membrane (Bio-Rad #1620177) at 80 V for 3 hr in Tris–glycine buffer. Transfer was confirmed by Ponceau staining (Sigma P7170-1L). Membrane was blocked with 5% non-fat milk, washed with Tris-buffer saline (TBS) with 1% Tween 20 (VWR 0777). Membrane was probed with anti-MBP antibody (Thermo Fisher MA527544). Membrane was stripped using PVDF stripping solution (DOT Scientific 65000-500) according to the instruction’s and reprobed with anti-6x-His primary antibody (Thermo Fisher MA1-21315) and conducted identically to the first probing.

All droplet formation and imaging was conducted at room temperature.</p></sec><sec id="s4-6"><title>Fluorescent recovery after photobleaching</title><p>Bleaching was conducted after three frames using the 594 nm laser at full power for 45 iterations. Fluorescence intensity was monitored every 3 s for a total of 270 s per experiment. Fluorescence intensity levels were extracted using Zeiss Zen Black software. Fluorescence intensity was normalized to percent of pre-bleach intensity then averaged. Error bars show ± SD of the normalized fluorescence intensity. FRAP experiments were conducted at 20 µM Met32-mCherry. Experiments were replicated with at least three preparations of each protein.

This study represents a second clear example of inducible transcriptional condensates in budding yeast, as most evidence for transcriptional condensates arises from studies of mammalian systems. In addition, this study links the genomic location of transcriptional condensates to the potency of transcription of a reporter gene regulated by the master transcription factor contained in the condensate. The strength of evidence supporting these two conclusions is strong. Less strong is evidence supporting the claim that Met4-containing condensates mediate the clustering of genes in the MET regulon.</p><p>Strengths:</p><p>The manuscript is for the most part clearly written, with the overriding model and specific hypothesis being tested clearly explained. Figure legends are particularly well written. An additional strength of the manuscript is that most of the main conclusions are supported by the data. This includes the propensity of Met4 and Met32 to form puncta-like structures under inducing conditions, formation of Met32-containing LLPS-like droplets in vitro (within which Met4 can colocalize), colocalization of Met4-GFP with Met4-target genes under inducing conditions, enhanced transcription of a Met3pr-GFP reporter when targeted within 1.5 - 5 kb of select Met4 target genes, and most impressively, evidence that several MET genes appear to reposition under transcriptionally inducing conditions. The latter is based on a recently reported novel in vivo methylation assay, MTAC, developed by the Bai lab.</p><p>Comments on Revision:</p><p>The authors have adequately addressed most of my concerns. However, the most salient issue - that the work fails to show convincing evidence that nuclear condensates per se drive MET gene clustering - remains. Since the genetic approach led to ambiguous results, another way to link MET gene clustering to TF condensate formation is to perturb the condensates with 1,6-hexanediol. If 1,6-HD treatment dissolves condensates and concomitant MET clustering (while the impact of 2,5-HD is much less) then the conclusion is more solid. Absent such evidence, the authors are left with a correlation, and they should consider toning down the title and abstract (and conclusions stated elsewhere). For example, a more accurate title might be &quot;Transcription Factor Condensates Correlate with MET Gene Clustering and Mediate Enhancement in Gene Expression&quot;.</p></body></sub-article><sub-article article-type="referee-report" id="sa2"><front-stub><article-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.96028.3.sa2</article-id><title-group><article-title>Reviewer #2 (Public review):</article-title></title-group><contrib-group><contrib contrib-type="author"><anonymous/><role specific-use="referee">Reviewer</role></contrib></contrib-group></front-stub><body><p>Summary:</p><p>This manuscript combines live yeast cell imaging and other genomic approaches to study how transcription factor (TF) condensates might help organize and enhance the transcription of the target genes in the methionine starvation response pathway.

The importance of TFs is shown by rapid degradation. Single cell data are combined with genomic sequencing-based assays. Control loci engineered in the same way are usually included.

TF IDRs may have many functions including mediating phase separation and binding to other transcriptional molecules (not limited to proteins). The authors did not get clear results on gene clustering upon IDR deletion. IDR deletion may affect binding of other molecules (not the general transcription machinery) that are specifically important for target gene transcription. If the self-association of the IDR is the main driving force of the clustering and target gene transcription enhancement, replacing this IDR with totally unrelated IDRs that have been shown to mediate phase separation in non-transcription systems would preserve the gene clustering and transcription enhancement effects. However, this type of replacement experiment is challenging for endogenous locus.</p></body></sub-article><sub-article article-type="referee-report" id="sa3"><front-stub><article-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.96028.3.sa3</article-id><title-group><article-title>Reviewer #3 (Public review):</article-title></title-group><contrib-group><contrib contrib-type="author"><anonymous/><role specific-use="referee">Reviewer</role></contrib></contrib-group></front-stub><body><p>Summary:</p><p>In this study, the authors probe the connections between clustering of the Met4/32 transcription factors (TFs), clustering of their regulatory targets, and transcriptional regulation. While there is an increasing number of studies on TF clustering in vitro and in vivo, there is an important need to probe whether clustering plays a functional role in gene expression. Another important question is whether TF clustering leads to the clustering of relevant gene targets in vivo. Here the authors provide several lines of evidence to make a compelling case that Met4/32 and their target genes cluster and that this leads to an increase in transcription of these genes in the induced state. First, they found that, in the induced state, Met4/32 forms co-localized puncta in vivo. This is supported by in vitro studies showing that these TFs can form condensates in vitro with Med32 being the driver of these condensates. They found that two target genes, MET6 and MET13 have a higher probability of being co-localized with Met4 puncta compared with non-target loci. Using a targeted DNA methylation assay, they found that MET13 and MET6 show Met4-dependent long-range interactions with other Met4-regulated loci, consistent with the clustering of at least some target genes under induced conditions. Finally, by inserting a Met4-regulated reporter gene at variable distances from MET6, they provide evidence that insertion near this gene is a modest hotspot for activity.</p><p>Comments on revised version:</p><p>In this revised manuscript, the authors have achieved a good balance between revising the text/figures, and explaining why some lines of experiments proposed by reviewers are either not practical or beyond the scope of this work. I think that the revised study is an important contribution to understanding the function of transcription factors, TF condensates, and gene localization in a stress-responsive system.</p></body></sub-article><sub-article article-type="author-comment" id="sa4"><front-stub><article-id pub-id-type="doi">10.7554/eLife.96028.3.sa4</article-id><title-group><article-title>Author response</article-title></title-group><contrib-group><contrib contrib-type="author"><name><surname>Lee</surname><given-names>James</given-names></name><role specific-use="author">Author</role><aff><institution>Pennsylvania State University</institution><addr-line><named-content content-type="city">University Park</named-content></addr-line><country>United States</country></aff></contrib><contrib contrib-type="author"><name><surname>Simpson</surname><given-names>Leman</given-names></name><role specific-use="author">Author</role><aff><institution>Pennsylvania State University</institution><addr-line><named-content content-type="city">University Park</named-content></addr-line><country>United States</country></aff></contrib><contrib contrib-type="author"><name><surname>Li</surname><given-names>Yi</given-names></name><role specific-use="author">Author</role><aff><institution>Pennsylvania State University</institution><addr-line><named-content content-type="city">University Park</named-content></addr-line><country>United States</country></aff></contrib><contrib contrib-type="author"><name><surname>Becker</surname><given-names>Samuel</given-names></name><role specific-use="author">Author</role><aff><institution>Pennsylvania State University</institution><addr-line><named-content content-type="city">University Park</named-content></addr-line><country>United States</country></aff></contrib><contrib contrib-type="author"><name><surname>Zou</surname><given-names>Fan</given-names></name><role specific-use="author">Author</role><aff><institution>Pennsylvania State University</institution><addr-line><named-content content-type="city">University Park</named-content></addr-line><country>United States</country></aff></contrib><contrib contrib-type="author"><name><surname>Zhang</surname><given-names>Xin</given-names></name><role specific-use="author">Author</role><aff><institution>Westlake University</institution><addr-line><named-content content-type="city">Hangzhou</named-content></addr-line><country>China</country></aff></contrib><contrib contrib-type="author"><name><surname>Bai</surname><given-names>Lu</given-names></name><role specific-use="author">Author</role><aff><institution>Pennsylvania State University</institution><addr-line><named-content content-type="city">University Park</named-content></addr-line><country>United States</country></aff></contrib></contrib-group></front-stub><body><p>The following is the authors’ response to the original reviews.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p><bold>Public Reviews:</bold></p><p><bold>Reviewer #1 (Public Review):</bold></p><p>Summary:</p><p>In this study, James Lee, Lu Bai, and colleagues use a multifaceted approach to investigate the relationship between transcription factor condensate formation, transcription, and 3D gene clustering of the MET regulon in the model organism <italic>S. cerevisiae</italic>. This study represents a second clear example of inducible transcriptional condensates in budding yeast, as most evidence for transcriptional condensates arises from studies of mammalian systems. In addition, this study links the genomic location of transcriptional condensates to the potency of transcription of a reporter gene regulated by the master transcription factor contained in the condensate. The strength of evidence supporting these two conclusions is strong. Less strong is evidence supporting the claim that Met4-containing condensates mediate the clustering of genes in the MET regulon.</p><p>Strengths:</p><p>The manuscript is for the most part clearly written, with the overriding model and specific hypothesis being tested clearly explained. Figure legends are particularly well written. An additional strength of the manuscript is that most of the main conclusions are supported by the data. This includes the propensity of Met4 and Met32 to form puncta-like structures under inducing conditions, formation of Met32-containing LLPS-like droplets in vitro (within which Met4 can colocalize), colocalization of Met4-GFP with Met4-target genes under inducing conditions, enhanced transcription of a Met3pr-GFP reporter when targeted within 1.5 - 5 kb of select Met4 target genes, and most impressively, evidence that several MET genes appear to reposition under transcriptionally inducing conditions. The latter is based on a recently reported novel in vivo methylation assay, MTAC, developed by the Bai lab.</p><p>Weaknesses:</p><p>My principal concern is that the authors fail to show convincing evidence for a key conclusion, highlighted in the title, that nuclear condensates per se drive MET gene clustering. Figure 4E demonstrates that Met4 molecules, not condensates per se, are necessary for fostering distant cis and trans interactions between MET6 and three other Met4 targets under -met inducing conditions. In addition, the paper would be strengthened by discussing a recent study conducted in yeast that comes to many of the same conclusions reported here, including the role of inducible TF condensates in driving 3D genome reorganization (Chowdhary et al, Mol. Cell 2022).</p></disp-quote><p>Following the reviewer’s advice, we carried out MTAC with the VP near <italic>MET6</italic> in WT Met4 and ΔIDR2.3 strains (results shown below). The conclusions are somewhat ambiguous. For long-distance interactions with <italic>MUP1</italic>, <italic>YKG9</italic>, <italic>STR3</italic>, and <italic>MET13</italic>, we indeed observe decreased MTAC signals close to background levels in the ΔIDR2.3 strain, which aligns with the model suggesting that Met4 condensation promotes clustering among Met4 targeted genes. However, we also noticed significant decreases in the local MTAC signals (<italic>HIS3</italic> and <italic>MET6</italic>). It is possible that the changes in Met4 condensates alter the chromosomal folding near <italic>MET6</italic>, thereby affecting the local MTAC signals. Alternatively, LacI-M.CviPI (the methyltransferase) could be induced to a lesser extent in the ΔIDR2.3 strain, leading to a genome-wide decrease in MTAC signals. Due to this ambiguity, we decided not to include the following plot in the main figure.</p><fig id="sa4fig1" position="float"><label>Author response image 1.</label><graphic mimetype="image" mime-subtype="tiff" xlink:href="elife-96028-sa4-fig1-v1.tif"/></fig><p>We discussed Hsf1 and added the suggested reference on page 13.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Other concerns:</p><p>(1) A central premise of the study is that the inducible formation of condensates underpins the induction of MET gene transcription and MET gene clustering. Yet, Figure 1 suggests (and the authors acknowledge) that puncta-like Met4-containing structures pre-exist in the nuclei of non-induced cells. Thus, the transcription and gene reorganization observed is due to a relatively modest increase in condensate-like structures. Are we dealing with two different types of Met4 condensates? (For example, different combinations of Met4 with its partners; Mediator- or Pol II-lacking vs. Mediator- or Pol II-containing; etc.?) At the very least, a comment to this effect is necessary.</p></disp-quote><p>Although Met4 can form smaller puncta in the +met condition (Figure 1A), it cannot be recruited to its target genes due to the absence of its sequence-specific binding partners, Met31 and Met32 (these two factors are actively degraded in the +met condition). Consistently, in the +met condition, Met4 shows extremely low genome-wide ChIP signals (Figure 3C). Therefore, these Met4 puncta in +met do not have organize the 3D genome or have gene regulatory functions. This discussion is added on page 12.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>(2) Using an in vitro assay, the authors demonstrate that Met4 colocalizes with Met32 LLPS droplets (Figure 2F). Is the same true in vivo - that is, is Met32 required for Met4 condensation? This could be readily tested using auxin-induced degradation of Met32. Along similar lines, the claim that Met32 is required for MET gene clustering (line 250) requires auxin-induced degradation of this protein.</p></disp-quote><p>As the reviewer pointed out above, cells in the +met condition also show small Met4 puncta. In this condition, Met32 is essentially undetectable (Met31 level is even lower and remains undetectable even in the -met conditions). Therefore, Met4 does not strictly require the presence of Met32 <italic>in vivo</italic> (may require other factors or modifications). Met4 does not have DNA-binding activity, and therefore it cannot target and organize chromosomes on its own. Although we did not do the Met32 degradation experiment, we measured the 3D genome conformation in +met and showed that there are no detectable interactions among Met4 target genes.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>(3) The authors use a single time point during -met induction (2 h) to evaluate TF clustering, transcription (mRNA abundance), and 3D restructuring. It would be informative to perform a kinetic analysis since such an analysis could reveal whether TF clustering precedes transcriptional induction or MET gene repositioning. Do the latter two phenomena occur concurrently or does one precede the other?</p></disp-quote><p>We appreciate the reviewer’s insightful question. It is indeed intriguing to consider whether TF clustering precedes transcriptional induction and MET gene clustering. However, as mentioned on page 12 of our manuscript, this experiment poses significant challenges. The low intensities of the Met4 and Met32 signals necessitate high excitation for imaging, which also makes them prone to photo-bleaching. Consequently, we have been unable to measure the dynamics of Met4 and Met32 puncta in vivo, let alone co-image them with DNA/RNA. Undertaking this experiment will require considerable effort, which we plan to pursue in the future.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>(4) Based on the MTAC assay, MET13 does not appear to engage in trans interactions with other Met4 targets, whereas MET6 does (Figures 4C and 4E). Does this difference stem from the greater occupancy of Met4 at MET6 vs. MET13, greater association of another Met co-factor with the chromatin of MET6 vs. MET13, or something else?</p></disp-quote><p>We were also surprised by this result, given that <italic>MET13</italic> emerged as one of the strongest transcriptional hotspots in our previous screen. It also exhibits one of the highest Met4 ChIP signals and is closely associated with the nuclear pore complex. Our earlier findings indicate that DNA dynamics near the VP significantly influence the MTAC signal; specifically, a VP with constrained motion is less effective at methylating interacting sites (Li et al., 2024). Therefore, it is plausible that <italic>MET13</italic> is associated with a large Met4 condensate, which constrains the motion of nearby chromatin and diminishes MTAC efficiency.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p><bold>Reviewer #2 (Public Review):</bold></p><p>Summary:</p><p>This manuscript combines live yeast cell imaging and other genomic approaches to study how transcription factor (TF) condensates might help organize and enhance the transcription of the target genes in the methionine starvation response pathway. The authors show that the TFs in this response can form phase-separated condensates through their intrinsically disordered regions (IDRs), and mediate the spatial clustering of the related endogenous genes as well as reporter inserted near the endogenous target loci.</p><p>Strengths:</p><p>This work uses rigorous experimental approaches, such as imaging of endogenously labeled TFs, determining expression and clustering of endogenous target genes, and reporter integration near the endogenous target loci. The importance of TFs is shown by rapid degradation. Single-cell data are combined with genomic sequencing-based assays. Control loci engineered in the same way are usually included. Some of these controls are very helpful in showing the pathway-specific effect of the TF condensates in enhancing transcription.</p><p>Weaknesses:</p><p>Perhaps the biggest weakness of this work is that the role of IDR and phase separation in mediating the target gene clustering is unclear. This is an important question. TF IDRs may have many functions including mediating phase separation and binding to other transcriptional molecules (not limited to proteins and may even include RNAs). The effect of IDR deletion on reduced Fano number in cells could come from reduced binding with other molecules. This should be tested on phase separation of the purified protein after IDR deletion. Also, the authors have not shown IDR deletion affects the clustering of the target genes, so IDR deletion may affect the binding of other molecules (not the general transcription machinery) that are specifically important for target gene transcription. If the self-association of the IDR is the main driving force of the clustering and target gene transcription enhancement, can one replace this IDR with totally unrelated IDRs that have been shown to mediate phase separation in non-transcription systems and still see the gene clustering and transcription enhancement effects? This work has all the setup to test this hypothesis.</p></disp-quote><p>We thank the reviewer for raising this point, and we tried more in vitro and in vivo experiments with Met4 IDR deletions. See the answer to Reviewer 1 for the in vivo 3D mapping experiment.</p><p>We purified Met4-ΔIDR2 with an MBP tag, but its low yield made labeling and conducting thorough experiments challenging. At concentrations above ~10 μM, the protein tends to aggregate, while at lower concentrations, it remains diffusive in solution and does not form condensates. When we mixed purified Met4-ΔIDR2 with Met32, we observed reduced partitioning inside Met32 condensates compared to the full-length Met4. As the reviewer noted, this diminished interaction may contribute to the decreased puncta formation observed <italic>in vivo</italic>. This result is added to the manuscript on page 11 and supplementary figure 5.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>The Met4 protein was tagged with MBP but Met 32 was not. MBP tag is well known to enhance protein solubility and prevent phase separation. This made the comparison of their in vitro phase behavior very different and led the authors to think that maybe Met32 is the scaffold in the co-condensates. If MBP was necessary to increase yield and solubility during expression and purification, it should be cleaved (a protease cleavage site should be engineered) to allow phase separation in vitro.</p></disp-quote><p>Following the reviewer’s advice, we purified Met4-TEV-MBP so that the MBP can be cleaved off. Unfortunately, concentrated Met4-TEV-MBP needs to be stored at high salt (400mM) to be soluble. When exchanged into a suitable buffer for TEV cleavage (≤200 mM NaCl), nearly all soluble protein aggregates. Attempts to digest the protein in storage buffer results in observable aggregation before significant cleavage (see below).</p><fig id="sa4fig2" position="float"><label>Author response image 2.</label><graphic mimetype="image" mime-subtype="tiff" xlink:href="elife-96028-sa4-fig2-v1.tif"/></fig><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>Are ATG36 and LDS2 also supposed to be induced by -met? This should be explained clearly. The signals are high at -met.</p></disp-quote><p>Genomic loci ATG36 and LDS2 were chosen as controls because they are not bound by Met TFs (ChIP-seq tracks) and their expressions are not induced by -met (RNA-seq data).

The authors should probably quantify the signals from a large number of randomly selected pictures (cells) and do statistics.</p></disp-quote><p>If we understand this comment correctly, the reviewer is referring to the fact that all three loci in Figure 6B appear to show a peak in GFP intensity. This pattern emerges because these images are averaged among many cells (number of cells analyzed in 6B has been added to the Figure legends). GFP intensities near the center will always be higher because peripheral pixels are more likely to fall outside the nuclei boundaries, where Met4 signals are absent (same as in Figure 3F). Importantly, <italic>MET6</italic> locus shows higher intensity near the center in comparison to <italic>PUT1</italic> and <italic>ATG36</italic>, indicating its co-localization with Met4 condensates.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p><bold>Reviewer #3 (Public Review):</bold></p><p>Summary:</p><p>In this study, the authors probe the connections between clustering of the Met4/32 transcription factors (TFs), clustering of their regulatory targets, and transcriptional regulation. While there is an increasing number of studies on TF clustering in vitro and in vivo, there is an important need to probe whether clustering plays a functional role in gene expression. Another important question is whether TF clustering leads to the clustering of relevant gene targets in vivo. Here the authors provide several lines of evidence to make a compelling case that Met4/32 and their target genes cluster and that this leads to an increase in transcription of these genes in the induced state. First, they found that, in the induced state, Met4/32 forms co-localized puncta in vivo. This is supported by in vitro studies showing that these TFs can form condensates in vitro with Med32 being the driver of these condensates. They found that two target genes, MET6 and MET13 have a higher probability of being co-localized with Met4 puncta compared with non-target loci. Using a targeted DNA methylation assay, they found that MET13 and MET6 show Met4-dependent long-range interactions with other Met4-regulated loci, consistent with the clustering of at least some target genes under induced conditions. Finally, by inserting a Met4-regulated reporter gene at variable distances from MET6, they provide evidence that insertion near this gene is a modest hotspot for activity.</p><p>Weaknesses:</p><p>(1) Please provide more information on the assay for puncta formation (Figure 1). It's unclear to me from the description provided how this assay was able to quantitate the number of puncta in cells.</p></disp-quote><p>Due to the variation in puncta size and intensity (as illustrated in Figure 1A), counting the number of puncta would be highly subjective with arbitrary cutoffs. Therefore, we chose to calculate the CV and Fano values instead, which are unbiased measures. Proteins that form puncta will exhibit greater pixel-to-pixel variations in GFP intensity, resulting in higher CV and Fano values.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>(2) How does the number of puncta in cells correspond with the number of Met-regulated genes? What are the implications of this calculation?</p></disp-quote><p>As previously mentioned, defining the exact number of Met4 puncta is challenging. The number of puncta does not necessarily have one-to-one correspondence to the number of Met4 target genes. Some puncta may not be associated with chromosomes, while others may interact with multiple genes.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>(3) A control for chromosomal insertion of the Met-regulated reporter was a GAL4 promoter derivative reporter. However, this control promoter seems 5-10 fold more active than the Met-regulated promoter (Figure 6). It's possible that the high activity from the control promoter overcomes some other limiting step such that chromosomal location isn't important. It would be ideal if the authors used a promoter with comparable activity to the Met-reporter as a control.</p></disp-quote><p>We agree with the reviewer that it will be better to use another promoter with comparable activity. Indeed, this was our rationale for selecting the attenuated <italic>GAL1</italic> promoter over the WT version; however, it still exhibited substantially higher activity than the <italic>MET3pr</italic>. Unfortunately, we do not have a promoter from a different pathway that is calibrated to match the activity level of <italic>MET3pr</italic>. Nonetheless, <italic>MET17pr</italic> has much higher activity (~3 fold) than <italic>MET3pr</italic>, and we observed similar degree of stimulus from the hotspot in comparison to the control locus for both promoters (1.5-2-fold increase in GFP expression) (Figure 6E &amp; F). This suggests that the observed effects are more likely to depend on the activation pathway and TF identity rather than the promoter strength.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p>(4) It seems like transcription from a very large number of genes is altered in the Met4 IDR mutant (Figure 7F). Why is this and could this variability affect the conclusions from this experiment?</p></disp-quote><p>We agree with the reviewer that ΔIDR 2.3 truncation affects the expression of 2711 (P-adj &lt;0.05) genes (1339 up,1372 down). We suspect that this is due to the decreased expression of Met4 target genes, leading to altered levels of methionine and other sulfur-containing metabolites. Such changes would have a global impact on gene expression. Importantly, despite the similar number of genes that show up vs down regulation in the ΔIDR 2.3 strain, almost all Met4 targets showed decreased expression (Fig 7F). This supports the model where Met4 condensates lead to increased expression in its target genes.</p><disp-quote content-type="editor-comment"><p><bold>Recommendations for the authors:</bold></p><p><bold>Reviewer #1 (Recommendations for The Authors):</bold></p><p>(1) The introduction contains multiple miscitations. Rather than gene clustering, most of the studies and reviews cited (e.g., lines 35-39) report interactions between genomic loci (E-E, E-P, and P-P).
